FT  12 MAR 94 / Privacy law delayed by doubts over right to sue


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


Government plans to introduce privacy legislation face further delay because
of doubts about how best to create a right to sue for breach of privacy.
It could be summer before a long-expected white paper is published, nearly a
year after it was first promised.
The white paper, which was due to be published later this month, has been
delayed because of the concern of Mr John Major and ministers about the
section creating a new tort - or civil wrong - of breach of privacy.
The main issue causing difficulty is how to make the right to sue available
to everyone. Failure to do so could call into question the wisdom of
introducing the tort while creating a bonanza for lawyers protecting the
privacy of the rich and famous.
A meeting involving all the government departments involved, ranging from
National Heritage and the Lord Chancellor's Department to the Home Office
and Downing Street, will be called to resolve the remaining difficulty.
The National Heritage Department said yesterday the white paper was unlikely
to be published until after Easter.
The government is determined to push ahead with introducing criminal
offences covering electronic eavesdropping or using long-range lenses to
take pictures on private property. The offences, outlined in the Calcutt
report, would apply to everyone and not just journalists.
