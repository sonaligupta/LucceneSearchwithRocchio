FT  12 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Bottomley rejects routine Aids
tests


HEALTH SERVICE workers who believe they have any condition, including the
Aids virus, which might put their patients at risk must seek medical advice,
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, told the Commons yesterday.
But she rejected calls for the routine testing of NHS staff for HIV
infection on the grounds that it was not justified and might result in the
issue being driven 'underground'.
