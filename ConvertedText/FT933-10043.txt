FT  06 AUG 93 / Private company law to be eased


   By TIM KING


THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry has suggested changes to company law to
help members of private companies to make resolutions without calling a
general meeting.
Private companies have been able to make resolutions outside a general
meeting as long as written approval has been obtained from all members who
would have been entitled to vote at a general meeting.
But the 1989 Companies Act prescribed that any proposed written resolution
must be sent to the company's auditors. It would only be valid if the
auditors notified the company that they did not see a need for a general
meeting or if seven days elapsed without the auditors replying.
The department is now proposing revoking the 1989 amendment and dispensing
with the requirement to consult auditors.
The department said yesterday: 'It could be argued that this only serves to
introduce unnecessary delay and complexity into the procedures and
discourages companies from making use of them.' It acknowledged that
removing the requirement to notify auditors might be seen as 'reducing the
safeguards available for shareholders'.
Mrs Margaret Chamberlain, of solicitors Travers Smith Braithwaite, a member
of the British Venture Capital Association's legal and technical committee,
said she did not see that shareholders' safeguards would be affected. The
law still required all members to be notified and to approve changes.
She said the 1989 change was meant to simplify matters, but had done the
opposite causing confusion for newly created companies which might have no
auditors.
A less radical proposal from the department is to make clear that companies
without auditors, either dormant or new, are entitled to use the statutory
written procedure.
Written resolutions are not permitted for the removal of directors or
auditors before their period of office ends.
