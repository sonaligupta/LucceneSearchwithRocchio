   By JOHN SIMKINS


   MILAN


The Italian government has reacted cautiously to suggestions at the UN that
Rome might send troops to reinforce peacekeepers in Bosnia, writes John
Simkins from Milan. Mr Beniamino Andreatta, foreign minister, did not rule
out an Italian contingent but said no request had yet been received from the
UN.
Meanwhile, Belgium yesterday ruled out sending more troops to former
Yugoslavia.
