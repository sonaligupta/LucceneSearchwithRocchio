half

   FRANKFURT


BAYERISCHE Hypotheken- und Wechsel-Bank (Hypo-Bank) yesterday said group
operating profits rose nearly 12.7 per cent to DM769m (Dollars 513m) in the
first half of this year.
Higher lending volume and improved margins had enabled the bank to lift net
interest income by 16.4 per cent to DM1.6bn, while net fee income was 6.6
per cent up at DM266m.
The bank said it was still following a cautious risk policy and ensuring
that credit volume in eastern Germany did not grow excessively.
Hypo-Bank was optimistic about prospects for the rest of the year, based on
lively credit demand.
Total group lending, including mortgage business, rose by 6.8 per cent to
DM161bn between December 31 1991 and the end of June.
The bank said group partial operating profits were 23 per cent higher at
DM759m.
This was after a drop of 84 per cent to DM10m in profits on own account
trading. All comparisons are with half of the figure for the whole of 1991.
