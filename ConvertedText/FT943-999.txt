FT  27 SEP 94 / Chief may face assault charge


   By MARK SUZMAN


Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, South Africa's home affairs minister and Inkatha
Freedom Party leader, could face an assault charge after barging into a
Durban television studio on Sunday night and forcing a political opponent,
Prince Sifiso Zulu, off the air, Mark Suzman reports.
Chief Buthelezi, who had been watching the programme in an adjoining studio,
apparently took exception to some remarks by Prince Zulu, and, with
bodyguards, forced his way into the interview room. Prince Zulu said he
intended to press charges against the chief. The entire incident was carried
live on the main current affairs programme.
