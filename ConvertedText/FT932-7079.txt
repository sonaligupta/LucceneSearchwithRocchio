   By DAVID HELLIER and ROBERT PESTON


COOPERS & Lybrand, the accountants appointed to investigate allegations of
overspending at the headquarters of the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, yesterday briefed a meeting of finance officials on the remit
of the firm's planned inquiry.
The meeting, convened by Sweden's Finance Minister Anne Wibble, in her
capacity as chair of the bank's board of governors, was held at the UK
Treasury.
Coopers & Lybrand have been called in by the bank's internal audit committee
to help it investigate the cost of the headquarters' project.
'We are sure that Coopers will do a good and thorough job of this,' said one
official who had attended the meeting. He added: 'There is a firm desire to
get to the bottom of the affair and there is a very firm aim to get the
report completed by July 15.'
The meeting was described as low key and was intended as an informative
session for the finance officials of the leading industrial nations.
The bank's internal audit committee is also examining the EBRD's budget
control systems, its lending record and the use during last year of private
jets.
