FT  28 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Continuing zinc glut forecast


   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent


The zinc market faced severe difficulties because of oversupply, the
International Lead & Zinc Study Group, an inter-governmental organisation,
warned yesterday. It dropped a broad hint that member governments should
urge their industries to take action to halt the oversupply that is swelling
stocks and depressing prices.
The study group said that information supplied by its members showed that
zinc metal production outside the former communist countries was on course
to repeat last year's record of 5.47m tonnes. Imports from eastern Europe
might be a little below the 'extremely high' 415,000 tonnes reached last
year, 'but at present there is little indication of a major reduction'.
Meanwhile, zinc consumption was forecast to improve by 1.6 per cent to 5.57m
tonnes, thanks to strong growth in North America and South East Asia.
The study group warned that 'a further substantial surplus of metal appears
inevitable unless metal production is reduced from levels currently
planned.' Stocks already are equivalent to nearly four months consumption
with 1.14m tonnes in London Metal Exchange warehouses alone.
Zinc prices have fallen by 10 per cent from the already-depressed Dollars
1,040 a tonne reached just before European producers admitted in
mid-February that their attempts to end over-capacity by the co-ordinated
closure of one or two smelters had collapsed. It was the second attempt to
deal with the structural overcapacity that has plagued the European zinc
industry for 20 years via the industry sharing the cost of smelter closures.
It is widely believed that the zinc smelter 'shut-down' deal fell apart
because producers believed some rivals had such huge financial difficulties
that they would be forced to close smelters anyway.
