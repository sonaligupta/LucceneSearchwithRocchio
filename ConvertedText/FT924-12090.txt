FT  22 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Wensum in loss and halves interim


Wensum Company, a men's wear manufacturer, is halving its interim dividend
to 0.575p after incurring a loss of Pounds 46,000 for the six months to July
31.
That stemmed from a reduction in turnover from Pounds 4.18m to Pounds 2.83m,
and compared with a profit of Pounds 332,000.
Losses per share were 0.43p against earnings of 2.97p.
Mr Andrew Hughes, chairman, said overheads had been held in firm control
against continued poor trading in the high street.
Operating profit was just Pounds 10,000 (Pounds 403,000).
The corporate clothing division saw the greater decline in turnover as
repeat business continued to reflect lower staff numbers. Many customers
were also extending the life of uniforms.
Mr Hughes said turnover in Wensum Clothing, the manufacturing division, fell
following the loss of GA Dunn, historically one of the most important
customers.
However, recovery was on the way as the customer base continued to be
broadened, resulting in a strong order book throughout the remainder of the
second half and well into the first half of next year.
