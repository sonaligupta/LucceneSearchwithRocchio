FT  15 APR 94 / Medway directors to sue in share row


   By STEWART DALBY and IAN HAMILTON FAZEY


Two company directors dismissed by Mr Peter Vincent, the former Medway Ports
chief executive who made Pounds 12m when his company was taken over last
September by the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company, are to sue accountants
KPMG Peat Marwick.
They are claiming negligence and false valuation arising from the price paid
by Mersey docks for the Medway ports. Some 270 dockers dismissed by the
company in November 1993 are likely to take similar action. The dockers won
an industrial tribunal ruling in March that they had been unfairly
dismissed, and hope action against KPMG will lead to further court moves for
restitution of shareholdings.
Mersey docks bought Medway Ports for Pounds 104m, valuing each share at
Pounds 37.50. Three months earlier KPMG Peat Marwick had valued the shares
at Pounds 2.50. Medway had insisted that the two dismissed directors and 270
dockers - who had been given or bought shares in the company at
privatisation in 1992 - sell their shares back to the company at the KPMG
valuation.
Mr Vincent, who bought shares equivalent to those sold by the two directors
in June 1992 at 250p, resigned from the board of Mersey docks on Wednesday,
citing a desire to pursue other interests.
Mersey docks' annual report, published three weeks ago, makes clear that Mr
Vincent was expected to have a long career with the company.
The Medway acquisition led to his becoming the largest individual
shareholder, and share options offered him an opportunity to secure
substantial gains from 1996.
Mr Vincent acquired 921,486 ordinary shares in Mersey docks - 1.03 per cent
of the total on the market - on becoming a director on October 19. Two days
later he and two other Medway directors were granted 125,000 irrevocable
share options each at a subscription price of 397p, exercisable between
October 1996 and October 2003.
