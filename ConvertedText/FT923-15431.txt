FT  02 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Japanese exchanges plan to
form secondary market


   By REUTER


   TOKYO


FIVE regional stock exchanges in Japan plan to set up a secondary stock
market with easier listing requirements, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
Officials said the exchanges, in Sapporo, Niigata, Kyoto, Hiroshima and
Fukuoka, would accept listing applications from today. They expect to see
the first listing on the new section by the end of this year.
The listing criteria will be the same as for the new second section of the
Osaka Securities Exchange, which requires companies to have at least 1m
shares outstanding and at least 300 shareholders at the time of listing.
At present, companies that want to list on the ordinary sections of the
regional exchanges must have at least 2m shares outstanding and 400
shareholders. Stricter profit and dividend criteria also apply.
Japan has eight stock exchanges, Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya plus the five
regional exchanges.
