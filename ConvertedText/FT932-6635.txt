FT  27 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Rolls-Royce trading still tough


   By PAUL BETTS


ROLLS-ROYCE, the UK aero-engine and industrial power group, warned yesterday
that trading conditions would remain under pressure over the next two years,
writes Paul Betts.
He saw little prospect of an improvement in market conditions until 1995,
but Sir Ralph Robins, chairman, told the annual general meeting that the
group was 'determined not to be swept off course.'
The high level of investment in research and development necessary for
long-term growth strategies would continue.
Describing market conditions as 'very difficult', Sir Ralph said that the
group's current level of profitability was 'quite unsatisfactory.'
Rolls-Royce reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 184m last year, reflecting
restructuring provisions of Pounds 268m.
The company has also announced plans to reduce its workforce by a further
5,000 people over the next two years.
But Sir Ralph said he believed the company's strategies would strengthen its
position in world markets when the recovery eventually occured.
