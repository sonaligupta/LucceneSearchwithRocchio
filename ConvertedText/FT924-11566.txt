FT  24 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: Why credit is still costly - A rates
anomaly


   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU


BANK BASE rates have changed 12 times since the beginning of last year,
falling from 14 per cent to 8 per cent. Yet most credit card issuers have
only cut their interest rates two or three times over that period.
Barclays, for example, the largest issuer of credit cards, with 8.7m cards
in circulation, has announced it will be cutting its rate on November 1 in
response to the recent base rate cuts. But this will be the first time its
rates have changed for two and a half years.
Barclaycard's new rate will be down to 24.9 per cent APR, which is just over
5 percentage points less than the 29.8 per cent APR prevailing from July
1989 to June 1990. Since the latter date, base rates have fallen by 7
percentage points.
The average credit card annual percentage rate, according to the Credit Card
Research Group, is 25.7 per cent APR, once planned cuts over the next few
weeks are taken into account. This compares with an average of 29.7 per cent
APR in October 1990 - the month when base rates fell from 15 to 14 per cent.
National & Provincial, which last altered the interest rate on its Visa card
in February to 24 per cent APR, says that it does not have plans at the
moment to make another cut. 'We're watching things closely but we're finding
that other issuers are coming down to our levels,' said a spokesman for the
building society.
Many consumers are baffled by the slow speed at which banks and building
societies react to base rate changes and one reader wrote to the Weekend FT
wondering whether credit card issuers are 'profiteering' from such high
rates on interest.
The institutions argue that they are struggling to make a profit on a
service which they believe is competitive and worth the cost. Some
institutions made a loss in 1990 but, with the introduction of annual fees,
most have moved back into profit.
Barclays does not break down its figures for its credit card operation but
in 1990, the personal loans and mortgages department, which includes
Barclaycard, made a loss of Pounds 4.3m. Last year the department made a
profit of Pounds 45.7m.
'The cost of buying funds on the money markets only represents half our
costs,' said Christine Tucker, of Barclaycard. 'The other costs are fraud,
bad debt and operational costs for providing our services worldwide.'
Credit card and charge card fraud is estimated to have amounted to Pounds
100m last year and the Association for Payment Clearing Services has said it
will be spending Pounds 500m over the next three years to fight fraud.
Institutions argue that credit card rates cannot react in the same way to
base rate changes as mortgage rates do. 'When there is a base rate cut, it
tends to be a 0.5 or 1 percentage point cut but when a credit card rate is
lowered, it does so by more than that,' said Elizabeth Phillips, director of
Credit Card Research Group. 'When a cut is made, all the literature has to
be changed and that can cost as much as Pounds 250,000 for a major issuer.'
Banks and building societies say they prefer to watch interest rate trends
and adjust their own rates accordingly. The Royal Bank of Scotland, which
last cut its credit card interest rate in January, was ambivalent, earlier
in the week, about whether a further cut would follow. 'As interest rates
fall, we are watching and waiting until everything settles,' said a
spokesman for the bank. It has since confirmed that it will be cutting the
interest rate on its credit cards.
While the institutions argue that the cost of borrowing on credit cards is
good value, the Consumers' Association says the rates are still high. 'We
thought their rates were too high when we published a report on credit cards
a year ago. A year on, base rates are still falling but credit card rates
are still too slow to come down,' said Graeme Jacobs, a spokesman.
Meanwhile, consumers should be aware that issuers have introduced ways of
cutting costs at their expense.
Previously, if you had not cleared your bill by the date stated, interest
would be charged from the date the statement was issued. Nowadays, almost
all the large issuers charge interest from the transaction date, which is
when the purchase is charged to the issuer, usually a few days after it is
made.
Consumers have also found it difficult to compare the real cost of borrowing
between issuers because the method of calculating the APR has varied since
the introduction of fees. Happily, this is set to change following an
agreement between leading card suppliers on a standard method of
calculation. Some issuers, including Co-Op, National & Provincial, TSB and
Yorkshire bank, are still fee-free.
