FT  08 NOV 94 / Bow doors faulty on 33% of ferries using UK ports:
Government to increase safety checks on vessels


   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent


The government is to increase checks on roll-on roll-off ferries after one
in three of the vessels operating from British ports was found to have
faulty bow doors.
Thirty-five of the 107 ferries inspected had minor defects when the
Department of Transport's marine safety agency carried out the checks after
the sinking of the ferry Estonia in the Baltic in September with the loss of
900 lives.
The faults included leaky rubber seals and fractures to brackets and
fittings on the bow doors. Dr Brian Mawhinney, transport secretary, said
yesterday that all the vessels tested were watertight and fundamentally
sound.
However, one vessel, the Winston Churchill, a Danish-flagged ferry plying
between Newcastle and Esbjerg, was temporarily detained for repairs to its
stern door.
The findings come just before the start of passenger shuttle services
through the Channel tunnel that are expected to take a large share of the
ferries' cross-Channel business.
Ships flying the UK flag had a higher incidence of defects than the
foreign-flagged vessels. Of the 58 UK-flagged vessels, 36 per cent needed
repairs, compared with 28 per cent of the 49 foreign-flagged ships.
Dr Mawhinney said he was surprised that faults had been found with as many
as 35 ferries. He was in Dover watching tests on the inner bow doors of the
Pride of Calais, a six-year-old vessel operated by P&O European ferries.
Water from a high-pressure hose failed to penetrate the door seals.
Dr Mawhinney said the marine safety agency had been asked to increase the
number of unscheduled inspections and to write to all ferry operators to
remind them of the need to pay attention 'to even the smallest safety
detail, so as to maintain safety standards at the highest levels'.
The agency is also to carry out computer studies on the effect of water
penetrating bow doors and whether internal bulkheads, urged by the Royal
Institution of Naval Architects and others, would make any difference. The
government would order a redesign of ferries only if there was strong
evidence that bulkheads would provide a safety benefit.
UK ferries are surveyed once every 12 months by agency inspectors when the
passenger ship safety certificate is renewed. Unscheduled inspections are
carried out at least twice a year.
Since the sinking of the Herald of Free Enterprise in 1987 with the loss of
193 lives, teams of surveyors also travel incognito on ferries operating
from UK ports to observe them at work.
