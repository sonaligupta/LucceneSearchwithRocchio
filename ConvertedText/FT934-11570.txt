FT  30 OCT 93 / Row looms over MPs' 5.5% pay rise plan


   By DAVID OWEN


A ROW was brewing last night over plans to offer pay rises to MPs that would
increase their salaries by more than 5.5 per cent.
Union leaders joined MPs from across the political spectrum in attacking the
proposed rise which would take effect in two stages by January 1995.
If implemented, the move would be widely expected to stiffen resistance to
the government's efforts to rein in public-sector pay. Ministers are this
year seeking to impose a 1.5 per cent ceiling on the public-sector pay bill,
and may try to impose a freeze next year.
Mr Alan Jinkinson, leader of Unison, Britain's biggest union, said it would
be 'grossly hypocritical' for ministers and MPs to vote themselves such an
increase. The move would 'result in my members . . . redoubling their
efforts to achieve justice in the next pay round'.
Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB general union, said: 'Aren't they the
lucky ones? I wish our members had the chance to vote themselves a pay rise
at twice the rate of inflation.'
Mr Michael Bates, the Conservative MP for Langbaurgh, described the plan as
'an absolute outrage' and called for MPs to lead by example.
Mr Max Madden, Labour MP for Bradford West, said salary increases should
apply only to MPs who did not have outside financial interests.
Under the proposals - which will be debated next Wednesday - MPs would be
awarded a 2.7 per cent increase, taking their salaries to Pounds 31,687 with
effect from January 1994. This would be followed by a further 2.68 per cent
the following year. The government also proposes a new remuneration formula
linking MPs' pay to civil service bands.
MPs did vote themselves a 38 per cent rise in office-cost allowances to
nearly Pounds 40,000 a year in July 1992.
