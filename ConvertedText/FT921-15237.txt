FT  11 JAN 92 / Finance & The Family: Interest in PEPS increases


Inland Revenue figures show that investment in Personal Equity Plans has
shot up since they were introduced. This is reflected in the 10th edition of
Chase De Vere's Pepguide, now available. It should prove useful to anyone
planning to take out a Personal Equity Plan in the run up to the end of the
tax year in April.
The guide contains a list of all 486 PEPs, from 202 managers, on the market
at the end of last year. Information is included on charges, minimum and
maximum investments, penalties, and share exchange facilities, along with
more technical details. There is also a list of addresses. The guide costs
Pounds 8.95, but this will be refunded if you choose to buy a PEP through
Chase De Vere.
