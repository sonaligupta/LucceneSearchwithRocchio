FT  07 JAN 94 / UK Company News: MAM adds to investment operations


   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent


Mercury Asset Management, the UK's largest fund management group, has agreed
in principle to buy the fund management business of River and Mercantile
Trust, one of the oldest UK investment trust companies.
The move is part of MAM's effort to diversify its businesses, which are
overwhelmingly dependent on the UK pension fund market, and expand into
services for private investors. Terms were not disclosed.
MAM, like other leading fund managers, is concerned that regulatory changes
and rising expenses will prompt employers to abandon the final salary
pension schemes which have formed the core of their businesses.
Of MAM's Pounds 56bn under management as of September 30 1993, Pounds 40bn
represented assets of UK pension funds, while Pounds 10bn came from
international clients and a further Pounds 6bn belonged to private
investors.
'We have wanted to diversify our business into the international side and
the private investor side,' said Mr David Rosier, managing director of MAM's
private investor businesses. 'A gap in our armour was that we had no
investment trusts, bar one.' Last year, MAM raised Pounds 426m with its
Mercury World Mining Trust.
River and Mercantile Investment Management, which is to be acquired by MAM,
was formed in 1985 as the fund management arm of River and Mercantile Trust,
an investment trust formed in 1881. It specialises in managing split-capital
investment trusts which concentrate on the selection of stocks with high
dividend streams. Its 15 staff will be employed by MAM.
The fund management company looks after about Pounds 400m, of which Pounds
215m is in its original investment trust. It has four other investment
trusts and runs personal equity plans for roughly 3,500 individual clients.
