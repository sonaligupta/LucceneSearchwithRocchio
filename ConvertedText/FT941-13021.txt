FT  27 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Sun Life new single premiums top Pounds 2bn


   By ALISON SMITH


Sun Life yesterday said that its new single premium business exceeded Pounds
2bn for the first time.
Announcing its new business figures for 1993, the life insurance group said
the increase to Pounds 2.2bn represented a rise of almost 60 per cent on the
1992 figure of Pounds 1.4bn.
New regular premium business rose by 24 per cent from Pounds 86m to Pounds
107m over the year.
Mr John Reeve, managing director, welcomed the results but sought to play
down expectations for 1994.
'Our new business has more than doubled over the last three years, which is
well beyond the performance of the market as a whole: our immediate focus is
now on consolidation at the new levels achieved,' he said.
Total new premiums in 1993 rose by 55 per cent to Pounds 2.3bn, but the
group said that a better indicator of performance was the 45 per cent
increase in new business measured on the basis of an index of new regular
premiums and one tenth of new single premiums.
The overall increases came despite falls in new business from both single
and regular premium final salary and money purchase schemes.
New premium income in 1993 at Friends Provident, the mutually-owned life and
pensions group, also reflected the trend in the market towards single
premium business.
The increase in its new single premium income to Pounds 518m (Pounds 392m)
more than offset the fall in new annual premium income to Pounds 93m (Pounds
115m).
