FT  29 OCT 93 / Observer: Off line


In an attempt to display a sense of humour, Switzerland's PTT decided to
dispense with the usual children's drawings or maps of the area on its
telephone directory covers, and to go for cartoons instead.
The idea was to send up regional telephony habits, with the one for the
Valais, for example, showing punters queueing up atop the Matterhorn to use
a phone booth.
However, though the cartoons were vetted by psychologists, feminists,
vegetarians and all manner of special interest groups, no bells of alarm
rang over the cover for the Geneva directory. This features two fattish Arab
men in traditional robes standing beside their shiny Mercedes looking at the
city's famous water fountain spurting high above Lac Leman. 'Transparent
oil]', shouts one into his cellular telephone.
Unsurprisingly, the city's large Arab community is in high dudgeon, and an
official protest to the Swiss was duly lodged by the Arab mission at the
United Nations in Geneva. This in turn elicited an abject apology from PTT.
'Next time we will not try to be so original,' says Dieter Max Syx, the
chief executive.
