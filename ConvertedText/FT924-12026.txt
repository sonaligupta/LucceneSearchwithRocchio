quarter

CSX, the US transportation company, yesterday unveiled a 19 per cent advance
in third-quarter net earnings to Dollars 128m, or Dollars 1.25 a share, from
Dollars 108m, or Dollars 1.07, a year ago.
Operating revenue was essentially unchanged at Dollars 2.21bn, while
operating income advanced 9 per cent to Dollars 262m.
The company attributed its improved performance to operating efficiencies
and reductions in the long-term cost base of its transportation units.
Operating income at CSX's rail business rose 14 per cent to Dollars 182m,
although rail loadings slipped 2 per cent in the quarter. The company said
earnings were helped by cost cuts which offset lacklustre rail operating
revenue.
Union Pacific, another US transportation company, saw a 9 per cent rise in
underlying third-quarter earnings, reflecting gains in all four of its
operating companies.
Net income was Dollars 185m, or 91 cents a share. A year earlier, a one-time
after-tax charge of Dollars 575m pushed the company into the red, with a
deficit of Dollars 406m, or Dollars 2.01. Stripping out the charge, the
company earned Dollars 169m, or 84 cents, in the 1991 third quarter.
Operating revenues stood 3 per cent higher at Dollars 1.85bn in the 1992
quarter against Dollars 1.74bn the previous year.
