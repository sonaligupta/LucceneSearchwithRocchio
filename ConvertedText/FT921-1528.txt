FT  24 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Sea Containers undecided on IoM stake


   By MAGGIE URRY


MR JAMES Sherwood, president of Sea Containers, the Bermuda-based container
leasing, ferries and hotels group, which bid for the Isle of Man Steam
Packet Company in 1990, said that Sea Containers had not yet decided what to
do with its 41 per cent stake in Isle of Man.
However, he said that after the experiences of 1989-90, when there was a
joint bid for Sea Containers from Stena of Sweden and Tiphook of the UK,
that he 'wished to avoid another adventure in the hostile takeover arena'.
Eventually Sea Containers sold Sealink, the cross-channel ferry operator, to
Stena and some of its container assets to Tiphook.
Mr Sherwood made the comments when reporting on a 'dull' final quarter to
1991, breaking even at the net level. For the year, net earnings were
Dollars 32.7m or Dollars 1.95 a share. The 1990 figures are not comparable
since they include large profits from the asset sales.
Mr Sherwood said 'the underlying trend of the company's business was up and
would emerge in 1992 for all to see'. The 1991 figures would be a benchmark
for the future, he said.
Sea Containers is planning a new class of equity, carrying greater dividends
but fewer votes, which, Mr Sherwood said, would give the company 'greater
flexibility in future financings'.
