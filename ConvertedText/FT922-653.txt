FT  26 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Brazilian telecom group gains
OTC listing in US


   By BILL HINCHBERGER


   SAO PAULO


THE Brazilian government said yesterday it would allow the trading of
American depositary receipts in Telebras, the state-owned telecommunications
holding company, on the US over-the-counter market.
The move allows the company to take advantage of exemptions under US
Securities and Exchange Commission rules and therefore avoid full US-style
corporate disclosure. But it would not permit the company to launch an
offering of shares on the US market.
The announcement reduced uncertainty caused by the cancellation this month
of a planned Dollars 1.3bn ADR placement by Telebras. The official
explanation was that a large issue might erode the share price, with a
negative affect on privatisation plans.
However, the cancellation led to speculation about the privatisation of
Telebras, and some expectation that the government might decide to sell its
subsidiaries separately instead of disposing of the holding company in one
move. Telebras shares have fallen 45 per cent this month, although they
rebounded modestly in morning trading yesterday.
Telebras weighs heavily on the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange (Bovespa),
representing about a third of the Bovespa index and generally accounting for
half of daily trading.
The privatisation method was not discussed at the Wednesday meeting between
government and Telebras officials that reached the decision on the ADRs,
said Mr Roberto Wright, head of Telebras's division of capital market
control.
Mr Wright said that the step into the secondary market 'opens a precedent'
and would make it easier to secure an exchange listing and an offering of
shares in the future.
