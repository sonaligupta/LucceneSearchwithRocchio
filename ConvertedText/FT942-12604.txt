FT  28 APR 94 / World Stock Markets: Toronto marks time in the absence of
Wall Street


Canada
In the absence of Wall Street Toronto stocks edged higher led by gains in
the precious metals, real estate and mining sectors.
Dealers said that the market would continue to focus on results from the
current first quarter earnings period.
The TSE 300 index was up 5.99 at 4,269.79 by mid morning on volume of 4.3m
shares valued at CDollars 46.5m. Advances led declines 133 to 92, with 168
stocks unchanged.
Of Toronto's 14 sub-groups, 10 indices gained ground in early trading.
The gold and silver index climbed 62.32 or 0.67 per cent, to 9,328.62.
Strong gold stocks were led by Placer Dome, up CDollars  3/8 to CDollars 28
1/8 in light volume.
Other rising sectors included mining, up 24.93 to 3,487.64, and real estate
which rose 20.67 to 3,046.21.
Among active stocks, Northern Telecom extended Tuesday's gains after posting
an unexpected first quarter profit. The stock gained CDollars 3/8 to
CDollars 41 3/8 on 27,500 shares.
Venezuela
Venezuelan equities fell back following the resignation on Tuesday of the
president of the central bank over a disagreement regarding the government's
economic policies. President Ruth de Krivoy said her decision was
'irrevocable'. The bank said that three other directors had also resigned.
On Tuesday the general index lost 0.5 per cent.
Brazil
Equities in Sao Paulo recovered from earlier lows, but remained down at
mid-morning in thin trade as the market awaited news on whether congress
would vote on anti-inflation legislation. The Bovespa index was off 1.4 per
cent at 15,618 in thin volume of CR52bn (Dollars 42m).
