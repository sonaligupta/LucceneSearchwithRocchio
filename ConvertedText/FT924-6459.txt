FT  20 NOV 92 / Pounds 1m award after water source is polluted


A WATER company was awarded more than Pounds 1m damages yesterday against a
leather producer that was held liable for contamination of the public
supply.
The Pounds 1,064,886 award against Eastern Counties Leather, of Sawston in
Cambridgeshire, is expected to almost double when interest is added.
Three appeal judges in London ordered payment of the damages after allowing
an application by Cambridge Water against the refusal of a High Court judge
to make an award.
The leather company said it would seek leave to appeal to the House of
Lords.
Cambridge Water started using a borehole at Sawston Mill in 1979. In 1983
tests were introduced for the chemical perchloroethene. Traces many times
the permitted level were found in the water. The company ceased pumping and
had to pay for a new borehole at Hinxton Grange.
