FT  28 JAN 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Roulette adapted to slot
machine


   By DELLA BRADSHAW


Gamblers who favour the uncertainty of the roulette wheel should soon be
able to play their favourite game in the local games arcade. McNally
Industries has combined the game of roulette with electronic slot machine
technology to produce the Rapid Roulette Slot Machine, which is to be
marketed by Sega Deith of London, part of the Japanese Sega empire.
The player inserts coins or tokens and chooses which numbers to bet on by
pressing buttons. A free-spinning roulette wheel spins automatically,
turning rapidly and then slowing to allow the ball to drop into one of the
numbered slots. Sega Deith: UK, 081 336 1222.
