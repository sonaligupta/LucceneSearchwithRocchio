FT  23 JUL 93 / Greeks move on privatisation


   By KERIN HOPE


   ATHENS


The Greek government yesterday removed obstacles to private sector
construction and operation of power stations, despite objections from
rebellious deputies in the ruling New Democracy party, writes Kerin Hope in
Athens. Workers at Deh, the state-owned power corporation, called a 48-hour
strike in protest against the new law.
