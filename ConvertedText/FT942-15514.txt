FT  14 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading


   By JOEL KIBAZO


Weakness in UK gilts caused a reversal of early gains in stock index futures
which in turn pulled the underlying cash market lower, writes Joel Kibazo.
Buyers of the June contract on the FT-SE 100 saw it advance to 3,178 in
early trading. However that early buying ran out of steam as dealers waited
for the US Consumer Prices Index figures and a mood of caution set in ahead
of today's Bundesbank Council meeting.
The release of the US data over the lunch time period had little impact to
trading but it was the continuing weakness in bonds that brought the
afternoon falls in the contract as Wall Street also came off sharply.
June finished at 3,141, down 29 on its previous close and at a significant
discount to cash. Dealers said the volume of 10,673 at the official close
was an indication of a lack of willingness to deal amidst the uncertainity.
The Liffe FT-SE mid 250 finished at 3,790 after trading 50 contracts.
Turnover in the traded options was 42,209 lots against Tuesday's total of
47,125 lots. The FT-SE 100 option traded 14,847 lots and the Euro FT-SE 100
option which was particularly busy saw business of 7,5 17 contracts.
