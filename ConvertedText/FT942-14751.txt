FT  19 APR 94 / Observer: Double trouble


Britain's John Major had an unusual opportunity yesterday to compare notes
with a fellow prime minister who came to office on exactly the same day in
1990: Goh Chok Tong of Singapore.
That's not all the two have in common. Goh has had a few political problems
of his own - the odd electoral setback, for example, and the tendency of his
predecessor Lee Kuan Yew to deliver stern rebukes when the government has
looked like straying from his chosen path.
On the whole, however, with Singapore's economy growing at nearly 10 per
cent a year and support for the authoritarian ruling party running at 61 per
cent at the last count, Major had to acknowledge that Goh's little local
difficulties are ones he can only dream of.
