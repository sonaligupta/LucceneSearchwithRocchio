FT  29 JUN 93 / FT Exporter (15): How Uvex made its mark


   By TONY BUSH


ONE of the inevitable problems with the European Community-wide 'CE Mark' is
that it can be based on the lowest common denominator.
Uvex, of Germany, an international leader in industrial and leisure
safetywear, has by-passed it.
The company had a sense of certainty when it entered the UK industrial
safety market nearly five years ago.
For its eyewear, it adopted British standards, which were higher than those
laid down by the Community.
For its footwear, however, it retained the German standards, which were
higher than those required from the British manufacturers.
'Whilst we are fully aware of the CE standards - and, indeed, we meet them -
we decided to stay with the stringent British standards for eyewear,'
commented David Howell, Uvex's UK managing director.
'No-one to date has asked us about CE marking on our products. Personally, I
feel this is a combination of people not being fully aware of it or really
worrying at this stage.
'We have simply stayed with the highest standards. It may be that in some
countries the CE marking provides consumers with a standard that is higher
than what they might have been used to previously.'
