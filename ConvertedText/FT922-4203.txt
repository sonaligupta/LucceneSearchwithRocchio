FT  06 JUN 92 / How To Spend It: The duke with perfect taste


   By LUCIA VAN DER POST


ANYONE who has taken an interest in costume jewellery will know the name of
Fulco de Vedura, the Sicilian duke, who, forced to earn his own living, came
to make jewellery that was as significant in its day as Chanel's clothes and
Lalique's glass.
He was lucky in his meeting with Chanel. Their tastes meshed perfectly. Both
loved splendour but loathed vulgarity. They despised the prevalent fashion
of putting huge diamonds in platinum settings ('One might just as well tie a
cheque around one's neck'). Verdura began designing great, colourful
Byzantine pieces that looked wonderful against the lean simplicity of her
jerseys and little dresses.
Between them they changed not just the look but also the culture of
jewellery. They brought to it a rich medieval splendour as well as wit and
insouciance.
One of the first things he designed for her were the cuff bracelets
embellished with Maltese crosses of multi-coloured stones which she wore
constantly.
The company he founded in New York, Verdura, is still going strong, (though
it was bought by E L Landrigan in 1985) and still making authentic copies of
many original pieces.
From June 8-16 there is a rare chance to see - and, if your cheque book is
accommodating enough, buy - some original Verdura pieces as well as modern
reproductions at 4 Ryder Street, St James's London SW1. Photographed, right
, are copies of Chanel's famous cuff bracelets. Made from cocholong
embellished with citrine, amethyst, rubies, diamonds and pearls they are
Dollars 15,000 (Pounds 8,333.30) a piece.
Though prices of the pieces are high (from Pounds 1,000 to thousands) the
exhibition is filled with visual delight - you do not need to spend a penny
to enjoy it.
