FT  02 NOV 93 / UK Company News: MIM Holdings buys UK zinc smelter


MIM Holdings, the Australian metals group, has finalised the purchase of a
zinc smelter and manufacturing plant at Avonmouth for Pounds 47.6m.
The Imperial Smelting Process smelter, which employs some 600 people, was
bought from Pasminco, and is designed to give MIM downstream zinc processing
capacity.
MIM directors said that the smelter could have particular strategic
significance once output from the McArthur River mine project comes on
stream in a couple of years' time.
The smelter has the capacity to produce 120,000 tonnes of zinc and 55,000
tonnes of lead bullion, while the associated manufacturing plant at Bloxwich
produces a range of value-added zinc products.
