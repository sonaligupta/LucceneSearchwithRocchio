FT  21 JUL 94 / International Company News: American Airlines dissatisfied
with rise


   By RICHARD TOMKINS


   NEW YORK


AMR, parent company of American Airlines, the second biggest US carrier,
reported net profits of Dollars 153m for the second quarter, up from Dollars
47m last time. However, the company said they were far from satisfactory.
The latest figure included a favourable adjustment of Dollars 22m relating
to a change in the cost of redeeming frequent flier points, while the
previous year's net profit would have been Dollars 59m without adjustments
for unusual items.
AMR comprises three divisions: air transportation, the Sabre information
technology businesses, and management services. The biggest profit
improvement came from air transportation, which contributed Dollars 149m
before tax compared with a pre-tax loss of Dollars 6m last time.
Sabre increased its pre-tax contribution to Dollars 95m from Dollars 80m,
and management services reduced its pre-tax contribution to Dollars 4m from
Dollars 5m.
AMR's turnround from a loss of Dollars 7m in the first quarter was expected
because airlines make more money in the summer than in the winter. The
airline was also helped by reducing capacity on unprofitable routes.
The shrinkage resulted in a 7.8 per cent decline in the number of available
seat miles flown. Group revenues also fell, by 2.6 per cent to Dollars
4.1bn. But passenger load factor (the percentage of seats filled by
passengers) rose to 64.4 per cent from 61.5 per cent.
Earnings per share rose to Dollars 1.68 from 39 cents fully diluted. Net
income for the first six months rose to Dollars 146m from Dollars 25m.
