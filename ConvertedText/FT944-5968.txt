FT  01 DEC 94 / The Budget: Reinsurance plans under scrutiny


The reinsurance arrangements of life insurance companies are among the
targets of the government's drive to close more tax loopholes. The aim is
that from next year reinsurance should not be a way for life companies to
protect investment returns from tax, but should be confined to reducing
their exposure to particular death risks.
Tax officials will consult the life insurance industry before setting out
how the rate of return will be calculated and which types of reinsurance
will be affected.
