FT  22 JUL 93 / International Company News: Strong sales help Pfizer to
Dollars 253m

PFIZER, the US pharmaceuticals group, recorded a 15 per cent increase in
post-tax profits in the second quarter, to Dollars 253.8m. The result was
attributed to higher sales volumes and a net gain of Dollars 27m from
non-recurring items.
A 3 per cent increase in turnover from a year ago, to Dollars 1.75bn, was
driven almost entirely by higher volume, with modest price rises largely
offset by currency factors, the company said. The healthcare division saw a
12 per cent increase in turnover, driven by a 15 per cent increase in drug
sales. Sales of animal health products grew 2 per cent, while turnover in
consumer healthcare products declined 2 per cent.
'This volume growth, combined with improved product mix and our ongoing
effort to control expenses, is resulting in our income growing considerably
faster than our sales,' said Mr William Steere, chairman.
Operating costs were cut to Dollars 988.7m from Dollars 1.2bn a year before,
while spending on research and development rose from Dollars 214m to Dollars
231m. The company's figures were boosted by a Dollars 60m pre-tax gain from
the sale of its 40 per cent interest in Minerals Technologies, partially
offset by restructuring charges of Dollars 33m.
Earnings per share rose to 79 cents a share (73 cents excluding the net gain
from the share sale), up from 66 cents a year ago.
First-half net income of Dollars 582.8m was ahead of the Dollars 234.6m of
the first six months of 1992, which was struck after accounting changes
reduced reported results by Dollars 283m. Pfizer's shares closed at Dollars
60, up Dollars  5/8 on the day.
Pharmaceutical sales at Bristol-Myers Squibb fell 1 per cent during the
second quarter compared with a year ago. The company blamed the drop on
lower sales of its Capoten cardiovascular drug and government
cost-containment measures in Germany and Italy.
However, sales of consumer healthcare products, medical devices and
nutritional products all rose strongly, resulting in a 3 per cent growth in
sales overall, to Dollars 2.8bn.
Net earnings rose to Dollars 520m, or Dollars 1.01 a share, up from Dollars
488m, or 92 cents a share, in the same period in 1992. First-half net net
income was Dollars 1.1bn, or Dollars 2.12 a share, against Dollars 789m, or
Dollars 1.53, last year.
