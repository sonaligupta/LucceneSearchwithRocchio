FT  16 MAR 94 / People: Carlton adjusts its managerial contrast


Carlton Communications moved yesterday to integrate the management structure
of its ITV operations following its recent acquisition of Central
Independent Television.
Andy Allan, right, managing director of Central, is to become chief
executive of Carlton UK Television from mid-April. A new managing director
of Central Television, yet to be appointed, will report to Allan, who will
also be responsible for the sales operation of the two ITV franchises, the
largest in the ITV network.
Allan, 51, has worked in broadcasting for nearly 30 years, beginning as a
presenter and producer and later becoming a programme editor in the light
entertainment department of ABC television. He is a former head of news at
Thames Television and joined Central as director of programmes in 1984 from
Tyne Tees Television, where he had been director of programmes and deputy
managing director. He is also a governor of the National Film and Television
School
Nigel Walmsley, the present chief executive of Carlton Television and an
administrator rather than a programme-maker, will move to the headquarters
of Carlton Communications as the main board director, with overall
responsibility for group broadcasting.
Both Carlton Television and Central will continue to operate under separate
boards, as part of the terms of their broadcasting licences.
'The opportunity to take responsibility for ITV's two largest broadcasters
is irresistible,' says Allan. Leslie Hill, chairman of the ITV Association
for the next two years, remains chairman of Central.
