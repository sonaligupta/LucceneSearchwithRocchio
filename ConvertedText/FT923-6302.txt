FT  25 AUG 92 / International Company News: Amcor acquires Leigh Mardon


   By KEVIN BROWN


AMCOR, the Australian packaging group, yesterday said it would pay ADollars
273m (USDollars 196m) for Leigh Mardon, a packaging, communications and
printing company with operations in Australia, Singapore and Hong Kong.
Leigh Mardon was sold by Coca-Cola Amatil for ADollars 260m two years ago to
a consortium of managers and financial institutions led by SBC Dominguez
Barry Capital Partners.
Amcor said it would finance the acquisition largely from its cash reserve of
about ADollars 200m, which includes ADollars 177m from the sale in July of
its 8.5 per cent shareholding in Mayne Nickless, the Australian transport
and distribution group.
Mr Stan Wallis, Amcor managing director, said Leigh Mardon's forecast sales
of nearly ADollars 300m this year would shore up the group's 'strong flow of
earnings' in Australia.
However, the acquisition will also provide a substantial boost to Amcor's
plans to expand its Asian packaging materials business.
Mr Ian Wilson, a director of SBC Dominguez Barry, said the consortium had
achieved 'a satisfactory return' on its investment in Leigh Mardon, in spite
of the difficult economic environment. Amcor shares closed seven cents lower
at ADollars 7.61 before the acquisition was announced.
