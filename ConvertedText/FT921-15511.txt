FT  09 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: American to fly business
class on domestic routes


   By NIKKI TAIT


AMERICAN Airlines, one of the three largest US carriers, is to introduce
'business class' travel - ranking between first class and coach in service
and price terms - on its New York-Los Angeles route. The service will start
on February 4, writes Nikki Tait.
Although US carriers often offer three classes on international flights,
three-tier pricing is unusual on domestic US flights.
American's main rivals, Delta and United, do offer business class on some
domestic flights when the aircraft is going on to an international
destination. United also plans to expand its business class service next
month, making it available on 149 domestic flights each week. This will
involve having business class seating on some aircraft 'dedicated' to flying
domestic routes, the carrier said.
American said it planned to reconfigure 10 DC-10 aircraft dedicated to the
LA-New York service, to include 52 business class seats in each.
