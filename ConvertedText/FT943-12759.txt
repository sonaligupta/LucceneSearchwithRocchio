FT  22 JUL 94 / International Company News: Saint-Louis in talks to double
Spanish stake

Saint-Louis, the French food and paper group, has begun negotiations to
double its stake in General Azucarera, the Spanish sugar company, from the
present level of 10 per cent, according to Mr Bernard Dumon, chairman.
Mr Dumon has confirmed that Saint-Louis was in talks to buy the holding in
General Azucarera owned by Banco Central Hispanoamericano, the banking
group. If the deal goes through the French group would emerge with just over
20 per cent of General Azucarera, which has annualised sales of FFr1.5bn
(Dollars 279m).
The General Azucarera deal forms part of Saint-Louis's plans to expand its
activities over the next few years. The French group, which made net profits
of FFr717m on sales of FFr34.16bn in 1993, is already a force in the
European sugar market through its Generale Sucriere subsidiary and in paper
due to its interest in Arjo Wiggins Appleton. However, Mr Dumon said he
hoped to double Saint-Louis's annual sales over the next six years.
