FT  15 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Purchases bolster Robert Wiseman


   By DAVID BLACKWELL


Acquisitions have driven both operating profits and turnover sharply up in
the first half at Robert Wiseman Dairies, the Scottish liquid milk processor
and distributor floated in March.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to October 1 improved to Pounds 2.95m,
against Pounds 2.82m last time when there was an exceptional gain of Pounds
327,000 on a disposal. Operating profits were up 21 per cent at Pounds 3.02m
(Pounds 2.49m) on sales 71 per cent ahead at Pounds 49.4m (Pounds 28.9m).
Wiseman has concentrated on supplying liquid milk in cartons and plastic
bottles to supermarkets and shops. Like-for-like sales were 15 per cent
ahead as the consumer trend away from doorstep deliveries continued.
Mr Alan Wiseman, chairman, said the group had been 'through the pain barrier
of losing doorstep business', which now accounts for just 10 per cent of
turnover, and was confident about progress in the current half.
Earlier this year the group acquired two Scottish dairy companies, paying
Pounds 3.2m for Mackies in April and Pounds 8.1m for Kennerty Farm Dairies
in May. Mackies contributed Pounds 4m to turnover in the period, while
Kennerty contributed Pounds 12m.
Net margins fell from 8 per cent to 6.1 per cent, reflecting the lower
margins at Kennerty. Since the acquisition, Wiseman has made Pounds 4m of
disposals with a possible Pounds 2m more expected from the sale of an
Edinburgh site.
Capital expenditure this year is expected to be Pounds 9m, including Pounds
5m towards a new dairy in Manchester, as the group moves into the English
market.
Mid-way gearing was 45 per cent, a level the group is comfortable with. It
had Pounds 7.5m net cash immediately after flotation.
The interim dividend of 0.9p is payable from earnings of 3.24p per share.
The shares closed unchanged at 100p.
