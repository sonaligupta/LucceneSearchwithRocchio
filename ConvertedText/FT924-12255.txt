FT  21 OCT 92 / International Company News: Cray Research earnings tumble in
third quarter

CRAY Research, the US computer maker, reported a sharp decline in earnings
for the third quarter after last week announcing plans to reduce its
workforce and consolidate operations.
Net earnings for the quarter were Dollars 6.5m, or 25 cents per share, down
from Dollars 28.1m, or Dollars 1.05 per share, in the same period last year.
Revenues rose to Dollars 220.1m from Dollars 205.5m.
The restructuring programme announced last week will save the company
Dollars 50m in 1993, said Mr John Rollwagen, chairman and chief executive.
The cuts will 'increase our competitive strength and profitability, and help
counteract the economic pressures felt from flat revenue and reduced profit
margins,' he said.
A Dollars 40m restructuring charge will be taken in the fourth quarter
resulting in losses for the quarter and only marginal profitability for the
year, the company said.
Revenues for the first nine months of 1992 were Dollars 570.3m against
Dollars 545.9m for the first nine months of 1991. Net earnings were Dollars
11.7m , or 44 cents per share, against Dollars 53.4m, or Dollars 2, for the
year ago period.
