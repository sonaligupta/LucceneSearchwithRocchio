FT  29 APR 94 / Tyneside economic initiative delayed


   By CHRIS TIGHE


Uncertainty over whether Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder in
receivership, will be sold as a going concern is delaying the proposed
creation of an enterprise zone for the area, Chris Tighe writes.
A Tyneside zone 'in the event of substantial job losses' from Swan Hunter
was promised by Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, in the Commons last
May.
He promised the government would 'urgently' examine possible sites for a
zone, a device used to help regenerate local economies by means of tax
concessions, exemption from business rates and a simplified planning regime.
About 1,400 of Swans' workforce, then 2,500 strong, have since been made
redundant by receivers Price Waterhouse and more jobs will go next month.
The Department of the Environment said yesterday a decision on the zone's
proposed area was unlikely until it was known whether Swan Hunter would find
a buyer.
