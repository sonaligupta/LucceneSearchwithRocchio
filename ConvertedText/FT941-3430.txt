FT  16 MAR 94 / Mirror Group jumps back with Pounds 132m: Recovery of money
for plundered pension funds - Dividend to be resumed


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


Mirror Group Newspapers yesterday celebrated its independence from
administrators and the legacy of the late Robert Maxwell by announcing
higher than expected pre-tax profits of Pounds 131.9m.
The turnround from a loss of Pounds 88.7m in 1992 included net exceptional
gains of Pounds 58.1m, compared with charges of Pounds 121.2m. The group was
able to release provisions of Pounds 60.8m as more money was recovered for
plundered pension funds.
Sir Robert Clark, chairman, said 1993 had been 'a year of success and
transformation for Mirror Group Newspapers. Every aspect of the business has
come under scrutiny.'
Trading profits rose 19 per cent to Pounds 115.9m on turnover up 2 per cent
at Pounds 476.1m for the 53 weeks to January 2. Profits before tax and
exceptionals reached Pounds 73.8m, against Pounds 32.5m.
'We have more than doubled the profits at the same time as we have gained
our independence,' said Mr David Montgomery, chief executive. This week has
also seen MGN move its titles to new headquarters in Canary Wharf in
London's Docklands.
Later this week, possibly today, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, is expected to rule on the bid by a consortium which includes MGN
for Newspaper Publishing, owner of The Independent and Independent on
Sunday.
MGN said it planned to resume dividend payments this year. Earnings per
share, excluding exceptionals, rose from 5.8p to 15.1p.
Year-end net debt fell from Pounds 392m to Pounds 335m and the company said
it intended to renegotiate borrowing terms with its banks.
Savings included Pounds 16m in production and editorial, partly offset by
Pounds 7m in extra newsprint and promotional costs. Some 600 jobs were cut
last year, bringing the workforce down to 2,900. Another 200 jobs are still
to go.
Despite pressure on circulation, particularly on the Daily Mirror which
faces tough competition from the cut-price Sun, circulation revenue fell
only marginally from Pounds 301.9m to Pounds 298.8m and advertising revenue
rose from Pounds 154.2m to Pounds 169.1m.
Mr Montgomery estimated the cover price cuts at The Sun and The Times were
costing News International Pounds 1m a week.
Circulations of the three main MGN titles - the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror
and People - are all declining but they are holding on to market share.
Between September 1993 and February 1994, according to ABC figures, The
People lost 3.35 per cent to 1.99m. But three years ago the rate of decline
was 15 per cent. In the six months to February, the Sunday Mirror lost 3.79
per cent to 2.57m, while the Daily Mirror dropped 7.3 per cent to 2.52m.
MGN shares rose 7p to close at 197p yesterday.
