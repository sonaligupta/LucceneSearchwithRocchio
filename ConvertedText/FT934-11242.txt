FT  02 NOV 93 / Limit on bias case payouts to end


   By RICHARD DONKIN


THE GOVERNMENT is to abolish the Pounds 11,000 compensation ceiling on both
race and sex discrimination cases, it announced yesterday.
The decision to remove the ceiling in cases of sex discrimination was forced
on the Government by the European Court of Justice, which ruled in August
that Britian's statutory ceiling was unlawful.
The government has gone further than the EC law required in deciding also to
abolish the limits for racial discrimination, and for religious
discrimination in Northern Ireland.
Announcing the government's decision in reply to a parliamentary question
from Mr Iain Duncan-Smith, Tory MP for Chingford, Miss Ann Widdecombe, the
employment minister, said: 'The government believes that all types of
unlawful discrimination should be liable to the same penalties.'
Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, said he hoped that regulations to
abolish the compensation ceiling for sex discrimination cases would come
into force later this month.
Amending the penalties for other forms of discrimination will take longer,
since it requires primary legis-lation.
The move has generated speculation that the government may have to concede
at some stage that the Pounds 11,000 limit on industrial tribunal cases of
unfair dismissal is no longer tenable.
Mr David Pannick QC, who has been examining the implications of the European
Court ruling, said there was nothing in EC law that barred an upper limit
for unfair dismissal claims.
However, he said 'There is a strong argument that no rational distinction
can be drawn between unfair treatment of one sort and unfair treatment of
another. You should get compen-sation to fit the loss you suffered.'
