FT  15 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Stoddard warns of flood damage costs


   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent


Stoddard Sekers, the carpet maker, yesterday issued a profits warning as a
result of flood damage at one of its plants caused by last weekend's
rainfall, the heaviest recorded this century in the west of Scotland.
The shares fell 4p to 28p.
The plant in Kilmarnock, Ayrshire, was not insured against flood damage
after a professional risk assessment concluded in 1992 that such risk was
low. Defences at the plant had been improved after a severe flood in 1961.
Stoddard Sekers said its preliminary estimate was that the exceptional cost
relating to the uninsured element of stock and lost production was not
likely to exceed Pounds 1.5m. In 1993 it made pre-tax profits of Pounds
2.14m. Analysts had been expecting pre-tax profits of about Pounds 2.5m in
1994.
The BMK plant, which weaves material for Axminster carpets for the group's
contract carpet market, was flooded to a depth of 4ft on the night of
December 10 when the Annick Water overflowed its banks. The defences
installed after the 1961 flood were left 2ft below the high water level.
Stoddard Sekers said last month that the contract carpet order book was
healthy. Mr Ralph Ellis, chief executive, said yesterday that the
Kil-marnock plant would be fully operational by the end of February.
