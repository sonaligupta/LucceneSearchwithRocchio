FT  16 MAR 94 / Cut feared in plans for road building


   By ANDREW TAYLOR


Civil engineering and building materials companies are increasingly worried
that higher-than-expected construction costs will persuade the government to
make substantial cuts in the road-building programme, Andrew Taylor writes.
Ministers are expected to announce reductions in construction plans after a
review of the 10-year national road programme, which is worth Pounds 23bn.
Contractors fear cuts may be deeper than expected because of rising costs.
Many contracts won at low prices during the recession have turned out to be
much more expensive, with costs up to 40 per cent higher than the tender
price according to some contractors. Claims for additional payments to cover
changes in specification or unexpected ground conditions have allowed
contractors to recover some of the margin they may have lost by bidding a
low price.
Tender prices for new work have also stopped falling and may even have risen
slightly.
In the Budget Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, had indicated that lower
construction prices caused by the recession would protect building plans.
