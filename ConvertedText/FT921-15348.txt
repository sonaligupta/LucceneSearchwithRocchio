FT  10 JAN 92 / Housing starts offer flicker of hope to building industry


   By ANDREW BAXTER


THE government yesterday welcomed statistics showing a small rise in housing
starts in November as evidence that the housebuilding industry is beginning
to recover.
According to provisional figures November housing starts were 12,500,
compared with 11,900 in the same mopnth a year before. This helped lift
housing starts during September-November last year to 40,600, 7 per cent
higher than the same period in the previous year.
Mr Tim Yeo, environment minister, said the figures provided 'clear evidence'
that housebuilding starts were recovering from 1990's levels.
He said: 'Starts in the second half of 1991 are running significantly ahead
of the same period in 1990 in both the private enterprise and housing
association sectors.'
The housebuilding industry, however, is likely to require much more evidence
before pronouncing the end of the housing recession.
In spite of the rise in November, starts in September-November were still
down 2 per cent from the previous three months. Private enterprise starts
fell 5 per cent while housing association starts rose. Overall, starts edged
up during the summer but later slipped back.
Yesterday the Building Employers' Confederation said the 'jury was still
out' on prospects for housing starts, and it was not expecting a sustained
rise until spring.
Housing starts are gen-erally seen as a leading indicator of activity in the
economy. They tend to precede house price rises by as much as a year.
