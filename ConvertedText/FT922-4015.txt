FT  08 JUN 92 / Tribune Group attempts revival


   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent


THE TRIBUNE GROUP, once a vigorous power base of Labour's parliamentary left
wing, is attempting to rejuvenate its radical traditions and so shake off
its recent reputation for passive acquiescence to the party leadership.
For some time, the group's meetings have been poorly attended, giving it
little influence on the party leadership. Now, after the election of Ms
Clare Short, MP for Birmingham Ladywood, as chairman, and Mr Peter Hain, MP
for Neath, as secretary, an effort is under way to revive the group 'as a
centre of renewal' and radical thinking.
In a circular to supporters at the weekend, Ms Short proposed that the group
should take Labour's general election defeat as an opportunity to remodel
Tribune as a lively forum for debate.
She writes: 'After previous election defeats, there has usually been some
shared analysis on the left as to why the defeat took place and what needed
to be done to take the party forward. On this occasion, there is no agreed
answer to these questions. This suggests a need for a period of open, well
informed and tolerant debate, rather than a need to organise for one
grouping or faction to seek to take control of the party.'
Her circular praises the party's organisational achievements but criticises
its over-reliance on 'polling and glitz', and its economic policy as 'deeply
cautious'.
Mr Bryan Gould last night urged Labour to adopt a radical anti-racist
programme. His call came in a policy document issued as part of his campaign
for the party leadership. He said: 'We must not shy away from our duty to
put forward a radical anti-racist programme, make clear our commitment to
equal opportunities, and put our own house in order.'
