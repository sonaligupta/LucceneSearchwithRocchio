FT  12 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong rises 2.4 per
cent to new high

   TOKYO


TRADING remained dull on the lack of fresh news, and the Nikkei average lost
ground on arbitrage-related selling, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei closed 118.96 off at 16,318.15 after a day's high of 16,481.95
and low of 16,279.74. It firmed in the morning on a rise in the futures
market, but was later weighed down by margin-unwinding and selling by
investment trusts.
Volume dipped to 190m shares from 216m. Declines outnumbered advances by 633
to 259, with 171 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section
stocks shed 6.73 to 1,248.33, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased
1.48 to 1,005.98.
Analysts said the Nikkei could fall further, as investors who bought shares
in the September rally were now selling. 'There is a clean-up of arbitrage
and margin positions built up in September,' said Mr Craig Chudler,
strategist at UBS Phillips & Drew.
Traders said most participants expect the index to fall below 16,000, which
would prompt buying by investors and public funds. However, buyers are
likely to be either short-term players or long-term investors. 'What we need
are investors who are in-between,' said one trader.
Banks were bought by public funds in the morning but later declined on
profit-taking. Industrial Bank of Japan lost Y20 at Y2,390 and Fuji Bank Y30
at Y1,760.
Kurabo Industries, the cotton spinner, was the most active issue of the day,
rising Y25 to Y365 on reports that it will start selling a popular synthetic
fibre.
Aids-related stocks were lower as dealers and speculators liquidated margin
positions. Investors were still discouraged by the recent 'TSD shock' when
the computer software company TSD, listed on the over-the-counter market,
last week admitted misinforming investors of clinical trials of its HIV
vaccine. Green Cross fell Y70 to Y1,260 and Okamoto Industries, the condom
maker, lost Y29 to Y956.
Gajoen Kanko, a hotel chain with close ties to Itoman, the scandal-tainted
textile trading company based in Osaka, was the weakest spot of the day,
dropping Y14 to Y120. Reports that Itoman, which is due to be dissolved by a
merger next year, had sold the bulk of its 13.9 per cent stake in Gajoen
prompted light selling.
In Osaka, the OSE average was 60.19 lower at 17,832.24 in volume of 23.3m
shares. Profit-taking depressed pharmaceutical and construction issues.
Roundup
THE SPORTING instincts of the Hong Kong investor stood out as the Pacific
Rim region put on a mixed performance.
HONG KONG's Hang Seng index closed 148.95, or 2.4 per cent, higher at a new
peak of 6,422.03 in heavy turnover of HKDollars 4.77bn, partly on news that
Governor Chris Patten had met China's top official in Hong Kong, but also on
the chance that the Legislative Council would reject Mr Patten's scheme for
wider democracy.
It was thought that rejection of Mr Patten's scheme - which would appease
Chinese anger over what Beijing sees as a challenge to its sovereignty after
Hong Kong's 1997 handover from Britain - could send the market to even
greater highs.
Tuesday's award of an estimated HKDollars 10bn container port contract to
several local consortia lifted Li Ka-shing's Hutchison empire, a unit of
which will share in the contract. Hutchison Whampoa was up HKDollars 1.10 at
HKDollars 17.10.
SINGAPORE saw late profit-taking as volume fell from 275.1m to a still
active 176.3m shares, and the Straits Times Industrial index ended just 3.72
higher at 1,441.86.
BANGKOK's banks led a strong technical rebound. Following reassurance on
market prospects by Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda, the finance minister, they
boosted the SET index to a rise of 10.60 to 937.12 in Bt10.64bn turnover.
Siam City Bank gained Bt1.50 at Bt17.75 on Bt1.41bn turnover.
SEOUL retreated on profit-taking after a five-day rally, the composite index
losing 17.90, or 2.6 per cent, to 658.96. Volume was again a record,
reaching 74.65m shares after Tuesday's 71.28m. Daewoo Corp attained the
highest ever day's turnover for a single company as it rose Won200 to
Won11,200 on 5.58m shares.
AUSTRALIA fell on a report that the country's debt rating was under
pressure. Moody's Investor Services said later that there was no immediate
threat to the debt rating, and the All Ordinaries index closed only 3.1 off
at 1,394.5.
BOMBAY dropped on reports of more payment defaults at other Indian bourses.
The BSE index touched 2,555.53 before finishing at 2,596.53, down 88.56 or
3.3 per cent. Brokers said the Ahmedabad bourse was hit by a payment crisis,
following defaults in Calcutta last week.
