FT  20 APR 91 / Briefcase, Q&A: Fare's unfair on the way to Faro


LAST YEAR I booked a flight to Faro with TAP Air Portugal. Business forced
me to delay departure but not the return. I did not receive any compensation
for the ticket and was charged a further Pounds 150. This year I booked
again with TAP and the dates were confirmed. To my annoyance and
astonishment, I was told that our flights could not take place on those
dates and they would have to be changed. Can it be fair that an airline can
switch without compensation but when an individual requests a switch he
loses all the money he has paid? Our travel agent suggested that to
compensate us we be upgraded. This was refused.
No, it is not fair, and you can claim compensation if you are not able to
book with some other carrier for the dates you require (in which case you
could require a refund on the tickets which you booked). It may be difficult
to establish a financial loss - other than the cost of telephoning to
re-book accommodation, if you were given sufficient warning of the change in
dates.

soon as possible.
