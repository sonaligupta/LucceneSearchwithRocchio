FT  12 MAR 93 / Technology: Computers on a learning curve - Worth Watching


   By ANDREW FISHER


Computers cannot think for themselves but they can learn, writes Andrew
Fisher. They can be trained to recognise patterns in data and act
accordingly.
Britain's Department of Trade and Industry is spending Pounds 6m on a
programme to raise the profile of neural computing among UK companies. The
money will finance an awareness programme managed by Touche Ross and support
six user clubs which will demonstrate applications such as financial
forecasting and industrial plant monitoring. DTI: UK, 071 353 1086.
