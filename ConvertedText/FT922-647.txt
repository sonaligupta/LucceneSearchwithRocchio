FT  26 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: British Columbia tries to end
pulp strike


   By ROBERT GIBBENS

BRITISH COLUMBIA is trying to restart negotiations to end a damaging
two-week-old pulp and paper industry strike.
Mr Moe Sihota, the labour minister asked the government mediator to try to
get the employers and two unions back to the table by the weekend, urging
both sides to display flexibility.
However the initial reaction from the employers was sceptical. 'Our
circumstances have not changed and doling out money is not in the cards,'
said Forest Industrial Relations, their bargaining agent.
The strike began June 15 after the Canadian Paperworkers' Union and the
Pulp, Paper & Woodworkers overwhelmingly refused an industry offer of
CDollars 1 (45p) an hour over two years and modest gains in fringe benefits.
The unions last year accepted a 10-month extension of the old contract
because of the industry's heavy losses - well over CDollars 500m in British
Columbia in 1991.
The strike by 13,000 workers has halted 19 pulp and paper mills throughout
British Columbia. Timber prices have moved up and softwood pulp producers
east of the Rockies are seeking a price rise of USDollars 40 a tonne to
USDollars 600 to take effect from July 1.
North American softwood pulp stocks are relatively tight, but newsprint
stocks are sufficient for more than 40 days and there is spare capacity
especially in eastern Canada.
British Columbia accounts for 12 per cent of North American capacity and 18
per cent of combined North American and Scandinavian northern softwood pulp
capacity.
