FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Turnround takes ERF to Pounds 0.8m


   By JOHN GRIFFITHS


Recovery in the UK truck market and some non-European export markets helped
produce a pre-tax profit of Pounds 801,000 at ERF (Holdings) in the six
months to October 1, against a Pounds 613,000 loss in the comparable period.
The turnround follows accumulated losses of more than Pounds 9m in the
previous four years, when ERF and all other truck makers suffered from the
most severe European market slump on record.
In the second half of last year ERF made Pounds 453,000 - not enough to
prevent a loss of Pounds 26,000 for the year as a whole.
In the current half-year gearing fell to 41.9 per cent, against 63.5 per
cent at the end of the previous year.
Turnover rose 37 per cent to Pounds 91.8m (Pounds 66.9m).
An interim dividend of 2p (nil) is payable from earnings per share of 4.6p
(7.53p loss).
UK sales were 25 per cent higher, but those to export markets, particularly
South Africa, jumped by 95 per cent. ERF's 43.9 per cent stake in ERF South
Africa earned it Pounds 109,000 (Pounds 78,000).
Mr Peter Foden, chairman, said he regarded South Africa as a major potential
growth area.
