FT  15 APR 94 / Balladur survives censure move


   By DAVID BUCHAN


   PARIS


French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur (left) yesterday easily escaped
censure of his government's employment policy on a motion tabled by the
Socialist and Communist opposition that gained 87 votes, far short of the
289 needed for it to pass. But the prime minister was warned by his
supporters that a better dialogue within his own party would have saved him
from some recent mistakes. At a separate Gaullist party meeting, the leader,
Mr Jacques Chirac, told Mr Balladur: 'Don't be alarmed, dear Edouard, at the
suggestions made by members of your majority. They are only made out of a
desire to succeed together.'
