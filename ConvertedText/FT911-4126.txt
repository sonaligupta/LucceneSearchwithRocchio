FT  20 APR 91 / Electricity unions warn of action


   By DIANE SUMMERS


ELECTRICITY supply unions warned last night that an overtime ban would start
next week if employers failed to increase an 8 per cent pay offer at talks
on Tuesday, writes Diane Summers.
The five unions involved, covering 70,000 power workers, have already
balloted in favour of an all-out strike if negotiations and action short of
a strike fail to win an improved offer.
