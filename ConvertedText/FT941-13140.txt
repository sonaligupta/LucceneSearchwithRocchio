FT  27 JAN 94 / Call to reform capital gains tax


The government should substantially reform capital gains tax, the Bow Group
says in a pamphlet published yesterday.
The tax is damaging to investment and enterprise, complicated and expensive
to administer and inefficient in raising funds, the Conservative pressure
group says.
The pamphlet was written by Mr Anthony Coombs, MP for Wyre Forest and
secretary of the Conservative parliamentary finance committee. He says the
decision in 1988 of Mr Nigel Lawson, the then chancellor, to equalise
capital gains tax and higher income tax rates left British capital taxes at
among the highest in the industrialised world.
