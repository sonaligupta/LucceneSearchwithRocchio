FT  15 APR 94 / Gartmore House


   By VANESSA HOULDER


Gartmore House, a 23,000 sq ft office block near the Monument owned by the
London Pension Funds Authority, is being sold to a UK institution for about
Pounds 10m, Vanessa Houlder writes.
The deal reflects the strength of demand for good quality property, which
has pushed City property yields - the ratio of income to capital  - down to
the lowest levels for several years.
Gartmore House, which is occupied by Gartmore Investment Management and Bass
Holdings, is being sold at a yield of below 6.5 per cent.
In a separate deal, Baltic House, a 53,000 sq ft building in Leadenhall
Street, has been sold to AMP Asset Management for Pounds 20m, on a yield of
6.75 per cent. The building, which is let to tenants including the First
National Bank of Chicago, was sold by a private Dutch company which bought
the building 11 months ago for Pounds 13.8m.
The deals reflect strong demand for good quality property, which is expected
to command rising rents.
By contrast, there has been a marked drop in demand for buildings with poor
rental prospects. Agents estimate that more than Pounds 500m of this type of
property is on the market.
However, the top prices being paid for City buildings are about half those
at the peak of the market in 1989, when deals were struck at prices of
Pounds 1,200 per sq ft.
