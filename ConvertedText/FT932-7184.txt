FT  25 MAY 93 / UK Company News: British Gas may build plant in Indonesia


   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES


British Gas is considering the construction of a Dollars 260m power plant in
Indonesia. The Indonesian government gave the company the go-ahead yesterday
to complete a full feasibility study on the project which would involve the
construction of a 400 MegaWatt gas-fired power station at Serpong in west
Java.
British Gas is currently discussing the project with a number of partners,
but the company stressed it had made no firm decision on its own
involvement.
The project is understood to involve a power station that would be completed
by 1996 and feed into the Indonesian electricity grid. It would be operated
by British Gas and handed over to the Indonesian government 30 years after
start-up.
British Gas is involved in two other projects in Indonesia. It is acting as
technical consultant to Perum Gas Negara, the state gas company, providing
technological and management support for the expansion of the gas
distribution network in Jakarta.
