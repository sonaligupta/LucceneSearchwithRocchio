FT  12 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: BTR


Mr Norman Ireland will enjoy only three years at the helm of BTR before the
company's compulsory retirement age of 68 forces him to move on. But his is
an experienced and safe pair of hands and BTR should have a fair wind behind
it when he climbs back aboard in the summer. It would be unfair to dwell on
BTR's draw-down on just over Pounds 300m in acquisition provisions last
year, which was rather more than Hanson. Its figures also show a healthy
cash inflow. It was easily able to afford the Pounds 235m outlay on
restructuring Hawker Siddeley.
There should be further efficiency gains this year, while profits will be
helped by exchange rate movements even if volume growth remains modest.
Gearing should drop quite rapidly as the year wears on, giving BTR
considerable acquisition fire-power just as it completes the integration of
Hawker. Even now its strong share price would give it some flexibility to
finance a purchase with paper.
Mr Ireland's arrival does little to change the outlook. For the next three
years BTR will presumably carry on in very much its traditional style. But
it looks less likely now that Mr Alan Jackson will eventually step up to
fill the chairman's slot. In three years' time BTR will again be looking for
a new chairman. The long-term succession uncertainty has only been deferred.
