FT  21 NOV 92 / Letter: Touchable and untouchable


   From PARVIZ DABIR-ALAI


Sir, Tony Jackson finds it 'increasingly difficult to unscramble' the output
of services from those of manufacturing ('The incredible shrinking
industrial base', November 16). I offer him a simple rule: if you can touch
it then it is almost certainly manufactured; if you cannot, it is a service.
This works with all of his examples: financial services provided by General
Motors and by the City of London, GM's cars, the City of London's need for
computers etc. On the more substantive point that services cannot replace
manufacturing, well, that argument is untouchable.
