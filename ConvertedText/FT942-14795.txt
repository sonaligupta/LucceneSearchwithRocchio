FT  19 APR 94 / Curry's guilty of race bias


A black salesman for electrical retailers Curry's, sacked after swearing at
a company race equality executive he mistook for a waitress, was a victim of
racial discrimination, an industrial tribunal ruled today.
Tribunal chairman Ms Barbara Calvert QC said Mr Dion Deleon would not have
been dismissed for gross misconduct if he had been white.
She said part of the reason for his sacking was his rowdy behaviour, but
noisy white employees with him were not even given a warning.
Company claims that his rowdy behaviour had brought them into disrepute,
because he was wearing a tie with 'Curry's' written on it, had not been
proved.
