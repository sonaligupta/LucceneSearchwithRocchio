FT  29 APR 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Building a better mousetrap


   By ANDREW FISHER


For buildings infested with small rodents, a UK company has developed a
high-tech mouse trap. Mouse Alert uses infra-red detectors and low-power
radio signals to warn customers when a mouse has been caught.
Developed by Radio Data Systems for Rentokil, it comprises a number of
trapping boxes placed around the building, and a wall-mounted control
console. Instead of traps having to be checked regularly, the detectors on
each trap transmit a signal to the console.
Mouse Alert can also be put in unstaffed areas such as automated
distribution centres and storage and production sites.
