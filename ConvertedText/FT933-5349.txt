FT  03 SEP 93 / International Company News: Germany plans defence sale to US

THE German government will sell a 45 per cent stake in a Bavarian-based
defence group to Bradduck Dunn McDonald of the US for an undisclosed sum.
The government will sell its stake in Industrieanlagen-Betriebsgesellschaft
(IABG), 98 per cent owned subsidiary of the Industrieverwaltungsgesellschaft
(IVG), a company holding properties and land. IVG is 50 per cent owned by
the government.
The government said the IABG sale was part of its newly announced plan to
sell state-owned companies.
IABG, which has a turnover of DM324m (Dollars 195.1m) and employs 1,500
people, is active in manufacturing software and logistics systems used by
the German defence ministry. It is also involved in running one of the three
testing centres of the European Space Agency, according to the finance
ministry in Bonn.
The federal ministry for research and development will retain an option to
take over the activities of IABG in the testing centre through a subsidiary
of the German Institute for Aerospatial Research, created for this purpose.
IABG reported profits in 1992 after three consecutive years of losses, due
to fewer contracts in the defence sector. Turnover last year rose by 13 per
cent.
The government said it would keep a 15 per cent stake in IABG and the rest,
excluding the US group's holding, is expected to be placed with German
companies.
