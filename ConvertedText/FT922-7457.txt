FT  19 MAY 92 / Germany's DAX index climbs 2%

The DAX index of 30 leading German shares closed just under 2 per cent
higher yesterday, up 34.6 points to close at 1758.43.
The increase reflected a positive response to the news of a settlement: the
market had been expecting a strike and was surprised at the last-minute turn
of events.
Much of the buying came from traders attempting to square their 'short
positions' and there was no wave of purchases from institutional investors.
Brokers suggested this may come in the next few days as investors pondered
the details of the deal.
'It was a lot better than it could have been,' said Mr Gunter Kirchhain of
Deutsche Bank's Dusseldorf-based institutional equities team. 'It suggests
that the much-heralded German disease may have turned out to be no more than
a virus infection after all.'
Mr Hans-Peter Hodniock of James Capel in Frankfurt was emphatic that the
settlement removed the threat of a 'wage-price spiral' in Germany. He was
hopeful that the Bundesbank would look on it in the same light and be moved
to consider relaxing its tight monetary policy.
The Bundesbank itself took a relatively sanguine view of the lifting of the
strike threat. Mr Otmar Issing, the Bundesbank directorate member
responsible for economics, said in London that the deal was 'a step in the
right direction'. Even though wage levels were still rising by more than the
country could afford, Mr Issing pointed out that a settlement in the region
of 5.5 per cent was in line with mainstream economic forecasts for wage
rises at the beginning of the year.
