FT  02 JUL 92 / The Future of the European Fighter: Casa says alternative
fighter not acceptable


   By TOM BURNS


   MADRID


CASA, Spain's state-owned aerospace company and the junior partner in the
EFA project, reacted angrily to Germany's decision to pull out from the
four-nation programme, saying any alternative fighter would not meet the
requirements of the Spanish air force.
A smaller aircraft, as proposed by Germany, would incur additional
development costs and would introduce estimated delays of between five and
eight years, Casa said.
It added that the consequences of such delays would be serious for the air
force and crippling for domestic industries.
Casa has a 13 per cent participation in the EFA project, while the Spanish
air force is due to acquire 87 Eurofighter units.
Casa said in a statement that it was 'firmly convinced' that the three
remaining partners in the project - British Aerospace and Itay's Alenia as
well as Casa - could take on EFA together and 'keep within the budget levels
identified for the four-nation programme'.
The acute disappointment expressed by Casa over the German position and the
company's bullish intention to push ahead without the Germans reflect the
enormous investment already made by Spain in the project and the hopes
placed in the programme by domestic industry.
Casa said Spain had already invested Pta70bn (Pounds 380m) out of a total
Pta125bn in the development phase of the Eurofighter and the production of
the aircraft could earn Pta31bn a year over 16 years for Spanish industry.
A total of 18 Spanish companies have been involved in the EFA's development
phase, employing some 2,000 highly specialised engineers.
The production of the Eurofighter would generate a total of 22,000 domestic
jobs and 50m working hours for the domestic aerospace industry.
