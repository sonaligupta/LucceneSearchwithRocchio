BANCO Comercial Portugues (BCP), one of Portugal's biggest retail banks,
yesterday announced a 9 per cent increase in consolidated net profits in
1993 to Es22.6bn (Dollars 128m), despite the depressed economic conditions
and falling financial margins.
The increase represents a 2 per cent rise in profits per share to Es205.6.
BCP leads the Portuguese share market, with a market capitalisation of
Es292bn at end-1993 and a bigger price rise than any other share.
Total assets grew 27 per cent to Es1,927bn. Credit extended to clients rose
28 per cent to Es807bn but remained stationary as a proportion of total
assets at 41 per cent.
Cash flow rose 34 per cent to Es75bn. The contribution of subsidiary
companies to the consolidated profits rose 24 per cent to Es3.9bn, 17 per
cent of the total, benefiting from cross-selling and the promotion of new
products in Portugal, Spain and France.
BCP more than doubled its provisions against non-performing loans to
Es13.4bn.
