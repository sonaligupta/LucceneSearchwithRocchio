FT  28 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Hopes fade for big swing to SNP


   By JAMES BUXTON


IN SCOTLAND the signs are that Labour is consolidating its traditional
position as the leading party and that the Scottish National party is not
making the big breakthrough it had hoped for, James Buxton writes.
The Tories are static and support for the Liberal Democrats appears to be
falling to dangerously low levels.
Opinion polls suggest that Labour has the support of at least 42 per cent of
the Scottish electorate. A System Three poll for The Herald newspaper,
published yesterday, showed Labour on 44 per cent, a rise of 6 points since
February.
The same poll, taken between March 19 and 24, showed a 2-point drop in
support for the SNP to 26 per cent, a level roughly consistent with other
polls.
Two polls this week put the Tories on 22 per cent, while System Three put
support for the Liberal Democrats down 2 points at only 7 per cent. Other
polls have put them on 9 per cent.
That means Labour might win 50 of the 72 Scottish seats, as it did in 1987.
Backing for the SNP is running at twice its 1987 level, but majorities in
Labour-held seats are mostly so large that the nationalists stand little
chance of taking more than one or two seats from it.
The outcome in terms of seats for the SNP, the Tories and the Liberal
Democrats depends on the shift of relatively few votes among four parties in
marginal seats.
Nevertheless, broadly speaking, the SNP stands to gain a few seats (it has
five, although one came through a defection from Labour), the Tories to lose
a few (they have nine) and the Liberal Democrats to lose some (they have
10).
The Conservatives and the SNP are campaigning mainly on the constitutional
issue, with the Tories upholding the status quo and the nationalists
proclaiming independence.
