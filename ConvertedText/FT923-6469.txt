FT  24 AUG 92 / Foreign Exchanges and Money Markets: A dazzling D-Mark


   By JAMES BLITZ


The question now facing the world's central banks is how the dollar's fall
can can be stabilised, writes James Blitz.
Recent interventions show that the US authorities do not want to see the
dollar fall uncontrollably, if at all. There is a negative impact on equity
markets: the Dow Jones Index fell by over 50 points on Friday. The dollar's
fall also increases strains in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism as
traders sell dollars for D-Marks, pushing up the German currency's value.
Many dealers believe that the Fed is planning more rounds of intervention,
in the hope of turning the market once-and-for-all. With the dollar testing
DM1.42, it must be easier to convince the market into thinking that there
are profits to be made.
But can intervention work ? The fundamental problem weighing the currency
down is that the US, Germany and Japan are pursuing domestically-oriented
policies which put less emphasis than usual on exchange rates.
That dysfunction has widened the differential between US and German
short-term rates so far that the markets are dazzled by the D-Mark's
investment potential. It has undermined the credibility of concerted
intervention, too. By buying dollars, the Bundesbank puts D-Marks into
circulation and founders its attempt to control the M3 monetary supply
target.
Arguably, the only factors which will underpin the dollar are an improved
outlook for the US economy or a cut in German interest rates. Analysts see
no sign of the former, but Germany's slide into recession may bring a rate
cut by the end of this year. Until then, central banks may pay heavily in
reserves to stabilise the currency system.
