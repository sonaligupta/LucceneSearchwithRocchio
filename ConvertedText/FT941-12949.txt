FT  27 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Strong Roche advance takes
Zurich to record


   By Our Markets Staff


Apart from a downturn among the emerging markets, bourses were generally
firmer, writes Our Markets Staff, improving on good economic news in Germany
and seemingly impervious to a general strike threat in Spain.
ZURICH posted a second consecutive record close, as the market again took
its lead from the strong performance of Roche. The SMI index rose 24.8 to
3,091.3.
Roche certificates rose SFr145 or 2.1 per cent to SFr6,945 on short covering
by foreign and domestic investors. The share has risen by a cumulative 3.8
per cent over the last two days, amid renewed speculation that the company
is planning a share split.
In chemicals, Ciba-Geigy bearers fell SFr5 to SFr940 after reports that a
German regional environment minister had called on the group to bear the
cost of cleaning up northern German beaches after packets of one of its
pesticides were washed ashore.
FRANKFURT was cheered by further good news on inflation from the states of
Bavaria and Hesse and retrieved most of Tuesday's post-bourse losses, the
Dax index closing just 7.61 lower on the session at 2,119.17.
The afternoon saw the Ibis-indicated Dax stage an eventual recovery to
2,128.66 after a period of weakness but Mr Thomas Nolten, of B Metzler in
Frankfurt, saw no message for investors in this. 'For several days,' he
said, 'equities have simply followed movements on the bund market.'
Influenced additionally by the movement of Dax futures, the market was
currently a traders' preserve, said Mr Nolten, with investors on the
sidelines awaiting German M3 figures. Inflated by special factors, M3 could
rise by 7 1/2 to 8 per cent for December.
Turnover fell from DM10.2bn to DM9.1bn. Lufthansa, which dropped DM9.50 last
Friday on profit-taking, put it back on again to close at DM189 yesterday
with dealers powerless to explain the airline's gains. Mr Nolten saw buyers
around for the retailer, Asko, but no stories to explain why the stock was
up DM40 to DM1,265 yesterday, and by DM155, or 14 per cent over the past
three days.
PARIS closed the day slightly firmer with even Bouygues, the construction
group, adding FFr4 to FFr735 in spite of reporting disappointing results.
The CAC-40 index rose 4.01 to 2,282.35.
Bouygues turned in its estimated results for 1993 after the close on
Tuesday, showing a steeper decline then had been expected, owing to losses
in its property division. Elsewhere in the sector Lafarge Coppee, up FFr5.30
to FFr474.00, said that it would not release its results until mid-March,
but would make a comment on trading activity at a meeting today.
Moulinex, which is not included in the CAC-40, performed well after
announcing that it hoped to break even in the nine months to the end of
December. The shares gained FFr9 to FFr128.
MILAN picked up after a weak start, prompted by renewed political worries,
as US investors returned as buyers later in the day. The Comit index rose
2.36 to 627.57.
Turnover remained high, in spite of a two hour failure of the electronic
trading system, after Tuesday's all time record L895bn, which compared with
average daily turnover of a mere L50bn during the summer of 1992.
Demand centred on the banks after BCI reported on Tuesday that parent
company profits rose 1.7 per cent in 1993, in spite of big increases in tax
payments and bad loan provisions. BCI rose L171 or 3.6 per cent to L4,890
and Credito Italiano added L107 or 4.9 per cent to L2,306.
Among smaller stocks attracting renewed attention, Alitalia was L48.60 or 6
per cent higher at L846.30 after the weekend management changes and
indications that a more dynamic future is planned.
MADRID balanced an ongoing rally in bank stocks against the threat posed by
today's general strike, coming out strongly on the credit side with the
general index 5.46 higher at a new high of 348.40.
Turnover was virtually unchanged, a high Pta50.8bn. In banks, BBV rose by
another Pta225 to Pta3,325 and Popular by Pta480 to Pta16,780.
AMSTERDAM softened slightly, the AEX index down 0.67 to 425.62, given
weakness in the blue chips, such as Royal Dutch, off Fl 1.00 at Fl 210.80.
The AEX index eased 0.67 to 425.62.
ING went in the opposite direction, rising Fl 1.20 to Fl 87.30, on news that
it might be close to the sale of its UK insurance unit, Victory.
ISTANBUL dropped another 7 per cent, the composite index falling 1,598.57 to
21,128.64 as interbank overnight rates remained at 190 per cent, and the
central bank twice sold dollars to try to reverse the fall of the lire.
Incorporating rapid currency depreciation, the index has lost 35 per cent in
dollar terms over the past 13 days.
ATHENS was unmoved by new interest rate cuts, tumbling 2.6 per cent
profit-taking. The general index closed 29.48 lower at 1,114.01.
