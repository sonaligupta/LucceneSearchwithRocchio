FT  22 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Boots upset Airways alert


   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO


A disappointing agm statement, together with a large technical sell
programme, sent drugs and retail outfit Boots tumbling. The stock later
rallied, but still finished a busy session 13 1/2 down at 522p, having
touched 511p at one stage. Turnover was a weighty 8.1m, the highest this
year.
Boots' first-quarter high street retail sales came in below market
expectations, as did a 5.6 per cent decline at Do It All, the home
improvement business. But it was the lack of news on the expected sale of
the group's drugs division which caused most disappointment among analysts,
who accelerated this week's trickle of downgrades in anticipation of the
event.
However, although specialists expect the sale - which is likely to fetch up
to Pounds 1bn - to be earnings dilutive, some believe this may be offset by
a Pounds 500m special dividend from the cash-rich company.
Boots' Do It All partner WH Smith slipped 7 to 473p, as stores analysts
predicted the need for a further cash injection for the troubled business.
B&Q owner Kingfisher, 18 weaker at one point yesterday, recovered to end the
day only a penny adrift at 501p after 4.6m traded.
Pharmaceuticals group Wellcome saw its share price marked down sharply as
dealers anticipated heavy profit-taking following the announcement of
interim figures restated to adjust to a calendar year-end.
The exceptional charge of Pounds 58m was slightly higher than anticipated
and sales of Retrovir, the anti-Aids treatment, were down 16 per cent as a
result of the findings of last year's Concorde trial. The company also
stamped firmly on recent takeover or merger speculation which had added
around 50p to the share price.
However, profits rose 12 per cent to Pounds 182m over four months and sales
of Zovirax, the herpes treatment and Wellcome's best-selling drug, rose 15
per cent over 10 months. The shares clawed their way back from being 17 down
to close 10 off at 605p.
News and electronic information group Reuters Holdings fell 9 to 467p in
spite of the stronger dollar, which would tend to support the shares of
internationally traded stocks. Bemusement increased when dealers noticed the
shares remained weak even after some large lines of stock were placed at
475p. It appeared that Goldman Sachs might have been selling actively via
the inter-dealer broker system. Turnover was unusually heavy at 8.2m shares.
The regional electricity companies (recs) were again prominent as investors'
appetites continued to be whetted in advance of the regulatory review
expected early next month. Eastern forged ahead 26 to 640p, East Midlands 16
to 623p, Midlands 19 to 640p, Manweb 20 to 713p and Yorkshire 24 1/2 to 626
1/2 p.
Mr Andrew Wheeler at NatWest Securities said he believed the recs still had
an upside of a further 10 per cent in the run-up to the review and beyond.
'The review will be harsh, but the companies will be able to cope with that.
We are still predicting 6 per cent real dividend growth for the rest of the
decade.'
A second profits warning from Shoprite in as many months saw the shares lose
half their value to close at 30p.
Brewer and retailer Whitbread slid 9 to 543p. The company was said to be
denying foreign press reports that it was negotiating to buy Swiss company
Moevenpick, a restaurant and hotel group.
British Steel hardened 2 to 158 1/2 p with 11m shares traded as the market
appreciated news that the company is to raise its prices for strip and plate
products in September. British Aerospace benefited from a recommendation by
several brokers to switch from Rolls-Royce into BAe. The former gained 11 to
505p, while the latter held at 192 1/2 p.
Recommendations from Kleinwort Benson and BZW boosted conglomerate Tomkins 8
to 231p.
Biotechnology company Celltech jumped 18 to 209p on news that it will
collaborate with Merck, of the US, on asthma treatment.
Speciality chemicals group W. Canning gained 16 at 194p after the company
announced a Pounds 9.2m disposal.
