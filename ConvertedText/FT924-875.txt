FT  22 DEC 92 / Battle in Algerian town


   By REUTER


   ALGIERS


Algerian troops have fought a nine-hour battle with gunmen in a Moslem
fundamentalist stronghold near Algiers, the official news agency APS said
yesterday, Reuter reports from Algiers.
No casualty figures were immediately available but APS reported 'deaths and
wounded' in the operation in the town of Blida on Sunday night and said 'an
important armed group had reportedly been neutralised.'
The authorities have recently stepped up their battle to crush Islamic
fundamentalists, blamed for killing about 200 members of the security forces
since last February.
Last week, troops killed 13 fundamentalists in a sweep of mountains near
Algiers and in two eastern suburbs.
