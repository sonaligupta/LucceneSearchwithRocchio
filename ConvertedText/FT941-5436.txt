FT  07 MAR 94 / Building equipment sales show 42% rise


   By ANDREW BAXTER


Construction equipment sales rose 42 per cent last year after three years of
decline that left the market at its lowest level in living memory, according
to a report by Corporate Intelligence Group, the researchers.
The rise in sales, from 9,236 units in 1992 to 13,017, was nearly twice as
much as was predicted a year ago. It means the UK was the only major
European construction equipment market to rise last year.
The group predicts a further 11 per cent rise this year, but warns against
over-optimism: even if this forecast is fulfilled, sales will still only be
equivalent to those of 1986-1987, and many more companies are now fighting
for market share.
Much of the rise last year was generated in the last quarter, with
agriculture products and the plant hire industry showing the most growth.
The group says: 'Farmers benefited from the strength of the Green Pound, and
needed to replace equipment which was getting old.'
For plant hirers, fleets often dating back to the late 1980s needed
updating, interest rates were low, and there was little good secondhand
equipment available as most of it had been sold overseas.
Sales of mini-excavators rose by 50 per cent to 2,170 units. In the biggest
single product sector, backhoe loaders, sales rose 40 per cent to 3,452.
However, markets for larger equipment are still lacking in confidence, says
the report. This is because of continued uncertainty over the future of
opencast coal, and the minimal rise expected in construction spending, which
will keep activity in the extractive industries at a modest level.
A further rise in the market this year would still leave sales a long way
short of the 21,710 units sold in 1989. But most suppliers would be happy if
that level was never reached again, says the report, because overheated
demand creates as much confusion in the marketplace as no demand.
A realistic total volume of 16,500-17,500 units a year would be welcomed and
should be sustainable, it says.
