FT  12 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: SEC plans to relax small
business rules


   By ALAN FRIEDMAN


   NEW YORK


THE Securities and Exchange Commission voted yesterday to propose a new rule
that would ease registration rules for initial share offers from small
companies, writes Alan Friedman in New York.
The SEC proposal would expand an existing rule known as Regulation A, which
allows small businesses to use a simplified disclosure document for initial
share offers. The new proposal would allow companies to use this regulation
for offers of up to Dollars 5m, against a current level of Dollars 1.5m.
The proposal would also allow small companies to use simplified disclosure
forms when they file quarterly and year-end financial statements.
The vote to propose the relaxed rules for small companies followed a long
and contentious meeting, during which Mr Richard Breeden, SEC chairman,
objected to an alternative plan from Mr Edward Fleischman, a senior SEC
member. The Fleischman plan would have allowed small companies to file
semi-annual, instead of quarterly, reports.
Mr Breeden noted that the agency's Regulation A - designed to make share
offers easier for small companies - was 'hardly used by anybody'.
