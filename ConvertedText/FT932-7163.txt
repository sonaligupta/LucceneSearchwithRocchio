FT  25 MAY 93 / International Company News: Fermenta back in the black at
4-month stage

   STOCKHOLM


FERMENTA, the Swedish pharmaceuticals group, made a profit after financial
items of SKr8m (Dollars 1.1m) in the first four months, turning round a
SKr29m loss in the corresponding period of 1992.
The company attributed the improvement to lower interest costs and
favourable foreign currency movements.
It said it expected the full-year result to be considerably better than last
year, when it recorded a loss after financial items of SKr115m. Fermenta is
anticipating a positive operating result and even a positive overall result,
although currency and interest rate factors will not be as beneficial over
the rest of the year as in the first four months.
Turnover in the first four months amounted to SKr174m, up 25 per cent from
SKr139m last year.
The group said increased volumes and the stronger dollar contributed to the
rise, which amounted to 50 per cent when adjusted for comparable units. The
profit after extraordinary items was SKr8m, compared with a SKr49m loss last
year.
The group's financial position has strengthened markedly over the last year,
following a refocusing on its core pharmaceutical activities.
Interest-bearing debt amounted to SKr310m at the end of April, compared with
SKr1.72bn a year ago, and SKr734m at the end of last year.
