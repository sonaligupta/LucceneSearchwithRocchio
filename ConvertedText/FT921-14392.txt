FT  16 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Backing for Quebec copper plan


   By BERNARD SIMON

COMINCO AND Teck, the Vancouver-based mining groups, have thrown their
weight behind the Louvicourt copper, zinc and gold deposit in central Quebec
by shouldering a large chunk of the development costs and acquiring a 25 per
cent equity stake in the project.
The two companies will acquire their stake from Aur Resources, a junior
mining group, in return for a cash payment of CDollars 15m (Pounds 7.3m)
plus a contribution of 55 per cent of the next CDollars 100m in development
costs. The contribution also covers Aur's share of the costs. Aur will
retain a 30 per cent interest in the project.
The deal thus values Louvicourt, considered one of the most promising base
metal projects in Canada, at a total of CDollars 180m. Construction costs
are estimated at CDollars 326m.
The Louvicourt mill is due to start up in 1994 at a rate of 640,000 tonnes a
year. Full production of 1.8m tonnes is scheduled for 1997. Metal output at
full capacity is expected to reach 215m lb of copper, 53m lb of zinc, 36,000
ounces of gold and 960,000 ounces of silver.
Mr Raymond Goldie, analyst at Richardson Greenshields in Toronto, said
besides high grades and large tonnages, Louvicourt benefited from being
close to existing infrastructure, such as roads and power supplies. The
mine, near the town of Val d'Or, will also be close to a smelter operated by
Noranda, the Toronto-based resources group.
Because the deposit is adjacent to a mine that was closed in the mid-1970s,
Mr Goldie expects the environmental review process to proceed relatively
smoothly.
The remainder of the project will be financed by Louvem Mines, which has a
45 per cent equity interest. Louvem is 51 per cent owned by Noranda.
