FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Ransomes Pounds 8.9m into the red -
Restructuring costs and heavy interest charges behind deficit


   By TIM BURT


Ransomes, the manufacturer of grass-cutting equipment, yesterday reported
sharply increased losses as it struggled with the twin burdens of
large-scale restructuring and heavy debt.
The two factors led to pre-tax losses of Pounds 8.9m in the 12 months to
December 31, compared with a restated 1992 deficit of Pounds 600,000.
Mr John Clement, chairman, blamed the decline on a restructuring programme
involving a 12 per cent cut in the workforce, the removal of a tier of
senior management and the contraction of its operating divisions.
The programme led to a threefold increase in exceptional charges to Pounds
5.8m.
Operating profits, meanwhile, fell by 35 per cent to Pounds 5.3m amid
intense competition in the US and flat sales in Europe.
The figures were dented further by interest charges of Pounds 8.4m (Pounds
8.7m) on net borrowings of Pounds 75.3m (Pounds 76.1m), representing gearing
of 450 per cent.
Despite the problems, Mr Clement, who took over as chairman last October,
said its principal bankers had agreed to maintain existing borrowing
facilities of Pounds 120m.
They have also backed moves to reshape the group by Mr Peter Wilson,
appointed chief executive last autumn.
Mr Wilson initiated the redundancy programme, closed some overseas
facilities and reorganised group operations in two new divisions -
commercial and consumer.
Profits in the commercial operation fell sharply to Pounds 1.76m (Pounds
7.11m) following the group's failure to exploit market opportunities -
particularly among golf course operators. Its poor performance was offset by
increased demand in the consumer division, which saw operating profits
increase 25 per cent to Pounds 3.52m.
Group turnover rose slightly to Pounds 165.8m (Pounds 156.6m).
Losses per share worked through at 26.1p against a restated 11.5p.
The company, which omitted its interim dividend, is also passing the final
on both its ordinary and cumulative preference shares.
COMMENT
Ransomes is paying the price for its dash for growth in 1989 when it
acquired Cushman, the US grass machinery group, for Dollars 150m (Pounds
103m). Although, the new management has begun to tackle the debt burden left
by that purchase, it faces an uphill struggle. The pressure has been
increased by its decision to change the year end to September, leaving only
10 months to produce some positive results. Nevertheless, it claims to have
already stripped out Dollars 10m of costs in the US and Pounds 1.5m at home.
Analysts, who were unwilling to make profit forecasts, warned the group
would have to make operating gains of more than Pounds 5.7m just to pay its
dividend liability and generate earnings per share.
