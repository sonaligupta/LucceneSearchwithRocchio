FT  29 JAN 92 / International Company News: S&P cuts UTC debt rating


   By MARTIN DICKSON


STANDARD & Poors, the US credit agency, yesterday lowered its rating on
United Technologies' debt, citing the group's recent Dollars 1.5bn charge
for restructuring moves and environmental costs.
The agency cut its rating of UTC's senior debt from double-A-minus to
single-A-plus.
It said the charges reduced the near-term financial flexibility of the
aerospace and diversified manufacturing company and highlighted the
increasingly competitive nature of its core businesses.
