FT  28 MAR 92 / US extends its Libyan boycott list


   By AP


   WASHINGTON


THE US yesterday added 46 foreign companies to the list of those it regards
as agents of the Libyan government and bars from business with Americans, AP
reports from Washington.
'This action is part of ongoing Treasury efforts to tighten enforcement of
the US economic embargo against Libya,' the Treasury said.
The additions brought to 106 the number of companies on the US list of
'specially designated nationals' of the Libyan government. The list also
includes 20 individuals.
Most of the companies were based in Libya but the list also included some in
other North African countries, Italy, Britain, Germany, Spain, Switzerland
and Hungary, several with non-Libyan names.
Inclusion on the list brings the companies and individuals under the embargo
and asset freeze ordered against Libya by former President Reagan in 1986 to
undermine Libyan leader Muammer Gadaffi's ability to promote and finance
terrorism.
The announcement said the companies included key Libya-controlled
organisations in the international banking, petroleum, investment and
commercial industries.
