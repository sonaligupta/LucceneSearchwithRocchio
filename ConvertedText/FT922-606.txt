FT  26 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Canadians may object to softwood exports
ruling


   By REUTER and GEORGE GRAHAM


   WASHINGTON


THE US International Trade Commission (ITC) ruled yesterday that subsidised
softwood exports from Canada were injuring the US lumber industry, paving
the way for possible punitive duties, Reuter reports from Washington.
Canada has said it will appeal against an adverse decision. The US Commerce
Department had found Canadian provincial governments subsidised softwood by
some 6.5 per cent, the level of countervailing duties if the ITC's 4-2 vote
is upheld.
An appeal would go to a dispute panel under the US-Canada free trade pact.
The action follows Canada's removal of a 15 per cent export tax it had
imposed to offset the provincial subsidies as part of a 1987 US-Canada
softwood accord.
US car makers have suffered a setback in efforts to win dumping duties on
Japanese minivan imports, George Graham reports. The Commerce Department
ruled last month that Toyota, Mazda and other Japanese makers had sold
minivans in the US below production cost, but the ITC decided this week that
US makers had not been harmed by the imports.
