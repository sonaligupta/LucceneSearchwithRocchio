FT  13 APR 92 / Letter: Top executive pay schemes must be effective and
'transparent'


   From Mr KEVIN O'SULLIVAN


Sir, Your leader, 'How to pay top executives' (April 8), was timely and
important.
The key principle, as you say, must be to align directors' interests with
those of shareholders. A simple system is best. A basic salary paid at
market rates, supplemented by a bonus arithmetically related to earnings per
share (EPS) is effective, easily understood and 'transparent' (an important
quality). Bonuses of this kind should be generous where performance is good,
so that the EPS-related component will sometimes represent a large
proportion of a successful manager's earnings.
For smaller companies, a system of employee shareholding reaching down to
key people well below board level is an excellent motivator, either in
addition to, or instead of, such a scheme. Such a system, by requiring
directors and staff to pay for their shares, and thereby to take on the full
responsibilities of ownership, is far more conducive to responsible
management than an option scheme. A share option scheme is a one-way bet
(you can win, but you can't lose, and you stake nothing) which can encourage
people merely to 'have a punt on the firm' rather than to settle down to
build it.
