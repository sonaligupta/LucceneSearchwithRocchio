FT  20 APR 94 / Watchdog praises Treasury debt sales


   By TRACY CORRIGAN


The National Audit Office told parliament yesterday that the Treasury's sale
of debt in British Telecommunications and the privatised electricity
companies 'represented a great measure of success in a novel and complex
transaction'.
The Treasury raised Pounds 1.3bn in 1992 through a complex auction of its
remaining holdings of debt in privatised UK companies.
The public-spending watchdog recommended that, in future sales, the Treasury
should 'continue to explore the scope for further restructuring of the
remaining debt'. Only one restructuring of the debt - a conversion of BT
debt from domestic to Eurobond form - was undertaken last time. The watchdog
also recommended that investors should be allowed to bid for parts of
issues.
'We are clearly focused on these two aspects and are thinking through how we
can incorporate these features,' said Salomon Brothers, the US investment
bank appointed to advise the Treasury on the next debt sale. This is due to
take place later this fiscal year.
The government still holds a total of Pounds 2.86bn of debt - Pounds 1.22bn
of BT debt and Pounds 1.64bn of electricity company debt - which was left on
the companies' balance sheets at privatisation. However, some of that debt
is very short-dated and unlikely to be sold.
Although the watchdog was 'happy with almost everything', the Treasury was
criticised for assuming that BT's refinancing costs would be refinanced in
the sterling bond market, so that the continuing stream of tax deductions
allowable for interest payments on the new debt would be lower than on the
original debt. Instead, the debt was repurchased by BT from cash reserves.
However, the methodology for calculating the baseline prices was
'technically incorrect'.
