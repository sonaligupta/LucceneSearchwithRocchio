FT  13 NOV 93 / International Company News: Japanese steel groups slip into
red

   TOKYO


JAPAN'S five leading steel companies slipped into the red during the six
months ended September following the downturn in the domestic economy and
steady appreciation of the yen.
Nippon Steel, the world's largest steel producer, reported a pre-tax loss of
Y16.7bn (Dollars 155m) compared with a profit of Y14.1bn in the same period
last year, and the losses would have been more embarrassing if the company
had not taken a profit of Y17.6bn on sales of securities.
The pattern of heavy losses and large securities sales was seen at most of
the other leading steel groups, which have been in profit for the past six
years. They expect the second half will do further damage to their balance
sheets.
In response, Kobe Steel announced that it would join other makers in
requesting that staff take at least one extra day off each month from
January until March. Nippon Steel said executives would take a 15 per cent
pay cut from January.
Kobe reported a pre-tax loss of Y8.1bn, in spite of making a profit of
Y5.5bn from securities sales, NKK had a loss of Y15.4bn, Kawasaki Steel
Y8.3bn, and Sumitomo Metal Industries Y9bn. All had reported profits during
the same period last year.
Sumitomo said a cost-cutting drive had not compensated for the weakening of
domestic demand and the yen's strengthening. Along with the other makers,
Sumitomo will not pay an interim dividend.
The losses this year have raised questions about the steel companies'
diversification into computers and semiconductors, as well as forays into
theme parks, bicycle manufacturing and mushroom farming.
'As for the electronics, new materials and biomedical divisions, efforts
shall be concentrated on examining profitability in each field and in
identifying where profits can be improved as quickly as possible,' Sumitomo
said.
For NKK, which had profits of Y2.4bn on the sale of fixed assets and another
Y14.5bn from securities, the bright spot was that the company was not forced
to report a loss on the redemption of convertible bonds, which cost it
Y4.7bn in the same period last year.
The industry was fortunate in the first half to have strong export demand
from China, but Beijing's attempts to slow an overheated economy have led to
a fall in orders for Japanese steel over the past two months.
Kobe said demand from China earlier in the year had 'increased remarkably',
and the ratio of export sales to net sales rose to 19.1 per cent from 16.5
per cent in the same period last year.
Nippon Steel said the 'Japanese economy was shoved into deeper recession by
the continuing stagnation in private industry investment and consumer
spending', along with the yen's rise against the dollar.
'Further decreases in steel production and shipments are feared as domestic
demand in all fields, except public civil engineering projects, will remain
dull. Faced with this, Nippon Steel will restructure its mainstay steel
operations and steadily promote engineering and new businesses,' the company
said.
