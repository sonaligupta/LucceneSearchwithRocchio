FT  04 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Automotive side behind 36% rise at BBA


   By ROLAND RUDD


A STRONG performance from its automotive business helped BBA achieve its
first increase in pre-tax profits and earnings per share for two years.
On a significantly reduced cost base the automotive division reported a 36
per cent increase in trading profits, from Pounds 12.8m to Pounds 17.4m on
sales of Pounds 319m, up from Pounds 302.3m. Group trading profit increased
from Pounds 36.9m to Pounds 39.7m.
Mr John White, managing director, said new orders won by the friction
materials operation in Germany more than compensated for market fragility.
Car sales in Germany have fallen for two consecutive months and are expected
to continue to decline.
The division's margins improved from 5.2 per cent to 6.4 per cent.
A geographical breakdown of trading profits showed that the only fall was
experienced by North America, down from Pounds 17.7m to Pounds 14.5m. The
industrial division was most affected by the US recession with margins
falling from 9.1 per cent to 8.2 per cent.
COMMENT
Against a background of falling car sales across Europe a 5 per cent
increase in automotive sales is impressive. The cost cutting exercise has
ensured an immediate payback in profits. A report last year by UBS Phillips
& Drew showed that a 10 per cent cut in labour costs of the big automotive
components group would result in a 40 per cent to 50 per cent increase in
profits. That is a message BBA took to heart earlier than its rivals. Yet
with the fall in German car sales set to continue well into the next six
months, can BBA go on producing profit increases? The answer is probably
yes. With forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 65m, giving earnings per share
of 9.3p, the shares - up 8p to 133p - are on a prospective multiple of 14.3.
That does not look too demanding given the company's ability to produce
increased profits in a recession.
