FT  22 OCT 92 / Milosevic attacked on ethnic cleansing


   By LAURA SILBER


WESTERN embassies in Belgrade yesterday accused Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic of failing to condemn ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, and that warned
UN sanctions will not be lifted until the violence in Bosnia stops.
A statement sent jointly by the EC, the US, and the Conference on Security
and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), accused Mr Milosevic of not using his
influence to press Bosnian Serb forces into stopping ethnic cleansing or
atrocities in Bosnia.
It criticised Mr Milosevic for failing to publicly diassociate himself from
ethnic cleansing.
'The governments are appalled at the continuing evidence of human rights
abuses and ethnic cleansing in Bosnia-Hercegovina,' it added. The letter
named Bosnian Serb forces, who control 70 per cent of Bosnian territory, as
the 'principal offenders'.
It warned Mr Milosevic to heed the UN Security Council resolution on war
crimes of October 6.
