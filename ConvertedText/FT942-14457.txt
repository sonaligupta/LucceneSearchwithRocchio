FT  20 APR 94 / UK Company News: BDA returns to black as activity rises


BDA Holdings, the property investment and services group, reported increased
activity in the year to the end of January resulting in a turnround from
losses of Pounds 1.16m to profits of Pounds 152,000 pre-tax.
Turnover improved from Pounds 1.33m to Pounds 1.98m. The result was helped
by a release of provisions on carrying value of properties of Pounds
100,000, against provisions last time of Pounds 1.2m.
On prospects, Mr Brian Duker, chairman, said: 'We are finding that
transactions are price sensitive at all levels and therefore believe that
margins will remain constrained.'
Earnings per share were 0.8p (6.4p losses).
