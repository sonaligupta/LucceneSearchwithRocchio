FT  20 APR 91 / Industrial sales down in Poland


   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI


   WARSAW


INDUSTRIAL sales in Poland are continuing to fall, squeezing state sector
profits as well as budget revenues, figures for the first three months of
the year show, writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw.
The figures come as the IMF board is accepting Warsaw's letter of intent
which commits the Poles to maintain tight monetary controls, to try to
reduce the monthly inflation rate to 1 per cent by the end of the year.
Industrial sales fell 4.3 per cent in the first quarter compared with a year
ago. Consumer prices grew by 25 per cent in the first three months of the
year compared with the previous quarter, while incomes rose by 6.7 per cent
in the same period.
In foreign trade, the country had a Dollars 299m (Pounds 167m) first quarter
deficit, reflecting the collapse of sales to the Soviet Union as former
Comecon countries switched to hard currency pricing.
At the same time, the IMF has been told that Poland is determined to stick
to the exchange rate fixed at the beginning of 1990.
