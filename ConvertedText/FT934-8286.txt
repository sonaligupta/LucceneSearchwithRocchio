FT  16 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: VW taps Yankee sector for
Dollars 250m

   FRANKFURT


VOLKSWAGEN, Europe's largest manufacturer of motor vehicles, has become the
first German company to access the US corporate bond market.
The move reflects German companies' growing desire to gain access to the US
capital markets, the largest in the world. It follows Daimler-Benz's recent
decision to seek a full listing for its shares on the New York Stock
Exchange and the store group Kaufhof's move to establish a sponsored
American depositary receipt programme in the US.
Volkswagen sold a total of Dollars 250m of 'Yankee' debt securities last
week via a two-tranche rule 144a bond offering. Such an offering allows a
company to sell securities to large US investment institutions without being
obliged to comply with the Securities & Exchange Commission's full listing
requirements.
Mr Rutbert Reisch, VW's group treasurer said: 'A full listing would require
disclosures which we are not willing to make.'
Daimler's decision to seek a full listing required it to publish its
accounts under US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. This move
towards greater disclosure irritated other German companies, which were
displeased that Daimler had reached unilateral agreement with the SEC on the
the terms of a listing.
'It is not the disclosure (of our profit and loss account) which bothers
us,' said Mr Reisch at VW yesterday. 'It is the hidden reserves. Say we get
into a price war with the Japanese later in the decade: I don't want them to
know just how far we can go. It is not worth a listing.'
Despite the publicity surrounding Daimler's listing, the group has not yet
raised any cash directly from the US market. Deutsche Bank, 28 per cent
shareholder in Daimler, will be placing a 3 per cent stake worth DM1bn in
the US market early next year.
