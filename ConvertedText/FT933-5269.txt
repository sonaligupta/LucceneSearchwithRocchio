FT  04 SEP 93 / Kohl appeals for change in values

CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl yesterday appealed for public support for his
government's plan to reform the German economy and improve its
competitiveness as the August unemployment rate stayed for a second month at
its highest level this year.
Mr Kohl urged Germans to change their values and endorse a far-ranging
government paper which proposes to privatise and deregulate the economy and
reform the country's social security system. The 96-page document, drafted
by Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the economics minister, received cabinet backing on
Thursday night. It will form the basis of new laws to be presented to
parliament this autumn and next spring.
'We are calling above all on each and every one for a change in their
attitudes and thinking. Well-established habits must be checked and new
priorities must be set,' Mr Kohl said.
Spelling out why reforms of the country's generous social security system
were needed, Mr Kohl said: 'With so much studying, careers beginning at 30
and people retiring at 60, the bill just doesn't add up when life expectancy
is 80,' Mr Kohl said. 'You cannot expect the system, ladies and gentlemen,
to function for ever,' he said.
His comments were made as figures were released showing West Germany's
seasonally adjusted unemployment rate last month stood unchanged against
July at 7.5 per cent. The number of people out of work in both the western
and eastern parts of the country remained at 3.5m.
While unemployment fell marginally in the west, with 10,600 people finding
work, the jobless rate in the east climbed to 15.4 per cent against 15.3 per
cent in July.
