FT  17 JAN 92 / Police alert at Hyundai


   By REUTER


   SEOUL


SOUTH KOREAN riot police yesterday surrounded the troubled Hyundai car
plants where defiant union workers, armed with steel pipes, settled down for
a drawn-out occupation, Reuter reports from Seoul.
'We have hundreds of police outside the plants keeping watch. And over 1,000
more are coming from Pusan,' said the police in the nearby south-eastern
city of Ulsan.
Hyundai ordered the plants to close temporarily from today after unionists
voted on Tuesday to upgrade a five-month dispute over arrested employees
into full-time industrial action. The company said Hyundai would withhold 70
per cent of workers' salaries during the closure.
