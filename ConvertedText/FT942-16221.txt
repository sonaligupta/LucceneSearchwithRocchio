FT  12 APR 94 / World Trade News: US wildlife embargo on Taiwan


   By NANCY DUNNE


   WASHINGTON


US President Bill Clinton yesterday imposed an embargo on imports of
wildlife products from Taiwan because it had failed to stem trade in
rhinoceros and tiger parts, animals in danger of extinction, writes Nancy
Dunne in Washington.
China escaped similar sanctions after the US determined that it consolidated
and burned its stocks of rhino horn and tiger bone and enforced laws against
such trade.
The US action came under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered
Species.
