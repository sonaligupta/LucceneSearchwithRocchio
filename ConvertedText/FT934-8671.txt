   By EDWARD ORLEBAR


   GUATEMALA CITY


Guatemala's Constitutional Court temporarily suspended a plebiscite called
for November 28 by President Ramiro de Leon to force the resignation of
congress members and supreme court magistrates, writes Edward Orlebar in
Guatemala City. The court was concerned about the constitutional
implications of the plebiscite and gave the protagonists 15 days to make
their case.
