FT  03 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Venables sells most of his Spurs stake to
institutions


   By PAUL TAYLOR


MR TERRY Venables, Tottenham Hotspur's ousted chief executive, yesterday
gave up his three-month legal battle to wrest control of the company, which
controls the north London football club, from Mr Alan Sugar, its chairman.
Mr Venables said he had sold the bulk of his 23 per cent equity stake to a
group of institutional investors for 91p a share, or about Pounds 3m. He
retained only a 2.44 per cent holding.
Tottenham's shares ended the day 9p higher at 104p.
Mr Venables paid 75p for about 2.9m shares when he and Mr Sugar, described
at the time as a dream ticket, took control in mid-1991, mostly using
borrowed money.
He later converted a loan of Pounds 800,000 to the club into about 640,000
shares as part of a Pounds 7m rescue rights issue, at 125p a share, which
was underwritten by Mr Sugar.
Based on these figures, Mr Venables paid an average price of about 85p.
The share sale appears to mark another important victory for Mr Sugar, who
holds a 47.8 per cent stake.
Mr Venables will not now be going ahead with his High Court action, due to
begin in 10 days time, through which he was seeking to force Mr Sugar to
sell his stake to him.
Early in the dispute Mr Sugar offered to buy Mr Venables' stake at 87p a
share, an offer which the former manager and chief executive described at
the time as derisory.
However, Mr Venables faced mounting legal costs, including demands for a
Pounds 300,000 security for future costs. Yesterday Mr Venables said he was
dropping his court action because he did not want to risk incurring huge
costs if he lost the legal battle.
'I could not face the prospect or the risk of losing up to one million
pounds,' he said.
However, Mr Venables, who was originally sacked by Mr Sugar and the
Tottenham board in mid-May, said yesterday he would still be seeking
compensation for unfair dismissal.
