FT  25 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome up ahead of results


   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and  COLIN MILLHAM


PHARMACEUTICALS group Wellcome received a fillip ahead of tomorrow's interim
results as a number of brokers turned positive on the stock. The shares
rebounded from recent weakness to end 34 stronger at 978p.
Agency broker James Capel was advising clients to buy Wellcome after analyst
Mr Robin Gilbert recommended the stock at the house's morning meeting. He
said international prescription audit figures showed sales of Retrovir would
be up by 30 per cent against the same six-month period last year.
Further support came from Hoare Govett, which moved its recommendation from
hold to buy. Hoare's Mr James Culverwell believes the shares have
underperformed too far against the sector since majority owner Wellcome
Trust announced a planned share issue.
Security house County NatWest also reiterated Wellcome's strengths at its
morning meeting. The range of analysts' forecasts is between Pounds 235m to
Pounds 243m, against Pounds 181m in the same period last year.
Laporte placings
Chemicals group Laporte fell in early trading as the placing of old and new
shares commenced, but recovered later when the whole 22.5m found a home. The
stock closed a net 10 better at 567p.
Company broker BZW did the placing with large institutions at 533p per share
in a package consisting of two old and one new. The shares were sold outside
the market and turnover recorded on the Seaq electronic trading screens was
only 1.1m.
The 15.1m old shares represented an 8.7 per cent stake in the company
acquired from Solvay, of Belgium. This follows reorganisation of Interox,
jointly owned by Laporte and Solvay, which previously had 25 per cent of
Laporte.
The 7.6m new shares were issued to fund the Dollars 60m (Pounds 34.6m)
acquisition of Rockwood, a private US chemicals company supplying the
construction sector.
P & O pleases
Relief greeted P & O's maintained dividend and pre-tax profits, which were
at the top end of analysts' expectations. The biggest sigh, however, was
saved for the finalisation of the group's plans for its Pall Mall property
venture with Chelsfield.
Worries over the declining value of Pall Mall's property portfolio has been
undermining the stock in recent weeks. Yesterday the shares jumped 32 to
416p in exceptional volume of 9.5m.
The deal with Chelsfield gives P & O control of Pall Mall, but takes group
gearing from 45 to 70 per cent. Mr Clive Anderson at Smith New Court said
the clarification of the Pall Mall situation cleared up a lot of the
uncertainty surrounding P & O's financial and trading position. 'This,
together with the dividend, no warnings over future dividend payments, and
better than expected profits, has given the market what it was looking for.'
Mr Ian Wild at BZW was pleased with the group's service industry performance
and its passenger volumes. He has raised his pre-tax profits forecast for
1992 by Pounds 30m to Pounds 310m. Smith is looking for Pounds 300m, a rise
of Pounds 20m.
Steel weakness
British Steel came under renewed pressure as two more houses turned bearish
on the stock. Large volume of 17m left the shares off 5 at 70p as worries
over the group's final dividend continued to affect the market.
Mr Alasdair Stewart, at Nikko Securities, reiterated his sell stance as he
took account of recent comments by British Steel about trading conditions,
and the dividend reduction undertaken by Bridon, a steel rope manufacturer,
which reported its finals yesterday and which dropped 14 to 75p.
James Capel downgraded British Steel. The broker is looking for losses of
Pounds 80m to Pounds 100m this year and a final dividend of 4 1/2 p. The
move comes after Monday's sell reiteration from Smith New Court.
Steetley deals
The bid battle for Steetley moved into the final straight. Two big blocks of
Steetley shares were sold into the market, one a line of 3m shares and
another of 5.5m. The deadline for acceptances is 1pm tomorrow.
Most analysts are predicting that Redland will emerge as the winner. Its
cash offer of 365p a share values Steetley at Pounds 617m and would create a
building materials group with Pounds 2bn of combined annual turnover.
In expectation of a Redland victory, Morgan Stanley has issued a buy note on
the enlarged Redland group, analyst Mr Anthony Williams describing the group
as 'an outstanding force in international building materials'. He expects
Redland shares to reach 530p over 12 months. Yesterday Redland firmed 2 to
435p, while Steetley was steady at 366p in turnover of 10m.
Speculation that Lasmo would announce a big disposal with its final results
today died away and the shares closed unmoved at 204p after being up 4
initially. The company is adopting new accounting procedures and the figures
could well be worse than most expectations.
BP was 3 easier at 255p, with a seller of 3m shares at 255 1/2 p accounting
for a large chunk of the 13m turnover.
Some oil issues generated interest after agency broker James Capel's
technical analyst pointed out that they were reaching support levels.
Enterprise was one of them and the shares gained 9 to 389p.
Glaxo forged ahead 32 to 814p on healthy turnover of 4.2m shares. Traders
said Kleinwort Benson was aggressively on the bid ahead of a pharmaceuticals
conference to be hosted by the house this week. Kleinwort divorced itself
from the interest and cited continued US buying.
Wessex remained the recovery stock among water companies, shrugging off
political worries and gaining 12 to 387p on hopes of profits from waste
disposal. Waste Management International, its partner in this venture, is
about to float its shares in London and New York.
Theme park operator Euro Disney tumbled 63 to 1590p after a downgrade by
Goldman Sachs. BET received similar treatment from UBS Phillips & Drew and
lost 2 to 129p.
A big agency cross in BPB Industries by Cazenove saw 8.6m shares dealt both
ways at 155p. BPB was off 2 at 157p.
Publishers bounced back on opinion polls favourable to the Tories. Pearson
advanced 15 to 785p and Reed International 12 to 511p.
Costs of a loss-making joint venture with Geest knocked 24 off Associated
Fisheries to 118p.
