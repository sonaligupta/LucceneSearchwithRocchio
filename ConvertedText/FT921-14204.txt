FT  17 JAN 92 / Death sentences stand in Cuba

   MEXICO CITY


CUBA'S Supreme Court upheld late on Wednesday the death sentences on two
Miami residents who tried to infiltrate the island, but commuted the death
sentence on their associate to 30 years in jail, AP writes from Mexico City.
The decision came after a five-hour hearing in which the men expressed
remorse and pleaded for their lives. They confirmed Cuban claims that they
had been trained and armed in the US for sabotage in Cuba, with the
knowledge of the Washington government.
The Council of State is to hear a further appeal.
