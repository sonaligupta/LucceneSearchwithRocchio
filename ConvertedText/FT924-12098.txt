FT  22 OCT 92 / Crown tries again to sell RFM


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


CROWN Communications said yesterday it had entered into a second conditional
agreement for the sale of RFM, its loss-making French commercial radio
network.
The first conditional sale to a consortium led by NRJ, a rival radio group,
was rejected by the Conseil Superieur de l'Audiovisuel, the regulatory body.
Under the new arrangement the leading shareholder would be Mr Alain Ayache,
a controversial right-of-centre magazine publisher.
Mr Ayache announced earlier this week he would have 32.5 per cent of RFM
with Crown holding 20 per cent, NRJ 22.5 per cent and Credit Mutuel
d'Artois, a French bank, 25 per cent.
Crown, the USM-quoted commercial radio company which owns the London
Broadcasting Company, said yesterday it considered it likely that the new
deal would meet with CSA approval.
CSA officials have emphasised to French newspapers that no dossier on the
issue had been submitted and no transfer of shares in French radio stations
were valid without CSA approval.
RFM is currently under the direct control of a provisional director
appointed by the French courts - something that happened without the
knowledge of the Crown board.
Crown directors said yesterday they were confident 'that his appointment
will not impede the proposed sale.' It was not clear last night whether the
provisional administrator had been informed of the conditional sale.
