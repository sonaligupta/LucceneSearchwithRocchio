FT  29 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Eurocamp in line with rise to Pounds 8m


   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent


EUROCAMP, the camping holiday company which was floated last July, yesterday
reported pro forma pre-tax profits of Pounds 8.16m for the year to
end-October.
The figure, which compared with Pounds 5.66m previously, was struck on the
back of a 5 per cent increase in turnover to Pounds 49m and after interest
charges reduced from Pounds 2.06m to Pounds 470,000.
Operating profits of Pounds 8.63m compared with the Pounds 8.5m forecast at
the time of flotation.
The directors said the Gulf war had hampered business. Total bookings of
about 70,000 camping parties in 1991 were only slightly higher than in 1990.
The company reported large increases in its businesses on the continent with
bookings from the Netherlands and Germany up some 20 per cent and 50 per
cent respectively.
Bookings from the Netherlands accounted for 21 per cent of total business in
unit terms, with those from Germany making up 14 per cent.
The dividend is the 5.5p forecast in the prospectus. Pro forma earnings per
share were 21.1p (19.1p).
Mr Richard Atkinson, managing director, said Eurocamp's UK bookings up to
the end of December last year were 15 per cent up on the same period in
1990.
