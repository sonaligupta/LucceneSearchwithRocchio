FT  22 OCT 92 / MSR will not complete rig buy


   By ROLAND RUDD


REPORTING A Pounds 1.9m pre-tax loss for the six months to June 30, Midland
and Scottish Resources said it would not exercise its option to complete the
purchase of the Emerald Producer offshore rig.
This means that Davy Corporation shareholders will not receive the remaining
Pounds 54m, or 45p a share, due under the takeover of the company by
Trafalgar House, the engineering and construction group.
Trafalgar made payment to Davy shareholders conditional on MSR, the oil
production company, completing the purchase from Davy of the Emerald
Producer.
MSR's Emerald Field Contracting subsidiary does not expect to secure the
first class bank guarantees needed to obtain a Section 10 ship certificate
from the Department of Trade necessary to complete permanent finance of the
rig.
The oil production company will continue to charter the Emerald Producer
from Trafalgar at Dollars 65,000 (Pounds 39,800) a day.
MSR's Pounds 1.9m loss compares with a Pounds 3m deficit last year. For the
year to 1991 the group incurred a Pounds 46.4m loss after a Pounds 37.5m
exceptional charge relating to the delay in completing the rig.
Turnover was halved to Pounds 1.9m and the cost of sales declined to Pounds
1.4m (Pounds 4.8m). Losses per share were 0.93p (1.3p).
