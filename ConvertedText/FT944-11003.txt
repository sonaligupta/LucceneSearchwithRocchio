FT  08 NOV 94 / International Company News: May Stores earnings up 4.5%

   NEW YORK


May Department Stores, the biggest US department store group, yesterday
opened the quarterly results season for US retailers by reporting a modest
4.5 per cent increase in after-tax profits for the three months to October.
Net income rose from Dollars 133m to Dollars 139m, but May said the latest
figure would have been Dollars 145m had it not been for its share of the
cost of settling a lawsuit filed against the company and its investment bank
by certain bondholders in 1992.
Fully-diluted earnings per share, including the litigation charge, rose from
49 cents to 51 cents.
May operates 309 department stores and 4,062 Payless ShoeSource stores in
the US.
Revenues at stores open for more than a year rose by 4.4 per cent in the
department store group but fell by 2.6 per cent in the Payless ShoeSource
group.
This sluggishness in store-for-store sales growth was offset by May's
aggressive store-opening programme.
During the quarter the group opened 10 new department stores, making a total
of 11 in the year-to-date, and also ended the quarter with 193 more Payless
ShoeSource stores, for a total of 283 year-to-date.
As a result, total department store revenues rose by 7 per cent to Dollars
2.33bn and Payless ShoeSource revenues rose by 4 per cent to Dollars 540m,
producing an overall 6 per cent increase in revenues to Dollars 2.87bn.
