FT  22 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Aviation setback leaves Hunting down at
Pounds 13.5m


   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE


Tough trading conditions in the aviation business dented first half pre-tax
profits at Hunting, which yesterday reported a 24 per cent decline from
Pounds 17.7m to Pounds 13.5m - although last year's figure was flattered by
a Pounds 5.8m contribution from the sale of a subsidiary.
At the operating level, profits from continuing operations were down 10 per
cent from Pounds 18.3m to Pounds 16.5m.
Operating profits in the aviation division fell from Pounds 3.7m to Pounds
1.5m on turnover up 9 per cent at Pounds 81.1m (Pounds 74.7m). A lack of
orders from both the civil and military aviation sides hit the group's
overhauling and fitting business. Likewise, slack demand for the Saab 340
and BAe Jetstream 41 aircraft affected the company's interiors business.
On the defence side, operating profits rose 42 per cent to Pounds 7.4m
(Pounds 5.2m) on turnover 77 per cent ahead at Pounds 223.8m (Pounds
126.7m). The figures were boosted by the first full interim contribution
from the management contract to run the Atom-ic Weapons Establishment at
Aldermaston. This included an operating profit of Pounds 2.8m.
Profits from the oil services business were hit by weak oil prices in the
first quarter, declining 19 per cent to Pounds 7.6m (Pounds 9.4m). Turnover
fell 17 per cent to Pounds 254.2m (Pounds 305.3m).
Group turnover advanced 10 per cent to Pounds 559.1m (Pounds 509.8m).
Earnings per share fell from 8.3p to 4.6p. The interim dividend is
maintained at 4p.
Despite the downturn, Mr Ken Miller, chief executive, was optimistic on the
outlook for the group. 'There have been special circumstances this year
which have affected our performance. But the benefits from our cost saving
programme will come through next year, the outlook for the aviation business
is more favourable, the defence business order book is good and there's more
activity in the oil business.'
The market took a dimmer view and the shares slipped 3p to 159p, their
lowest point since December 1993. Analysts cut their profit forecasts for
the year by about 15 per cent, with most settling in a range from Pounds 28m
to Pounds 31m.
