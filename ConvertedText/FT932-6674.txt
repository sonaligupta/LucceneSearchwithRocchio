FT  27 MAY 93 / Letter: Macbeth gripping, not a mess


   From JOHN and BARBARA RICHARDSON


Sir, Recently one of your correspondents wondered if your critic had
actually been to the event he was reviewing. We certainly wondered whether
we had been to the same production of Verdi's Macbeth at the Coliseum which
Richard Fairman reviewed ('Macbeth in a mess', May 22). His outright
rubbishing of this production left us wondering what we were in for, and led
to us offering one of our party his money back before we set out.
In fact, we all enjoyed Macbeth enormously; the production was gripping and
inventive; Kristine Ciesinski was as theatrical a Lady Macbeth as you could
hope to find; Verdi's brass writing had us on the edge of our seats; and the
chorus was as lusty as you could wish. One of us had recently seen the
Covent Garden Otello, and thought there was no comparison.
Good luck to Poultney in his new job. We only hope his successor can do as
well. As to your man Fairman, eye of a newt for him.
