FT  27 JUL 92 / Observer: Arresting case


Howard Davies, the CBI's high profile new director general, has an
intriguing explanation for the bizarre affair of Alison Halford and her
inability to win promotion in the Merseyside police force.
Davies, a former boss of the Audit Commission, blames a manpower control
system operated by the Home Office under which police forces can bid each
year for the right to employ additional officers. Every year some new
constables are allocated. 'There is no provision in the system for police
numbers to fall, ever', says Davies, in a column in last Friday's Evening
Standard.
As a result of this system there are now almost twice as many policemen per
thousand inhabitants in declining Merseyside as in Cambridgeshire, where the
population is growing. Merseyside is the most intensely policed area in the
country. 'No wonder they have to find exotic ways of passing the time', says
Davies.
Indeed, he calculates that if present trends continue there will be only
policemen left in Merseyside 60 years from now and if they do not recruit
any women the force will die out.
