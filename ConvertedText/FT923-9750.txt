FT  04 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading


   By JOEL KIBAZO


THE FIRMER performance by sterling, which followed news of an opinion poll
showing a majority of the French public in favour of the Maastricht treaty,
helped to boost stock index futures already strengthened by an early
squeeze, writes Joel Kibazo.
The FT-SE futures contract for September delivery opened at 2,402 and was
soon in demand as independent traders moved to cover short positions. This
early strength helped to lift the underlying cash market from weakness seen
at its opening.
The squeeze in the contract continued and by mid-morning it was trading at
2,425. News of the opinion poll only served to add to the upward momentum,
as did strength in gilts. The firm opening on Wall Street also provided
further help and the session's high of 2,449 was reached just before the
official market close of 2,445. This was 31 up from the previous close and
around 18 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 12.
Turnover at 6,184 lots was poor.
The volume in traded options reached 26,312 contracts in a session said to
have lacked strong features. The FT-SE 100 option recorded 10,051 lots, with
the Euro FTSE option trading 4,624.
