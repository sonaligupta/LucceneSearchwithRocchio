Philip Environmental, which has built a leading position in North American
industrial waste management in four years, reported 1993 net profit of
CDollars 19.7m (USDollars 14.5m), or 60 cents a share, up 8 per cent from
CDollars 18.3m, or 60 cents, on fewer shares in 1992.
Revenues jumped 61 per cent to CDollars 253m because of acquisitions.
Fourth-quarter profit was CDollars 7.9m, or 23 cents a share, against
CDollars 5m, or 16 cents, on sales of CDollars 112m against CDollars 42m.
Philip, controlled by Toronto's Fracassi brothers and 10 per cent held by St
Lawrence Cement, eastern Canada's biggest cement producer, has completed an
acquisition spree that doubled its asset base to CDollars 700m.
Philip went public in 1991 and swiftly bought up 20 companies in Canada for
nearly CDollars 300m. Late in 1993 a USDollars 120m financing enabled it to
buy two US recycling companies. Now 40 per cent of revenues come from the
US.
Philip is Canada's biggest recycler of commercial and industrial waste and a
leading US recycler of hazardous waste. It also operates an environmental
consulting business. It supplies waste oil to St Lawrence as a fuel for its
cement kilns.
Mr Alan Fracassi, president, said Philip was now consolidating and would
cope with its high debt level of about CDollars 300m. Revenues in 1994 are
expected to reach about CDollars 400m, and Philip's long-term ambition is to
become number three in North American waste management.
