FT  30 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Midland sale


Newly-floated newspaper group Midland Independent Newspapers was among the
most actively traded stocks as one of its backers sold an 8 per cent stake
in the company.
The seller is believed to be the Italian arm of a venture capital group
which had bought shares at 140p at the time of the March flotation.
Yesterday, it turned a 23 per cent profit placing 11.6m shares in the market
at 172p a share via the company's broker, James Capel, which then sold them
on to two institutions at 173p a share. Midland shares rose a half penny to
176 1/2 p on turnover of 23m.
RJB Mining was also among the most heavily traded stocks as two investment
funds sold stakes worth a total of Pounds 50m. Schroder Venture Managers
sold 25.81 per cent or 11.73m shares and Charterhouse Capital sold 6 per
cent or 2.7m stakes in the company. BZW the company's broker placed the
shares with institutional investors. The shares eased a penny to 364p.
The investment strategies of the cash generative stores groups were
highlighted by one leading broker finding in favour of Boots and Great
Universal Stores and recommending positive dividend policies to soak up the
companies' cash mountains. GUS - steady at 601p yesterday - has been the
subject of much market speculation in recent weeks over how it intends to
use its Pounds 1.5bn of cash, with market gossip focusing on a possible
share buy-back. Boots put on 3 1/2 to 547 1/2 p. But Marks and Spencer
slipped 2 1/2 to 438 1/2 p.
The two big share losers in the leisure sector this week - Airtours and
Compass Group - both staged rallies yesterday as bargain-hunters moved in.
Holiday group Airtours bounced 5 to 429p, still only slightly denting its
net fall this week of 55. The steep decline was prompted by the purchase of
SAS Leisure, a Scandinavian holiday group, for Pounds 74m to be funded
largely by a rights issue. Compass gained 7 to 315p, making its fall since
talk of its Pounds 300m US deal and rights issue came into the market two
weeks ago, a net 44.
Big turnover in Rank Organisation came as a big buy order begun on Wednesday
was finally wound up, according to dealers. Rank shares added a penny to
430p on final volume of 8.1m.
Food and detergent giant Unilever recovered ground after it announced that
it was to sue its rival Proctor & Gamble over remarks allegedly made against
the former's new soap powder. The shares ended the session 8 1/2 adrift at
1072 1/2 p, after 1065p.
Royal Bank of Scotland bounced 9 to 402p as investors switched funds from
elsewhere in the sector ahead of the Scottish bank's interim figures on May
11. There had been speculation earlier in the day that RBoS was poised to
buy the National & Provincial Building Society but the rumours were
dismissed by analysts.
Big dollar earner HSBC tumbled 22 to 706p in response to the weakness of the
US currency.
Paper and packaging stocks rose sharply in response to a newspaper article
which cited increases in North American and European newsprint groups and
lifted hopes that prices and margins were improving. Arjo Wiggins Appleton
gained 7 to 315p and Bowater rose 8 to 460p.
Weak gilts and continuing negative sentiment over regulatory issues kept the
water and electricity utilities under a cloud, although the late afternoon
gilt rally produced a small bounce.
Among the Recs, Midlands slid 19 to 568p, Southern 11 1/2 to 570 1/2 p and
Eastern 15 to 578p. The generators, under less regulatory threat, held up,
with National Power off 4 at 428p and PowerGen 2 1/2 at 481 1/2 p.
Mobile telecoms group Vodafone continued its recovery following worries,
considered overdone by many in the market, over the threat of competition.
The shares added 5 to 544p. But both competition and regulatory concerns
were said to be again overhanging BT as the fully-paid shares hit their
lowest point of the year and the lowest level since October 1993, down 8 at
368 1/2 p on 6.4m traded. The partly-paid retreated 7 to 251p.
A profits warning from Canadian Pizza sent the shares retreating 46 to 120p.
The company, which supplies products to outlets such as Sainsbury, blamed
lower sales.
In the drinks sector, sentiment was boosted by the clearing of two major
deals, Allied Lyons' Pounds 700m merger with Domecq of Spain and Guinness'
restructuring of its shareholding in French group LVMH. Allied shares added
a penny to 587p, Guinness 3 to 480p and other spirits giant Grand
Metropolitan chipped in with a rise of 7 to 476p.
Car dealer Lex Retail Group moved ahead 3 to 545p after announcing a 17 per
cent increase in new car registrations in the first quarter.
