FT  13 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: RTZ


The 3 per cent gain in RTZ shares in yesterday's weak market had a logic
which went beyond the immediate impact of its results. With 80 per cent of
its turnover abroad, the company can face UK electoral turmoil with
equanimity. Indeed, if that leads to a weak pound, so much the better for
RTZ's earnings. Its products are mostly denominated in dollars and their
price should in any case start to firm as evidence of US recovery grows.
Strip out the Pounds 74m exceptional depreciation charge for Kennecott's
Utah cooper smelter and 1991 profits were above expectations. The strong
balance sheet means the new Dollars 880m smelter, itself likely to enhance
margins substantially, can be financed with ease.
Still, it would not do to get carried away. The metals markets are
vulnerable to upset by selling from the former Soviet Union. This year will
not see a repeat of the strong contribution from Hamersley ore sales to
Japan where the economy is turning down. RTZ says it will not allow its
surplus ACT problem to upset its progressive dividend policy, but that means
investors may have to live with a lower cover ratio than they have been used
to in the past.
