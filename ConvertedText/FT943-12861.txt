FT  22 JUL 94 / Observer: Chirac snaps


Jacques Chirac is no stranger to the front covers of French magazines; as
former prime minister, present mayor of Paris and prospective presidential
candidate, he graces them continually. But it's strange to see him
apparently fare-dodging - by vaulting over a Metro turnstile on the front
cover of this week's Le Nouvel Observateur. The headline? 'The France that
Cheats'.
Chirac is not named on the cover or the accompanying story, which argues
that tax evasion, fare dodging and other fiddles are now commonplace in
France. But it's him all right.
His office says it was taken 'in good humour' 18 years ago during a Metro
equipment breakdown, when a younger Chirac leap-frogged over a ticket
turnstile.
Chirac doesn't see the joke. He has accused Le Nouvel Observateur of
'serious violation of press ethics' - and is suing.
