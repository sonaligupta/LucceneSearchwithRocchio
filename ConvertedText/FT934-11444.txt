FT  01 NOV 93 / Iraqgate affair official dies in Washington


   By ALAN FRIEDMAN


   NEW YORK


MR Frank Lemay, the US State Department official who warned the Bush
administration that Iraq was misusing US government-backed loans to fund its
nuclear weapons project, has died in Washington at the age of 36.
Mr Lemay, who succumbed to complications from Aids, last year testified
about the Iraqgate affair before the House Judiciary Committee. His
testimony spurred congressional calls for a special prosecutor for the
scandal.
Mr Lemay went before Congress after Democratic legislators revealed a 1989
memorandum of his in which he reported that funds from the Atlanta branch of
Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) were being diverted by Baghdad for
its war machine.
The Lemay memo said: 'If smoke indicates fire, we may be facing a four-alarm
blaze in the near future.' The memo was considered so sensitive that it was
stamped 'not for the system' when it reached aides to Mr James Baker, the
then secretary of state.
