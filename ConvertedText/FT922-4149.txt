FT  06 JUN 92 / Uproar at UN peace troops bill


   By STEFAN WAGSTYL


JAPANESE politicians were locked in intense negotiations last night over the
passage through the Diet of a bill which would allow Japanese troops to
serve in United Nations peacekeeping missions, writes Stefan Wagstyl.
The bill, which went through the lower house last December, passed through a
key upper house committee amid uproar early yesterday.
More than 500 people demonstrated outside the Diet during the committee's
night-time sitting. Two small bombs exploded outside the office of one
member of the ruling Liberal Democratic party and outside the home of
another.
The bill would allow Japanese troops to take part in peacekeeping missions,
but not in front-line roles, such as monitoring ceasefires, only in support
roles, such as transport.
Divisions in the Diet reflect the anxiety which the bill has caused: while
some Japanese support the government's case that Japan must play a bigger
world role, others argue the bill infringes the country's pacifist
constitution.
