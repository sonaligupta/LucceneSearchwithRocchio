FT  30 JAN 92 / International Company News: Motorola and Unisys strike R&D
accord

UNISYS and Motorola have expanded their collaboration in chip technology
development, manufacturing and design by entering a semiconductor technology
alliance.
Motorola, the largest US semiconductor manufacturer, is already a main
supplier to Unisys, the US computer group. Under the new agreement, however,
Unisys and Motorola will jointly define new chip production process and
design technologies for customised chips to be used in future Unisys
mainframe computer systems.
Unisys said it would phase out its last chip-making operation, in
California, making the company the largest computer manufacturer to rely
entirely on outside sources for its semiconductor supplies.
'The alliance confirms our commitment to focus our resources where we add
unique value, and team with industry leaders in other disciplines,' said Mr
James Unruh, Unisys chairman and chief executive.
Under the agreement, Unisys, the third largest US computer maker, will gain
earlier access to Motorola advances in chip design.
Unisys will incorporate Motorola semiconductor devices into future mainframe
computer systems, and joint engineering teams will define and develop
semiconductor products.
The Unisys-Motorola alliance follows an agreement between Unisys and Intel,
announced late last year, in which Unisys agreed to standardise its open
systems product lines on Intel microprocessors.
The new agreement with Motorola means that Unisys will base its customised
semiconductor requirements on Motorola technology.
For Unisys, the semi-conductor partnerships represent a way of reducing
development and manufacturing costs, at a time when the computer company is
struggling to maintain profitability.
