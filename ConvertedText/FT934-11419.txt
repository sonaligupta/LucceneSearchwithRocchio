FT  01 NOV 93 / Steelworkers' scheme to end


THE Iron and Steel Employees Readaptation Benefits Scheme, which has helped
about 118,000 former steelworkers with income support and benefits for
retraining, is to end, the government has announced.
Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, said in a Commons written answer that
the scheme had not been very effective in assisting redundant steelworkers
re-enter the labour market and had not proved good value for money.
The scheme was established in 1974 after the first oil price shock and
anticipated big plant closures in the late 1970s. Mr Sainsbury said further
large-scale restructuring was not expected in the industry.
A consultation paper is being issued, with comments invited by December 10.
