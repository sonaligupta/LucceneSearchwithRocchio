FT  29 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Local authorities warn on
legislation - Poll Tax


   By ALISON SMITH


MINISTERS came under renewed pressure yesterday to legislate more urgently
to end the confusion about the use of computer evidence in poll tax
non-payment cases in magistrates' courts.
In meetings with ministers and officials, local-authority association
representatives warned the government of the problems that would arise from
the decision to deal with the issue in the council tax bill, which is
expected to become law in early March.
Labour's local-government spokesmen, Mr Bryan Gould and Mr David Blunkett,
repeated Labour's offer to co-operate with an emergency bill to close the
loophole so it could pass through the Commons on a single day.
In a letter to Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, Mr Gould
said councils would not be able to proceed with effective enforcement
procedures until the council tax bill had become law, and said authorities
might be flooded with legal challenges to the liability orders that have
already been issued.
Mr Michael Portillo, the local-government minister, said that the arrival of
the summonses was the most important element in getting people to pay the
poll tax, and there was nothing to stop councils issuing summonses, even if
they decided not to take cases to court before the computer evidence
question was clarified.
He added that altering the law on civil evidence through regulations would
have saved perhaps only a couple of weeks, as changes to regulations would
have to be followed by guidance to the courts.
It would, he asserted, have been 'very odd' to take a new and separate bill
to deal just with computer evidence in poll tax cases.
In response to concern about how poll tax collection difficulties would
apply also to the collection of the business rate, where individual amounts
owed were much greater, the local-authority associations received a
commitment from Department of the Environment officials that developments
would be monitored.
The government's proposed change which will ensure that computer evidence
can be used will apply only to poll tax, business rates and - in future -
council tax non-payment cases.
