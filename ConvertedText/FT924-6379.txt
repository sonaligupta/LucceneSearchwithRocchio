FT  21 NOV 92 / UK Company News: BET poised for 44% downturn


   By RICHARD GOURLAY


BET is likely to report interim profits down 44 per cent at Pounds 40m when
it reports on Monday, as the business services group continues to suffer
from the lack of turnround in the economy.
The pre-tax profits fall from Pounds 71.5m in the corresponding period last
year is likely to include about Pounds 14m of exceptional provisions to
cover an increase in the number of disposals.
The City is expecting the full year dividend to be maintained after last
year's cut.
However in order for BET to maintain its practice of paying two thirds of
the dividend at the full year, the interim dividend is likely to be halved.
City observers are most interested in the progress of a disposal programme
that Mr John Clark, chief executive, has flagged as a prerequisite for a
return to a growth path.
Most of the companies likely to be sold are low-margin businesses like plant
hire and office cleaning.
One analyst said that BET had been hoping for an upturn in the economy which
had not materialised.
'Not only was the volume not there, but price competition has gone from bad
to worse,' he said.
