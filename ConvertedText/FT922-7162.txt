FT  20 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Cost containment helps BOC advance to
Pounds 163m


   By PAUL ABRAHAMS


BOC, the UK industrial gases and healthcare concern, yesterday reported
pre-tax profits up 12 per cent from Pounds 144.7m to Pounds 162.7m for the
six months to March 31.
The company said most markets had failed to show tangible signs of a
recovery and warned that hitherto buoyant areas such as Japan were
experiencing a slow-down in growth rates. Earnings per share increased 11
per cent from 19.14p to 21.3p.
Most of the improvement had been through cost-containment. Currency gains
accounted for Pounds 4m of operating profits, according to Mr Ian Clubb,
finance director. He said without them, pre-tax profits would have increased
9 per cent.
'We feel comfortable with the results,' said Mr Clubb. 'If the much
talked-about upturn in the world economy takes place, the company will be
well-placed to take advantage of it.'
The gases businesses experienced mixed fortunes as operating profits
increased 6 per cent from Pounds 136m to Pounds 144.5m on turnover of Pounds
1.01bn (Pounds 932.8m).
Mr Clubb said demand for liquefied gases for general purpose use had
increased in the UK and US by about 4 to 5 per cent over the past few months
compared with last year.
However sales of compressed gases, used for welding and cutting, had not
picked up. Sales of piped gases for bulk users had also remained flat. The
plant design and construction businesses had experienced a fall in demand.
Operating profits at the healthcare division increased 22 per cent from
Pounds 40.7m to Pounds 49.8m on turnover of Pounds 291m (Pounds 268.8m).
Mr Clubb said rationalisation at Glasrock, the home health care operation,
meant it was only two-thirds of its previous size, but that it was now
showing a modest profit. The US pharmaceuticals operations performed
particularly well.
The vacuum technology and distribution services operations' operating
profits were severely affected by the recession, falling from Pounds 12.6m
last year to Pounds 6.8m on turnover of Pounds 131.9m (Pounds 126m).
Results at the distribution services business improved their results and all
of the fall was due to the vacuum side of the operations. Mr Clubb said
sales of pumps for the semiconductor industry had been suffering from a
freeze on capital expenditure.
A second interim dividend of 11p was declared, representing an increase of 8
per cent in the annual dividend.
BOC's shares fell 15p to 703p on profit-taking.
