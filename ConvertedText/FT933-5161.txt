FT  04 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: The Week Ahead


GLAXO, reporting full year results on Thursday, might sound more cheerful
about its prospects in the US following President Clinton's more
conciliatory message about health care reforms this week.
Pre-tax profits for the year ended June are forecast at around Pounds 1.65bn
against Pounds 1.43bn a year earlier. Underlying sales growth will be in the
low teens but sales of new drugs might be somewhat disappointing. A final
dividend of 13p is likely making 20p for the year (17p a year ago).
Cadbury Schweppes is expected to deliver results in line with management's
bullish assessments of trading in recent months when it reports first-half
figures on Thursday. Many analysts forecast pre-tax profits of at least
Pounds 160m, up from Pounds 126m last time.
Forecasts for Prudential, reporting on Wednesday, vary widely from Pounds
218m-280m pre-tax against Pounds 249m a year earlier. an increase in
dividend to about 4.5p from 4.1p is also forecast. Better life insurance
performance will be over-shadowed by further heavy losses on re-insurance.
George Wimpey, reports on the same day. Some analysts forecast a small
interim pre-tax profit, others a small loss, against a loss of Pounds 7.2m a
year ago.
Blue Circle should report on Thursday interim pre-tax profits slightly ahead
with the dividend unchanged. AMEC's interim pre-tax profits are likely to be
slightly lower than last year's Pounds 10.6m.
Following a recent trading statement, Hillsdown Holdings' results on Tuesday
will be carefully scrutinised. It said it would achieve operating profits of
not less than Pounds 80m but it has its work cut out to improve the
profitability of its diverse food businesses. Coats Viyella on Thursday is
forecast to report a moderate rise in interim pre-tax profits to about
Pounds 54m from Pounds 46.5m a year earlier.
