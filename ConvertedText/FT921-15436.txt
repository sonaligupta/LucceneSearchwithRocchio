FT  10 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Pittencrieff offer for AmBrit lapses


The hostile offer for AmBrit International from Pittencrieff, the oil
production and communications group, lapsed yesterday with Pittencrieff
having received acceptances in respect of just 3.4m shares (5.2 per cent)
and Pounds 436,102 nominal of the loan stock (48.6 per cent).
Together with its existing holding, Pittencrieff now has a total of 23m
AmBrit shares (35.1 per cent).
On Wednesday United Energy, the USM-quoted oil and gas group, made an agreed
offer for AmBrit, valuing the oil and gas company at Pounds 7.3m and its
loan stock at Pounds 1.1m.
Pittencrieff expects to profit significantly from its offer as its holding
in AmBrit at United's cash alternative of 9p per share should realise a
gross profit of about Pounds 685,000.
Pittencrieff's shares rose 12p to close at 202p yesterday.
