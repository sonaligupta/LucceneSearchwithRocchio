FT  28 JAN 94 / Dealers say tactic is not a runner


   By MOTOKO RICH


Independent second-hand car dealers and their customers in London were
yesterday sceptical about Ford's venture.
Mr Roger Firth, owner of Southwark Park Service Station in south London,
said: 'I do not think the trade is going to lose sleep over it.'
Mr Terry Stockdale, manager of John's Autos in east London, said: 'I reckon
the manufacturer's dealers will mark up their prices by at least Pounds
200-300 more than us.'
Mr Terrence Puleston (above), co-owner of T & T Autos, also in east London,
said: 'I think Ford will come unstuck the way business is going. The trade
is so bad that it comes in silly spasms, one week you might sell three cars
and then another three weeks you might not sell any.'
One of Ford's biggest selling points for the scheme is its 12-month
warranty. But most independent dealers already offer private warranty
schemes. Mr Richard Davis, who bought a used Ford Fiesta from John's Autos
yesterday, said: 'I have bought about 10 cars from used-car dealers and I
have been happy.'
A woman who had brought a male friend to help her look for a car at
Westcombe Carriage agreed with the Ford finding that dealers prefer to talk
to men.
She said: 'Used-car dealers think they can pull one over on the women.
'But I don't mind because it is the car I am going to drive not the person
selling it.'
