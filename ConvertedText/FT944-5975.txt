FT  01 DEC 94 / Farmers 'fail to reap tree profits'


   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES


Farmers in some parts of the country could earn up to Pounds 300 a hectare
more from forestry than from agriculture, says a study published yesterday
by the Forestry Industry Committee of Great Britain.
The report of the committee, which represents timber processors and private
woodland operators, highlights the West Country and a section of the country
running north from Cheshire to the Cumbria border as the most cost-effective
regions for converting farmland to forests.
It is based on an analysis of crop gross margins on a range of land classes
and soil types in England and Wales. It shows that forestry can be more
profitable than dairying and grassland, but cannot usually compete with
arable farming.
Leicestershire, Derbyshire and Staffordshire, where the government plans to
encourage the planting of 200 square miles to create the National Forest,
shows up as a particularly uncompetitive area in which to plant trees
because farming is so profitable.
Mr Peter Wilson, chief executive of the Timber Growers Association, which
represents commercial forestry companies, said: 'No rational person would
convert farmland into forestry in that area unless a great deal of money is
available as an incentive.'
The committee wants its study to be used by planners and policymakers to
promote planting of woodland in areas which are most suitable and where it
would be most profitable.
Britain imports the bulk of its timber and in spite of government targets
aimed at encouraging the planting of 33,000 hectares of forestry a year,
actual plantings are running at about half that rate.
