FT  15 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Taiwan quits steel mill project


   By KIERAN COOKE


   SINGAPORE


Taiwan has confirmed it is withdrawing from a planned Dollars 360m (Pounds
234m) investment in a Malaysian steel mill, writes Kieran Cooke in
Singapore.
State-run China Steel was to have co-operated in the project with the Kuala
Lumpur government and Malaysia's Lion Group. But Taiwan's parliament has
blocked China Steel's investment, saying the company should expand in Taiwan
before investing overseas. Malaysia says the steel mill project will go
ahead.
