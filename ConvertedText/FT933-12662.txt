FT  23 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Hitachi in deal to sell Apple PCs


   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO

HITACHI will sell Macintosh personal computers made by Apple of the US as
part of its client-server systems, the Japanese electronics group said
yesterday.
The deal reflects the growing interdependence of companies in the computer
industry as well as a move towards more open systems in which computer users
are able to use a combination of machines from different companies.
Hitachi will buy the PCs from Canon Sales, a subsidiary of the camera and
office equipment maker which is one of Apple's main distributors in Japan.
Canon Sales for its part will sell Hitachi's workstations and servers. A
server is the master computer in a PC network which stores and provides
access to programmes and network facilities. The deal - the first tie-up
between the two companies - also calls for Hitachi and Canon Sales to
develop software jointly for the new systems.
The Macintosh PCs to be sold by Hitachi will be part of its client-server
systems which will use Hitachi's workstations for the central database and
Apple's PCs as the client.
Apple has been making substantial inroads into the Japanese computer market
and, according to Dataquest, the high technology consultancy, it is in third
place in market share, with 8.3 per cent of the market.
Hitachi currently sells systems using its own PCs but the company felt the
growing interest among Japanese users for more open systems, and the
popularity of the Macintosh in Japan, called for offering Apple's PCs in its
systems.
