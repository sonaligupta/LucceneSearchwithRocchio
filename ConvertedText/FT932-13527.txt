FT  22 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: Barclays' US issue raised to
Dollars 500m


   By RICHARD WATERS


BARCLAYS, the UK clearing bank, yesterday increased to Dollars 500m from
Dollars 300m the amount it is raising in the US through an innovative issue
of convertible capital, following strong demand from retail and
institutional investors.
The fixed-rate notes count as tier two capital for regulatory purposes, but
are convertible into non-cumulative preference shares, which count as tier
one capital, at the bank's option.
Strong demand for the bonds, which carry an 8 per cent coupon, was accounted
for by the premium they offered over US Treasuries. If converted, the bonds
would yield 9.25 per cent inclusive of advance corporation tax in the UK,
leaving US tax-paying investors with a net yield of just below 8 per cent,
Barclays said.
