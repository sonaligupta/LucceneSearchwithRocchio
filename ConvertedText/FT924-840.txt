FT  22 DEC 92 / 'Insider' warning


PROPOSED legislation on insider dealing will obstruct the stock market, the
100 Group of leading UK company finance directors warned yesterday.
The group has warned government officials that the restrictions will inhibit
normal discussions between companies and their analysts and institutional
shareholders, making the stock market less informed, less efficient and less
liquid.
