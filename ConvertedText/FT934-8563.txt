When parents try to persuade a child to enter into the spirit of some
forthcoming 'treat' such as a visit to Auntie they say 'You know you'll like
it once you're there'. But the more insistent they become, the further out
the child's bottom lip protrudes. I feel much the same about series such as
Wild Palms (BBC2, 9.00) which, according to the promoters' endless hype, is
even more weird and addictive than 'Twin Peaks'. The more they go on about
it the more I want to say 'No, won't watch'. It is, of course, American, it
seeks to develop a cult, James Belushi and Angie Dickinson star, and Oliver
Stone is co-producer. You get 90 minutes tonight, 45 tomorrow, and then it
continues on Tuesdays.
C4 also starts another new American series: Homicide: Life On The Street
(10.00) which follows the fortunes of a police murder squad. Hasn't that
been done before? In Panorama (BBC1, 9.30), environment correspondent Ian
Breach reports on the building of Thorp, a 'nuclear laundry' which the
government is expected to approve this week, though there seem to be doubts
about whether it is needed.
