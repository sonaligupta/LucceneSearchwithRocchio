FT  08 NOV 94 / International Company News: Investors offered a slice of HK
film empire

Mr Raymond Chow, one of the founders of the Hong Kong film industry, will
take part of his movie empire public this week when he offers 125m shares in
Golden Harvest Entertainment (Holdings).
The stock is priced at HKDollars 1.93 a share, which gives a prospective
price/earnings ratio of 10.39 times, on a fully diluted basis. The issue
will raise HKDollars 241.25m (USDollars 31.3m) gross and HKDollars 225m
after expenses. The issue is managed by Wardley Corporate Finance and
PruAsia DBS.
In the year to the end of June the company had profits after tax of
HKDollars 69.2m, on turnover of HKDollars 361.7m. Directors forecast profits
of at least HKDollars 90m in the current year.
Golden Harvest Entertainment will own Mr Chow's cinemas, distribution
businesses and film processing business. His film production business, his
biggest asset, has been kept private.
The company is one of the main distributors of Chinese-and English-language
films in Hong Kong, with a 27 per cent and 38 per cent market share,
respectively. The company is also an important distributor of films in
Singapore and Malaysia, and in Thailand it operates two multiplex cinemas.
The company said HKDollars 70m of the capital raised would be used to repay
bank debt. The remainder would be used to expand its cinemas in Hong Kong
and south-east Asia.
