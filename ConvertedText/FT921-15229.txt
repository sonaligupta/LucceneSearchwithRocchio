FT  11 JAN 92 / Finance & The Family: FSAVCs vs. company schemes


Once you have decided to put money into an AVC, you still have to choose
between FSAVCs and a company scheme.
There are no straightforward rules on which will be better for you. The
differences are as follows:
The provider of an in-house scheme is chosen by the employer while the
employee can choose the provider for an FSAVC.
The costs of an in-house scheme can be borne by either the employer or the
employee, although the employer should usually be able to negotiate
discounts. You will certainly bear the full costs of an FSAVC yourself.
Tax relief on in-house contributions is paid immediately at the highest
marginal rate. The relief on FSAVCs is less convenient for top-rate
taxpayers. Contributions are paid net of basic rate tax, which the provider
then reclaims. Top-rate tax relief must be claimed in end-of-year tax
returns.
Contributions into an in-house scheme often remain fixed, and employers can
delay a change in contribution rates for up to 12 months. If you have an
FSAVC, terms vary according to the provider, but they should usually be much
more flexible. Investment options on an in-house scheme are chosen by the
employer. With an FSAVC, it is up to you.
In short, FSAVCs offer much more flexibility and choice, in return for
higher charges and possibly more awkward administration.
