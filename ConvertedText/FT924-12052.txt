FT  22 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Outlook on wool prices remains
gloomy


   By REUTER


   WELLINGTON


The outlook for wool prices remains gloomy in the short term but is positive
in the long term, according to Mr Pat Morrison, chairman of the New Zealand
Wool Board, reports Reuter from Wellington.
In a speech to Federated Farmers he said he was less confident about the
short term than he was six months ago.
The world market has recovered slightly from the 45-year low of a year ago
but is still at historically low levels.
The only bright spot has been the return of China to the market - last
season it bought more than a fifth of New Zealand's wool exports.
Russia, traditionally the world's biggest wool importer and one of New
Zealand's main customers, wants wool but remains side-lined because of its
inability to pay for it.
