FT  08 NOV 94 / Technology: Overloaded on the Internet - Technically
Speaking


   By TOM FOREMSKI


The popular science fiction author Stanislaw Lem wrote a short comic story
about an intergalactic pirate who is obsessed with adding to his store of
information. Pirate Pugg kidnaps space travellers and forces them to tell
him everything they know. He is finally defeated by a contraption that spews
out all kinds of detailed but unimportant information such as how many sizes
of bedroom slippers are available on the continent of Cob.
Pirate Pugg is unable to tear himself away from the growing mountain of
information in case he comes across the answer to the 'Ultimate Mystery of
Being'.
Sometimes when I'm roaming the Internet, I feel like Pirate Pugg. There is
an incredible amount of information available through the Internet but
finding something useful is a frustrating experience.
The Internet allows you to access information on tens of millions of
computers worldwide, and brings the prospect of a global repository of
knowledge, mostly free. Users, or surfers as they like to be called, can
access huge amounts of information. There are hundreds of millions of
plain-text articles accessible on a huge variety of topics.
Newsletters and magazines of various kinds are proliferating on the Internet
since it is the cheapest way to publish. There are no printing costs, and
almost no mailing costs. The beauty of digital technology is that the
digital text can be duplicated virtually for nothing.
While putting information out on to the Internet is easy, the problem is
finding the right piece of information when you need it. And here is where
we need new technologies to help us sift huge amounts of information.
Strictly speaking, we should not call it information until we have processed
it ourselves. Until it informs us about something we were looking for.
Everything on the Internet should be considered as data of one kind or
another - it becomes information when we have turned that data into a useful
form.
But finding a specific piece of data can be a mammoth chore. Formulating a
vaguely phrased search can return an enormous amount of leads. Such searches
are normally based on the presence of specific key words in millions of
documents.
Sending out a more detailed search request narrows the choices but here is
where the problem lies. Often, a narrow search will non find a relevant and
possibly more useful document because it does not contain the keywords or
contains them in a low number.
What is needed are specific tools that can carry out searches with a certain
amount of artificial intelligence - an approach that takes into account the
less focused aspects of conducting searches. Such tools are the key to
unlocking the potential of the Internet.
While many Internet enthusiasts champion the egalitarian culture of the
Internet, where many people throw information into a collective repository
without concern for payment, there is as yet little evidence to show how
useful it is to have access to this huge pool of information.
For example, when Gutenberg invented the printing press, it helped generate
an information explosion since books could be produced more quickly and more
cheaply than ever before.
This resulted in the flowering of the Renaissance and the rediscovery of
ancient Greek, Roman and Arabic texts that led to establishing modern
science and accelerated the move away from feudal societies.
Will the Internet and future information superhighways result in a similar
impact on society? Or are we already in information overload and unable to
effectively process the information we have access to?
My suspicion is that the latter is true. Many of us seek and hoard
information like Lem's Pirate Pugg but we are often unable to fully make use
of it in a meaningful way.
