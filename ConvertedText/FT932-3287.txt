FT  15 JUN 93 / Letter: Social provisions must be preserved


   From Ms CAROLE TONGUE MEP


Sir, Your article 'Japan car workers top of earnings league in world motor
industry' (June 10), paints a rosy picture of the Japanese car worker's
condition. It ignores, though, the now oft-documented stress and ill health
their long working hours produce.
Without actually saying so, the article hints that Europe's social
provisions (particularly good wages and moderate working hours), should be
sacrificed in the name of increased competitiveness. This attitude is
increasingly souring relations with Britain's European neighbours, who
rightly feel social justice and economic prosperity go hand in hand and
resent the attempt of the UK government to create a competitive labour
market on the basis of low wages and poor working conditions.
There should be no suggestion that Europeans should go back on their social
achievements. We should be calling for our main competitors to adopt similar
policies to improve the living and working conditions of their working
people, particularly shorter worker hours to achieve an enhanced quality of
life and increased employment opportunities.
