FT  04 AUG 92 / UK Company News: TDG static at Pounds 16.8m but shares rise
12p


   By PEGGY HOLLINGER


LOWER interest charges fuelled a marginal increase in interim profits at
Transport Development Group, Britain's second largest haulier, from Pounds
16.5m to Pounds 16.8m.
The pre-tax result was struck on turnover 9 per cent down to Pounds 267.2m
for the six months to June 30. Operating profits were flat at Pounds 18.9m.
The interim dividend is being maintained at 3p, while earnings per share
rose from 7.46p to 7.51p.
Sir James Duncan, who retires as chairman at the end of this month, said the
results were 'alright', neither sparkling nor disastrous. 'The balance sheet
is very strong and that is the way we would want it.'
A strict control of cash had helped the company cut net debt from Pounds
63.7m to Pounds 40.4m. As a result, interest charges fell by Pounds 300,000
to Pounds 2.1m.
Sir James said recession continued to affect the group as severely as ever.
'We keep looking for the sunrise but it is not happening yet,' he said.
France, in particular, had suffered from economic downturn.
The French business incurred a loss of Pounds 537,000 in the first half,
compared with a profit of Pounds 1.9m. Management had been changed and steps
to reduce losses, such as depot closures, were being taken.
Holland marginally increased profits from Pounds 2.3m to Pounds 2.5m,
despite intense competition.
In the UK, overall trading profits were 10 per cent ahead at Pounds 14.2m
with solid increases recorded by hire, storage and transport. Redundancy
costs depressed profits of the UK distribution business from Pounds 4.8m to
Pounds 4.3m. Redundancy costs for the group overall came to Pounds 1.6m
(Pounds 800,000).
Willig Freight Lines, the US business earmarked for disposal, incurred
pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.1m in the first half. These were set off against
the Pounds 15m extraordinary provision made at the end of last year. Sir
James said the company was in negotiations over a sale with two potential
purchasers.
COMMENT
Sir James's modest success was applauded by the market last night with the
shares rising from 216p to 228p. The restructuring begun by the company
before the recession appears to be feeding through. However, there's more
work to do, with the biggest question mark hanging over Willig Freight.
France, too, will take time to sort out. Yet the main problem for TDG
remains the global economy and there is not a lot that Sir James can do
there. Forecasts are for Pounds 40m pre-tax this year. Although the multiple
of 12.7 times may look undemanding, the shares are not likely to take off
until some sign of recovery becomes apparent. Better to hold and wait for
the upturn.
