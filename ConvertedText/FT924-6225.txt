At least 16 people were killed and more than 200 injured in Mississippi,
Tennessee and Alabama after a series of tornadoes and storms ripped across
the southern US early yesterday, Reuter reports from Jackson.
The death toll exceeded that of Hurricane Andrew, which struck Florida and
Louisiana in late August and caused 13 deaths. Officials estimated damage
will be in the millions and thousands of residents from Texas to Georgia
were without power.
