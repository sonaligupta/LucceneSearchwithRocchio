FT  23 APR 93 / Observer: Buba's boob?


Has the Bundesbank finally over-reached itself in its desire to spring
surprises on the market?
Not content with wrong-footing many dealers by nudging interest rates down
yesterday just when poor money supply numbers suggested the central bankers
would once again stay their hands, the Buba communications people
perpetrated what was either a notable cock-up - or else a distinctly dirty
trick.
Initially handing out a press release confined to detailing the annual
profits, several wire services assumed no change in interest rate policy and
broadcast as much to the world, only to have to revise it five minutes later
on the arrival of a second release.
