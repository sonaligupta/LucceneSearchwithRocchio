FT  20 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets: S Africa golds under pressure


Johannesburg ended generally lower as the recent firmer trend ran out of
steam and foreign demand dried up. Gold shares tracked the softer bullion
price and dealers said the metal needed to put in a strong showing to
attract renewed investor interest.
The overall index receded 39 to 5,549, industrials dipped 41 to 6,357 and
golds fell 61, or 2.8 per cent, to 2,095. De Beers finished R1 down at R108,
Anglos was 50 cents softer at R232.50 and Anglovaal fell R2 to R133.
Gencor was 10 cents easier at R11.80 as investors awaited news of its bid
for parts of the Billiton group. Iscor slipped a cent to R4.
