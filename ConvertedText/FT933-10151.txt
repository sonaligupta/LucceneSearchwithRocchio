FT  05 AUG 93 / International Company News: General Re advances to Dollars
183m


   By PATRICK HARVERSON


GENERAL Reinsurance, the largest US reinsurer, recorded second-quarter net
income of Dollars 183.8m, or Dollars 2.14 a share, up from Dollars 158.5m,
or Dollars 1.80, a year ago.
The growth in General Re's earnings stemmed from lower claims and expenses,
an improvement in the company's underwriting results, and a modest rise in
investment income. The strong second quarter took the Connecticut-based
reinsurer's six-month earnings to Dollars 344.4m, down from the Dollars
366.3m recorded in the first half of 1992.
Last year's six-monthly results, however, were boosted by a one-off gain of
Dollars 61m from an accounting adjustment.
General Re's worldwide net premium volume in the quarter climbed 3.2 per
cent to Dollars 588.4m, due primarily to a 42 per cent jump in international
reinsurance premium volume. Net investment income totalled Dollars 193.8m
over the three months, up from Dollars 187.9m a year ago.
Total revenues reached Dollars 843.4m, up from Dollars 829.2m in the second
quarter of 1992.
Claims and claim expenses totalled Dollars 397.4m, compared with Dollars
427.8m a year ago, and overall expenses shrank by 3.3 per cent to Dollars
608.4m.
