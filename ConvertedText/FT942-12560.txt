Japan's Management and Co-ordination Agency said the country's unemployment
rate in the year to March stood at 2.6 per cent, up 0.4 percentage points
from the previous year, and the highest level in seven years, news agencies
reported from Tokyo.
Meanwhile, housing starts fell for the first time in 22 months in March,
dropping 0.7 per cent from the year before to 118,852 units, the
construction ministry said.
In a separate report, the labour ministry said the ratio of job offers to
job seekers, an indicator of labour demand, fell last fiscal year to 0.71
from 1.0 in the previous year to March.
The figure means that were 71 jobs for every 100 people seeking employment.
In March, the jobless rate stayed flat from the previous month to a
seasonally-adjusted 2.9 per cent, but the agency indicated that the demand
for workers in some industries remains weak.
The decline in housing starts, which came in spite of a rise in starts on
owner-occupied homes and houses for sale, came from a decline in starts of
rental houses, the ministry said. In February, housing starts were up 6.3
per cent.
Starts on owner-occupied homes increased 2.9 per cent to 42,516, rising for
the 10th month in a row. Those on houses for rent declined 18.9 per cent to
43,258, falling for the second straight month.
In the year to the end of March, construction starts grew 6.3 per cent from
the year before to 1,509,787, rising for the second straight year.
Starts for owner-occupied homes rose 11.5 per cent from the previous year to
536,908, up for the second year in a row.
Construction of houses for rent declined 5.1 per cent to 651,563, showing a
turnaround from an 18.0 per cent rise in the previous year.
