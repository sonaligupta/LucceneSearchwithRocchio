FT  29 JUL 92 / International Company News: EC to seek Ecu500m in syndicated
loans market


   By SARA WEBB


THE European Community is poised to tap the international syndicated loans
market for the first time in nearly a decade with a three-year Ecu500m
(Dollars 675m) facility. The proceeds will finance imports of agricultural
and medical products by the republics which formerly made up the Soviet
Union.
The EC is expected to award the mandate to a European bank this week.
Deutsche Bank and National Westminster Bank are among those which have bid
for the position of lead manager, although Banque Nationale de Paris and
Societe Generale have been mentioned as contenders.
The EC traditionally prefers to borrow in the international bond markets -
where it can fund at below the London interbank offered rate (Libor) -
rather than the international syndicated loans market where pricing is much
higher.
An EC official stressed that in the case of funding exports to former Soviet
republics, the EC had chosen a syndicated loan 'because it gives us
flexibility to choose the date of drawing the funds.
'In this case we will need a lengthy draw-down period which would be
difficult to arrange with a bond where we would have to take the funds and
then be exposed to an interest rate risk.'
The EC last tapped the international syndicated loans market in 1983 with a
Dollars 1.24bn term loan. Last November it provided a guarantee for 98 per
cent of an Ecu500m loan to the Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs of the
USSR, arranged by Deutsche Bank.
The financing covered food exports from the EC to Russia and the margin was
50 basis points over Libor, with 'generous fees,' Deutsche Bank said.
However, bankers say the latest loan will be much more tightly priced given
that the actual borrower is the EC, a triple-A rated name which is zero-risk
weighted for capital adequacy purposes.
