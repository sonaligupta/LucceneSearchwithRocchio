FT  22 JUL 94 / Record UK exports outside EU underline recovery


   By GILLIAN TETT and JOHN GRIFFITHS


Record trade figures and strong car production data provided further
evidence yesterday that the UK economic recovery is spreading throughout the
industrial sector.
The Central Statistical Office said exports to countries outside the
European Union rose to record levels in the second quarter of this year, as
UK companies benefited from rising demand in the US and other economies.
Exports to non-EU countries - which represent almost half of all UK trade -
rose to a seasonally adjusted Pounds 15.57bn in the three months to June 30,
1.5 per cent higher than in the first quarter, and 10 per cent above the
same period of 1993.
Imports, by contrast, fell 1 per cent in the second quarter, from the first
quarter, resulting in a steady reduction in Britain's trade deficit with
non-EU countries to Pounds 495m in June, and Pounds 1.66bn in the second
quarter of the year.
The trade deficit figures were better than the City had expected, and
analysts said they showed Britain's recovery was expanding without yet
sucking in large quantities of imports.
The Treasury said it was 'encouraged' by the reduction in the trade deficit
and by strong car production data.
Motor industry statistics released yesterday show UK car production this
year may reach its highest level for 21 years thanks to an unexpectedly
strong market recovery in the UK and clear signs that continental Europe's
steepest sales slump for decades has ended.
The statistics, released jointly by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders and the CSO, show that total car output rose last month to 145,078,
nearly 8 per cent above the figure for June 1993.
Increasing economic activity in the UK is also reflected in a sharp rise in
commercial vehicle output. This leapt by 27.2 per cent, on a year-on-year
basis, to 21,328.
