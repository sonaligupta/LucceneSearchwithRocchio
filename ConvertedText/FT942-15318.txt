   MANILA


San Miguel, the Philippines' largest industrial enterprise, reported
unaudited net profits of 870m pesos (Dollars 31m) for the three months to
the end of March, an increase of 40 per cent over the year-ago figure,
writes Jose Galang in Manila.
The company said sales improved by 11 per cent, but gave no figures.
The beer and food group attributed the improved financial performance to the
economic recovery in the Philippines which, it said, was 'well under way'.
It said it was allocating a capital budget of 12bn pesos for domestic and
overseas projects during the year. It is pursuing beer brewery projects in
Vietnam and Nepal, according to officials.
