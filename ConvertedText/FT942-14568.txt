FT  20 APR 94 / World Trade News: Competitive China predicted


   By FRANCES WILLIAMS


   GENEVA


International business leaders believe China will rank among the world's
four most competitive economies in the year 2010, alongside those of the US,
Japan and Germany.
This is according to the Swiss-based International Institute for Management
Development and the World Economic Forum.
Selected results of its survey of 1,747 top executives around the world,
published today, show that the US and Japan are expected to head the
competitiveness league table early in the next century.
Germany is the only European nation among the predicted high performers,
with China followed by two other Asian nations, South Korea and Singapore.
The full results of the survey will be published in September as part of the
IMD/WEF annual World Competitiveness Report.
Business leaders regard the US and Japanese governments as most active in
promoting competitiveness, followed by those of Singapore. In Europe,
Germany and Switzerland are seen as having governments most supportive of
business.
Asked where they would ideally choose to live and work, nearly half the
executives put the US in their top three, regardless of where they lived
when responding. East Asians favoured Australia, while Europeans were more
attracted by Switzerland, France or Britain.
