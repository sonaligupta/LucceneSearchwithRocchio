FT  17 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zinc missing from statistics


   By KENNETH GOODING


NEARLY 100,000 tonnes of zinc cannot be accounted for by preliminary 1991
statistics drawn up by the International Lead and Zinc Study Group and some
of it is likely to show up in stocks early this year.
Already by mid-January London Metal Exchange stocks showed a rise of 6,000
tonnes and the ILZSG points out that this covered only Special High Grade
zinc and excluded any warehouse stocks of High Grade or GOB (Good Ordinary
Brand) metal, which go unreported.
The organisation also suggests that 'consumption in some countries may prove
to be slightly higher than the preliminary assessments when consolidated
annual data are fully complete'.
Preliminary figures indicate that zinc consumption last year fell by 58,000
tonnes or 1.1 per cent to 5.2m tonnes while both mine and refined metal
output advanced to new records: mine production was up by 127,000 tonnes or
2.4 per cent to 5.473m while refined metal moved up by 113,000 tonnes or 2.2
per cent to 5.298m tonnes.
Zinc supply was again swollen by large exports to the west from the former
eastern bloc countries. Net exports rose from 39,000 tonnes in 1990 to
80,000 tonnes.
Taking this into account, total apparent supply exceeded consumption by
about 170,000 to 180,000 tonnes. In 1990 there was a supply deficit of
68,000 tonnes.
However, compared with the indicated supply surplus of at least 170,000
tonnes last year, reported stocks at the end of 1991 were up by only 74,000
tonnes to 624,000 tonnes. The ILZSG is now start trawling through the
statistics for the 'missing' tonnage.
