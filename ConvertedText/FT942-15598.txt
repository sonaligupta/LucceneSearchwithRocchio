FT  14 APR 94 / UK Company News: British Land acquires business park


British Land is acquiring Barwell Business Park in Chessington, Surrey, for
a total Pounds 19.2m and the investment will be offered to the BL Quantum
Property Fund, the joint venture that British Land set up with Mr George
Soros' Quantum Fund last summer.
The consideration is to be satisfied by some Pounds 2m cash and the balance
by the issue of 4.1m new British Land ordinary shares at 420p each.
The 26-acre park comprises 343,000 sq ft of new industrial and warehouse
buildings and a further 44,000 sq ft currently occupied by the Property
Service Agency. The rent roll is about Pounds 2.8m a year and the average
lease length is 19 years.
