FT  30 APR 94 / UK Company News: JJB (Sports) Pounds 20m flotation


   By PAUL TAYLOR


JJB (Sports), Britain's biggest independent sports retailer, is coming to
market during the summer via a placing with institutional investors, which
is likely to value the group at about Pounds 50m.
The group, formed 21 years ago by Mr David Whelan, the former Blackburn
Rovers player who broke his leg in the 1960 FA cup final against
Wolverhampton Wanderers, plans to raise between Pounds 15m and Pounds 20m of
new money through the flotation.
Mr Whelan, the chairman, who entered the retail sector using the Pounds 400
compensation he received after breaking his leg to buy a market stall in
Wigan, said yesterday that the new money would be used to fund further
domestic expansion.
JJB has grown from a single sports shop in Wigan into a sports chain with
operating profits last year of about Pounds 4.5m on turnover of Pounds 43m
and 107 stores across the UK, mainly in the north west of England, the
Midlands and Scotland. All the stores are supplied from a three year old
distribution centre near Wigan.
The group has targeted towns with more than a 50,000 population for
expansion; there are about 400 in Britain. 'We believe the sports goods
market offers many opportunities for further growth and we hope to take
maximum advantage of them', said Mr Whelan yesterday.
Charterhouse Tilney Securities are the sponsors and stockbrokers to the
issue.
