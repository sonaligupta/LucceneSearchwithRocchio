FT  07 JAN 94 / Paris moves to open up savings sector


   By ALICE RAWSTHORN


Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French economy minister, yesterday confirmed that
he plans to table legislation for a radical reform of the Caisse des Depots
et Consignations, the state-controlled savings institution, writes Alice
Rawsthorn.
The reform of the Caisse des Depots, an idiosyncratic institution which
dominates the French savings system and is involved with public sector
funding, has been mooted since the conservatives came to office.
France's banks have lobbied for it to be dismantled in order to open up the
savings market. Mr Alphandery said he feltthat its public sector interests
and competitive activities should be separated.
