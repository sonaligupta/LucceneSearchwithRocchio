FT  12 MAR 93 / International Company News: Rights issue ruled out at RTZ

RTZ Corporation, the world's largest mining company, yesterday ruled out a
rights issue to finance its move into the US coal industry. Sir Derek
Birkin, chairman, reporting results for 1992 which showed a flat
performance, said 'there is no question of us looking for a rights issue'.
RTZ is paying Dollars 1.3bn for two companies, Nerco and Cordero Mining,
which will take gearing to about 63 per cent. Sir Derek said the group was
comfortable with this gearing, which RTZ aimed to cut by selling Nerco's oil
and gas and minerals assets.
He said the underlying result in 1992 was 'resilient in a very difficult
year'. However, he warned RTZ was not 'sanguine about an early or pronounced
upturn in metal prices'. RTZ's shares fell 13p to 675p.
Mr Robert Wilson, chief executive, said there had been some further
weakening of prices so far this year. That prompted an unchanged 13.5p final
dividend, to give a same-again total of 19.5p.
The group has adopted FRS 3. Although pre-tax profits rose 23.4 per cent
from Pounds 435m to Pounds 537m, Mr Wilson said a 1 per cent increase in
adjusted earnings - excluding exceptional items and discontinued activities
 -from Pounds 344m to Pounds 348m, was 'the most meaningful reflection of
the performance of the business'. He said that on average metal prices fell
2 per cent in the year and demand was 'a bit' lower.
Turnover fell 5.6 per cent to Pounds 4.6bn, and operating profits declined
14.7 per cent to Pounds 370m, before associate profits rose 11.8 per cent to
Pounds 274m. Exceptional charges totalled Pounds 93m, down from Pounds 201m.
After a higher tax rate, earnings were Pounds 249m, up 21.5 per cent. On the
old accounting rules, earnings were 2.6 per cent higher at Pounds 316m.
Reported earnings per share were 24.8p compared with 20.7p last year.
