FT  06 NOV 93 / Italy plans secret service reforms


   By REUTER


   ROME


ITALY'S cabinet yesterday approved sweeping reform of the scandal-tainted
secret services as graft allegations by former agents shook financial
markets, Reuter reports from Rome.
Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi plans to merge the civil and military
secret services into a slimmer, more transparent and accountable body, his
office said in a statement.
A bill creating the National Agency for Information and State Security will
go before parliament this month and is expected to be passed by the end of
December, political sources said.
Allegations by jailed agents that senior figures including President Oscar
Luigi Scalfaro plundered funds earmarked for covert operations have revived
fears of a plot to destabilise the country and delay elections.
