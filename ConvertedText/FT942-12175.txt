FT  30 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Small saver hints - Saye


   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU


Small savers are usually hard done by when it comes to interest rate levels,
with institutions paying the highest rates to those with the largest sums of
money, as the Moneyfacts table (right) shows.
However, small savers can earn up to 8.62 per cent annually and tax-free to
boot through the government's save-as-you-earn scheme.
This is a five-year tax-free scheme with a minimum monthly saving of Pounds
1 to a maximum of only Pounds 20 a month, or Pounds 1,200 maximum. The bonus
paid at the end of five years is equivalent to an annual return of 8.3 per
cent; if the money is left for another two years, it is 8.62 per cent.
These figures gross up to 13.8 per cent and 14.4 per cent for a higher-rate
taxpayer or 11.1 per cent and 11.5 per cent for a lower-rate taxpayer.
Early withdrawals are allowed but no interest is paid for withdrawals in the
first year; the rate is 6 per cent thereafter. You can only have one SAYE
contract at a time.
The only bank to operate the scheme is Abbey National. The building
societies are: Alliance & Leicester, Bradford & Bingley, Bristol & West,
Britannia, Buckinghamshire, Cambridge, Chesham, Cheshire, Chorley &
District, Derbyshire, Dudley, Earl Shilton, Furness, Halifax, Harpenden,
Leeds & Holbeck, Leek United, Marsden, Mercantile, Newbury, Newcastle, North
of England, Principality (from Tuesday), Scottish, Vernon and Yorkshire.
