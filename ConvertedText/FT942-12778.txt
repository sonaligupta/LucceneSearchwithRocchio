FT  28 APR 94 / Trial of Lloyd's brokers dropped


The prosecution of two brokers at the Lloyd's of London insurance market
charged with conspiring to defraud their own insurance company was abandoned
yesterday, seven days into their trial.
Mr Michael Crotaz and Mr Victor Chapman, both former directors of Walter F.
Smith and Co, were formally acquitted of charges of conspiracy to defraud
and conspiring to falsify accounts by the jury at Inner London Crown Court.
The prosecution had alleged that the two men - arrested last March - had
falsely credited about Pounds 100,000 to the company's brokerage accounts
when it should have been paid to others. It alleged they had diverted money
from their company's account to their personal accounts.
The Crown Prosecution Service abandoned its case after defence lawyers had
cross-examined the second of 19 scheduled witnesses.
Mr John Mitchell their solicitor, said afterwards: 'This prosecution should
never have been brought - as the outcome shows.'
