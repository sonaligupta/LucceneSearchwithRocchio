FT  12 NOV 92 / Letter: Education in need of fewer new initiatives and more
stability


   From Mr SERGE LOURIE


Sir, Andrew Adonis is correct to warn that the new Education Bill could
reduce the independence of state schools ('Classroom reform fails the
freedom test', November 9).
As chairman of the governing body of a comprehensive school in the London
Borough of Richmond, I have watched a never-ending stream of government
initiatives, many inconsistent or contradictory, creating enormous amounts
of work for teachers at the cost of preventing them from concentrating on
teaching.
We have taken responsibility for a devolved budget of more than Pounds 2m
and made major improvements at the school, proving that local management for
schools (LMS) works. However, the governing body remains very suspicious of
opting out to grant maintained status (GMS) because of the many
imponderables. We have always received a good service from the local
education authority and would be reluctant to change, especially because of
the lack of clarity of what GMS actually means.
There are two main areas of concern, one organisational and one financial.
Clearly the proposed funding agency will consist of unelected officials who
will be difficult to influence. There would well be a centralised
bureaucracy like the Department of Education which will be remote.
The financial difficulties are also significant as there is no way in which
the level of education spending nationally is going to be increased and the
bribes being offered to opting out schools cannot be sustained.
What schools now need is a period of stability rather than the constant
change of the past five years.
