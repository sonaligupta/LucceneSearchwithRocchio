FT  11 MAR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Coffee price rally stalled -
Market report


   By REUTER


COFFEE chalked up fresh three month highs at the London Commodity Exchange
yesterday and held on to most of their gains. But traders said prices seemed
to have stalled at predicted resistance.
The May futures position closed at Dollars 1,280 a tonne, up Dollars 20,
after being pushed to Dollars 1,285 earlier by trade buying and speculative
interest.
London Metal Exchange dealers said ALUMINIUM and COPPER prices finished
nicely positioned to build on stability and push higher. Three months
delivery Copper ended after hours 'kerb' trading unchanged on the day at
Dollars 1,906 after declines below Dollars 1,900 had failed to trigger
stop-loss selling. Three months ALUMINIUM also came through a test of
underlying support, ending at Dollars 1,285 a tonne, up Dollars 6, after
dipping earlier towards the downside chart point between Dollars 1,270 and
Dollars 1,275.
The London GOLD price built on Wednesday's rally, with 'quite aggressive'
physical buying lifting it Dollars 5.45 to Dollars 385 a troy ounce, dealers
said. The main impetus again came from investment fund buying at the New
York Commodity Exchange, where traders cited South African election worries
and the Whitewater affair among possible influences.
