FT  24 AUG 92 / Women's prison terms attacked


A THIRD of women sent to prison have no previous convictions, compared with
11 per cent of men, according to figures from the National Association for
the Care and Resettlement of Offenders.
Ms Vivien Stern, Nacro director, said: 'Far too many women with few or no
previous convictions are unnecessarily imprisoned for non-violent offences,
often with devastating effects on their families.'
