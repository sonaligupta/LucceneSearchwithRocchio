FT  17 JAN 92 / International Company News: Anglo American mines earn more


   By PHILIP GAWITH

COST containment and forward selling helped the gold mines in the Anglo
American group, the world's largest gold producer, record a 13 per cent
increase in distributable profits to R183.3m (Dollars 65.6m) in the December
quarter.
The rise in profits came despite serious labour unrest during November at
the President Steyn mine in the Free State.
Mr Lionel Hewitt, managing director of the gold and uranium division, said
the bottom-line cost to Freegold, the umbrella company for the group's Free
State operations, had been about R7m.
Production during the quarter dropped to 27,513kg from 28,185kg, but the
mine was able to increase distributable profits by 6.4 per cent to R73.2m.
Vaal Reefs had a successful quarter, with distributable profits up by 29.6
per cent to R64.4m. Gold production was virtually unchanged at 18,443kg, but
total working costs declined by 6 per cent to R426.3m.
Western Deep Levels failed to repeat the exceptional performance of the
September quarter, with distributable profit dropping to R25.6m from R32.2m.
It was hit by a drop in gold production, to 10,061kg from 10,404kg, unit
working costs rising by 3 per cent to R24,245 per kg, and a slightly lower
gold price received.
Of the other mines, Elandsrand had a good quarter, lifting gold production
by 6.3 per cent to 3,857kg. Distributable profit nearly doubled to R12.2m.
Ergo, the dump treatment operation, lifted distributable profit 67 per cent
to R7m.
