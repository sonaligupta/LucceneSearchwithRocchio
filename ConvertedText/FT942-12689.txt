FT  28 APR 94 / UK Company News: Interconnect purchase boosts Securicor
communications side


   By PAUL TAYLOR


Securicor, the security, parcels and communications group, has further
strengthened its communications division through the acquisition of
Interconnect, a small supplier of advanced telecommunications equipment.
Securicor declined to reveal the purchase price. But Mr Ed Hough, Securicor
Communications's chief executive, said the acquisition was 'a key move in
our strategic plan to become a leading supplier in the international
business communications sector'.
Interconnect, which is being merged with the Securicor Telecoms subsidiary,
is a recognised leader in the field of open telephone systems which allow
the easier integration of personal computer Local Area Networks and
telephone systems.
Unlike proprietary systems, open systems equipment is designed to
international standards.
Open systems telephony is expected to be one of the fastest growing
telecommunications equipment markets in the 1990s.
Interconnect's 3000 Digital Hybrid switch is Europe's first open system
Private Automatic Branch Exchange and the acquisition will significantly
strengthen Securicor Telecom's position in the emerging market.
