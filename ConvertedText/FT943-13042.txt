FT  21 JUL 94 / Cash for questions probe veto fails


   By IVOR OWEN


Labour backbenchers failed in the Commons last night in their attempt to
ensure that the parliamentary inquiry into the 'cash for questions' affair
is conducted solely by MPs with no outside business interests, Ivor Owen
writes.
They selected Sir Marcus Fox, the chairman of the Conservative backbench
1922 committee, who holds seven directorships and a number of consultancies,
as a token target. But their attempt to exclude him from the privileges
committee which is to examine the issue was defeated by a majority of 115
(158-43).
A motion appointing nine Conservative MPs, seven Labour MPs, and one Liberal
Democrat to serve on the committee was approved by a majority of 128
(151-23).
It will investigate the action of Mr Graham Riddick, Tory MP for Colne
Valley, and Mr David Tredinnick, Conservative MP for Bosworth, in agreeing
to accept payments of Pounds 1,000 to table parliamentary questions, and
whether they were subject to entrapment by The Sunday Times.
