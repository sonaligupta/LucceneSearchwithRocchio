FT  16 JUN 93 / Nigeria vote rigging claim


   By REUTER


   LAGOS


THE party trailing in Nigeria's presidential election, the National
Republican Convention (NRC), has alleged rigging and called for fresh
voting, Reuter reports from Lagos.
Meanwhile, Mr Arthur Nzeribe, a millionaire behind the Association for a
Better Nigeria which wants military rule extended, said it had won a court
order barring the electoral commission (NEC) from announcing the result of
Saturday's poll.
On Thursday, the group had won a temporary injunction to delay the poll, but
this was over-ruled by the NEC.
The contest was between two millionaire Moslem businessmen, Mr Moshood
Abiola of the Social Democratic party, whose predictions of clear victory
have been borne out by results so far, and Mr Bashir Tofa of the NRC.
