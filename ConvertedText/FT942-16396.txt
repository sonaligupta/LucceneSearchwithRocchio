FT  11 APR 94 / Managers' pay rises 'lowest since 1975'


   By IAN WHEELER


Management pay rises have averaged only 2.8 per cent during the past 12
months, the lowest level recorded by The Reward Group pay analysts since
1975.
In its survey of management salaries, Reward said the average figure for the
past four months was down to 2.3 per cent.
The figures, based on 19,864 job recordings, put managers about 0.1 per cent
behind clerical and operative staff for the past four months, but slightly
ahead for the year as a whole.
Mr Steve Flather, managing director of Reward, said the survey 'confirmed
the continuing low level of pay increases for management'. He predicted that
low inflation and high unemployment would mean that 'there is unlikely to be
a wage explosion in the short term'.
Reward is expecting data for the next 12 months to show a healthier
increase. It forecasts a rise of about 3.2 per cent for the next year.
Reward also reports that London is the highest paying region and the west
Midlands the lowest, while Scotland defies the north-south comparison by
being the third highest paying area.
The survey shows that the energy sector provides the highest comparative pay
levels, with metal-goods manufacture the lowest.
