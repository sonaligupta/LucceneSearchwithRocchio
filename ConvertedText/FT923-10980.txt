FT  28 JUL 92 / Mexico to reject US aid for drug fight


   By DAMIAN FRASER


   MEXICO CITY


THE Mexican government will no longer accept aid from the US to combat drug
trafficking, according to Mr Ignacio Morales Lechuga, the attorney-general.
Aid would be refused from this month, he said.
The move seems to be in retaliation for the US Supreme Court ruling in June
upholding the kidnapping of the Mexican murder suspect, Dr Humberto Alvarez
Machain, by agents working for the US Drug Enforcement Agency.
Mr Morales Lechuga said of DEA activities in Mexico: 'If you are a guest in
a house you can't act like the host.'
The aid amounted to Dollars 48m (Pounds 25.1m) last fiscal year. The
attorney-general said in an interview with the New York Times that the
decision to refuse US money would not impede Mexico's fight against drug
traffickers.
The government continues to bridle at the refusal to return Dr Alvarez
Machain to Mexico for trial, and is seeking to amend the countries'
extradition treaty to make such kidnappings illegal.
Last week Mr Santiago Onate, attorney-general for environmental protection,
said that environmental co-operation between the US and Mexico had been made
more difficult by the Supreme Court ruling and, by implication, Washington's
refusal to return Dr Alvarez Machain. The Mexicans may not allow joint
inspections of border factories, or joint settlement of environmental
disputes.
Mexico had originally said after the Court ruling that it would suspend
activities of the DEA, but a day later it reversed its decision. The U-turn
has been explained in some quarters by the Mexican government's fear of
upsetting US legislators while North American free-trade agreement (Nafta)
talks enter their most critical stage.
