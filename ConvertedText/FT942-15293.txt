FT  15 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bundesbank rate cuts fails to
give bourses a lift


   By Our Markets Staff


An unexpected cut in discount rate from the Bundesbank did battle yesterday
with falling bond prices in Europe and the US, and the bond prices won,
writes Our Markets Staff.
Mr Joe Rooney, European equity strategist at Lehman Brothers in London, said
that the cuts were too little, and came too late to help bourses which saw
them, responded momentarily and then waited for New York to open.
Sentiment was then shaken by a story that Iraq had shot down two US
helicopters; the later news that they might have been shot down, by mistake,
by US fighters did little to improve matters.
However, said Mr Rooney, Lehman was still happier about bourse prospects
than it was at the turn of the year: 'A number of risks,' he said, 'have
been removed.'
Long bond yields have risen, he said, but faster than the brokers expected;
Lehman now expects them to decouple from their US counterparts, helped by
falling inflation in countries like Germany. Further, cross-border selling
of European equities this year suggests that many of the aggressive
positions taken at the end of last year have been unwound.
FRANKFURT's Dax index, weak ahead of the Buba news, recovered a token 4
points on the interest rate cuts and then lost them again. The lead
indicator closed the session 10.48 down at 2,198.71, and ended the afternoon
a mere fraction lower again, at 2,198.24.
German bunds reported profit-taking after the Buba cuts, and were hit by
falling US treasuries when the Iraq helicopter story appeared. Equities,
said traders, had no option but to follow suit.
Turnover rose from DM8.3bn to DM9.5bn. Banks were preoccupied once again
with the potential collapse of the Jurgen Schneider property empire, and the
repercussions on their loan loss ratios.
Deutsche Bank, said to be the biggest lender to the company, fell another
DM12.70 to DM782.80; yet Commerzbank, thought to have relatively little
exposure, dropped proportionately more, by DM7.50 to DM353. The sector as a
whole was weak, and construction stocks also seemed affected with Bilfinger
& Berger down DM26 at DM859, and Holzmann DM35 lower at DM920.
Elsewhere, interest continued in special situations, with PWA up another DM7
to DM240, Kugelfischer by DM8 more to DM279 and Mannesmann and Thyssen, on
their diversification into the telephone business, by DM8.50 to DM460.50,
and DM4.50 to DM289 respectively.
PARIS slipped back after the German news; the market had already discounted
a cut, and had been hoping for somewhat more than was announced. The CAC-40
index saw a session low of 2,123.70, before closing off 13.31 to 2,139.05.
Taking a broader view Mr Andrew Shepherd-Barron of Kleinwort Benson in
London reiterated that his house had gone underweight in France at the
beginning of the month. One of the pressures on the market, he added was the
recent flow of convertible bonds, rights issues and placings which had been
taking money away from equities.
However, he maintained a positive outlook over the longer term, as corporate
earnings improved in line with the healthier economic picture.
Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez improved FFr8 to FFr573 after announcing a
satisfactory set of 1993 results, and a FFr1 rise in the dividend to FFr11.
AMSTERDAM concentrated on international stocks as the AEX index slipped 0.39
to 423.69, up from a session low of 420.72.
Internatio-Mueller, the transport and trading group, pleased the market with
1993 results and its forecast of a further improvement in the current year
and the shares put on Fl 5.50 to Fl 87.00.
One of the day's biggest rises was seen in Hagemeyer, the international
trading group, whose major shareholder is First Pacific of Hong Kong. The
shares gained Fl 7.20 to Fl 147, but traders said volume was thin.
ZURICH was unimpressed by its own, larger than expected, 50 basis point cut
in the discount rate to 3.50 per cent and the SMI index fell 34.0 to
2,843.7, near its low for the day.
Mr Frederick Hasslauer at Bank Sal Oppenheim said that the subdued response
to the rate cut was a further indication that Zurich had failed to decouple
from US trends.
At home, said Mr Hasslauer, investors were waiting for next Tuesday's 1993
results from Roche, which has held up better than most during the recent
correction. While few doubted that the figures would be good, there were
worries that investors might decide that the time has arrived to sell into
strength and switch into Germany. Roche certificates fell SFr90 to SFr7,045.
Among cyclicals, Sulzer fell SFr20 to SFr1,045 in spite of the group's
announcement that it expects increased profits in the current year.
MILAN resumed its advance as huge demand from individual domestic investors
swelled turnover to a record L2,206bn, adding to the capacity problems of
the bourse's already pressured electronic trading system. The Comit index
eased 1.64 to 787.12, although the real time Mibtel index registered a gain
over the session of 1.6 per cent.
Fiat propelled the market higher, rising L197 or 3.1 per cent to L6,500 amid
continuing speculation that the group plans a big asset sale or some other
corporate development. A L134 or 5.1 per cent rise to L2,787 by Cir was
attributed to the stock's recent underperformance. Olivetti added L118 or
4.3 per cent to L2,880.
MADRID added non-resident selling and the threat of political scandal to
broader concerns, and the general index fell 3.65 to 321.64. Mr Mariano
Rubio appears before congress today to answer questions concerning his
personal financial dealings while he governed the Bank of Spain.
WARSAW fell 6.7 per cent, but this was better than many analysts had been
expecting after the authorities suspended the 10 per cent price movement
limit on Tuesday for the following three sessions. The WIG index closed at a
provisional 9,980.4, as turnover tripled.
ISTANBUL rallied 6.5 per cent in heavy trade, adding to Wednesday's 2.6 per
cent gain. The composite index put on 1,344.86 to 22,104.32.
