FT  23 OCT 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (21):  A way to iron
out the market's bumps - Savings Schemes, It's known in the jargon as
'pound/cost averaging' - you buy more units when they are cheap and fewer
when they are dear / Survey of Unit Trusts


   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU


SAVINGS SCHEMES are a gentle way into unit trusts, likely to appeal to those
who want to dip their toes into equities or are unable to invest a large
lump sum.
The ability to build up savings cheaply and simply is one advantage; another
is that, by making payments on a regular basis, the investor is protecting
himself from stock market volatility.
A monthly contribution of Pounds 20 a month (the minimum for all schemes,
apart from Pounds 10 at Prosperity), might buy, for example, 20 units at
100p. However, if the unit price falls to 50p, you will buy 40 units.
Conversely, you would get only 10 units if the unit price rose to 200p.
In other words, you buy more units when they are cheap and fewer when they
are dear. This is known in the jargon as 'pound/cost averaging'. Of course,
if the market falls relentlessly, this is little consolation: you are still
losing money. But there is no point in investing if you think that prices
are going to fall for ever.
The unit trust industry has come to appreciate small savers since net new
sales fell in the wake of the 1987 crash - from Pounds 6.3bn that year to
Pounds 1.8bn in 1988. Regular savers proved more reliable than other
investors, and the guarantee of money coming in through the savings schemes
was a mitigating factor in performance after the crash, says Mintel, the
market research organisation.
The industry has since become far more interested in marketing through the
vehicle of personal equity plans (Peps - see page 21). Figures from the Unit
Trust Association show that virtually the only way to sell a unit trust
these days is on the back of a Pep.
The annual limit of Pounds 6,000 in a unit or investment trust Pep is the
equivalent of Pounds 500 a month in a savings scheme. If, therefore, you are
thinking of investing large sums regularly, you might consider doing so
through a savings scheme into a Pep, in order to benefit from capital gains
and income tax exemption. However, most companies stipulate a much higher
minimum for payments into a Pep than the Pounds 20 to Pounds 50 for ordinary
savings schemes.
Remember that, when times are good, you may be able to afford a higher
contribution to a regular savings scheme, but that if you do have to cut
back on personal expenditure, it becomes important to have the flexibility
of a savings scheme with an affordable minimum.
Most funds also expect you to build up a minimum amount through your
savings, usually Pounds 500 or Pounds 1,000; and if you are unable to do
this, you may be obliged to sell your units. It is therefore worth bearing
this in mind before committing yourself.
Meanwhile, as the tables show, the best performance of schemes over 15 years
has been more than double the best over 10 years - an indication of the
greater gains to be had over a longer period, combined with the compounding
effect of reinvesting income.
N&P has the singular achievement of showing the best results over both
periods, but only two other funds - James Capel Income and M&G Midland &
General - feature in both tables. Moreover, it is noticeable that the best
performers over 15 years have been in the UK market, particularly the UK
Equity Income sector. The picture is more mixed over the 10-year span,
because the unit trust industry vastly expanded its range in the 1980s.
But the tables underline the difficulty investors face in spotting a
potential high performer. Even if you had picked the best sector for the
15-year period, UK Equity Income, there was no guarantee that you would also
have hit upon the top-performing fund.
Over 10 years, Pounds 50 invested in N&P's UK Equity Income fund would have
turned a total investment of Pounds 6,000 into Pounds 15,735, a return of
over 150 per cent. However, few investors are likely to have picked the
winner, and the average unit trust's performance has been much weaker.
This is particularly true of the shorter-term performance of unit trusts,
hard hit by the crash. If you had invested in the average unit trust over
the five years ending August 1 this year, you would have incurred a loss,
turning Pounds 1,000 into Pounds 914, according to Money Management, the
monthly magazine for professional advisers.
So investing through a savings scheme is still not a guarantee of profit, or
of quick returns. But it does represent an alternative to the more
frequently marketed long-term savings instrument, the endowment policy.
Since a unit trust savings scheme is a pure investment contract - unlike an
endowment, which is a mixture of savings and life cover - the long-term
returns are likely to be higher. In terms of tax efficiency, a unit trust
Pep is superior. And the flexibility of a unit trust Pep - there are no
penalties for early surrender - offers a clear advantage over an endowment.
