FT  22 OCT 94 / Briefcase, Q&A: No tax on money gifts


My question concerns inheritance and capital gains tax. Can my husband and I
give our children money now - to buy better houses, cars etc - without
paying more tax?
He says any money spent like this is liable for tax but common sense tells
me this cannot be true. After all, it is our money and tax was paid when it
was earned.
If you give shares etc to your children, you will be liable to pay CGT as
though you had sold them to the children at market value. But there will be
no CGT on gifts of money (sterling). In either case, though, there could be
an IHT liability if you were to die within the following seven years.
Ask your tax office for the free pamphlets CGT14 (Capital gains tax: an
introduction) and IR45 (What happens when someone dies).
We take it all your children are over 18. If not, their income from any
gifts could be taxable as though it were your own.
No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the
answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as
soon as possible.
