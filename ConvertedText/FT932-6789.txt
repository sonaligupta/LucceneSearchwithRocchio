FT  27 MAY 93 / Congress cuts aid budget by Dollars 1.4bn


   By GEORGE GRAHAM


   WASHINGTON


THE US Congress has slashed its aid budget for next year to accommodate the
Dollars 1.8bn (Pounds 1.16bn) that President Bill Clinton has promised to
Russia and republics of the former Soviet Union, George Graham writes from
Washington.
Congressman David Obey, chairman of the House of Representatives' committee
in charge of foreign aid spending said it was 'not a pleasant job'. He
reduced the total aid budget by Dollars 1.4bn to Dollars 12.9bn, imposing a
2 per cent across-the-board cut on all programmes and stiffer reductions in
some areas.
The new aid bill will eliminate the Dollars 70m proposed as the US's
contribution to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Mr
Obey said the EBRD should not expect more money unless it replaced its
directors or underwent 'a radical attitude transplant'. The US contribution
to the International Development Association, the soft loan unit of the
World Bank, has also been slashed.
Bilateral aid to many third world countries will suffer as the
administration remains committed to preserving support to Israel and Egypt,
which already use up about 40 per cent of the total aid budget. Aid to other
countries will be cut further to keep Israel's and Egypt's share unchanged.
