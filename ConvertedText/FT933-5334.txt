FT  03 SEP 93 / International Company News: Rights issue by S African gold
group


   By PHILIP GAWITH


A R250m (Dollars 74.2m) rights offer opens today for Eastvaal Gold, the
company financing the development of the R1.7bn Moab gold mine, one of the
largest high-grade gold deposits remaining in South Africa.
Eastvaal, which until now has been privately held within the Anglo American
group, will also be listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange later this
month.
The Moab project will be the No 11 shaft at the Vaal Reefs complex, one of
South Africa's richest gold mines. Vaal Reefs is managed by the Anglo
American group, the world's largest gold producer.
Production at Moab will start in 1997. In peak production years, it will
produce between 12 and 13 tonnes a year, at an estimated recovery grade of
11.2 grams/tonne.
The issue will cover the after-tax capital expenditure on the project until
early 1995.
