   By ANDREW BAXTER


INGERSOLL-RAND, the US industrial and construction equipment manufacturer,
yesterday reported third-quarter earnings up from Dollars 34.7m, or 33 cents
a share, to Dollars 35.9m, or 35 cents. The per-share figures reflect a
two-for-one stock split in June.
Operating profits, excluding a Dollars 10m charge for the restructuring of
the company's recession-hit aerospace bearings business, slipped by Dollars
5.2m to Dollars 57.5m. Sales rose from Dollars 866m to Dollars 904m.
Net earnings for the first nine months were Dollars 100.8m, or 97 cents a
share, up from Dollars 95.9m, or 92 cents, on marginally higher sales of
Dollars 2.69bn.
Mr Theodore Black, chairman and chief executive, said incoming orders for
the third quarter were Dollars 891m, up 8 per cent from the 1991
third-quarter total of Dollars 829m.
