FT  27 JUN 92 / Letter: Stores tinkle wrong tune


   From Mrs ERNA ANGUS


Yet another store chief complains about customers failing to spend money in
his store ('Music fails to seduce Bentalls' customers', June 23).
But just what are these people doing to 'sell' to us, the public? Tinkling
pianos, gleaming white walls, potted palms. . .it seems they find money for
that, but the one ingredient needed for a successful retailer - ie,
qualified sales staff - is being cut back further and further.
We, the public, can be, and often are, enticed to spend on our clothes, our
homes etc, but it is no longer enough to display the goods. Bring on a real,
trained and motivated salesman/woman, with knowledge of their merchandise
and an interest in selling and watch your takings go up.
