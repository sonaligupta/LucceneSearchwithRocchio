FT  08 NOV 93 / Construction Contracts: A406 work drives on


Extensive foundation work on London's A406 North Circular Road, worth Pounds
9.5m, has been awarded to TAYLOR WOODROW CIVIL ENGINEERING.
The contract was placed by Edmund Nuttall, which is acting as the main
contractor for the Department of Transport scheme.
The project - one of the largest foundation contracts underway in the UK at
present - forms the basis of further improvements to the A406 in the
Finchley area.
Nuttall is to carry out the improvements, which involve increasing the
capacity of the A406 from two to six lanes.
For the new section of road, which will extend 2.3km from east of Falloden
Way up to east of Finchley High Road, Taylor Woodrow will build 2600 bored
piles up to 34m deep, together with more than 700m of 1m-thick diaphragm
wall at depths of up to 24m.
The foundation work has already started on site and is scheduled for
completion in May 1995.
Consulting engineers for the scheme are Gifford Graham and Partners.
