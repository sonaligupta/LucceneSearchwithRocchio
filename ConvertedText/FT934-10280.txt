FT  06 NOV 93 / Brussels to ponder Ilva reform


   By ANDREW HILL


   BRUSSELS


EC commissioners will be asked to back proposals for the restructuring of
Ilva, the loss-making Italian state-owned steelmaker, at their meeting next
week, Andrew Hill reports from Brussels.
Mr Karel Van Miert, EC competition commissioner, is understood to be
pressing for a cut in capacity at Ilva of 2.1m tonnes as a condition for
approving state subsidies of Ecu2.5bn (Pounds 1.9bn). If approved by
commissioners at next Wednesday's meeting, the proposal will go to EC
industry ministers for unanimous approval at their November 18 council.
