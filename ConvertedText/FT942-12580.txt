FT  29 APR 94 / Bank plans to restructure its activities into two wings


   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor


The Bank of England unveiled a plan to restructure its management yesterday
that may result in its wide activities being concentrated into two broad
wings.
In a move designed to make its mission clearer, improve communication and
increase its ability to respond to rapid and potentially dangerous changes
in financial markets, the Bank is proposing to group its activities in a
'monetary stability wing' and a 'financial stability wing'.
The monetary wing would bring the Bank's economic analysis and monetary
operations, such as its activity on the foreign exchange and gilt-edged
markets, under one umbrella. Its supervision of banks and financial markets
in Britain and its monitoring of banking conditions and regulations abroad
would be combined with its efforts to enhance the competitiveness of UK
financial centres in the financial stability wing.
The proposals have been worked out by Mr Rupert Pennant-Rea, the deputy
governor, over the past five months in consultation with staff. The Bank
will forward final details in mid-May with a view to having the wings in
operation by July 1.
If the reorganisation goes ahead, the Bank's international division will
close, and its members will be allocated to the two wings.
