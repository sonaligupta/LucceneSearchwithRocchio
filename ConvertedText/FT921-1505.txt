FT  24 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Community Hospitals at Pounds 2.7m


   By ROLAND RUDD


PROFITS of Community Hospitals, the private medical group, rose from Pounds
1.99m to Pounds 2.68m pre-tax for the six months ended December 31.
And a 'best view' prediction by the directors was for full year pre-tax
profits of Pounds 7m compared to Pounds 5.8m previously.
On the political front, Mr Alan Dexter, chief executive, said he felt
'comfortable' about a Labour victory - although he conceded that Labour was
'ideologically opposed to private health care'.
Operating profit rose 31 per cent to Pounds 2.6m on sales of Pounds 19.3m
(Pounds 16.1m).
Gearing increased from 15 per cent to 22 per cent - representing borrowings
of Pounds 14.7m.
A rights issue in early 1991 raised Pounds 10.4m to help pay for a Pounds
33m building programme.
Mr Dexter did not expect to have to call on shareholders for more money
before 1993 - unless there was a particular acquisition to fund.
The hospitals increased operating profits to Pounds 2.1m (Pounds 1.6m) on
turnover of Pounds 16.5m as the group opened more facilities to cope with
the growing demand for day surgery treatment.
Operating profits from nursing homes rose to Pounds 536,000 (Pounds 358,000)
on turnover of Pounds 2.8m (Pounds 2m).
The group received interest of Pounds 154,000 from the balance of its rights
issue.
Earnings per share rose from 5.5p to 6.2p and the interim dividend is being
raised by 0.2p to 2.4p per share, an increase of 9 per cent - a final of
3.8p was paid for the 1990-91 year.
The directors pointed out that the UK healthcare market had shown continued
resilience to the economic conditions and that both the acute and long-term
care divisions were performing well.
