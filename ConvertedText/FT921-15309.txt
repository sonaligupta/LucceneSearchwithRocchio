FT  10 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: J P Morgan soars 41% to
Dollars 269m

   NEW YORK


J. P. MORGAN, the New-York based banking group, yesterday capped an
excellent 1991 by reporting fourth-quarter profits of Dollars 269m, opening
what is expected to be a strong quarterly earnings season for Wall Street.
The 41 per cent increase in final-quarter income took total earnings for the
full year to Dollars 1.15bn, up from Dollars 1bn in 1990. When extraordinary
gains last year and in 1990 from the early retirement of debt and from
accounting changes are taken into account, however, Morgan's underlying
earnings actually rose 44 per cent in 1991.
A highly favourable interest rate environment, increased trading revenues,
good growth in fee-related businesses and solid corporate finance results
were behind the increase in fourth-quarter profits, the bank said.
The biggest improvement was seen in net interest revenues, which climbed 45
per cent in the quarter to Dollars 419m as Morgan took advantage of lower
short-term US dollar interest rates and the sharp steepening of the US
dollar yield curve.
On the trading front, increased activity in US and foreign debt and equity
markets, and in swaps and commodities, lifted earnings from trading to
Dollars 245m.
Although this was down from an exceptionally strong third quarter, it was
still well above fourth-quarter 1990 earnings and took overall trading
profits for the year to Dollars 1.3bn, up 41 per cent from the previous 12
months.
In other business areas, investment management contributed Dollars 90m and
fees from operational services another Dollars 87m. Although corporate
finance earnings fell 23 per cent to Dollars 74m, Morgan reported a big rise
in revenues from US corporate bond underwritings. Morgan has taken full
advantage of the recent deregulation of US banking laws that has allowed
banks to play a bigger role in the corporate debt underwriting business.
Operating expenses rose 14 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 629m, a
reflection of both higher incentive-based compensation payouts and increased
investment in new technology.
Non-performing loans fell slightly to Dollars 642m because of previous
charge-offs of Latin American and other country loans, while the bank put
aside only Dollars 10m for credit losses in the quarter.
Although yesterday's figures were above market estimates, Morgan's shares
fell Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 67 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange at close
of trading as investors took profits in the wake of the stock's recent
record high of Dollars 70 1/2 .
