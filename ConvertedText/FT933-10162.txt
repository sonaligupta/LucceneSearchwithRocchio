FT  05 AUG 93 / UK Company News: In Shops buys discount chain for Pounds 8m


   By NEIL BUCKLEY


IN SHOPS, the Birm-ingham-based property group, is expanding its retail
business by acquiring the Milbank Foods chain for Pounds 8.15m, but is
seeking a buyer for its Executive Centres serviced offices subsidiary.
The company also announced reduced pre-tax profits of Pounds 2m (Pounds
2.8m) for the year to March 31, on increased turnover of Pounds 26m (Pounds
24.3m). The decline in profits reflected increased losses at Executive
Centres, from Pounds 200,000 to Pounds 650,000.
The final dividend is lifted to 2.09p, making a total of 2.75p (2.63p). Mr
Tim Brookes, chairman, said the increase reflected confidence in the
potential of the enlarged group.
The acquisition is to be financed with a placing and open offer of 14.05m
shares at 58p each.
In Shops operates shopping centres of about 40,000 sq ft, divided into small
units licensed for 12-month periods to retailers. It has forged links with
discounters such as Kwik Save, Netto and Iceland, after discovering that the
presence of such an outlet could attract more customers to its centres.
Milbank has 25 discount stores in north-east England, trading as Job Lot.
They differ from conventional discounters by selling end-of-line and
short-dated goods, often rejected by other grocery chains.
They usually carry fewer than 1,000 product lines exclusively in the areas
of branded frozen foods, dry groceries and toiletries, with no fresh foods.
Mr Brookes said: 'Job Lot doesn't aim to compete directly with supermarkets
 -it doesn't even sell milk, butter or bread - but many shoppers go there
first to see what bargains they can pick up and then complete their shopping
elsewhere.'
Milbank's profits have almost doubled from Pounds 752,000 to Pounds 1.45m in
the past three years, with turnover up from Pounds 15m to Pounds 19.1m.
In Shops hopes that the presence of Job Lot outlets in its centres will
attract more shoppers, thereby stimulating demand for space. Its vacant
space has increased from 14.5 per cent to 17.5 per cent in the last year.
Mr Brookes said the Executive Centres operation had been hit by the
'decimation of the financial services industry' and a general over-supply of
office space which led to a fall in occupancy levels in its centres.
A Pounds 5.5m provision has been made for loss on the disposal, including
Pounds 4m of goodwill previously written off to reserves.
