L57.1bn

MONDADORI, Italy's biggest publishing group which is majority-owned by Mr
Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest company, raised net group profits to L57.1bn
(Dollars 37m) last year from L10.1bn in 1992.
The outcome, marking a further step in the gradual turnaround in Mondadori's
fortunes after the battle for control between Mr Berlusconi and Mr Carlo De
Benedetti in 1990-91, was accompanied by a 13.9 per cent climb in sales to
L1,600bn.
Sales in the first quarter of this year have continued the upward trend,
with a 9.9 per cent increase to L400bn.
Buoyed by the earnings upturn, the dividend is being raised to L200 for
ordinary shares and L220 for savings shares. Last year, the payout was
restricted to holders of savings stock, who received L120 a share.
Fininvest, which is considering a merger between Mondadori and its unquoted
Silvio Berlusconi Editore publishing operation, currently controls almost 80
per cent of the ordinary shares and 90 per cent of the savings stock.
Simint, the listed casual clothing group controlled by financier Mr
Francesco Micheli and designer Mr Giorgio Armani, is making a rights issue
of up to L60bn along with the issue of free new ordinary shares.
The transaction is designed to boost the group's investment in the US, where
it is setting up a new chain of lower-priced clothing stores, called Armani
Exchange (A/X), in conjunction with Mr Armani.
Shareholders will be given five new ordinary shares for every 26 ordinary or
preference shares currently held. Moreover, they will be offered 21 new
ordinary shares for every 26 ordinary or preference shares held, at a price
of between L1,400 and L1,600 a share.
The rights issue will be based on shareholdings prior to the bonus issue.
