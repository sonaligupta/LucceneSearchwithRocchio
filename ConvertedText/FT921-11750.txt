FT  30 JAN 92 / International Company News: Adsteam and bankers agree
refinancing deal


   By BRUCE JACQUES


ADSTEAM, the diversified industrial empire formerly controlled by
Sydney-based corporate raider Mr John Spalvins, has announced long-awaited
agreement with its bankers for a refinancing package, writes Bruce Jacques.
The package, which should stave off formal collapse by the three main group
companies, Adelaide Steamship, David Jones and Tooth and Co, has been under
negotiation since last year.
It involves total debts of about ADollars 3.3bn (USDollars 2bn) and will
effectively delay interest payments until cash is available from operations.
The agreement removes pressure for further asset sales and should ensure
group companies continue trading.
The package may also facilitate the refloat of the jointly controlled
Woolworths operations, one of the country's most successful retailers.
