FT  06 JAN 94 / The Dearing Report: Main recommendations


The Dearing Report ushers in sweeping changes to the national curriculum:
Only English, maths and science, plus 'short courses' in technology and a
modern language, will be compulsory after the age of 14. History and
geography will no longer be mandatory.
14-year-olds will now be allowed to consider vocational courses as part of
the extra choice provided to them. Sir Ron suggests these should fit with
the general national vocational qualifications now being introduced for
16-year-olds to create a '14-to-19 continuum' of courses.
A new curriculum will be introduced for technology from 1996, and the
subject will not be compulsory for 14-year-olds this year or next.
The curriculum for five to 14-year-olds will be 'slimmed down' by dividing
the content of each subject into a central 'core' and more optional
material.
The total proportion of school time to be devoted to the curriculum will be
reduced to 80 per cent - some teachers claim that until now it has required
more than 100 per cent of the time available.
The remaining time each week can be used at schools' discretion, although
teachers' prime concern should be 'to support work in the basics of
literacy, oracy and numeracy'.
English, maths and science - the 'core subjects' will be left intact but the
content of others will be cut, particularly in primary schools.
The number of statements of achievement on which teachers must assess
children will be reduced to avoid the 'excessive detail' of the current
approach, and allow scope to ease teachers' workloads.
The '10-level scale' which measures all pupils on a common basis from the
ages of five to 16 will be abandoned from the age of 14, but retained for
younger ages.
There will be no further changes to the national curriculum orders for at
least five years following the review.
