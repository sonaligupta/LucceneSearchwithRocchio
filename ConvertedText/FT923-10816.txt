FT  28 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Mexico finance groups hit by
rates increase


   By DAMIAN FRASER


   MEXICO CITY


MEXICO'S newly-formed financial groups are estimated to have lost at least
Dollars 500m after a sharp rise in interest rates in May and June.
Long-term real interest rates in Mexico rose about 3 percentage points over
the period. This caused many of Mexico's banks and brokerages to suffer
large losses on the so-called ajustabonos, the long-term bonds which offer a
fixed rate of interest over inflation.
Mr Roberto Barrera of brokers Invermexico put the total loss of financial
groups at Dollars 500m, although other reports estimated losses to be as
high as Dollars 1.3bn. Two stockbrokers said Banamex-Accival, the largest
financial group, lost Dollars 145m while GF Probursa, another broker, lost
Dollars 80m.
Mexican newspapers and some brokers have suggested part of the losses have
been passed on to clients, but the Comision Nacional de Valores said there
was no evidence of this.
The losses are likely to hurt financial groups that depend heavily on
earnings from money market trading, and which had profited handsomely from
steady falls in Mexico's interest rates over past years.
On average, 37 per cent of Mexican stockbrokers' profits came from money
market operations last year. Some financial groups such as GF Probursa and
GF GBM Atlantico depend for more than half their profits on their
stockbrokerage arms.
'This is evidence of the high volatility of earnings on some of Mexico's
financial groups, whose income is overly dependent on brokerage operations,'
said Baring Research in Mexico City.
