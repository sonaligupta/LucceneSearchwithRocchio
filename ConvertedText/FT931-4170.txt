FT  12 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Gephardt warning dims prospects for Nafta


   By NANCY DUNNE


   WASHINGTON


THE prospect of the US Congress approving the North American Free Trade
Agreement dimmed yesterday when Mr Richard Gephardt, the House majority
leader, warned that he would not support the pact 'on a leap of faith.'
In emotional testimony about what he called shocking living and working
conditions he had seen on several trips to Mexican companies, he said Nafta
had to provide for enforcement of labour and environmental laws.
His testimony to the House trade committee followed that of Mr Mickey
Kantor, US Trade Representative, who vowed not to send the agreement to
Congress unless he first negotiated supplemental agreements with Mexico and
Canada to raise environmental and labour standards throughout the continent.
With negotiations on the side agreements due to begin next Wednesday, Mr
Kantor told the House trade subcommittee of his proposal for two trilateral
commissions on labour and environment. These would analyse issues, review
complaints, request information from government agencies and report publicly
on government enforcement.
Mr Kantor also is seeking another approach. Mexico has already agreed to
alter its court system to provide for judicial review of administrative
decisions for the enforcement of intellectual property rights. 'We will
review these provisions to assess their applicability for environmental and
labour issues,' he said.
Mr Kantor was warned by congressmen that the Nafta faces certain defeat
unless the concerns of labour and environment are met and industry comes
forward to lobby strongly for the pact.
