FT  11 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Confused ideas about objectives of
human resource management (1)


   From Mr DUNCAN I BROWN


Sir, Sue Fernie and David Metcalf's criticisms of human resource management
(Recruitment, April 6, UK edition; April 8, international) betray both a
lack of understanding of the concept, and of what personnel specialists are
trying to achieve in applying it. HRM was in large part a reaction against
prior over-specialisation and the lack of business impact of the personnel
function which had helped to create the appalling industrial relations
record and rigid work practices of UK companies in the 1970s.
'Measuring and monitoring the HR function' is the subject of a major
conference for personnel practitioners in June, and it demonstrates that
they are indeed evaluating what their contribution is. And the standard they
are applying is not that of Fernie and Metcalfe - subjective view of good
management/employee relations, for its own sake. It is instead a
demonstrable contribution to improved business performance and the
achievement of the organisation's strategic goals.
The research only reinforces my opinion that the titular allusion to people
with 'lots of pretensions but few practical results' rests more
appropriately with business academics than with those HRM practitioners who
have been making major strides in fighting 'The British disease'.
