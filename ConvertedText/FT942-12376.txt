FT  29 APR 94 / International Company News: First-term earnings up 12% for
Imasco


   By BERNARD SIMON

Higher tobacco and financial services profits propelled Imasco, the
diversified Canadian group controlled by the UK's BAT Industries, to a 12
per cent rise in first-quarter earnings.
Net earnings climbed to CDollars 75m (USDollars 54m), or 60 cents a share,
from CDollars 66m, or 50 cents, a year earlier. Revenues fell by 2 per cent
to CDollars 1.86bn, largely due to the impact of lower interest rates on CT
Financial, holding company for Canada Trust, which is Canada's biggest trust
company.
Although Imasco described prospects for the rest of the year as 'very good',
earnings growth will be dampened by a temporary surtax on tobacco
manufacturers, introduced earlier this year as part of a package to clamp
down on cross-border cigarette smuggling.
The tax, which was imposed in February, reduced Imasco's first-quarter
earnings by CDollars 7m. The company said, however, that the anti-smuggling
measures are generally favourable to its tobacco subsidiary, Imperial
Tobacco.
Imperial posted a 15 per cent rise in operating earnings to CDollars 114m
and CT Financial boosted earnings by 24 per cent to CDollars 73m. But UCS, a
news stand chain, reported a slightly higher loss of CDollars 3m.
