FT  20 APR 94 / International Company News: Italgas earnings rise over year


   By ANDREW HILL

Net consolidated profit at Italgas, the Italian gas and drinking water
distributor, rose by 6.2 per cent to L86bn (Dollars 50.1m) in 1993, compared
with L81bn in 1992.
After a standstill in 1992, gas sales rose to 6.92bn cubic metres last year
from 6.42bn. Profits have yet to return to their 1991 peak of L91bn, but the
company, which held its dividend at L100 per share last year, is
recommending an increased pay-out of L110 per share this year.
In 1994, the company should benefit from the 1.4 per cent increase in gas
tariffs fixed by the government price commission. The decision - which took
effect on January 1 - was the first tariff increase for 18 months. Italgas
turnover rose to L3,897bn last year from a restated L3,614bn.
