FT  27 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Inflation factor in tax argument


   From Mr NICO COLCHESTER


Sir, One crucial point has gone unmentioned as government and opposition
argue about which of them taxes Britain more heavily. It is that inflation
is a hidden tax, which governments are hard-pressed to do without.
Today's Conservative government is trying to sustain a rate of inflation at
least 10 per cent lower than that managed by the Labour government of the
late 1970s. That amount of inflation would eat away the state's net current
debt of roughly Pounds 250bn by Pounds 25bn a year, as part of the insidious
process by which inflation taxes the saver and hands the proceeds to the
debtor.
There is not a huge amount to choose between the indebtedness of the state
today and in the 1970s, but there is a huge difference in its real carrying
cost for the government. Set against a total tax take of some Pounds 220bn a
year, that handicap of Pounds 25bn a year is a big one, particularly now
that income from the sale of state assets has dwindled.
One wonderful thing about low inflation is that it forces governments to be
more honest about what they offer and how they finance it, for any given
degree of involvement in the economy. But it may also force them to put up
with profligate governments of the past claiming that they somehow offered
people more while taxing them less.
They didn't; they just did it more stealthily.
