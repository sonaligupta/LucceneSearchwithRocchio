'satisfactory'

Credit Mutuel, the French banking group, saw net profits rise by 6 per cent
to FFr1.6bn (Dollars 270m) in 1993 from FFr1.5bn in 1992, despite the
pressures on the banking market,
Mr Etienne Pflimlin, chairman, described the group's 1993 performance as
'satisfactory'.
However, he was less optimistic about the outcome for this year due to the
unstable economic situation and changes in interest rates.
French banks last year continued to be affected by the weak credit demand
and high property provisions that have plagued them throughout the early
1990s. Credit Mutuel, according to Mr Pflimlin, reversed the general trend
by faring well in commercial activities but badly in market trading.
It saw net banking income increase by 10.1 per cent to FFr18.4bn in 1993
from FFr16.7bn in 1992, with gross operating profits rising by 23.8 per cent
over the same period to FFr6.5bn from FFr5.2bn.
The group was, however, forced to make provisions of FFr2.08bn, roughly the
same level as in 1992.
