FT  12 NOV 92 / Taiwan acts to help ailing stock market


   By REUTER


   TAIPEI


TAIWAN'S finance ministry announced a long-awaited package of 18 measures to
rescue the country's slumping stock market late on Tuesday, in an attempt to
lure money back to the market and to encourage investment by foreigners,
Reuter reports from Taipei.
The ministry said that it would ask the government's postal savings system
and labour pension funds to buy shares. That would provide up to TDollars
20bn (Dollars 513m) of new money for stock investment, newspapers said.
Restrictions on remittances of funds by foreign investors will be eased, the
ministry said. Foreign fund managers have long complained that curbs on
remittances of capital and profits to their home countries deter investment.
The ministry said it would relax rules to let securities firms provide more
margin loans to investors. Government shares in privatisation exercises
would be auctioned rather than offered at a fixed price. Mr Lai In-jaw,
depity finance minister, said: 'We believe the measures will have a positive
effect on liquidity in the market.'
Disillusioned investors, their confidence shattered by a serious share
scandal and a series of stock payment defaults totalling TDollars 9bn
(Pounds 230m) in September, were in no mood to buy strongly yesterday.
The weighted index closed only 36.36 points or 1 per cent higher at
3,570.89, compared to a 20-month low of 3,351.63which was attained on
September 26.
