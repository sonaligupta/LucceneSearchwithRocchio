FT  05 NOV 93 / Kopper defends banks' success in recession


   By DAVID WALLER


   FRANKFURT


GERMANY'S leading private sector banker yesterday delivered a ringing
defence of the role of banks in the country's economy.
Mr Hilmar Kopper, chief executive of Deutsche Bank, denounced 'the sweeping
disparagements' of newspapers and politicians who have denounced the power
and prosperity of the the big German banks amid the country's worst
recession since the second world war.
Germany's big commercial banks enjoyed a record year last year and the
increase in profits have been sustained this year, despite a worsening of
the domestic credit environment, because of buoyant conditions in world
securities markets.
This has been in marked contrast to the ill fortune of the industrial sector
and has led to criticism that the banks are profiteering at their customers'
expense, for example by not passing on the benefits of falling interest
rates.
Mr Kopper delivered his remarks to an audience of senior businessmen
gathered to celebrate the opening of the Trianon tower, the bank's third
skyscraper in the heart of Germany's financial district. The ceremony was in
itself a celebration of the bank's immunity to the downturn.
Mr Kopper told his guests that the stability of the German banking system
was the envy of the rest of the world. He reminded them that banks which did
not make profits ended up being bailed out by taxpayers, pointing to the US,
where taxpayers have had to find Dollars 180bn to rescue the savings and
loans organisations.
The German universal banking system  - which allows banks to undertake all
manner of financial services business under one roof  - may have its faults,
Mr Kopper conceded, such as lack of transparency. But it was still the best
banking system in the world.
