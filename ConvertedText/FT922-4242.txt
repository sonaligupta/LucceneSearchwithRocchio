FT  06 JUN 92 / Finance and the Family: At a glance - House prices show
slight rise


UK house prices increased last month, according to figures released by the
Halifax and Nationwide building societies. The Halifax index showed a rise
of 0.4 per cent on the previous month, reversing the 0.4 per cent decline
which occurred in April. But Halifax said prices are weak for this time of
year and are 6.2 per cent lower than a year ago.
The Nationwide index showed a marginally higher increase than the Halifax,
of 0.6 per cent in May on the previous month. 'This is the second month in
succession that we have seen a rise in house prices,' said John Hutchinson,
Nationwide's corporate strategy director, 'but it is too early to speculate
that this is a sign of a general, sustainable improvement.'
