FT  27 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: EU farm price plan aims for
stability


   By REUTER


   BRUSSELS


European Farm Commissioner Rene Steichen yesterday presented farm price
proposals for 1994-95 (July/June) aimed at giving farmers and traders
continuity and stability, reports Reuter from Brussels.
The proposals would to a large extent implement cuts in the cereals, dairy
and beef sectors decided under the reform of the common agricultural policy
in May 1992.
Plans to reform the wine, fruit and vegetables and sugar sectors are due to
be presented later this year.
'It would not be in anyone's interest to delay the annual price decisions by
proposing piecemeal changes,' Mr Steichen said.
European Union farm ministers will start to examine the Commission's
proposals at their next meeting on February 21-22.
Mr Steichen told a news conference he had very little budgetary room for
manoeuvre. Farm spending was likely to total Ecu36.678bn (Pounds 29bn) in
1994, overshooting the budget limit by some Ecu200m, he said.
