FT  12 MAR 93 / US moves to extend naval blockade against Serbia


   By GEORGE GRAHAM


   WASHINGTON


THE US yesterday took steps to tighten the naval blockade of Serbia and
Montenegro by adding 25 shipping companies to its list of groups with which
US citizens are barred from doing business.
The US Treasury said the Yugoslav-controlled shipping companies, with a
combined fleet of 55 vessels, had tried to hide their ownership by using
foreign front companies, changing vessel names and reflagging ships.
Mr Richard Newcomb, director of the Treasury's office of foreign asset
control, said: 'Yugoslavia has continued to trade through its maritime fleet
in flagrant violation of United Nations sanctions. Publication of these
names sends a clear signal: the United States will deny the Serbs and
Montenegrins any benefit of regular international commerce.'
The new list of Yugoslav-controlled shipping companies is headed by Milena
Ship Management and Rigel Shipmanagement, two Montenegrin-owned Maltese
companies which between them control 40 bulk and general cargo vessels.
The US can levy fines of up to Dollars 500,000 (Pounds 352,000) on companies
or Dollars 250,000 on individuals for violations of the Yugoslav embargo,
imposed in May 1992. The Treasury has already frozen some Dollars 525m in
Yugoslav assets since the sanctions were imposed, and seven Yugoslav ships
have been held in US ports.
The US is working with Serbia's neighbouring countries to plug the steady
flow of sanctions-breaking goods along the Danube into Serbia.
