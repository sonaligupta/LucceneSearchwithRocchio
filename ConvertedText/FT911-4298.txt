FT  19 APR 91 / International Company News: Georgia-Pacific Dollars 7m in

WEAK demand and pricing pressures have pushed Georgia-Pacific, the largest
US paper manufacturer following its takeover of Great Northern Nekoosa in
March 1990, to a loss in the first quarter of 1991.
The company saw a Dollars 7m deficit, after asset sales in the three months
to the end of March, compared with a Dollars 101m surplus in the same period
a year earlier. If the gain on the sale of its container-board and packaging
assets was excluded, the loss widened to Dollars 50m.
'Business conditions in the first quarter became even more difficult as
demand and price pressures affected both our core businesses,' said Mr
Marshall Hahn, Georgia-Pacific's chairman.
He said pulp and paper mills were 'running well' but domestic businesses
were still hit by demand and price pressures, with little sign of
improvement.
Overall, operating profits from pulp and paper fell from Dollars 182m in the
first quarter of 1990 to Dollars 146m.
