FT  02 JUL 92 / People: Product user turns consultant


When David Evans (right) used to work his way around the world's central
banks in the early 1980s demonstrating Devon Systems International software
packages for managing financial risk, the product was little known, and
because of his name, it was commonly assumed to be his brainchild.
Now, Devon has 200 employees and the financial backing of its parent SunGard
of the US.
And Evans, who in those days was just demonstrating how the product helped
his then employer Samuel Montagu fulfil its reporting requirements, has
decided to join the UK subsidiary as a senior consultant.
The specialist in securities, derivative instruments and forex software
packages has been on the acquisition trail in recent months and Evans' task
is to provide advice on the right way to integrate and internationalise the
new purchases. His perspective will very much be that of a systems user. 'I
can't write a line of code,' he points out.
Evans, 44, for many years in charge of the operations side of the capital
markets business at Samuel Montagu and then Midland Montagu, was around in
the 'frontier' days of futures and options in London - in 1982 he recalls
spending a week trading on the floor of Liffe as soon as the exchange opened
just so that he understood exactly what was involved.
Those were early days for Devon, too, and Evans remembers weekends
'brainstorming' with chairman Cristobal Conde, helping with the 'real dirty'
systems development work.
The two have remained in touch since then and Evans notes how 'with the
market becoming much more staid recently, I am delighted to be doing what I
should have done many years ago'.
