FT  13 APR 94 / Management: Moving jobs in the EU


   By DAVID GOODHART


Your partner has just got a job in Hamburg and you are wondering whether you
can find work there too. You are fed up working as an architect in Rotherham
and someone suggests to you that you should practise your trade for a couple
of years in Barcelona. What do you do?
The European Commission, with its grandiose plans for monetary and political
union, has often been accused of failing the European citizen at more basic
things such as enabling freer movement of labour. From this month things
might improve.
The free movement unit, inside the Commission, has just established a
database on job vacancies in all 12 member states combined with information
about living and working conditions.
Something called Eures (the European employment services) has existed for
some years exchanging information on job vacancies between national
employment services in rather a haphazard way.
Now the service will be much more comprehensive and will be supported by a
group of 250 Euro-advisers. It will also now be possible to go on a list of
job-seekers if you are looking for work in a specific region.
Despite the gradual removal of obstacles to mobility within the EU  - most
recently the principle of mutual recognition of qualifications has been
accepted  - it is still easier in theory than in practice.
The number of EU citizens working in another EU country is only 2.5m  - 1.5
per cent of the working population  - and has been falling in recent years
as poorer countries have become richer and attracted back their former
immigrant workers.
Eures is hoping that more professional people will start to use the new
expanded service. Hitherto the greatest demand in Europe for British
employees has been for skilled manual workers, mainly in construction.
