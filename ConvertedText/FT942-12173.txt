FT  30 APR 94 / Briefcase, Q&A: Tax relief for couples


Your writer Andrew Radice says (Weekend FT, March 12-13) tax relief on the
married couple's allowance is not worth transferring from husband to wife
unless his income is below the threshold. What is this threshold: tax band
25 or 40 per cent? With regard to CGT, he says assets should be transferred
to take advantage of the Pounds 5,800 allowance of the spouse. I thought the
Pounds 5,800 allowance was for husband and wife.
When he wrote 'unless the husband's income is below the threshold,' Radice
meant simply 'unless the husband's income is so small that his income tax
bill would be less than Pounds 344 (viz, 20 per cent of Pounds 1,720) if he
had no married couple's allowance.'
As for your second question, husbands and wives have had separate CGT
exemptions since the introduction of independent taxation. In 1990-91, the
figure was Pounds 5,000 each. It rose to Pounds 5,500 in 1991-92 and to
Pounds 5,800 in 1992-93 and thereafter.
