FT  20 APR 94 / World Trade News: Rolls-Royce names distributor for China


   By Our Beijing Staff


Rolls-Royce Motor Cars this week stepped up its assault on China's growing
luxury car market with the appointment of Inchcape, the UK marketing and
services group, as its exclusive distributor in China.
At a lavish signing ceremony held on the Great Wall, 70km north of Beijing,
Inchcape announced it would establish a series of regional dealerships in
southern China, before expanding to Shanghai and Beijing. A new company,
named Rolls-Royce Motor Cars of China, will be formed to help build sales,
service and parts facilities - complete with training centres to train its
service staff.
More than 50 Rolls-Royce cars have been sold in the Chinese market since
1992, including 30 units in 1993 and 11 in the first quarter of this year.
Customers consist of private entrepreneurs, large joint venture companies
and five-star hotels.
