FT  01 JUL 92 / International Company News: Albania to form joint venture
with Islamic bank


   By MARK NICHOLSON, Middle East Correspondent


ALBANIA has signed an agreement with Arab Islamic Bank (AIB), a
Bahrain-based offshore banking unit, to establish a joint venture Islamic
bank in the country with an authorised capital of Dollars 100m.
Mr Ilir Burhan Hoti, Albania's central bank governor, signed the deal in
Jeddah on Monday to establish the bank in which AIB will hold a 40 per cent
stake and take the management contract, with Albania holding the remainder.
The bank will be the first of its type in the predominantly Moslem state.
AIB said yesterday it expected the bank to be operating by next year and saw
it as a first step, to be followed by setting up a commercial bank in the
country.
The bank, which will open with a paid-up capital of Dollars 20m, will be
called the Arab Albanian Islamic Investment Bank and will offer
Islamic-style investment finance. i
