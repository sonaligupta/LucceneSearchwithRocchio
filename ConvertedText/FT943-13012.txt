FT  21 JUL 94 / People: Virgin directors take flight


Three Virgin Atlantic Airways directors are leaving the group as a result of
a reorganisation of senior management. A six-person supervisory board has
been created, reporting to executive chairman Richard Branson.
The streamlined structure, which was devised after consultation with 40
middle managers, is intended to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of
the airline's senior management, and give the 10-year-old company a better
structure to compete into the next century.
It replaces a system comprising two joint managing directors, reporting to
Branson, and ten other directors. As a result, Syd Pennington, one of the
joint mds, has left the airline but is in discussions on a possible role
within Virgin Group.
The other joint md, Roy Gardner, is to become chief executive of a new
company, Virgin Atlantic Engineering, which will meet the airline's
engineering needs but also seek external customers.
Sales director Rohan Alce, engineering director Dick Plowes and personnel
director Nick Potts have also left or are leaving because their
responsibilities will be handled by the new, slimmed-down board, all of
whose members are internally recruited.
'With this new supervisory board, we will be giving our directors and their
staff greater responsibility for the areas they manage and putting in place
the right teams for the right jobs,' Branson said.
