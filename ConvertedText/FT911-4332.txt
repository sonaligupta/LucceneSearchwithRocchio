THE Court of Appeal will conduct a full appeal hearing into the case of
members of the Maguire family who were jailed in 1976 for running an IRA
bomb factory.
At a preliminary hearing yesterday the court announced it would not limit
argument to the discredited scientific evidence against them. The full
hearing is scheduled for May 7 and is expected to last three weeks.
