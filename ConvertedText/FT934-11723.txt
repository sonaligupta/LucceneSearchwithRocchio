FT  29 OCT 93 / International Company News: Drop in demand hits NSK


   By WILLIAM DAWKINS


   TOKYO


NSK, Japan's leading producer of ball bearings, yesterday reported a sharp
decline in taxable profits for the six months to September, and reduced its
earnings forecast for the year.
It attributed the setback to a fall in demand from carmaking customers.
However, NSK avoided falling into loss thanks to the sale of securities, a
technique used by several industrial companies to tide them through the
recession.
Taxable profits fell by 47.5 per cent from the first half of the previous
year, to Y1.47bn on sales down by 7.9 per cent to Y162.73bn over the same
period.
Operating profits fell even more sharply, by 84.3 per cent to Y722m (Dollars
6.6m), reflecting high fixed costs and the fact that NSK's plants were only
able to operate at between 80 and 85 per cent of capacity.
NSK's security sales brought in a Y2bn capital gain, on top of which it
earned another Y2bn in dividends from affiliate companies.
Operating profits will recover in the second half, thanks to cost-cutting
efforts, but taxable profits for the year will be only Y3.5bn, down from
Y4.16bn in the previous year and well below the group's Y4.1bn forecast.
