FT  26 MAY 93 / People: Padovan takes chair at Gardner Merchant


John Padovan is kicking off the Season in suitable fashion, by accepting the
non-executive chairmanship of the larg-est contract caterer in the UK and
Europe, Gardner Merchant.
Gardner Merchant, which was the subject of a Pounds 402m management buy-out
in January, caters for a multiplicity of functions, ranging from Ascot and
Royal garden parties to the Derby.
It also serves 74 of the FT-SE 100 companies. Padovan, 55, was off to the
Chelsea Flower Show this week in the course of his first official function
for Gardner Merchant.
But it is for his City know-how, rather than social graces, that the former
deputy chairman of Barclays de Zoete Wedd has been hired. The company has
set its sights on a stock market listing, possibly towards the end of 1994.
'We have sold more contracts in the first two months of this year than
during the whole of last year,' says Garry Hawkes, chief executive. He was
referring to the days when the company found itself diverting resources to
negotiations with Compass catering group, which in the end failed to buy
Gardner Merchant.
Gardner Merchant has made particular progress in the public sector.
It recently won contracts for the World Bank in Wash-ington DC, London
Under-ground, and the Hong Kong airport construction site.
Padovan's other activities include the chairmanship of AAH Holdings, as well
as non-executive directorships at Tesco, Whitbread and Hartstone and at a
few private companies. He is also an adviser to BZW, where he was deputy
chairman between 1989 and 1991.
He says he will be 'rationalising one or two' of his portfolio of
directorships and advisory posts.
