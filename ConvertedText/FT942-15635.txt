FT  14 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: John Smith likely to be offered more
sympathetic view


   From GILES RADICE MP


Sir, In your leader ('Mr Major's anniversary', April 9) on John Major's
record since the election two years ago, you tacked on a dismissive last
paragraph about the Labour party, ending with the eccentric judgment that
John Smith's last two years as leader had been 'a nullity'.
Of course, Labour's massive lead in the opinion polls is partly a reflection
of the government's deep unpopularity. But for some time, the trend of
underlying attitudes, always a more accurate guide to public opinion, has
also been running in the party's favour. Voters now trust Labour far more,
believing it to be both united and sensible. They also think that it would
handle the economy better than the Tories. Equally important, they perceive
John Smith as caring, competent and, above all, prime ministerial.
As to policies, it is ludicrous to expect the Labour party to produce
detailed policy statements two years before the next election is due.
However, on the direction of the economy, on tax and spending, on law and
order and on democratic reform, it is developing a fresh approach, while
Labour's European policy is very different from that of the Tories.
Of course, it would be wrong for Labour to be complacent when there is still
such a long time before the next election. But the Smith leadership has made
a promising start which will be fully tested in the coming local and
European elections. I predict that the voters will take a much more
sympathetic view of the Labour party than your leader writer.
