FT  05 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Boots at bottom of expectations - High
hopes for new heart drug but costs will depress profits in short term


   By MAGGIE URRY


SHARES IN Boots, the pharmaceutical and retail group, dropped 23p to 467p
yesterday as the group reported annual profits at the bottom end of
expectations and told analysts the cost of bringing Manoplax, its new heart
drug, to the market.
Pre-tax profits for the year to March 31, excluding profits on property
sales, rose 7 per cent to Pounds 359.5m. Property sale profits added another
Pounds 14.7m (Pounds 13.4m). Group sales were 2.5 per cent higher at Pounds
3.66bn.
Sir Christopher Benson, chairman, said the group was 'extremely pleased'
with the results. He said that econo-mic recovery was slow but there were
'some encouraging sales increases' which gave him some optimism for the
year.
Sir James Blyth, chief executive, said that bringing Manoplax to the market
would depress profits in the pharmaceutical division in the short term,
although in the longer term the group had high hopes for the drug.
The company aims to spend an extra Pounds 15m-Pounds 20m in the current year
on recruiting and training the sales force and will increase its R&D
spending on the drug too.
The pharmaceutical division increased profits by 5 per cent to Pounds 120.8m
on turnover 11 per cent higher at Pounds 699.2m.
Much of the business is overseas, however, and before exchange rate effects
profits were more than 13 per cent higher.
On the retail side, the Boots the Chemist chain increased trading profits by
7.6 per cent to Pounds 246.2m on sales 4.7 per cent higher at Pounds 2.47bn.
This took the chain's net margins to 10 per cent, nearly double the level of
five years ago. Return on capital employed in the chain is 57.1 per cent.
Boots' other retail formats, such as Halfords, Do It All and Childrens
World, turned in a combined trading loss of Pounds 5.3m compared to a profit
of Pounds 27.3m. Many of these businesses were acquired when Boots took over
Ward White in 1989 for Pounds 900m.
Sir James said that these businesses were affected by the economic
recession. Halfords, the car parts and bicycle retailer, lost Pounds 10.5m
(profit Pounds 2.8m).
Sir James said its car servicing business lost more than that while the
shops were profitable. The other main loss maker was Childrens World, losing
Pounds 6.7m (loss Pounds 4.7m), which Sir James said had yet to reach
critical mass.
The property division increased trading profits from Pounds 60.1m to Pounds
69.5m, including the profits on property sales.
Interest charges fell from Pounds 65.1m to Pounds 43.1m and central costs
were down from Pounds 18.1m to Pounds 13.9m. Net borrowings were cut by
Pounds 109.7m, of which Pounds 41.7m represented convertible bonds switched
into shares, to Pounds 362.3m. This left gearing at the year end of 25.3 per
cent (37.3 per cent).
Earnings per share rose to 26.4p (24.2p). An increase of 8 per cent to 8.1p
in the final dividend 1p is proposed to give a total of 12.4p (11.6p).
