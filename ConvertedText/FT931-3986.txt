FT  12 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average records
fifth straight gain

   TOKYO


TRADING slowed ahead of the settlement of stock index futures and options
today, but the Nikkei average posted its fifth consecutive gain on buying by
foreign investors and public funds, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average closed up 46.16 at 17,904.79 after a day's low of
17,735.43 and a high of 18,104.65. Rumours of political unrest in Russia
briefly depressed prices in the afternoon, but late position adjusting by
arbitrageurs supported the index.
Volume fell to 450m shares from 541m, while gainers led losers by 532 to
471, with 153 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks
rose 2.46 to 1,344.34 and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 3.24 to
1,085.16.
Investors were encouraged by the market's longest consecutive gain since
last November. While some corporate investors were seen liquidating tokkin,
or specified money trusts, buying by public funds added support.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone rose Y5,000 to Y795,000. Analysts said that
the share price had advanced due to a low liquidity position in the stock,
and was now being traded like a speculative issue by dealers. Some 60 per
cent of the 5.4m shares are held by individual investors, who do not trade
the issue, and 20 per cent by financial institutions, which are stable
shareholders.
However, the increase in tariffs, expected later this year, will allow NTT
to increase capital investments in digitalised systems. 'NTT is one of the
cheapest telecom companies in leading stock markets by valuation,' said Mr
Eric Gan at Kleinwort Benson.
Companies with close links to NTT also gained ground: Iwatsu Electric rose
Y51 to Y477, Daimei Telecom Engineering put on Y23 to Y742 and Nippon Comsys
rose Y30 to Y785.
The recent rally in the formerly state-owned NTT has boosted interest in
Japan Railway related shares, as a rise in the telecom company's shares will
pave the way for the listings of other public corporations. The government
is expected to launch stock sales of JR East and Japan Tobacco during the
next fiscal year to March 1994.
Tekken, a construction company with close ties with the Japan Railway group,
gained Y24 to Y824, while Nippon Signal, the railway signal maker, rose Y10
to Y1,400.
Steel companies fell on profit-taking: NKK, which announced a restructuring
programme on Wednesday, including a 15 per cent cut in workers, fell Y11 to
Y260, while Nippon Steel eased Y1 to Y317.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 68.68 to 18,834.22 in volume of 70.1m shares.
Nintendo, the video game maker, improved Y100 to Y10,100.
Roundup
POLITICS played an important role in affecting Pacific Rim markets.
HONG KONG lost ground as fund raising exercises announced on Wednesday
encouraged profit-taking.
But the market picked up from the day's lows, encouraged by news that Mr
Chris Patten, the governor, had delayed a key address to the colony's
legislature while Britain considered an approach from China on possible
talks.
The Hang Seng index finished 116.62 or 1.8 per cent lower at 6,372.37 after
pulling up from the day's low of 6,300.55.
HSBC Holdings, due to announce results next Monday, topped the active list
and dropped HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 68.50. Cathay Pacific shed 5 cents
to HKDollars 9.80 after it reported higher net income for last year.
AUSTRALIAN shares continued their strong run after higher unemployment
figures were seen to improve the prospects for an opposition win in
tomorrow's federal election. The All Ordinaries index closed 13.7 up at
1,661.1 in turnover of ADollars 373.1m.
The day's star performer was tobacco group WD & HO Wills, which rose 45
cents or 22 per cent to ADollars 2.50 after posting a 250 per cent increase
in net profit on Wednesday. Brambles climbed 12 cents to ADollars 16.16.
TAIWAN rebounded as late bargain hunting improved sentiment after the heavy
profit-taking seen early this week. The weighted index added 144.98 or 3.2
per cent to 4,619.38 in active turnover of TDollars 65.2bn.
