FT  15 APR 94 / Government sets out terms for ERM truce


   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor


The government yesterday set out the terms for a truce between the
Conservative party's pro-Europeans and Euro-sceptics on Britain's attitude
to the European exchange rate mechanism.
In a series of carefully crafted phrases, the party's economic policy
document for the European elections campaign declares that Britain will not
consider re-entry to the ERM in the foreseeable future. The wording was
approved by Mr John Major, the prime minister, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign
secretary and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor.
But the formulation of the document - A Competitive Britain in a Competitive
Europe - left the door open for a change of heart after the next election.
The document says that Britain's criticism of the ERM had been widely
acknowledged. In those circumstances, it says, 'we will not re-enter such a
mechanism in the foreseeable future, nor could we do so until it is clear
that such faults no longer exist'.
That olive branch to the Euro-sceptics is followed by a reassurance to
pro-Europeans that 'we will not, however, cut ourselves off from future
discussion of how economic policies can best be co-ordinated within the
European Union in order to secure competitiveness, growth and jobs'.
Ministers said the wording would provide the basis of the party's position
to be set out in the full manifesto next month.
Ministers also voiced confidence that the formulation would bridge the sharp
divide on Tory back benches over ERM membership.
On the issue of a single currency, the document repeats the studiously
neutral position implied by Britain's opt-out from the Maastricht treaty.
Parliament would retain the right to take a separate decision - in the light
of Britain's interest and needs - if and when other members of the EU moved
to create a single currency.
