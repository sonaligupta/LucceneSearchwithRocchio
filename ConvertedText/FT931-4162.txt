FT  12 MAR 93 / PowerGen agrees 4-5% pay deal


   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor


ONE OF the most generous awards of the current pay round has been granted at
PowerGen, the electricity generator, where the 5,500 workers will receive
annual rises ranging from 4 per cent to 5 per cent, well above the inflation
rate of 1.7 per cent.
This contrasts with far less generous deals at some of the regional
electricity companies in England and Wales. At Eastern Electricity, for
example, pay has been frozen and the working week has been increased from 37
hours to 40 hours.
At Southern Electricity a pay rise of 2.9 per cent plus a Pounds 200 lump
sum was awarded, but in exchange for a radical flexibility deal on working
time including 12-hour working days and regular Saturday work.
At National Power, PowerGen's larger rival, workers received 3.9 per cent
over 15 months from October but also agreed to accept a performance pay
system next year.
The PowerGen deal, the first since the introduction of 'single table'
bargaining with the unions for all the main groups of workers at the
company, provides a 2.5 per cent increase on basic rates with additional
lump sum payments ranging from Pounds 250 to Pounds 550.
Mr Jim Mowatt, chief union negotiator, said the deal would be recommended by
the unions.
It appears that Power-Gen was keen to pay as much as possible in a lump sum
so that next year, when trading conditions are likely to be harder, pay
scales will not have been raised to a much higher level.
The government, which has set a limit on public-sector pay bills of 1.5 per
cent, still owns 40 per cent of PowerGen.
