FT  23 NOV 92 / NHS may seek links to private sector


   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent


PROSPECTS OF opening the National Health Service's internal market to
greater private-sector involvement have been signalled by Mrs Virginia
Bottomley, health secretary.
She told the Healthcare Financial Management Association conference in
London that, after measures announced in the Autumn Statement, she was
interested in examining joint ventures to improve and extend patient
services. 'Joint ventures should mean additional resources for the NHS,' she
said.
Before the general election, the government faced repeated allegations that
its health reforms were a prelude to privatisation, and ministers are
anxious not to revive those. Mrs Bottomley will therefore proceed
cautiously.
NHS health authorities and hospitals are already involved in some joint
ventures with the private sector. The Health Department sees scope for
extending those in areas such as hospital waste disposal and energy
conservation, as well as in clinical services.
In addition to joint ventures, new arrangements for equipment leasing will
enable trust hospitals to acquire expensive items such as scanners without
exceeding their funding limits.
Organisations including Bupa, Britain's biggest private healthcare group,
would be interested in increasing their involvement with the NHS and will
seek meetings with the Health Department.
