FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Murray Johnstone to launch venture trust


   By BETHAN HUTTON


Murray Johnstone has announced plans to launch one of the new breed of
venture capital trusts, details of which were outlined in the last Budget.
Full details will be published in the Finance Bill next month, but the fund
management group is confident that it will be able to work with the
legislation.
Murray Johnstone plans to launch the trust within the first six months of
next year. It will be managed by Mr Iain Tulloch, its Glasgow-based venture
capital fund manager.
The group will be looking to raise between Pounds 15m and Pounds 30m.
Venture capital trusts will be legally restricted to investing mainly in
very small companies with assets of less than Pounds 10m, which increases
management costs.
However, Murray Johnstone aims to mitigate these by co-investing with other
venture capitalists.
Private investors are to be offered substantial tax breaks for investing in
venture capital trusts at launch. These include 20 per cent up-front income
tax relief on investments of up to Pounds 100,000 a year, tax-free income
and capital gains from the trust if the shares are held for at least five
years, and the possibility of deferring capital gains tax liabilities from
other investments if the gains are rolled into the trusts.
