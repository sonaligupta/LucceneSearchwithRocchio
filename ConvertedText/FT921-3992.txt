FT  11 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Receivers in at West End property company


   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent


RANDSWORTH Acquisition, a property company with a Pounds 350m portfolio of
West End offices and shops, has gone into administrative receivership.
Randsworth was bought by JMB Realty Corporation, a Chicago-based fund, for
Pounds 258m at the peak of the property market in July 1989. Its move into
the UK, which reflected the relatively high returns available, was highly
unusual for a US investor.
Mr Tim Hayward and Mr Roger Oldfield of KPMG Peat Marwick who have been
appointed administrative receivers, said they intended to avoid any fire
sales.
'It is our present intention to permit the operating subsidiaries to
continue through their existing management with a view to enhancing their
long term value,' said Mr Hayward.
The main operating sub-sidiary is London and Provincial Shop Centres Group.
Its accounts for the year to June 30 were 'qualified by the auditors as to
whether preparation on a going-concern basis is appropriate because the
company and certain other group companies have failed to make capital and
interest payments to their bankers'.
The appointment of administrative receivers comes at the end of several
months of discussions between the shareholders and its bankers, chiefly
Citibank.
Mr Hayward said the portfolio had been acquired on a highly leveraged basis.
He estimated that the debts were between Pounds 350m and Pounds 400m.
