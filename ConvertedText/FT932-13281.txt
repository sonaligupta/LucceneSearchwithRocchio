FT  23 APR 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (15): Out of the
shower to splash out on Norcros - With a rise of more than 64 per cent after
18 months, the portfolio draws confidence from the success of its
speculation in Burlington / Equities, Building a Portfolio


   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON


I WAS taking a shower when I suddenly thought of a highly speculative
investment. I was delighted with my newly-installed Triton electric shower
which replaced an old gas-heated system.
Triton is owned by Norcros, and in that company's November statement (for
the half-year to September 30, 1992), the chairman, Julian Sheffield, stated
that the company 'continues to reap the rewards' from Triton's 'strong
market position.'
However, he also reported that half-year pre-tax profits had fallen from
Pounds 6.3m to Pounds 5.6m, with earnings per share down from 3p to 2.5p. He
warned: 'It is unlikely that we will see any significant improvement in
trading conditions during the second half-year.'
So why buy the shares? Because Mr Sheffield also said the company 'should
benefit from our continuing cost-reduction and productivity improvement
programme.' I also feel that lower interest rates should reduce the
company's borrowing costs. But the main attraction is Norcros's takeover
potential.
Earlier this month, MB-Caradon sold its 25 per cent stake in the packaging
company, Carnaud Metalbox for Pounds 473m. Analysts immediately started
speculating as to which companies in the building materials sector might be
on the receiving end of the now cash-rich MB-Caradon. Most overlooked
Norcros, which is listed in the Other Industrials sector - yet it has much
in common with MB-Caradon.
For example, Norcros not only owns Triton showers but also Crittall windows.
MB-Caradon owns Mira showers and Everest windows. Norcros owns Crosby Sarek
doors, H&R Johnson tiles - plus tile-adhesive companies and an innovative
print and packaging division.
With a share price of 158p, Norcros has a market capitalisation of Pounds
214.7m. Even if MB-Caradon had to pay 200p-225p to gain control of Norcros,
it could easily afford it and the benefits of cross-promotion of products
worldwide could be tremendous. My personal pension scheme has therefore
taken a modest stake in Norcros.
However, the review's portfolio cannot be too speculative. Norcros is due to
report its full-year figures in early June. What if they are disappointing?
In 1992, the shares were as low as 62p, which shows how far they might fall
 -especially if the company does not attract a predator. The share price
could also be dragged down by a general dip in the market. Thus, I am only
investing Pounds 4,740 of the portfolio's cash to buy 3,000 Norcros shares.
I will also set a stop-loss level of 138p-140p.
One of the reasons I feel the portfolio is ready for Norcros is that its
speculation in Burlington Group has proved so successful. In October, it
bought 8,000 Burlington shares for 11.5p each, in the hope that the company
would attract the attention of an entrepreneur, since, at that level,
Burlington had a market capitalisation of under Pounds 2m; it was thus a
relatively cheap stock market vehicle for anyone wanting to expand their
business interests. I stated that, in the absence of any bid rumours, the
portfolio would sell its shares if they reached 23p-25p.
The shares shot up to 17p after my October article but subsequently fell
back to 13p before powering upwards again. When the shares reached 27p on
March 26, I thought that, surely, a large stakeholder would be revealed. But
nothing was announced, and so the portfolio sold half its shareholding.
Thus, an initial Pounds 920 investment in that company has produced cash of
Pounds 1,080, so the portfolio's remaining 4,000 Burlington shares have
effectively cost it nothing. It can therefore take a more relaxed view
should the shares fall back and no predator appear.
In his February, 1993, statement in Burlington's 1992 annual report, Mr DC
Marshall, chairman, commented that at the year-end Burlington's net asset
value was 18.1p per share.
The portfolio would therefore consider buying up to 20,000 more Burlington
shares if their price fell back again to around 13p-15p (my personal pension
scheme has been buying and selling shares in Burlington since 1989).
The benefit of patience and stop-loss levels can be seen with the
portfolio's experience with Fisons. In the summer issue of the Review, I
felt Fisons shares could eventually recover, and so I bought 1,000 at 168p
in August with a stop-loss level of 130p. In January this year, when Fisons
were over 230p, I stated that the stop-loss limit would be raised to 200p as
I still took a cautious view of the company and its takeover prospects. In
March, Fisons fell to that 200p level and the portfolio disposed of its
entire holding at a profit.
The portfolio retains its investment in Pentland, and has benefited from
that company's surprise payment earlier this month of a 12p-per-share
dividend in order to distribute to shareholders the majority of the Pounds
47.3m exceptional profit which the company made from currency gains
associated with its aborted bid for Adidas. I regard Pentland as a good
long-term investment, and have high hopes for its Speedo swimwear and Pony
sports shoes brand. Pony could eventually be as well known as Reebok.
If the shares fell back to their 1992 low of 94p, the portfolio would
consider buying another 2,000. (My personal pension scheme has a holding in
Pentland.)
In the last Review, I mentioned a number of companies which I was monitoring
with a possible view to a purchase for the portfolio. I liked Allied
Colloids but was hoping the shares would fall to 200p-210p in order to make
a purchase. Like Meggitt (target price 75p-80p), Renishaw (240p-250p), EIS
(355p) and William Ransom (40p-45p), Allied Colloids did not fall within the
portfolio's buying range.
Having reconsidered all these companies' prospects, I have revised the
levels at which the portfolio will make a purchase. The portfolio will
therefore buy 1,000 Allied Colloid shares if a general market drop causes
them to fall to around 215p.
The revised purchase level for 2,000 shares in Meggitt, a well-run
engineering group, will be 80p-85p. Another international engineering
company, EIS Group, will be bought (750 shares) if they fall back to 400p -
but a stop-loss level of 350p would also be set. Renishaw would be purchased
(1,000 shares) if they fell to 250p-260p, with a stop-loss level of 200p.
In the last Review, I stated that the portfolio would consider buying 5,000
shares in William Ransom (in which my pension scheme has a small holding) if
the shares fell to around 40p-45p. They, too, did not fall, but I feel the
company has good prospects, so the portfolio will buy 3,000 shares at 52p
each and will consider buying a further 2,000 if the share price falls back
to the 40p-45p level, although a stop-loss limit of 35p would be set.
One of the reasons I like William Ransom is that it is involved in the
extraction of plant material for the health care, food, beverage and
cosmetic industries. I feel this is an area of activity that could be due
for a boom. Last year, I read a news report which stated that scientists at
universities at Vienna and Innsbruck had demonstrated that lavender oil can
help combat stress. I feel that some enterprising pharmaceutical company
ought to be developing all sorts of treatments involving lavender oil -
already used by some aromatherapists to treat drug addicts.
I hope that William Ransom could then supply the necessary ingredients.
Meanwhile, as a well-managed, profitable company with a wide spread of plant
extract expertise - and with a market capitalisation of only Pounds 8.1m -
it has considerable appeal. If the shares fall, I will have to sniff some
lavender to calm down]
The author of this feature, which first appeared in the autumn 1991 issue of
the Review, is familiar to many readers as the writer of the Diary of a
Private Investor column in the Weekend FT. The Review invited him to suggest
a Pounds 10,000 portfolio for capital growth, without being too speculative.
The opinions expressed are his own.
