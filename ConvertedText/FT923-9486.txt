FT  05 AUG 92 / Observer: Foxed


The arrival of Robin Woodhead as the new boss of commodity futures market
London FOX removes one possible contender for the really big exchange
management job still going - that of chief executive of Liffe when Michael
Jenkins retires.
Liffe had hoped to name its candidate by now - but apparently the favourite,
who comes from outside the derivatives industry, has suddenly become
indispensable to his present employer.
At least this shows that Liffe is definitely seeking fresh blood, rather
than settling for an insider - of whom there are two reasonably competent
candidates. Another name mentioned - regulator Phillip Thorpe, who has been
the caretaker at FOX - seems never to have been seriously in the running.
It sounds as if Liffe has gone back to the drawing board, and Jenkins, who
has promised he will continue until the right person is found, is in there
for a while yet.
