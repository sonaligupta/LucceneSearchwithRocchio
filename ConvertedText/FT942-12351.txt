FT  29 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading


   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE


Disappointing US economic data put a stop to a gently rising futures market
yesterday, although turnover improved on this week's low levels, writes
Christopher Price.
The June contract on the FT-SE opened firmly, hitting 3,168 at the outset
and immediately finding enough buyers to nudge it forward during the morning
session. But there was little for the market to focus on in terms of
economic or financial statistics and the Bundesbank's decision not to move
rates typified the featureless early trading.
It all changed in the early afternoon with the release of disappointing GDP
and inflation figures from the US, and June immediately retraced its steps,
a move reinforced when Wall Street opened sharply lower.
June closed at 3,121, its low of the day, but with turnover a more
respectable 12,289 contracts - compared with 6,900 on Wednesday. Dealers
said Wall Street's attempt at a recovery in after hours trading had lifted
June to 3,125.
Turnover in traded options was also higher, with 42,721 contracts dealt
against 37,037 the previous session. Among the stock options, bid target
Lasmo once again figured strongly at 2,083 contracts, although food retailer
Sainsbury led the way at 2,303.
