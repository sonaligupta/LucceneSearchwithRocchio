FT  19 APR 91 / International Company News: Pfizer advances to Dollars 267m

   NEW YORK


PFIZER, the US pharma-ceuticals company, yesterday reported a 17 per cent
improvement in first-quarter net income on a 20 per cent rise in sales,
after stripping out discontinued operations from the 1990 results.
Including extraordinary items, Pfizer's net income in the first three months
of 1991 rose 6 per cent to Dollars 267.4m, or 79 cents a share, from Dollars
251.9m, or 75 cents, a year earlier. Earnings per share have been restated
to reflect a two-for-one stock split in January.
In the 1990 quarter, the sale of the DeKalb Pfizer Genetics seed business
contributed Dollars 39m in pre-tax income. Sales in the quarter rose 14 per
cent to Dollars 1.7bn from Dollars 1.48bn, led by growth on the health care
side.
Schering-Plough, The New Jersey-based pharmaceuticals and health care
products group, lifted first-quarter earnings to Dollars 173.2m, or 79 cents
a share, from Dollars 150.4m, 66 cents a share, a year earlier, writes
Bernard Simon in New York.
Sales rose to Dollars 949.3m from Dollars 865.1m, despite the sale last July
of the Maybelline cosmetics business.
