International Business Machines yesterday surprised Wall Street with higher
than expected second quarter earnings as expenses were sharply reduced.
It said demand for mainframe computers was strong, but it still faced
serious problem in its personal computer operations. A raised target for
cost reductions could result in further job losses.
Second quarter earnings of Dollars 689m (Pounds 440m), or Dollars 1.14 per
share, were well above analysts estimates' of 45-80 cents per share. For the
same period last year, IBM reported a loss of Dollars 40m, or 8 cents per
share, before restructuring charges that brought net losses to Dollars 8bn
or Dollars 14.10 per share.
Mr Lou Gerstner, chairman and chief executive, said: 'We are still far from
where we need to be, but we are showing steady improvement'. IBM's share
price gained Dollars 5 1/8 to Dollars 61 by midday in New York.
Revenues for the quarter were Dollars 15.4bn, an increase of 3 per cent.
Computer hardware sales rose 3 per cent, but software revenue was flat. The
US and Europe were static at Dollars 5.9bn and Dollars 5.5bn respectively,
while sales in the Asia Pacific region picked up 14 per cent to Dollars
2.8bn.
Total expenses declined by 18 per cent and 8,000 jobs were eliminated.
Research and development spending was reduced by almost 21 per cent to
Dollars 1.1bn.
Last year, IBM said it intended to cut expenses by Dollars 7bn from 1992
levels, by 1996. To date they are down Dollars 4.8bn. Mr Jerry York, chief
financial officer, said IBM had increased the goal for cuts to Dollars 8bn.
It still plans to reduce its workforce by a further 20,000 this year to
215,000 and more job cuts now appear likely in 1995.
In IBM's traditional mainframe computer business, demand exceeded supply.
'We are sold out on mainframes well into the fourth quarter,' said Mr York.
Revenues continued to decline as a result of price cuts, but the rate of
decline had slowed.
IBM's Dollars 13bn PC business, however, is facing serious problems.
Revenues declined in the US, Mr York said, although there was 'decent growth
in overseas markets' and overall revenue growth was about 5 per cent.
Mr York said IBM would consolidate its PC operations, simplify product
design and product lines and take steps to resolve inventory and logistics
problems.
In the computer services sector, targeted for growth, revenues increased 24
per cent.
For the half year, IBM reported net earnings of Dollars 1bn, or Dollars 1.68
a share. This compares with a net loss of Dollars 372m, or 66 cents, in the
first half of last year, excluding restructuring charges. Revenue for the
six months was Dollars 28.7bn, up 4 per cent. Lex, Page 16
