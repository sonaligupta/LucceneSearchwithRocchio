FT  28 JUL 92 / Money Markets: Bearish mood stays


SENTIMENT in both the ster-ling cash and futures markets remained bearish
yesterday as the Bank of England forecast a large shortage in the morning
and the economic picture in Britain continued to be grey.
The pound's slightly more encouraging performance on the foreign exchanges
in the morning, up to a high of DM2.8539, softened period rates. However,
the currency's performance tailed off in the afternoon, sterling falling
back to a finish of DM2.8430, and rates remained at roughly the same levels
that they had been at on Friday night.
Dealers continued to be bearish about the prospects for the UK economy,
heavily influenced by press reports that today's quarterly industrial trends
survey from the Confederation of British Industry will show a sharp drop in
business confidence. This, and fears of a Lombard rate rise in Germany, make
a base rate cut unlikely in the immediate future.
One-month money was slightly softer at 10 1/16 per cent, against 10 3/16 per
cent on Friday night, and three-month money was at 10 1/4 per cent, down
from 10 5/16 per cent. Six-month money continued to underline the market's
bearishness, offered at 10 5/16 per cent.
Dealers said the softer rates reflected the Bank of England's accommodating
position in the discount market, where an early round of offers was invited,
and the Bank regularly made repurchase agreements (repos) repayable on
August 13 and 14 at 9 15/16 per cent.
In the morning, the Bank purchased Pounds 12m in the repo, Pounds 23m of
Band 1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent, and Pounds 200m again in the repo.
In the afternoon, the Bank bought Pounds 267m of Band 1 bank bills, Pounds
68m of Band 2 bank bills and Pounds 54m in the repo. The Bank provided late
assistance of Pounds 515m.
Futures trading was quietly bearish. The September short sterling contract
closed at 89.70, five basis points down from its previous close.
In Germany, the Bundesbank, keeping a tight rein on German money market
rates, again injected emergency funds into the banking system to prevent
call money rising above its key 9.75 per cent Lombard rate. The Bundesbank
added funds at 9.70 per cent after call money had risen to 9.70-9.75 per
cent.
