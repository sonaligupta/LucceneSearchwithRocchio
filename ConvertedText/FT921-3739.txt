260m on R&D


   By ALAN FRIEDMAN and NIKKI TAIT


   NEW YORK


GENENTECH, the California-based biotechnology company that is controlled by
Switzerland's Hoffman-La Roche, is planning to spend Dollars 260m, or more
than 50 per cent of its expected 1992 revenues, on research and development,
writes Alan Friedman in New York.
The company said yesterday its 1992 earnings would be between 10 and 12
cents a share, which contrasts with 1991 full-year earnings of 39 cents a
share, or Dollars 44.3m. Genentech's 1992 revenues would be unchanged on
last year's Dollars 515.9m.

American Express, the financial service group, said it agreed yesterday to
renew for another 10 years a marketing and promotional alliance with Walt
Disney, the entertainment company. The American Express charge card and
travellers cheque would be the 'official' card and cheque of Disneyland in
California, Walt Disney World in Florida and the new Euro-Disney resort in
France.

Pilkington's US subsidiary yesterday said it received authorisation from the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to market a new coloured contact lens
called 'Natural Touch'.
*****
Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP), the largest French commercial banking
group, yesterday announced a joint venture with Neuberger & Berman, a New
York investment manager, to form a cross-border investment services company.
General Mills, the US food and restaurant group, yesterday reported a small
drop in third-quarter profits, from Dollars 134.1m to Dollars 132.1m after
tax, writes Nikki Tait in New York.
This takes the total for the first nine months to February 23, to Dollars
402.5m, compared with Dollars 381.8m a year earlier.
However, General Mills said the comparisons were muddied by unusual charges
and earlier asset sale gains.
The group said the restaurant side saw operating profits improve by 24 per
cent in the third quarter ahead of one-off charges, while the consumer food
division advanced by 9 per cent.
General Mills shares fell Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 66 1/2 .
