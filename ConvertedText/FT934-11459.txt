FT  01 NOV 93 / Airlines may fly Dollars 2.5bn into the red


   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent


AIRLINES ARE expected to lose a further Dollars 2.4bn-Dollars 2.5bn on
international scheduled services this year, after losing Dollars 11.5bn in
the three previous years, the International Air Transport Association warns
in its annual report today.
In spite of some tentative signs of improvement in recent months, the 221
members of Iata, the airline trade organisation, do not expect a rapid
turnaround in profitability. At best, the industry is expected to break even
next year, with the possibility of a reasonable profit in 1995 or 1996.
'Even then, we are not talking of healthy industry-wide profits of the order
of 5-6 per cent of turnover: the airline industry has never achieved this,'
said one London airline industry analyst.
The main cause for the heavy losses has continued to be overcapacity,
provoking fare wars undermining yields, says Mr Pierre Jeanniot, Iata's
director general.
But he notes some improvements this year, with airlines restructuring their
operations and with capacity coming more into line with passenger demand.
Iata also expects the trend towards more consolidation through mergers,
partnerships and commercial alliances to accelerate.
After increasing by 10.2 per cent last year compared with 1991, Iata expects
international passenger traffic to grow by an average of 6.6 per cent a year
between now and 1997.
Last year's increase reflects recovery from the dismal performance in 1991,
when passenger numbers declined for the first time as a result of recession
and the Gulf conflict.
The latest five-year passenger growth forecast is between one and two points
lower than forecasts made before the 1991 air transport crisis.
Traffic to and from western Europe - the largest international market - is
expected to grow by 5.9 per cent a year.
