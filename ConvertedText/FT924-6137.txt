FT  23 NOV 92 / International Company News: Norway set to reveal rescue
terms for banks

NORWAY is today expected to announce details of a recapitalisation package
for the country's three biggest banks.
It emerged at the weekend that the ordinary share capital of Den norske Bank
(DnB), Norway's biggest bank, has been wiped out and will have to be written
down to zero, according to Mr Tormod Hermansen, the head of the state-backed
bank insurance fund.
The fund and top executives of the three banks remained locked in
negotiations late last night over further state cash to prop up the banks.
Last year the state injected more than NKr20bn (Dollars 3.1bn) into the
banking system, which had come close to collapse.
Mr Jarl Veggan, a DnB executive, refused yesterday to comment on the fund's
statement that the bank's ordinary share capital had been wiped out. DnB's
A-shares have recently been trading at NKr0.90 on the Olso bourse.
Mr Veggan said negotiations with the fund were likely to continue through
the night and that a meeting of DnB's board could then be convened to settle
how much cash the bank would be forced to seek from the state.
Mr Hermansen said the banks would be given sufficient state capital for
their capital adequacy to exceed the 8 per cent BIS minimum required by the
end of the year. The banks are believed to be seeking enough cash to shore
up their capital adequacy to at least 10 per cent of risk-weighted assets.
Mr Hermansen said further state capital transfers, which would have to be
approved by parliament, would be subject to stringent terms and conditions.
He called on the banks to cut costs drastically and take steps to boost
profitability.
However, the banks' fourth-quarter earnings are likely to suffer from the
turmoil in the foreign currency markets which forced Sweden last week to
float its currency and put heavy pressure on the Norwegian krone.
