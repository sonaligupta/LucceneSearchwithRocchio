FT  20 MAY 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report


   By REUTERS


Growing sentiment that producers are close to a unified stance on price
supports helped to lift COFFEE prices in London and New York. The July New
York arabica contract moved above key resistance at 65.20 cents a lb in
early trading. Traders were hesitant to sell despite conflicting reports on
whether questions had been reached regarding agreement on shares in any new
quota plan, a target price or selectivity, analysts said. In Chicago MAIZE
and SOYABEANS were sharply lower at midday in reaction to bearish export,
planting, and weather reports. 'You are starting to blow people out of
here,' one broker said of the domino affect of fund selling in the maize
market. The pressure spilled over into WHEAT. PLATINUM rose as the London
bullion market digested Monday's bullish Johnson and Matthey report. New
York platinum futures pared early gains by midday. A 17 per cent fall in US
housing starts in April, the biggest drop in eight years, undermined
sentiment by pointing to a still-anaemic economy, analysts said. The New
York COTTON market was limit down at midday following overnight rain in the
Delta region of the US.
