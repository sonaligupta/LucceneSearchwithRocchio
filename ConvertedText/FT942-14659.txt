FT  19 APR 94 / International Company News: McGraw-Hill fall reflects former
venture


   By REUTER


   NEW YORK


McGraw-Hill, the US publisher, said a 1.9 per cent fall in first-quarter net
income to Dollars 14.97m from Dollars 15.2m in the same period last year
reflected the seasonal impact of owning 100 per cent of a former
joint-venture school publishing company, Reuter reports from New York.
Earnings per share were 30 cents, compared with 31 cents a year earlier.
The company reported a strong performance in financial services, continued
improvement in some advertising-based businesses and better than anticipated
results in school publishing. Revenue for the quarter rose 19.9 per cent to
Dollars 559.8m.
A strong performance by its broadcasting group and upswing in advertising at
Business Week and other publications helped revenue rise 2.6 per cent in its
information and media services segment.
