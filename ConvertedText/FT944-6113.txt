FT  30 NOV 94 / International Company News: Coles Myer to continue property
review


   By EMILIA TAGAZA


   MELBOURNE


Disgruntled shareholders at Coles Myer's annual meeting yesterday were told
by the Australian retailer's chairman that the company would continue to
review its property holdings to improve earnings.
Mr Solomon Lew told the Melbourne meeting that the yield on commercial
property was only about 7 per cent, excluding capital gains, and that it did
not add to earnings because it went directly to reserves. By comparison, the
return on retail investments was about 18 per cent.
The statement followed Monday's announcement that the group had sold
ADollars 500m (USDollars 382m) worth of retail property. Mr Lew confirmed
that the proceeds would fund the ADollars 1.26bn buy-back of the more than
21 per cent of Coles' issued capital owned by Kmart of the US. 'Since these
proceeds were not expected, or indeed needed, to fund our ambitious capital
expenditure programme, the company will have the option to use these funds
to reduce debt incurred in the Kmart buy-back - should it be deemed
desirable to do so,' he said.
Mr Lew faced questions about earnings and dividend performance. The
questions included the company's performance compared with Woolworth;
executive salaries; possible conflicts of interest arising from
director-supplied goods; and the Kmart buy-back. Organised shareholders,
represented by the Australian Shareholders' Association, queried the level
of goods supplied to Coles by companies controlled by Mr Lew and another
director, Mr Lindsay Fox.
The association's Mr Julian Stock said that goods bought from Mr Lew's
companies rose 44 per cent over the last three years while the value of
transport services provided by Mr Fox's companies have increased by 64 per
cent.
