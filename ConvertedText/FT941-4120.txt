FT  12 MAR 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): US funds fuel gold price
rally


   By RICHARD MOONEY


The gold price recovered from an early set back this week to end near the
top of its recent trading range.
After a neutral start the market was undermined on Tuesday by news that
Japan was planning to sell about 90 tonnes of melted-down surplus gold
coins. A three months low of Dollars 375.35 a troy ounce was quickly reached
and, after a tentative rally, was undercut by another 5 cents the following
morning.
But that proved to be the trigger for a salvo of trade buying and
short-covering that lifted the price to Dollars 379.55 by Wednesday's close
and to Dollars 385 a day later. A five-week high of Dollars 387.10 an ounce
was set at yesterday morning's London bullion market price fixing, but by
the close profit-taking had trimmed that to Dollars 387, up Dollars 10.50 on
the week.
The price surge had been fuelled, traders said, by options-realted buying in
New York and by funds seeking a haven as the Whitewater rumours rocked US
bond, equity and currency markets. Another bullish influence was growing
concern about the political situation in South Africa in the run-up to next
month's elections.
That last factor was still more potent for the platinum market, especially
with regard to the homeland of Bophuthatswana, which accounts for 30 per
cent of South African mine production of the metal, equating to about 20 per
cent of world output.
The London platinum price was fixed at a seven-month high of Dollars 405.50
an ounce yesterday morning, but was pared back in the afternoon to Dollars
403.75, up Dollars 12,25 on the week.
Silver also joined in the fun, aided by increasing interest from US
investment funds. The London cash price ended the week 19 1/2 cents higher
at Dollars 4.03 3/4 an ounce.
London Metal Exchange copper traders, having twice failed to breach Dollars
1,920 a tonne for the three months delivery position and subsequently tested
the solidity of support below Dollars 1,900, finally succeeded yesterday in
their efforts to gain a foothold in higher ground. The price closed at
Dollars 1,929 a tonne, up Dollars 22.50 on the day and Dollars 15 on the
week.
Dealers told the Reuter news agency that the late surge, which was
encouraged by a big fall in exchange warehouse stocks and a slight narrowing
in the cash discount, or 'contango', could have set the market up for a push
towards Dollars 1,950 a tonne.
Aluminium was also firmer yesterday, though the three months delivery
position's Dollars 14 rise to Dollars 1,299.50 a tonne still left it Dollars
3 down on the week. The market was aided by confirmation of an 8,000-tonnes
a year output cut at Norway's Soer-Norge smelter, although earlier in the
week it had taken little cheer from news of a planned 20,000 tonnes a year
cut by Aluminium Bahrain, the Gulf's largest producer and the first to back
multilateral efforts to balance the market.
The London Commodity Exchange robusta coffee market was trying to
consolidate yesterday after a a sustained rise had run into upside
resistance. The May futures position touched a three-month peak of Dollars
1,285 on Thursday and again yesterday before closing at Dollars 1,275 a
tonne, up Dollars 26 on the week.
'The market is still looking in good shape if we can consolidate around
here,' one trader commented.
The initial uptrend had led some traders to suggest that a rise to Dollars
1,300 was possible, but others had foreseen that there would be strong
resistance in the Dollars 1,280-Dollars 1,288 range.
