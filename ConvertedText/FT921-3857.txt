FT  12 MAR 92 / International Company News: Israeli bank profits gain almost
50% to Shk63.5m

FIRST International Bank of Israel (Fibi), controlled by Brazilian brothers
Mr Joseph and Mr Maurice Safra, announced a net 1991 profit of Shk63.5m
(Dollars 27.6m), a near 50 per cent improvement over 1990 when the bank's
record as Israel's most profitable bank slumped under the weight of domestic
recession and reverses in its UK operations.
In 1991, net return on capital at Fibi, Israel's fifth largest bank, bounced
back to 8.4 per cent from just over 6 per cent the previous year when it
lost its position as best performer to Bank Hapoalim, the country's biggest
bank.
The bank's bigger rivals have yet to report, but Fibi is likely to be back
on top for 1991 as the Bank of Israel has warned that profits at the 'big
four' will be all but wiped out by a new law enforcing big write-offs of
agricultural debts.
Fibi raised its provisions by more than 23 per cent to Shk92m, but said the
new law had little effect on its results because bad farm debts had been
fully provided for previously.
Fibi, the only one of the five top banks not majority owned by the
government, said it had achieved last year's improvement by expanding
banking activities in the business and financial sectors and through greater
involvement in the capital markets.
Net operating income was up more than 24 per cent at Shk182.4m.
Total assets were up 7.2 per cent at Shk10.5 bn.
The bank announced a cash dividend - the first for three years - totalling
Shk13.7m, or three times nominal share capital.
