FT  27 MAR 92 / Crash probe finds 'no abnormality'


NO 'airworthiness abnormality' affected the Super Puma helicopter which
crashed in the North Sea earlier this month with the loss of 11 lives, the
Air Accidents Investigation Branch said yesterday after examining the
helicopter's flight data recorder.
The accident happened on March 14 while 15 oil workers were being ferried
200 metres from an oil platform to their accommodation vessel in stormy
weather with waves up to 36 ft high.
