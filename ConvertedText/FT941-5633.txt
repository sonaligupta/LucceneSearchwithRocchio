FT  05 MAR 94 / Judge warns on Lloyd's claims


   By JOHN MASON


Lloyd's Names suing the London insurance market for alleged negligence over
recent losses might not be fully compensated even if they win their cases,
the Commercial Court judge in overall charge of the litigation warned
yesterday, John Mason writes.
Mr Justice Cresswell said: 'It is necessary to impress on the parties to the
Lloyd's litigation that there is a distinct possibility, even if the claims
are sound in law, that there may be insufficient money to satisfy them all.'
The total for all claims against Lloyd's exceeds Pounds 3.5bn. Lloyd's
estimates that following the decision by Names - the individuals whose
assets support the insurance market - to reject its Pounds 900m compensation
settlement offer, the maximum amount of cover available to meet court awards
is about Pounds 1.1bn.
Mr Justice Cresswell, who has just completed a review of the progress of the
litigation, said the Commercial Court would continue to meet the
'considerable challenge' of the Lloyd's litigation.
However an appropriate balance had to be kept between the demands of those
actions and other cases brought before the court.
