FT  27 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: Pemex raises Dollars 366m in
asset securitisation debut

   MEXICO CITY


PETROLEOS Mexicanos, Mexico's state oil company, has raised Dollars 366m in
an asset securitisation deal. The privately-placed debt, which has a
maturity of 7 1/2 years, is backed by revenues from future oil exports and
marks the first time Pemex has used such revenues to guarantee its debt.
The securitised debt has a single-A rating from Standard & Poor's, the US
rating agency. This is the first time S&P has given an investment grade
rating to long-term uncollateralised Mexican debt. Pemex will pay 165 basis
points over US Treasury bills for the debt, which was placed with US
institutions earlier this week. The deal was lead-managed by Citibank.
The negotiations over the securitised debt took nearly two years to
complete. Within Mexico, the question of whether Pemex should back debt with
future oil revenues is a sensitive one. Mexico's oil industry was
nationalised in 1938, and the regulatory law that governs Pemex prohibits it
from selling rights to oil reserves. The securitisation does not explicitly
commit Pemex to produce or export oil, and is therefore legal.
Pemex is expected to take advantage of more securitisation of debt now that
the first issue has been successfully placed. It is also working on the
securitisation of US Eximbank export credits for a Dollars 250m debt issue
to develop the Sonda de Campeche oil field, according to a report in El
Financiero newspaper.
