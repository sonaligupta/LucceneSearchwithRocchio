FT  12 MAR 93 / Observer: Up and . . .out


One thing the ambitious German executive never forgets: you are not a
Vorstand (main board director) until you are a Vorstand.
Agreed, nothing is assured even for the brightest and best. But is the lofty
Deutsche Bank not perhaps getting a touch careless with its aspiring talent?
It recently lost Gianemilio Osculati, 45, who quit as head of Banca
d'America e d'Italia, Deutsche's Italian subsidiary, after five years in
which the bank's profits had more than doubled. A head office job was
supposedly on offer, but not a Vorstand position, and he returned to his old
stable, McKinsey.
Now Frank Heintzeler, at 53 the executive vice-president in charge of
corporate finance activities, is also off. With his background - son of a
former chief legal officer of the BASF chemicals company - and his ability,
he seemed patently board material. But in 1990, the obvious route to the top
was blocked with the arrival of new Vorstand member Ronaldo Schmitz,
formerly finance director of BASF, put in charge of corporate finance.
Heintzeler leaves - on 'friendly terms' of course - to join the board of the
Baden-Wurttembergische Bank, a thriving Stuttgart institution. Next year he
becomes chief executive - but where is that in the pecking order compared
with a Vorstand seat at Deutsche?
