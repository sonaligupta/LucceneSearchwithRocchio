FT  06 JUN 92 / European arms cuts pact signed

NATO and its former Warsaw Pact adversaries yesterday signed an agreement on
sweeping arms cuts in Europe, which had been blocked by the collapse of the
Soviet Union and disagreements among its successor states over how to share
out reductions in tanks, aircraft and other military equipment.
The protocol to the conventional forces in Europe treaty (CFE), signed in
Paris at the end of 1990 when the Soviet Union was still a unified state,
was signed by 29 members of the North Atlantic Co-operation Council, created
in December as a forum for co-operation between Nato and the former Warsaw
Pact members.
The problems between Russia and the other members of the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS) were finally sorted out at a summit in Tashkent
last month. The aim is that the CFE treaty will now be ratified by all its
signatories in time for a summit of the 52-nation Conference on Security and
Co-operation in Europe, due to be held in Helsinki at the beginning of next
month.
However, one of the CIS states, Belarus, may not be able to ratify the
treaty in time because it is still drawing up a constitution and because of
domestic political opposition, according to officials here.
Most Nato and east European countries have already ratified the treaty, but
Turkey has yet to do so. Once the treaty has been ratified by all its
signatories, the arms cuts will have to be implemented over a four-year
period.
Under the CFE treaty, the former Soviet republics have undertaken to destroy
much more equipment than western countries, whose conventional forces in
Europe have always been numerically smaller. But the treaty does not cover
cuts in military manpower. That issue will be the subject of a new
agreement, negotiations for which have barely got under way. Nuclear weapons
and naval forces are also excluded from CFE.
Among the CIS states, by far the biggest cuts will be made by Russia,
followed by the Ukraine and Belarus.
