FT  12 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): US markets fall on weak jobs
claims data

Wall Street
AFTER three days of record-setting gains, US share prices fell yesterday in
the wake of disappointingly weak jobs figures, writes Patrick Harverson in
New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 21.34 at 3,457.00.
The more broadly based Standard & Poor's 500 ended 2.32 lower at 454.01,
while the Amex composite finished 0.43 firmer at 422.31, and the Nasdaq
composite up 1.41 at 694.28. Trading volume was 252m shares.
The tone of the day was set from the start by the weekly jobs claims data
which showed that during the final week of last month the number of people
claiming state unemployment insurance jumped by 25,000, a much bigger
increase than analysts had expected.
Not only did the figures suggest that the labour market remains depressed in
spite of the recent improvements in economic growth, but they also cast
doubt over last week's unexpectedly strong February employment figures in
which non-farm payrolls soared by 350,000 over the month.
In light of the data, analysts predicted a significant downward revision in
the February employment numbers when the March report is released early next
month. On an brighter note, the Commerce department announced that retail
sales rose 0.3 per cent in February, or 0.9 per cent excluding motor vehicle
sales. Economists had predicted a small decline in total sales.
Among individual stocks, some of the biggest cyclicals, which led the recent
record-breaking rally, ran into profit-taking and renewed nervousness about
the outlook for economic growth. International Paper fell Dollars 1 3/4 to
Dollars 64 5/8 , Alcoa tumbled Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 70 7/8 , and General
Motors slumped Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 38 1/2 . Some computer stocks,
meanwhile, were in mixed form. Compaq, which earlier this week slashed
prices on a range of its best products, rose more than Dollars 1 early on
before slipping back to end up Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 50 5/8 and Motorola
gained Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 64, but IBM dropped Dollars 1 to Dollars 54
7/8 and Hewlett-Packard eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 78.
National Semiconductor jumped Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 12 7/8 in volume of
2.5m shares after the company reported fiscal third quarter net income of 19
cents a share, up from 11 cents a share a year earlier.
Glaxo fell Dollars 1 to Dollars 18 7/8 in volume of 4.8m shares on the news
that Mr Ernest Mario, the UK drug group's chief executive, had resigned. On
the Nasdaq market, Sun Microsystems was the big story of the day, plunging
Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 32 1/4 in volume of 6m shares after two analysts,
at Goldman Sachs and Dean Witter, said they were worried about the company's
order levels in the current quarter.
Canada
TORONTO stock prices closed flat in heavy trading. According to preliminary
data, the TSE-300 index closed up 0.43 points, or 0.01 per cent, at
3,552.42. Advancing issues outnumbered declines 359 to 283. Volume was
65.787m shares, up from Wednesday's 54.449m, and trading value rose to
CDollars 573m from CDollars 535.1m.
