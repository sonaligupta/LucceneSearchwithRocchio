FT  29 APR 94 / UK Company News: Vosper Thornycroft Pounds 8.6m acquisition


Vosper Thornycroft Holdings, the Southampton-based shipbuilding and
engineering group, has acquired HSDE (Holdings) for an initial Pounds 8.6m.
A performance-related deferred consideration of up to Pounds 500,000 may
also be paid.
HSDE designs, makes and services electronic systems for controlling and
monitoring equipment in a wide range of industry sectors. It made pre-tax
profits of Pounds 1.5m on turnover of Pounds 16.9m in 1993.
The acquisition begins Vosper's establishment of an enterprises group to
develop businesses in markets independent of its warship contracts.
