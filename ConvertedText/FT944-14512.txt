FT  22 OCT 94 / UK Company News: F&C share issue to raise Pounds 115m


   By BETHAN HUTTON


Foreign & Colonial Emerging Markets Investment Trust is set to raise up to
Pounds 115m of new capital with a C share issue.
Institutional investors have already spoken for 85m C shares at 100p during
the placing stage, and a further 30m shares are available in a public offer
opening on October 24. Demand has already exceeded F&C's expectations; the
group had expected to cap the issue at Pounds 70m.
The trust currently has assets of about Pounds 150m. The additional capital
will make it the second largest general emerging markets trust, after
Templeton Emerging Markets, which has assets of Pounds 509m.
According to figures from Smith New Court, the F&C trust was last week
trading at a package premium - taking both shares and warrants into account
 -to net asset value of 8.9 per cent, meaning that even after costs, the new
issue should be a cheaper way to buy into the fund than acquiring shares in
the market.
The trust's current asset allocation gives the heaviest weighting to Latin
America (43 per cent) and Asia (37 per cent), with smaller amounts in
Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Figures from the Association of
Investment Trust Companies place its share price performance second in its
sector over three years to end September.
Dealing in the C shares is due to start on November 18, and their conversion
into new ordinary shares and warrants will take place by March 31 1995.
