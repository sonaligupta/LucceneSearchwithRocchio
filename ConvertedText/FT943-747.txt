   NEW DELHI


KLM Royal Dutch Airlines yesterday said it had applied for approval to start
flights to Madras and hoped to launch services from next spring as part of
its attempt to open up a southern India gateway and expand services to
existing destinations. At present KLM flies four times a week to Delhi,
three times to Bombay and once to Calcutta. KLM needs extra capacity as load
factors have been at 95 per cent for nine months of the year on Indian
routes. In the cargo market, KLM is seeking to build up freighter flights
from Dubai to Delhi, Bombay, Bangalore and Madras.
