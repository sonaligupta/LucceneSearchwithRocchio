FT  17 JAN 92 / International Company News: General Motors to pull out of
car production in Korea


   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent


GENERAL Motors of the US, the world's biggest vehicle-maker, is planning to
withdraw from car production in South Korea with the sale of its 50 per cent
stake in the troubled Daewoo Motor.
GM said yesterday it was 'exploring the possibility' of selling its stake to
the Daewoo Group, holder of the remaining equity in Daewoo Motor.
The disposal is a severe setback to GM's plans for expansion in the
Asia-Pacific region.
South Korea is expected to be one of the world's fastest-growing car markets
in the 1990s, but GM has decided to pull out of car-making in the country in
the face of its prolonged conflict with the Daewoo Group over the management
of Daewoo Motor.
GM said it would maintain its presence in Korea through a number of
automotive components joint ventures, which would also continue to supply
Daewoo Motor.
The disposal of the 50 per cent stake in Daewoo Motor was subject to the
negotiation of an 'acceptable' price and other terms, it said.
Earlier this week, GM announced that it had agreed to enter its first
vehicle production venture in China, where is it planning to assemble light
commercial vehicles.
