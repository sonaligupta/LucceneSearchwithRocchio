FT  27 MAY 93 / Pounds 290m gas link to Belgium could be completed by 1997


   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES


CONSTRUCTION of a Pounds 290m gas pipeline linking the UK to Belgium could
start at the end of next year and be completed by 1997, according to
companies which launched the project yesterday.
The steering committee of seven companies studying the feasibility of the
link plans are planning to distribute a prospectus next week. The companies
are trying to gauge market interest in the project in the hope of raising
construction funds.
The 215km pipe would carry 15bn cu m of gas a year to Zeebrugge in Belgium.
It could then be distributed on the European gas grid.
Companies involved in the project, including British Gas, British Petroleum
and Norway's Statoil, are believed to be planning a pool system for using
spare capacity.
Energy companies are expected to be asked to agree 20-year contracts for
sending gas through the pipe. If at any time they do not want to fulfil all
their commitment, they can make spare capacity available in the pipe through
the pool system.
This would be run by a company which is expected to be set up to operate the
pipeline.
Arthur D. Little, the management consultancy group, is co-ordinating
responses to the prospectus and is expected to decide whether to go ahead
with further engineering studies by the third quarter of the year. By that
time companies will have to commit about Pounds 1.5m for the design work.
European gas demand is expected to increase rapidly in the next 20 years.
Some estimates suggest it could rise by as much as 55 per cent from 300bn cu
m per year to 450bn cu m a year.
UK gas would have to compete in that market with gas from Russia, Algeria
and possibly Iran.
But the pipeline could also be used for importing gas into the UK from
Europe.
