FT  05 JUN 92 / The Property Market: Croydon shows the way


If one comment about Canary Wharf particularly wounded Olympia & York, it
was likening the Docklands to Croydon. The irony is that the comparison is,
if anything, unfair to Croydon.
Croydon is the sixth largest office centre in the UK. Although it has the
same amount of office space as the Docklands - 10m sq ft - the vacancy rate
in Croydon is just 8 per cent, compared with about 50 per cent in the
Docklands. The Dockland's transport system is still embryonic, while Croydon
has 20 railway stations and two motorways on its doorstep.
In stark contrast with the Docklands, the growth of Croydon in the 1960s was
a triumph for its developers and Croydon Corporation, which fostered it.
But not everything is going Croydon's way. Office rents have fallen by up to
30 per cent in the past 18 months; and office vacancies are likely to
increase as leases expire and company relocations slow down.
Perhaps the most damaging aspect of Croydon is the appearance of its serried
ranks of tired 1960s office blocks. But if Croydon's 1960s architecture is
now heartily despised, what chance do the bland facades of the Docklands
have of standing the test of time?
