FT  13 NOV 92 / Letter: Property right for pensions


   From Mr PATRICK J BUSHNELL


Sir, Lex ('Dividend deficit', November 9) may have missed a point when it
suggested that in a weak dividend environment mature pension funds might
switch from equities to bonds. In recent years property has been either
overlooked or treated with suspicion by the pension fund industry.
Current property yields are at an all-time high, at 9.9 per cent as measured
by Investment Property Databank. Property now offers higher income returns
than long-dated gilts (8.7 per cent), UK base rates (8 per cent) and very
substantially higher-than-average dividend yield (4.6 per cent).
There are, of course, the justifiable arguments of oversupply in some
instances and that much of the property market is overrented - that is, let
on rents that are higher than current rental value - and that values are
still falling. This may well be true in some parts of the market, most
notably London offices. However, there are significant proportions of the
property market away from London where property is not substantially overlet
and still offers strong income returns.
In due course there will be prospects for rental and capital growth
re-emerging as the economy recovers to add to the attractions of this
market.
