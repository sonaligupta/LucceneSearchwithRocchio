FT  11 NOV 92 / International Company News: Chevron to cut head office costs
by Dollars 200m

   NEW YORK


CHEVRON, the fourth biggest US oil and gas group, unveiled plans to cut
annual corporate headquarters operating costs by Dollars 200m, or 30 per
cent, as a result of reductions in staff.
The San Francisco-based company said the decision - part of a broader
programme to reduce total group expenses - was taken following a six-month
long study.
The changes will result in a reduction of about 1,000 positions, or 28 per
cent, from the level of headquarters staff at the beginning of this year.
Since about 550 corporate staff employees have already opted for early
retirement, the net number of jobs being cut will be about 450. The job cuts
will occur in more than a dozen departments, including tax, treasury, legal
and human resources.
The oil and gas group also announced a separate measure to reduce costs by
restructuring its in-house technology company.
This move is expected to save Dollars 35m to Dollars 45m a year and will
result in the reduction of another 500 jobs, or 22 per cent of the total.
Mr Kenneth Derr, Chevron's chairman, said that he regretted 'that these
changes will leave some employees without jobs'.
He said the cuts reflected the business environment.
Chevron's third-quarter net earnings, announced last month, were 21 per cent
higher at Dollars 378m.
