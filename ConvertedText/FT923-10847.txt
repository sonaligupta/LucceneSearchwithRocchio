FT  28 JUL 92 / Banks report increase in their mortgage lending


   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff


BANK LENDING for house purchases increased modestly in the second quarter,
but the rise did not represent a real improvement in the housing market, the
British Bankers' Association said yesterday.
The latest quarterly figures from the association, the trade body for
Britain's nine biggest banking groups, showed that mortgage lending in the
second quarter totalled Pounds 4.2bn compared with Pounds 3.6bn in the first
quarter and Pounds 4.1bn in the second quarter of last year.
Lord Inchyra, the association's secretary-general, said: 'Considering the
situation in the domestic property market, this must be regarded as quite a
satisfactory outturn.' However the increase was unlikely to represent any
real improvement in the housing market. 'When figures are available for all
lenders, I suspect they will show that the banks have taken a larger share
of a smaller market,' he said.
Lending by banks for house purchases represent about a third of total
mortgage lending. Mr John Ecklin, head of the association's statistical
unit, said the banks may have increased their market share by offering more
attractive schemes. 'The banks are offering a lot of fixed-rate schemes at
the moment which are very popular with the public,' he said.
Some of the improvement could also be put down to seasonal factors,
reductions in mortgage rates and the temporary lifting of stamp duty.
There were 81,900 approvals for mortgages in the second quarter, a 23 per
cent increase on the first quarter. This restored the figure to the same
level as in the second quarter of last year. For the first time since the
series began in 1986, just over half of the approvals were for first-time
buyers.
The average value of new loans approved rose from Pounds 44,700 to Pounds
45,600, although this was still 4 per cent below the average value a year
ago.
