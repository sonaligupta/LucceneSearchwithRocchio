FT  30 APR 94 / Proposed tobacco advert ban attacked


   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent


Newspaper and magazine publishers lined up yesterday to oppose a private
members' bill that would outlaw tobacco advertising, warning that such a ban
would 'amount to censorship and set a dangerous precedent'.
The bill, proposed by Mr Kevin Barron, Labour MP for Rother Valley, is due
to reach its report stage on May 13. The government, which opposes the bill,
was surprised by the scale of support for the measure at second reading when
MPs voted by 227 to 17 in favour of it.
In an attempt to pre-empt the bill, it is still possible the government will
announce before May 13 that it has reached agreement with tobacco
manufacturers on stricter voluntary controls on advertising.
MPs are being urged by newspaper and magazine publishers to 'reaffirm their
support for the freedom of the press, the freedom of speech and the freedom
of consumer choice by rejecting any attempts to outlaw advertising of
products legally and freely available in the UK'.
A statement circulated to MPs yesterday was signed by industry groups
including the Newspaper Publishers Association, representing national
newspapers; the Newspaper Society, which represents the regional and local
press; and the Periodical Publishers Association, representing magazines.
The Advertising Association, the umbrella group which has been co-ordinating
opposition to the bill, calculates that the publishing industry stands to
lose about Pounds 50m a year in advertising revenue if a ban goes ahead.
