FT  25 MAR 92 / Observer: It all adds up


Interviewing three applicants for his chief accountant's job, a
small-business owner gave them a test by handing each the latest year's
trading details, and asking what profit he'd made.
The first candidate fairly swiftly named a figure. 'Thanks,' said the
company chief, 'I'll let you know soon'.
The second said he'd prefer to take the accounts home and analyse them
overnight. The chief agreed, adding: 'Call me tomorrow.'
The third didn't even look at the accounts, but simply asked: 'What profit
do you want to make?'
'Can you start Monday?' the chief said.
