FT  11 APR 94 / International Company News: First-quarter loss for Alcoa due
to charge

Alcoa, the world's largest aluminium producer, reported improved operating
results for the first quarter, but a Dollars 117.9m extraordinary charge
left the company with an overall loss.
The group, battling against the debilitating effects of sagging world
aluminium prices, has been cutting costs and trimming production. Its first
quarter operating improvement was attributed to cost-cutting and slightly
higher aluminium prices.
It said operating earnings, excluding charges, rose to Dollars 9.6m, or 10
cents per share, in the quarter, a turnround from a fourth-quarter loss of
Dollars 16.7m but well below first quarter 1993 earnings of Dollars 27.6m,
or 31 cents per share. First-quarter revenue rose to Dollars 2.2bn, from
Dollars 2.1bn in the same period last year.
Including the extraordinary items, Alcoa suffered a loss of Dollars 108.3m,
or Dollars 1.22 a share, in the first quarter. The previously announced
special charges included Dollars 50m for closing a California forging plant
and Dollars 67.9m for early redemption of high-interest debt.
The company took Dollars 70.2m in restructuring charges in the fourth
quarter of 1993, and in February announced it would cut US aluminium output
by 100,000 per year in an effort by producers to boost prices.
