FT  08 NOV 94 / Observer: Bread and circuses


Proof positive that there is such a thing as a free lunch. That's what
voters got on Sunday when they turned out for a presidential election and
constitutional referendum in Tajikistan, the central Asian country at war
since its inception in 1991.
Tajikistan has 2.64m registered voters, who had to choose between Tajik
president Emomali Rakhmonov and challenger Abdulmalik Abdulladjanov. About
20,000 people have already died in the civil war. Now there's a food
shortage as well as a guerrilla war.
Free rice pilaff was served as an enticement for people to vote.
Abdulladjanov - currently Tajikistan's ambassador to Russia - must have
hoped that as a former minister of bread, he was in with a chance.
Instead, the voters appear to have endorsed the pilaff prince; Rakhmonov was
declared the winner with 80 per cent of the vote.
