FT  29 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Hanson news hits ICI


   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO, COLIN MILLHAM, CHRIS PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON


TRADING in ICI became frenetic at mid-morning as the stock market reacted to
the statement by Lord Hanson that his conglomerate had no intention of
bidding for the chemicals group.
The price of ICI shares moved so sharply that the quotation screen moved
into backwardation, the situation when one marketmaker quotes a higher bid
price than another's selling quote. Sellers were seen at 1245p but the
mid-price recovered later from a low of 1253p to end at 1267p, only 2 off on
the day.
Lord Hanson bought his 2.82 per cent stake in ICI last May, paying 1194 1/2
p a share for 20m shares. Assuming carrying costs of around Pounds 21m he
would have to sell the shares at around Pounds 13 apiece to show a profit.
The original stake purchase was carried out by securities house Smith New
Court, and as Smith's chemicals analyst Mr Charles Lambert pointed out: 'He
needs his dividend to break even at these levels.' The final dividend is
expected to be about 34p and is due towards the end of April.
Observers were surprised that Hanson lost 5 1/2 to 208p in spite of a
positive annual meeting. But the stock has had a good run recently and US
investors were taking profits.
BET worries
International business services group BET fell steeply after one securities
house turned seller and another was said to have sharply cut its forecasts.
UBS Phillips & Drew was yesterday reminding clients that its prediction for
the year ending March 1993 was down to Pounds 140m and advising them to sell
the shares. Mr Mark Shepperd of UBS added: 'I no longer believe that the
dividend is absolutely safe.'
The shares were further affected by strong speculation that Cazenove, BET's
joint broker with BZW, had lowered its forecasts for the second time.
Cazenove never comments on its moves but it is believed to be forecasting
Pounds 110m for the year ending in March and Pounds 140m for the year to
March 1993.
The shares stood at 205p before a hefty forecast cut less than two weeks ago
by Robert Fleming Securities. That cut prompted most houses, including
Cazenove, to follow suit. The stock lost 17 yesterday to 159p with 16m
shares traded, the heaviest turnover for a year.
GRE rises sharply
Long-running rumours that a bid for Guardian Royal Exchange, the composite
insurance group, might be about to emerge from either the UK or Europe drove
GRE shares sharply higher.
They closed a net 7 firmer at 135p on exceptionally heavy turnover of 8.2m.
Dealers have noted strong support for GRE shares in recent weeks,
accompanied by heavier than usual activity in the stock.
The latest stories of an imminent takeover move against GRE suggested Sun
Alliance, GRE's fellow UK composite insurer, as the favourite to launch a
bid, with Axa Midi and the UAP/Sun Life grouping, both French-domiciled,
said to be other keen contenders.
GRE is scheduled to report preliminary figures on March 19 and the group is
one of the market's blue chip favourites for a cut in its dividend payment.
Analysts expect GRE to produce pre-tax losses of more than Pounds 200m for
1991, against a deficit of Pounds 157m in 1990, with many insurance
specialists forecasting a halved final dividend.
Sun Alliance, where 1991 losses are expected to reach Pounds 400m, has a
14.8 per cent stake in Commercial Union, another UK composite, whose shares
eased 2 to 463p. Sun shares dipped 3 to 296p.
Housebuilder and construction group Taylor Woodrow came under a sustained
bout of selling pressure from the outset as at least three leading brokers
chopped forecasts for the company to allow for expected provisions against
financial strains in the housing and Eurotunnel operations.
BZW lowered its forecast for the current year from Pounds 40m to Pounds 12m
and for 1992 from around Pounds 50m to Pounds 25m. Hoare Govett, Taylor
Woodrow's broker, shifted its current-year number from Pounds 20m down to
zero and for 1992 from Pounds 40m to Pounds 20m.
Charterhouse Tilney was reported as lowering its current forecast to zero
and maintaining its 1992 figure at Pounds 25m. However, Charterhouse was
said to have reduced its 1992 dividend expectation to 9.5p. Taylor Woodrow
shares dropped to 123p before closing a net 5 off at 128p, with turnover
reaching a heavy 6.5m.
BPB, Europe's biggest plasterboard manufacturer, settled 3 ahead at 147p,
after 150p, as the market reacted to suggestions that Knauf, the German
group seeking to expand its plasterboard operations in the UK and the rest
of Europe, has indicated it was about to increase its plasterboard prices by
up to 10 per cent.
Video distributor Pickwick surged ahead 67 to 240p after recommending
acceptance of a Pounds 67.8m bid from Carlton Communications, which added 11
at 569p with 2.2m traded.
Investment bank Kleinwort Benson strengthened its negative stance on Forte
and Ladbroke after new research indicated poor hotel occupancy rates,
particularly for London, in November and December. The outlook for January
is also weak. Forte slipped 2 1/2 to 230 1/2 p, while Ladbroke lost 3 to
216p.
Interest in selected property issues continued as buyers took account of
favourable interest rate comments and the sector's relative cheapness.
British Land added 11 at 272p, Great Portland rose 8 to 171p and MEPC gained
7 to 395p.
However, Chesterfield Property dropped 43 to 345p after one broker moved to
sell a line of stock and others followed suit on a stock which has been on a
number of brokers' sell lists.
Northern Foods gained 20 to 578p in response to a successful Pounds 227m
rights issue. The take-up of the company's offer was 91.4 per cent. The rump
of 3.3m shares was placed with institutions at 568p.
Food retailer J. Sainsbury was active, with 6.4m shares traded at 358p as
one half of a tax-related 'bed and breakfast' deal. The shares closed 5
higher at 369p.
WH Smith 'A' softened 2 to 459p ahead of today's interim figures.
Fisons rose 20 to 369p with 11m traded after stating that it would
recommence manufacture of its eye preparation Opticrom in the UK.
Lonrho rallied 6 to 1123 1/2 p on turnover of 12m shares, reflecting a
feeling that Friday's 30 per cent fall in the stock was overdone.
Industrial conglomerate Williams Holdings fell 11 to 312p after the UK
financial reporting review panel said Williams' 1990 accounts did not comply
with current company reporting rules.
Leather and hosiery group Hartstone jumped 20 on the announcement that its
Pounds 65m rights issue at 235p a share was 96.1 per cent taken up by
shareholders. The stock receded later to close 8 up at 277p. The rump of the
issue, just over 1.1m shares, was placed by BZW with around 20 institutions
at 284p a share.
Negative sentiment following a recent profits downgrade continued to affect
P & O, which slipped 5 to 435p, after falling 7 on Monday. Eurotunnel,
recommended by Charterhouse Tilney, its own broker, as a switch out of P &
O, which it downgraded, gained 12 to 469p.
Turnover in Rolls-Royce rose to 8.8m and the shares put on 8 to 144p as talk
of a dividend cut at the company continued to fade. Sentiment was also
helped by a recommendation of Rolls-Royce included in a review on the
aerospace sector by Charterhouse Tilney published yesterday.
T & N hardened 4 to 106p after County NatWest moved the stock from a sell to
a buy in a review of the motor sector.
The broker said: 'Underperformance of 42 per cent during 1991 has resulted
in a rating that does not reflect the group's recovery potential.'
