FT  05 JUN 92 / Fall persists in factory investment


   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff


INVESTMENT spending by British manufacturers will continue to fall this year
but will rise in 1993, according to the Central Statistical Office's spring
survey of manufacturers' investment intentions.
All industries except chemicals and mechanical engineering are expected to
invest less, with a fall of 2 per cent on last year predicted.
Biggest declines are expected in metals, food, drink and tobacco.
Respondents to the latest survey account for about a tenth of the capital
expenditure of the manufacturing industries.
Britain's longer leading index, which pinpoints turning points in economic
activity about 10 months in advance, rose 0.7 per cent in April to stand at
104.7.
