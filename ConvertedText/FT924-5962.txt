FT  24 NOV 92 / Letter: Government insensitive to BR fare rises and decline
in service


   From Mr DAVID ERDMAN


Sir, The recent announcement of 5,000 redundancies on the railways following
the 10 per cent fare increases by BR are further examples of the
insensitivity of the government to the effects of the current long
recession.
Over the three-year course of this recession, BR has been permitted to raise
fares by more than 30 per cent, literally driving many passengers on to
increasingly congested roads.
Few commercial organisations would attempt to combine these untimely efforts
to raise revenue while simultaneously cutting the quality of service. Yet BR
is operating 36-year-old rolling stock and signalling while reducing
maintenance staff, management, frequency of trains and station opening
times, and escalating fares to levels unseen elsewhere in Europe.
Meanwhile the government, apparently surprised by all of this, studiously
avoids any commitment to a Channel Tunnel link or new rolling stock for the
London, Tilbury and Southend line, choosing instead to hide behind its ever
slowing privatisation plans.
Why is the public transport lobby so feeble and when will the interests of
the millions of tax paying commuters be properly represented? Perhaps the
minister of public transport, or anyone sitting near him who reads the FT,
would address these issues and reply.
