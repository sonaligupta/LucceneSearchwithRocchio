FT  28 JUL 92 / Observer: Tasty morsels


Fancy eating a Mel Gibson? Or munching a Madonna?
No, not some form of perverse mastication but the latest in a trend so old
it has mould on it: the use of Hollywood as a means of inducing consumers to
part with cash.
'Celebrity Sandwiches', a lunchtime venue just opened in London's West End,
has cottoned onto the idea that the star-struck just can't get close enough
to their heroes and heroines; so why not eat them?
For Pounds 3.95 you can tuck into the Ivana Trump: 'A luxury you can't
divorce, double decker caviar and smoked salmon special.'
Surely writs will soon begin to fly, transatlantic-wise?
