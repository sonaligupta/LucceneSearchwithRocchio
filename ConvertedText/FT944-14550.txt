FT  22 OCT 94 / Ulster Peace Process: Change is mixed blessing for workforce


   By Our Belfast Correspondent


Ulster's so-called peace dividend will have mixed fortunes for Northern
Ireland's workforce.
While the Industrial Development Board, the province's main jobs agency, has
recently reported successes in attracting overseas investment, a number of
local companies are experiencing difficulties in securing orders.
Harland and Wolff, the Belfast shipbuilder which currently employs 2,000
people, has said recently it is prepared to build a ship at a loss in order
to protect continuity of employment.
Province-wide estimates suggest that employment in the security sector,
which includes the Royal Ulster Constabulary and private security firms
could fall by as much as 20,000.
Conversely, the tourism industry in Northern Ireland is expected to thrive
on the prospect of peace.
At present the industry employs about 10,000 people and is worth about
Pounds 130m to the local economy. It is felt these figures could double if
peace is genuine.
It has always been clear that the achievement of peace would lead to a
reassessment of public spending priorities in the province.
Yesterday the Northern Ireland Economic Council, in its Autumn Economic
Review made clear that the government should not consider removing money
from Northern Ireland.
Its report said: 'To argue that 'peace' will bring more costs than benefits
seems perverse in the extreme . . . What is important is that the adjustment
problems that will arise are dealt with carefully, sensitively and
gradually.
'With regard to the substantial opportunities that would open up in the
longer term, it is imperative that these are exploited to the full.'
The report maintained that the latest economic indicators appeared to
suggest that local manufacturing output was continuing to outperform
Britain.
