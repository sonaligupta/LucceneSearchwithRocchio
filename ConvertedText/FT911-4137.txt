FT  20 APR 91 / DSS man sees need for pensions test case


   By ERIC SHORT, Pensions Correspondent


A TEST case will be needed before the government can equalise state pension
ages for men and women, Sir Michael Partridge, permanent secretary at the
Department of Social Security, said yesterday.
He told delegates at the annual conference of the National Association of
Pension Funds in Torquay that was the way to resolve ambiguities over the
retrospection aspects of the Barber case heard by the European Court last
year.
Sir Michael's comments dashed hopes of early action by the government. He
said there was no simple way for a government to settle the uncertainties
arising from a particular European Court judgment.
Only the court itself could clarify its decision in the Barber case that
companies had to equalise pensions and other benefits for men and women. He
therefore saw no alternative to a test case. He explained to delegates that
a unit set up in the department to consider the judgment had identified the
requirements for a suitable test case. He was confident that, once such a
test case had been identified, it could be heard quickly by a court.
He indicated that the recent Roscoe v Hick Hargreaves decision by a
Manchester industrial tribunal, in which the effect of the Barber judgment
was made retrospective for people retiring after the date of the European
Court decision, was not a suitable case.
His comments go against recent demands by the pension managers of 18 large
UK corporate bodies for urgent action by the government to equalise state
pension ages, thereby removing the barriers preventing the Barber judgment
from being fully implemented in company schemes.
