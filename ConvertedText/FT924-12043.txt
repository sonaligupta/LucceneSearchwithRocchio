FT  22 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Talk of discount rate
cut lifts Tokyo stocks


   By EMIKO TERAZONO


   TOKYO


The Nikkei average closed above the 17,000 level on late investment trust
buying after a call by Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, for lower
money market rates spurred hopes of a cut in the official discount rate,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index advanced 153.86 to close at the day's high of 17,141.52, having
fallen to the day's low of 16,839.69 earlier in the afternoon.
Volume fell to 170m shares from 192m as advances led declines by 520 to 342
with 201 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks
gained 7.46 to 1,298.33 and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 1.03 to
1045.94.
Weak money supply figures, which registered a 0.4 per cent decline in
September, also added to hopes of lower rates. However, activity
concentrated on index-linked buying by investment trusts and overall trading
remained dull.
Interest rate-sensitive issues were heavily traded, with Sumitomo Metal
Industries, the most active issue of the day, rising Y8 to Y270. Nippon
Steel, however, fell Y1 to Y292 on profit taking.
Export-oriented, high-technology stocks were higher as the dollar
strengthened against the yen: Hitachi jumped Y14 to Y737 and NEC advanced Y9
to Y695.
Financials were stronger on hopes of better earnings due to lower interest
rates. Industrial Bank of Japan rose Y10 to Y2,440 and Mitsubishi Bank
gained Y50 to Y2,120.
Inabata, the chemical and pharmaceutical trading company, rose Y50 to Y1,170
on foreign buying. Inabata holds a stake in the unlisted Sumitomo
Pharmaceutical, which is a market leader in Interferon.
Clarion, the car audio maker, fell Y44 to Y455 on a downward revision of its
earnings estimates. Clarion is now forecasting a Y8.5bn after-tax loss for
the current year to next March.
In Osaka, the OSE average gained 65.40 to 18,726.96 in volume of 8.8m
shares.
Roundup
TOKYO's recovery helped to lift some of the region's markets yesterday.

funds for capital investment. Daewoo Heavy Industries gained Won400 to
