FT  19 APR 94 / Japanese trade surplus with Asia overtakes US figure

Japan's trade surplus with Asia surpassed that with the US for the first
time during the financial year that ended last month, according to the
Japanese finance ministry.
The figures demonstrate the rapid shifts in trading patterns among
high-growth countries of east Asia, and provide ammunition for governments
in the region that have become increasingly concerned at Japan's trade
surpluses.
The surplus with China, South Korea and the Association of South East Asian
Nations (Asean) during the 12 months to March 31 expanded 25.1 per cent last
year to Dollars 55.95bn (Pounds 38.3bn), while Japan's surplus with the US
was Dollars 51.14bn, up 11.8 per cent.
Finance ministry officials said the 12.2 per cent depreciation of the dollar
over the year was partly to blame, as the overall surplus during the
financial year fell 4.7 per cent to Y13,180bn, the first fall for three
years. However, in dollar terms, the surplus rose 10 per cent to a record
Dollars 122bn. Japan's trade surplus with Asia is being driven by a sharp
rise in consumer spending and capital investment in the area, and by the
building of Japanese plants to assemble products from components
manufactured in Japan.
Meanwhile, Japan's trade surplus with the US rose 20.8 per cent during March
to reach Dollars 4.96bn, raising the possibility of further pressure from
Washington for market-opening measures. The overall surplus for the month
reached a record Dollars 13.95bn, an increase of 4.2 per cent on a year
earlier.
The surplus with the US during March expanded on a 12.6 per cent increase in
Japanese exports to Dollars 10.6bn, reflecting stronger demand from the US
economy. However, imports rose only 6.1 per cent, as domestic demand
remained weak in Japan.
The latest data are a disappointment for Tokyo since they follow a 0.9 per
cent fall in the trade surplus with the US during February compared with the
same month in 1993. But Mr Tsutomu Hata, foreign minister, and tipped to
become the next premier, said existing trade policies would be maintained.
'Japan needs to tell the world that there will be no change in policy, and
that includes protecting free trade,' Mr Hata said.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary, warned that Washington would
continue to insist on Japan opening its markets.
