FT  04 SEP 93 / Thousands 'at risk' from drug-resistant TB


   By CLIVE COOKSON


TENS OF THOUSANDS of people in Britain could be at risk from drug-resistant
strains of tuberculosis, a leading TB specialist warned the British
Association meeting at Keele University.
Dr Tim Peto of Oxford University's Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine
said some patients in the US could not be treated effectively with any known
antibiotic. The UK has TB strains that are resistant to the best 'frontline'
drugs but they do succumb to 'secondline' antibiotics.
'The impact of multi-drug resistant strains of TB in Britain would be
immense,' Dr Peto said. 'The total cost of managing a major TB outbreak
would be huge.'
Infectious patients with resistant strains might need to be isolated for
long periods.
'Intensive health care would be needed to ensure that patients complied with
complicated drug regimens for many months in order to check the infection,'
Dr Peto said.
'In recent years we have seen the impact of HIV disease on public awareness
of the impact of sexual behaviour. It is difficult to predict what the
effect on society would be if a serious infectious disease emerged which is
spread simply by coughing, sneezing or talking.'
He blamed 'the inequality of health care in the US' for the emergence of
multi-resistant TB there. Those at risk in the UK - likely to be tens of
thousands - would be those who did not have regular access to NHS
facilities. The homeless were especially vulnerable.
A number of once-vanquished microbes that are now making a comeback, the
conference heard. Professor Michael Levin of St Mary's Hospital Medical
School, London said: 'In the past 20 years we have witnessed a dramatic and
frightening re-emergence of infectious diseases as major forces against
which mankind must struggle for survival.'
He said many old diseases had returned and a host of new infectious
diseases, which were not dreamed of 15 years ago, had appeared.
