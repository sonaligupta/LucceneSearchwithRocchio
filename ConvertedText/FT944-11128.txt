FT  08 NOV 94 / Traineeships sail off down the Tyne


   By CHRIS TIGHE


The workforce of Tyneside shipbuilder Swan Hunter has been reduced to a
skeleton since receivership, but one group remains - the trainees who were
the company's stake in the future.
Redundancies have cut employees from 2,400 on receivership in May last year
to less than 350 now, and 220 of those will lose their jobs on Friday.
But through all the trauma of the past 18 months, the trainees have worked
on to gain the craft skills which, they hope, will give them the chance of a
working life.
Now, with Swans' last ship, the Type 23 frigate Richmond, gone from the Tyne
and the company's demise drawing near, the unions and the Tyneside Training
and Enterprise Council are searching for new employers for the trainees.
The Swans' Traineeship, launched in late 1991, superseded the traditional
shipyard apprenticeship by offering a flexible, standards-based, three-year
programme leading to nationally recognised vocational qualifications.
Formulated with strong support from the unions, which described it as 'a
scheme with a future', it recruited 18-year-old trainees in 1991 and 1992.
So far, Mr Dick Gonsalez, a union leader, has found work for three trainees
with North Tyneside Council; 18 remain, including six about to complete
their three years' training.
One of them, 21-year-old electrician Mr Mark Bennett, said he was grateful
the trainees had been kept on, although the uncertainty and the sight of
skilled people losing their jobs had been hard.
His ambition to become a chartered engineer remains unshaken. 'We were taken
on to carry the industry forward into the future,' he said.
Miss Amanda Redmond, another electrician and the only female trainee, said
the collapse of Swan Hunter had been heartbreaking. 'You learn a lot about
life the hard way.'
