FT  19 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Women win ruling on retirement


   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff


BRITISH GAS must compensate six women pensioners who were forced to retire
at 60, the law lords ruled yesterday at the end of a five-year legal battle.
The women, who were all employed by British Gas before privatisation, took
their case to an industrial tribunal in 1986.
It dismissed their complaint of sex discrimination and the case was pursued
through the UK legal system and the European Court before returning to the
House of Lords.
Four law lords ruled unanimously yesterday that British Gas, as successor to
the state-owned corporation, should compensate the women under EC law. An
industrial tribunal will decide how much should be awarded.
The six, all compulsorily retired between December 1985 and July 1986, were
backed by Nalgo, the public-sector union.
Lord Templeman said the 1986 Sex Discrimination Act, which came into force
in November 1987 after the women retired, made different retirement ages for
men and women unlawful.
Before that, public-sector (but not private-sector) employees could rely on
a 1976 directive of the European Court guaranteeing equal treatment for men
and women in working conditions and regarding dismissal. The question in the
present case was whether the old corporation was a 'body made responsible
for providing a public service under the control of the state'.
The women's claims were originally dismissed on the grounds that the
corporation was a statutory body engaged in commercial activities and not an
agent of the state.
