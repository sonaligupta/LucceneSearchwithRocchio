FT  14 APR 94 / Mersey Docks director resigns


   By STEWART DALBY


Mr Peter Vincent yesterday resigned from the board of Mersey Docks and
Harbour Company only six months after joining the company following MDHC's
takeover of his Medway Ports company, Stewart Dalby writes.
Mr Vincent's resignation from MDHC, in which he owned nearly 1 per cent of
the ordinary shares and was thought to be the largest private
non-institutional shareholder, was said to be so he could develop 'other
interests'. Mr Vincent's appointment was surrounded in controversy because
of the terms of the takeover.
MDHC purchased Medway Ports, which has docks in Sheerness and Chatham in
Kent, for Pounds 104m in September 1993, valuing the shares at Pounds 37.50,
making Mr Vincent's own holding worth Pounds 12m.
But 270 dockers - dismissed in November 1992 for refusing to accept new
working practices - were obliged to sell back shares which they had been
given or bought at privatisation in March 1992. These were valued at Pounds
2.50 each which meant the dockers missed out on profits made by Mr Vincent
and other staff.
