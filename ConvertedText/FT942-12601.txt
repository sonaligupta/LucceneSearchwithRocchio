FT  28 APR 94 / World Stock Markets: Venezuelan markets stagger in wake of
resignation


Venezuela
Financial markets reeled following the resignation of Ms Ruth de Krivoy,
president of the central bank, which traders interpreted as a vote of
no-confidence in government economic policy, analysts said.
The Caracas Stock Exchange registered sharp losses, with the Merinvest
independent index plunging 4.28 per cent downward to close at 108.90.
Ms de Krivoy, who assumed the central bank presidency in April 1992, had
kept monetary policy tight to bring down inflation, now at an annual rate of
45 percent, and to protect foreign reserves.
The bolivar came under immediate pressure, weakening 0.20 against the US
dollar in the morning to trade at 117.45/117.55 in banks.
Canada
With Wall Street closed, Toronto stocks rose in quiet trading, with the
market focusing on a flood of first-quarter financial results. The TSE 300
index added 23.97 points, or 0.56 per cent, to 4,287.77.
Advances led declines 398 to 306, volume of 42.29m shares compared with
Tuesday's 65.01m, and trading value was CDollars 504.9m against CDollars
870.1m.
Ten of the 14 stock groups rose and one was unchanged. Mining gained 1.24
per cent, industrial products, golds, banks and consumer products were
somewhat higher, and energy stocks were flat.
Mexico
Stocks closed higher, but off their session highs, following a drop in
short-term Mexican interest rates and remarks by Mr Pedro Aspe, Finance
Minister, that Mexican interest rates had peaked.
The 36-share IPC index closed up 48.65 points, or 2.13 per cent, at 2,332.78
after pulling back from a high of 2,363.87 around midday.
