FT  12 MAR 92 / Letter: Purcell enters political arena


   From Mr ROBERT KING


Sir, The Labour party spokesman who recently described John Major's new
signature tune as suitable only 'for wine bars' writes off the music of
Britain's greatest composer in one remarkably ill-judged phrase.
After 10 intensive years recording and performing Purcell's music, I find it
gratifying finally to find his name on everybody's lips and making headline
news for the first time since the composer's early demise in 1695.
The Labour spokesman may be a Philistine (or just a closet Haydn buff?) but
might now ruefully consider Purcell's verse anthem 'Be merciful unto me' or
even the song of 1678 'Sweet Tyranness, I now resign'.
A smarting Purcell would probably look to the anthem written two years later
and entitled 'Lord, I can suffer thy rebukes', whilst an internal Labour
party enquiry could examine the Ode of 1682 - 'What shall be done in behalf
of the man?'
