FT  12 NOV 92 / International Company News: Dah Sing agrees to buy Wing On
for HKDollars 530m


   By REUTER


HANG Seng Bank has accepted an offer by Dah Sing Financial Holdings to buy
its Wing On Bank unit, Reuter reports.
The bank said no final price had been decided, but Dah Sing would probably
pay about HKDollars 30.13 each for 17.6m shares, making the offer worth
about HKDollars 530m (USDollars 68.8m).
Hang Seng, which is 68 per cent owned by HSBC Holdings, holds 50.3 per cent
of Wing On. It said Dah Sing would make a cash offer for remaining shares in
Wing On. The total offer would value the bank at more than HKDollars 1.05bn.
Hang Seng rescued Wing On in 1986 after it ran into financial trouble.
Dah Sing, which owns Hongkong Industrial and Commercial Bank, announced in
March net annual profits of HKDollars 159.81m, compared with HKDollars
119.20 the previous year.
Hang Seng said the Hong Kong Commissioner of Banking had indicated his
approval of the takeover but had yet to be approached for a formal ruling.
