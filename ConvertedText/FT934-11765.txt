FT  29 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Regal Hotel reduces deficit


IN ITS first set of results since undergoing a restructuring in December
1992, Regal Hotel Group, the USM-quoted hotel operator, reported pre-tax
losses of Pounds 403,000 for the half year to July 4 against losses of
Pounds 663,000.
Stripping out the results of Bramhope, its wholly owned trading company
which had been ring-fenced, the losses are Pounds 181,000, representing
Regal's continuing operations.
The company said it had ceased to treat Bramhope as a subsidiary with effect
from March 25 in accordance with FRS 2.
Mr Keith Goldie-Morrison, chairman, said the acquisitions, Catermax and
Woodmount, contributed to the accounts from March 24 and Dudley Hotels from
May 11. He added that the second half should see an acceleration of the
acquisition programme.
Turnover was Pounds 1.23m (Pounds 1.5m), with ongoing activities
contributing Pounds 674,000. Losses per share fell to 0.17p (6.2p).
