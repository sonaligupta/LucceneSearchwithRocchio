FT  18 APR 94 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (5): Triple offensive -
Japan-UK plants chase bulk sale


   By KEVIN DONE


The three Japanese carmakers - Nissan, Toyota and Honda - are seeking to
increase significantly their presence in the UK fleet market as output grows
from their UK car assembly plants.
The fleet market - defined as sales to companies running 25 or more vehicles
 -accounted last year for 42 per cent of the overall UK new car market of
1.78m. Its share has jumped from only 27 per cent in 1987.
The business market - defined as sales to companies running between two and
24 vehicles - accounted for additional sales of around 350,000.
Nissan, which has the largest share of any Japanese carmaker in both the UK
and in west Europe, estimates that two out of every three new car purchases
in the UK are made with company money.
These sectors cannot be ignored by any of the world's leading carmakers
aiming to capture a significant share of the UK new car market.
As long as the Japanese car producers were constrained by quota limits on
direct vehicle exports from Japan, they preferred to direct their main
attention to the retail market, but that picture is now changing
dramatically, as they build up local sources of production in Europe.
Nissan, Toyota and Honda have their first European car assembly plants in
operation and they are all located in the UK. As far as the fleet market is
concerned, this gives them the opportunity of breaking through any remaining
prejudices on the part of the big fleets against buying cars that are not
British or European-built.
The quota restraints on direct exports from Japan are in any case being
eased, as the European Union moves towards removing all restrictions on car
imports by the end of 1999. In the case of Nissan, the remaining quota
restrictions are already of little significance for its UK sales efforts,
however, as 70 per cent of the vehicles it sells in Britain are now
European-built.
It was the first Japanese carmaker to begin car production in Europe in
1986, and by last year its output in the UK had jumped to 246,281 of which
74 per cent were exported.
Honda and Toyota both began car production in the UK in late 1992. Toyota
output at its plant at Burnaston, near Derby, totalled 37,314 last year and
is forecast to rise to 100,000 this year. Honda produced 32,139 cars at its
plant at Swindon, Wiltshire, last year and this is expected to reach 100,000
in 1995, when it adds assembly of a second car range.
All three Japanese carmakers chose large family cars as their first models
for local production in Europe, models which sell to the heart of the fleet
market. The Nissan Primera, the Toyota Carina E, and the Honda Accord are
competing directly with the best-selling fleet cars of Ford and Vauxhall,
the Mondeo and the Cavalier.
Honda claims that it is targeting the user-chooser company car driver rather
than the large fleets, which have only one of two makes. 'There is little
profit in that sector,' it says, 'and competition between Ford and Vauxhall
is cut-throat.' It expects around 50 per cent of the UK sales of its
Swindon-produced Accord to be company purchases.
Honda says that it cannot match Ford and Vauxhall discounts, but it claims
that the overall running costs of the Accord are lower than for its rivals
because of better second-hand values.
Nissan has faced a particular sales and marketing challenge in Britain, as
it seeks to re-build its share of the UK market following the setbacks it
suffered during its long-running legal battle with Nissan UK, its former
independent importer/distributor controlled by Mr Octav Botnar.
It has only held direct control of its UK sales and marketing operations
since the beginning of 1992, when it started with a total of 150 dealers.
Nissan's share of the UK new car market had held steady at around 6 per cent
throughout the 1980s, but slipped to only 4 per cent in 1991 at the height
of its conflict with Mr Botnar.
With an expanded dealer network - it is being increased from 294 at present
to 330 by the end of the year - Nissan is aiming to raise its share of the
UK new car market to 5.5 per cent in 1994 from 5 per cent last year and 4.7
per cent in 1992 according to Mr Andy Green, sales director of Nissan Motor
(GB).
As part of this effort it is increasing its presence in particular in the
fleet market. Mr Green forecasts that fleet sales will account for 25 per
cent of Nissan's new car sales this year compared with less than 20 per cent
in 1993.
While the fleet sales market is dominated by the traditional big four groups
in the UK new car market, Ford, General Motors (Vauxhall), Rover and the PSA
Peugeot Citroen group of France, the Japanese carmakers are beginning to
gain ground.
Ford, Vauxhall and Rover all lost share in the fleet market last year. By
contrast Nissan raised its share to 2.7 per cent from 1.6 per cent a year
earlier, while Toyota increased its share to 1.6 per cent from 1.0 per cent
in 1992. The earlier dominance of Ford, Vauxhall and Rover in the fleet
market has been undermined, and the share of these three has fallen from 89
per cent in 1987 to 69.3 per cent last year.
Nissan has raised its fleet car sales from 5,431 in 1991 - the low point
when it was still immersed in its legal fight to take control of the
franchise - to 10,890 in 1992 and 19,939 last year.
According to Mr Simon Rutherford, NMGB national fleet sales manager, Nissan
is aiming to increase its fleet sales to around 24,000 this year to claim
around 3 per cent of the fleet market.
Nissan has built up a 16-strong fleet sales department including six field
staff, and is now running a fleet of 400 demonstrator vehicles. Two managers
specialise in looking after the top 80 contract hire and leasing companies
in the country.
Having reached its initial targets in the market for large fleets, Nissan
has also started to pay more attention to the local business and medium
fleet sectors with the launch of its Nissan In Business dealer programme. To
date 52 of its larger dealers have been selected to join the initiative,
which is designed to complement the group's national fleet activities and
build more company sales in local markets.
Toyota started preparing its fleet sales activities in 1990 in preparation
for the start of production of the Carina E in the UK at the end of 1992. In
1990 its fleet sales totalled only 1,326, but sales have doubled each year
since to 2,690 in 1991, 6,521 in 1992 and 12,120 last year.
In the same period the share of Toyota's UK sales derived from the fleet
market has risen from 3 per cent in 1990 to 23 per cent last year, while its
share of the overall UK fleet market has jumped from 0.2 per cent to 1.6 per
cent in the same period.
Toyota is aiming to increase its fleet sales again this year by close to 50
per cent to 18,000 according to Mr Brian Mahony, Toyota (GB)'s corporate
business director. He expects fleet sales to be accounting for as much as 30
per cent of Toyota's total UK car sales by the end of the year with the
share reaching as much as one-third over the longer-term.
The UK-produced Carina is accounting for 55-60 per cent of Toyota's fleet
sales, and half of the group's fleet sales are to contract hire and leasing
companies.
From one person in 1990 the Toyota (GB) fleet sales department has grown to
14, its fleet of demonstrator vehicles has jumped from 8 to 200, and its
database of potential fleet customers has climbed from 1,200 to 11,500.
Toyota has chosen 80 dealers from its 270-strong network as its main
strategic fleet dealers, and it is here that it has concentrated its
specialist training efforts. 'We are now a player in this market, and we are
going forward carefully and comfortably,' says Mr Mahony.
