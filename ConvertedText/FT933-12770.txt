FT  22 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Worthington looks to current year


WORTHINGTON Group, the Staffordshire-based textile accessories company, saw
pre-tax profits tumble 38 per cent over the 12 months to March 31.
The decline - from a restated Pounds 1.06m to Pounds 652,000 - reflected the
continuing disappointing performance of the button wholesaling and trimming
operations.
However, Mr Jack Grant, chairman, sounded an optimistic note: 'The first
quarter of the current year has seen significant improvements in all trading
operations . . . problems in our button business appear to have now been
resolved.'
Turnover improved to Pounds 14m (Pounds 13.6m). Comparisons for the previous
year were restated to allow for the merger accounting of Hulme Holmberg and
Atorp, acquired in August.
Mr Grant said the group planned further expansion, both through organic
growth and acquisition.
The final dividend is held at 1.1p making a total of 1.6p (1.4p), payable
from earnings of 3p (4.3p) per share.
