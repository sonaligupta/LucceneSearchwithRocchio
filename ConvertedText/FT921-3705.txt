FT  13 MAR 92 / World Trade News: India urged to defer 20% tourist tax


   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER


UK-BASED travel companies have written to the Indian government warning that
a proposed 20 per cent expenditure tax on hotel food and accommodation for
foreign visitors could damage the country's tourist industry, writes Michael
Skapinker.
The protest against the tax, led by Cox & Kings, the market leader in Indian
holidays, has been supported by Thomas Cook, British Airways Holidays, Kuoni
and others. The International Federation of Tour Operators has warned that
the tax could cut the number of foreign visitors to India.
In letters to Mr Manmohan Singh, India's finance minister, and Mr Madhavrao
Scindia, civil aviation and tourism minister, Mr Peter Kerkar, Cox & Kings'
chief executive, said much of the increase in costs caused by the tax would
be passed on to consumers, adding: 'the foreign exchange generated . . .
will be affected by the negative impact that this levy will have upon new
business.'
Mr Kerkar asked India to consider deferring the tax until the end of 1993,
so that it could be included in new brochures, and to reduce its level.
Britons made up about one-fifth of the country's 1.2m visitors, he said.
