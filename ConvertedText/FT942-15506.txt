FT  14 APR 94 / Taiwan halts tours to China

   TAIPEI


Taiwan will suspend all tours to China from next month over Beijing's
handling of a mysterious boat fire which killed 24 Taiwanese tourists last
month, the government announced yesterday, Reuter reports from Taipei.
'The incident has initiated indignation and the government supports the
decision by the travel agents' association to suspend tour groups to the
mainland starting on May 1,' Mr Chang Tzu-chiang, director of the Tourism
Bureau, said.
Taiwan Governor James Soong told the Provincial Assembly that visits by
civil servants to China would be suspended from next week. Taiwanese made
about 1m trips to China last year, down from 1.5m in 1992.
The victims burned to death or drowned when a fire started on a boat on
Qiandao lake in the central province of Zhejiang on March 31.
Relatives of the victims returned to Taiwan last week with cremated remains,
accusing Chinese authorities of covering up what they said was mass murder
and restricting their movement. China on Saturday acknowledged the blaze
could have been caused by saboteurs and promised the culprits would be
punished.
