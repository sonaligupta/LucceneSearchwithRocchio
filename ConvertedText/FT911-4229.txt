FT  20 APR 91 / International Company News: Caterpillar loss of Dollars 32m
in line with forecasts

CATERPILLAR, the world's biggest manufacturer of earth-moving equipment,
yesterday unveiled a first-quarter net loss of Dollars 32m, or 32 cents a
share, compared with net income of Dollars 99m, or 97 cents, in the first
three months of last year.
Sales fell 9 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 2.68bn from Dollars 2.94bn.
Earlier this month the Peoria, Illinois-based company had warned that weak
market conditions would push it into the red in the first quarter, and the
results were in line with these expectations.
Caterpillar's first-quarter results also reflect a one-time pre-tax charge
of Dollars 21m related to the consolidation of its building construction
products division in North America.
The company's operating profit slumped to Dollars 16m in the first three
months of 1991 from Dollars 148m. Weakness in US construction activity
depressed Caterpillar's US sales by 20 per cent in the 1991 quarter to
Dollars 1.08bn.
The company attributed the erosion of sales and revenues to a 13 per cent
decline in physical sales volume, reflecting the recession in the US and
other industrialised countries and the sharp deterioration of the Brazilian
economy. However, lower volume was partly offset by a 3 per cent increase in
realised prices, thanks to favourable dollar translations and price
increases.
The company also benefited from an Dollars 18m increase in revenues from
financial subsidiaries.
A striking feature of the results for the first quarter was the drop in
other income to Dollars 7m from Dollars 53m. The deterioration was blamed on
exchange losses on European currencies in the first quarter compared with
gains a year earlier.
Caterpillar's outlook for the rest of 1991 appears difficult, even if the US
economy improves significantly, since construction tends to lag behind any
improvement in the rest of the economy.
Mr Eli Lustgarten, an analyst at PaineWebber in New York, has not changed
his earnings estimate of Dollars 1-a-share in 1991 for Caterpillar, 'but
that will be a challenge,' he said. In 1990, Caterpillar had net income per
share of Dollars 2.07.
