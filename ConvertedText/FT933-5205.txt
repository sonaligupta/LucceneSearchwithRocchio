FT  04 SEP 93 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): LME copper market crisis
deferred


   By RICHARD MOONEY


THE LONDON Metal Exchange copper market survived a crisis this week, but
remained in a critical condition.
Despite an undeniably bearish fundamental situation - underlined yesterday
by the announcement a further 72,50-tonne rise in exchange warehouse stocks
to 524,500 tonnes - the market had been propped up for some months by a
developing supply 'squeeze', centred on the September delivery period.
The crunch was supposed to come this Wednesday, declaration day for
September options.
In event the day passed quietly, but traders suggested that the crisis had
only been deferred, with the bulk of the options being rolled forward to the
October/December period. 'There is still the potential for mayhem in the
market,' commented Mr Wictor Bielski, analyst at Bain and Company, part of
the Deutsche Bank group. 'These situations tend not to unwind themselves
without doing some damage to some players.'
At the end of July the LME management attempted to avoid that damage by
issuing a warning that it would use its draconian powers to cool the
situation if the supposed manipulators did not loosen their grip on the
market.
In 1991 it responded to a similar squeeze by imposing a Pounds 25 limit on
the daily 'backwardation' (premium for immediate delivery). The latest
squeeze has not yet become so serious as to provoke a repeat of that action,
but it has persisted for an uncomfortably long period. And in the five weeks
since Mr David King, the LME chief executive, issued his warning the
technical tightness appears to have become worse.
By that time that cash price discount to the three months delivery price,
which would be regarded as normal when supplies are adequate, had
disappeared. But since then the cash/three months spread, far from returning
to normal, has moved to a premium of as much as Dollars 42 a tonne - it
ended yesterday at Dollars 39.75.
The three-months price closed yesterday at Dollars 1,954.75 a tonne, up
Dollars 23.25 on the week, after being supported by what dealers described
as 'influential' cash buying.
There was little buying, whether influential or otherwise to support the LME
tin market, which continued to wilt under pressure from Chinese exports. The
three months delivery price closed yesterday at a 20-year low of Dollars
4,642.50 a tonne, down Dollars 95 on the week.
The LME nickel market resumed trading after the bank holiday weekend in a
less bearish mood and by Wednesday's close the three months position had
rallied Dollars 60.50 from Friday's 6-year low. The rise continued in early
trading on Thursday, but then it ran into merchant selling and profit-taking
and by yesterday's close it was at a fresh low of Dollars 4,517.50 a tonne,
down Dollars 27.50 on the week.
Dealers noted that a further hefty increase of 1,176 tonnes in LME stocks to
a record 107,436 tonnes added to the downward pressure.
A big stocks rise also undermined a tentative rally in the aluminium market,
which had recovered modest losses sustained in the first half of the week.
News of a 71,475-tonne stocks rise to a new record of 2,113,175 tonnes was
not unexpected and was initially shrugged off. Dealers explained that the
apparent influx largely reflected the placing on warrant South American
metal that was already in the warehouses. Nevertheless the market's defiance
eventually gave way and the three months price closed at Dollars 1,162.25 a
tonne, Dollars down Dollars 8.25 on the day and Dollars 7.25 on the week.
For the gold market this was a week of contrasts. It began with the London
bullion market price pushing back above the Dollars 370-a-troy-ounce support
level that gave way late last week, reaching Dollars 371.35 an ounce at
Tuesday's close. But the speculative sellers were quickly back in the game
and they scored a notable success when they forced the December futures
position in New York down through Dollars 370 on Thursday. That prompted a
wave of selling that took the London price to Dollars 361.50 at one stage
and left it at Dollars 364.25 at yesterday's close, down Dollars 4.75 on the
week.
Gold's breakdown in New York was closely linked to a bout of technical
selling in the silver market, which pushed the London price to Dollars 4.35
at one time - the two metals are often interlinked in investment fund
computer programmes. Unlike gold, however, silver continued Thursday's late
rally yesterday and ended yesterday at Dollars 4.57 1/2 an ounce, down 12
cents on the week.
At the London Commodity Exchange the robusta coffee market yesterday
suffered the technical sell-off that many dealers had been expecting
following the dramatic rise of recent weeks. The November futures position,
which had risen Dollars 180 in two weeks, ended the day Dollars 36 lower at
Dollars 1,228 a tonne, down Dollars 53 on the week.
The LCE cocoa market had also shed some of its recent gains, but a Pounds 6
rally yesterday left only Pounds 5 down on balance at Pounds 826 a tonne.
The LCE announced yesterday that its board had agreed to the launch of a new
raw sugar contract, to replace the one that was scrapped in April after
failing to make the transition back from screen to floor trading.
Support for listing raw sugar futures has increased following a dispute in
the New York market over a decision to allow the delivery of Brazilian
crystal sugar as raws, much against the wishes of many traders. The new
contract will be designed to trade at a premium over New York raws.
