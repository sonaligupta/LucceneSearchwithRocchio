VITAL Forsikring, the Norwegian insurer, yesterday reported a rise in 1992
net profit, after allocations to shareholders and policyholders, to NKr723m
(Dollars 103m) from NKr644m in 1991.
Mr Bjoern Elvestad, chief executive, said: 'We are not satisfied with the
rate of return on the company's funds in 1992, but the developments in the
financial markets since the turn of the year show how quickly the picture
can change.' Mr Elvestad said that at the end of this February the company's
securities investments, including realised and unrealised items, amounted to
NKr840m.
Allocations to shareholders fell last year to NKr126m from NKr218m in the
previous year while those to policyholders rose to NKr655m from NKr173m. The
board proposed a dividend of NKr4.75 a share, unchanged from 1991.
Group operating profit advanced to NKr824m in 1992 from NKr718m in 1991,
while premium income increased by NKr79m to NKr2.802bn.
Gross financial income rose by NKr78m, or by 3.8 per cent, to NKr2.625bn.
Vital said it wrote down the value of shareholdings by NKr186m, with
Eiendomsspar, in which it holds a 32 per cent stake, accounting for NKr133m
of the total.
Vital also wrote down the value of its real estate portfolio by NKr70m. 'In
addition, the portfolio reserve has been reduced by NKr36m,' Vital said.
Following these write-downs, the book value of the company's directly-owned
properties is NKr1.633bn, against NKr1.619bn in 1991.
The insurer said actual and estimated losses on residential and commercial
property were NKr34m, NKr12m more than in 1991, representing 0.24 per cent
of total loans. Vital said it wrote down by NKr40m a NKr50m short-term loan
to Investa, the collapsed Norwegian investment company.
Group assets rose last year to NKr35.136bn from NKr33.722bn a year earlier.
