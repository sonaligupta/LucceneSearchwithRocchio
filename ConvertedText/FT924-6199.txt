FT  23 NOV 92 / 'Low' chance of inflation rise


THE probability of a significant rise in inflation over the next 12 months
is low, even though the pound has been devalued by about 15 per cent since
suspension from the ERM, a London Business School report says today. There
might be an adverse effect on inflation by 1994-95.
The report suggests that 'on monetary policy, the government may have done
too much and on fiscal policy it may have done too little in the short
term', while providing no credible medium-term policy to cut the budget
deficit.
