FT  12 MAR 93 / Portugal bank resignations reported


   By REUTER


   LISBON


THE governor of the Bank of Portugal, Mr Miguel Beleza, was reported
yesterday to have resigned, along with his deputy, Mr Antonio Borges, whose
resignation was confirmed by the Ministry of Finance, Reuter reports from
Lisbon.
The two bankers were said to have stepped down following policy
disagreements with the finance minister, Mr Jorge Braga de Macedo.
Portugal's TSF Radio said the governor had handed in a letter of
resignation, although there was no official confirmation or denial of his
move. However, the ministry of finance, confirmed that his deputy, Mr
Borges, had decided to quit. The statement added that the ministry would
recommend that the cabinet accept the resignation.
Rumours that Mr Borges might resign circulated last Friday after Mr Jorge
Braga de Macedo, made a speech in which he urged the central bank to take
into account the real economy in its monetary policy.
'The Bank of Portugal cannot underestimate the negative signs of the real
economy which accumulated throughout 1992,' Mr Braga de Macedo had said. The
finance minister added that the central bank had 'underestimated noisy signs
from agriculture, trade and industry'. Mr Beleza was appointed central bank
governor in mid-1992, two years after Mr Borges became vice-governor.
Mr Borges handed in his resignation letter last week.
