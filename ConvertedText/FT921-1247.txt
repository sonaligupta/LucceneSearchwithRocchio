   MELBOURNE


BTR Nylex, the Australian manufacturing and packaging concern which is 64
per cent owned by BTR of the UK, is to bid for the minority shares in
Westinghouse Brake and Signal (Australia), Reuter reports from Melbourne.
The move follows a Pounds 1.5bn takeover by BTR of Hawker Siddeley, the UK
aerospace group, which held 85 per cent of Westinghouse.
BTR Nylex said it would offer ADollars 10 cash for each Westinghouse share,
with an alternative offer of BTR Nylex shares. But it did not elaborate on
the scrip offer.
BTR Nylex said the number of shares on issue was 7.8m. Westinghouse Brake
and Signal shares last traded on February 28 at ADollars 8.20.
BTR Nylex said: 'The acquisition of Westinghouse enables us to secure a
significant expansion of our existing rail businesses in the rapidly growing
Australian and Pacific Rim markets.'
It said Westinghouse had a strong technology manufacturing base in
Australia. 'Nylex has the management capability to ensure an enhancement of
its earnings from the development of these combined resources.'
BTR Nylex said it expected the formal offer document would be lodged no
later than March 30 and the formal offer to be made to Westinghouse
shareholders by no later than April 13.
