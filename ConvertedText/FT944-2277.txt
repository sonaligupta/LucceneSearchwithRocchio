FT  16 DEC 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool


World demand for wool at auctions around the world has been strong enough to
maintain prices in the final week before the Christmas recess in the selling
season. Merinos have tended very slightly dearer from time to time, New
Zealand crossbreds tended to ease again, and some British wools sold at
usefully higher prices at this week's Bradford auction. With British wool
demand stemmed originally from China rather than local processors who
normally dominate this sector. Elsewhere in the raw wool market is not
reflected in current demand from the retail end of the trade. Trading
conditions in the high street are extremely competitive and the
manufacturing industry continues to find it very difficult to pass on cost
increases in wool, with currency rates adding to the rises, as well as rises
in other fibre costs.
