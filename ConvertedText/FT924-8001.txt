FT  13 NOV 92 / Letter: In the US, real Republicans prefer to drink red wine


   From Mr DOUG HENWOOD


Sir, In one of your articles on this stupid US-EC trade war ('Wine importers
see risk of going into the red', November 7), your correspondents Alan
Friedman and Louise Kehoe declare that 'US white wine is a more palatable
alternative to European whites than is US red wine'. If this represents
official Bush administration reasoning, then it's yet another reason to
cheer its forced retirement come January. If it represents your
correspondents' opinion, then I can only assume that deadline pressures
prevented them from researching the matter adequately. The pain of living in
a weak-currency country would be even more intense than it is already if the
US didn't produce excellent red wines.
My own guess is that the Bushites consider white wine ideologically suspect,
the preferred beverage of intellectuals, aesthetes, vegetarians, women and
liberal democrats. By contrast, real Republicans drink manly reds with their
blood-rare steaks.
