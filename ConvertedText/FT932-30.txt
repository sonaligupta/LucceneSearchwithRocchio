FT  30 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Construction raids sink
Nikkei at close


   By REUTER


   TOKYO


STOCKS ended sharply lower on reports that four major construction companies
had been raided by prosecutors on bribery charges, Reuter reports from
Tokyo.
Prices also fell on arbitrage unwinding and profit-taking in thin trade as
investors grew wary over political worries.
The Nikkei average finished down 343.34, or 1.7 per cent, at the day's low
of 19,543.42, after a day's high of 19,854.93. Volume was 220m shares with
declining issues leading advancers by three to one.
The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 19.21 or 1.2 per cent at
1,581.26 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.09 to 1,196.67.
The market opened lower following the fall in Nikkei futures in Chicago
overnight and failed to recover the opening level all morning due to
arbitrage unwinding and profit-taking. Prices fell sharply before the close
on news that four major construction groups had been raided by prosecutors
on bribery charges.
According to a television report, state prosecutors had arrested senior
officials of some construction companies for alleged involvement in the
bribery of the mayor of a city in northern Japan.
The construction scandal renewed concern over domestic politics after
investors had been relieved on Monday following the better than expected
results in Sunday's Tokyo city elections.
Brokers said that investors were also wary about taking fresh positions
ahead of the G7 summit in Tokyo next week.
Construction stocks lost ground: Nishimatsu Construction fell Y80 to Y1,010,
Mitsui Construction by Y34 to Y505 and Shimizu by Y50 to Y820.
Bridgestone, which cut its outlook on parent profits by some 30 per cent on
Monday, slipped Y50 to Y1,240.
Kawasaki Steel slid Y3 to Y355, NKK also lost Y3 to Y309, and Kobe Steel
fell Y15 to Y330 after the three companies announced group losses.
Banking shares fell on profit-taking on expectations of a discount rate cut
in the near future. Sanwa Bank and Tokai Bank slipped Y50 to Y2,230 and
Y1,390 respectively.
