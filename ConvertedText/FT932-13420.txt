FT  23 APR 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): White mineral blocks the sun


   By DELLA BRADSHAW


For those who spend their summer holidays worrying whether the sun is
damaging their skin, Masta, part of the London School of Hygiene and
Tropical Medicine, has developed a sunblock which, it believes, has
advantages over existing cosmetic creams.
The lotion, a healthcare rather than a cosmetic preparation, contains the
mineral titanium dioxide. It provides a sun protection factor of 15 against
UVA and UVB rays.
Titanium dioxide provides the white pigment in paint. In the adult
formulation of the lotion the whitening is minimised, but for children it is
retained to indicate whether the child's skin has been completely covered.
Masta: UK, 071 631 4408.
