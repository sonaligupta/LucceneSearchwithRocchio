FT  06 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Carr's Milling up to Pounds 125,000


CARR'S MILLING Industries, the Carlisle-based miller, baker and animal feed
maker, more than doubled pre-tax profits to Pounds 125,000 in the half year
to February 29. Last time profits were Pounds 52,000.
The result was after bakery rationalisation and redundancy costs of Pounds
102,000 and charges of Pounds 99,000 connected with a 1989 wheat contract
which had gone to arbitration.
Turnover improved to Pounds 38.9m (Pounds 37.6m) including Pounds 3.78m
(Pounds 3.66m) inter-company reprocessing sales.
Intense competition in the flour milling and baking businesses had continued
to affect margins, the company said. Volumes, however, had been maintained.
The egg laying and packing subsidiary had produced 'disappointing' results
while the engineering and restaurant businesses had traded well.
Earnings per share emerged at 1.5p (0.8p losses) and the directors are
holding the interim dividend at 1p.
