FT  01 NOV 93 / US airline threatened with strike

   DALLAS


AMERICAN Airlines, the second biggest US carrier, faces the threat of a
strike by its 21,000 flight attendants following the collapse of talks on a
cost-cutting pay and conditions deal at the weekend.
The strike could cause chaos for US air travellers because it is set to
begin on or before November 22, the Monday before the Thanksgiving holiday
weekend - one of the busiest travel weekends.
The dispute casts a shadow over attempts by beleaguered US airlines to
restore profitability through deals aimed at big cuts in labour costs.
United Airlines is currently trying to persuade its employees to agree to
Dollars 4bn worth of cuts in jobs and pay in exchange for a stake of up to
60 per cent in the ownership of the company.
American Airlines has been talking to its unions for a year about new
conditions of employment that would cut labour costs by 20 per cent.
