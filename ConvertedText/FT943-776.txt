FT  28 SEP 94 / Three parties in Danish coalition


   By HILARY BARNES


   COPENHAGEN


Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen yesterday presented a new three-party minority
coalition government of his own Social Democratic party, the Centre
Democrats and the Radical Liberals to Queen Margrethe following last week's
election to Denmarks' Folketing. The main posts in the new 20-member cabinet
are unchanged, with Mr Niels Helveg Petersen, Radical, continuing as foreign
minister, Mr Mogens Lykketoft, SDP, as finance minister, and Mrs Mimi
Jakobsen, Centre Democrat, as minister for industry. Mr Nyrup Rasmussen also
named Ms Ritt Bjerregaard, a Social Democrat and former welfare minister, as
Denmark's next EU commissioner in succession to Mr Henning Christophersen,
who has held the post since 1984.
The government, which controls only 76 of 179 seats in the Folketing, will
depend on the support of the left-wing Socialist People's party and the more
extreme leftist Unity List in a parliamentary crunch. But in a 16-page
policy document the coalition calls for co-operation from both sides of the
Folketing, promising a tough fiscal policy to reduce the budget deficit.
Among the few specific proposals in the policy document, the coalition says
it will require environmental audits from all industrial companies, will
prepare 'green' national accounts, and will give wide powers to co-ordinate
government policy to the Environment Department.
