FT  23 JUL 94 / International Company News: Eramet completes 15% share
placement


   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent


The first step in the partial privatisation of French group Eramet, the
world's biggest producer of ferro-nickel and high-speed steels, has been
completed with the placing of 15 per cent with European investors, at FFr250
a share. This values Eramet at FFr3.7bn (Dollars 690.3m).
No new money was raised by Eramet, because the shares came from its three
French shareholders: ERAP, the state holding company; Elf Aquitaine, the oil
and gas group; and IMetal, the Paris-based industrial holding company.
Mr Rambaud said Eramet still wanted to offer at least another 10 per cent of
its shares, and to obtain a listing on the Paris bourse before the end of
this year.
Shares would again be provided by the three big shareholders. ERAP has
indicated, however, that it intends to retain majority control.
