FT  15 JUN 93 / International Company News: Marriott in Dollars 32m charge


   By NIKKI TAIT


   NEW YORK


MARRIOTT Corporation, the US hotels and food services group, is to take a
Dollars 32m charge against its second-quarter earnings, to reflect more
accurately the net realisable value of assets being 'held for sale'.
Marriott said the after-tax, non-cash charge followed discussions with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. As a result of the talks, Marriott will
now determine the net realisable value of all assets held for sale on a
property-by-property basis.
It had previously calculated the figure using a property-by-property
analysis for its full-service hotels, but an aggregate basis - by hotel
brand - for its other middle and economy-market hotel properties.
Marriott has also called its annual meeting for July 23, when it will ask
shareholders to vote on its controversial 'de-merger' plan. Marriott wants
to spin off its hotel management business, leaving the property assets and
the bulk of the group's heavy debts in the ongoing company.
This has angered bondholders, and some have taken legal action.
