FT  27 JUN 92 / Letter: Special education needs denied


   From Mr STEPHEN WHITE


Sir, I would like to thank your paper for its clear exposition of the future
of school education (leading article, June 25). In all the rhetoric about
opting-out leading to more parental choice, the position of children with
special educational needs has been ignored. The clear consequence is that
SEN children will have no place within these schools, which is at odds with
the principle enshrined within the 1981 Education Act that, wherever
possible, such children should have their needs met within mainstream
schools.
Parents of these children will have no choice and as the estimate of need is
20 per cent of the school population the government is likely to end up with
a growing band of deeply disgruntled parents. The education secretary needs
to think again, and quickly.
