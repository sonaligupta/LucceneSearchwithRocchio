FT  17 JAN 92 / Observer: Well telegraphed


It was scarcely a surprise punch-line that the New York Times's 65-year-old
chairman and publisher delivered yesterday. Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, known
familiarly as Punch (his sister is called Judy) named his son Arthur Ochs
Sulzberger Jr to take over as publisher.
Junior, dubbed Pinch by outsiders, joined the NY Times in 1978. Now 40, he
has worked there as general reporter, advertising man, corporate planner,
and deputy publisher.
There was never any doubt about his destiny. His earnings, which in 1990
totalled Dollars 302,500, reflected his exalted position. As one Wall Street
analyst noted a while back: 'Obviously your name isn't Sulzberger for
nothing.'
True, Pinch will have to contend with a recession-hit media market. The New
York Times Company reported a 79 per cent slump in third quarter net profit,
to Dollars 1.9m. But Sulzberger senior declared himself 'confident that
Arthur will be an excellent publisher'.
Oddly enough, much the same was said last March by Katharine Graham, owner
of the Washington Post, when she named her son Donald to succeed her as its
chief executive.
