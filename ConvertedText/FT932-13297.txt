FT  23 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Amber Day stake


   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE


Mr Philip Green signalled the end of his association with Amber Day, the
former chairman and chief executive selling the bulk of his 8.1 per cent
stake to what is believed to be a single institutional investor.
The 9.25m shares, representing 7.6 per cent of the issued ordinary capital,
went through as an agency cross at 83.5p. Amber Day moved ahead 6 to 85p in
total turnover of 19m.
News and electronic information group Reuters Holdings rose 25 to 1307p
after two securities houses recommended buying the stock following recent
weakness.
NatWest Securities moved the stock on to the buy list from a previous 'long
term outperform' stance, arguing that the shares had underperformed by 14
per cent so far this year. Also, Smith New Court analyst Mr Richard Dale
reiterated his buy recommendation.
Dollar weakness and continuing concern over the price of tobacco in the US
following the announcement by Philip Morris on Wednesday that first-quarter
cigarette volume was down by 1.1 per cent from a year ago hit BAT
Industries, which slid a further 11 to 869p.
RTZ shares bounced following recent weakness as copper prices recovered
slightly from a 5 1/2 -year low earlier this week. The stock moved forward
19 to 650p on healthy turnover of 4.2m shares.
Royal Bank of Scotland strengthened in heavy turnover after an agency cross
and positive comments from one broker ahead of half-year results scheduled
for May 5. Panmure Gordon forecasts profits of at least Pounds 58m.
Also, there was impetus from an agency cross of 2.5m shares, traded at 269p
a share, a premium to the market price. The underlying shares closed 8
higher at 270p on trading volume of 12m.
Royal Insurance added 11 at 329p as the chairman said that first-quarter
results would show an improvement over the same period in 1992.
Insurance broker CE Heath fell 12 to 313p after announcing that it is to sue
two rival brokers over insurance losses incurred by its Australian
underwriting subsidiary. Heath announced that the losses will badly affect
profits when the group reports full year results next month.
Interim results from Albert Fisher came in at the top end of market
expectations, although an initial surge in the shares was clouded by a
downbeat statement from the group's chairman.
Mr Stephen Walls said margins continued under pressure and the economic
recovery made no impact on the group's business. Most analysts left full
year forecasts unchanged. The shares slipped 2 to 69p in turnover of 1m.
Other food manufacturers stocks were muted, although some that had been
under pressure took the opportunity to catch up. Cadbury-Schweppes, which
had been worried by talk of an imminent cash call, rose 9 to 482p and Booker
gained the same to 380p. Associated British Foods shrugged off earlier
comment over its results to climb 3 to 484p.
Disappointing results from William Low hit the shares, off 17 at 209p.
Board changes at Alexon, one of the sector's favourite bid targets, lifted
the stock 6 to 89p.
News that Austin Reed, the upmarket clothes retailer, proposed transforming
'A' ordinary non-voting shares into voting shares, in a move to broaden its
shareholder base, sent both sets of shares surging. The ordinary stock ended
47 ahead at 235p and the 'A' 25 up at 132p.
Continued recovery talk helped stores. WH Smith 'A' rose 15 to 450p,
Storehouse 3 to 205p, Ratners 1 1/2 to 18 1/4 p, Lloyds Chemists 11 to 310p
and Dixons 6 to 218p.
Pharmaceuticals stocks were weaker as sellers appeared in the US. Glaxo's
rise slowed to a gain of only 3 at 602p, SmithKline Beecham 'A' shed 4 to
464p and Wellcome, which had been helped 11 higher by a Panmure Gordon buy
note and heavy overnight activity from one US brokerage, failed to get
sufficient support in London and closed 4 off at 760p.
Construction shares were in demand again as the recovery story continued to
inspire investors. South-east housebuilder Berkeley Group firmed 7 to 420p,
AMEC 6 to 93p, Tilbury Douglas 10 to 508p and Wilson Bowden 16 to 450p.
Building materials group Tarmac was up just a half-penny at 141 1/2 p after
Goldman Sachs was said to have downgraded its profits forecast. The US-owned
broker was also believed to have upgraded its forecast in BPB Industries,
ahead 4 at 229p.
In a firm drinks sector, Grand Metropolitan added 9 at 429p and Bass slipped
5 to 554p as Kleinwort Benson advised a switch, the broker fretting about
domestic price competition.
Turnover in aero engine maker Rolls-Royce rose to 10m and the shares gained
6 1/2 at 132 1/2 p as two brokers recommended the stock. UBS issued a buy
circular and Henderson Crosthwaite said an increase in passenger traffic
would lead to a rise in spares sales in the key summer months.
Henderson also favours British Aerospace, whose shares broke through the
300p barrier for the first time in several weeks to end 11 stronger at 309p,
their highest this year.
Demand continued for Smiths Industries, which reported figures on Wednesday
and the shares put on another 6 to 353p. In a buoyant metals sector, British
Steel finished the session 2 1/2 better at 93 3/4 p with volume reaching
16m.
The release of UK car production figures showing a 19-year high boosted
several component manufacturers. These included GKN, 5 up at 462p, and Lucas
Industries, still attracting bid talk and which added 2 1/2 at 137p.
Textile group Yorklyde jumped 25 to 408p as it revealed raised full year
profits of Pounds 2.2m and an improved dividend along with an upbeat
statement.
The oil majors were weak on worries ahead of first-quarter figures in early
May.
Active trade in US airline stocks that followed better than expected results
from American Airlines boosted dealing in British Airways, which firmed 5 to
289p in volume of 2.2m.
