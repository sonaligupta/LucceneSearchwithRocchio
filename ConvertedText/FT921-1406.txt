FT  24 MAR 92 / EOC opposes Tory shake-up plan


   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff


THE EQUAL Opportunities Commission is opposing government plans to shift
responsibility for overseeing its work from the Home Office to the
Department of Employment.
The move was announced last week in the Conservative manifesto as part of a
shake-up of government departments.
The manifesto said the Department of Employment would take 'lead
responsibility for co-ordinating government policy on issues of particular
concern to women'.
The EOC, which is funded by the government, has written to Mr John Major,
the prime minister, saying it has reservations about the move and that it
wants talks about any changes. The manifesto announcement surprised the EOC,
which said there had been no consultation on the issue.
Ms Margaret Prosser, an EOC commissioner and an officer of the TGWU general
workers' union, said the proposed move to the Department of Employment would
be 'likely to make it difficult for the commission to function properly'.
The EOC needed to be in a central policy department, she said. There were
also fears that the Department of Employment could be 'seriously downgraded'
if the Conservatives won the election.
There is stronger logic in the Home Office retaining responsibility for the
EOC, according to the commission, because sex equality is an issue of
'social justice'.
The EOC also stressed that supervision by the Department of Employment would
be too narrow because the EOC covered education, health, housing, training,
consumer rights and service delivery as well as employment.
The EOC has criticised the Labour manifesto proposals for a ministry for
women, with a women's minister in the cabinet. This 'could be seen as
running counter to equality of opportunity for both sexes', the commission
commented.
