FT  17 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Bioplan shareholders approve reverse
takeover


THE PROPOSED reverse takeover of Bioplan Holdings, the private healthcare
company, by Hospital Corporation International of the US was approved by
Bioplan shareholders at an extraordinary meeting yesterday.
Bioplan pioneered the setting up of private medical facilities alongside
National Health Service hospitals, with which it had partnership agreements.
Its shares were suspended at 44p in November, giving it a market value of
Pounds 19.3m.
The suspension came less than seven months after Bioplan had raised Pounds
22.8m in a rights issue and only four months after it moved up from the USM
to the main market.
Dealings in the company's shares, under its new name, Hospital Corporation
International Group, will commence today.
Mr Bob Nellist, chairman of Bioplan, is remaining as chairman of the new
group. Mr Dennis Sokol of HCI is to become deputy chairman and group chief
executive.
Under the deal HCI shareholders will gain initial control of 45 per cent of
the enlarged group.
