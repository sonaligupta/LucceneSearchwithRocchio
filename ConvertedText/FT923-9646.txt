FT  04 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Jakarta brokers issue warning
on regulation


   By WILLIAM KEELING


   JAKARTA


A REGULATION forcing brokers to complete settlement four business days after
trading could lead to some securities houses being suspended, brokers in
Jakarta have warned.
The regulation, which came into force yesterday, was drafted by Bursa Efek
Jakarta (BEJ), the private managers of the Jakarta stock exchange. Under it,
securities houses failing to settle or report to BEJ within the four-day
period face suspension while settlement remains outstanding.
'The aim is to nip in the bud incipient skulduggery. It doesn't, however,
take into account how long settlement can take,' explained one foreign
broker. Most brokers accept some delays in payment or receiving share
certificates as inevitable.
The Jakarta stock exchange is not computerised and clearing relies upon
Jakarta's banks.
