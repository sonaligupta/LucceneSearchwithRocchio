FT  14 APR 94 / Malaysia bank probe 'not needed'


   By KIERAN COOKE


   KUALA LUMPUR


The Malaysian government says there is no need for an official investigation
into foreign exchange losses by Bank Negara, the country's central bank, as
all the facts had now been made public and those responsible for the losses
had resigned, writes Kieran Cooke in Kuala Lumpur.
Bank Negara last month disclosed that it had incurred a forex trading loss
of MDollars 5.7bn (Dollars 2.1bn) in 1993. Mr Jaffar Hussein, Bank Negara's
governor, and Mr Mohamed Yakcop, believed to have been mainly responsible
for forex operations at the bank, then resigned. In 1992 Bank Negara was
forced to disclose forex losses of more than MDollars 9bn.
Mr Anwar Ibrahim, finance minister, told parliament that while Bank Negara
had made mistakes in its forex dealing, international market conditions had
been very unstable, particularly in 1992. Mr Anwar said Bank Negara's
financial position remained strong, with accumulated foreign exchange
reserves of more than MDollars 90bn.
'Errors were committed and this entailed huge losses,' said Mr Anwar. 'There
was neither any fraudulent practice nor were there any individuals
benefiting from the losses incurred.'
