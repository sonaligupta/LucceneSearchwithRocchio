FT  26 OCT 92 / Observer: Just in case


Should the British public's resistance to being submerged within Europe ever
be reversed by the fear of being firmly excluded, a suitable model for the
climbdown letter to the EC already exists. In 1157, King Henry II wrote to
Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa:
'Our kingdom and whatever anywhere is subject to our rule we place at your
disposal and commit to your power, that everything may be arranged at your
nod, and that the will of your empire may be carried out in all respects.
Let there be between us and our peoples an undivided unity of love and peace
and safety of commerce, in such a way that you, who are pre-eminent in
dignity, be given the authority of command, and to us the will to obey shall
not be lacking.'
