FT  03 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Bowater ahead of City forecasts with Pounds
103m - Shares shed 21p on warning of weaker demand


   By NEIL BUCKLEY


BOWATER last night saw its shares close down 21p at 494p after the
packaging, printing and coated products group warned that it had seen some
softening of demand in the last two months.
The fall came in spite of a 64 per cent jump in pre-tax profits from Pounds
62.4m to Pounds 102.6m for the six months to June 30. Even stripping out an
exceptional gain of Pounds 7.9m on business disposals, the profit of Pounds
94.7m was 52 per cent ahead and well above analysts' forecasts of Pounds 85m
to Pounds 90m.
But the shares came under heavy pressure, and were down 26p at one point,
after Mr Michael Woodhouse, chairman, said demand had softened in some of
Bowater's markets since the end of June.
'This calls for short-term caution,' he warned. 'Confidence remains
fragile.'
Mr David Lyon, chief executive, said fears about President Clinton's tax
plans had caused some weakening of the US market, and orders had slackened
as customers reduced their stocks. In the UK, forward demand had also
slackened in spite of last week's report from the Confederation of British
Industry that the recovery was gathering pace.
'We are still confident that we are coming out of recession, but it is very
fragile,' Mr Lyon said. 'It is not right for us to be very bland and shelter
behind what the CBI said last week.'
Analysts said the stock market reaction to Bowater's statement was
excessive. One suggested the market was 'looking for any excuse to slap
companies.'
'When Bowater can increase underlying profits, excluding acquisitions and
disposals, by 11 per cent even in bad times, that must bode very well for
the future,' he said.
Turnover from continuing operations increased by 48 per cent, from Pounds
689m to Pounds 1.02bn.
That included a Pounds 119m contribution from new acquisitions, including
Speciality Coatings International, acquired in March for Dollars 434m
(Pounds 287m), Tower Packaging, acquired in May for Dollars 105m, and the
remaining 44 per cent shareholding in MiTek, acquired in January for Dollars
55m.
While ongoing businesses increased operating profits by 11 per cent, the
acquisitions made Pounds 13.1m, and there was a further gain of Pounds 4m
from foreign exchange movements.
Group operating margins increased from 8.7 per cent to 8.8 per cent, with
the margin in the new acquisitions a better-than-expected 11 per cent.
The interim dividend is lifted 13 per cent to 5.3p. Earnings increased to
12.3p (11p).
Gearing fell from 56 per cent to 48 per cent.
Mr Lyon said the group was unlikely to make any further large-scale
acquisitions as it was concentrating on integrating and developing the most
recent ones.
