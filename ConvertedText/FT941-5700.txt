FT  04 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets: Mexico loses initial rise as
profit-taking sets in


Mexico
Mexican stocks failed to hold on to an early rise that lifted the IPC index
near to 2,600 and finished marginally down on balance on profit-taking.
The IPC index of 36 leading shares was finally 0.75 of a point off at
2,561.93, after having waffled between 2,555.04 and 2,592.13 during the day
 -on Wednesday the index ended 48.53, or nearly 2 per cent, up at 2,562.68,
but after a low for the session of 2,470.56.
Equities initially followed on from Wednesday's gains, which had been helped
by news of a tentative agreement between rebels and government mediators in
the state of Chiapas to end a two-month rebellion.
Some brokers also noted a good early performance by Telmex and the return of
foreign investors. But Telmex later fell: the ADRs were down Dollars  5/8 at
Dollars 66 5/8 shortly before the close in New York, while the 'L' shares
trading locally lost a net 0.56 per cent and the 'A' series was unchanged on
the day.
Traders attributed the early advance in Telmex to news that Smith Barney
Shearson, the US brokerage house, had raised its 1994 and 1995 earnings
estimates.
Smith Barney said that it had lifted its 1994 ADR earnings estimate to
Dollars 6.75 from Dollars 6.50 and increased its 1995 forecast to Dollars
7.80 from Dollars 7.50.
Brazil
Sao Paulo opened in a confident mood after the government clarified its
position on foreign investments by saying that it did not intend imposing
new limits. But shares eased from the day's highs to close up 2.4 per cent
in lacklustre trade after investors took to the sidelines, awaiting clear
indications on how Brazil's economy will perform in the near term.
The Bovespa index of the 54 most active shares ended at 10,458, up 243
points from the previous close.
Mr Gustavo Franco, director of international operations at the central bank,
said on Wednesday that the government would not restrict foreign investment
in the country's stock exchanges.
State-run telecom firm Telebras rose 3.1 per cent.
