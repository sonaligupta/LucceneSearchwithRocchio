FT  13 NOV 92 / Dutch approve Maastricht


   By REUTER


   THE HAGUE


The lower house of the Dutch parliament voted by a large majority last night
to ratify the Maastricht treaty on European political and monetary union,
Reuter reports from The Hague.
The Christian Democrats and the Labour party, partners in the governing
centre-left coalition, had said in advance that they would support the
treaty, as did the main opposition party, the Liberals. The treaty must
still be approved by the upper house of the Dutch parliament, where it is
also expected to win a big majority.
