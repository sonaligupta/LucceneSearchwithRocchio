FT  23 JUL 94 / UK Company News: UK Safety shares fall on warning


   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY


A profits warning from UK Safety Group, the Bristol-based specialist shoe
maker, knocked 14p off the share price yesterday which closed at 51p.
Mr John Newman, finance director, said full-year results would fall short of
market expectations.
Operating margins were under pressure in a highly competitive market and the
price of leather had also been rising steadily.
The volume of Ministry of Defence sales, which make up 16 per cent of
turnover, were down although despatch levels to the MoD in the second half
were closer to plan.
But, he said, the company's manufacturing and selling organisations had been
res-tructured to cut operating costs.
UK Safety came to the market in May last year through the reverse takeover
of TSW, the former independent television contractor for the south-west of
England.
In March it reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.6m for the year to
end-December.
The results included the trading activities of the Bristol company for the
eight months following the reverse take-over.
The company is due to report interim results in early September.
