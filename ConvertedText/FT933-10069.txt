FT  06 AUG 93 / World Trade News: UK exports 'lose out' in Argentina


   By JOHN BARHAM


BRITISH exporters to Argentina complain that the prohibitive cost of
recently extended government export insurance is losing them business in one
of Latin America's fastest growing markets, writes John Barham.
The UK government's Export Credits Guarantee Department resumed coverage to
Argentina in June, after an 11-year absence following the 1982 Falklands
war.
However, exporters see it as no more than an empty political gesture. No
company has taken out the Pounds 100m-worth of cover available for Argentina
because of its cost. Exporters must pay a 14 per cent premium (almost three
times the premium charged by other countries' export credit agencies) plus a
further 8 per cent annual interest rate.
Mr Daniel Corallo, president of Capime, a local company representing UK
power engineering company John Brown Engineering, says British goods are
well-priced, but lose to competitors backed by state-subsidised export
finance.
Mr Carlyle David of the ECGD says its computerised system enables it to
'assess risk objectively and set premiums and cover appropriate to those
risks.' Argentina has a 'fairly high risk, so we regard the amount of cover
allocated as sufficient'.
British exports to Argentina rose 51 per cent in the first five months of
this year.
