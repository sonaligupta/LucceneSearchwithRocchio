FT  01 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Beverley drops into red at Pounds 2.6m


   By RICHARD GOURLAY


BEVERLEY GROUP, which as Petrocon failed to acquire rival engineering group
James Wilkes through a hostile takeover in April, reported a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 2.57m for 1991, a year beset by operational problems and the
recession.
The loss followed profits of Pounds 941,000 last year and was struck on
sales up from Pounds 13.8m to Pounds 18.3m.
Mr Colin Robinson, chairman, said the group would continue to pursue growth
through selective acquisitions, the first stage of which was achieved in
March through the purchase of Beverley Group.
Mr Robinson and three other Petrocon directors controlled Beverley, which
Petrocon bought for Pounds 2.68m.
Beverley's results coincided with a suspension of trading in the shares of
West Industries, the engineering company where Mr Robinson was chairman
until earlier this year. The shares were suspended yesterday at 2p at the
company's request pending clarification of its financial position.
The company has posted proposals to shareholders and creditors for it to
enter into a corporate voluntary arrangement (CVA) under the 1986 Insolvency
Act and for the CVA to be supervised by Mr Cedric Clapp of Ernst & Young.
Meetings of shareholders and creditors will be held on July 14 to consider
the proposals. If approved further proposals will be put to shareholders as
soon as possible for a reconstruction of West through a scheme of
arrangement under section 425 of the 1985 Companies Act.
For the year to March 31 1991 West's pre-tax loss deepened to Pounds 6.3m
(Pounds 1.08m).
