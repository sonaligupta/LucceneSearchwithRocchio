FT  12 NOV 92 / UK Company News: AJ Archer forecasts decline to Pounds 0.9m


AJ Archer Holdings, the listed Lloyd's agency, yesterday estimated that
pre-tax profits for the year to September 30 would be not less than Pounds
900,000.
Despite the downturn from the previous year's Pounds 3.12m, the agency, the
second biggest after Sturge Holdings, plans to pay a final dividend of 2.2p,
maintaining the total at 4.4p.
Archer also announced the terms of its acquisition of fellow agency, Kellett
(Holdings). The initial Pounds 1.25m will be satisfied by Pounds 30,000 in
cash plus 2.25m shares. Additional sums due are based on share of profit
commissions on the Kellett syndicates.
