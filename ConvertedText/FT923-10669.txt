FT  29 JUL 92 / Tourist board failure 'a one-off'


THE COLLAPSE of the Thames and Chilterns Tourist Board was blamed yesterday
on special circumstances and was not expected to be repeated among the other
11 regional boards.
The English Tourist Board said it regarded the appointment of liquidators at
Thames and Chilterns as a one-off event caused by a combination of
circumstances that were not relevant elsewhere. It added: 'All the boards
have their accounts audited regularly and there have been no murmurs of
trouble anywhere else.'
Mr Michael O'Dwyer, the Thames board chairman, said factors leading to the
collapse included a 'substantial' write-down of assets, including the
board's headquarters building in Witney, Oxfordshire, the writing off of
Pounds 40,000 in bad debts, the loss of an expensive legal case, and
overspending.
A financial inquiry by the English board, which oversees the regional boards
found a deficiency of Pounds 111,000.
