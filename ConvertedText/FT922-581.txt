FT  26 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Action on drinks competition


   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE


FURTHER moves to increase competition in the Pounds 1.3bn carbonated-drinks
market were announced yesterday.
Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, asked Sir Bryan Carsberg,
director-general of fair trading, to secure undertakings from Coca-Cola &
Schweppes Beverages (CCSB) and Britvic, the industry leaders, to end
restrictive or exclusive supply agreements with pubs and other leisure
outlets.
The action follows consultations between the Department of Trade and
Industry and the companies after a Monopolies and Mergers Commission
investigation last year.
The commission found competition was generally effective in the take-home
trade but that CCSB and Britvic practices in the leisure trade could
restrict choice and lead to higher prices.
CCSB was ordered last August to seek government permission for any further
acquisitions of companies involved in the supply of draught soft drinks.
The Coca-Cola/Cadbury Schweppes joint venture has since ended distribution
agreements which the commission found to operate against the public
interest. It will now be asked to undertake not to reintroduce them.
Sir Bryan will also seek undertakings from CCSB, Britvic - which is owned by
Bass, Allied-Lyons, Whitbread and Pepsico - and Coca-Cola Bottlers (Ulster)
to end, and not reintroduce, exclusive supply agreements in the leisure
trade.
Mr Hamilton said that while leisure trade customers with such agreements
could, in certain circumstances, stock competing products, 'the effect of
exclusivity is to limit opportunities for competing suppliers and the
choices available to final consumers'.
CCSB and Britvic said yesterday such undertakings would not adversely affect
their businesses.
