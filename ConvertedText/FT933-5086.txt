FT  06 SEP 93 / Missing the unemployment-deregulation link


   By EDWARD BALLS


THE DEBATE about how to tackle high unemployment has taken a peculiar turn
in recent months. The British government, with the help of the European
Commission, has appeared able to characterise persistent unemployment as a
peculiarly continental European problem; a product of sclerotic and
over-regulated labour markets. The US and the UK are thus absolved from
continuing blame. Yes, unemployment in these countries was higher in the
1980s than in previous decades. But by embracing an agenda of labour market
deregulation, or 'flexibility', they claim to have found the solution.
This is certainly the approach that the UK plans to take both in Europe and
in the run-up to President Bill Clinton's autumn unemployment summit. Its
recent submission to the EC's review on competitiveness in Europe stated:
'There has been an upward trend in EC unemployment from cycle to cycle since
the late 1960s and an increasing proportion of long-term unemployed people.
This is evidence of inflexibility in, and over-regulation of, labour
markets. These factors deter employers from taking on new employees and
damage job creation.'
But the reality of the Anglo-Saxon labour market performance in the 1980s is
different from this rhetoric. First, while the record of the US economy in
terms of creating jobs has been superior to that of continental Europe, the
UK's record has been less impressive. Over the period 1982-90, UK employment
grew by an average 1.5 per cent a year, ahead of 0.9 per cent in the EC as a
whole, although behind the US rate of 2.1 per cent a year.
But Britain's peculiarly turbulent recent history has destroyed the
employment gains that deregulation might have delivered, as the charts show.
Both the US and French economies have steadily been adding new jobs since
1978, although at a much slower pace in France. The UK, by contrast, has
experienced an employment rollercoaster: between 1979 and 1983, employment
fell by 1.4m; the Lawson boom then replaced these lost jobs and added a net
1.9m more; but since 1990, the subsequent recession has removed the bulk of
the gains, leaving a net addition since 1978 of less than 500,000: 200,000
fewer than France. Over the period 1979-92, US employment grew by 19 per
cent, French employment by 3 per cent and UK employment by 0.4 per cent.
More important, this employment growth has co-existed with persistently
lower male employment in both Anglo-Saxon countries. On average over the
period 1982-90, and thus excluding the effects of either British recession,
9.7 per cent of British workers were unemployed according to the OECD,
higher than in both the US and France. But rising unemployment is only part
of the story. Male labour force participation in the US and UK has dropped
sharply over the past two decades as many have shifted from being
'unemployed' to 'economically inactive'. The common characteristic of these
two groups is that they do not have jobs; all can be classified as
'non-employed'. On average in the 1980s, 12 per cent of US males aged 25-54,
and 14.9 per cent of UK prime-age males were out of work compared to only
9.1 per cent in France.
The Anglo-Saxon economies have achieved one notable success: by encouraging
the creation of relatively low-wage service sector jobs which the male
non-employed have shunned, they have delivered many more employment
opportunities for women who want to enter the labour market. Over the period
1983-90, female employment in Britain grew by 22 per cent compared to 8 per
cent in France. The proportion of women of working age who have jobs rose to
nearly 60 per cent in both Britain and the US on average in the 1980s,
compared with less than 50 per cent in France and Germany.
But neither the US nor the UK experience suggests that a deregulated, more
'flexible', labour market means lower male non-employment. So the British
government's willingness to sing the praises of Anglo-Saxon style labour
market deregulation seems misplaced.

       INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC INDICATORS: PRODUCTION AND EMPLOYMENT
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Yearly data for retail sales volume and industrial production plus all
data for the vacancy rate indicator are in index form with 1985=100.
Quarterly and monthly data for retail sales and industrial production
show the percentage change over the corresponding period in the
previous year, and are positive unless otherwise stated. The
unemployment rate is shown as a percentage of the total labour force.
Figures for the composite leading indicator are end-period values.
