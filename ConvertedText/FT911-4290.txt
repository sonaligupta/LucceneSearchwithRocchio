FT  19 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: Bell Group bondholders at
risk


   By MARK WESTHILL

EUROPEAN bond holders owed USDollars 587m are at risk following the
appointment of a provisional liquidator at Bell Group, a subsidiary of Bond
Corporation.
The liquidator was appointed yesterday after the breakdown of talks with Mr
Kerry Packer over a proposed restructuring of Bell.
Mr Packer's Australian Consolidated Press had sought to inject ADollars 60m
of fresh capital into Bell in exchange for taking 15.1 per cent of the
company, but negotiations between the two sides broke down. Mr Packer was
seeking control of Bell's main asset, the West Australian newspaper.
Bell also has 39 per cent of Bell Resources (since renamed Australian
Consolidated Investments) an investment worth around ADollars 43m.
The directors of Bell group decided to seek a provisional liquidator when
they realised the company could not meet a demand for the redemption of
ADollars 150m in convertible bonds held by the West Australian state
government insurance commission (WASGIC). Bell defaulted on interest
payments on the bond last September, triggering an SGIC demand for full
repayment. Bell directors told their main bankers, owed ADollars 330m, that
they could not meet the repayments. The banks reportedly pressed Bell to
seek a formal manager.
Bell Group has ADollars 587m of convertible bonds outstanding, mostly held
by UK and European investors. The two series of bonds with coupon rates of
10 per cent and 11 per cent, mature in 1995 and 1992.
