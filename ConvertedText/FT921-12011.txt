FT  29 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Saville Gordon returns to the black


   By JANE FULLER


J SAVILLE Gordon Group, the property, pipeline and securities trading
concern, staged a recovery in the half year to end-October, reporting
pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.35m.
The outcome compared with losses of Pounds 2.43m last time following
writedowns in the share portfolio and a slump in property dealing.
The main turnround came in the securities trading division, which made
profits of Pounds 240,000 (losses of Pounds 3.38m). Turnover improved to
Pounds 15.3m (Pounds 3.37m).
Mr Terry Hutchinson, finance director, said the division would benefit in
the second half from BM Group's takeover of Thomas Robinson, the engineering
company in which Saville Gordon holds about 7m shares.
The first half of last year had been 'particularly unpleasant' for the
securities division. This time there had been more activity and Pounds 5m of
shares had been sold as the portfolio was run down.
This had helped to reduce debt to about Pounds 38m from its year-end level
of nearly Pounds 43m, when gearing was more than 90 per cent.
The main profit contributor was property investment at Pounds 2.75m (Pounds
2.76m). This was virtually all rental income, with dealing adding only
'peanuts', according to Mr Hutchinson.
Pipeline equipment and stockholding, reflecting the group's roots in scrap
metal and merchanting, was bogged down in the UK recession and saw profits
fall to Pounds 636,000 (Pounds 956,000) on reduced turnover of Pounds 10.2m
(Pounds 12.2m).
Earnings per share amounted to 0.9p (losses of 1.54p). The interim dividend
is maintained at 0.5p.
