FT  28 MAR 92 / International Company News: Belgian retailers improve in
1991

   BRUSSELS


BELGIUM'S two largest retail groups - Delhaize 'Le Lion' and GIB Group  -
both pushed up profits in 1991, justifying the strong support for their
shares on the Brussels market this year.
Delhaize, largest of Belgium's three quoted retailers, announced that net
consolidated profits had risen nearly 16 per cent in 1991 to BFr4.37bn
(Dollars 127.7m), from BFr3.77bn in the previous year.
The company is proposing a 21 per cent increase in the dividend from BFr72
to BFr87 a share, and the directors are also planning a one-off dividend of
BFr33 a share to celebrate the company's 125th anniversary.
Turnover at Delhaize, which operates the expanding Food Lion chain of
supermarkets in the US, rose more than 16 per cent to BFr310bn, from
BFr266bn.
Food Lion itself pushed up sales by 15 per cent and opened a further 103
stores during the year, bringing the total number of US supermarkets to 881
across 12 states.
Meanwhile, GIB indicated it would show an increase in consolidated profit
from BFr2.99bn to BFr3.35bn for the 12 months to January 31, 1992.
Turnover rose to BFr217bn, from BFr205bn the previous year, although in the
dominant supermarket sector, sales crept up by only 1.5 per cent. Detailed
1991 accounts for the group - which is also active in the do-it-yourself and
fast food sectors - will be drawn up by the directors during May.
The group said it would devote BFr6.4bn to modernising its operations in all
sectors during 1992 - a 30 per cent increase on the 1991 investment plan.
