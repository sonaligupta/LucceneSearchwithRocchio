FT  12 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: WPP Group


Any company launching a heavily-dilutive rights issue chiefly to repay a
bridging loan could reasonably expect a roasting from shareholders. Yet such
is the topsy-turvy state of advertising companies that WPP's Pounds 88m cash
call was greeted by a 17 per cent rise in its share price.
A fund-raising exercise was forecast when WPP last restructured itself. Its
announcement therefore came as a relief. The issue is fully underwritten -
even though Samuel Montagu will back 20 per cent of the sub-underwriting -
further reinforcing confidence.
The temptation is to view WPP as a cheap recovery stock. WPP's results
suggest it is trading reasonably well - at least in comparison with Saatchi
& Saatchi. The upturn in the US will help. Nevertheless, WPP will still have
negative shareholders' funds of Pounds 157m after the rights issue. More
worryingly, it will experience a further cash outflow this year after
earn-out payments. Another downward lurch in advertising would prove
severely embarrassing. Still, no one pretends WPP's shares are for anyone
but grown-ups.
