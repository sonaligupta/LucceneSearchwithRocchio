FT  12 APR 94 / International Company News: Ferfin rights issue could give
banks 69% stake


   By REUTER


   ROME


Creditor banks of Italy's troubled industrial group, Ferruzzi Finanziaria
(Ferfin), could control 68.9 per cent of the food-to-chemicals company if
they fully take up a complex L1,339bn (Dollars 825m) rights issue announced
yesterday, Reuter reports from Rome.
Ferfin said the stake could end up being owned by the approximately 50 banks
that make up the consortium guaranteeing the complex four-tranche issue. At
present, the banks own some 48.7 per cent of Ferfin.
Serafino Ferruzzi, the family holding company that sits above Ferfin and
once controlled what was Italy's second-largest private business, will see
its stake fall to 12.0 per cent from 19.8 per cent. It has waived its rights
to the new shares.
The capital increase, approved by shareholders last November, involves four
separate operations calling for the issue of a total of 580m shares at
prices ranging from L1,000 to L4,000.
Proceeds will be used to cut Ferfin debts by L706.2bn and those of its
Gruppo Alca (Trading) unit by L633bn.
The first tranche involves the issue of 353m shares on a 10-for-21 basis, at
a price of L2,000. Banks can subscribe for shares up to a limit of 55 per
cent of their exposure. The remaining 45 per cent will be restructured.
Ferruzzi will also offer some 59.62m shares priced at L5,000 on a 10-for-83
basis before December 1998; some 79.56m shares priced at L2,000 each on a
10-for-21 basis in an operation to raise L159.1bn; and 87.87m shares at
L2,000 generating L175.8bn.
