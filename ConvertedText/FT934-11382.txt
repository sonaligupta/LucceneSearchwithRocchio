FT  01 NOV 93 / Observer: Gas bags


It was, by all accounts, a very auspicious meeting, when Cedric Brown, chief
executive of British Gas, first sat down with his new regulator, Clare
Spottiswoode.
Spottiswoode, who takes over from Sir James McKinnon today, invited herself
round a few days ago for an hour's introductory chat. The pair hit it off so
well that she stayed for two and a half.
'It was very constructive and wide-ranging,' beams Brown. 'We talked about
issues spanning the whole breadth of the business in a way which we'd never
done before. It bodes well.'
Which marks something of a departure from the stormy encounters that
characterised British Gas's relationship with Sir James in the bad old days.
Even McKinnon has mellowed a touch. At his farewell party last week, he
spoke almost fondly of the people 'in that building down by the river' - not
that he could bring himself to mouth the name of the company inhabiting the
Thamesside headquarters.
