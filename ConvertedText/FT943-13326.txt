FT  20 JUL 94 / Observer: Ministering to the nation


Prime minister John Major's passion for furthering public-sector cost
controls is all very well; but just how far is he prepared to go?
A senior Whitehall mandarin has now worked out that each minister costs the
UK taxpayer a basic Pounds 250,000 a year. That includes only his or her
salary, office and transport costs. Add in the team of civil service
high-flyers demanded even by the most junior ministers, and the bill quickly
rises to more than Pounds 500,000.
So the advice to Major who, like his predecessor, prefers increasing to
cutting the ministerial payroll, is: thrift, like charity, should begin at
home.
Perhaps he will put his mouth where the money is this week - by not just
reshuffling the 100-plus cabinet, non-cabinet and junior ministerial ranks,
but by trimming their ranks a trifle.
