FT  19 APR 91 / Sharp fall in US trade deficit for February


   By MICHAEL PROWSE


   WASHINGTON


THE US trade deficit fell sharply in February to a seasonally adjusted
Dollars 5.3bn (Pounds 2.96bn), the lowest since September 1983, the Commerce
Department reported yesterday. The fall was due to a cut in the bill for oil
imports coupled with the effects of domestic recession.
February's figure compares with Dollars 7.2bn in January and a monthly
average of Dollars 8.4bn in 1990.
If the improvement is sustained, the trade figures for 1991 are likely to
show a marked improvement on recent years. The merchandise trade deficit has
exceeded Dollars 100bn every year since 1984.
A separate report showed a sharp drop in weekly claims for unemployment
insurance. This was interpreted by financial markets as a sign that the rate
of decline of employment is beginning to bottom out. Bond prices fell
sharply yesterday as traders postponed hopes of further cuts in interest
rates.
Mr Robert Mosbacher, commerce secretary, said the lower trade deficit
reflected a long-term trend toward improved export performance. Exports fell
2 1/2 per cent between January and February to Dollars 33.5bn, but remained
6 per cent higher than in the same period last year.
Exports remain a source of relative buoyancy for the US economy but their
rate of growth has fallen steadily in the past two years as demand overseas
has eased.
The fall in February's trade deficit was mainly caused by a 6 1/2 per cent
decline in imports from January to Dollars 38.8bn, roughly the same level as
a year ago. Two thirds of it reflected a Dollars 1.1bn drop in the crude oil
import bill to Dollars 2.8bn.
Oil imports were lower partly because of a recession-induced fall in demand
for petroleum and partly because the average price paid per barrel fell by
Dollars 4.40 to just over Dollars 18.
The non-petroleum trade deficit - a guide to the underlying trade balance -
is continuing to improve. It fell to Dollars 2.5bn, compared with Dollars
2.8bn in January and a monthly average of Dollars 3.9bn last year.
Initial claims for state unemployment insurance fell 22,000 to a seasonally
adjusted 451,000 in the week to April 6. This followed a 70,000 decline the
previous week which some analysts had attributed to distortions caused by
the timing of Easter.
If the trend is sustained, economists are likely to revise down forecasts of
further drops in employment. The Federal Reserve will also be less inclined
to cut interest rates.
