FT  06 NOV 93 / Bonn minister accused of arousing mass hysteria

GERMANY'S health minister, Mr Horst Seehofer, was yesterday facing angry
criticism from doctors and health agencies for allegedly unleashing 'mass
hysteria' among former and future patients over the danger of HIV-infected
blood products.
In the face of a sharp drop in donors giving blood to collection agencies,
Prince Botho zu Sayn-Wittgenstein, president of the German Red Cross,
appealed for the whole debate to be 'de-emotionalised'.
'The current Aids debate has led to great insecurity among millions of
fellow citizens,' he said. 'Countless patients are refusing essential blood
transfusions, for fear of a possible Aids-infection. Many donors are asking
anxiously what is happening to their blood.'
The Red Cross confirmed that there had been a 10 per cent drop in blood
donors in the state of Baden-Wurttemberg and a 5 per cent decrease in North
Rhine-Westphalia, perhaps out of fear of giving blood alongside Aids
sufferers.
In Koblenz, the local authority said yesterday that 88 hospitals and blood
distributors, including one company in Austria and one in Switzerland, had
been contacted since October 27 to warn them about possible receipt of
HIV-infected blood from the UB Plasma laboratory in the town.
Any plasma from the laboratory in the affected hospitals had been seized by
the police, the authorities said. Four members of the company, including the
chief executive, have been arrested and face charges of negligence in
failing to ensure adequate HIV-testing of blood products.
Evidence of inadequate testing at the laboratory, and suspicion that others
could also be involved, has precipitated a national panic over blood
products. A suggestion by Mr Seehofer on Wednesday that any former patient
who had received blood in recent years should have be tested for HIV has
caused pandemonium on hospital switchboards.
The Marburger Bund, a federation representing some 57,000 hospital doctors,
accused Mr Seehofer of acting 'over-hastily' and without any scientific
basis.
In Berlin, Dr Ellis Huber, the chairman of the city medical council,
denounced what he called a 'federal mass hysteria about Aids' which had been
unleashed, he said, by Mr Seehofer's 'false alarm'.
Professor Hans Pohle, a leading Aids specialist, announced his resignation
from the national Aids advisory council in protest. In a letter to the
minister, he said there had been no reason to arouse a mass phobia.
Mr Seehofer, who has previously enjoyed a high political reputation,
particularly for pushing through drastic savings in the health service,
angrily rejected the criticism as 'irresponsible'. 'It is better to take one
preventive measure too many, than to run the risk of a single HIV
infection,' he said.
