FT  08 NOV 94 / Solomon Islands PM elected


   By NIKKI TAIT


   SYDNEY


Mr Solomon Mamaloni was yesterday elected prime minister of the Solomon
Islands, following the resignation of Mr Francis Billy Hilly, the previous
incumbent, last week. In his swearing-in speech, Mr Mamaloni hinted the new
government would review logging policy, and warned that the Pacific nation's
economic condition was 'precarious'. Logging in the Solomons has been the
subject of international attention, with criticism levelled at some of the
foreign companies operating there. Mr Mamaloni, 1982-84 and 1989-93 prime
minister, is a popular figure in the Solomon Islands. But he can be
unpredictable and in the past has fallen out with other governments,
according to a diplomat in Honiara.
