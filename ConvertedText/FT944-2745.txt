FT  16 DEC 94 / International Company News: CAE sells military unit to GM
subsidiary


   By ROBERT GIBBENS


CAE, the world's leading aircraft flight simulator maker, has sold its Link
military division in the US to Hughes Electronics, a subsidiary of US
carmaker General Motors, for CDollars 213m (USDollars 153m).
The Canadian electronics group has been trying to sell the loss-making Link
division for some time. It represented nearly half CAE's total sales of
CDollars 1.1bn in fiscal 1994.
Link's problems, which are partly due to cuts in US defence spending, have
depressed CAE's stock price and hurt overall performance.
The price compares with CDollars 665m paid by CAE to Singer of the US, then
controlled by American financier Mr Paul Bilzerian, for Link in 1988.
This year CAE took a CDollars 396m charge for Link and announced more
rationalisation. It will take a further CDollars 30m special charge this
year.
CAE retains certain Link products in ship machinery control, oil process
control modelling, bio-medical and entertainment simulation. It has also
retained USDollars 160m of tax losses available against future US
operations.
CAE said it would now be virtually debt-free and would concentrate on
developing its simulator and electronic controls businesses worldwide.
Following the merger of Thomson-CFS and Rediffusion in Europe, only two big
players remain in aircraft simulators.
