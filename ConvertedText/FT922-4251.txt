FT  06 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls in
arbitrage related trade


   By EMIKO TERAZONO


   TOKYO


SHARE prices retreated on arbitrage related selling in thin trading
yesterday, unimpressed by the strong yen and bond prices, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average lost 1 per cent or 174.03 to 17,790.04, 3 per cent lower
on the week. The index opened at the day's high of 17,900.04 and fell to a
low of 17,724.31 in the afternoon. Volume fell to 180m shares from 215m.
Activity was limited to individuals and dealers, institutional investors
remaining inactive before the expiration of June futures contracts.
Declines overwhelmed advances by 683 to 227, with 174 unchanged. The Topix
index of all first section stocks lost 8.14 to 1,345.96 and, in London, the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 1.02 to 1,061.85.
In spite of lingering concern, most analysts expect the futures expiration
and settlements next week to be a 'non-event' due to declining arbitrage
positions. Institutional buying is also expected to absorb the unwinding.
Yesterday saw light index-linked selling, and illiquid component stocks of
the Nikkei 225 index fell sharply. Daito Woolen Spinning & Weaving fell Y24
to Y731 and Shinagawa Refractories by Y13 to Y750.
Fanuc, the machine tool equipment and robotics maker, lost Y110 to Y4,150.
Investors were discouraged by the decision by General Motors of the US to
sell its stake in a joint venture set up with Fanuc.
Trust banks were lower on concerns over bad debts. Mitsui Trust and Banking
fell to a year's low, and closed Y30 down at Y783. The company has extended
loans to several real estate and stock speculators facing financial trouble,
and is involved in restructuring programs of land developers. Mitsubishi
Trust and Banking fell Y30 to Y920 and Sumitomo Trust and Banking declined
Y19 to Y931.
Theme stocks declined as dealers took profits ahead of the weekend. Meiji
Milk Products, the most active issue of the day, fell Y3 to Y928, and Japan
Metals & Chemicals declined Y15 to Y738.
Blue chip electricals lost ground on the lack of foreign support. Sony fell
Y70 to Y4,320 and NEC declined Y18 to Y910.
In Osaka, the OSE average declined by 177.72 to 20,487.66 in volume of 10.6m
shares. Small-lot selling by individuals depressed the index.
Roundup
HONG KONG and Taiwan were closed for public holidays and in any case, said
Mr David Bates of Asia Equity, investors have been looking to lock in their
Hong Kong profits and look for gains elsewhere.
MANILA obliged, rising another 20.48 yesterday to a record closing high of
1,517.21, up 8.4 per cent on the week, partly on anticipation that the
Philippines ex-defence chief, Mr Fidel Ramos, would be proclaimed president
by Congress, which is still tabulating results of the May 11 election.
Turnover jumped from 599m pesos to 741.6m.
JAKARTA's official index rose 2.08 in half-day trading to 315.58, up 5.5 per
cent on the week. Mr Bates observed that the main reason, a percentage point
cut in the base rate, still left Indonesia's base lending rate at 27 per
cent, but that inflation was at single digit level and that more interest
rate cuts were expected to come.
Indonesia and the Philippines, said Mr Bates, were getting their economic
growth through to corporate earnings, unlike Singapore and Malaysia where
equities were been relatively quiet last week.
BANGKOK rallied after a jittery week, the SET index advancing 17.49, or 2.6
per cent to 702.24, 1.9 per cent higher on the week, in reaction to an
opposition decision to nominate Democrat Party leader Chuan Leekpai as a
compromise prime minister.
BOMBAY staged a rebound to close with the BSE index up 81.82 at 3,086.74, up
2.7 per cent on another week of scandal speculation; the week before, it
fell by 12.5 per cent.
