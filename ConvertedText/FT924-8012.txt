FT  13 NOV 92 / Observer: Nuclear affront


A particularly dirty little fight is going on in one corner of the great
battle to save the UK coal industry. The combatants are Nuclear Electric,
the state-owned utility which operates 12 nuclear stations in England and
Wales, and PowerGen, one of the two big privatised generation companies.
It started when Ed Wallis, PowerGen's hard-knuckle chief executive,
suggested that the best way to boost demand for coal-fired power was by
shutting down NE's ageing Magnox reactors.
Outraged noises emanated from NE's headquarters in Gloucester as Bob Hawley,
the newly appointed chief executive, roared into action. He fired off a
letter to Wallis, pointing out that he had got all his sums wrong. 'We
believe this is a time for a balanced and statesmanlike approach, not for
mischievous proposals and statements without a basis in fact,' he boomed.
But there was nothing very statesmanlike about NE's subsequent tactics.
Discreet notes were circulated to the press pointing out that PowerGen was
importing coal, burning the 'dirty fuel' orimulsion, and had been censured
by the electricity regulator for 'abusing' its dominant market position.
NE even dug up a 1979 note in which Wallis, then manager of Oldbury nuclear
power station, 'emphasised the future benefits of nuclear power and also the
possible consequences (eg the cost of alternatives) if nuclear power were
not developed in future years'.
