FT  17 JAN 92 / Letter: 'Open season' attack is no cure for pensions ills,
while new structure is logical answer to abuses


   From A E MILLER


Sir, I must take issue with John Plender. His whole argument hinges on the
statement that 'a pension fund exists to deliver the best possible
retirement benefits to employees or it is nothing'.
In the vast majority of cases pension funds do not exist for such purpose,
they exist to back up and support the benefit promises made to members of
the scheme by the employer.
If, by good management or plain luck, there turn out to be more funds in the
pension fund than are necessary to support the promises made, then to my
mind it is perfectly reasonable for credit for this surplus to be taken by
the employer, just as he will have to apply additional funding if the
reverse turns out to be the case.
Improvement in benefit promises is not a matter for the pension funds as
such. This is a question of terms and conditions of employment which should
be negotiated directly between the employer and the workforce through
whatever is the normal negotiating channel.
