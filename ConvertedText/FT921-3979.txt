FT  11 MAR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Sterling retreats after Budget


   By NEIL BUCKLEY


STERLING lost most of its earlier gains when the UK Budget met mixed
reactions in the market, and failed to deliver the hoped-for boost, writes
Neil Buckley.
The UK currency was the centre of attention for much of the day, although
the dollar climbed a little in late European trading on speculative buying
in a thin market.
Mr Mark Austin, economist at HongKong Bank, said sterling fell back on
market worries about chancellor Mr Norman Lamont's prediction of a Pounds
28bn public sector borrowing requirement, and disappointment that he had
made no firm commitment to moving the UK currency into the narrow 2.25 per
cent band of the Exchange Rate Mechanism. Mr Lamont said only that the move
would be made 'in due course'.
Rumours that a firm commitment would be made had taken sterling higher
against the D-Mark after a dull morning, reaching DM2.8725/50 shortly before
Mr Lamont's speech began. Afterwards, however, it dropped around half a
pfennig to DM2.8673/08, although this was still above its starting level of
DM2.8654/89. Against the top-placed peseta, it was once again at its ERM
floor.
Mr Austin added: 'The opinion polls in a few days will be the deciding
factor for sterling, but I do not think its fortunes will be much changed by
this Budget. There was a lot of fiddling around at the edges but nothing
headline-grabbing.'
The dollar, meanwhile, reached DM1.6705/15 from a DM1.6620 start, and gained
strongly on the yen to Y132.80/90 from Y132.30/40. In New York the US unit
finished at DM1.6710 and Y132.90.
Dealers said a major south-east Asian player and some New York funds had
been buying dollars.
The yen continued to be undermined by speculation that the Bank of Japan
would soon cut interest rates, possibly shortly after Mr Yasushi Mieno, bank
governor, returns from a visit to Europe today.
The US currency had crept higher against both the yen and the D-Mark in thin
Asian trading, hovering close to its Y132.20 resistance level.
Dealers said trading interest was limited ahead of the 'Super Tuesday' US
presidential primaries, although an expected victory by Mr George Bush over
challenger Mr Pat Buchanan would have little effect unless his share of the
vote was lower than 60 to 70 per cent.
In Europe, the D-Mark was little changed against most EMS currencies, but
rose against the yen to Y79.43 from Monday's Y79.34.
It was a touch firmer against the Belgian franc a day after Belgium
announced it was considering letting short-term interest rates drop below
equivalent German rates.
The D-Mark declined slightly against the Swiss franc, although dealers said
the Swiss National Bank's intervention last Friday seemed to have ended the
franc's slide for the moment.
