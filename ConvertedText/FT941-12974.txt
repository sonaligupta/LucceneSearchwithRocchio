FT  27 JAN 94 / International Company News: Mitel continues strong recovery


   By ROBERT GIBBENS


The strong recovery at Mitel, the manufacturer of PBXs, integrated circuits
and telephone equipment that was formerly controlled by British Telecom,
continued in the third quarter, writes Robert Gibbens.
Profit for the three months ended December 24 was CDollars 7.9m (USDollars
6m), or 7 cents a share, up from CDollars 1.4m, or one cent, a year earlier
on revenues of CDollars 129m, up 15 per cent. Nine-month profit was CDollars
15.9m, or 13 cents, against a loss of CDollars 9.3m, or 15 cents, on
revenues of CDollars 351m, ahead from CDollars 305m.
Strength in the December quarter came largely from higher PBX sales in the
US and rising demand for specialised circuits.
