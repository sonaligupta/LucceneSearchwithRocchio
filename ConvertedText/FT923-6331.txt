FT  25 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Ingham


Ingham, the worsted spinner, described trading in its first half as 'more
buoyant than for some considerable time'
Profits before tax for the six months to June 30 amounted to Pounds 135,000,
against Pounds 26,000 last time. Turnover was Pounds 2.98m (Pounds 2.52m).
Mr David Courtman, chairman, said that new processing equipment had proved
beneficial while wool prices at a historical low should encourage forward
orders.
Although the retail sector did not appear 'over optimistic', exports were
contributing more to turnover and further expansion overseas was being
sought, he added.
The interim dividend is raised to 1.5p (1p), payable from earnings of 3.3p
(0.8p) per share.
