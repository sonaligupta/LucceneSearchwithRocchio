FT  16 DEC 94 / People: In the pipeline at Hardy


   By ROBERT CORZINE


John Walmsley, the former finance director at Enterprise Oil, the UK's
largest independent oil explorer, has been appointed chief executive of
Hardy Oil and Gas as from January 1.
He will succeed Peter Elwes, who will become deputy chairman with a
full-time executive role. Elwes, who was Enterprise Oil's first chief
executive, interviewed Walmsley for his first job at Enterprise in 1984. The
two men say their long relationship should ensure a smooth transition.
Elwes has been head of Hardy since 1989, when the company was demerged from
Trafalgar House. He is due to retire in 1996. Walmsley was a director of
Enterprise Oil from 1984 to 1993 and departed several months before
Enterprise made its abortive bid for fellow explorer Lasmo.
His appointment at Hardy ends almost a year of industry speculation about
his future.
Walmsley says there is unlikely to be any big shift in strategy at Hardy; he
intends to follow the philosophy he developed at Enterprise of focusing on
core areas. In recent years the company has used the considerable cash
generated by its extensive North American operations to fund longer-term
projects in the UK sector of the North Sea.
