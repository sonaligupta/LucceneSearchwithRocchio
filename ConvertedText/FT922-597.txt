FT  26 JUN 92 / New move against Whitehall secrecy


THE government yesterday signalled its determination to open Whitehall up to
greater public scrutiny with the announcement that secret intelligence
papers would no longer be withheld automatically from publication under the
30-year rule.
Mr William Waldegrave, the minister in charge of the drive for more open
government, said on BBC Radio 4 that some documents relating to the
top-secret Joint Intelligence Committee could now be published.
Mr Waldegrave also announced that he would soon publish a white paper on
open government. This would include plans to sweep away more than 150
restrictions on the release of information.
