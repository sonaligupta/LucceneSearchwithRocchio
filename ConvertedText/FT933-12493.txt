FT  23 JUL 93 / International Company News: Munich Re maintains dividend as
loss widens

MUNCHENER Ruckver-sicherung (Munich Re), Europe's largest insurance group,
is to pay an unchanged annual dividend, in spite of heavier losses from
mainstream reinsurance business.
The company blamed the increase in losses on Hurricane Andrew, which hit the
south-east of the US last summer and mounting car theft.
Munich Re gave no figure but the loss is likely to be in the region of DM1bn
(Dollars 588m) after losses of more than DM900m last year.
The group said income from investments and from general insurance business
more than made up for the renewed loss and parent company profits would be
the same level as in the previous year.
This, Munich Re said, would enable the payment of a dividend of DM10 per
share - the fifth year in succession that the Munich-based group has paid
this dividend.
It voiced optimism about the future, saying that capacity in the world
reinsurance market was beginning to shrink after a number of years when the
industry was beleaguered by the double burden of excess capacity and a row
of natural disasters.
This began with Hurricane Hugo in 1989 followed by the winter storms in
1990, Typhoon Mireille in 1991 and Hurricane Andrew last summer.
Munich Re said that after this period of disastrous conditions for the
reinsurance industry there was a chance of a substantial improvement in
prices for reinsurance coverage.
There had been a noticeable improvement in prices and conditions for
reinsurance and the trend was expected to continue throughout the current
year, Munich Re said.
The company warned that at the group level, there would be a small decline
in 1992-93 earnings as investment and other income had not fully offset
mainstream underwriting losses.
Last year, group net earnings were DM177.6m, nearly 70 per cent up on the
previous year.
Group premium income for 1992-93 increased by 11 per cent to about DM25bn,
Munich Re said.
Premium income at the parent company rose to DM16bn from DM14.6bn in
1991-92.
Total group investments climbed 6 per cent to DM76bn by the end of June.
Munich Re will publish the full details of 1992-93 figures in October.
