FT  05 AUG 93 / International Company News: Collapse of peseta helps lift
Repsol 6%

REPSOL, Spain's large state-controlled oil and chemicals group, yesterday
reported a 20 per cent rise in operating profits, to Pta73.6bn (Dollars
515m), for the first half of 1993, helped by the collapse of the peseta
against the US dollar .
The group said its net profits for the first half had risen 6.3 per cent
against the same period last year, to Pta43.1bn. Cash-flow rose 13.8 per
cent, to Pta92.2bn, with most of the increase coming in the second quarter
when the peseta suffered its third devaluation in less than nine months.
Repsol said it would have done even better - despite Spain's worst recession
in more than 20 years - had it not been for a drought which forced the
closure of its Puertollanos chemicals complex for most of the six months,
labour strife at its Bilbao refinery, and the short-term effects of the
peseta devaluation, which forced up retail petrol prices.
The cost of these setbacks was around Pta7bn. The group said the weaker
peseta had helped widen those commercial margins in its refining,
exploration and chemicals businesses, which are expressed in pesetas.
Operating profits in the exploration and production division rose sharply,
from Pta10.2bn to Pta13.9bn, largely because of the dollar's strength.
Losses at the chemicals group deepened slightly to Pta4.6bn.
Repsol said, however, it had noted an improvement in the chemicals business
in the second three months, even though the Puertollanos complex had only
come back on stream in June.
