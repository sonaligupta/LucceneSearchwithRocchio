FT  28 APR 94 / International Company News: European trading holds back 3M

   NEW YORK


3M, the diversified US manufacturing group, said that economic softness in
Europe and Japan and unfavourable currency fluctuations continued to hamper
its performance in the first quarter.
Net income slipped to Dollars 306m, or 72 cents a share, from Dollars 330m,
or 75 cents, in the first three months of 1993.
If a previously-announced charge of Dollars 35m related to breast-implant
litigation were excluded, earnings would have come in at 77 cents a share.
All figures were adjusted to reflect a two-for-one stock split effective
last month.
In spite of solid gains in the US and other Asian markets, sluggish
conditions in Europe and Japan limited overall growth in sales volume to 6
per cent. That level represents a slowdown from the past few quarters, when
volume has grown by 7 per cent on average.
The volume gain translated into a meagre 3 per cent increase in revenues to
Dollars 3.62bn, as improvement was limited by the strength of the dollar and
a 2 per cent decline in prices worldwide.
The group, whose products range from recording tape and arts supplies to
industrial adhesives and sealants, said that its performance in the US was
encouraging, as it outpaced the rate of economic growth.
Operating income in the home market climbed 13 per cent, offsetting a slight
decline overseas.
The results were in line with the expectations of Wall Street.
In spite of the lacklustre first quarter, Mr LD DeSimone, chairman and chief
executive, said the company saw no reason to revise its forecast that 1994
earnings would exceed last year's Dollars 2.91 a share.
