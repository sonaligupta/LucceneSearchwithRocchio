FT  09 JAN 92 / EC 'ice-cream' men play crucial role


   By JUDY DEMPSEY


CALLED the ice-cream men by their supporters, but lackeys of Germany by
their opponents, the white-uniformed EC observers have played a crucial role
in trying to monitor 15 ceasefires since arriving in Croatia last August,
writes Judy Dempsey.
The 170 unarmed monitors have worked indefatigably from their headquarters
in Hotel 'I' in Zagreb.
Their task initially was to supervise the implementation of ceasefires
forged by the EC with the federal army, Croatia's national guard, and Serb
and Croat paramilitary units. But, since September, they have been involved
in setting up negotiations to secure the peaceful withdrawal of soldiers
from federal army garrisons in Croatia. Above all, they have attempted to
set up confidence-building measures.
