FT  13 APR 94 / Observer: Heavy turnover


Jim Maxmin's sudden exit from Laura Ashley is bad news for Americans serving
in the top management of Britain's clothing stores.
They may be brilliant retailers but they are getting to be a flighty bunch.
David Dworkin did just eight months as Storehouse's chief executive before
being tempted away by an offer he couldn't refuse.
Now Maxmin is quitting, following a disagreement over investment, after only
2 1/2 years on the job. That leaves Burton's John Hoerner, who has just
celebrated his second anniversary as Burton's ceo. Hang on in there, John.
