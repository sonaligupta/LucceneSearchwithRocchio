FT  15 APR 94 / Major in clash on NHS claims


   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent


Mr John Major yesterday rejected reports that people over the age of 65 were
being denied treatment by the National Health Service.
The prime minister was involved in a heated clash with Mrs Margaret Beckett,
deputy Labour leader, at prime ministers' question time.
Mrs Beckett said the government was responsible for denying treatment on the
grounds of age. Mr Major accused her of 'peddling an untruth' in a
politically motivated scaremongering campaign.
Mr Major rephrased the charge at the direction of Miss Betty Boothroyd, the
speaker - but refused Labour demands that he should withdraw it and
apologise to Mrs Beckett for accusing her of lying.
The prime minister insisted: 'No one is denied proper treatment at any stage
in the National Health Service.'
He rebuked the BBC for being 'wholly irresponsible' in highlighting a claim
by a 73-year-old Brighton man that his treatment for chronic arthritis had
been stopped because of his age. Mr Major said two patients referred to had
simply been offered better options.
Mrs Beckett denied misleading the House. She said one of the patients
referred to had received a letter of apology from the hospital: 'That does
not sound to me like something that did not happen.'
Miss Boothroyd said she regarded what the prime minister had said as
unparliamentary. 'It is for me to decide whether the rephrasing of it was
acceptable. I deemed it was acceptable,' she said.
