FT  27 JAN 94 / Libya demands repayments


   By Agencies


   SIRTE


Libya's economy minister yesterday demanded that foreign countries pay back
money they owe or risk losing the assets of their companies working in
Libya, agencies report from Sirte.
Mr Omar Mustafa el-Montasser told a session of the General People's Congress
that Libya was owed from abroad a total of Dollars 1.353bn (Pounds 900m) and
FFr22bn (Pounds 2.47bn) , including interest on delayed payments.
The minister said his government had asked the countries involved to
reimburse cash. Those unable to do so would reimburse Libya in various ways
from the assets of their companies in Libya, or through imports of goods and
products from their countries, or by Libya taking stakes in their companies.
The source of the minister's figures was not clear. It was not known whether
he meant Libya would seize the assets of some foreign companies in Libya.
Many foreign firms work in Libya's oil industry.
His statement appeared to mark retaliation for UN sanctions imposed on Libya
because of its refusal to hand over for trial two agents suspected of
carrying out the bombing of a Pan Am aircraft over Lockerbie, Scotland, in
1988. The sanctions were tightened in December to include a freeze of Libyan
assets abroad and a ban on imports of certain oil equipment.
Prime minister Abouzid Omar Dourdah said on Sunday that Libya had sharply
cut its budget forecast for 1994 because of difficulties caused by the
sanctions.
'The cut amounts to several billions (of dollars),' he said after a
commission of the Congress had adopted the draft budget. 'As a result of the
unjust UN sanctions, we have been forced to cut our expenses in several
domains like education and health.'
