telecoms group

THREE Swedish companies - Volvo the vehicle maker, Trelleborg the mining
group and the high-tech company Spectra-Physics - are to sell a 51 per cent
stake in NordicTel Holdings, a mobile Swedish telecommunications group, to
Pacific Telesis of the US for Dollars 153m.
The sale will raise around SKr340m (Dollars 44m) for Volvo and
Spectra-Physics and SKr200m for Trelleborg. All three will remain
shareholders in NordicTel, each with 8 per cent.
NordicTel is one of three companies in Sweden operating a digital cellular
GSM telephone network. This offers superior voice quality to traditional
analog services and allows subscribers to receive and send calls in other
European countries with the same technology.
NordicTel, which began service late in 1992, operates under the name
Europolitan and has still to complete its network, which covers about 80 per
cent of the Swedish population. It also owns a 20 per cent stake in the
private Danish GSM operator Dansk Mobiltelefon.
Britain's Vodafone mobile communications group owns a 25 per cent stake in
NordicTel.
Mr Lee Cox, chief executive of PacTel, the Pacific Telesis subsidiary making
the acquisition, said Scandinavia was a very attractive cellular market.
Pacific Telesis owns a 26 per cent stake in Mannesmann Mobilfunk, which owns
and operates D2 Privat, which claims to be the world's largest digital
cellular network.
