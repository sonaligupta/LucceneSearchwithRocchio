FT  06 JAN 94 / Scots newspapers to cut 220 jobs


Forty-four jobs are to be lost out of an editorial total of 220 on the
Scottish Daily Record and Sunday Mail, the company told journalists'
representatives yesterday.
A journalists' spokesman said: 'The management told us they are wanting
talks to restructure the company which would lead to a reduction of some 44
editorial people ultimately.'
Senior executives at Mirror Group Newspapers, which own the two Scots
titles, said last night said the job losses were part of an 'upgrading' of
staff in which new journalists would be appointed.
