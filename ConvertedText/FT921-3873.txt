FT  12 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Ansbacher incurs Pounds 8.2m loss


   By DAVID BARCHARD


HENRY ANSBACHER, the small City merchant bank, incurred a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 8.23m in the year to December 31, 1991, after making heavy provisions
to offset losses on loans to small businesses.
In 1990, the group made profits of Pounds 2.46m. The loss per share was 5.1p
(0.1p earnings) and as a result of the poor performance, the dividend has
been cut from 1.5p to a nominal 0.01p. The nominal payment was made to
preserve the authorised investment status of the company's shares under the
Trustee Investments Act.
The bank said that the 1991 results were disappointing and did little
justice to the underlying strength of the group which was currently trading
profitably.
The merchant banking arm of the group turned in a loss of Pounds 9.87m,
compared with Pounds 1m profit.
Third world debt trading and offshore banking put in strong performances and
the London corporate finance operation earned record levels of fee income
and made what was described as an encouraging amount of progress.
Other arms of the bank did less well. There were losses by the mergers and
acquisitions division
Central costs fell from Pounds 1.8m to Pounds 1.64m.
The loan book at the year end was Pounds 126m and has since reduced further
to Pounds 114m. The bank's total balance sheet has shrunk from Pounds
678.16m at the end of 1990 to Pounds 619.53m.
