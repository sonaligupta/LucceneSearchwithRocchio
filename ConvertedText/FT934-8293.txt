UNITED Communication Industry (Ucom) yesterday became the latest Thai
telecommunications group to announce an initial public offering of its
shares to help finance expansion in the fast-growing Thai market.
Ucom, whose parent company is 25 per cent owned by Motorola of the US, said
it planned to raise about Dollars 120m by offering 17m new shares to be
traded on the Stock Exchange of Thailand in January. The new shares will
account for 14 per cent of Ucom's enlarged capital.
Between 30 and 35 per cent of the shares issued will be sold to foreign
investors, Ucom executives said. SG Warburg is lead underwriter for the
foreign tranche, and a roadshow to publicise the offering starts in Hong
Kong next week before moving on to London, Edinburgh, Boston and New York.
Ucom supplies telecommunications equipment to Thai clients and operates
wireless communications systems. The company said it would use the money
raised to finance its new digital cellular telephone concession and to
develop its two-way radio business aimed at such markets as airports,
construction sites and the police.
TelecomAsia, the Charoen Pokphand subsidiary which has a concession to
install 2m new telephone lines in Bangkok and owns 6.25 per cent of Ucom,
recently announced plans to raise at least Dollars 400m through its own
partial public flotation.
Loxley, whose subsidiary Thai Telephone and Telecommunication is
concessionaire for 1m new lines to be installed in the provinces, is also
going public and intends to raise about Dollars 50m by selling 22.5 per cent
of its shares.
