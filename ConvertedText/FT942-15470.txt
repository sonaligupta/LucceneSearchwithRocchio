FT  15 APR 94 / Brazilian MPs expelled


The Brazilian Congress has expelled two members over a bribery scandal,
congressional officials said yesterday, agencies report from Braslia.
The legislature voted late on Wednesday to strip Mr Carlos Benevides of his
mandate. He is the son of a former senior congressman and was a leading
member of the Democratic Movement Party (PMDB), the biggest in Congress.
Earlier, a substitute legislator, Mr Feres Nader of the Brazil Labour Party
(PTB), was also expelled.
The two were the first to be sanctioned among 17 deputies recommended for
expulsion by a special Congressional commission examining a bribery scandal
that shocked Brazil when it came to light last October.
The 17 are accused of having manipulated public funds and having received
bribes to obtain public contracts for private contractors.
Three of the 17 accused have resigned their mandates rather than risk being
stipped of them.
Apart from losing their Congressional seats, the expelled deputies will be
barred from public office for three years.
