FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Holders bid to oust Andrews Sykes board


   By TIM BURT


Rebel shareholders at Andrews Sykes, the lossmaking industrial services
group, yesterday launched a bid to oust the board in a re-run of a similar
coup attempt 18 months ago.
Dissidents led by Mr Jacques Murray, who holds 29.2 per cent of the Midlands
company, have called an extraordinary meeting at which they hope to win
management control.
A spokesman for Mr Murray, chairman of Nu-Swift, the fire protection group,
said the move reflected dissatisfaction with Sykes' performance.
Last December, the group reported interim pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.34m
(Pounds 802,000 profit).
'We want to support the company and bring about an improvement,' Mr Murray's
spokesman added.
Mr David Hubbard, group chairman, said the board would fight the rebel
action and would seek the support of institutional shareholders.
Opposition by institutional investors defeated Mr Murray 18 months ago after
the last battle for control. Andrews Sykes has now offered Mr Murray board
representation, but not majority control. His spokesman said the offer had
not been rejected, but described the extraordinary meeting as a parallel
tactic.
Andrews Sykes shares closed up 5p at 90p.
