FT  05 NOV 93 / Yeltsin accused of impeding fair Russian election: EC
delegation hears litany of complaints

   MOSCOW


PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin is thwarting a free and fair election by depriving
opposition parties and groups of media coverage and facilities to organise
ahead of the polls due in December, a European parliamentary delegation was
told in Moscow this week.
Allegations of corruption have also been made against some of the parties
trying to collect the required 100,000 signatures needed by midnight tonight
to qualify for registration.
At least 32 main parties are trying to gather the signatures and most are
likely to qualify.
Ms Magdalena Hoff, leader of a delegation of European Community
parliamentarians which visited Moscow this week, heard a litany of
complaints about the electoral process, the most serious from parties on the
communist left and nationalist right.
The strongest allegation came from Mr Sergei Baburin, leader of the Russian
National Union and a former hardline deputy, who said that his telephone and
those of many of his colleagues had been cut off and he had been told he
could meet foreign correspondents in his home only with the permission of
the authorities.
Mr Baburin said that the home telephones of all those deputies who had
stayed in the Russian parliament throughout the siege had been cut. He said
the loss of communications made it difficult to organise the collection of
signatures.
Mr Genady Zyuganov, leader of the Russian Communist party, said he had
written to Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, first deputy prime minister, asking for a
meeting to protest against media bias  - but had received no reply.
'At the moment, news broadcasts begin with (Mr Yegor) Gaidar (the first
deputy prime minister and head of the liberal Russia's Choice group) and end
with Gaidar.'
Like Mr Baburin, he complained bitterly about the continued suppression of
far right and left papers, such as Sovyetskaya Rossiya and Den.
From the centrist groups, Mr Arkady Volsky, leader of the Civic Union, said
that the press  - much of it still subsidised by the state  - was heavily
biased in favour of the pro-presidential groups, such as Russia's Choice. He
had told Mr Hoff, he said, that 'we don't need observers on election day, we
need them now'.
Mr Nikolai Travkin, leader of the Democratic party, said the presidentially
appointed heads of administration in the regions and republics had been told
to use their offices to gather signatures for themselves.
He said calling elections on a tight schedule with unclear rules 'had one
justification  - securing the legitimacy of the current power. It is
political piracy'. He admitted, however, that it could avert a social
explosion.
Most of the main groups now claim to have or be near to securing the
signatures needed for registration  - but there are numerous allegations of
buying votes.
Mr Volsky said votes were being bought for packets of cigarettes (though not
by his group)  - while the daily Izvestia gave a number of instances,
witnessed by its correspondents, of candidates paying what appears to be a
going rate of 100 roubles (about 6p) per signature.
