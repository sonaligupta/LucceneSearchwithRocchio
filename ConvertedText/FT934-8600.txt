FT  15 NOV 93 / Tax increase will not jeopardise economic recovery


THE chancellor can rest assured that a significant tax increase in the
forthcoming Budget to close the fiscal deficit will not jeopardise economic
recovery, the latest projections from Oxford Economic Forecasting show.
The Oxford economists argue that Mr Kenneth Clarke can and should raise
taxes by Pounds 4bn to Pounds 5bn on November 30. They expect interest rates
to be cut by half a percentage point and forecast that, even with this
easier monetary policy, the annual rate of underlying inflation will remain
below the government's target ceiling of 4 per cent throughout next year.
The report forecasts that, even with a further fiscal tightening, the
economy will grow by 1.9 per cent this year, revised upwards from their
August forecasts, and by 2.7 per cent in 1994.
The public sector borrowing requirement is expected to reach Pounds 50bn
this financial year before falling to Pounds 37bn in 1994-95.
