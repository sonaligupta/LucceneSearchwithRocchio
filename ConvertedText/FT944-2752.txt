FT  16 DEC 94 / International Company News: Berlin bank proposes to raise
dividend


   By JUDY DEMPSEY


   BERLIN


Bankgesellschaft Berlin, Germany's sixth largest bank, intends to raise its
divided for 1994, Mr Hubertus Moser, co-chairman, said yesterday.
The plan to lift the dividend from last year's DM9 by at least DM1 was
announced as the bank gave details of 10-month results.
The bank was formed through the merger last January of the state-owned
Landesbank Berlin, the private Berliner Bank, and the private Berliner
Hypotheken-und Pfandbriefbank mortgage banks.
The bank's consolidated business volume rose to DM234.5bn (Dollars 147bn)
for the first 10 months of the year, compared with DM222bn during the first
six months of its operations. Real comparative figures on a year-on-year
basis will only be available in 1995.
Consolidated operating results rose to DM999m compared with DM734m from
January to June. After taking into account risk provisions amounting to
DM608m, operating results totalled DM669m.
The risk provisions, which amounted to DM326m during the first half of 1994,
had been increased because of Bankgesellschaft's exposure of DM100m to
Balsam, the sports grounds company which earlier this year ran up large
debts. The bank had a further DM70m of exposure from the collapse of the
Jurgen Schneider property company.
