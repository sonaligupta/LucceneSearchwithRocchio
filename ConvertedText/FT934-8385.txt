   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY


Peter Medawar said that psychoanalysis was the most stupendous confidence
trick of the century. He was a proper scientist of course who won the Nobel
Prize. He could see what the analysis addicts can't: that Freudianism has
more in common with astrology and religious faith than with real science.
Eventually Freud will be seen as an influence on twentieth century
literature and an irrelevance in mental health. In the excellent C4 series
Without Walls (9.00) Peter Swales considers the absurdity of the Freud
craze.
If you thought last night's opening episode of the American serial Wild
Palms (BBC2, 9.00) was surreal and gripping then you will want to watch Part
2 today. If you thought it pretentious claptrap then you won't.
In the first series of Between The Lines (BBC1, 9.30) Tony seemed to be
getting his leg over almost every week and Mo offered the first sympathetic
portrait of a lesbian in peaktime drama. Now Tony is being desperately
long-winded with Angela and Mo seems to have become bisexual. Good job there
is a police story to sustain the interest
