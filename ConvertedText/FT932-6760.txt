FT  27 MAY 93 / VW seeks big sales expansion


   By KEVIN DONE


THE VOLKSWAGEN group, the largest European carmaker, aims to increase the
market share of its VW and Audi makes in the UK market for new cars by about
50 per cent during the next five years, Kevin Done writes.
Volkswagen acquired VAG (United Kingdom), the British distributor of
Volkswagen and Audi vehicles, from Lonrho, the UK-based international
trading group, for Pounds 124m at the end of last year.
Following the takeover the German carmaker wants to expand substantially its
presence in Britain, which has traditionally been one of its weakest markets
in Europe. Together the VW and Audi makes captured about 14.7 per cent of
west European new car sales last year, but held a share of only 5.2 per cent
in the UK.
The company has set a target of capturing 7.5 per cent of UK new-car sales
by 1998.
VW will change its traditional premium pricing in the UK and be seeking
higher fleet and company car sales.
