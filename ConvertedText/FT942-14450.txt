FT  20 APR 94 / UK Company News: Weak clothing sales leave Bodycote lower


   By TIM BURT


Shares in Bodycote Inter-national fell 13p to 292p yesterday as the metal
technology, packaging and textiles group blamed weak clothing sales for a 13
per cent decline in profits.
Falling demand for Bodycote's workwear range - produced by EHCO-KLM, its
Dutch subsidiary - pushed pre-tax profits down from Pounds 13.6m to Pounds
11.8m in the year to December 31.
Citing shrinking margins in continental Europe, the company said it had been
forced to close one of its two Dutch plants.
The Pounds 435,000 cost of closing the Haaksbergen plant, where there were
70 redundancies, contributed to a reduction in operating profits to Pounds
12m (Pounds 13.7m).
Mr Roger Green, finance director, said: 'Pricing has been cut-throat and we
were disappointed with the figures, particularly in Holland.'
Although profits fell from Pounds 2.3m to Pounds 511,000 at EHCO-KLM, which
manufactures protective clothing and uniforms, Mr Green said that orders had
picked up in recent months.
The industrial division, meanwhile, reported reduced profits of Pounds 2.37m
(Pounds 2.45m) following a management reorganisation at Stockpack, its
packaging subsidiary.
That flat performance was offset partially by Metal Technology, Bodycote's
main forging and reinforcement business, where profits rose from Pounds
9.25m to Pounds 9.77m.
Mr Green said the metals division had been boosted by increased demand for
its 'hot isostatic process', which strengthens and reinforces aluminium and
steel cast-ings.
Of the group's Pounds 15m investment programme last year, Pounds 5.2m was
spent on HIP facilities and he predicted it would be the mainstay of future
growth.
Although the division reported increased sales of Pounds 41.4m (Pounds
38.2m), it failed to stem a 6.6 per cent decline in group turnover to Pounds
75m.
Nevertheless, Mr Green expressed optimism about sales this year and said
acquisitions were likely.
Earnings per share fell from 15.8p to 14.1p, but Mr Green said confidence
about future prospects justified a final dividend of 3.25p, making a total
of 5.25p (5p).
