FT  02 NOV 93 / Midlands rail freight depot proposed


   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent


ABBCOTT Estates, a private property company half-owned by Severn Trent
Water, yesterday asked Daventry District Council for planning permission to
construct a rail freight terminal with 2.3m sq ft of associated
manufacturing and distribution floorspace.
The move emphasises the growing importance as sites for distribution depots
of Midlands open land or surplus industrial sites close to the M1, M6 and
M42 motorways. It reflects the assumption that rail freight traffic will
increase after the Channel tunnel opens next year.
The Abbcott scheme, covering 160 acres five miles south of the M1/M6
interchange, would cost Pounds 140m to complete, but the terminal could
start operations after an investment of Pounds 35m on infrastructure.
The Daventry terminal could open in November 1995, depending on planning
procedures. It is then likely to be in competition with the terminal at
Landor Street, Birmingham, operated and recently expanded by Railfreight
Distribution, a British Rail subsidiary.
Railfreight Distribution has been examining sites in the Midlands to secure
long-term facilities after Landor Street reaches full capacity. It is
awaiting the result of a public planning inquiry over a proposed terminal
and business village at Hams Hall, east of Birmingham.
