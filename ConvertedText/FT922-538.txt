FT  26 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading


   By JOEL KIBAZO


A SQUEEZE in stock index futures helped the September contract shake off
recent gloom and move firmly ahead, writes Joel Kibazo.
Having opened positively at 2,588, the September FT-SE contract briefly went
into retreat as independent sellers moved to the selling tack. But the
decline did not last long, as large institutions that had remained on the
sidelines over the last few sessions re-entered the market on the view that
it had been oversold.
Except for occasional lulls, September continued forward for the rest of the
session at a healthy premium. The contract reached the day's high of 2,609
towards the end of the session. September closed at 2,603, up 21 from the
previous day and about 60 points above its estimated fair value premium to
cash of about 35. Turnover at 7,231 was, however, unexceptional.
Volume in traded options returned to more modest levels and the day's total
reached 37,629 contracts. Turnover in the FT-SE option was a poor 7,180
lots. In stock options, British Steel, which reports results on Monday, was
the most heavily traded with 3,032 contracts dealt.
