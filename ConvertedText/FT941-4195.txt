FT  12 MAR 94 / Woman tipped for cabinet post

   SYDNEY


Carmen Lawrence (left), former premier of Western Australia, is set to
secure a federal cabinet position provided she wins the Fremantle
by-election today, senior ministers have indicated. Campaigning in Fremantle
on Ms Lawrence's behalf, Senator Graham Richardson, one of the most
influential figures in the Labor Party, said he believed Ms Lawrence 'will
win (a cabinet position) and she will win very comfortably'. He declined to
say which jobs she might be offered. Despite the Labor Party's lack of
popularity in Western Australia, Ms Lawrence is a well-liked local figure
and is not expected to have any difficulty holding the Fremantle seat. Ms
Lawrence's sensible style and popular appeal have caused speculation that
she could be a future Labor prime minister.
