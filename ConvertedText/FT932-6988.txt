FT  26 MAY 93 / Observer: Tiny ducks the battle


If seasoned observers of Lonrho's embattled boss Tiny Rowland are still not
sated after tonight's BBC documentary on the rebel tycoon and Tom Bower's
new biography, then they ought to dip in to 'Tiny Rowland: the ugly face of
neocolonialism', published by an organisation linked to US political oddball
Lyndon LaRouche. Even Rowland's harshest critics will find it impossible to
swallow the latter's conspiracy theories about Rowland.
Indeed, one of the reasons that people seem to be able to say all sorts of
outrageous things is because Rowland has never been known to sue for libel.
Is it pride, or anxiety about what he might be asked if he was to be
cross-examined in court? Until now Tiny has limited himself to long
complaining letters. But now Mrs Rowland is threatening to sue. Isn't it
about time the one-time Scharfuhrer in the Hitler Youth followed suit?
