FT  03 AUG 92 / Observer: Close shave


A top official appearing in court with a bandaged hand might not set tongues
a-wagging in most countries. But it did in Russia when Boris Yeltsin's
special representative Sergei Shakhrai arrived wearing a bandage at the
hearings on the legality of the former Soviet Communist party.
Suspicions of a sinister attempt to nobble him were increased by news that
the injury was one he'd been lucky to escape with. He suffered it when his
speeding car hit a tree after being forced off the road by another, which
then raced off.
But it turns out that his assailants were not so much political as
paralytic. Apparently Shakhrai's limousine had earlier overtaken the other
car with an arrogance that nettled its three drunken occupants - the chief
of a Moscow hairdressing salon who owned it, and two companions. So they
caught up and made a ramming attack.
As its success seemed worthy of celebration, they parked a mile away and
took to the bottle again. The car's owner then staggered back alone to the
scene of the crash, where he overheard bystanders saying who had been hurt.
That sent him back to his friends and a third go at the bottle, during which
they resolved to conceal their guilt.
Their efforts, however, were in vain. The number of the car had been noted
when it made the attack, and the barber-shop manager was put under locks.
