FT  25 MAY 93 / UK Company News: BP in talks over Pounds 250m consumer
products sale


   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES


BRITISH Petroleum is negotiating the sale of the consumer products division
of its Nutrition business for Pounds 250m to an investment group headed by
Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman of Grand Metropolitan, the food and drinks
conglomerate.
Legal and General, the insurance group, is heading the consortium of 10
investors which include Lehman Brothers, the US investment bankers.
The sale involves BP Nutrition's three main consumer products interests in
the UK, Italy and Belgium.
BP put its nutrition division up for sale just over a year ago in order to
concentrate on its core oil and gas business.
It sold the consumer foods division to Sara Lee, the US foods and consumer
products group, in December.
The sale of consumer products leaves BP's US animal feeds business: Purina
still to divest.
BP has appointed financial advisors to assist with the sale. It also has a
smaller European animal feeds business.
