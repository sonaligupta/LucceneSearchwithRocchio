FT  04 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Kleinwort Benson sells bullion house to
Deutsche Bank


   By KENNETH GOODING and DAVID WALLER


DEUTSCHE BANK, Germany's biggest bank, is buying Sharps Pixley, the bullion
and metals business.
Sharps can trace its origins back to the 1740s and is one of the five
members of the committee which fixes the gold price daily in London.
Lord Rockley, chairman of Kleinwort Benson, the merchant banking group which
owns Sharps, said the bullion house 'has been a good investment over the
years but today a commercial bank is a better place for it to realise its
potential'. He admitted that Sharps had not been a great contributor to
group profits.
The price, which would be related to Sharps' net assets plus a figure for
goodwill, has still to be agreed but it would not result in any charge to
Kleinwort's accounts. Sharps employees would be transferred with the
business.
Deutsche said the acquisition should be seen as a strategic move designed to
expand its precious metals trading activities.
The bank is active in gold and silver markets around the world. It is one of
the three largest traders of South African gold, has a 50 per cent share of
the German gold trading market and is an important company in the the
Australian nugget market. It aims to become a marketmaker in London where at
present it only trades precious metals.
Sharps is also one of the three companies operating the London Silver Fixing
and became a ring dealing member of the London Metal Exchange in 1979.
Through its New York operations it is a member of the New York Commodity
Exchange.
