FT  27 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Tax distortions on drinks harming UK
pubs


   From Mr ROBIN SIMPSON


Sir, Your leader 'Cross-Channel Shopping' (January 25) has some curious
arguments. You seem to be saying that lower beer prices in supermarkets hurt
pubs, but not lower beer prices from duty-paid imports] The facts are
obvious. At least one in every seven pints drunk at home is a duty-paid
import. This must hurt everyone who produces and sells beer in the UK,
including pubs, clubs, off-licences and supermarkets - some 100,000
businesses employing around 500,000. On-licensed premises represent around
74 per cent of UK licensed outlets and are suffering accordingly.
The loss of revenue to the chancellor is at least Pounds 160m from beer duty
and VAT. But it extends beyond that, damaging sources of all kinds of tax
revenue from the businesses and individuals affected.
On pricing, your readers would not have guessed that wholesale beer prices,
net of tax and discounts, have decreased relative to the retail prices index
over the past three years. Externally imposed service costs on pubs have
increased well above RPI. Beer prices in pubs, net of tax, are almost the
lowest in the whole of the European Union; only Portugal is lower. Something
has to give and the need is for fair competition in the single market,
without distortion by the UK tax system.
