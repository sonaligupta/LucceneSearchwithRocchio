FT  26 JUN 92 / Campaign to raise style in industry


   By GARY MEAD


EIGHT companies yesterday launched The Walpole Committee to try to promote
British industry's reputation for style and quality in goods and services,
Gary Mead writes.
The committee has been founded by British Airways, Chewton Glen (a hotel and
country club), Coutts, the Daks Simpson group, Dawson International, the
Financial Times, the Savoy group and William Grant and Sons.
The committee chose the name Walpole as a tribute to Robert Walpole,
Britain's first prime minister. It has appointed as its director Sir Gordon
Jewkes, a former diplomat whose last post was Director-General of British
Trade and Investment USA and Consul-General in New York.
The committee's work will include:
Creation of the Walpole collection, assembling British products and services
combining design excellence and traditional quality.
The 'setting up of new opportunities for young and established talent'.
'Research into and support for existing and new training programmes.'
'Where necessary, representation to the government on crucial industry
affairs.'
