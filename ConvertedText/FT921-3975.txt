FT  11 MAR 92 / Observer: Lamont the lugubrious


Whatever the result of the general election, Norman Lamont will go down as
the man who abolished the budget. It seems unlikely, however, that he will
continue as chancellor even if the Conservatives win. Something has happened
to this normally engaging man that suggests he has become bogged down in
Treasury detail.
Perhaps precisely because it was the last traditional budget but one that he
read the greater part of his speech in such a lugubrious tone. In the
sections on tax on company cars and monthly Vat returns, he seemed visibly
bored. It was 54 minutes before he made his first joke, and even that was a
rather feeble one about Benjamin Franklin saying that nothing was certain
except death and taxes.
He referred to the married couple's allowance as the mca or 'male chauvinist
allowance' and made one ringing statement: 'I will not accept any deal in
Brussels that would ride roughshod over the interests of the British cider
industry.' For the rest, however, he seemed prepared to accept the Treasury
prose as it came. The official text actually bears the word 'peroration'
before the final few paragraphs, and always has: it was not a peroration
written by a politician.
The next Tory chancellor needs to look less gloomy, which rules out quite a
lot of the men sitting alongside Lamont yesterday. The Labour front bench,
with its liberal sprinkling of women, looked much more attractive.
