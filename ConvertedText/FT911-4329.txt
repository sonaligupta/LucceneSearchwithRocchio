FT  19 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Treasury rejects arbitration over
Civil Service offer


   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent


THE government yesterday rejected calls for arbitration over an 8 per cent
pay offer to more than 300,000 civil servants which union leaders say breaks
the spirit of long-term agreements.
Executives of the CPSA and NUCPS unions will meet on Monday to decide their
next moves. Mr Leslie Christie, NUCPS general secretary, said his members
were increasingly angry about the offer and an industrial action ballot
would be one option considered.
Under the agreements, Civil Service settlements should normally fall within
the middle range of deals agreed among comparable workers in the private
sector during the previous year. During the past year the private sector
middle range was 8 per cent to 10 per cent.
The unions say the spirit of the agreements has been broken because most of
their members will receive 7.6 per cent in the case of the CPSA and 7.8 per
cent in the case of NUCPS. The overall figures are boosted to 8 per cent by
adjustments for a minority of staff.
The Treasury, in a letter to the unions, said that pay should be determined
by what is required to recruit, motivate and retain staff and that
recruitment and retention have improved considerably. Controlling public
spending remains central to the government's economic strategy and
arbitration is 'not appropriate'.
In pay negotiations affecting other groups of workers, the Prison Officers'
Association said it had rejected a 7.75 per cent pay offer in negotiations
with the Treasury. Further discussions are due this month.
Lloyds Group Union said its managerial members at Lloyds Bank had voted to
reject pay rises of between 3 per cent and 4 per cent.
