FT  15 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Tribune Newspapers


Tribune Newspapers, the Dublin-based printing and publishing group, swung
back into losses at the operating level in the year to June 30.
Despite a marginal increase in turnover to IPounds 6.54m (Pounds 6.43m)
there was an operating loss of IPounds 1.17m against a profit of IPounds
56,000 last time. At the pre-tax level, losses deepened to IPounds 1.56m
(IPounds 471,000).
A new editor was appointed in April, and Mr Gordon Colleary, the chairman,
said it was now the board's intention to raise new equity and to carry out a
financial reconstruction early in 1995, with the aim of bringing the
debt/equity ratio back to a more acceptable level.
