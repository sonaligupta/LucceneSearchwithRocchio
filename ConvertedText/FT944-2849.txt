FT  15 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Gatt deal sparks violence


Demonstrators clash with marines in the Philippines yesterday during a vote
on the Uruguay Round trade treaty by senators. The senate ratified the
accord as protesters tried to storm the building. Anti-Gatt senators said
they would challenge the constitutionality of the pact, arguing the economy
would be devastated by the massive inflow of imports the new trade accord
would allow. Eighteen out of 23 senators voted in favour of the Philippines
joining the new World Trade Organisation, two votes more than needed to
ratify a treaty.
