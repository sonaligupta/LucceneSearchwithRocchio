FT  15 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Yield curves


World bond markets are in the throes of 'curve compression'. In the past few
weeks there has been a swift flattening of yield curves, with long-term
interest rates dropping as short and medium-term rates have risen.
The trigger for the flattening, the most rapid since the early 1980s, is the
tough monetary stance being taken by the US Federal Reserve. Investors are
expecting further US rate rises of up to 75 basis points within three months
with another 50 points coming shortly afterwards. The Fed should be given
credit for its recent monetary rectitude, but markets may be getting ahead
of themselves.
A flattening yield curve usually indicates a slowing economy and the
imminent approach of peak interest rates. These conditions are not fulfilled
in the US. First, the economy is steaming ahead and weakness is not likely
to show itself until next spring. Second, it is uncertain that the Fed will
move in the way markets expect: after all, it has already tightened more
aggressively than most expected earlier in the year.
The UK and the economies of Australia and New Zealand follow the US economic
cycle more closely than those of continental Europe. It is thus
understandable that yield curves have taken their cue from the US, even if
the same objections remain. In the UK, for example, a burst of consumer
spending in the run-up to Christmas could make the beginning of a downturn
look remote and interest rates have a long way to go before they peak.
There is still less reason for the curve compression which has taken place
in Germany, where the economy lags the US by at least 18 months. Here, the
next move in rates could as well be down as up. If it is up, the move is
unlikely to come until the second half of next year. In Germany, as in other
bond markets, the flattening of yield curves looks premature.
