FT  16 MAR 94 / Survey of Information and Communications Technology (27): A
new world on your desktop - Clever software helps cut the cost of virtual
reality


   By PHILIP MANCHESTER


One of the most important recent developments in Virtual Reality (VR) is the
fall in prices of hardware and software packages.
VR systems demand large computer resources and high-quality input and output
 -which has been expensive until recently.
But advances in hardware technology, such as faster PC processors, larger
capacity storage and graphics software have made desktop systems possible.
The most important element is the clever software which is needed firstly,
to build a virtual reality to suit a specific need and, secondly, allow a
user to visit and inter-act with it.
UK-based software developer Dimension sees a growing opportunity in the
emerging commercial market for VR tools on the desktop.
Its Superscape package, which sells for around Pounds 3,500, can be used to
build specific VR environments on a desktop computer.
The package has a broad range of users from British Telecom, which has built
a virtual network with Superscape, to the Shepherd School, which is using VR
to help children with learning difficulties.
One of the more exciting applications of Superscape is Tyne and Wear
Development Corporation's creation of VR model of the Pounds 180m Quayside
development in Newcastle.
The VR Quayside is being used to view how the development will look in
advance and sell it to prospective investors.
