FT  25 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Goal Petroleum profits fall 16%


   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES


GOAL Petroleum, the small North Sea oil exploration company, saw a 16 per
cent rise in net profits to Pounds 6.6m last year, compared with Pounds
5.69m in 1990, writes Deborah Hargreaves.
Earnings per share amounted to 4.92p (4.24p) and Goal is proposing a 14 per
cent dividend increase to 1.25p.
At the pre-tax level profits fell to Pounds 10.1m (Pounds 10.6m).
The company increased production over the year by 21 per cent to 11,460
barrels a day. Turnover improved from Pounds 41.7m to Pounds 44.8m.
'We have a very good mix of low-cost production and many of our fields don't
pay tax which means the company is looking robust against the current low
oil price,' Mr David Boyd, managing director, said.
