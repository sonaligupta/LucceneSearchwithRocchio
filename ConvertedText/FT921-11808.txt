FT  30 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Major backs drive on jobs for disabled


   By DIANE SUMMERS and ALISON SMITH


MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, yesterday gave his backing to a
business-led initiative to improve the job prospects of Britain's 6m
disabled adults.
The campaign, similar to the Opportunity 2000 initiative on women's
employment launched in October, is being supported by 21 companies,
including Barclays, Midland and National Westminster banks, and Grand
Metropolitan.
Mr Major said at the launch of the 10-point agenda for action, which is
being put forward by the Employers' Forum on Disability, that he would be
'commending the principles' to his cabinet colleagues.
But Mr Major was challenged by Labour to substantiate his commitment by
supporting a backbench bill on civil rights for disabled people due to be
debated in the Commons tomorrow.
Mr Alf Morris, the Labour MP sponsoring the bill, said his measure would
make employers respect the existing law which requires companies with 20 or
more employees to give 3 per cent of jobs to disabled people. Only 22 per
cent of employers meet that quota.
