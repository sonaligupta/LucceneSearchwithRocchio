FT  19 APR 91 / UK Company News: Pay of Booker chief rose 85% to Pounds 0.3m
in 1990


   By MAGGIE URRY


Mr Jonathan Taylor, chief executive of Booker, the food distribution and
agribusiness group, saw his pay rise 85 per cent to Pounds 331,459 last
year.
However, the previous year he had suffered a 25 per cent pay cut to Pounds
178,791 even though the group achieved higher profits and earnings per share
in that year.
Mr Taylor said that at Booker 'we operate a proper incentive scheme'. Up to
60 per cent of his salary can be made from bonuses linked to growth in
earnings and profits. Last year he received virtually no performance-related
pay.
In 1990 pre-tax profits rose 21 per cent to Pounds 119.7m and earnings were
12.9 per cent higher at 41.9p. Total pay for the directors was Pounds 1.6m
(Pounds 1.1m).
