FT  05 JUN 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Cable television takes on CDs


   By VALERIE WHITE


US cable networks typically provide viewers with the choice of around 50 TV
channels, ranging from re-transmission of local broadcast stations to
specialist premium pay-TV channels, writes Valerie White.
Now subscribers are being offered an additional range of 30 sound channels.
But unlike the TV channels, where the source and the transmission are
analogue, these sound channels are fully digital, bringing CD-quality sound
directly into the home.
To receive them a tuner, costing Dollars 199 (Pounds 110), is needed which
plugs into any cable TV socket. The output from the tuner is then connected
to the stereo system, or to headphones. A fully digital output is also
available for connection to a Dat (Digital Audio Tape) recorder.
Each sound channel carries continuous music from about 180 CDs catering for
most tastes and giving around six days of play without repetition.
The service is being provided by Los Angeles-based Digital Music Express
initially on two cable channels in Atlanta, Georgia and costs Dollars 6.95 a
month. Digital Music Express: US, 310 444 1744.
