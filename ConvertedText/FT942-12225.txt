FT  30 APR 94 / International Company News: LTV back in the black despite
effects of winter

   NEW YORK


LTV, the third-largest US steelmaker, yesterday said it managed to return to
profit in the first quarter despite the impact of harsh winter weather on
its operations.
The group posted net income of Dollars 15.3m, or 16 cents a share, reversing
a loss of Dollars 47.7m in the same period of 1993.
The result, which exceeded the forecasts of most analysts, extended a record
of steady improvement by LTV since it emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection last June.
LTV, along with the rest of the US steel industry, continued to benefit from
rising production, greater operating efficiencies and improved prices. Sales
in the car industry showed no signs of flagging during the quarter.
Revenues from core steel operations, which accounted for 93 per cent of the
total sales of Dollars 1.07bn, showed an 8 per cent gain. Shipments were up
just 3 per cent, at 1.93m tons. But with steel facilities working at 99 per
cent of capacity, LTV was able to realise higher average selling prices.
However, conditions during the winter led to power cuts, disrupted
deliveries and complicated handling of raw materials which pulled operating
profits down by Dollars 13m. The negative effect on the bottom line was
offset by Dollars 14.4m in favourable state and local tax settlements during
the quarter.
