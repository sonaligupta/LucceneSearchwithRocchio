FT  27 SEP 94 / Survey of Mauritius (5): Enter the foreign investor - The
rise of the stock exchange


   By TONY HAWKINS and LESLIE CRAWFORD


By any reckoning, the Mauritius Stock Exchange has outperformed the most
optimistic expectations of its founders. In just five years, it has come
from nowhere to be ranked number three in Sub-Saharan Africa, after
Johannesburg and Harare, with a market capitalisation at the end of August
of MRs26.9bn.
The number of official market listings has increased from five, when the
Stock Exchange of Mauritius (SEM) was launched as a private limited company
in July 1989, to 31 today. The share price index (Semdex), reached a high of
462 at the end of August, up nearly 70 per cent since mid-1993.
This performance is all the more remarkable given the virtual exclusion of
foreign investors from the market. Unlike most emerging markets, the SEM has
been driven by domestic investors, primarily institutions.
In his 1994 budget, Ramakrishna Sithanen, the finance minister, opened the
door to foreign participation, which is likely to be limited to 24 per cent
ownership of any listed company, with no single foreign investor allowed to
hold more than 5 per cent of the equity in a listed Mauritian company.
Foreign participation could push the market much higher, partly reflecting
fund manager perceptions that the Mauritian price-earnings ratio, averaging
15 (excluding investment holding companies), is below the emerging market
average, but also as good quality shares are hard to find. Four companies
dominate market capitalisation. Conglomerate Rogers and Co, capitalised at
MRs4.1bn and the Mauritius Commercial Bank (MRs4.05bn), make up 30 per cent
of the market.
If Sun Resorts, the hotel group ranked number three with MRs3bn and Ireland
Blyth, a major shareholder in Sun (MRs2.3bn) are included, the four giants
account for half the market. The market desperately needs more paper.
Two major new listings are in the pipeline; commercial conglomerate Happy
World, possibly one of the island's best-run companies, and Air Mauritius,
the flagship of the government's privatisation programme. Air Mauritius will
issue MRs500m of new shares, which may well catch the imagination of foreign
buyers, given the booming tourism sector and the backing from British
Airways in the form of its 12 per cent stake in the national carrier.
Other privatisation issues in the pipeline include State Bank, the State
Investment Corporation, Sitcom, and Mauritius Telecom, implying new issues
of up to MRs2bn.
The SEM operates two markets - the official market where the 31 listed
companies are traded and an over-the-counter market which deals in unlisted
companies. The OTC market, which came on stream in April 1990, now comprises
some 71 companies, many of which are likely to move upmarket to 'official'
status over the next few years.
Listing requirements include an 'adequate' trading record, with published
accounts for three years before listing; an expected market capitalisation
of MRs20m and the issue of at least 25 per cent of the shares to the public,
though this threshold may be phased in, with companies issuing 15 per cent
of their shares initially, increasing this proportion to 20 per cent within
three years and 25 per cent by the end of five years.
As part of its policy of encouraging firms to go public, the government has
cut the rate of corporate tax on listed companies from the standard 35 per
cent to 24.5 per cent. There are matching incentives for investors.
Dividends paid by listed companies are not taxable in the hands of Mauritian
shareholders, while 30 per cent of the cash invested in new share issues is
tax-deductible over three years up to a maximum of MRs75,000.
Capital gains are treated generously, too, and the first MRs250,000 received
from the sale of listed securities is tax-free. In the light of such
incentives it is hardly surprising that both companies and investors should
have responded enthusiastically.
After a slow start in 1991-92 when only MRs108m was raised in new and rights
issues, the market took off, raising MRs1.7bn in cash calls in 1992-93 and
MRs141m in the year to June 1994.
Much now depends on how foreign investors respond. If emerging market
experience elsewhere in Africa is any guide, when foreigners take the
plunge, they will zero in on blue chip stocks, whose price-earnings
multiples are already looking high enough (Sun Resorts with 25 and Rogers
with 23), exacerbating the already-severe shortage of good quality scrip.
New issues, especially the large privatisation offers, will relieve some
buying pressure, but the signs are that the market will continue to advance,
albeit less spectacularly than in the past year.
