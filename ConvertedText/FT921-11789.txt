FT  30 JAN 92 / Letter: No plantation closure in Assam


   From Mr P MAGOR


Sir, In your survey on Kenya (January 8) Mr Julian Ozanne was wholly
inaccurate in stating that plantations had been closed in Assam. In fact,
great credit is due to the planting community in Assam, which continued
normal estate operations and the despatch of teas despite the pressures of
extortion, kidnapping and killings. On one occasion these pressures
culminated in the cold-blooded murder of an estate manager.
It would be quite wrong to portray Kenya as benefiting from the problems in
Assam.
