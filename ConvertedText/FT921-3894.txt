FT  12 MAR 92 / BTR cuts staff at Hawker Siddeley


   By ANDREW BOLGER


BTR, the UK industrial conglomerate, has started to cut significantly the
workforce of Hawker Siddeley, the British engineering group which it won in
a Pounds 1.55bn takeover last November.
Hawker employed 42,000 at the time of the takeover, in 100 operating units,
and BTR said yesterday it would ultimately reduce the workforce by between
10 and 15 per cent in view of the drop in demand caused by recession.
However, BTR is bullish about the prospects for Hawker and remains confident
that the purchase will not dilute its earnings this year.
Mr Alan Jackson, chief executive, said: 'Hawker really does look a very good
acquisition. Some of these businesses are very good and have exceeded our
expectations.'
BTR reported a 3 per cent drop in pre-tax profits to Pounds 917m in the year
to December 31 on flat sales of Pounds 6.74bn. It said the results confirmed
the group's resilience through the worst world economic conditions for
almost half a century. BTR shares closed 13p lower at 386p.
Earnings per share rose 2.3 per cent to 31.5p from 30.8p, mainly because a
41 per cent drop in net profits from BTR Nylex, its Australian subsidiary,
reduced the payment to minority interests from Pounds 154m to Pounds 100m.
The Hawker acquisition helped push up group gearing from 41 per cent to 89
per cent at the year end, with a total goodwill write-off of Pounds 1.2bn on
acquisitions. Mr Jackson said this was expected, but reducing indebtedness
would be the group's priority this year.
BTR said the gearing figure should be viewed against its strong trading cash
flow generation of Pounds 1bn last year and interest cover of 8.3 times.
Mr Jackson will make some disposals this year, but BTR is now thinking of
holding on to more than the 80 per cent of Hawker which it intended to keep
during the bid.
The group said it had responded to the second year of recession in most of
its major markets by taking vigorous action to reduce costs.
Efficiency savings had added about Pounds 70m to profits. However, these had
not been sufficient to offset the effects of real volume declines in most
markets and the costs of rationalisations and redundancies of Pounds 56m (up
from Pounds 31m), charged to trading results.
A final dividend of 9p compared with 8.75p gives a total for the year of
16.5p against 15.75p, an increase of 4.8 per cent. Dividend cover by
earnings drops from 2 to 1.9 times.
