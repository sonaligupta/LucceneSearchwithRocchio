FT  21 OCT 94 / International Company News: Lockheed, Martin Marietta lift
profits ahead of merger


   By TONY JACKSON


   NEW YORK


Lockheed and Martin Marietta, the two US defence companies which are due to
merge early next year, both succeeded in raising profits in the third
quarter in spite of flat or falling sales.
Martin Marietta's net earnings rose 14 per cent to Dollars 149m, Lockheed's
by 4 per cent - excluding one-off items - to Dollars 112m.
Lockheed's sales were 9 per cent down at Dollars 3.16bn. The company said in
the first nine months of the year, 66 per cent of sales were to the US
Department of Defence, while other US government sales took another 9 per
cent.
Numbers employed had fallen by 10,500, or 12 per cent, over the past year.
Martin Marietta's sales were up 4 per cent, or Dollars 96m, to Dollars
2.56bn. However, this year included a contribution from the space business
of General Dynamics, acquired last year.
At the time of acquisition, this business had sales of about Dollars 500m in
a full year.
Martin Marietta said its higher profits were due to the earlier merger with
GE Aerospace.
Similar benefits were coming through from the General Dynamics deal, it
said.
The merger between the two companies, announced at the end of August, has
the similar aim of combating the decline in defence orders. The combined
company will have annual sales of Dollars 23bn.
In New York, Lockheed shares closed down Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 69 7/8,
while Martin Marietta fell Dollars 1 to Dollars 44 1/2.
