FT  20 JUL 94 / International Company News: Smith Barney drops 45% from
previous quarter


   By RICHARD WATERS


   WASHINGTON


Smith Barney, the securities company owned by Travelers, the US financial
services group, posted a 45 per cent fall in earnings in the three months to
the end of June compared with the previous quarter.
The company blamed the fall on lower trading volumes and difficult financial
markets, echoing other financial firms which have reported figures in recent
days.
Smith Barney's net income of Dollars 79m, on revenues of Dollars 1.28bn,
compared with Dollars 144m, on revenues of Dollars 1.45bn, in the previous
period.
Comparisons with a year ago are not relevant since Smith Barney absorbed the
retail broking business of Shearson Lehman in the second half of last year.
The profit decline, which left Smith Barney with return on equity of 14.2
per cent for the period, was behind a fall in profits at Travelers compared
with the previous period.
The financial services group, which changed its name from Primerica after
acquiring the Travelers insurance company at the start of this year,
reported net income of Dollars 320m, or 93 cents a share, and six-month net
income of Dollars 660m, or Dollars 1.89.
Net income at most of Travelers' businesses equalled or exceeded the
previous period, with consumer finance contributing Dollars 55m, Primerica
Financial Services Dollars 52m, the Travelers life and annuities business
Dollars 50m, managed care and employee benefits Dollars 34m, and
property-casualty insurance Dollars 80m.
