FT  27 JUL 92 / Israel bank warns on loans guarantee waste


   By HUGH CARNEGY

ISRAEL'S central bank yesterday warned the government not to waste on
current spending Dollars 10bn in US loan guarantees it now expects to
secure. It said they must be used to finance productive investment which
would ensure the loans can be repaid, listing the country's heavy defence
spending among expenditures that must be reviewed.
Mr Jacob Frenkel, the governor of the Bank of Israel, told a cabinet meeting
that winning the loan guarantees, sought to help finance the absorption of
mass immigration from the former Soviet Union, would increase confidence and
investment in an economy burdened by sluggish growth and high unemployment.
The new Labour-led coalition aims to use the guarantees to underwrite a big
foreign borrowing programme that is a cornerstone of its recovery plans. It
is confident they will be released following the government's move to curb
Jewish settlements in the occupied territories, in keeping with US
conditions for the aid.
Mr Frenkel told ministers the guarantees must be used to support business
policies that would produce sustainable growth. He said the government must
accelerate investment in infrastructure, education and training, reduce
corporate taxation and speed reforms such as privatisation.
