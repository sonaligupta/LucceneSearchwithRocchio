FT  20 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading


   By JOEL KIBAZO


Dealers in the derivatives reported a lacklustre session that brought poor
turnover as the market waited for details of the UK gilts auction and
today's testimony from the chairman of the US Federal Reserve, writes Joel
Kibazo.
There was a firm start to trading in the September contract on the FT-SE 100
which opened at 3,106 on continued support from Monday. The CBI's positive
report on retail sales provided a further spur over the next couple of hours
before the decline in bonds brought about mid-morning profit-taking.
Having fallen to a low of 3,075, September rallied on the back of a recovery
in bonds, and the firm opening on Wall Street saw it advance further.
However, dealers reported a marked lack of activity in the market,
attributed in the main to uncertainty ahead of Mr Greenspan's speech and
some nervousness about the impending gilts auction.
September ended at 3,098, the same level as its previous close, and around 4
points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 6 points.
Volume came to 11,170 lots.
Traded options were quiet and volume fell to 25,337 contracts from Monday's
32,291. Turnover in the FT-SE 100 option was particularly poor at a mere
6,349 lots, and only 1,828 contracts were dealt in the Euro FT-SE option.
