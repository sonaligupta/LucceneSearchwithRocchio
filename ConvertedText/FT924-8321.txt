FT  11 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Late buying by trusts
lifts Nikkei off the day's low


   By EMIKO TERAZONO


   TOKYO


SHARE PRICES failed to react to the Ministry of Finance's plans to encourage
individual investors back into the stock market, and the Nikkei average
closed only marginally higher on late buying by investment trusts, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei gained 20.06 at 16,437.11. It rose to the day's high of 16,518.46
in the morning on the Finance Ministry's decision to ease regulations on
employees holding shares in their own company and to introduce a
savings-type cumulative stock investment system. However, interest failed to
last and the index fell to an afternoon low of 16,347.34 on profit-taking
and futures-related selling.
Volume picked up to 210m shares from 185m. The Topix index of all first
section stocks put on 5.60 at 1,255.06, but falls still led rises by 492 to
392 at the close, with 174 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50
index eased 1.98 to 1,010.84.
Tokkin, or specified money trusts, and individuals sold stocks in the
afternoon. However, activity remained thin on rumours that the Ministry of
Finance was keeping a check on large-lot selling.
Traders expressed worries over possible selling by foreign investors, able
to resist pressure from Japanese financial authorities to prevent investors
from selling stocks. 'European investors are looking to take profits on
holdings,' said one trader.
Banks were higher on last-minute buying. Industrial Bank of Japan gained Y40
to Y2,410 and Sakura Bank advanced Y30 to Y1,130.
High-technology exporters rose as the yen eased against the dollar. NEC
added Y9 at Y657 and Fujitsu Y8 at Y518. But Casio Computer fell Y19 to Y956
on news that the company now expected an 8 per cent fall in pre-tax profits
for the current year, against a previous forecast of an increase.
Reports of a 35 per cent fall in machine tool orders in September depressed
machine tool makers. Toshiba Machine dipped Y4 to Y486. Mori Seiki lost Y20
to Y1,440 on selling by institutional and foreign investors, discouraged by
Mori Seiki's forecast of a 96 per cent drop in annual pre-tax profits.
In Osaka, the OSE average shed 35.51 to 17,892.43 in volume of 11.1m shares.
Nintendo, the video game maker, declined Y80 to Y9,760 on reports that it
had indefinitely postponed sales of its CD-ROM game machine, currently under
development with Sony.
Roundup
PACIFIC Rim markets reacted to domestic influences. Bombay was closed for a
holiday.
AUSTRALIA fell on weaker commodity prices and a run on transport group TNT.
The All Ordinaries index dropped below its support level of 1,400, to
1,389.5, before steadying to close at 1,397.6, down 21.9 in turnover of
ADollars 244.1m.
TNT, whose ADollars 65m first-quarter loss disappointed analysts, plummeted
22 cents, or 30 per cent, to an all-time low of 53 cents in heavy volume of
4m shares. The fall in TNT and worries about GPA in the UK upset News Corp,
joint owner with TNT of the aviation leasing group AWAS, and the stock fell
90 cents to ADollars 26.40.
SEOUL ran into heavy profit-taking following its five-day rally. The
composite index finished 9.95 down at 676.86, but was clear of the day's low
of 669.10. A total of 71.3m shares changed hands, breaking Monday's record
of 71.1m.
Brokers said worries that the Bank of Korea would try to siphon off cash in
circulation, because of the influx of overseas money into the bourse,
sparked the correction.
BANGKOK's small banks led the retreat for the second day on talk of
stepped-up market surveillance to curb excessive speculation. The SET index
shed 12.84 to 926.52 in turnover of Bt15bn, making a two-day drop of 3.4 per
cent.
SINGAPORE firmed on brisk buying led by individual bargain hunters and
another round of institutional demand. Trading again concentrated on OTC
Malaysian shares, led by the Kamunting and Renong groups. The Straits Times
Industrial index rose 22.26 to 1,438.14 in volume of 277.1m shares, after
Monday's record 348.8m.
KUALA LUMPUR was broadly weaker in active trading as profit-taking
continued. The composite index ended down 3.61 at 645.32 in turnover of
MDollars 641m, but well below the previous day's record high of MDollars
916m.
HONG KONG closed slightly higher, with the Hang Seng index 5.17 up at
6,273.08 in low turnover of HKDollars 2.5bn.
The most active stock was Cheung Kong, unchanged at HKDollars 22.30,
followed by HSBC Holdings, also steady at HKDollars 66, and Hong Kong and
China Gas, down 20 cents at HKDollars 16.50.
TAIWAN ended mixed after early buying on hopes that the government would
adopt a package of market-boosting measures petered out. The weighted index
was finally just 4.39 ahead at 3,534.53. Turnover hit a three-year low of
TDollars 5.71bn.
MANILA's composite index dipped 8.49 to 1,337.17 as reports of rising
imports discouraged a market already depressed by an electric power crisis.
