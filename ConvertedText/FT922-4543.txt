FT  05 JUN 92 / Gaza turned into 'huge prison'


   By HUGH CARNEGY


   JERUSALEM


THE ARAB League yesterday accused Israel of having turned the impoverished
Gaza Strip into a 'huge prison' by sealing the narrow coastal territory for
11 days and cutting off its 750,000 Palestinian inhabitants from access to
work in Israel, their main source of income.
The closure, imposed after a Gazan had stabbed a 15-year-old Israeli
schoolgirl to death in a Tel Aviv suburb, has become bound up in the
campaign for the Israeli general election on June 23.
The ruling Likud party of Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the prime minister, is afraid
another stabbing might follow the end of the closure, provoke a repeat of
angry anti-Arab riots and draw criticism from the opposition Labour party.
Yesterday, a Palestinian was shot dead in Bethlehem, in the West Bank, after
stabbing and wounding an Israeli policeman.
