FT  03 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Refinancing package for Bredero's Centre
West project


   By DAVID BLACKWELL


CENTRE WEST, the ambitious Hammersmith office and retail development which
pushed Bredero Properties deeply into the red last year, has been refinanced
with Bayerische Hypotheken-und Wechsel Bank becoming the sole lender.
The project, began late in the construction boom because of long planning
delays, will be held by a ring-fenced Bredero subsidiary, Bredero Centre
West .
Bredero has been released from all financial liabilities to BCW which will
continue to manage completion of Centre West. BCW has 'a very limited
prospect of residual profit after satisfying all its obligations to Hypo,'
Bredero said.
Bredero, 49 per cent-owned by Slough Estates, is also prohibited from paying
any dividend to ordinary or preference shareholders until the end of
September next year.
Last month it announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 106.4m for 1992 and net
liabilities of Pounds 24.6m.
The group said yesterday that the restructured bank facilities would make 'a
significant improvement to the financial position'. Restating the 1992
balance sheet on a pro forma basis showed the group with net assets of
Pounds 4.8m.
Bredero would now concentrate on its interests in the Paisley Centre, the
Ashley Centre and the Hart Centre, and in the development sites at Centre
West phase 2 and the Buchanan Centre, Glasgow.
Hypobank is providing a new Pounds 70m loan facility to Centre West. The
bank acquired Pounds 74.7m of debt from the outgoing syndicate of 12 banks
for a consideration of Pounds 16.3m. As part of the refinancing, BCW's debt
has been written down by Pounds 58.4m. The bank said yesterday that it had
faith in the project, which was on time for its scheduled completion next
spring and was coming in under cost.
