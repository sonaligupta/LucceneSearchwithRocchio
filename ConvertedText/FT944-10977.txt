FT  08 NOV 94 / Survey of International Fund Management (3): Latin America
leads the way - Emerging markets / Analysis of the fall and the recovery
this year


   By JOHN PITT


A classic case of volatility has marked the performance of the world's
emerging markets during 1994, after a period of phenomenal, if not reckless,
growth during 1993.
The story of the markets so far this year has, more than ever, been
intertwined with the movement of US interest rates. In common with financial
markets everywhere, they suffered a sell-off in February as the US Federal
Reserve took the investment community by surprise by lifting interest rates.
However, the recovery during the third quarter has been almost as fast as
the fall in the first quarter with many of the markets now at or, in some
cases, even above levels at the start of the year.
According to the International Finance Corporation's index of emerging
market indices, the revival has been led by Latin America, while Europe's
emerging markets - Poland and Turkey in particular - have dragged their feet
following explosive growth in 1993.
Turkey's case history stands as an example of the risks attached to
investment in these markets. After a rise of more than 200 per cent in
dollar terms during 1993 the country's financial markets came under a wave
of selling as its foreign debt rating was downgraded in mid-January and the
Turkish lira collapsed against the dollar. This was soon accompanied by a
rise in inflation - into triple digit figures for the first time in 14 years
 -hitting an annual rate of 117 per cent in May. The market made a partial
recovery during the summer, as the government introduced an austerity
package, but at the end of the third quarter the market was still down 45
per cent in dollar terms on the year to date, according to IFC data.
The role of US institutional investors has been crucial this year in
determining the direction of emerging markets. According to NatWest Markets
in London US funds have the pivotal role in terms of international financial
flows, with US pension funds estimated to have assets in the region of
Dollars 3,500bn while mutual fund assets stand at around Dollars 2,000bn.
During 1993 US funds invested overseas generally and in emerging markets in
particular at an unprecedented rate: NatWest estimates that net new cash
sent abroad from the US doubled in 1993 - to some Dollars 270bn - but was
drastically cut back in the first few months of this year.
Mark Mobius, of Templeton Emerging Markets Fund, which has some Dollars 7bn
invested in this area, suggests that the prospects for the markets over the
next six months are generally good but have become 'more complex and
difficult to ascertain. While a number of markets have moved up
substantially and have recovered from the decline in the early part of the
year, many are overpriced. This, added to a great number of new issues
coming into the market at relatively high prices, could create problems of
excess liquidity in some of the markets'.
John Chew, of GT Management Asia based in Hong Kong, makes a distinction
between dollar block and non-dollar block emerging economies. Given the
unsettled state at the long end of US bonds, and the likelihood of further
rate rises there, he is negative on those countries closely tied to the US
dollar, which includes most of south-east Asia and much of Latin America. By
contrast, he is positive on, for instance, India, Pakistan, Korea and
Brazil.
He thinks Brazil - which is among the best performing of the world's
emerging markets so far this year - has a lot further to run following the
election of Fernando Henrique Cardoso as president in October, although, in
common with other analysts, he expects a sell-off during this quarter as
profits are taken and as negotiations on the budget get under way.
Latin America has certainly emerged as the favoured region for fund managers
in 1994. Barings Securities, which also compiles an index of emerging
markets, has the regional component up 20 per cent in dollar terms over the
year to date.
NatWest Markets estimates that 'the proportion of US funds heading into the
region rose to 77 per cent in the second quarter from 14.5 per cent in the
first three months of the year. A number of large Brady bond deals will
account for part of this abnormally large percentage, but the sheer scale of
the flows gives an indication of US investors' continued commitment to the
region'.
LatInvest, the Latin American securities house, notes that this year Latin
America has been perceived as a region to be a better hedge against rising
US interest rates than south-east Asia, partly based on the argument of its
greater dependence upon rising commodity prices.
However, they add, this has not been the only reason for the strong
performances seen in Peru and Chile, as well as Brazil, this year. 'The
markets are reflecting the benefits accruing to these countries of a
fundamental restructuring of the economy,' says LatInvest.
Of Peru, which has a market capitalisation of just Dollars 5bn compared to
Mexico's Dollars 200bn and Brazil's Dollars 100bn, James Capel's emerging
markets team, concurs, believing that the economy shows good growth
prospects helped by a revival in the mining sector which accounts for some 5
per cent of GDP.
Nevertheless, in common with Argentina, elections next year are likely to
act as a significant drag on performance in the short term.
Although the Asian region as a whole has been a laggard this year in terms
of performance, the third quarter saw a recovery from the low levels
experienced earlier in the year. India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka are favoured
among fund managers, based on economic strength and a more stable political
framework.
Of the three, India - with a market capitalisation of about Dollars 173bn -
has confirmed the promise for strong growth expressed by some fund managers
at the start of the year. This is illustrated by a 25 per cent gain in the
local index. Some analysts believe the index, currently at 4,300, could hit
5,000 by the year-end driven by improved company results and a good monsoon.
