FT  22 DEC 92 / International Company News: Pinault-Printemps director quits
after clash with chief


   By ALICE RAWSTHORN


MR JEAN-JACQUES Delort yesterday resigned as a director of
Pinault-Printemps, the French retailing and timber concern, after a row with
Mr Francois Pinault, chairman and the architect of last year's merger
between his timber company and the Printemps retailing group.
The Pinault group has for some time stirred interest because of its shift in
strategy when Mr Pinault changed direction away from the old
industrial-based interests of his family timber firm by expanding into
retailing. This culminated in the FFr5.3bn (Dollars 991m) partial bid for
Printemps.
The Printemps deal turned Pinault into a leading player in French retailing
with the Conforama furniture chain and La Redoute mail order catalogue as
well as the Printemps department stores.
It also left Pinault with heavy debts. Mr Pinault this autumn orchestrated a
FFr1bn capital increase from Credit Lyonnais, the French bank, and has
recently been reported to be negotiating to buy part of the bank's junk bond
portfolio.
Mr Pinault, renowned for his aggressive approach to business, is said to
have clashed with Mr Delort, a prominent figure in the French business
establishment and the former chairman of Printemps, over his plans for the
group. Pinault said in a statement yesterday that Mr Delort had resigned 'at
the request' of Mr Pinault.
After Mr Delort's departure Mr Pinault will replace him as president of the
administrative board of the group.
