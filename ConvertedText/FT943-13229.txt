FT  20 JUL 94 / Markets Report: Lira recovers ground


   By PHILIP GAWITH


The Italian government's decision yesterday to withdraw its controversial
detention decree helped the lira recover on foreign exchanges, writes Philip
Gawith.
Having spent a miserable Monday contemplating Italy's football world cup
defeat, and Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi doing the same to the currency,
traders had more to cheer about as the lira broke through the L1,000 barrier
against the D-Mark.
The Italian currency finished in London at L1,001, from L1,002 on Monday,
and later firmed to L999.
The dollar, meanwhile, continued its recent recovery ahead of the Humphrey
Hawkins testimony today of Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman.
The US currency closed in London at Y99.0250, from Y97.9050 on Monday.
Against the D-Mark it finished at DM1.5569 from DM1.5558. The yen ended
slightly firmer against the D-Mark at Y63.63 from Y63.75.
The sterling index finished at 79.5 from 79.3 as gains against the D-Mark,
on the back of a stronger dollar, outweighed losses against the US currency.
The pound closed in London at Dollars 1.5598 from Dollars 1.5586 and
DM2.4284 from DM2.4248.
The lira started trading in Europe at the L999 level, but then crashed
through L1,000 on rumours that Mr Roberto Maroni, the interior minister, had
resigned. The currency fell as low as L1,007 before news that the
controversial decree would be amended helped the currency recover above
L1,000.
Analysts agree that while the latest initiative has taken the heat out of
the situation, Italy is not out of the woods yet. Mr David Cocker, economist
at Chemical Bank in London, said: 'You still have major political
uncertainty in Italy as a result of Mr Berlusconi's faux pas. He really has
played this very badly.'
His views were echoed by IDEA, the financial markets consultancy, which
noted in its commentary: 'Even a compromise solution will leave the
government deeply shaken . . . its ability to implement tough reform and
deficit-cutting measures will be questionable. Bearing in mind the
difficulties faced even by a fully functional government in fiscal terms,
these developments paint a bleak picture for Italian assets in the medium
term, regardless of short-term announcement effects.'
The focus of attention for the dollar was the release of the May trade
figures. The market initially tried to sell the currency after the release
of the figures, which showed the deficit to be Dollars 9.17bn, against a
forecast Dollars 8.3bn deficit and April's Dollars 8.4bn deficit.
The sell-off, however, was soon reversed as the market took cheer from the
19.9 per cent drop in the trade gap with Japan, which fell to Dollars
4.39bn.
Traders reported that the rally was bolstered by market rumours of unrest in
North Korea, which led to some dollar buying.
Mr Cocker said the market was in a profit-taking phase, with the potential
to rise 3 to 4 pfennigs against the D-Mark. With the deficit improving and
Mr Fred Bergsten, the hitherto bearish economist changing his tune, Mr
Cocker commented: 'We do seem to be getting more voices speaking as one from
the US.'
He cautioned, however, that it was difficult to see this improved sentiment
lasting. July 31 is the deadline by which substantial progress must be shown
to have been made in US-Japan trade talks. If not, there is the prospect of
the US imposing sanctions against Japan, and this will most likely lead to
renewed dollar selling.
Mr Tony Norfield, treasury economist at ABN-Amro in London, said the dollar
had also gained support from the strength of US imports, which bolstered the
case of those arguing for an early tightening. But he pointed out that the
trend in US interest rates at the moment is, if anything, down.
In the futures market, for example, the December Eurodollar contract was
trading at 94.28, higher by 41 basis points than a week previously.
The dollar continued to firm after the London close, but analysts said trade
was thin. In New York it finished at Y99.225 and DM1.5685.
A slowdown in the rate of German M3 money supply growth in June, to an
annualised rate of 11.3 per cent, boosted hopes that the Bundesbank council
might decide to lower its official rates when it meets tomorrow.
On Monday Mr Otmar Issing, a Bundesbank board member, fuelled speculation
about the outlook for lower rates when he said he could not rule out that M3
would be back within its 4 to 6 per cent target range by the year-end.
German call money was steady at 4.85/4.90 per cent. The Bundesbank will
announce today the outcome of its latest repo auction, with rates expected
to fall by one to three basis points from 4.91 per cent.
In the UK the Bank of England provided money markets with Pounds 776m
assistance after declaring a shortage of Pounds 850m. In the futures market
the short sterling contracts were quiet, but Euromark contracts traded
positively on the M3 news, the December contract ending at 95.17 from 95.13.
