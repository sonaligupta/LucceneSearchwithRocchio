FT  30 JUN 93 / International Company News: Ferfin share price suffers
renewed battering


   By HAIG SIMONIAN


FERRUZZI Finanziaria (Ferfin), the debt-laden Italian group, and its
Montedison industrial subsidiary suffered a renewed battering on the Milan
stock market yesterday as trading resumed after Monday's one-day suspension.
Ferfin ordinary shares dipped 8.6 per cent to L498.5, while Montedison stock
slipped 8.62 per cent to L789 as speculation mounted about the causes of the
huge write-off announced by Montedison on Monday.
Ordinary shares in Ferfin have now plunged by more than 53 per cent since
the end of last month, when the group unveiled surprisingly large losses for
1992. Stock in Montedison has fallen slightly less sharply, with a drop of
30.2 per cent.
Further information about the write-off, which meant a revision of
Montedison's 1992 group losses to L1,679bn (Dollars 1.09bn) from L1,244bn,
may come at today's shareholders' meeting of Ferfin in Ravenna.
Official information about the increased loss has so far been limited to
terse comments by Mr Enrico Pizzi, a veteran board member. He said the loss
had stemmed from a 'credit, which has been revealed to be irrecoverable',
made by Financing and Investments NV.
The little-known company, based in Curacao and not listed in Montedison's
annual report, is a subsidiary of Montedison International Holding.
The scarcity of details has triggered speculation that the write-off could
be linked to illicit payments in the political corruption scandal.
Two members of the board of Montedison International Holding are involved in
financial operations linked to subsidiaries of Fiat and the big Eni state
energy and chemicals concern, both of which have been involved in kickbacks
to politicians.
Eni has admitted to using foreign subsidiaries for making illicit payments
to Italian politicians.
