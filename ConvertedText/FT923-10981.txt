FT  28 JUL 92 / World Trade News: S Africa 'dumping' inquiry


   By REUTER


   BRUSSELS


THE European Commission is investigating charges that South African
manganese steel wearparts are being dumped at unfairly low prices on the EC
market, Reuter reports from Brussels. The South African market share was
said to have reached 26 per cent in 1991. The share was higher in Britain
and France, the EC's two main producers of wearparts - manganese steel
castings used in machinery and liable to be worn away by the material
processed.
