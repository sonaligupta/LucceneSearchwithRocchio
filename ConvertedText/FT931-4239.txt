FT  11 MAR 93 / International Company News: Ashton Mining advances strongly
to ADollars 35.38m

ASHTON Mining, the Australian diamond and gold producer 46 per cent owned by
Malaysia Mining Corp, has posted record net profits of ADollars 35.38m
(USDollars 25)for 1992, up from ADollars 21.04m a year earlier, Reuter
reports from Melbourne.
Earnings per share rose to 12.65 cents from 7.50 cents and the final
dividend is set at 4 cents a share, making 8 cents for the year, up from 7
cents. Sales advanced to ADollars 287.10 from ADollars 250.63m.
Mr John Robinson, chief executive, said the diamond business was attracting
wide interest, primarily because of a large discovery in the Northwest
Territories of Canada last year by its joint venture with Broken Hill
Proprietary.
Diamonds accounted for 71 per cent of Ashton's 1992 sales compared with 100
per cent in 1987 when the group was starting to diversify into gold.
Mr Robinson said 1993 profits would depend on the level of diamond sales to
the Central Selling Organisation, the De Beers-controlled company.
