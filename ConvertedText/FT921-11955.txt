FT  29 JAN 92 / Third westerner may run east German state


   By QUENTIN PEEL


A WEST German candidate, Mr Bernhard Vogel, former prime minister of the
Rhineland Palatinate and close confidant of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, seems
certain to become the third western prime minister running a former east
German state in the federal republic, reports Quentin Peel.
The move by the dominant Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in the state of
Thuringia amounts to a calculated risk by the chancellor to bring his
eastern house into order.
The danger is that it will further infuriate east German opinion, already
bitter at the behaviour of westerners in enforcing the free market economy
on their collapsed socialist system.
The benefit is that it could provide new leadership to an eastern CDU, which
has so far failed to produce outstanding personalities and which is torn
between politicians tainted by co-operation with the former Communist
authorities, and angry young reformers without experience of office.
