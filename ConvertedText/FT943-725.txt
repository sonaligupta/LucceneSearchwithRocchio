FT  28 SEP 94 / Switch on student admission totals


Figures for university admissions produced yesterday contradict earlier
estimates that several thousand places would remain unfilled.
Universities are likely to admit slightly more students than they did last
year in spite of a 4 per cent fall in the number of 18-year-olds, the
university admissions service said.
The latest figures, produced as the university applications process reaches
its final week, suggest that the government's well-publicised attempt to cap
admissions at the same level as for 1993 has not depressed demand for higher
education.
The Universities and Colleges Admissions Service said 270,360 university
places had been taken up by Monday - compared with a published figure for
last year of 274,000.
In addition, Ucas said almost 5,000 applicants had definite offers of places
and had not yet told universities whether they had accepted, while between
11,000 and 12,000 late applicants were still awaiting decisions from
universities.
