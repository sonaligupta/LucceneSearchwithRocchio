FT  22 JUL 94 / International Company News: Saint-Louis in Spanish stake
talks

Saint-Louis, the French food and paper group, has begun negotiations to
double its stake in General Azucarera, the Spanish sugar company, from the
present level of 10 per cent, according to Mr Bernard Dumon, chairman.
Mr Dumon has confirmed that Saint-Louis was in talks to buy the holding in
General Azucarera owned by Banco Central Hispanoamericano, the banking
group. If the deal goes through the French group would emerge with just over
20 per cent of General Azucarera, which has annualised sales of FFr1.5bn
(Dollars 279m).
The General Azucarera deal forms part of Saint-Louis's plans to expand its
activities over the next few years. The French group, which made net profits
of FFr717m on sales of FFr34.16bn in 1993, is already a force in the
European sugar market through its Generale Sucriere subsidiary and in paper
due to its interest in Arjo Wiggins Appleton.
However, Mr Dumon said he hoped to double Saint-Louis's annual sales over
the next six years. He estimated that the group could currently afford to
spend between FFr7bn and FFr8bn on acquisitions, including FFr2.5bn in
surplus cash.
'It's highly likely that we will stage a significant acquisition as we have
in the past,' said Mr Dumon. 'But we must be patient.'
The proposed increase in the General Azucarera stake is seen as the first
stage in this expansion programme. Mr Dumon also envisaged establishing
Saint-Louis as a force in the eastern European sugar market with projects
already under way in the Czech Republic and Poland.
However, the chairman said that Saint-Louis might consider raising capital
by selling its stake in Danone, the French food group which recently changed
its name from BSN. Saint-Louis currently owns a 2.39 per cent holding in
Danone, which has a stock market value of FFr1.3bn.
