FT  12 NOV 92 / The Matrix Churchill Scandal: Legal position of three
cabinet ministers still in question


   By JOHN MASON


THE legal position of the three cabinet ministers who signed public interest
immunity (PII) certificates to prevent confidential government documents
being used as evidence in the Matrix Churchill trial was still being
questioned yesterday, John Mason writes.
This was despite the assurance by Sir Nicholas Lyell QC, the
attorney-general, on Tuesday that the ministers had a duty to try to stop
the documents being used in court.
Sir Nicholas told the Commons that when publication of official documents
was against the public interest, ministers had no discretion and had to ask
the courts for their publication to be prevented.
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, yesterday justified
his signing of the PII certificates by saying he had consulted the
attorney-general beforehand who gave him the same advice.
However, one leading QC with considerable experience of PII cases maintained
that ministers would always have some discretion. This would apply in
deciding whether publication would be against the public interest. 'That
initial value judgment always has to be made,' he said.
A leading criminal solicitor was concerned that in cases such as Matrix
Churchill such decisions about public interest would be taken in practice by
civil servants.
However, lawyers agreed that it was incorrect to suggest that PII could not
be used in criminal cases. In a recent Court of Appeal ruling, Lord Justice
Mann made it plain that it could and that it was for the trial judge to
balance the conflicting claims of interest.
