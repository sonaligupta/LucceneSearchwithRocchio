FT  11 NOV 92 / International Company News: Jaguar Cars to cut staff in US
by 10%


   By AGENCIES


JAGUAR Cars, owned by the Ford Motor Company, said yesterday it is cutting
its US staff by 10 per cent immediately, agencies report.
Jaguar said the move followed a 12-month review of the company structure,
after an intensive reorganisation in mid-1991. The luxury carmaker blamed
the cuts on the depressed car market, saying sales in the prestige sector
were not improving.
Ford Motor Company posted a Dollars 158.9m loss in the third quarter of
1992. Its European operations were dragged down by the Jaguar unit, which
posted a Dollars 100m operating loss in the three-month period.
Ford said it was continuing to wring costs out of Jaguar which it bought in
1990, but was having difficulty curtailing the operating loss due to the
continuing fall in car sales.
