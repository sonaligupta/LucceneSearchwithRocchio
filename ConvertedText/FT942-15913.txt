FT  13 APR 94 / 'Patchy recovery' north of border


Scotland is experiencing a patchy economic recovery, according to the latest
quarterly business survey by the Scottish chambers of commerce. The survey
shows that business confidence increased during the period, but more slowly
than during the previous quarter.
It also showed that manufacturing orders from the Scottish market continued
to rise while export orders grew at a slightly faster rate than in the
fourth quarter of last year.
