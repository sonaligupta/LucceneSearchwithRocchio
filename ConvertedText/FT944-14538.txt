FT  22 OCT 94 / First contract for Swans' rescuer


The company which has agreed to buy the Hebburn yard of Swan Hunter, the
Tyneside shipbuilder in receivership, has won its first ship repair contract
for the site before the purchase deal has been legally completed.
On Thursday, the day the Hebburn yard's sale to Tees Dockyard is due to be
completed, the Stena Well Servicer, an offshore oil and gas field support
vessel, will arrive for overhaul and refurbishment.
