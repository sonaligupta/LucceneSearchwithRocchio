Holderbank Financiere Glarus, the world's largest cement producer, has taken
a 51 per cent stake in Cimenterie de l'Oriental of Morocco for an

CIOR, which was up for sale as part of Morocco's privatisation programme,
has two cement plants in Oujda and Fes and a trans-shipment facility in
Casablanca.
'The Moroccan investment is part of Holderbank's geographic diversification
strategy and represents the beachhead for the group's expansion into the
Maghreb countries,' Holderbank said.
