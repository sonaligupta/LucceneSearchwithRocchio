FT  08 NOV 94 / Blair sets out to woo business


   By KEVIN BROWN


Mr Tony Blair will today set out plans for a working relationship between
business and a Labour government, based on partnership and a positive
approach to the European Union.
In an effort to reassure business that the party has dumped its 1970s
ideological baggage, the Labour leader will offer strong support for a
dynamic market economy in which the government's role is limited to support
for industry.
Mr Blair is expected to tell 200 senior executive members of the Per Cent
club, which organises charitable activity that it will require a new style
of government and a new relationship with industry.
He plans to say: 'New Labour will not return to the old style, corporatist,
Whitehall-knows-best attitudes. Our job is not to do the work of individual
companies but to create a government in which all sides of business work
together.'
Mr Blair will declare that the debate between privatisation and
nationalisation is over, and will rule out a return to the punitive taxation
rates imposed by the last Labour government.
He will also acknowledge the abandonment of Labour's one-time plans to
dismantle the framework of employment law established by the Conservatives
since 1979.
But Mr Blair will stress that Labour plans a programme of industrial and
economic change which will be more radical than the changes forced through
by Baroness Thatcher between 1979 and 1990.
He will say: 'Tory radicalism may be extinct now that Thatcherism is dead,
but Labour's radicalism is not. The idea that all radicalism is dead because
Thatcherism is dead is absurd.'
