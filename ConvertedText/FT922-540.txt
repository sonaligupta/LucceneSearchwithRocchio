FT  26 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow sheds early rise despite
rate cut hopes

Wall Street
ALTHOUGH the latest economic news had earlier raised investors' hopes of
another interest rate cut, US share prices ended slightly lower yesterday
amid continued concern about the outlook for the economy, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed a net 6.69 off at 3,284.01, a
substantial turnround from a 14-point rise achieved by mid-morning. The
Standard & Poor's 500 lost 0.71 at 403.12, while the Nasdaq composite index
dipped 3.19 to 548.20. Turnover on the New York SE came to 182m shares.
Equities received an early boost from news that initial claims for state
unemployment insurance rose by 16,000 in the week ended June 13. Analysts
had been expecting a modest decline in jobless claims, and the figure
increased the chances that the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates one
more time to boost economic activity.
The Commerce Department later announced an upward revision in first-quarter
gross domestic product, from an originally estimated 2.4 per cent growth to
2.7 per cent. Analysts, however, believe that second-quarter GDP growth will
come in well below first quarter levels, probably at under 2 per cent. The
realisation that economic growth is now slowing put share prices under
pressure during the afternoon.
Tobacco issues remained heavily traded in the wake of Wednesday's historic
ruling by the US Supreme Court allowing smokers to use state injury laws to
sue cigarette manufacturers. RJR Nabisco slipped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 8
7/8 and Philip Morris shed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 73 1/4 .
Delta Air Lines was down Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 53 3/4 in busy trading in
the wake of a Dollars 1bn issue of new convertible preferred stock priced on
Wednesday night at Dollars 50, with a 21.76 per cent conversion premium.
International Paper gained Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 69 3/8 on a
recommendation from broking house Bear Stearns. Emerson Radio rose Dollars
5/8 to Dollars 2 5/8 on news that the company had settled its litigation
with Fidenas Investment. The settlement means that Fidenas's nominees will
not be opposed by Emerson at its annual meeting in July.
On the Nasdaq market, Lotus Development plunged Dollars 5 3/8 to Dollars 18
3/8 in heavy turnover after the company warned that it expected to report
second-quarter earnings of between 30 and 40 cents a share, well below
analysts' expectations. Lotus blamed slower than expected spreadsheet sales
for the disappointing earnings.
T2 Medical dropped Dollars 5 to Dollars 21 1/2 after a grand jury,
investigating possible conflicts of interest among doctors who refer
patients to laboratory facilities in which the doctors have a financial
stake, requested certain documents from the company.
Canada
LATE declines in oil shares and technical weakness across the board brought
Toronto down from a modest midday gain. NYMEX August oil futures lost 31
cents to close at USDollars 22.58.
The TSE 300 index ended 1.1 off at 3,338.5 on balance, while falls led rises
by 282 to 246 after volume of 36.5m shares.
