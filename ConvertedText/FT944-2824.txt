FT  15 DEC 94 / International Company News: Chief of Hoechst's French arm
resigns


   By DANIEL GREEN


Evidence of some of the strains of restructuring at Hoechst, the German
chemicals company, emerged yesterday with the departure of Mr Ernst-Gunter
Afting, president of Roussel-Uclaf, the French company in which Hoechst has
a controlling stake.
Officially, Mr Afting left 'for personal reasons', but he is known to have
had personal and strategy differences for many months with Mr Karl Heinz
Seifert, Hoechst board member with responsibility for both the German
company's pharmaceuticals operations and Roussel-Uclaf.
Mr Afting is replaced at Roussel-Uclaf by Mr Jean Pierre Godard, head of
Hoechst's pharmaceuticals division. Mr Godard, a French national, was an
executive at Roussel-Uclaf before taking his current job at Hoechst's
Frankfurt headquarters.
Mr Afting is considering offers from other pharmaceutical companies, but has
made no decision yet about which to accept.
Hoechst appointed Mr Jurgen Dormann as chairman in May. He quickly embarked
on a restructuring programme which has seen the elimination of thousands of
jobs.
He wants change the group's philosophy from one of a centrally-controlled
bureaucracy to an organisation which delegates power to divisions.
