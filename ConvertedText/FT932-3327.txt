FT  15 JUN 93 / Commercial property values 'start to climb'


   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent


COMMERCIAL property values have stopped falling for the first time since
1989, statistics published yesterday show.
A report by Hillier Parker, the firm of chartered surveyors, provides the
first statistical evidence that the worst property recession for 50 years is
over.
The surveyors say average commercial property values, which fell 42 per cent
from their peak in 1989, have risen 0.2 per cent since May.
The greatest improvement was in the retail market, where values rose 0.8 per
cent, followed by the office sector, where values rose 0.1 per cent.
Industrial property continued to fall in value, with a decline of 0.6 per
cent.
The improvement in the market stems from a marked increase in demand from
investors, which has pushed down investment yields - the ratio of income to
capital values. This has more than compensated for the continued decline in
rental values, which also influence capital values. Rents are still falling,
but more slowly.
Hillier Parker says demand from investors in property is greater than at any
time in the past decade.
It calculates that at least Pounds 7bn has been earmarked for property
investment. It has identified 22 pension funds and 29 insurance companies
which plan to spend a total of Pounds 4bn on property. It believes also that
11 property companies want to spend Pounds 1.9bn and 83 overseas investors
Pounds 1.4bn.
Signs of recovery have reached even the most depressed parts of the market,
including central London offices, the firm says. Office yields showed the
most marked improvement over the past month, falling from 9.3 per cent to
9.1 per cent. In August 1989 they reached a low of 6.8 per cent.
Demand is still centred on good-quality, well-let property, which accounts
for about a quarter of the market, it says.
