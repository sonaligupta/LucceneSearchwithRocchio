FT  01 DEC 94 / Mortgage lenders' guidelines near


Voluntary guidelines for mortgage lenders should come a step closer next
week with the publication of a proposed code from the British Bankers'

The association's guidelines will be published with a leaflet intended to
make sure that customers know what questions they should ask when deciding
about home loans.
