FT  28 JUL 92 / Interest in Land Travel database


   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent


AROUND 20 companies have expressed an interest in buying the customer
database of Land Travel, the Bath-based coach operator which collapsed last
week.
Mr Robert Buller of liquidator Grant Thornton said yesterday that most of
the potential purchasers were travel companies experiencing a difficult
season.
Sale of the database would not provide funds to compensate the estimated
50,000 people who booked holidays with Land Travel or the 2,500 who had
their holidays cut short, he said.
Land Travel was neither a member of the Association of British Travel Agents
(Abta) nor the Bus and Coach Council and was not part of any money-back
scheme.
Any funds obtained from the sale would go towards paying the cost of the
liquidation, Mr Buller said. A single letter to each of the company's
creditors inviting them to a meeting would be likely to cost about Pounds
15,000, he said.
There was little prospect of any buyer wanting to purchase the company
itself, he added.
Mr Nigel Griffith, Labour's consumer affairs spokesman, said the government
should consider paying compensation to Land Travel customers who had lost
money in the collapse.
Mr Griffiths said: 'For the past eight weeks it has been the talk of the
travel trade that this company was in trouble and there are various factors
which gave rise to that belief.
'If the Department of Trade and Industry knew about these things and were
dilatory or negligent in acting on them, then the government must consider
compensating those who have fallen foul of this collapse.'
