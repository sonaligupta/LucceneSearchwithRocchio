FT  27 JAN 94 / UK gilts auction disappoints


   By ANTONIA SHARPE


The Bank of England's first 1994 auction of government bonds received a
lukewarm reception yesterday. The auction of 6 1/4 per cent Treasury stock
due 2010 raised Pounds 2.75bn and the average accepted price was Pounds
98.20 for a yield of 6.38 per cent.
The cover, or the amount by which demand exceeds supply, was 1.21 times,
below market expectations of 1.5 times. This compares with cover of 2.19 for
the December auction, but remains above 1993-94's lowest level of 1.1.
Another sign of subdued investor interest was the 'tail', the difference
between the average accepted price and the lowest. It was two basis points
compared with expectations of one basis point or less.
Although long-dated gilt prices fell by as much as  5/8 point, analysts were
relaxed about the disappointing level of investor interest. 'The
below-average cover and the above-average tail in today's auction is no
barrier to performance in the weeks ahead,' said Mr Simon Briscoe, a gilts
analyst at SG Warburg.
He also noted that the sum raised yesterday brought gilt issuance for the
year to about Pounds 48bn, compared with an estimated funding requirement of
Pounds 49bn. This meant that the Bank of England was well ahead of schedule
with its programme and that it could be over-funded by as much as Pounds 5bn
going into the 1994-95.
Mr Nigel Richardson, head of bond research at Yamaichi International, said
that the good long-term outlook for inflation in the UK was likely to
support the market.
Other analysts were confident that the market would soon recover its poise
in the widespread belief that much of yesterday's paper had gone into the
long-term investment portfolios of domestic institutions.
