FT  30 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Brent Walker pays Pounds 240,000
compensation


Directors who left Brent Walker, the pubs, betting shops and property group,
during 1992 received compensation of Pounds 240,000 for loss of office.
During the year Lord Kindersley, the chairman, resigned. The compensation
did not include payments to Mr Ken Scobie, who resigned as chief executive
in January this year, or Mrs Jean Walker, wife of former chairman Mr George
Walker, whose compensation was fixed after the year-end. Those payments
together are expected to exceed Pounds 1m.
The accounts show the highest paid director received Pounds 638,000 during
1992. This was Mr John Brown, head of the betting shop division, who was
entitled to a bonus of Pounds 467,000 relating to Rapid Raceline, a business
he set up and sold to William Hill.
