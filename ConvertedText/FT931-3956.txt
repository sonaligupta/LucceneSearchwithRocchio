FT  12 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Hungary pressed to devalue


   By NICHOLAS DENTON


   BUDAPEST


REPORTS that Hungary's exports plummeted in the first two months of the year
are fuelling pressure on the Budapest government for a devaluation of the
currency.
The Hungarian international economic relations ministry conceded yesterday
that, in January and February, there had been a considerable fall in
deliveries from the levels reached a year earlier.
Officials denied press reports that the decline was as high as 40 per cent.
Even so, the latest reports are given some credibility by more solid figures
showing that current account performance deteriorated sharply in the last
quarter of 1992.
Such leading exporters as Tungsram, the General Electric lighting subsidiary
which suffered a record Ft9bn (Pounds 72m) loss in 1992, are also pressing
for exchange rate adjustment.
But the central bank moved yesterday to quash speculation about a
devaluation. 'Exports are weak but to go from that to an exchange rate
conclusion is a long way,' said Mr Imre Tarafas, deputy president of the
National Bank of Hungary.
The bank has consistently revalued the currency in real terms to maintain
downward pressure on inflation since the country began its economic
stabilisation programme.
