FT  26 MAY 93 / International Company News: Hermes to offer 4% of shares to
public


   By ALICE RAWSTHORN


HERMES, one of France's most famous luxury goods groups, yesterday finalised
plans to go public by floating 4 per cent of its shares on the Paris second
market at FFr300 each.
The flotation, which values the group at FFr3.2bn (Dollars 580m), will
involve the sale of 425,000 shares. The founding family's stake in Hermes,
best-known for its silk scarves and classic Kelly bags, will fall from 90
per cent to 81.4 per cent.
Hermes was founded in the 1830s in Paris as a manufacturer of horse
harnesses. The business has been run by the Hermes family since, but was
given a new lease of life under the management of Mr Jean-Louis Dumas in the
flourishing luxury goods market of the 1980s.
The luxury business has since slowed down, reflecting the economic pressures
of recession.
Hermes has emerged unscathed, mainly due to its skill at emphasising its
classic styles and hand craftsmanship. It saw net profits rise from FFr121m
in 1991 to FFr176m, on sales of FFr2.46bn, in 1992 and anticipates a modest
increase to FFr180m for 1993.
