FT  03 SEP 93 / International Company News: Pfizer's shares surge as valve
claims are settled


   By KAREN ZAGOR


PFIZER, the big US pharma-ceutical company, yesterday said it had settled
the bulk of lawsuits involving its Shiley heart valve.
Pfizer would not reveal the terms of the settlement but said it would have
no material adverse effect on its finances. The news helped lift shares in
Pfizer Dollars 2 to Dollars 64 3/4 on Wall Street by the close.
Mr Paul Miller, Pfizer's general counsel, said: 'We continue to believe
there is no basis for people with functioning valves to recover damages, but
the company wants to put this time-consuming and costly litigation behind it
and to focus on more productive activities.'
Pfizer has been involved with Shiley litigation for many years. While the
company has never admitted that the valve is defective, about 400 recipients
of the artificial heart valve have died or suffered from its fracture. It
was taken off the world market in 1986.
In 1992, the company forwarded a plan to resolve disputes in a Cincinnati
court which included a Dollars 215m class action settlement plus Dollars
300m in reserves for fracture claims. Earlier this year, a California
appeals court upheld a ruling allowing non-California residents to file
Shiley-related lawsuits in the state.
