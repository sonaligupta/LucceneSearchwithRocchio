FT  28 JAN 94 / Reformers urge Yeltsin to resist policy switch


   By LEYLA BOULTON

President Boris Yeltsin's supporters have told him he is courting disaster
at the next elections if he endorses the government's change in economic
policy and fails to crack down on organised crime.
Mr Sergei Yushenkov, a leader of Russia's Choice, the electoral bloc which
includes some of the president's oldest supporters, said Mr Viktor
Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, would 'try to curb economic reform and his
latest steps prove it'.
Amid reports that Mr Chernomyrdin has already ordered more state credits for
ailing enterprises, Mr Yushenkov called for his dismissal.
'We hope the president will at last realise the danger of curbing economic
reforms and take the necessary decisions.'
Mr Yeltsin's spokesman, Mr Vyacheslav Kostikov, hedged his bets on how Mr
Yeltsin would respond to the warnings. 'The president did not expect such a
bitter reaction from the democratic wing of society,' he said.
Although he admitted that some of Mr Chernomyrdin's statements had been a
cause for concern, he said Mr Yeltsin would watch how the new government
behaved in practice.'
The president was also advised yesterday by Mr Pyotr Filippov, one of his
senior aides, to create special security forces to fight Russia's mafia.
Otherwise extremists like Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky might win presidential
elections in 1996 by promising draconian measures to fight a breakdown in
law and order.
Meanwhile, on a two-day visit to Rome, Mr Chernomyrdin, was quoted as vowing
to keep his country on a reformist course.
He told Italian Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi he hoped Russia would be
admitted to the Group of Seven industrialised nations this year, and that
his country aimed to work towards full membership of the European Union.
