FT  16 MAR 94 / Survey of Information and Communications Technology (1): The
shape of things to come


Floating down a Venetian canal or walking under the arched ceilings of a
medieval cathedral could all happen in the not-too-distant future without
the traveller leaving the armchair - see picture, right.
By holding a spaceball - that replaces the remote control pad - the armchair
traveller can explore the world through a virtual reality interface and
enhanced three-dimensional-type pictures on the home TV. This futuristic
tourism is just one of the TV-based home services being developed by BT
Laboratories at Martlesham Heath, near Ipswich in Suffolk.
Known as VRHS (for virtual reality home services), engineers are working on
a range of intuitive interfaces that could transform the way that TV is
viewed.
