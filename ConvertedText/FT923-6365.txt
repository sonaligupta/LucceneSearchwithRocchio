FT  25 AUG 92 / Letter: Quality scheme is necessity not luxury


   From Mr JOHN LANE


Sir, Diane Summers' ('Small businesses criticise quality scheme', August 21)
exposes the soft underbelly of British industry. The attitude that 'we
cannot afford to implement a quality scheme' displays negative thinking.
The correct attitude for any forward looking management should be 'we cannot
afford not to implement a quality scheme'.
The success of any quality scheme depends on senior managements' embracing
the concept of quality and creating a culture within their organisations
with which all employees identify.
A formal quality scheme, regularly reviewed to keep pace with changes in the
business, is simply the vehicle which allows the company to move towards
achieving its quality objectives, whether accredited to BS5750 or not.
Instead of concentrating on calculating the cost of establishing a quality
scheme, these managers should also calculate the cost of poor quality to
their businesses.
When the advantages that can accrue from a quality scheme are explained,
together with the effect on the bottom line, negative thinkers may undergo a
conversion.
