FT  19 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading


   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY


Arbitrageurs enjoyed huge scope for manoeuvre yesterday in equity
derivatives with the June FT-SE 100 contract flinging itself from strength
to frailty, Christine Buckley writes.
The contract began confidently as markets focused on hopes for a UK interest
rate cut but was pushed into a tail spin by the US Fed's hike in interest
rates which came just over an hour before trading on Liffe closed.
Relatively low volume pumped up volatility with sellers swinging the market
more than they would have done in a more liquid state. At one stage, quotes
on the contract were moving so rapidly a fast market was declared - meaning
that trading can continue but that quoted prices are not firm. In such rare
periods the exchange does not operate its usual responsibility via the
clearing house.
The contract moved through nearly 60 points after climbing to an intraday
high of 3,191 early in the session to languishing around the 3,132 mark just
before close and at a discount to the cash market of several points. It
edged up to 3,138 at the official close with a little over 12,000 contracts
traded.
Hanson dominated the stock options with James Capel behind the 8,118 lots
traded. The broker bought 4,000 May puts and sold November 260 puts to roll
over its position.
