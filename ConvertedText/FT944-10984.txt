FT  08 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: Komercni Banka sets east
European benchmark


   By VINCENT BOLAND


   PRAGUE


Komercn Banka, the second biggest bank in the Czech Republic in asset terms,
is to raise Dollars 65m in the international syndicated loan market at a
margin of 65 basis points over Libor, the narrowest spread yet for an
eastern European borrower.
Last month another Czech bank, Ceskoslovenska Obchodn Banka (CSOB), the
Czech and Slovak trade bank, set a new benchmark for such borrowers by
raising Dollars 75m in a five-year loan at 70bp over Libor. CSOB had set the
issue at Dollars 50m but strong demand pushed subscriptions to Dollars 120m
before being scaled back.
Sumitomo Bank, arranger and agent for Komercn Banka, said fees for the
five-year loan would range from 25bp to 30bp. Sumitomo also arranged the
CSOB loan. Full details of the new issue will be announced in London this
morning.
The terms of the loan are likely to set another benchmark for Czech
borrowers. It will be closely watched by other banks and corporates seeking
to raise funds abroad, according to bankers in Prague.
Several issues are being considered and the reaction to such a narrow spread
for the Komercn Banka loan among prospective lenders will determine if
margins fall further.
Komercn Banka said it would use the funds raised by the loan to provide
export financing to customers.
