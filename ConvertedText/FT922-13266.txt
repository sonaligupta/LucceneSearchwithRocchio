FT  13 APR 92 / Foreign Exchanges and Money Markets: To cut or not to cut


   By EMMA TUCKER


WITH STERLING still riding high from last week's shock Conservative victory,
debate this week in the markets will doubtless continue to focus on the
chances for a cut in UK base rates, Emma Tucker writes.
In the heat of the election's aftermath let it not, after all, be forgotten
that Britain is still struggling to come out of a deep recession and a cut
in the cost of borrowing would help beleaguered businesses invest for future
growth.
Key economic data out this week may well be disappointing. Although
manufacturing output and imports should show signs of recovery, M4 lending
and retail sales may not.
But with a five year mandate secured, the political pressure to cut base
rates has been lifted off the shoulders of the Conservative government, and
they may decide to wait for the pound to strengthen before they even
consider a further reduction.
According to Mr Chris Dillow at Nomura Research Institute, views on sterling
divide into two camps - those who expect an early base rate cut and those
who expect the Conservatives to fulfil their promise to take sterling into
the narrow band of the ERM at a central rate of DM2.95.
'The former camp are likely to be disappointed,' says Mr Dillow. 'With
German interest rates unlikely to fall until next year, the effective floor
for UK rates will remain high. In this context, cuts in rates by Japan and
the US would not help UK rates down. Indeed, quite the opposite, if they
weaken sterling against the DM.'
Another important factor determining the government's behaviour should be
the memory factor. Mr Nigel Lawson, the then chancellor, eased policy after
the general election in 1987, to, eventually, disastrous effect.
