FT  01 DEC 94 / Papandreou will not run


   By KERIN HOPE


   ATHENS


Greek prime minister Mr Andreas Papandreou has said he will not run for the
presidency next spring. The ruling Panhellenic Socialist Movement must now
find an alternative candidate. Parliament is due to vote for a new head of
state by May when President Constantine Karamanlis, 87, is due to step down.
But Pasok will be forced into an early general election unless it can find
another 10 votes from other parties to reach the 180 needed to elect a
president. The Socialists, together with a progressive faction in the
centre-right opposition New Democracy party are keen to avoid derailing
Greece's economic stabilisation programme by holding a fresh election. Names
being floated of compromise candidates for president include Mr Christos
Lambrakis, who runs Greece's leading media group, and Mr Odysseus Elytis, a
Nobel prize-wining poet.
