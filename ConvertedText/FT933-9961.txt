FT  06 AUG 93 / Barclays recovers as headhunting goes on


   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor


BARCLAYS, the UK's biggest bank, yesterday returned to profits helped by a
strong performance from its core banking division. Its interim pre-tax
profit of Pounds 335m compared with Pounds 51m in the first half of last
year and a full-year loss of Pounds 242m.
Provisons for bad debts fell Pounds 51m, but still stood at Pounds 997m.
The bank cut its interim dividend from 9.15p to 6.5p to 'rebalance' it after
the halving of last year's final to 6p.
Mr Andrew Buxton, chairman, said Barclays was 'at an advanced' stage in its
search for a new chief executive, from outside, to split his roles. The
search started in March after pressure from investors.
'We have had some very high quality candidates, so there is no truth in the
rumour that we have found it difficult to find candidates,' said Mr Buxton.
The results were affected by an unexpected Pounds 275m provision for
troubled businesses in the US. The bank has created a United States
Transition business holding Pounds 4.3bn of assets including poor property
loans, its US mortgage processing business, and a portfolio of inadequately
priced loans.
The BZW investment banking division made a Pounds 234m profit, against
Pounds 118m. Foreign exchange trading made gross profits before staff and
other costs of Pounds 137m, against Pounds 105m, and other dealing income
rose from Pounds 79m to Pounds 247m.
The bank retained earnings of Pounds 84m, against a deficit of Pounds 206m.
This was the first time since the first half of 1991 that Barclays has
managed to retain earnings.
