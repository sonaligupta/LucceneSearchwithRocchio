FT  28 JAN 94 / Pounds 135m spent on scrapped rail link


British Rail has spent up to Pounds 135m on parts of the Channel tunnel
high-speed rail link that will not now go ahead, Mr Roger Freeman, public
transport minister, said last night.
Mr Freeman, in a Commons written answer, said BR had spent Pounds 89m on an
abandoned section of the link's southerly route. The government announced
last week that the route through London would be north of the Thames to a
terminal at St Pancras.
Mr Freeman said Union Railways, the company promoting the high-speed tunnel
link, had also 'assigned' Pounds 46m to the plan, now dropped, to site a
terminal at King's Cross.
'A more detailed assessment is not possible because the King's Cross project
was not conceived solely for the rail link,' Mr Freeman said. 'A proportion
of the southerly approach is still part of the route.'
Much of the money spent on the southern link went towards buying property,
particularly a large swathe in Peckham, south London, and most of the
village of South Darenth in Kent. 'It remains to be seen what additional
reduction in net cost will be achieved through further property sales,' Mr
Freeman said.
