FT  07 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Black Sea port project gets backing from
Bula


Bula Resources (Holdings), the energy production and exploration group, has
signed a letter of intent with the Krasnodar region of the Russian
Federation in respect of development and finance required for enhancement of
the Black Sea port of Tuapse.
In return, Bula will receive a royalty based on tonnage flow through the
port; an absolute priority right to have products exported or imported
through the port, and a right of first refusal on any opportunities that may
become available regarding exploitation of oil and gas assets in the
Krasnodar region.
Mr Jim Stanley, chairman, said the move signalled Bula's commitment to
Russia.
