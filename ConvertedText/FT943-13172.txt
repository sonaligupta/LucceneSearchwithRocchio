FT  21 JUL 94 / International Company News: Production delays depress Lotus
results

Lotus Development, the US personal computer software company, has reported a
36 per cent drop in second-quarter earnings, blaming product delays and the
reorganisation of its sales force.
Net earnings from operations for the quarter were Dollars 9.7m, or 20 cents
a share, down from Dollars 15.2m, or 35 cents, last year. Revenues were down
5 per cent at Dollars 224m.
In last year's second quarter, Lotus took a Dollars 19.9m charge related to
the acquisition of Approach Software. After the charge, the company reported
a net loss of Dollars 4.6m, or 11 cents a share.
'Product delays, cyclical competitive pressures, the reorganisation of our
US sales force and the transition to a new worldwide channel sales programme
contributed to our disappointing performance,' said Mr Jim Manzi, president
and chief executive.
Lotus failed to release several new products on schedule. It is also under
intense competitive pressure from Microsoft, the largest PC software
company, analysts said. Although Lotus sales of communications software are
growing, it is still heavily dependent upon market segments in which it is
being overtaken by competitors.
Lotus's communications products include Notes, a tool for sharing
information and collaborating across computer networks, and cc:Mail, the
best-selling e-mail program.
'Based on the expected shipment of the delayed products during the next
several weeks and continued momentum in our communications business, we
expect to see improved revenue growth in the second half of the year,' said
Mr Ed Gillis, chief financial officer.
For the half year, net income from operations was up 13 per cent to Dollars
31.1m, or 64 cents a share, on revenues 2 per cent higher at Dollars 471m.
