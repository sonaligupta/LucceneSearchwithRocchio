FT  23 JUL 93 / Lonrho wins right to sue Fayeds


LONRHO, the international trading conglomerate, yesterday won the right to
sue the Fayed brothers for financial loss over an alleged dirty tricks
campaign fought since the brothers gained control of the House of Fraser
stores group.
The Court of Appeal overruled a High Court decision to strike out Lonrho's
claim as 'an abuse of the process of the court'.
But the court refused to reinstate personal damage claims by Mr Tiny Rowland
and Sir Edward du Cann, former Lonrho chairman, which had also been struck
out a year ago.
Lords Justices Dillon, Stuart-Smith and Evans ruled that if they and Lonrho
wanted to claim damages for injury to reputation or feelings they must
launch a separate defamation action.
The feud between the two sides, involving many hard-fought court hearings,
has been going on since 1985 when Mohamed and Ali al-Fayed won control of
the House of Fraser stores group.
Lord Justice Dillon said yesterday that Lonrho had an arguable case that it
suffered financial damage as a result of a 'campaign of vilification'
carried out by a Miss Francesca Pollard, allegedly with the sponsorship and
encouragement of the Fayeds.
The court heard that Miss Pollard claimed that Mr Rowland and others had
cheated her of her Pounds 40m inheritance and pursued a relentless campaign
against him for five years. In 1991 Miss Pollard 'turned her coat' and Mr
Rowland was now supporting her financially.
She was a potential witness for the Lonrho camp and would support the
allegation that she and the Fayeds had conspired to damage Lonrho and its
chief.
The Fayeds will strongly contest the claims.
