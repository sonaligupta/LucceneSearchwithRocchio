FT  24 MAR 92 / International Company News: Lift trucks joint venture set up


   By BARBARA DURR


CATERPILLAR, the world's largest earth-moving equipment maker, and
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of Tokyo, have agreed to form a joint venture to
produce and distribute lift trucks.
The new company, called Mitsubishi Caterpillar Forklift, will become
operative on July 1.
A preliminary accord to explore a possible joint venture had been struck
last December, but the final agreement came last Saturday. MHI will hold 80
per cent of the equity of the new joint venture company and Caterpillar 20
per cent.
While already approved by the two companies' boards, the joint venture is
subject to approval by US, Japanese and European Community authorities.
Its main plants are planned for Houston, Texas, and Almere, in the
Netherlands, though local manufacturing and marketing centres are envisaged
for the Americas, Europe and Asia. The new company will design, manufacture
and distribute lift trucks and other material-handling equipment and related
components.
It plans to vertically integrate with in-house production of components such
as hydraulics and power trains. Its products will be marketed under both the
Caterpillar and Mitsubishi brand names and through the two parents' dealer
organisations.
This latest venture deepens a lengthy working relationship between
Caterpillar and Mitsubishi. Since 1963, they have been business partners in
a joint venture company in Japan, called Shin Caterpillar Mitsubishi, which
designs and manufactures construction equipment.
The announcement comes in the middle of a long and increasingly embittered
strike at Caterpillar by the United Auto Workers. The strike, about to enter
its sixth month, is expected to hurt Caterpillar's results this year.
