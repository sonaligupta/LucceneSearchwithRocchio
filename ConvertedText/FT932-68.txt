FT  30 JUN 93 / International Company News: YPF receives enthusiastic
trading launch


   By JOHN BARHAM and DAMIAN FRASER


   BUENOS AIRES, NEW YORK


TRADING in YPF, Argentina's newly-privatised oil company, got off to a
roaring start yesterday in New York and Buenos Aires. In Buenos Aires,
traders pushed its share price up by 14 per cent to Dollars 21.75, having
earlier touched Dollars 23 amid scenes of frantic activity.
On Monday, the government announced it would sell 45 per cent of YPF at a
price of Dollars 19 per share, raising Dollars 3.04bn in cash in Argentina's
largest privatisation. The issue was oversubscribed by about five times, and
yesterday's trading reflected unsatisfied demand in the wholesale segment.
Mr Win Smith, chairman of Merrill Lynch International, said 'we saw broader
interest in the deal than for any transaction we have ever done,' with the
issue several times over-subscribed in the US, Argentina, and the rest of
the world.
The local and international markets' positive reception for YPF came as a
huge relief for the government. One of its objectives was to use the YPF
privatisation to reactivate Argentina's sickly equity market and open the
door for international share issues by other Argentine companies.
Heavy demand enabled the Argentine government to increase the stock
available to 140m shares from 125m, with an option on another 20m open to
underwriters.
With the market price above the Dollars 19 opening, the option is almost
certain to be taken up. The offering will be divided between 65m shares for
the US, 35m for Argentina and 40m for international mar-kets.
The government has told the worldwide sales team assembled by global
co-ordinators CS First Boston and Merrill Lynch to favour investors planning
to hold YPF for the long term over suspected short-term, speculative
players.
