FT  25 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets: Brazil


SAO Paulo was some 1.7 per cent higher at the close on reports that Brazil
had reached an accord with creditor banks on the recasting of their bond
options to reschedule the Dollars 44bn foreign debt. The Bovespa index was
up 583 at 33,751. Prospects of lower interest rates also provided support
after Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the new economy minister, said that
monetary policy will continue to aim at cutting rates.
