FT  04 AUG 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: The longest day


German gymnast Andreas Wecker, 22, took nearly five hours to complete a drug
test because he was unable to give a sample. Wecker, who won a silver and
two bronzes in the apparatus finals, went to drugs control just after
midnight on Monday. 'I emptied a tray of drinks but nothing came,' Wecker
said. The gymnastics hall was closed at 3am and Wecker was accompanied to
the clinic in the athletes' village. Success finally came at around 5am.
'I have never had such problems before,' he said.
