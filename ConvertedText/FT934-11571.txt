FT  30 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Salomon Brothers


It is nice to see that time has not dimmed Salomon's inventive talents.
Strips - bonds which are separated out into a stream of interest payments
and one lump sum principle repayment - have made Salomon plenty of money.
Having started the market in the early 1980s, Salomon is now turning full
circle and putting the bonds and their interest payments back together
again. Doubtless this is not what Salomon intended in the mid-1980s. But
luck has intervened, since the high-coupon bonds which it split have become
the benchmark for the vast T-bond futures market. Fortune has smiled on
those who take a supple view of markets.
The futures fluke allows Salomon to buy large quantities of the split bonds,
put them back together and hedge them perfectly. Since Salomon's split bonds
have underperformed comparable whole securities, it can also afford to pay
up for their strips and still guarantee themselves a handy profit. Of
course, customers may not be quite so chuffed to buy a premium-priced
product from Salomon, watch it fall behind the basic bond over the best part
of a decade and then sell it back to the same arbitrage desk. Salomon scores
on the way in, the way out, and dealing in between. But on Wall Street,
that's a good trade.
