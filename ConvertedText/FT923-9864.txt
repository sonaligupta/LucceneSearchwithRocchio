Rank Xerox has appointed Herve Gallaire as director of its new European
Research Centre.
Gallaire's move comes at a time when Rank Xerox is aiming to expand its
presence in Europe. The group recently announced that it was investing 235m
Ecu in manufacturing, development and research in Europe, expanding existing
sites in France, the Netherlands, Spain and the UK. A new Dutch factory will
open in September. Part of Gallaire's responsibility will be to set up a new
laboratory on mainland Europe, the site of which will be decided in the near
future.
Before joining Rank Xerox, Gallaire was vice president of software
development at GSI, a leading French software company, and has also held the
post of vice president of software development at Bull, the French computer
company. Gallaire set up the European Computer Industry Research Centre in
Munich, as managing director.

Sunleigh, a company which used to make machine tools and welding equipment,
now specialises in electronic golf carts, dinghies, catamarans and
sportswear. Among Sunleigh's customers are the St Andrews golf club, which
it provides with crested sweaters and shirts. To complete its move into the
leisure business, the company, a late 1980s management buy-out from
engineering group Babcock, has appointed Robert Upsdell non-executive
chairman. Upsdell, 58, held the same position at Gavel Securities, makers of
Laser Dinghies and Dart Catamarans. When Sunleigh acquired a majority
interest in Gavel it appointed Upsdell a non-executive director. Upsdell
previously held senior positions at Courage, EMI Leisure and Ladbroke. He
replaces Sandy Saunders.
