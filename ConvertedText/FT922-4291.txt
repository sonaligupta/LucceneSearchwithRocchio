FT  06 JUN 92 / SE issues proposed Taurus regulations


   By TRACY CORRIGAN


THE LONDON Stock Exchange has announced proposed rules for participation in
its Taurus service, the long-awaited paperless settlement system due to be
launched next year.
The rules outline three main categories: full participants who can move
stock within the system; market participants who send instructions to other
participants to move stock for them; and company controllers and registrars
who can move shares in their own company. Each group must satisfy specific
requirements on technical competence, systems security and financial
adequacy.
The planned rules have been amended after comments on the draft proposals
published in June last year. A further consultative period runs until July
31.
The system is scheduled for launch next April, although testing will be
delayed until January. That follows a hitch in the development of an IBM
system to protect the network from 'hackers'.
