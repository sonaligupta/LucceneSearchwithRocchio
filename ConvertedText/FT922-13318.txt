FT  13 APR 92 / Japanese ruling party shaken by budget chairman's murder

JAPAN'S ruling Liberal Democratic party (LDP) was shaken yesterday by the
murder of Mr Shinjiro Yamamura, the parliamentary budget committee chairman
who had also played an important role in improving links between Japan and
North Korea.
Mr Yamamura, 58, died at his home early yesterday after being stabbed in the
neck and chest. Police have detained his 24-year-old daughter; she was
receiving psychiatric treatment last night.
The politician was due to leave for North Korea today as part of an LDP
delegation attending the 80th birthday celebrations of President Kim Il
Sung. LDP members will seek clarity from Pyongyang on allowing international
inspection of its nuclear facilities, to which the country has recently
agreed.
Mr Yamamura's North Korean connection dates back to 1970, when he offered to
fly to Pyongyang in return for the release of passengers aboard an aircraft
hijacked by a Japanese terrorist group.
He was first elected to parliament in 1964 and, in spite of being implicated
in the Lockheed scandal in 1976, was re-elected nine times, having terms as
transport and agriculture minister.
Mr Yamamura was responsible for successfully steering this year's budget
through parliament.
The LDP easily retained a seat in parliament's upper house yesterday in a
by-election in which it faced little opposition, AP adds.
Mrs Yasu Kano was opposed only by the Communist party in the election in
Ibaraki prefecture. The opposition Socialists did not field a candidate.
