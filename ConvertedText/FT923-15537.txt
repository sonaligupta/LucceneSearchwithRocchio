FT  01 JUL 92 / International Company News: Chrysler debt talks progress


   By PATRICK HARVERSON


CHRYSLER'S negotiations with its bankers over the rescheduling of more than
Dollars 6.8bn of the company's debt should be concluded this month, said the
carmaker's chairman, Mr Lee Iacocca, yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson.
Mr Iacocca said the talks were 'going very well,' thanks to the success of
some of Chrysler's newly-launched vehicles and the company's improving sales
outlook.
An agreement should be reached by July 30, he said, but it could be even
sooner.
Speaking at a production launch for Chrysler's new 'LH' mid-sized car, Mr
Iacocca said the company was ready to operate profitably selling between 2m
and 2.5m vehicles a year over the next five years.
The Chrysler chairman's comments encouraged Wall Street, where the campany's
stock rose Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 21 1/8 on the New York Stock Exchange.
