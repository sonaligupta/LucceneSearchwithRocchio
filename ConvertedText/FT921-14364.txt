FT  16 JAN 92 / Israeli inflation rate reached 18 per cent in 1991


   By HUGH CARNEGY


ISRAELI inflation totalled 18 per cent in 1991, less than had been feared
and only slightly up on 17.6 per cent in 1990, writes Hugh Carnegy.
The biggest single factor was the surge in housing costs, which rose 28 per
cent overall as fears of an immigration-induced housing shortage drove up
prices and rents.
But Russian immigrants' reluctance to take on high levels of debt to
purchase property, and rising availability of new stock arising from a
construction boom, abruptly reversed the trend in the last quarter, when
house prices fell 4 per cent.
