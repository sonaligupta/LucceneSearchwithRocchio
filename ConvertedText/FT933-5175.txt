FT  04 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: Halifax notes slight rise in house
prices last month - At a Glance


House prices last month rose by 0.8 per cent according to
seasonally-adjusted figures released by Halifax, the largest lender.
Nationwide building society, which does not make seasonal adjustments to its
figures, reported a rise of just 0.1 per cent in August. Both indices show
that prices were still lower - by more than 2 per cent - last month compared
with August 1992.
Halifax said that house prices have generally stopped falling but did not
rule out some month-on-month falls during the year. Nationwide also expects
house prices to have shown a 'modest' increase by the end of the year
compared with the end of 1992.
