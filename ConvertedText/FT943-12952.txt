FT  22 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Japan puts conditions on backing Taiwan's
bid to join Gatt

   TAIPEI


Taiwan's trade negotiators yesterday met their Japanese counterparts in
Tokyo to seek Japan's support for Taipei's bid to join the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade. During the talks, Japan requested concessions and set
conditions which Taiwan said could aggravate Taipei's growing trade deficit
with Japan.
Japan insisted on three conditions for granting its support to Taiwan's Gatt
entry bid, according to local newspaper reports.
Japan urged Taiwan to: eliminate restrictions on imports of Japanese cars
and locomotives; amend regulations favouring European and American companies
in government and state enterprise purchasing and in the awarding of major
infrastructure contracts; and lower tariffs and import restrictions on
manufactured industrial products.
Taiwan has drawn up a five-year plan to curb its trade deficit with Japan,
economics minister Mr Chiang Pin-kung said yesterday. Under the plan, the
government will promote Taiwanese products and sales in Japan and cut
imports of Japanese products by obtaining the technology and capital needed
to manufacture products locally.
Mr Chiang said he would raise the issue of Taiwan's deficit during a
ministerial meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) forum
scheduled for October in Osaka.
'We need co-operative measures from both the government and the private
sector in Japan such as tariff cuts and support for Taiwan's industrial
upgrading,' Mr Chiang said.
The bilateral trade deficit was Dollars 14.42bn (Pounds 9.3bn) in 1993 and
is forecast to top Dollars 16bn this year.
Taiwan has said it wants to join Gatt by the end of this year in order to
become a founding member of the World Trade Organisation which supersedes
Gatt on January 1.
