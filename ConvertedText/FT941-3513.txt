FT  16 MAR 94 / Fishermen want seal culling resumed


   By JAMES BUXTON


Fishermen want seal culling to be renewed to cut down the growing numbers of
seals which they say are threatening their livelihoods by damaging fish
stocks and equipment, James Buxton writes.
A group from the Scottish Fishermens' Federation, including representatives
of English and Irish fishermen's organisations, will tell Scottish Natural
Heritage, the environmental agency for Scotland, that since culling was
banned in 1978 it estimates the number of grey seals around the UK coast has
risen from 70,000 to between 100,000 and 110,000. About 90,000 are thought
to be in Scottish waters.
Mr Roddy McColl, chairman of the group, says it has scientific evidence
suggesting that seals are eating up to 240,000 tonnes of fish a year. This
means that 'seals have a substantial EU quota to themselves'.
