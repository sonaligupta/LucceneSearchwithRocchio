FT  20 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour back benchers embarrass
leadership over Weatherill peerage


A SMALL group of Labour backbenchers, led by Mr Dennis Skinner, MP for
Bolsover, embarrassed the party's leadership in the Commons yesterday by
opposing the award of a peerage to Mr Bernard Weatherill, who recently
retired after nearly nine years as speaker.
In accordance with custom, MPs were asked to approve a motion formally
asking the Queen to 'confer some signal mark of her Royal favour' on Mr
Weatherill.
With vociferous support from some of his leftwing colleagues, Mr Skinner
said he was opposed to the House of Lords and wanted to see the 'classless
society' advocated by Mr John Major, the prime minister.
The motion was approved by a majority of 232 (247-15).
