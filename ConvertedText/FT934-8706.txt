FT  13 NOV 93 / Seasonal food and drink - The best of British: Thirty young
super chefs


   By NICHOLAS LANDER


OVER THE past couple of months two serious criticisms have been levelled at
the standard of cooking in British restaurants.
The first came via Adele Biss, chairman of the British Tourist Authority,
who, after a tour of BTA offices in Europe, reported that the most frequent
inquiry from those planning to visit Britain is not concern about the
weather but about the food.
These ungrounded fears were given credence by a survey in The Economist on
the quality of life in Britain. Restaurant cooking here, it moaned, was not
comparable to that of France or Italy. It said Britain was a great place to
live if you liked 'ethnic food' and fish and chips.
I do not wish to sound John Bullish but this is balderdash. The improvement
in cooking skills over the past 20 years has been as big as that in the
quality of British produce.
Here are my top 30 'young' British chefs with apologies for any omissions -
it could easily have been 50. (Phone numbers are 071 unless stated).
LONDON
Philip Britten, The Capital Hotel, SW3 (589-5171). Smart British cooking and
particularly good value at lunch.
Stephen Bull's Bistro EC1 (490-1750), Restaurant W1 (486-9696). A thoughtful
and intense chef. The former site noisier, hotter but cheaper than the
latter.
Sally Clarke, W8 (221-9225). The freshest produce, simply grilled. One chef
who gives equal importance to salads and vegetables.
Richard Corrigan, Bentley's, Swallow Street, W1 (734-4756), is a chef with a
talent for preparing pork.
Johnathan Hayes, Chinon, W14 (602-4082). An underrated and under-exposed
talent.
Simon Hopkinson, Bibendum, SW3 (581-5817). Exquisite food in exquisite
surroundings, unfortunately now at very high prices.
Philip Howard, The Square SW1 (839-8787). Modern, rather worked, food in a
modern setting near Christie's.
Martin Lam, Ransome's Dock, SW11 (223-1611). A family affair. His wife works
on the pastry section.
Alastair Little, W1 (734-5183). Exciting cooking, the benchmark for other
British chefs.
Rowley Leigh, Kensington Place, W8 (727-3184). The number one in terms of
quality of food to quantity of customers served.
Mark and Max Renzland, Le Petit Max, Hampton Wick (081-977-0236). Fabulous
French food and great value prepared by twin brothers from Essex in the most
unpretentious surroundings.
Gary Rhodes, The Greenhouse, W1 (499-3331). Not the founder of the oxtail,
salmon fish cake and steamed pudding repertoire but one of its most eloquent
exponents.
Adam Robinson, The Brackenbury, W6 (081-748-0107). Serving good food,
Robinson is at the forefront of the culinary 'rat-pack'.
Bryan Webb, Hilaire, SW7 (584 8993). An industrious Welsh chef often
utilising the best Welsh produce.
Marco-Pierre White, The Hyde Park Hotel, SW1 (235-2000). Obviously talented.
Will his new surroundings deliver calm and consistency?
Anthony Worrall Thompson, dell'Ugo W1 (734-8000), Bistrot 190, SW7
(581-5666).
REST OF ENGLAND
David Adlard, Adlard's, Norwich, Norfolk (0603-633522),
