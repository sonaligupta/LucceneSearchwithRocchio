FT  22 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Sequal trade system to be
launched today


   By RICHARD WATERS


THE SECOND of three electronic trade confirmation systems, designed to help
institutions confirm securities trades in Europe more efficiently, will be
launched today in the face of complaints that it will stifle competition.
The London Stock Exchange's Sequal is one of three systems approved by a
group of investment institutions, which set out a year ago to promote better
pre-settlement systems in Europe.
However, the exchange's plans have prompted a complaint to the UK's Office
of Fair Trading from a rival system provider, the Thomson group, on the
grounds the exchange will make its system compulsory for its members.
The exchange said the complaint was based on a misunderstanding, though it
accepted it had helped provoke the confrontation. Sequal is due to replace
Checking, the trade reporting system which is compulsory for exchange
members. By implication, Sequal will also be compulsory.
The exchange said it would not take a decision on the issue for some time.
Until it does, the OFT will have no new grounds on which to investigate its
operations.
The situations of the three trade confirmation systems is complicated by the
different regulatory position of the various providers. The exchange, for
instance, claims a duty under the Financial Services Act to ensure trades
are completed, forcing it to require brokers to use its own trade
confirmation system.
