FT  25 MAR 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report


   By REUTER


NICKEL was under pressure on the LME, although the market closed off a 2 1/2
 month low of Dollars 7,320 a tonne for three-month metal. Dealers said the
decline below Dollars 7,400 in the morning prompted technical and stop-loss
selling, with short covering rallies soon losing steam. European end-user
demand is light and fresh Russian metal is arriving in Europe, but 1992
tonnages are lagging behind last year's levels. Three-month TIN was quietly
steadier at the close and looking to move above resistance around Dollars
5,670. Despite slack end-user interest the market remains underpinned by
premiums for quality brands. London COCOA prices moved higher, supported by
a stronger dollar against sterling. Dealers, noting an absence of fresh
fundamental news, said there was little expectation that much progress would
be made at this week's ICCO talks in London. Some said the expectation of
Ivory Coast sales was still hanging over the market, but others said concern
had weakened. GOLD appeared to be finding support on the London bullion
market in the Dollars 336 to Dollars 337 area from consumer buying, but is
being capped on the upside by producer selling at about Dollars 340 a troy
ounce.
