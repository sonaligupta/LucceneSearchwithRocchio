FT  26 JUN 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Pixels promise better image


   By PAUL TAYLOR


High resolution digital cameras are now an essential tool in medical
analysis, microscopy, non-contact measurement and precision testing in
industrial research and production.
However, these cameras leave spaces between each pixel - meaning that a
computer has to estimate the image within these 'dead' areas. Now Kodak has
launched the 'Megaplus' camera which is designed to capture high resolution
1320 by 1035 pixel digital images. Uniquely, each square pixel is contiguous
with its neighbour, ensuring full image accuracy.
One hundred per cent image coverage is vital for areas like non-contact
measurement of electronic components, chemical structures or parts of the
human body too sensitive to be touched. These measurements often require
microscopic accuracy which can only be delivered by total image coverage and
capture. Kodak US 619 535 2908; UK,0442 61122.
