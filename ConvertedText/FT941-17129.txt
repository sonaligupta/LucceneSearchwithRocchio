FT  06 JAN 94 / House prices up 1.2%, says Halifax


   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent


UK house prices rose on average by 1.2 per cent last year, the first
increase since 1990 and the highest annual rise since 1989, Halifax,
Britain's biggest mortgage lender, reported yesterday.
The annual increase was less than half that reported by Nationwide building
society, which on Tuesday said prices last year had risen by 3.3 per cent.
Halifax said its survey would have shown a higher annual increase but for a
fall of 0.5 per cent in average house prices in December compared with
November.
December is traditionally one of the weakest periods for house sales in the
UK. Prices of new houses last month are estimated by the society to have
fallen by 2 per cent since the end of November.
Halifax said the effect of the latest fall meant that the average price of a
new home had declined by 0.5 per cent since December 1992. The figures,
however, do not measure the impact of sales incentives, such as subsidised
mortgages, which are being phased out gradually by builders as the market
recovers.
The figures are in marked contrast to those published by Nationwide, which
showed a 0.8 per cent rise for all types of houses in December.
The Halifax survey uses a larger sample of mortgage loans than does
Nationwide, and also included the whole of the extended Christmas holiday
period. Nationwide included mortgage offers up to December 22.
Halifax said yesterday: 'In spite of the fall in December, house prices have
generally become firmer in the second half of 1993. Although some
month-on-month falls remain possible over the winter, we continue to expect
the recovery to strengthen in 1994 and house prices to rise by about 5 per
cent over the course of the year.'
Halifax said that the price of an average home had risen from Pounds 61,169
to Pounds 61,928 during the past 12 months. The last annual price rise, in
1990, was 0.5 per cent while prices in 1989 rose by 2.8 per cent.
It said the yearly increase for 1993 was close to the last published annual
UK inflation rate of 1.4 per cent for November.
Halifax expects the number of sales - which are thought to have risen by
about 5 per cent in England and Wales last year - to rise by about 15 per
cent this year over the UK as whole.
The society said that UK house prices, even after last year's increase,
remain 11.5 per cent lower than during the summer of 1989. Price falls in
south-east England and East Anglia have been even greater, with the average
cost of a home declining by 27 per cent and 31 per cent respectively since
the end of 1989.
Even if prices were now to rise at an average of 5 per cent a year, it would
take until next century for many prices to get back to the levels prevailing
in the late 1980s.
