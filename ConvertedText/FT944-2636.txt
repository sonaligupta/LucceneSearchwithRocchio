FT  16 DEC 94 / MPs criticise coastguard savings target


Government cost-cutting plans could affect the Coastguard Service's ability
to respond to emergencies, the Commons transport committee said yesterday.
The service was 'thinly stretched' with fewer staff having to deal with an
ever-growing number of incidents, it said in a report.
Pressures on the service, which is responsible for co-ordinating search and
rescue operations, may have led it to rely too heavily on overtime and
part-time auxiliary coastguards.
The MPs added: 'Given financial pressures under which the agency is
presently operating, we are concerned that its present financial target of
achieving a 6.4 per cent saving in the next 18 months might adversely affect
the provision of coastguard services.'
The savings target followed the abandonment of the government's plan to cut
costs by 20 per cent, after the establishment of the service as an executive
agency of the Department of Transport last April.
MPs were concerned the new target, agreed by the service and the transport
department, may have been set too hastily.
They were 'heartened' by assurances from the chief executive that savings
were agreed on the understanding they would not involve closing rescue
centres or detract from operational effectiveness.
Since 1986, the report said, the number of search and rescue incidents dealt
with by the service rose 81 per cent, from 5,300 to 9,610 in 1993. The
number of people rescued increased 91 per cent, from 8,960 to 17,110 last
year.
Over the same period the number of staff fell 7 per cent to its present 480
full-time officers and some 4,000 auxiliaries.
The MPs heard evidence from unions that staff morale was at 'an all-time
low'.
