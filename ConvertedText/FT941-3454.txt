FT  16 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Scottish salmon competitive


   From Mr JIM PAYNE


Sir, In the letter 'Scottish salmon also subsidised' (March 14), Mr Roderick
Thomas wildly exaggerates the level of support which has been received by
the Scottish salmon farming industry. Moreover, in every case, any support
for the industry has been completely in accordance with European Union
rules.
Contrary to what he states, Norway has no natural advantages over Scotland
for growing salmon. This is why the performance of Scottish farms is now as
good, or possibly better, than those in Norway.
There is no truth in the statement that Norwegian salmon farms are
profitable at a price of 20 per cent to 30 per cent lower than the cost of
production in Scotland. The most careful analysis reveals that costs of
production are roughly comparable in both countries.
Mr Thomas is also wrong about the threat from Chile. Chile can compete only
in Europe on frozen salmon. The freight cost for fresh salmon from Chile to
Europe makes that business uneconomic. Otherwise, of course, there would be
fresh salmon arriving in Europe now, at a time when the Chileans are
vigorously searching for new markets.
