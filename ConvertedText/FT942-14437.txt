FT  20 APR 94 / International Company News: Krupp Hoesch posts DM590m loss

   HANOVER


Krupp Hoesch, the German steel and engineering group, yesterday reported
1993 net losses of DM590m (Dollars 347m), but said it hoped to break even
this year.
Mr Gerhard Cromme, chief executive, said that although the steel division
would be the only loss-making unit this year, capacity cuts and productivity
gains meant that prospects for steel were improving.
His mild optimism was confirmed by the German Steel Federation, which said
production and incoming orders for German steelmakers in the first quarter
were 10 per cent higher than the year before.
Turnover at Krupp Hoesch fell to DM24bn, from DM27.8bn the previous year.
The company said the machine tools division reported a slight loss while
steel losses had been the main reason for the result.
The other four divisions made profits but Mr Cromme would not give further
details before the 1993 results, the first year after the merger of Krupp
and Hoesch, which will be presented in mid-May.
