FT  22 DEC 92 / Rhone-Poulenc in plant agreement with Chinese

RHONE-POULENC, France's leading chemicals group, has reached a co-operation
agreement with the Chinese government to build and operate two plants with
local partners, and to license technology there.
This is Rhone-Poulenc's first industrial investment in China, where it plans
to supply the fast-growing textiles industry with artifical fibres.
The largest plant, requiring an investment of up to FFr1bn (Pounds 120m) in
north-east China, is expected to start producing nylon salt (granulates
which turn into nylon when heated) in about three years, in partnership with
Sinopec, a Chinese state-owned group.
A smaller plant, to produce high-performance plastics, is scheduled to open
in two years near Shanghai, according to Mr Michel Maupu, Rhone-Poulenc's
vice-president in charge of fibres and polymers.
The licensing deal covers technology for producing nylon salt, to a
Chinese-owned company being set up in the central province of Henan for that
purpose.
The French group has been selling nylon salt to China for 18 years and now
exports FFr700m-worth annually there. It expects Chinese production of
synthetic fibres to grow from 1.65m tonnes in 1990 to 2.8m tonnes a year by
the end of the decade, as more textile and tyre production shifts to
low-labour-cost countries.
