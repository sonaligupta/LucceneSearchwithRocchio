FT  22 DEC 92 / Courtaulds Textiles pension scheme to reduce surplus


   By BARRY RILEY


COURTAULDS Textiles is to restructure its pension scheme to reduce a surplus
which has reached 55 per cent of liabilities on prudent assumptions.
The clothing and fabrics manufacturer, which was demerged from the
Courtaulds fibres and chemicals group in 1990, will increase benefits and
withdraw Pounds 32m in cash for the company's benefit, although more than
Pounds 12m of this will go in tax. These moves will cost Pounds 38m.
Mr Martin Taylor, chief executive, said yesterday that the surplus
represented dead money. 'We are trying to bring to life an asset which is
far greater than is required for prudence.'
The plan will be implemented in January now several months of negotiations
with the pension scheme's trustees - who voted 9-1 in favour - and the
Inland Revenue have been completed.
Last March the pension scheme showed a surplus of Pounds 74m on the basis
favoured by the trustees. A less conservative basis, calculated for the
purposes of the accounting standard SSAP 24, indicated a surplus of Pounds
104m (or 85 per cent overfunding).
Courtaulds Textiles has a very immature pension scheme because when it was
split from the main Courtaulds scheme in 1990 all the pensioners stayed with
the original plan and the Textiles scheme took just under 10,000 members in
employment. Much of the surplus was inherited from the main scheme.
It says contributions by Courtaulds in the 1970s and 1980s were in
retrospect too high, while stock market performance was very favourable in
the 1980s and especially good for the Courtaulds fund.
In fact the fund has outperformed the average UK pension fund by 2 per cent
a year on average over the past decade, which explains much of the surplus.
The investment portfolio continues to be managed by the main Courtaulds
scheme, on a unitised basis.
The impact of the restructuring on the company's profit and loss account
will be complex. The Pounds 19m cash will create interest savings in 1993
and some Pounds 0.25m of administration costs are also being transferred to
the pension scheme. However, an accounting benefit from the surplus is
already being received, and this SSAP 24 credit may fall from Pounds 4.8m
for 1992 to under Pounds 2m.
