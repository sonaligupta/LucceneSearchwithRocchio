FT  15 APR 94 / UK Company News: Biotechnology placing raises Pounds 35m


   By DAVID WIGHTON


Zeneca, the bioscience group demerged last year from Imperial Chemical
Industries, has taken Pounds 5m of shares in International Biotechnology
Trust which is being launched by Rothschild Asset Management.
Rothschild announced yesterday that a placing of shares with warrants, with
institutions and other investors, including Zeneca, had raised Pounds 35.1m
 -less than half the figure originally hoped for.
Rothschild's target was Pounds 100m, including proceeds from a public offer
for subscription which opened yesterday.
Mr Jeremy Curnock Cook, a director of Rothschild Asset Management and leader
of the investment advisory team, said 'in the light of current market
conditions I am pleased with the support for the placing'.
