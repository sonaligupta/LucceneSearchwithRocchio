FT  20 APR 94 / International Company News: Philip Morris shakes off price
war


   By RICHARD TOMKINS


   NEW YORK


Philip Morris, the US food and tobacco group, is showing signs of recovering
from the effects of cuts in the prices of its premium cigarettes.
Net income for the quarter until March, excluding the effect of an
accounting change last year, was down by just 3.5 per cent, to Dollars
1.17bn, from Dollars 1.21bn in the comparable period last time. The figure
was struck on sales up 2 per cent at Dollars 15.5bn.
The fall in earnings per share was still smaller because of the company has
been buying back its stock. Excluding accounting changes, it was down 2.9
per cent to Dollars 1.34.
The results were better than analysts had expected, and the shares, recently
depressed by an outbreak of hostility to the US tobacco industry from
anti-smoking activists and politicians, put on Dollars 1 5/8 to close at
Dollars 51 7/8 in New York.
Yesterday's figures were the last to show an adverse comparison with the
more buoyant results reported before the round of price-cutting in US
cigarette prices a year ago. Philip Morris slashed the price of its Marlboro
cigarettes to defend falling market share against competition from low-cost
products.
It said its strategy had succeeded in lifting Malboro's share of the
domestic cigarette market back to 27.3 per cent, up 5.2 percentage points
over last year. Operating income was still down - by 24.5 per cent to
Dollars 769m - in domestic tobacco because of lower pricing. International
tobacco was up 17.4 per cent to Dollars 791m.
