FT  19 APR 94 / Power group wins supply contract


Yorkshire Electricity has secured a contract to supply power to BOC, the
large industrial gas producer with 23 sites in the UK.
The contract was made possible by the easing of the electricity market which
allows users of more than 100KW a year to shop around for suppliers.
BOC said Yorkshire won the business 'on the lowest price in what turned out
to be a complex shifting market'.
