FT  29 JUL 92 / Liffe fines options trader Pounds 25,000


THE London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange has fined Mr
Giles Robinson, an options trader formerly registered with Refco Overseas, a
total of Pounds 25,000 for breaching Liffe rules. The exchange also revoked
his registration as a trader.
Mr Robinson was found by Liffe to have manipulated certain transactions in
March 1991 by abusing trading priority. Although it was accepted that Refco
had no knowledge of the rule breaches, the firm was fined Pounds 56,500 as
member firms are held responsible for their employees' conduct.
