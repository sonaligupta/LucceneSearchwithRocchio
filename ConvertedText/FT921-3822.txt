FT  12 MAR 92 / Arrest over 'terrorist ultimatum from east'


GERMAN police have arrested a man suspected of threatening a wave of
terrorist attacks unless the interior minister, Mr Rudolf Seiters, handed
over DM12m (Pounds 4.1m).
The government spokesman, Mr Dieter Vogel, quoted the justice minister, Mr
Klaus Kinkel, as saying the extortion attempt may have been made by former
members of the East German secret police. He said the cabinet discussed the
issue when it met in Bonn yesterday.
The Federal Crime Office (BKA) said anti-terror units seized the suspect on
Tuesday after a pre-dawn motorway chase near the Polish border as police
couriers were being directed by car telephone to a money drop in Germany's
former communist east. The suspect was named as 'Dieter Z', a 36-year-old
east German who moved to Bremen in 1987.
Police said they were alerted after a letter was sent to Mr Seiters in
February signed by 'members of a special military unit of a state that no
longer exists'. The letter claimed the group was trained to assassinate
political and business leaders, attack public places, knock out
communications, and poison drinking water.
