FT  25 AUG 92 / ANC to join exploratory talks


   By REUTER


   JOHANNESBURG


The South African government is to hold exploratory talks with the ANC and
the Pan-Africanist Congress during the next 48 hours, Reuter reports from
Johannesburg. Government spokesman Izak Retief said Mr Roelf Meyer, the
chief government negotiator, was due to meet a PAC delegation yesterday and
would probably resume direct talks with ANC secretary-general Cyril
Ramaphosa today.
Mr Retief said Mr Meyer also planned talks soon with a breakaway right-wing
party and with Mr Andries Treurnicht's Conservative Party, which might be
ready to reverse its earlier refusal to join the talks.
