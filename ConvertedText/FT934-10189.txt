FT  06 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Jobs data helps Dow overcome
early falls

Wall Street
ALTHOUGH further declines in bond prices continued to trouble US stock
markets yesterday, share prices staged an impressive recovery from early
losses to end mostly higher at the final bell, writes Patrick Harverson in
New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 18.45 at 3,643.43. The
more broadly based Standard&Poor's 500 ended 2.08 higher at 459.57, while
the Amex composite finished down 2.20 at 475.33, and the Nasdaq composite up
5.72 at 762.98. Trading volume on the NYSE was 333m shares.
Share prices gyrated wildly throughout the day as the stock markets were
buffeted by rising bond yields and program trading. The latest sell-off in
the bond market - which eventually pushed the benchmark 30-year bond down
half a point and the yield up to 6.2 per cent - was sparked by the news that
non-farm payrolls rose 177,000 in October.
The long-awaited jobs data proved more bullish than the bond market had
expected, particularly the strength in some of the non-headline statistics,
such as manufacturing jobs and working hours. Although this was good news
for stocks, equity investors were at first unsettled by the continuing rise
in long-term interest rates. Consequently, stocks struggled to break out of
early losses. At one point, the Dow was down 25 points at 3,600 and the
Nasdaq composite down 9 points at 748.37, with dealers blaming some of the
decline on reports that North Korea had massed troops on its border with
South Korea in preparation for a possible military attack on its neighbour.
Later in the day, however, the market began to draw strength from the jobs
data, and as bonds came off their lows and the Korean fears receded, prices
ended the session sharply higher amid a flurry of late buying. Banks rallied
strongly from recent weakness. Citicorp firmed Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 36
1/2 , Chase Manhattan added Dollars 1 at Dollars 32 3/8 , JP Morgan firmed
Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 69 7/8 , Chemical put on Dollars 1 at Dollars 38
7/8 and BankAmerica added Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 41 7/8 .
Similarly, many of the leading stocks, which suffered in Wednesday and
Thursday's sell-off, also recovered. McDonald's rose Dollars 1 3/4 to
Dollars 55 3/4 , AT&T added Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 56 and Motorola put on
Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 98 7/8 .
Home Shopping Network rose Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 12 3/4 and QVC Network
fell Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 53 1/4 after the two companies said that they
had decided to abandon their planned merger. QVC is currently embroiled with
Viacom in a fight to take over Paramount Communications.
On the Nasdaq market, leading Nasdaq technology stocks, which have fallen
sharply in recent days, rebounded. Microsoft added Dollars 2 1/4 at Dollars
78 3/4 and Intel put on Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 60 3/4 .
Canada
TORONTO stocks fell from the opening to hit their lowest level in the late
morning, before recovering to close with just a small loss.
The TSE-300 composite index closed down 11.70 points, or 0.28 per cent, at
4202.03, for a loss on the week of about 53.5 points. The index hit its low
point of 4,160 at about 11 am EST. Final turnover was CDollars 797.4m.
Eleven of the 14 sub-indices lost ground, although there were few noteworthy
declines.
