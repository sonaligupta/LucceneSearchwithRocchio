FT  22 APR 93 / Spending cuts anger military in Argentina


   By JOHN BARHAM


   BUENOS AIRES


ARGENTINA'S armed forces are threatening protest action following government
demands for a 10 per cent spending cut.
The air force commander, Brigadier Jose Julia, told Mr Oscar Camilion, the
new defence minister, that he was cancelling all operational and training
flights. Navy and army commanders are expected to make similar threats at
meetings this week with Mr Camilion, who took office earlier this month.
Brig Julia said he had no choice but to cease operations. Half the air
force's aircraft were already grounded and it had still not replaced
aircraft lost during the 1982 Falklands conflict.
The defence budget was set at Dollars 2.03bn this year, 5 per cent of
federal spending. However, in March, Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister,
ordered a 10 per cent cut in ministerial budgets to compensate for a
shortfall in tax revenues.
Ironically, the budget cut may at last force a review of defence policy. The
armed forces may have surrendered their traditionally strong political role
but have resisted half-hearted government efforts at military reforms.
Pay consumes 72 per cent of their budget, but commanders have avoided
cutting jobs or reorganising their top-heavy command structure. The army has
one officer for every five enlisted men and conscripts. Last year's armed
forces' payroll of 169,000 included 35,000 civilian and industrial employees
and 49,000 pensioners.
Officers claim the government has no defence policy other than budget cuts,
which have eroded morale and reduced defence preparedness without improving
operational efficiency.
Pay is the military's greatest grievance, but President Carlos Menem has
ignored previous pleas for increases. Unlike many of his civilian
predecessors, he feels confident in his relationship with the military.
