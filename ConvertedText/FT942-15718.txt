FT  14 APR 94 / Compensation scheme levy


The Investors Compensation Scheme is raising a levy of Pounds 17.5m to meet
the estimated costs of compensation and management for the 12 months to the
end of March this year.
The ICS offers a safety net for investors who are entitled to redress but
find that the company responsible for their predicament has gone out of
business. The bulk of the charge - Pounds 15.4m - will fall on Fimbra, the
self-regulating organisation for independent financial advisers.
