FT  26 MAY 93 / People: From airways to airwaves


The former managing director of Air Europe is to be managing director of the
newly formed resources, engineering and services directorate of the BBC.
Rod Lynch, 44, will take over from Bill Dennay, who has overseen the
creation of the new directorate and retires at the end of this month after
37 years at the BBC.
Lynch is currently sales and marketing director with Forte Hotels.
He will have a seat on the BBC board of management and will report to Bob
Phillis, deputy director general of the Corporation.
Phillis said yesterday Lynch would bring 'a wealth of broad commercial
experience'.
Lynch had 20 years in the airline business, 18 of them at British Airways.
The new resource directorate brings together all the separate business units
created under Producer Choice - the system which gives BBC producers the
right to buy services in the outside market if they want to.
