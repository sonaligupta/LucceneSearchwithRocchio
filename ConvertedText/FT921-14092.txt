FT  17 JAN 92 / Nissan to raise Sunderland capacity 30%


   By JOHN GRIFFITHS


NISSAN plans to spend Pounds 200m at its Sunderland car plant in north-east
England, increasing capacity by more than a third to 300,000 units annually
by next year.
The move, to be announced in Tokyo this morning by Mr Yutaka Kume, Nissan
president, will intensify concerns of indigenous European vehicle producers
about the potential long-term volume of Japanese car production in the UK.
Nissan plans output next year of 270,000, more than double the 124,000
achieved in 1991. The latest move to raise capacity - the second within a
year - brings its output expansion far beyond what most in the industry
expected.
The latest spending at Sunderland will create 600 jobs and bring investment
at the 760-acre site to Pounds 900m. It will make the Nissan project the
single biggest inward investment by a Japanese company in Europe, overtaking
Toyota's Pounds 840m car and engine-manufacturing projects at Derby and
Shotton on Deeside.
Mr Peter Lilley, trade and industry secretary, said the expansion
'demonstrates that we remain the most important home for inward investment
in Europe'. He said he did not expect objections from other EC members.
The increase will lift Nissan's UK production above the 200,000 originally
projected when the venture was announced in the early 1980s.
Last year, Nissan Motor Manufacturing (UK) had said it intended to raise
production to 220,000 in 1993. It produced 124,000 cars in 1991 and expects
to produce 175,000 this year after production of a second model, the Micra,
starts in the second half of the year.
The investment plan was welcomed by component makers which stand to gain
substantial new business. As the Micra replacement comes in, the number of
parts suppliers will grow from 179 to 195 with most of the extra suppliers
also British.
Of the Pounds 200m total, some Pounds 150m will go on expanding NMUK's own
facilities. The remaining Pounds 50m is being spent on expanding body
pressing capacity at Nissan Yamato Engineering, an 80 per cent Nissan-owned
joint venture adjoining the assembly operations.
With little left of the UK machine tool industry, the lion's share of the
plant and equipment spending is expected to go to overseas suppliers, mainly
in Japan and Germany.
The extra workers will bring the labour force directly employed by NMUK at
Sunderland to 4,600, with another 1,400 jobs spread among adjacent component
makers.
