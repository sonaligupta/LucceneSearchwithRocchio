FT  28 MAR 92 / Rise in income boosts spending


   By MICHAEL PROWSE


   WASHINGTON


US PERSONAL income rose 1.1 per cent in February, the largest monthly gain
for three years, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. The surge in
incomes, which exceeded Wall Street's expectations, helped explain the
surprisingly robust recovery in US retail spending since Christmas. The
higher spending has sparked speculation that the long-awaited recovery from
recession is under way.
In real, inflation-adjusted terms, yesterday's figures showed a 0.6 per cent
rise in personal consumption spending last month. Revised January figures
showed a gain of 0.9 per cent.
Many economists expect higher consumption spending to underpin a modest
growth of gross domestic product in the first quarter. Revised figures
published on Thursday showed GDP growing at an annual rate of 0.4 per cent
in the final quarter of last year, down from an earlier estimate of 0.8 per
cent growth.
With personal savings rates low, the recovery of consumption spending is
likely to be sustained only if employment continues to grow.
