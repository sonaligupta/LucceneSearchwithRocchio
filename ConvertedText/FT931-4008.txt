FT  12 MAR 93 / International Company News: BTR Nylex surprises with strong
advance to ADollars 365m


   By BRUCE JACQUES


BTR Nylex, the Australian manufacturing arm of BTR of the UK, has exceeded
most analysts' forecasts with a big rise in profits, sales and dividend for
1992.
Net profits advanced 33.6 per cent to ADollars 365.4m (USDollars 261m) from
ADollars 273.6m on a 15.9 per cent rise in sales to ADollars 5.73bn from
ADollars 4.95bn. The annual dividend is being raised to 10 cents a share
from 9.5 cents.
Directors said the results, which included first-time contributions from
recent acquisitions Westinghouse Brake and Signal and Hawker de Havilland,
was achieved despite difficult trading conditions. 'Significant benefits
came from the restructuring carried out over the last two years and the
continuing attention to increased productivity,' they said.
'Whilst economic activity appears patchy, there are encouraging signs of
modest economic improvement in Australasia and North America.' Directors
said benefits from the capital expenditure, which rose to ADollars 541.5m
from ADollars 447.8m, would be felt in the current year. The packaging
division was the main source of the rise in earnings, lifting its pre-tax
contribution to ADollars 323.0m from ADollars 252.7m.
