FT  15 JUN 93 / BIS Annual Report: Europe urged to re-peg currencies to the
D-Mark  - A look at the annual report of the Bank for International
Settlements


   By PETER MARSH


EUROPE must re-peg its currencies to the D-Mark to head off growing
protectionist pressures, Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, general manager of the
Bank for International Settlements, said yesterday.
Speaking after the bank's annual meeting, Mr Lamfalussy said the present
arrangement, in which Britain and Italy were no longer in the European
exchange rate mechanism and the currencies of Sweden, Finland and Norway
were floating, was 'not sustainable in the longer term'.
In linking the ERM turbulence of the past year with trade, Mr Lamfalussy was
underlining how some nations in the ERM - notably France - believed
devaluation of the pound and lira enabled the UK and Italy to boost growth
at the expense of other European nations by helping export competitiveness.
Mr Lamfalussy said devaluation of several European currencies in the past
year could 'cause problems' among their trading partners. 'If someone could
prove to me that floating currencies are compatible with relatively stable
real exchange rates then my argument wouldn't hold - but in the past this
hasn't happened,' he said.
The report's downbeat tone was backed by comments yesterday by Mr Bengt
Dennis, BIS chairman and president of the Swedish central bank. Mr Dennis
said ERM turbulence last year had 'undoubtedly contributed to erosion of
business and consumer confidence' in Europe and said 'especially worrisome'
was the deepening German recession.
On future exchange rate management in Europe, he said changes in information
technology and the culture of private currency investors made the task of
goverments seeking stable long-term relationships between currencies
'clearly more difficult.'
