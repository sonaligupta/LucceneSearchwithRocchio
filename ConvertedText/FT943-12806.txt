FT  22 JUL 94 / International Company News: General Dynamics up 3.7%


   By FRANK MCGURTY


   NEW YORK


General Dynamics, the US defence contractor, yesterday reported
second-quarter earnings of Dollars 56m, or 88 cents a share, up 3.7 per
cent, saying that its pared-down operations had showed steady improvement in
the second quarter.
The results underscored the success of the cutbacks which were largely
completed this spring with the sale of its Space Launch Systems arm.
The figures for the continuing businesses, which were slightly better than
analysts had predicted, compare with net income of Dollars 54m, or 85 cents,
in the corresponding 1993 quarter.
Revenues were up nearly 10 per cent at Dollars 820m.
The 1994 results exclude a one-time net gain of Dollars 15m from the
disposal of the space division, acquired by Martin Marietta for Dollars
208m. The year-earlier figures take no account of a Dollars 9m non-recurring
gain and reflect a two-for-one stock split in April.
Mr James Mellor, who took over as chairman and chief executive two months
ago, attributed the solid performance in part to efforts to cut costs and
boost productivity. The group's cash balance was Dollars 988m at the end of
June, up from Dollars 711m three months ago.
General Dynamics once produced a wide array of weapons systems but is
engaged now in the manufacture of only submarines and tanks.
The electric boat division was recently awarded Dollars 130m in start-up
funding to build a third Seawolf-class attack submarine for the US Navy. At
the armoured vehicles division, the company said yesterday, there was
progress in settling a month-long strike by 2,000 workers.
For the first six months of the year, General Dynamics posted net earnings
of Dollars 126m, compared with Dollars 748m in the 1993 period, when it
booked a Dollars 645m net gain on the sale of its Tactical Military Aircraft
business. Revenues were flat at Dollars 1.6bn.
