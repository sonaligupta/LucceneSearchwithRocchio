FT  19 APR 94 / UK Company News: Lucas sets Simpson salary at Pounds 340,000


   By ANDREW BOLGER


Lucas Industries is paying Mr George Simpson, its new chief executive, an
annual salary of Pounds 340,000.
The figure is well below what the automotive and aerospace components group
was rumoured to have offered Mr Simpson, the former deputy chief executive
of British Aerospace and chairman of Rover Group, BAe's vehicles subsidiary.
Mr Simpson's basic salary is in line with the Pounds 355,000 which Sir
Anthony Gill earned last year while acting as both chairman and chief
executive. However, bonuses could boost Mr Simpson's annual salary to Pounds
400,000.
He has been granted options on just over 700,000 Lucas shares at 194p each,
which cannot be exercised for another three years.
