FT  17 JAN 92 / Corruption case resurfaces in France


   By WILLIAM DAWKINS


   PARIS


A LONG-RUNNING scandal over corrupt fund-raising by political parties has
resurfaced in France, following a police raid on the Paris headquarters of
the governing Socialist party.
The investigation, ordered by Mr Renaud Van Ruymbeke, an examining judge,
has not yet led to any charges, but it is an embarrassment for the
Socialists in the run-up to the regional elections in March.
Police have been investigating allegations of local authority corruption,
involving thousands of elected politicians of all parties, for the past
three years.
It has been claimed in court that building companies paid phoney consultancy
firms owned by party supporters, in exchange for the use of political
influence to obtain contracts.
Parliament voted an amnesty for wrongdoers two years ago, but this is
supposed to cover officials and not MPs.
Socialist officials say they have nothing to hide, but have condemned the
latest inquiry as 'partisan', pointing to the coincidence that it took place
only hours after a ceremony in the same building at which Mr Pierre Mauroy
handed over of the job of party first secretary to Mr Laurent Fabius, a
former prime minister.
The inquiry centred on the office of the party treasurer, Mr Henri
Emmanuelli, ironically focusing party support on the formerly unpopular
selection of Mr Emmanuelli to succeed Mr Fabius as leader of the national
assembly.
Opposition parties have reacted with restraint to the inquiry, conscious of
the fact that the spotlight could also fall on them.
Mr Francois Bayrou, general secretary of the centre-right UDF, said: 'There
is no political commentary to make . . . . when a judge does his work in a
dispassionate manner.'
