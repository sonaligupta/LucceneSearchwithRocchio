FT  08 NOV 94 / Observer: Psittacosis


Poor Prince Charles. If he hadn't already enough to face from Diana and the
UK tabloid press, now he's having to spend a week in Hong Kong in the
company of the world's environmentalists.
He arrived in Hong Kong at the weekend from Los Angeles, and yesterday
complained about jet lag and having 'to stand on a rostrum with your mouth
feeling like the inside of a parrot's cage'.
Airline food is bad; but that bad?
