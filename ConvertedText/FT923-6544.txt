FT  24 AUG 92 / More building society branch cuts forecast


   By DAVID BARCHARD


FURTHER BUILDING society branches might be shut following the planned
closure of 10 out of 245 branches of the Britannia, a building society
executive warned yesterday.
The Britannia closures, which will mean the loss of about 150 jobs, were
announced at the weekend. The society is the ninth largest.
Mr Ken Scott, marketing manager of Bristol & West, the tenth-largest
society, said he could not see how the industry could continue supporting
the current number of branches.
'The strains are very apparent everywhere,' he said. Mr Scott added that
Bristol & West itself had no plans to close any of its 186 branches.
Bradford & Bingley, the sixth-largest society, said it had closed about 12
branches this year but had done so without compulsory redundancies. It said
the situation of smaller branches was constantly under review in most large
societies.
Two of the largest societies, Halifax and Leeds Permanent, both denied
planning any branch closures.
Leeds Permanent said: 'We bit the bullet two years ago and closed 60
branches. It looks as though the recession is forcing other people to go
through the same process.'
Building society branches most at risk of closure tend to be small ones on
the edges of large towns, which act as satellites for the main local branch.
These are expensive to maintain and generate relatively little additional
income for societies.
Societies say that where closure of a small branch is inevitable because of
the need to cut costs, it is often possible to maintain it as an agency,
working for the same society but not owned by it. This reduces costs while
keeping the services available to members more or less unchanged.
