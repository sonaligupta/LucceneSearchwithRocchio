FT  22 DEC 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Inventor pieces together
the elements of a public offer


John Mott, a successful British inventor of carbon fibre sports equipment
and the device which lights up high-tech training shoes, plans to take on
Lego in the marketplace for modular construction toys.
To finance his ambitions he hopes to raise Pounds 600,000 - Pounds 490,000
after costs - from investors.
Unusually for a business at such an early stage in its development - it only
registered as a public limited company in July - Mottik International Group
is attempting to raise money by a public offer for sale.
It is even seeking to be listed under the London Stock Exchange's Rule 535,
which permits trading on a matched bargain basis.
Mottik approached venture capitalists to raise the money but says they
decided against backing the proposal because it was too risky and involved
too small an amount of finance.
John Hallworth, a partner in Birmingham stockbrokers Griffiths and Lamb
which is sponsoring the issue, says this is the first time he has tried to
obtain Rule 535 status for so young a company.
The issue of 40 per cent of Mottik's shares will go ahead even if the stock
exchange refuses approval but Rule 535 status would give the company a
higher profile and allow investors to buy and sell their shares more easily.
Hallworth is critical of the lack of openings for new businesses in the UK.
'Everyone would back the inventions they see on the Tomorrow's World
television programme if they could,' he says.
'But the stock exchange rules prevent companies listing without a three-year
record. Investors cannot get in on the period of really rapid growth.'
