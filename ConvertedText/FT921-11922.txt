FT  29 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Tecs' value for money to be reviewed


   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff


CHAIRMEN of Training and Enterprise Councils are to carry out a
value-for-money review of all training programmes administered by the 82
Tecs.
The review was suggested by members of G10, the committee which represents
Tec chairmen, at a meeting yesterday with Mr Michael Howard, the employment
secretary.
Chief executives of the Tecs had asked their chairmen to raise their
concerns over the budget proposals, which include more training for roughly
the same amount of money as last year.
Some Tecs have said this meant they could not meet the government's
guarantee of a training place for all young people who wanted one.
Tecs have complained that their Business Plans - which cover areas such as
help for small businesses - cannot be met because of government negotiators
concentrating on training in their financial allocations.
Mr Howard said that in future operating surpluses made on Tec programmes
could be used for any purpose in the Business Plan.
