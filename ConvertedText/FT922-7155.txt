Corporate Services Group, USM-quoted recruitment company, announced a
pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.13m in 1991, against a Pounds 813,000 profit in the
previous nine months. The fall was due to restructuring costs and losses in
discontinued businesses.

switch from energy to employment services, completed in 1990, CSG said the
two periods were not directly comparable.

acquisitions andreported operating profits of Pounds 30,000 (Pounds 51,000)
on turnover of Pounds 20.3m (Pounds 2.31m).
Losses per share came out at 9.2p (earnings 4.2p).
