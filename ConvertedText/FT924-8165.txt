FT  12 NOV 92 / Partnership law to change


   By ANDREW JACK


PARTNERSHIPS WILL be able to take advantage of the company voluntary
arrangements and administration procedures available under UK insolvency
law, under draft legislation issued by the government's insolvency service
yesterday.
The proposed insolvency partnership order would allow greater opportunities
to assist or rescue partnerships - such as accountancy and law firms - which
run into difficulty.
It follows lobbying to the service, which is part of the Department and
Trade and Industry, by the Society of Practitioners of Insolvency, the
leading professional body.
Voluntary arrangements and administration orders were introduced by the 1986
Insolvency Act to provide simpler or cheaper alternatives to formal court
winding-up orders for companies.
Partners currently seek individual interlocking voluntary arrangements when
they run into financial difficulties. This requires approval by all partners
on similar terms and includes provisions for partnership as well as
individual property and creditors.
This option, which will remain open, has been criticised by both insolvency
practitioners and the courts.
There were many difficulties such as anomalies in partnership law, problems
in selling partnership property and unnecessary meetings.
Comments should be received by March 12. Legislation would be put into
effect with a statutory instrument.
