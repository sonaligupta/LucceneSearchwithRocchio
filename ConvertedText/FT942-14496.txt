FT  20 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Free trade challenge cannot be met
with job instability


   From Mr PETER INGRAM


Sir, Your article, 'A fortress would be no defence' (April 15), argues that
the EU's economic viability depends on liberal trade and less distorted
labour markets. In the UK, labour market reform is regarded as having made a
positive contribution to the efficient operation of the economy. Such
'flexibility' has become synonymous with shorter job tenures, insecurity of
employment and the belief that the further removal of market restrictions
will boost productivity and provide economically consistent wages.
Further destabilisation of the UK labour market could prove
counter-productive. The future source of UK productivity growth and
competitiveness is unlikely to be reinforced by reforms which cause
insecurity and instability in the workplace. Instead, the appropriate
competitive response is to foster a functionally flexible, high
productivity, multi-skilled workforce. Where job tenures are more enduring,
employers have the opportunity to realise returns on investments in training
and human capital.
The benefits of stable interaction between management and employees lie
behind the pronounced flexibility found in Japanese firms with their
emphasis on relational contracts and long-term employment. In Britain this
flexibility has been assisted by the reform of trade unions which has
allowed management to consolidate control over workplace organisation. In
the interests of future productivity and competitiveness, the fashion for
increased instability in 'freer' labour markets should be tempered in favour
of more beneficial forms of flexibility. Seeking to compete on price with
low-wage economies is an incorrect labour market response to the free trade
challenge.
