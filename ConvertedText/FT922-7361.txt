FT  19 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: S&P reduces rating on Dollars
2bn of Alcan debt


   By ROBERT GIBBENS


   MONTREAL


STANDARD & Poor's, the US rating agency, has reduced its rating on nearly
Dollars 2bn of Alcan Aluminium's long-term debt from A to A- but left
Alcan's US commercial paper unchanged.
S&P cited Alcan's tightening cash flow due to persistently lower world
primary metal prices and market disruptions caused by Commonwealth of
Independent States exports.
Net financing needs rose in 1991 and despite cuts in capital spending and in
the cost base, Alcan's debt leverage may rise in 1992, S&P said.
Aluminum Co of America's senior debt is rated as A, though S&P said all its
ratings were under continuous review.
