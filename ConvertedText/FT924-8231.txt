FT  12 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Fresh provisions push Regalian to Pounds
21m loss


   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent


A FRESH set of provisions against falling property values pushed Regalian
Properties into a pre-tax loss of Pounds 21.5m for the six months to
September 30.
The result, which compares with a profit of Pounds 6.42m for the same period
last year, followed a loss of Pounds 26.8m for the year to March 31.
Mr David Goldstone, chairman and chief executive, was pessimistic about
prospects for the second half.
'The approach of the traditionally quiet winter months and no immediate
prospect of restoration of consumer con-fidence, no upturn in the market,
nor significant improvement in trading during the second half of the
financial year is envisaged,' Mr Goldstone said.
The Pounds 18.3m provisions against falling property values largely referred
to a luxury block of flats in Kensington Palace Gardens, west London.
The company is attempting to sell the block in its entirety through an offer
for sale.
These provisions, together with a Pounds 5.35m loss on the sale of fixed
assets and other items, resulted in an exceptional charge of Pounds 24.5m.
This offset an operating profit of Pounds 3m (Pounds 6.42m).
Borrowings fell sharply from Pounds 130m to Pounds 66m.
Regalian's last set of accounts were qualified because of the auditors'
concern about the value of its property, particularly the Kensington Palace
Gardens flats and a Paddington development site.
Mr Goldstone said disposal of the flats would provide the basis of future
profitability.
'Residential refurbishment opportunities are available which, even at
current house prices, would give rise to significant return on capital for
those developers with cash resources and the expertise which Regalian
retains,' he said.
Net assets per share, adjusted for the effects of a rights issue in July
1991, fell from 104.8p to 88.58p.
