FT  13 APR 94 / US policy switch on economic reform


   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor

The US has mapped out a marked shift in its approach to economic reform in
Latin America, laying increased emphasis on government action.
Mr Lawrence Summers, Treasury under-secretary for international affairs,
told the Inter-American Development Bank annual meeting in Guadalajara
yesterday that the central challenge for the region in the next decade was
making government a constructive force. 'Markets alone, without government
action, cannot bring the shared prosperity that we crave,' he said.
This was 'the core idea that animates Bill Clinton's presidency' and 'should
be the top of any agenda for Latin America and the Caribbean today.'
The Bush administration's approach emphasised market-oriented reform, laying
little emphasis on the role of the government. Mr Summers said there had
been important progress towards disinflation, deregulation, divestiture of
government enterprises and reducing debt, but now work had to be done to
create effective government.
He emphasised the importance of strong enforcement of legitimate laws and
supported the IADB's new efforts to promote judicial reform.
Again reflecting the Clinton administration's domestic concerns, Mr Summers
also called on the IADB to help restructure labour laws 'to ensure stronger,
more independent labour unions,' to protect workers' rights, including
minimum standards for health and safety, and to rewrite and enforce
environmental protection laws.
Mr Summers later told journalists that the new emphasis 'does not represent
any abandonment of our commitment to the private sector or to the key role
the private sector has to play as the engine of growth'.
He described regional development banks, such as the IADB, as 'as important
to the new world order as the regional security organisations were to the
old one'.
