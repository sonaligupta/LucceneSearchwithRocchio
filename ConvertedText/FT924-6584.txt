FT  20 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Redundancy costs cut Clydesdale


   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent


CLYDESDALE BANK, the Glasgow-based subsidiary of National Australia Bank,
saw its pre-tax profits fall by Pounds 5m to Pounds 59m for the year to
September 30.
Operating profit was 13 per cent higher at Pounds 67.4m (Pounds 64m),
despite a jump from Pounds 28.9m to Pounds 37.4m in provisions for bad and
doubtful debts.
The pre-tax figure was after exceptional charges of Pounds 8.4m to cover
redundancy costs.
A year ago the bank, which was bought in 1987 from Midland Bank, began to
shed 700 jobs at its Glasgow head office as new technology came into use.
Staff numbers have fallen by a total of 530 to a little less than 7,000,
half through redundancies and the rest by natural wastage.
Sir David Nickson, who last December succeeded Sir Eric Yarrow as chairman,
described the results as 'not unsatisfactory' in the 'worst worldwide
economic recession since the 1930s'.
But Mr Charles Love, who recently took over as chief executive from Mr
Richard Cole-Hamilton, said he did not expect recovery in the Scottish
economy until 1994. 'There are no green shoots in Scotland.'
Mr Cole-Hamilton, who leaves the bank at the end of the year, said that bad
debt provisions accounting for 0.88 per cent of total lending compared well
with other banks. Clydesdale, which operates mainly in Scotland, had steered
clear of problems in the City of London, but 'the recession has gone on too
long for a lot of our customers in Scotland'.
Staff costs rose by 1 per cent, while other costs went up by 4 per cent. The
cost/income ratio was static at 67 per cent including the exceptional item,
but fell to 64.5 per cent without it. Total assets grew 12 per cent to
Pounds 5.7bn.
Mr Love, formerly chief executive of TSB Bank Scotland, said that he saw
opportunities for the Clydesdale to 'leverage in' lessons from the parent
company.
He wanted to fill holes in the bank's coverage of the Scottish market by
developing a greater presence in the east of the country. Its strengths at
the moment are in the Glasgow area and around Aberdeen.
