FT  30 JUN 93 / Survey of Italy (13): Searching look at monopolies - Now
media ownership is being investigated


   By HAIG SIMONIAN


JUST as some Milanese journalists thought the corruption scandal might be
dying down, a new line of inquiry has emerged to keep judges and the press
occupied.
This time, the magistrates eyes have focused on the media. In an unexpected
twist, investigations on the allocation of valuable television broadcasting
frequencies have presented magistrates with a fruitful line of inquiry.
This issue has rekindled interest in the whole question of press and media
ownership in Italy. In few other countries is the press so closely attached
to big business and the relationship so slavishly reflected in editorial
policy.
Until last year, Italian law posed few limits on ownership of newspapers,
magazines and even broadcasting, allowing a free-for-all with few parallels
in the developed world. Though restrictions have now been imposed, they are
relatively loose compared with other European countries.
Proprietorial interference is regularly denied by all media sectors, in
spite of most leading newspapers and news magazines invariably reflecting
their owners' opinions. Arch-rivals Carlo De Benedetti and Silvio Berlusconi
recently have been using their publications for a long-distance slanging
match. Born out of differing views on the economy, it has developed into a
tit-for-tat campaign of 'revelations' about alleged involvements in the
corruption scandal.
The battle has encouraged a form of investigative journalism not common in
Italy by pitching talented editorial teams against each other. La
Repubblica, the De Benedetti-controlled daily, is the best source of
information on alleged misdemeanours of Mr Berlusconi's Fininvest company,
while Panorama, the Berlusconi-controlled weekly, has specialised in
'exposes' on the De Benedetti group.
The magistrates' inquiries have also taken the lid off another highly
controversial aspect of media policy - the so-called Mammi law of the late
1980s, which attempted to impose order on the chaotic world of broadcasting.
Here too, the focus is on Mr Berlusconi. The law, named after Mr Oscar
Mammi, a former posts and telecommunications minister, sanctified
Fininvest's control of Italy's three leading private television channels - a
position many think places too much power in Mr Berlusconi's hands. But
earlier this month, the new Ciampi government ordered a revision of the law.
Foremost among the law's critics are Italy's newspaper proprietors, who
claim Fininvest has used its strong position in TV broadcasting to take too
large a slice of the overall advertising cake.
The proprietors' criticisms backed by energetic lobbying has been influenced
by the downturn in advertising during the recession. Though advertising
revenues have fallen by less than 10 per cent for most newspapers in the
past year, preliminary figures for this year suggest the drop is much
sharper, with smaller regional papers being hardest hit.
Added to Mr Berlusconi's troubles is the Italian authorities' plan to impose
tough new rules on the use of advertising slots in sponsored TV shows. The
'breaks' - most common in the game shows pioneered by Fininvest channels -
are an important source of revenue for the group. Typically, a show host
cuts away from the contestants and scantily-clad show girls to extol the
virtues of a sponsor's products. Fininvest claims curbs on breaks could cost
it about L400bn a year.
Fininvest's recent named association in the corruption scandal has also
exacerbated matters for Mr Berlusconi's group. But it need hardly be
embarrassed by the company it keeps. Other large companies with media
interests, such as Fiat, Olivetti (controlled by Mr De Benedetti's Cir
group) Ferruzzi and Eni, have already made their debuts before the
magistrates for a variety of alleged kickbacks to politicians.
The allegations of Fininvest's involvement in the corruption scandal come at
a particularly sensitive time. The signing of a lucrative L420m contract by
Mr Davide Giacalone, a consultant who helped Mr Mammi draft the original
broadcasting rules, with Fininvest has come to light.
Fininvest says the contract with Mr Giacalone was entirely above board and
the renumeration reasonable for his level of expertise.
The company has also responded to criticisms of its alleged media monopoly.
It says in observing the Mammi law it has given up control of its three
pay-TV channels for a minority stake. It has also sold Il Giornale, a
highly-regarded Milan daily paper - though significantly, ownership passed
to Mr Berlusconi's brother, Paolo. And its 45 per cent audience share of the
three Fininvest TV channels is no higher than that of other single private
television operators abroad, it claims
Focus on the media has come at a time of unprecedented commercial ferment in
the industry. Financial difficulties at Ferruzzi, the big private-sector
industrial group, could soon put its newspaper (Il Messaggero) and national
TV channel (Telemontecarlo) on the block. And Eni, the public-sector energy
and chemicals group, has said Il Giorno, its Milan-based daily newspaper, is
to be sold.
Finding buyers in a recession will not be easy. The international media boom
of the mid-80s, which saw the arrival of huge cross-border takeovers, has
long gone and many of the big media groups which grew through acquisitions
are focusing on debt reduction.
Italian buyers could also prove difficult to find. The handful of very big
companies such as Pirelli, have traditionally eschewed media interests and
show no sign of changing their minds. Although their are indications that
some smaller entrepreneurs could be interested, the assets likely to be for
sale represent too big a mouthful for most of Italy's small-to-medium sized
businesses leaders.
But it is possible that bankers may try to assemble consortia of investors
for some of the assets up for disposal. This is a solution being considered
for Il Giorno, Eni's Milan-based newspaper. Otherwise, proprietors may find
themselves holding on to media assets for longer than hoped.
