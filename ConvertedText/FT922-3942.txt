FT  09 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Fishing curbs 'may not be extended'


    By DAVID OWEN


THE GOVERNMENT does not intend extending restrictions on the number of days
that fishing boats may spend at sea to vessels under 10 metres in length
'unless it were necessary,' Mr David Curry, fisheries minister, said
yesterday, David Owen writes.
He said the Sea Fish (Conservation) Bill would give him the power to do so.
'We have to build information about the behaviour of the under-10-metre
fleet,' he said.
The measure, which received its second Commons reading yesterday, would
restrict time at sea for some 3,800 vessels over 10 metres in length and
increase sharply the maximum penalty for breaching a fishing licence
condition.
The bill received a cool welcome both from Labour and some Tory
backbenchers, in spite of Mr Curry's warnings about the importance of fish
conservation to the industry's viability.
Mr David Harris, the Conservative MP for St Ives expressed 'the greatest
reservations' about the measure and said he would not be supporting it.
'Fishermen from other countries will continue fishing while our boats are
tied up,' he claimed.
For Labour, Mr Elliott Morley, a frontbench fisheries spokesman, described
the measure as 'the sea fish crisis management bill' and said restricting
fishing hours was 'a bureaucratic way of dealing with the problem of
overcapacity in our fleet'.
'There is no actual guarantee that a bill like this is going to be genuinely
a conservation measure,' he said, calling for a 'properly funded' vessel
decommissioning scheme.
He branded the government's planned Pounds 25m scheme 'a real tiddler' and
predicted that it would produce a reduction in capacity of approximately 3
per cent.
