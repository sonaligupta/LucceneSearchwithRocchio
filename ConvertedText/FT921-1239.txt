FT  25 MAR 92 / International Company News: Sun Micro reduces workstation
prices


   By LOUISE KEHOE


SUN Microsystems Computer, the leading US computer workstation manufacturer,
yesterday cut the prices of its high-end workstations for three-dimensional
imaging by nearly 30 per cent.
The move is expected to pressure competitors, including Hewlett-Packard,
Digital Equipment, International Business Machines, and Silicon Graphics -
which specialises in 3-D workstations - into making similar price
adjustments. Sun claimed that fully-configured models of its SPARCstation
2GS and SPARCstation 2GT were now among the cheapest 3-D solids workstations
in their class.
'We believe that lower prices will help us in an important quest: broadening
the market for 3-D graphics,' said Mr Larry Hambly, vice-president of
marketing.
Sun also cut prices on 19-inch monitors for all its workstations. Prices of
add-on memory were also cut.
The company also announced price reductions on its server products. These
are computers used to provide additional computer power to networks of
workstations.
Intel, the US semiconductor group, has named Mr Ed Masi to the new post of
president of its supercomputer systems division. He is also being
recommended for election as an Intel corporate vice-president at the next
board meeting.
Mr Masi had been executive vice-president of sales, service and marketing
for Cray Research.
