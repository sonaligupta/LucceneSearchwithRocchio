FT  21 JUL 94 / Major's Reshuffle: Portillo shift a sinister omen, says
Labour


   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent


Labour was yesterday putting a brave face on the government reshuffle, which
was derided by party leaders as a largely cosmetic exercise.
Labour officials said the prime minister's failure to sack Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, would
fatally undermine his hopes that the government could make a fresh start.
'Most people won't notice any difference,' a senior official said. 'John
Major has promoted a few new faces who will give us a few new phrases, but
there will be no changes in policy.
'The only real difference is the promotion of Michael Portillo to the
employment department, which is a significant and sinister move to the right
in that area.'
Labour strategists are relaxed about the promotion of the articulate and
tough-minded trio of Mr Jonathan Aitken, Dr Brian Mawhinney and Mr Stephen
Dorrell, all accomplished parliamentary performers.
However, the reshuffle increases the likelihood of a wide-ranging shake-up
on the opposition front bench when MPs return to Westminster in October
after the summer recess.
Mr Tony Blair, who will almost certainly be crowned Labour leader today in
succession to John Smith, will delay his reshuffle until the autumn to allow
time for fresh elections to the shadow cabinet.
The most likely casualty is Mrs Ann Taylor, the shadow education secretary,
who is thought by many Labour MPs to have performed poorly, even against Mr
John Patten, who was sacked by Mr Major yesterday.
There was less certainty about other potential changes, although Mrs
Margaret Beckett, the interim party leader, is regarded as a strong
candidate to replace Mr Blair as shadow home secretary if she fails to win
either leadership post.
