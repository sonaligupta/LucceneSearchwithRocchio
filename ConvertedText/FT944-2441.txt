FT  16 DEC 94 / Tunnel shuttle service to start


Passenger shuttle services through the Channel tunnel will start next
Thursday - 18 months later than initially planned - after the award
yesterday of a safety certificate to Eurotunnel, the tunnel operator. This
will complete the tunnel's range of services.
The level of fares to be charged will be announced today. They are expected
to be comparable with ferry fares.
