FT  04 SEP 93 / Call to turn away from Maastricht


   By ARIANE GENILLARD


MR Edmund Stoiber, the prime minister of Bavaria and a key ally of
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, yesterday urged Mr Kohl to abandon his fervent
support for a fast-track European integration under the Maastricht treaty
because it risks alienating voters.
In an letter to the chancellor published in the conservative newspaper die
Welt, Mr Stoiber warned that 'the majority of voters could no longer be won
by assuming their general creed towards Europe'.
'The fatigue of citizens towards Europe threatens to expand into a rejection
of certain developments in the European community,' Mr Stoiber warned.
The letter comes as his Christian Social Union launches into open battle
with rival far-right Republicans ahead of municipal elections in Bavaria at
the end of the month and with state elections due next spring.
The Republicans, who are strongest in Germany's southern states, believe
they will enter the federal parliament next year by tapping into growing
anti-Maastricht feelings.
'I believe the development of Europe as a state parallel to or above
European states, which you are pushing for, is the wrong way and could
destroy the process of European integration rather than cement it,' the
Bavarian premier wrote.
Mr Stoiber welcomed the chancellor's suggestion that European monetary union
could be delayed 'by a year or two' as a result of the virtual collapse of
the exchange rate mechanism.
The Bavarian premier said he opposed a single European currency as 'much too
ambitious'.
Mr Stoiber repeated his demand for greater powers for the European
parliament. He urged Germany to open a debate at the October EC summit on
reforming EC institutions to make them more transparent and accountable.
