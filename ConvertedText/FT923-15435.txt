AUSTRALIAN Gas Light (AGL), the Sydney-based fuel supplier, has joined the
growing list of Australian companies writing down the value of their assets
in depressed market conditions.
Following blue-chip Australian groups like CSR, Western Mining and Westpac
AGL has written down property and pipeline assets by ADollars 33.8m.(
Dollars 25.40m).
AGL directors said yesterday ADollars 15.5m of this sum would be taken as an
abnormal loss in the June 30 accounts, with the balance of ADollars 18.3m as
a charge against assets. The write-downs are based on independent valuations
which followed property sales in the latest June year totalling ADollars
53m.
Burns Philp, the Sydney-based food technology company, has signed an
agreement to increase its interest in Applied Microbiology, the US
biotechnology company, from 18 to 63 per cent for an undisclosed sum.
Based on recent quotations on Nasdaq in New York of USDollars 4.75 a share
for Applied, the deal would be worth about USDollars 44.2m.
As part of the transaction Applied will acquire all outstanding shares in
Burns Philp's UK-based preservative maker, Aplin & Barrett, for a value of
ADollars 53m.
