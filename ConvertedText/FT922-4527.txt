FT  05 JUN 92 / People: Tokyo to London for Paribas


Denis Antoine, French investment bank Paribas' top man in Tokyo, has arrived
in London to head up the UK operation in succession to Francois de Rancourt.
de Rancourt, 53, had been in London not quite two years before he was called
back to Paris as Controleur General, effectively in charge of credit policy
for the whole group.
The long-term debt of Paribas was recently downgraded by Standard & Poor's,
the US rating agency, largely due to a sharp increase in loan-loss
provisions. So de Rancourt's new role is a particularly crucial one for the
bank at this point.
Antoine's relocation to London adds another important dimension to a firmly
international career. He will be running an operation of some 500 people on
the capital markets side, and a slimmed down 150 at the branch - compared
with 150 in total in Tokyo.
Aged 46, Antoine had been in Japan since 1983, and has a Japanese wife.
In London, Paribas has fared better than many international banks, managing
to counterbalance exposure to the dismal recession-bound UK corporate market
with notable successes in equity sales and research and in derivatives
products, including swaps.
One priority for Antoine will be to continue integrating banking and capital
market services. Paribas is aiming to set up a more cohesive marketing front
worldwide - or, as some analysts would say, looking to break down rival
fiefdoms.
With Tokyo and New York already ahead of London in this respect, Antoine
will be perfectly familiar with the process.
