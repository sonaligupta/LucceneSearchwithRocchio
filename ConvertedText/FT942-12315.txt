FT  29 APR 94 / US spy sentenced to life in prison


   By REUTER


   ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA


Former CIA officer Mr Aldrich Ames and his wife Rosario pleaded guilty
yesterday to spying for Moscow in one of the most damaging espionage cases
in US history, Reuter reports from Alexandria, Virginia. He was sentenced to
life in prison.
Under a plea-bargain agreement, Mr Ames, 52, accepted the life term without
chance of parole and promised to co-operate fully with investigators in
return for lenient treatment for his wife.
Mr Ames, who served as head of a Soviet counter-intelligence desk in the
1980s, revealed that he had given the KGB Soviet intelligence agency the
names of every Soviet citizen he knew who was working for the US as a spy.
He admitted he was paid about Dollars 2.5m for his espionage work.
US District Court Judge Claude Hilton delayed sentencing Mrs Ames, 42, until
August 26 while prosecutors assess the extent of her husband's co-operation.
The government and Mrs Ames's lawyer agreed to recommend that she be
sentenced to serve five to six years without parole, the Justice Department
said.
After the hearing the couple, shackled in chains, were escorted back to
prison from the federal courthouse in Alexandria, a suburb across the
Potomac river from Washington where the hearing took place.
In an eight-page statement he read to the court, Mr Ames said: 'I bitterly
regret the catastrophe which my betrayal of trust has brought upon my wife
and son and any who have loved and cared for me. No punishment by this court
can balance or ease the profound shame and guilt I bear.'
He expressed sympathy for 'those persons in the former Soviet Union or
elsewhere who may have suffered.'
US government officials believe at least 10 citizens of the former Soviet
Union and allied communist states were executed as a result of Mr Ames's
betrayal.
