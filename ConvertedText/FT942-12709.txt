FT  28 APR 94 / Observer: Exit, chased by dragons


After less than two years in his highly lucrative post, Hong Kong governor
Chris Patten is showing distinct signs of itchy feet. Surely he's not pining
for the grey skies of Britain already?
One cannot blame him for being a bit browned off. Chinese government
officials more or less refuse to have anything to do with him these days;
when Lu Ping, China's top official on Hong Kong affairs, comes to town next
week, he won't even be seeing Patten.
No wonder, then, that the wily Brit has been saying for the past month or so
that, as 1997 approaches, he will be adopting more of a ceremonial role -
letting his top officials make the running in promoting government policy.
Ahem.
The truth is Patten never really lost his love of Westminster. He stays
remarkably well-informed about the progress of friend and foe alike, and
takes every opportunity to return to Britain for increasingly leisurely
sojourns. Next month, as well as addressing the Manchester Philosophical
Society, he has made sure to take in a performance at renovated Glyndebourne
opera house.
He has also given up disclaiming any interest in a return to the British
political scene. Nowadays he just throws the question back, asking under
what circumstances he might make a comeback. Glumly, he says he does not
believe a credible scenario exists.
Why he should be upset by that, given the government's manifold troubles, is
another question.
