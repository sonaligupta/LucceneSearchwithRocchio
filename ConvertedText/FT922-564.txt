FT  26 JUN 92 / Bomb explodes outside City bank


   By RICHARD TOMKINS


TERRORIST bombers hit the City of London last night, disrupting travel but
causing no injuries.
The bomb went off just before 8pm outside the London headquarters of the
Chase Manhattan Bank in Woolgate House, Coleman Street, off Moorgate. It had
been left in a briefcase under a white Mercedes car.
City of London police were alerted by a security guard who noticed the
suspect briefcase and dialled 999 about five minutes before the bomb went
off.
They were clearing the area and about to search for the device when it
exploded.
Windows were blown out of Woolgate House and an nearby car was damaged, but
there were no injuries. The bomb was believed to contain about 2lbs of high
explosive.
Commander Hugh Moore of the City of London Police said the latest attack
bore the hallmarks of the IRA.
It was also typical of latest IRA diversionary tactics to accompany
explosions with hoax calls.
About 10 minutes after the explosion, a man with an Irish accent telephoned
the BBC claiming to be an IRA member and using a known code and saying where
the bomb had been placed.
The caller said four other bombs had been planted in central London and were
timed to go off 15 minutes later, but police did not find any other devices.
Many streets in the City of London were sealed off for several hours to
ensure that no other devices had been left. There was also disruption at
other locations, including King's Cross, as searches were made.
One Barbican resident said: 'The explosion was incredibly loud and
spectacular and sent a plume of black smoke 300 yards into the air.'
It appeared to have caused little damage to surrounding buildings.
Ten weeks ago the IRA bombed the Baltic Exchange in the City, killing three
people, injuring 91, and causing millions of pounds worth of damage.
