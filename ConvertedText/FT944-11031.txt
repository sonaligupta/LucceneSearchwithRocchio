FT  08 NOV 94 / UK Company News: ABF held back by fall in investment income


   By DAVID BLACKWELL


A sharp fall in investment income depressed profits at Associated British
Foods, the milling, baking, and sugar group which was restructured earlier
this year in order to improve tax planning at the Weston family trusts that
control the company.
Pre-tax profits for the 52 weeks to September 17 fell to Pounds 324m,
against Pounds 338m for the 53 weeks to September 18 1993.
Fluctuating bond and gilt prices knocked the returns on investments of about
Pounds 700m down from 11.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent, yielding income of just
Pounds 21m compared with Pounds 83m last time.
Mr Garry Weston, chairman, described the 1993 returns on the gilt portfolio
as 'exceptional', while the low point in the market had been reached at the
end of the group's latest financial year.
Turnover of Pounds 4.48bn was slightly ahead of the previous Pounds 4.39bn,
but was effectively flat given that the 1993 figures covered 53 weeks.
Mr Weston said the markets for bread and sugar were still 'pretty tough  -
go in any supermarket and they will be on sale below cost'. Nevertheless the
group lifted operating profits from Pounds 273m to Pounds 306m.
It was defending its market position by continually improving efficiency and
introducing new products with better margins, he said.
UK manufacturing increased profits by 11 per cent to Pounds 222m.
Rationalisation costs were Pounds 3m lower at Pounds 13m. At British Sugar
profits advanced to Pounds 167m on a lower harvest.
After allowing for dividend payments last month, net cash was Pounds 610m at
the year-end, up Pounds 109m. Capital expenditure remained steady at Pounds
200m.
In addition to the investment income the pre-tax figure included Pounds 4m
from property disposals (unchanged from the previous year) and Pounds 23m
(Pounds 12m) from the group's investment in Berisford International.
Interest payable fell from Pounds 34m to Pounds 30m. The tax charge was
reduced by Pounds 35m, reflecting reassessment of previous Berisford losses.
The group paid Pounds 63m (Pounds 104m).
Consequently earnings per share were sharply ahead at 56.7p, compared with
50.7p last time.
A final dividend of 7.5p (6.5p) is proposed, giving a total for the year of
16p (15p).
COMMENT
After the feast in the bond market last year it was only to be expected that
famine would follow. While 1.5 per cent can only be described as an
appalling return, better times are likely to reappear this year. The
operating profits were better than expected, reflecting the continued drive
to control costs. This is necessary given the supermarkets' propensity to
offer discounts on white loaves. There should be some benefits from the
acquisition of Bibby's agricultural feeds operation last April, and the
group continues to churn out the cash. Even with an upturn in investment
income, earnings this year will be lower as the tax charge returns to
normal. The City is expecting about 51p a share, giving a prospective
multiple of 11 - nothing to get excited about.
