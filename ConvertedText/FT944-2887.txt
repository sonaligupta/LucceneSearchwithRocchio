FT  15 DEC 94 / International Company News: Japan grants trading licence to
UK broker


   By GERARD BAKER


   TOKYO


Japan's finance ministry yesterday issued a licence for a Tokyo branch of a
British securities subsidiary to operate in Japanese financial markets,
writes Gerard Baker in Tokyo.
Instinet Japan, which will begin trading early next year, is capitalised at
Pounds 5m (Dollars 7.8m) and currently employs 13 people. The company is
wholly-owned by the London-based broker Thamesway Investment Services, which
is in turn part of the Reuters group of financial companies.
Although the licence permits Instinet to trade both equities and fixed
interest securities, the company said it intended to concentrate on the
stock market, where its focus will be exclusively on institutional sales.
The Japanese equity market is currently suffering from acute lack of demand
and excess supply. Instinet plans to supplement its domestic Japanese
business by selling other Asian and European equities in Tokyo.
The company's arrival in Tokyo brings the total of foreign brokers operating
in Japan to 66 branches of 49 securities companies, the ministry said.
