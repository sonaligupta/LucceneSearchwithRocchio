FT  29 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Prospect of Bundesbank rate
cut lifts bourses


   By Our Markets Staff


INTEREST rate hopes ahead of Thursday's Bundesbank meeting moved a number of
bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT was accused of window dressing as the DAX index rose another 11.96
to 1,707.20, a good 20 points over its March 31 level. Turnover rose from
DM6.0bn to DM6.1bn. Analysts, meanwhile, argued about the distribution of
share price rises and falls over the past three months.
The most obvious DAX strong points were the carmakers, BMW and Volkswagen.
BMW rose DM7.60 to DM517.80, up nearly 9 per cent over the past three
months; VW's DM10.70 gain to DM369.50 - based on a bullish magazine report,
strength in the yen and the dollar and a break above a key chart level -
left it with gains of 21 per cent since last March 31, and 52 per cent since
the end of last year.
'We have seen this before,' said Mr Bob Barber, the top automotive industry
analyst at James Capel in London, 'and it's all ended in tears.' Mr Barber
said that the car makers had seen an upswing like this in 1990 and 1992, but
that the fundamentals were now much worse than in those two years.
Elsewhere, other cyclical groups like chemicals and engineers were broadly
higher, while banks were relatively weak. Lufthansa continued its rally,
gaining DM5.40 or 4.7 per cent to DM120.80. While the firm dollar certainly
plays a role in the airline's climb, analysts said, the possibility of
improved Atlantic routes drove yesterday's trading.
MILAN remained nervous as the market awaited the outcome of talks between
the government and employers on a wage accord. However, after the close,
Confindustria, the main employers organisation, said that there had been no
progress, although a further round of negotiations could take place
tomorrow.
The Comit index closed up 5.91 or 1.1 per cent at 540.34.
Montedison, whose shares, along with those of its parent, Ferruzzi, were
suspended early on, provided further disappointing news at its annual
meeting yesterday when it announced that it had lifted its 1992 consolidated
net loss from a previously stated L1,244bn to L1,679bn.
Fiat gave some support to the market, although easing on the kerb to L6,410,
having fixed L152 higher at L6,451. However, telecommunications issues again
performed well, with Stet up L55 to L3,425 and Sip L62 higher at L2,541.
AMSTERDAM registered another good gain on the day, with a rise in the CBS
Tendency index of 1.2 to 112.7, as some cyclical stocks attracted investors.
Optimism that the Bundesbank could cut interest rates at its meeting on
Thursday also supported sentiment.
As Smith New Court notes in its latest European strategy document, the Dutch
market 'is benefiting from safe-haven status in Europe at a time when
earnings estimates in the other, more cyclical, markets are disappointing'.
The brokers believe that this market will remain attractive until monetary
policy is aggressively eased in France and Germany.
Philips moved to a new year's high, up 20 cents to Fl 29.40, while Royal
Dutch put on Fl 1.50 to Fl 176.60 and Heineken Fl 1.70 to Fl 182.80.
Among cyclicals Hoogovens improved Fl 1.60 to Fl 34.80, VNU by Fl 1.50 to Fl
116.40 and KNP BT by 80 cents to Fl 31.70.
PARIS rose on technical trading ahead of tomorrow's expiry of options and
futures contracts. The CAC-40 index gained 30.11 or 1.5 per cent to 1,990.95
in heavy turnover of FFr6.7bn.
A number of block trades helped to swell volume, with some 500,000 in Elf
going through as the shares gained FFr12 to FFr402. Alcatel also saw large
volume and the shares gained FFr6 to FFr661.
ZURICH was led higher by banks in good volume as the SMI index rose 21.8 to
2,369.70. Signs of easing interest rates in Switzerland and elsewhere in
Europe were one stimulus to the financials, and the increasing flow of cash
out of fixed interest markets was another.
In banks, CS Holding gained SFr40 to SFr2,680. However, the day's most
active stock was Nestle as it approached the end of rights trading, and the
underlying shares rose SFr19 to SFr1,146.
BRUSSELS saw the Bel-20 index hit an all-time high in early trade ahead of
late profit-taking, to close up 2.91 at 1,268.41.
STOCKHOLM was lifted by advances in a number of blue chip stocks, as the
Affarsvarlden general index put on 13.70 to 1,080.40. Ericcson B's gained
SKr9 to SKr335, a new year's high. after the group told investors in the US
that it expected a substantial increase in 1993 earnings.
HELSINKI added 2.7 per cent to the HEX index at 1,138.0, on gains in the
forestry sector, while COPENHAGEN's KFX index moved up 2.1 per cent to 91.08
on institutional buying.
VIENNA climbed by nearly 1 per cent on hopes of a cut in German interest
rates, the ATX index rising 7.34 to 860.53. Cyclical stocks were among the
leaders, with Veitscher gaining Sch14 to Sch258 and its parent company,
Radex, up Sch8 to Sch336.
DUBLIN's ISEQ overall index was driven higher by financials, 2.9 per cent
better on the day, as it closed 26.04 higher at 1,602.93, trading on the
prospect of further domestic rate cuts and a good outlook for the Irish
economy.
TEL AVIV closed sharply lower for its sixth consecutive losing session. The
Mishtanim blue chip index fell 5.21 or 2.7 per cent to 187.02 after a 2 per
cent fall on Sunday, reflecting heavy sales by both private investors and
mutual funds. However, a government decision not to impose a capital gains
tax on the stock exchange was expected to help share prices today.
