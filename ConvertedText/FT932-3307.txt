FT  15 JUN 93 / Business and the Law: Esop model deed - Legal briefs


The UK's Esop Centre has published a standard trust deed for case-law
employee share ownership plans (as opposed to statutory Esops established
under the 1989 Finance Act) which are used by quoted companies mainly in
order to acquire in advance shares which will be needed over the years for
employee share schemes. The deed was drafted by Robin Tremaine, a tax
partner with Clifford Chance. The model deed has Inland Revenue approval.
