FT  24 MAR 92 / National Gallery bids for Holbein painting


THE National Gallery said last night that it had made a bid for Holbein's
painting Lady with a Pet Squirrel and a Starling, which was due to go to
auction next month. The work was expected to make up to Pounds 15m at
Christie's, and could have become the most expensive Old Master sold at
auction in the UK.
The gallery said it had made an offer to the Marquess of Cholmondeley, the
owner, for a private-treaty deal, in which the vendor does not have to pay
the tax or commission involved in an auction sale, so that a lower price can
be agreed.
The Museums and Galleries Commission, which advises the government, said it
was delighted that the painting might go to the gallery instead of being
sold at auction, possibly to an overseas buyer.
The commission said that the marquess might have received only Pounds 5m or
Pounds 6m if the picture had reached Pounds 15m in an auction.
