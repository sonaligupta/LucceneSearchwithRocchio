FT  21 OCT 92 / International Company News: Allianz sees increase in
turnover to DM52bn

TURNOVER at Allianz, the largest insurance group in Europe, will rise from
DM48.7bn last year to more than DM52bn (Dollars 36.8bn) this year, the
Munich-based company said yesterday as it announced half-year figures.
However, a number of factors, including Hurricane Andrew in the US as well
as an explosion of car theft in Germany, will ensure that mainstream
insurance business - before taking into account investment income - will
make losses this year for the second year in a row.
Profits from the group's investment activities - the book value alone of its
investments stands in excess of DM150bn - will compensate for the
underwriting loss on pure insurance business, meaning that overall profits
will be 'clearly positive', Allianz said yesterday.
As a result, the dividend for the current year will be held at the same
level as for 1991, at DM13.50 per share, Allianz said as it unveiled premium
income up by 5.1 per cent to DM27.4bn in the first six months of the year.
Allianz's shares have fallen a quarter from their high point in June this
year, driven downwards by disappointing 1991 figures released in late July.
Underwriting losses were DM1.78bn in 1991, compared with a profit of DM182m
in the previous year, a fact which markets chose to focus on rather than the
4 per cent increase in overall net profits to DM1.05bn. Hurricane Andrew,
which swept through a number of states in the US in August this year, is
likely to cost Allianz DM75m.
Losses at the Deutsche Versicherungs subsidiary in east Germany will improve
by DM200m this year, after DM625m last year. Domestic results have been hit
by a high level of industrial claims and a surge in car theft.
