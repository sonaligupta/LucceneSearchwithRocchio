FT  05 JUN 92 / Arts: Today's Television


   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY


Anyone over 45 will have a sense of deja vu on hearing about Channel 4's new
series A Stab In The Dark (11.10): live, late night, topical, anarchic,
taking a stab at the powerful, the privileged and the pompous, re-examining
the week's events before a studio audience. No one is actually offering a
hostage to fortune and saying 'TW3', but who needs to?
For television drama involving steam trains, enamel advertisements and Fair
Isle pullovers look to the British. But for travel through time and space
with an eerie sense of the supernatural, the Americans have always been
streets ahead: those series from the late 1950s and early 60s, 'The Outer
Limits' and The Twilight Zone were pretty consistently impressive. Today's
TZ episode, 'King Nine Will Not Return' (1.05 in the morning, C4) opened the
second season of the series in September 1960.
The pilot of a B-25 bomber comes round after a crash during WorldWar 2 to
find the grave of one of his crew, and jet aircraft flying overhead.
Bob Cummings delivers the lines of the pilot as interior monologues in
voice-over: classic, gripping, American television drama.
