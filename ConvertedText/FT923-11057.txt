FT  27 JUL 92 / Support for Mellor signalled by polls


   By DAVID OWEN


THE GOVERNMENT yester-day signalled its determination not to be rushed by
the Mellor affair into taking action to curb press freedom, saying it would
await the publication of a report on the press by Sir David Calcutt, David
Owen writes.
The message came as the position of Mr David Mellor, the national heritage
secretary, who is alleged have had an affair with an actress, appeared to be
strengthened by the findings of two opinion polls at the weekend.
A survey of 100 Tory backbenchers by the Mail on Sunday indicated that 54 of
those questioned believed that Mr Mellor should retain his post, compared
with 26 who felt he should resign and 20 who refused to comment. Only one
Tory, Mrs Ann Winterton, MP for Congleton, has publicly called for his
resignation.
A Gallup poll of the general public for the Sunday Telegraph put support for
Mr Mellor at 62 per cent and at 64 per cent among women. A total of of 1,028
people were interviewed last week. A total of 52 per cent supported
legislation to restrict press intrusion, with 38 per cent opposed.
But a number of Tory MPs including Mr Patrick Nicholls, Mr Mellor's former
parliamentary private secretary, and Ms Angela Knight, MP for Erewash, are
calling on Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, to introduce legislation
on electronic eavesdropping, if necessary before publication of the Calcutt
report.
