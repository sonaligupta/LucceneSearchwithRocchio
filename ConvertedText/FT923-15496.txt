FT  02 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Japanese liquor tax inquiry


   By ROBERT THOMSON


   TOKYO


JAPAN's National Tax Agency, concerned at a fall in liquor tax revenue, has
asked the Fair Trade Commission (FTC) to investigate 'unfair pricing' by
beer and spirit discount houses, whose networks have expanded rapidly over
the past two years.
The tax agency's request is linked to an increase in low-priced imports
outside the sole agent system, and echoes complaints by domestic producers
and foreign importers, whose profits have suffered because of the heavy
discounting.
Tax officials said the increasing flow of parallel imports and an increase
in domestic beer discounting had 'disrupted' the market and hurt liquor tax
revenues, which were more than 5 per cent lower than expected last fiscal
year.
But Japanese consumers have welcomed the discounting, as the prices of
well-known foreign spirits have plunged by as much as 50 per cent at shops
with access to parallel imports.
Meanwhile, domestic beer can be bought for 20 to 30 per cent below
recommended prices at a fast-expanding network of discount houses, which
have challenged the complex distribution systems supported by Japanese
brewers. 'As consumers, we are happy with the discounts,' a tax agency
official said, 'but, as government representatives, we have to be aware of
the impact that it is having on our society.
'The important thing is to maintain fair competition.'
The FTC will face the difficult task of determining whether the discounters
are guilty of predatory pricing or whether they are merely participants in a
newly-competitive market.
The agency, which takes Y132 (56p) on a Y320 bottle of beer, indicated
yesterday that it would prefer a return to the stability ensured by the old
domestic beer cartel and the sole agent system for imports.
