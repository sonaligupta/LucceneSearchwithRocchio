FT  26 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Williams Holdings


It seems Mr Brian McGowan, Williams Holdings' chief executive, wants to
spend more time with his fishing rod. His decision certainly suggests that
life in City mergers and acquisitions departments will continue to be dull.
It also raises awkward questions for Mr Nigel Rudd, Williams' chairman, who
is arguably even more of a fan of bids and deals. The company may say that
potential targets are too expensive and that organic growth is its chosen
route, but that is to make a virtue of necessity. Williams' lowly rating
hardly permits a paper bid while gearing constrains cash offers.
Organic growth, however, will be equally hard to come by. Many of its
businesses flower late in the economic cycle, while at a trading level cash
has flowed out of the company in each of the last three years. Above average
growth to restore the company's premium rating looks unlikely. The
uncharitable may feel that it is just as well Williams has turned its back
on contested bids, since it has failed too often. The reality is that
conglomerate sharks need to keep moving forward if they are to thrive.
