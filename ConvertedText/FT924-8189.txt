FT  12 NOV 92 / Letter: GATT negotiators would do better to talk of feeding
Third World


   From Mr RAYMOND GELY


Sir, David Dodwell's article, 'Trade war - what it means to you' (November
7), prompts me to raise a few more questions on the matter.
Mr Dodwell rightly mentions that, as far as oilseeds are concerned, the US
is the world's largest OECD producer - accounting for 63m tonnes out of a
world production of 86m tonnes and the world's biggest exporter, selling
over 18m tonnes while the EC is the world's biggest importer (14m tonnes
last year).
Do I understand that we have to accept that the US could export even more to
Europe or we would face 'sanctions'? Does it really mean that the Americans
would demand an even greater share of the world trade in that agricultural
sector, which in fact would lead to a quasi-monopoly? I learned on many
different occasions that the American or European liberals were always
strongly against trusts or monopolies.
How is it that they changed their views so drastically on this occasion?
I also wonder if the supporters of free trade feel very happy and
comfortable in promoting a policy of desertification of Europe when hundreds
of millions of people are suffering from malnutrition all around the world
and hundreds of thousands of them - mostly children - are now dying of
starvation in Africa?
Don't you think that the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiators
 -who have worked for six years already without reaching a trade agreement -
would have achieved a better end by trying to organise on a world basis the
ways and means of transferring the American and European food surplus to the
famished population of the Third World?
How is it that the governments of the rich countries to which we belong are
fighting each other on economic grounds and are not ashamed of leaving to
charity or private organisation the greater obligations we have in the world
of to-day, which is feeding the world population?
