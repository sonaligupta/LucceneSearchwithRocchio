FT  26 OCT 92 / International Company News: BBV posts fall of 19.8% to
Pta59bn in third term

BANCO Bilbao Vizcaya, the Spanish bank, reported a 19.8 per cent fall in
third-quarter net income to Pta59bn (Dollars 551m) compared with the same
period last year due to a sharp drop in extraordinary items. The group
showed a slight improvement in its banking business.
The operating margin rose by 3.1 per cent after a 13.8 per cent increase in
other ordinary revenue, chiefly fee income. Operating profit was up 4.7 per
cent to Pta101bn. At the six-month stage, the operating margin had risen by
2.8 per cent and operating profit by 3.8 per cent.
BBV implemented stringent cost-cutting which led to a 4.4 decrease in
overheads and contained the rise of trading expenses to just 2.2 per cent.
The bank said that, in contrast to elsewhere in the banking sector, doubtful
debts had risen by 'only' 3 per cent over the nine months and that loans
were up by just 3.6 per cent due to the slack demand of solvent borrowers.
The third-quarter results came as BBV sold its interests in the Kesa and Kas
soft drinks producers to PepsiCo, realising capital gains of Pta7bn which
will be accounted in the fourth quarter.
