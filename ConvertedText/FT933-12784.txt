FT  22 JUL 93 / UK Company News: CarnaudMetalbox sells Pharmaflex


CarnaudMetalbox has sold Pharmaflex, a UK pharmaceutical packaging foils
printer, to Alusuisse Lonza.
Mr Jurgen Hintz, chief executive of CarnaudMetalbox, said Pharmaflex was an
excellent business but unique of its kind in the group. It should,
therefore, find a better opportunity to develop as part of AL Packaging.
Pharmaflex is based in Newcastle. It employs 62 people and has an annual
turnover of Pounds 8m.
