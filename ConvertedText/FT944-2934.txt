Ptarmigan International Capital Trust, formerly Castle Cairn Investment
Trust, reported net income of Pounds 57,000 for the half year to November
30.
For the six months to end-December 1993 net income was Pounds 36,000, but
the company said that the results were not comparable as in March it had
changed its policy from investing only in investment trusts to investing in
individual companies. And the company had also changed its year-end.
Earnings per share amounted to 1.18p (1.24p) and an interim dividend of 1.7p
is declared.
