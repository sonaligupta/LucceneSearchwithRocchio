FT  25 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Yeoman postpones shareholder votes


   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor


YEOMAN Investment Trust has postponed for a week the shareholder votes on
plans to extend the life of the split capital trust until 1999.
The votes were deferred when it became clear that Orion Insurance, which
owns 24.1 per cent of the income shares, intended to vote against the
proposals, thus ensuring defeat for the board's plans.
Orion said it was unhappy about the level of capital cover on the revamped
income shares.
It was also concerned about the effect of corporate dividend cuts on the
trust's income stream.
Attempts will be made this week to try to place Orion's shares in the
market, before the extraordinary meetings resume on September 2.
Majorities of 75 per cent of income and capital shareholders are needed to
pass the resolutions.
Yeoman was due to be wound up this year.
Instead, under the proposals, capital shareholders were offered the chance
to convert their shares into zero dividend preference shares; up to 70 per
cent of the latter could then be realised for cash.
Income shareholders were not offered a cash exit.
