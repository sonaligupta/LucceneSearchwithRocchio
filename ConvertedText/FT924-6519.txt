FT  20 NOV 92 / Letter: Impulse for recovery programme


   From Sir ARTHUR KNIGHT


Sir, In a lecture in London on November 11, Rudi Dornbusch of Massachusetts
Institute of Technology suggested that in the absence of effective EC-wide
policies, Franco-German co-operation offers the best hope of getting 'actual
decisions'; that issues concerning the former Soviet Union should take
priority; and (in response to a question) that as a first step there should
be an approach to Moscow.
The object of the approach would be to offer a substantial cash sum (to be
provided by the Japanese) in exchange for the return to Japan of the Kurile
Islands; firm undertakings (endorsed by the parliament) to act effectively
to deal with fiscal and monetary problems; and to get on quickly with
privatisation.
That might seem a good way to strengthen the prospects for the 'joint
recovery programme' of which Edward Mortimer writes (Foreign Affairs,
November 18). Apart from political and security considerations, the early
consideration of such a programme is surely justified by the impulse to
growth which it could provide worldwide at a time when other prospects are
lacking?
