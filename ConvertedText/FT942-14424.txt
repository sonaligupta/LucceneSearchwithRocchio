FT  20 APR 94 / International Company News: Argentine food group in agreed
takeover


   By JOHN BARHAM


   BUENOS AIRES


Canale, a struggling Argentine food company, has agreed to sell 58.5 per
cent of its equity to Socma, a large locally-owned industrial conglomerate.
Buenos Aires-based Canale, which makes biscuits, pasta and jams, did not
reveal terms of the deal.
However, it is understood that Socma will pay members of the founding Canale
family between Dollars 15m and Dollars 20m for its shares, leaving the
family with 21.5 per cent of the company.
The remainder is traded on the Buenos Aires stock exchange.
Socma owns companies such as Sevel, Argentina's biggest car company.
It also has interests in services, construction and energy companies.
Analysts said Canale had suffered from poor management and fallen into debt.
It reported sales of Dollars 41m in the six months to last December, up 11
per cent over the second half of 1992.
