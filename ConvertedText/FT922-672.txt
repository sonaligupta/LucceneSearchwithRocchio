FT  26 JUN 92 / International Company News: Eurotunnel shareholders to get
first dividend in year 2000


   By WILLIAM DAWKINS


EUROTUNNEL yesterday said shareholders would get their first dividend soon
after the end of the decade, throwing uncertainty over earlier forecasts of
a pay-out in the year 2000, writes William Dawkins.
Mr Andre Benard, the French co-chairman, warned the annual meeting that cost
over-runs, changes in revenue forecasts and interest rates could alter
Eurotunnel's forecast of a profit before the end of the decade.
'In the current state of things, the payment of the first dividend will come
as soon as possible after the first profits, on condition that our
agreements with the banks allow it,' he said.
The tunnel is due to open in autumn next year, but will not be able to
provide a full rail service until summer 1994.
Technically, Eurotunnel is in breach of its bank covenants because of the
rise in the project's cost, from Pounds 4.8bn in 1987 to more than Pounds
8bn. So it can only go on drawing cash so long as the banks give waivers to
the covenant. The present waiver will keep the project going through August
and September, said Mr Benard.
