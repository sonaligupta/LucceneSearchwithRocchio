FT  16 JAN 92 / Renault defends alliance with Volvo


   By WILLIAM DAWKINS


   PARIS


RENAULT'S chairman, Mr Raymond Levy, yesterday defended the state-owned
car-maker's two-year-old alliance with Volvo in response to anxiety voiced
by the French government.
'The accord must be allowed to live', said Mr Levy, replying to a press
interview by Mr Abel Farnoux, special adviser to Mrs Edith Cresson, the
prime minister, claiming that the alliance was 'damaging to Renault, because
it is unbalanced'.
Under the alliance Volvo has a 20 per cent stake in Renault, which in turn
has taken 10 per cent of the Swedish group. Their subsidiaries have also
exchanged minority stakes.
The two factors behind the government's anxieties are the losses of Volvo's
car division  - the equivalent of FFr1.5bn (Pounds 150m) in the first nine
months of last year  - and the Swedish company's growing links with
Mitsubishi, with which it has agreed to begin joint car production in the
Netherlands.
Volvo has emphatically denied French press suggestions that it is
negotiating to sell a minority stake to Mitsubishi. However, it has
repeatedly reminded the French government that, as a minority shareholder,
it expects to be consulted on the choice of successor to Mr Levy, who is due
to retire in the summer.
The French government is unlikely to demand a big change in the
Renault-Volvo alliance. In fact, the partners are planning to strengthen
their links and have ruled nothing out, including even a possible merger.
However, the debate is exposing the disarray in several areas of French
industrial policy. The government is divided, for example, over whether to
choose IBM or Hewlett Packard as a partner for Bull, the state-owned
computer-maker, as it is over the detailed terms for a wholesale
reorganisation of the electronics and nuclear industries.
