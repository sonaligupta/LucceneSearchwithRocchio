FT  24 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Burmah's Pounds 44m sale falls well short
of early hopes


   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES


BURMAH CASTROL, the lubricants and chemicals group, has sold its ceramics,
abrasives and diamond products businesses to Apax Partners, the European
venture capital fund, for Pounds 44m.
A year ago when the businesses were put up for sale Burmah expected to raise
Pounds 70m as it thought that this year would see some economic recovery.
'We are pleased to have sold the division in such terrible trading
conditions,' it said yesterday.
The consideration was met by Pounds 41.5m cash and the assumption by Apax of
Pounds 2.5m in long-term liabilities.
Pre-tax profits for the division, which Burmah acquired with Foseco, a
speciality chemicals producer, at the end of 1990, were Pounds 6.7m last
year. However, trading conditions have deteriorated significantly during the
present year and the company said the businesses were trading at a reduced
level of activ-ity.
Burmah has almost completed the disposals envisaged when it bought Foseco in
a Pounds 259m deal. Yesterday's announcement brings the running total to
Pounds 52m and a further Pounds 5m is expected from selling UK industrial
activit-ies.
When Burmah reports its 1991 results on Thursday analysts are expecting a
fall in net income to about Pounds 70m from last year's Pounds 97m.
World oil refining margins have been depressed and the chemicals sector is
suffering from deep recession. An unchanged total dividend of 23p is
forecast.
