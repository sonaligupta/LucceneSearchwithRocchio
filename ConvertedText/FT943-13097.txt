FT  21 JUL 94 / 252 detained as strike hits Nepal


   By AGENCIES


   KATHMANDU


Nepali police yesterday detained 252 people who were enforcing a
communist-sponsored nationwide strike that paralysed the capital Kathmandu
and most of the country, agencies report from Kathmandu.
An interior ministry spokesman said demonstrators demanding that Mr Girija
Prasad Koirala, caretaker prime minister, leave office damaged 15
state-owned commuter buses, a police van and a car with Indian licence
plates in the capital. The strike brought Kathmandu to a standstill.
Mr Koirala, 70, Nepal's first democratically-elected leader in three
decades, resigned on July 10 after losing a policy vote in parliament, but
was asked by King Birendra to stay on as caretaker.
The communist-led opposition demanded that Mr Koirala leave office so that
he cannot influence the outcome of the general election scheduled for
November 13. At least 20,000 people gathered near the royal palace to back
the call.
Mr Koirala's government collapsed because of infighting in his Nepali
Congress party, but many Nepalis are also frustrated that democracy has not
done more to alleviate the country's poverty.
The opposition demands that King Birendra, who gave up his absolute powers
to become a constitutional monarch in 1990 after a bloody pro-democracy
campaign, appoint a government of national unity to oversee the elections.
