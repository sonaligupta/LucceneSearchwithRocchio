FT  20 APR 91 / Finance & The Family: Investors need a PEP talk


   By JOHN AUTHERS


A Gallup survey conducted for Gartmore, the fund management group, last week
showed that ignorance about personal finance is widespread, despite recent
proliferation of products.
It found strong support for more education on personal finance, preferably
in schools or higher education colleges. More than half of the 507 people
polled admitted to having a poor understanding of bonds, investment and unit
trusts, and Personal Equity Plans, although Tessas appear to have caught on
quickly with the public. Only 34 per cent of respondents had a poor
understanding of Tessas, and only 11 per cent were not aware of the scheme,
which is only four months old.
