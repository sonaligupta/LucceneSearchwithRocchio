FT  13 NOV 92 / Output of cars increases by 22%


   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent


UK CAR production last month was 22.2 per cent higher than a year before,
according to figures released yesterday - in spite of short-time working at
Ford's UK car plants and at Rover's car-assembly plant at Longbridge,
Birmingham.
Output increased to 117,674 from 97,130, helped by rising output by Nissan,
the Japanese carmaker, and Vauxhall, the UK subsidiary of General Motors of
the US.
Nissan production last month was 64 per cent higher than a year ago while
Vauxhall's output rose by 15 per cent.
According to the figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders
and the Central Statistical Office, UK car production in the first 10 months
of the year at 1,079,807 was 3.7 per cent higher than in the same period
last year.
Output has performed relatively well during the recession with much higher
production for export markets largely making up for lower output for the
home market.
Nissan began production of its new-generation Micra small car in August and
is due to reach a full production rate of 130,000 cars a year this month.
Vauxhall, which has maintained full-time working during the recession -
helped by rising exports and an improved UK market share - expects to boost
output by 14 per cent this year to a record 300,000.
Output at its Ellesmere Port plant last month was 66 per cent higher than a
year before, when it was depressed by the start of production of the new
Vauxhall/Opel Astra.
New commercial vehicle production last month at 19,486 was 2.9 per cent
lower than a year before, while output for the first 10 months of the year
rose by 24.1 per cent to 214,220.
