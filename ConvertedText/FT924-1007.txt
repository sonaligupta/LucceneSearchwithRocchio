FT  21 DEC 92 / Brazil to push for growth


   By CHRISTINA LAMB


   RIO DE JANEIRO


THE Brazilian government has decided to give a return to growth priority
over combating inflation, in a clear policy shift announced after a two-day
ministerial meeting, writes Christina Lamb in Rio de Janeiro.
The meeting, called to settle on an economic policy and end instability,
ruled out the idea of an economic shock plan rumoured since last week's
suspension of the privatisation programme and resignation of the economy
minister.
The ministers agreed a Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn) government works programme
to stimulate production and employment, and a gradual lowering of interest
rates.
'Under this government the population will not wake up one morning to find
everything has been changed by some arbritary act,' stressed Mr Paulo
Haddad, the planning minister who emerged strengthened from the meeting,
having persuaded President Itamar Franco against a sharp cut in interest
rates. He is also expected to take on the economy portfolio.
