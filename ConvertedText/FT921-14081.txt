FT  17 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Nissan freezes production at Lima car
plant


   By AP-DJ


   TOKYO


NISSAN has suspended work at its car assembly plant in Peru, it said
yesterday, AP-DJ reports from Tokyo.
Japan's second-largest vehicle maker had been producing finished cars in
Lima while Peru's 50 per cent tariff on finished cars made marketing of
imported cars there prohibitively expensive. But, since Peru cut that tariff
to 15 per cent last year, it has become cheaper to import finished cars than
to assemble them locally from imported parts, the company noted.
Nissan said suspension of work, in effect since last October, did not
necessarily mean permanent shut-down.
