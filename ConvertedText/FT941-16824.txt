FT  07 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Management buys PJH for Pounds 25.5m


   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent


PJH Group, one of Britain's largest wholesale distributors of kitchen,
bedroom and bathroom furniture, has been bought by its management from Asko
Deutsche Kaufhaus, one of Germany's leading retail chains, for Pounds 25.5m.
Mr David Riley, a former sales director who has been on the board of Spring
Ram for the last six years, will be the new chief executive. Mr Riley was
headhunted by Spring Ram, the troubled Yorkshire kitchens and bathrooms
group, during its mid-1980s expansion.
Spring Ram is one of PJH's suppliers.
Because of the recession in Germany, Kaufhaus is divesting from non-core
businesses in much the same way as large UK companies did three years ago.
PJH was Kaufhaus's only British interest.
The company, which has annual sales of about Pounds 70m, made a Pounds 3.1m
profit in 1992, and has survived the recession partly because of a
5,000-strong customer base of small or medium-sized builders' merchants and
retailers, rather than supplying a few large outlets.
It operates from Bolton and has eight trading centres throughout Britain,
employing about 400 people.
Founded as Peter J Hopkinson in 1972, PJH was owned by Lonrho from 1978,
which sold it to GBS, a Kaufhaus subsidiary, in 1990.
'The management has already proved itself', Mr Riley said yesterday. 'The
predicted upturn in the home improvement and property markets should offer
scope to grow the business further from its strong base.'
Risk capital was arranged by Montagu Private Equity, supported by Schroder
Ventures, with loans and overdraft facilities from Midland Bank.
