FT  14 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pipe work to boost gas sales to
Italy


   By ROBERT CORZINE


A Dollars 1.6bn loan agreement to refurbish the Russian gas pipeline system
was signed by 47 western banks in London yesterday in a deal which will
allow Gazprom, the gas monopoly, to boost exports to Italy, one of its main
customers.
The credit, which will be drawn down over the next five years, will finance
refurbishment by an Italian consortium consisting of Nuovo Pignone and
Snamprogetti.
The main aim is to reduce the large losses of natural gas as it moves from
Siberia through the Russian pipeline system. The refurbishment will result
in Italy gaining an additional 5.5bn cubic metres of Russian gas - taking
the total above 19m - without any new, expensive wells being drilled.
Mr Earl Teitler of West Merchant Bank, one of the arrangers of the loan,
said it could serve as a model for future energy export contracts with
Russia and other former Soviet republics. Funds from the sale of the gas to
Snam, the national Italian gas company, will be deposited in a US dollar
escrow account, from which the loan will be repayed. The present value of
the gas sales is Dollars 500m a year, rising to Dollars 900m when the
additional amounts become available.
The arrangement was made possible by a World Bank waiver allowing Russian
government revenues to be pledged to a specific project.
Syndication commitments of Dollars 2.2bn exceeded the Dollars 1.6bn
required. Bankers said the positive reaction reflected Gazprom's record of
exporting gas to western Europe without interruption for 25 years.
