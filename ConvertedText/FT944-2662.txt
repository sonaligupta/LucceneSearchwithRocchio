FT  16 DEC 94 / BMA warning on health service


Senior civil servants are following a secret political agenda to destroy the
National Health Service which faces its greatest ever crisis, Dr Sandy
Macara, chairman of the British Medical Association, said yesterday.
Dr Macara said a 'politically inspired mission' was behind moves to
introduce local pay for health workers. He made the claims as he outlined
plans for disruptive action by 80,000 doctors against local pay.
