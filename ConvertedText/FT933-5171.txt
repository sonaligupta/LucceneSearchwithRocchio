FT  04 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: First Direct's interest rate move -
At a Glance


First Direct, the telephone banking arm of Midland bank, has introduced a
staggered interest rate charge for authorised overdrafts. Until August 31,
the authorised rate was 16.2 per cent (17.4 EAR); the change means that
those overdrawn pay 15 per cent per annum (16 EAR) up to Pounds 250 and 18
per cent (19.5 EAR) on borrowings above this amount. The unauthorised
overdraft rate remains 28 per cent per annum (31.8 EAR).
