FT  27 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Hogg Group profits warning


   By RICHARD LAPPER


Shares in Hogg Group, the insurance broker, tumbled 22p to 130p yesterday
after the company warned of a decline in profits for 1993.
The company estimated that pre-tax profits in the year will fall by more
than 50 per cent to Pounds 6m, against Pounds 13.4m in 1992, with an
unexpectedly poor performance by its US business mainly responsible.
Mr Anthony Howland-Jackson, chairman and chief executive, said the final
dividend would be cut to 2.5p, reducing the total for the year from 8.15p to
5.65p.
Hogg has withdrawn from managing Lloyd's agencies and its Downs & Burke fine
arts and jewellery arm, and expects profits from continuing business to fall
from Pounds 10.1m to Pounds 7.3m.
Hogg Robinson, the US broking and benefits division, saw its profits decline
by Pounds 2m. 'New business was not sufficient to offset the effect of rate
reductions in the renewable portfolio, reduced contingency commissions and
lost business. The group's medical third party administration division lost
money, reflecting the depressed state of the medical insurance market. The
group has formed a new alliance with Emperion, a provider of administrative
services in the area, in a bid to improve efficiency.
Hogg's insurance marketing services division in the UK is also expected to
see a fall in profits - by about Pounds 800,000, reflecting the impact of
internal reorganisation. Profits from reinsurance and group investment are
also expected to fall, by Pounds 400,000 and Pounds 1.7m respectively.
Losses at Downs & Burke amounted to Pounds 1.3m. According to Mr
Howland-Jackson, the market in which the broker operated collapsed. Hogg's
Lloyd's agencies, which contributed Pounds 1.6m to profits in 1992, were
divested in 1992.
