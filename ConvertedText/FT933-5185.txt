FT  04 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Bond market finally pays off
for Dow

Wall Street
US equities resisted pressure from unexpectedly weak employment figures and
turned broadly higher yesterday, driven by new record-low yields in the bond
market, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 7.83 at 3,633.93,
though it remained down 7.30 on the week. The more broadly based Standard &
Poor's 500 was just 0.02 higher at 461.33, while the Amex composite was up
0.29 at 461.57, and the Nasdaq composite was 1.06 higher at 749.71. Trading
volume on the NYSE was extremely light, as investors drifted out of the
market ahead of the Labor Day long weekend.
Bond prices soared on the back of weak economic data early in the day. The
Treasury's benchmark 30-year long bond jumped 1 3/8 to 104 9/32 for a record
low yield of 5.94 per cent, following the publication of non-farm payroll
data for August showing that employment had dropped by 39,000.
Tumbling bond yields helped lift equities, which turned broadly higher after
posting mild morning losses.
Advanced Micro Devices fell Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 29 1/8 after the
company said that its engineers had been influenced by Intel's 386 microcode
while developing Advanced Micro's Am486SX microcode. Intel and AMD have been
involved in litigation concerning AMD's right to clone Intel chips for some
years. A California Supreme Court on Thursday agreed to review a ruling
granting cloning rights to AMD. Shares in Intel slipped Dollars  1/4 to
Dollars 62 3/4 .
Another stock to fall heavily was Tootsie Roll, which dropped Dollars 3 3/8
to Dollars 65, a 12-month low. The company said that it knew of no reason
for the shares to fall so precipitately. Volume was 24,200 shares, four
times higher than the average in the thinly-traded stock.
Drug and healthcare stocks were among the most actively traded for the
second day in succession. The sector gave up some of its gains made on
Thursday, which had followed reports that President Bill Clinton had decided
against mandatory price controls on drugs as part of his health care reform
package.
Shares in Merck, which had advanced Dollars 1 5/8 on Thursday, eased Dollars
 1/8 to Dollars 33. Other actives included Glaxo Holdings ADRs, down Dollars
 1/4 to Dollars 18 5/8 , and Schering-Plough, Dollars  3/4 lower at Dollars
62 1/4 . Bristol-Myers Squibb bucked the trend, adding to its gains on
Thursday by rising Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 57 3/8 before settling back to
Dollars 57 1/8 . United Healthcare fell Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 61 1/2 .
Canada
TORONTO share prices ended slightly lower in relatively light trading, ahead
of the Labor Day holiday weekend.
According to preliminary data, the TSE-300 index fell 11.50 points to
4,125.59, for a loss on the week of about eight points. Advances led
declines 371 to 336, volume fell to 49.820m shares from 60.281m shares on
Thursday, and trading value dropped to CDollars 488.3m from CDollars 709.7m.
Nine of the 14 sub-groups ended lower, with golds off 1.88 per cent on index
despite a small rebound in the gold price. Mining, industrial products,
financial services and consumer products were little changed, while energy
issues were moderately higher.
