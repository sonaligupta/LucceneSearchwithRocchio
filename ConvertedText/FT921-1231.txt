FT  25 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: SFC seeks listing of Chinese
'B' shares on HK stock market

   HONG KONG


MR ROBERT NOTTLE, the future chairman of Hong Kong's Securities and Futures
Commission (SFC), said the regulatory watchdog wanted to see Chinese 'B'
shares listed on the Hong Kong stock market, but only when several big
issues had been resolved. These include levels of disclosure and investor
protection in China.
Mr Nottle was speaking after the Hong Kong government officially announced
the departure from the SFC of the current chairman, Mr Robert Owen,
following the completion of his three years of office. Mr Nottle will take
over on May 1.
Mr Nottle said the main areas he intended to pursue were market development,
including the gradual integration of the Hong Kong and Mainland Chinese
capital markets, and investor protection.
He said discussions were already taking place with Hong Kong's Monetary
Affairs Branch over the possibility of broadening the commission's powers of
investigation to help stamp out abuse of minority shareholders.
Mr Owen has in the past called for the government to set up its own
investigative team to utilise existing statutory powers, or to expand the
remit of the commission to cover investigations into fraud and abuse of
minorities.
It is clear, that this is a theme that Mr Nottle intends to continue.
