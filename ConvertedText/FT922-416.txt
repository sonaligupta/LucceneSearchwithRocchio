FT  27 JUN 92 / Rail workers end shutdown


   By NIKKI TAIT


   NEW YORK


Railway employees in the US were returning to work yesterday, after Congress
passed legislation late on Thursday which effectively ended the shutdown of
the nation's freight system, writes Nikki Tait in New York. The bill
provided for an immediate cooling-off period in the dispute, followed by
binding arbitration if no settlement is reached in negotiations between rail
unions and management.
