FT  23 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Thai white sugar sales forecast
to fall 66%


   By DAVID BLACKWELL


THAILAND'S WHITE sugar exports are likely to fall by 66 per cent this year
following a combination of sharply lower overall production and a restricted
premium for white over raw sugar, according to the latest market report from
Czarnikow, the London trade house.
Total production is now forecast to reach only 3.84m tonnes, compared with
initial expectations of 5.5m tonnes. By April 15 only two of the country's
46 mills were still crushing cane.
Last year Thailand exported 1.3m tonnes of white sugar, but the figure could
fall to only 410,000 tonnes this year, the report suggests. Despite a recent
recovery in the white sugar premium to about Dollars 55 a tonne from Dollars
35 a tonne, 'in view of the reduction in the overall supply, it is not
likely that Thai millers will be in a position to revise and enlarge their
remelting programmes for white sugar'.
Remelting is necessary to produce white sugar from raw cane sugar.
In spite of the recent retreat in world sugar prices from three-year highs,
Czarnikow suggests that the market outlook has moved from the prospect of an
increase in stocks to one of a drawdown of around 2m tonnes.
'Although there are ample stocks carried forward from past seasons, it is
clear that periods of temporary supply shortages may occur from time to time
this year. It will therefore fall to the world price to provide the
necessary stimulus to attract supplies out of domestic carry forward stock
and into world trade.'
