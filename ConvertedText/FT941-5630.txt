FT  05 MAR 94 / 'Unique' enterprise scheme launched


   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent


The first enterprise zone trust for industrial property development is
expected to bring enhanced financial benefits to the Scottish economy,
according to Scottish Enterprise, the economic development body.
It says the scheme - in the Lanarkshire enterprise zone - is unique in the
UK.
Akeler Developments of Leeds, which is to raise Pounds 20m from private
investors through an enterprise zone trust, will pass most of the financial
surplus it makes on an 250,000 sq ft industrial development at Blantyre to
Scottish Enterprise. That will be used on economic regeneration in
Lanarkshire and elsewhere.
In return Scottish Enterprise and Akeler will form a partnership which could
lead to Akeler's involvement in other industrial developments.
