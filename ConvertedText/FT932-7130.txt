FT  25 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading


   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE


OPTIONS trading in British Steel was the highlight of a dull day in the
derivatives market yesterday, writes Christopher Price.
Over 7,000 contracts were dealt in the steel maker, equivalent to 7m shares
in the equity market. Dealers said the institutions involved were hedging on
Steel's recovery potential, a fact highlighted by a number of brokers in
recent weeks. The trades included 1,000 of the July calls at 8.5p and 2,000
of the October 110 calls at 7 1/2 p.
Among other stock options, other former nationalised industries also held
sway, with 1,425 British Gas contracts being dealt, followed by 1,255 in
British Airways. These were trailed by Lucas Industries, which traded 1,038,
while Land Securities recorded 678.
However, the day's overall total of 23,887 was well down on Friday. The
FT-SE contract reached 5,686 contracts.
In the futures market, the June contract opened weakly at 2,810, drifting
down fairly smartly to the day's low of 2,802. Buyers were then seen and the
contract perked up, although trading continued in a tight band and low
volume.
Dealers said there was little for the market to focus on, although the
afternoon session was a little livelier on the back of French rate cuts and
a slightly stronger Wall Street.
June closed at 2,834, about 4 points over its fair value level of around
5.5. Volume was a lowly 5,059 contracts.
