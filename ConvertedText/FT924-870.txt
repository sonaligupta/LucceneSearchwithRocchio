FT  22 DEC 92 / International Company News: Cariplo locked in talks over IMI
terms

THE BOARD of Cariplo, the country's biggest savings bank, was locked in
talks on whether to buy into the Istituto Mobiliare Italiano, the financial
services group.
The board meeting followed a late-night cabinet session on Sunday at which
Mr Piero Barucci, the treasury minister, set out the government's final
terms for the sale of its 50 per cent stake in IMI.
The government has set a L3,800bn (Dollars 2.7bn) price on its holding,
based on the lower end of a valuation made by SG Warburg, the UK merchant
bank. A 42 per cent stake has been offered to Cariplo and Iccri, the
organisation linking Italy's savings banks, with the remaining 8 per cent to
be floated.
Rejection of the terms by Cariplo and Iccri would be a severe embarrassment
for the government. The IMI sale was a first step in a wide-ranging
privatisation plan, and the expected receipts form a major part of L7,000bn
expected from privatisation this year.
Bankers widely expected the proposal, which is the latest twist in tortuous
negotiations lasting two years, to be rejected by Cariplo and by Iccri,
whose managing board meets today.
Cariplo and the savings banks have expressed reservations about the price,
although somewhat lower than expected, and the payment terms.
