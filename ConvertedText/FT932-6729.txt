FT  27 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tax boost for MPs on EC business


MPs travelling to European Community institutions on parliamentary business
will no longer have to pay income tax on the money they receive to meet the
cost of such visits.
Mr Michael Portillo, the Treasury chief secretary, said yesterday that he
had tabled a new clause to the finance bill making the concession, which
means that parliamentary travel within the EC is treated on the same basis
as UK Commons-related trips.
Money for expenses is paid under a scheme set up in 1991 to promote greater
interaction between national and EC political institutions. Its introduction
was one of the less prominent aspects of the Maastricht summit.
The Treasury said that it did not expect much revenue to be lost through the
move.
