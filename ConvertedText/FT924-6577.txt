FT  20 NOV 92 / International Company News: Mercedes-Benz considers assembly
in US


   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent


MERCEDES-BENZ, the automotive subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, is considering
setting up a passenger vehicle assembly plant in the US, Mr Gerhard Liener,
Daimler-Benz finance director said yesterday.
Such a plant would probably be built as part of its Freightliner heavy truck
operation in the US, he said.
It is believed Mercedes-Benz is examining the long-term potential for
assembling people carriers in the US.
These high-roof estate cars that carry seven to eight people have been
pioneered by the Renault Espace in Europe and the Chrysler Voyager in the
US.
'We might build a plant for another type of vehicle, not for classic
passenger cars,' said Mr Liener.
'There are many new vehicle configurations in the US - electric cars,
four-wheel drive leisure utility vehicles and minivans.
BMW, the German rival of Mercedes-Benz, announced plans earlier this year to
build a car assembly plant in the US in Spartanburg, South Carolina, its
first large facility outside Germany.
Mercedes-Benz will begin small volume car assembly in Mexico in the first
quarter of next year with the long-term target of supplying some cars from
Mexico to North America, said Mr Liener.
Mercedes-Benz was aiming to increase local content in Mexico to a sufficient
level by the second half of the 1990s to allow it to export cars duty free
from Mexico to the US and Canada under the terms of this year's North
America Free Trade Agreement, he said.
