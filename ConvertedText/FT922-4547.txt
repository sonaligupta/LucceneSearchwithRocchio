FT  05 JUN 92 / Foreign press sparks fury over Tiananmen Square


   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor


THE CHINESE government, in marked contrast to its stated policy of opening
to the outside world, has stepped up interference in the work of foreign
journalists in Beijing.
Mr James Miles, Beijing correspondent of the British Broadcasting
Corporation, has been banned from reporting while his journalist's pass is
being held by the authorities. Mr Miles was detained for five hours on April
30 after covering a protest by European MPs in Tiananmen Square.
The Japanese and German governments lodged protests with the Chinese foreign
ministry over the beating and detention of reporters on Wednesday. France
has said the treatment was unacceptable.
Reporters from TBS television of Japan, DPA news agency of Germany, and ABC
News of the US were detained for three hours as they attempted to report
from the square on the eve of the third anniversary yesterday of the bloody
crackdown on pro-democracy campaigners, in which hundreds were killed.
An ABC correspondent, Mr Todd Carrel, and a Japanese cameraman, Mr Atsushi
Yamagiwa, were beaten up.
The Chinese foreign ministry justified use of force because reporters had
broken the law.
