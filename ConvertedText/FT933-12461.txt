FT  23 JUL 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report


   By REUTER


GOLD was fixed in the afternoon only 15 cents a troy ounce higher than its
morning setting on the London bullion market, reflecting a minor rally after
speculative selling on the Comex opening. It was fixed at Dollars 389.15 a
troy ounce after the market had tested the key Dollars 388 support level,
before buying on the dips lifted prices back above Dollars 390. After its
sell-off the previous night, New York opened with speculator selling and
prices quickly fell, putting the second key support at Dollars 385
apparently under threat. Dealers cited higher than expected US jobless
claims adding to the speculators' already nervous disposition. New York
COFFEE prices were higher at midsession. Analysts said that a lack of follow
through to an early breach of 71 cents was seen as positive and sparked
mixed covering of short positions assumed on the recent slip from
eight-month highs. ALUMINIUM prices showed some downside resilience on the
LME, against a growing perception that the long down-trend is over. Dealers
said the imminent expiry of the labour contract at Alcan's Kitimat smelter
might not lead to an immediate strike.
