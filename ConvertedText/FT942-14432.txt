FT  20 APR 94 / International Company News: GAN static at FFr414m and
restructures bank unit

Groupe GAN, the French insurance group, yesterday confirmed that it
experienced another difficult year in 1993 with static net profits of
FFr414.3m (Dollars 70.2m). It has restructured a banking subsidiary by
removing FFr18.4bn of non-performing property loans from the balance sheet.
GAN's shake-up of its property interests, which includes transfering
FFr12.6bn of loans from its Union Industrielle de Credit (UIC) subsidiary to
a shell company and FFr5.8bn to another subsidiary, follows similar moves by
other French financial groups.
Credit Lyonnais, the ailing state-controlled bank, last month disclosed a
FFr44.9bn rescue package that involves the transfer of FFr40bn of
non-performing property loans. A number of insurance groups, including Union
des Assurances de Paris, have been forced to bale out their troubled banking
interests by moving property loans to less vulnerable subsidiaries.
Mr Francois Heilbronner, chairman of GAN, which is France's third largest
state-controlled insurer, said it was on course for 'very strong' growth
following the restructuring. He added that the group should be ready for
sale later this year.
GAN has been regarded as the weakest of the large French insurers, because
of its relative tardiness in adapting to the recession and its heavy
exposure to the precarious property sector.
These difficulties resulted in a steep decline in net profits to FFr402m in
1992 from FFr2.32bn in 1991. However, conditions in the insurance market
improved last year.
GAN last year saw consolidated sales increase by 17 per cent to FFr154.5bn
from FFr131.9bn in 1992 and the board has frozen the dividend at FFr4.00.
Net profits from French insurance rose by 28 per cent to FFr360m from
FFr282m over the same period. The group returned to the black in foreign
insurance with a contribution of FFr65m against a FFr52m loss in the
previous year.
However, GAN's banking interests were more problematic. UIC last year fell
into the red with a net deficit of FFr856m from net profits of FFr152m in
1992. Its difficulties forced GAN to make a provision of FFr3.3bn to cover
restructuring costs, although the group was able to counter this with a
FFr3.3bn net credit from a change in accountancy methods for its life
insurance business.
