FT  27 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Hanson makes three US disposals for Pounds
40m


   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY


Hanson Industries, the US arm of Hanson, announced the completion of three
asset sales for Pounds 40m, which will realise a pre-tax gain of about
Pounds 8m.
'These latest disposals are part of the general process of tidying up
Hanson's portfolio,' said Mr Christopher Collins, director of corporate
development.
The disposals fit in with Hanson's strategy of reducing debt through
disposals and flotations while expanding its core businesses. In the
financial year that ends on Friday Hanson has sold assets worth more than
Pounds 950m on both sides of the Atlantic.
These included the flotation of its Beazer housebuilding operations, the
sale of 11 UK companies to management buy-out teams backed by Electra, the
venture capital group, and the sales of Axelson oil industry equipment group
and Hanson Office Products contract stationery business.
The latest disposals in the US include International Mini Warehouse
Associates, which was part of the Kidde acquisition in 1987 and owns nine
warehouses in New Jersey and Connecticut.
Proctor & Schwartz, part of the SCM Corporation acquired by Hanson in 1986,
which designs and manufactures industrial drying and heat setting machines
for the food, tobacco, textile and chemical industries, has also been sold.
Hanson also announced the sale of 100,000 acres of land, including surface
and mineral rights, which it acquired with the purchase of Beazer in 1991.
The assets sold generated operating profits of Pounds 2.3m in the year to
September 30 1993 on turnover of Pounds 38m.
