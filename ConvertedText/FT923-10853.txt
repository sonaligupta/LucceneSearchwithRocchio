FT  28 JUL 92 / Retailers to press for changes


   By JOHN THORNHILL


MANY leading retailers are to press for changes to commercial rental
arrangements, arguing that current practices distort the free-market economy
to the detriment of consumers, John Thornhill writes.
Sir Desmond Pitcher, chief executive of Littlewoods, has written to most of
the UK's biggest retailers suggesting that they take action. A meeting will
take place this autumn to co-ordinate their approach.
Sir Desmond said he wanted to update the 25-year commercial property leases,
unique to Britain, which provide for upward-only rent reviews every five
years. 'In the real world prices go down as well as up,' he said. 'We think
that arbitration should take into account the economic factors now
prevailing.'
A recent report by the free-market Adam Smith Institute argued that 'the
rent review process constitutes an institutionalised, legally induced form
of cost inflation that is very impervious to market forces'.
