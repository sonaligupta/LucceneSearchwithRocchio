FT  04 SEP 93 / International Company News: Japanese stores dip sharply

JAPAN'S prolonged slump in consumer spending has hit Marui and Tokyu
Department Stores, two leading department stores, which reported sharp falls
in mid-term sales and profits yesterday.
Marui, a retailer popular among younger customers, posted a 29.9 per cent
fall in non-consolidated pre-tax profits for the six months to July to
Y15.4bn (Dollars 145.28m) on a 7.2 per cent fall in sales to Y249.1bn.
After-tax profits declined 29.5 per cent to Y8.4bn.
Tokyu Department Store saw non-consolidated half-year pre-tax profits plunge
44.9 per cent to Y2.1bn on a 10.9 per cent fall in sales to Y170.8bn and a
38.5 per cent fall in after-tax profits to Y1bn.
Department stores have been hit hard by the current economic slump as
Japanese consumers have tightened their belts and have turned to discount
retailers and cheaper specialty stores.
The bad summer weather has also affected sales of clothing and electric
appliances, adding to the profit decline.
Last week, Mitsukoshi warned it would post a pre-tax loss for the current
business year.
For the full year to next January, Marui projects a 14.2 per cent fall in
pre-tax profits to Y30bn on a 3.5 per cent decline in sales to Y520bn.
Tokyu Department Store expects a 40.2 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to
Y4bn on a 8.1 per cent decline in sales to Y348bn.
