FT  22 JUL 94 / Observer: Shuffle off


At last, good news for the UK's Tory government. The annual report from the
Invest in Britain Bureau - part of the department of trade and industry -
yesterday showed a record number of new jobs created by inward investment
last year.
How satisfying for Tim Sainsbury who, as junior minister at the DTI wrote
the report's foreword. Only one hiccup. Sainsbury was a victim of John
Major's government reshuffle - and thus absent from the presentation.
