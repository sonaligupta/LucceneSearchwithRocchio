FT  05 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Fed grants Hongkong Bank application


   By JUREK MARTIN


   WASHINGTON


THE US Federal Reserve has rejected an attempt by Lloyds Bank to use the US
banking laws to block Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's bid for
Midland Bank.
The central bank has granted HSBC's request for temporary authority under
the 1956 US Bank Holding Company Act, to acquire Midland, and thereby engage
indirectly in non-bank activities in the US. Lloyds had made submissions
opposing the request.
In its judgment, the Fed said that 'the information presented by Lloyds does
not compel denial of the application'. While reserving the right to review
the situation, it added that Lloyds could file an application in pursuit of
its counter-bid for Midland on the same basis as HSBC, the presumption being
that it would also be granted.
'The board has determined,' the Fed said, 'that HSBC would not derive any
material competitive advantage over US bank holding companies as a result of
this acquisition.' Nor had HSBC engaged in any 'impermissible conduct' in
the US.
It said that the transaction would occur 'substantially outside the US and
is proposed predominantly for reasons unrelated to the US'. Midland, it
said, had only 3 per cent of its global assets in the US.
Noting that UK authorities had not objected to the HSBC bid, 'the board
believes that it is in the public interest to limit the effects of US
regulation on an essentially foreign transaction, provided, as in this case,
that the exemption does not grant substantial competitive advantage to the
foreign organisation or have other adverse effects in the US'.
