FT  16 NOV 93 / Moslems to sue Britain over arms


   By MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS and RACHEL JOHNSON


   NEW YORK,, LONDON


BOSNIA'S Moslem-led government will sue Britain before the World Court for
'failing to prevent genocide' through its Balkans policy, Bosnia's UN
delegate announced last night. Mr Mohamed Sacirbey cited the convention
against genocide and asserted that UK opposition to lifting the arms embargo
against Bosnia was responsible for a massive loss of life.
He accused Mr John Major, UK prime minister, of opposing lifting the arms
ban for domestic political reasons. He said other countries were not
blameless but Britain was accused because it was 'at the forefront' in
maintaining the embargo.
The UK foreign office last night indicated that the delegate's legal
challenge brought the Bosnia debate back on to familiar territory.
'Ministers have defended many times our policy of not lifing the arms
embargo. The policy issue is clear, and the right approach is not to lift
the embargo.'
