FT  06 NOV 93 / How to Spend It: Barclay & Bodie


Barclay & Bodie, 7 - 9 Blenheim Terrace, London NW8 OEH. Tel: 071-372-5705.
Pounds 2.00 for the catalogue.
Most people who live in St. John's Wood in London know of Barclay & Bodie -
a charming small shop which always seems to gather together a collection of
useful and decorative things that nobody else has found. For Christmas there
is a small mail order catalogue with just a selection of some of the things
on offer. Photographed left is some exceptionally pretty yellow and green
French Provencal oven-to-tableware - the dishes each come with appropriate
woven baskets. Prices range from Pounds 36 for a medium-sized jug to Pounds
85 for the largest dish. There's a soft lambswool rug (Pounds 52), a gadget
for measuring the net which is a good stocking filler for a tennis player
(Pounds 15.50) and a magnifying glass-cum-letter opener (Pounds 19.95).
