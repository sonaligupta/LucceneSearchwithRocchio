FT  13 APR 94 / UK Company News: C&W to cut staff in Pounds 20m cost saving
plan


   By DAVID WIGHTON


Cable and Wireless, the international telecommunications group, is hoping to
save Pounds 20m a year by cutting the size of its London headquarters.
The headcount in corporate departments will be reduced from 130 to 80 and
there will be unspecified cuts among the 300 London-based staff who manage
the group's overseas operations.
The move reflects the decision by Mr James Ross, chief executive, to change
the group from a traditional centralised structure to an 'international
alliance' of companies.
In a letter to London-based employees Mr Ross said: 'The regional businesses
and offices will be refocused to move the group closer to the customer, to
deploy their skills across company and national boundaries and to develop
new business opportunities.'
The work of central service departments will be moved into the businesses or
outsourced.
The cuts in the London-based regional staff have not yet been finalised but
employees will be informed by the end of the month.
A large part of the projected savings will be generated by reducing the
number of London offices the group occupies, though it will be retaining its
refurbished headquarters in Theobald's Road.
The company declined to say which central services would be affected but
cuts are likely to involve departments such as personnel, pensions, and
accounting.
It is thought that posts will be cut up to, but not including, C&W's top
dozen managers.
The letter to employees says that a 'substantial' number of those staff
affected will be offered other posts within the group but stresses that
plans are at too early a stage to allow estimates of redundancies to be
made.
C&W has 12,000 staff in the UK, out of a worldwide workforce of 40,000, of
which 10,000 are employed by Mercury Communications.
