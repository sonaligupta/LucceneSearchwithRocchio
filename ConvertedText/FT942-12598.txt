FT  28 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Bids alert


   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRIS PRICE and PETER JOHN.


The return of bid activity in the London market saw a number of old
speculative targets taken out of the cupboard and dusted down. The main
vulnerable companies were seen to be Vickers, Fisons and United Biscuits,
but each were also supported for other reasons.
UB was being linked with American Brands, flushed with cash from this week's
Dollars 1bn deal with BAT, although food manufacturing analysts said a
link-up with US food giant Nabisco would make more strategic sense for the
UK company. However, they also pointed out that UB was benefiting from good
results from the snack division of PepsiCo, the US food and drink group. UB
shares advanced 11 to 359p.
Fisons a perennial takeover subject, rose 6 to 155p, the shares receiving
help from a strategic overview published by Smith New Court. The house has
added the company to its list of core stocks. The house also added Reckitt &
Colman to the list. The thinly traded stock jumped 16 to 664p.
Vickers gained 5 to 199p ahead of its annual meeting today. Robert Fleming
Securities argue however that the main support lies in the recovery of the
company's Roll's Royce car division.
