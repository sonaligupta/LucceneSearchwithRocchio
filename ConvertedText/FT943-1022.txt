Former President Mr Leonid Kravchuk has won election to parliament, just
three months after being narrowly defeated in his bid for a second term as
Ukraine's leader, election officials said. Mr Kravchuk, a former Communist
party chief, received 87 per cent of the votes cast in Sunday's by-election
in a two-candidate race. His challenger for a seat in the 450-seat
parliament, Mr Nikolai Novosilsky, got only 10 per cent of the votes, said
Mr Valentin Kirnenko, deputy chairman of the Central Electoral Commission.
Mr Kravchuk, 60, was Ukraine's first president after the former Soviet
republic gained independence in 1991, and was defeated in the presidential
election by former prime minister Leonid Kuchma. He says he intends to
establish his own political party and rebuild his power base.
