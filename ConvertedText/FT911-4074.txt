FT  22 APR 91 / Norway party picks woman

NORWAY'S main opposition Conservative party elected a 40-year-old woman
leader at the weekend, in a further advance for the country's already high
female participation in politics, Robert Taylor reports from Stockholm.
Mrs Kaci Kullmann Five is the third woman now heading a Norwegian party,
with Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, Labour prime minister, and the recently
elected Centre party leader, Ms Anne Enger Lahnstein. Norway has a larger
proportion of women in political life than any other democracy. Nine of the
19 cabinet members are women, as are 59 of the 165 MPs.
Mrs Five (called Kaci by almost everyone), a mother of two, is a popular
choice for the Conservatives. Intelligent and friendly, she promises to
bring a breath of fresh air to a party that has become demoralised over the
past five years under three elderly male leaders.
Expectation of her election has made an impact on the Conservative position
in opinion polls. Two months ago, the party hit an all-time low of 14.4 per
cent, but a survey by Opinion A/S at the weekend showed the party at 22.5
per cent - second behind Labour.
Mrs Five was trade minister in the right-centre coalition government that
fell last October. Always a champion of Norway joining the European
Community, she gave the issue top priority in her inaugural speech to party
workers. She wants Norway to apply for membership in step with Sweden, which
is expected to apply in June.
An opinion survey yesterday in Aftonposten, Norway's leading newspaper,
indicated 47 per cent favouring the country joining the EC (more than in
earlier polls) and 45 per cent against.
