FT  22 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tobacco producers get together
to oppose US import curb


   By LISA BRANSTEN


   WASHINGTON


AMBASSADORS FROM 13 tobacco-exporting countries are fighting a provision
slipped into the US Budget Bill that would require US cigarette
manufacturers to use a minimum of 75 per cent of domestically-grown tobacco
in their products.
Under the provision, inserted by Senator Wendell Ford, a Kentucky Democrat,
cigarette producers would face substantial penalties for using more than 25
per cent imported tobacco.
'For years, US representatives in the Gatt Uruguay Round negotiations and
elsewhere have been consistently fighting against this kind of provision in
the name of free trade and for the benefit of both consumers and efficient
producers,' the ambassadors said in a letter to Representative Kika De La
Garza, who heads the house committee on agriculture.
Signatories to the letter were the ambassadors from Brazil, Argentina, Costa
Rica, Chile, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras,
Panama, Colombia, Malawi, Zimbabwe and India.
An aide to Senator Ford said the measure was necessary to protect domestic
tobacco growers from the 'growing influx of tobacco coming into the
country'.
