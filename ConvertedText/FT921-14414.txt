FT  16 JAN 92 / International Company News: Treuhand to rule on petrol bids


   By LESLIE COLITT

THE TREUHAND agency's managing board is to choose today between rival bids
for eastern Germany's lucrative Minol petrol stations which are being sold
in combination with the loss-making Leuna refinery.
A British Petroleum-led consortium including Total, the French oil company,
Norway's Statoil, Agip of Italy and the Austrian OMV, is competing against a
consortium led by Thyssen Handelsunion which includes Elf-Aquitaine,
partly-owned by the French government, and Deutsche SB-Kauf.
Minol made a profit of DM250m (Dollars 158m) in 1990 while the obsolescent
Leuna refinery contributed 50 per cent of the DM2.1bn turnover of Leuna
chemical works which had losses of DM360m last year. The Treuhand is selling
them as a package in order to find a buyer for the hard-to-sell refinery
which is closely integrated with the Leuna chemical plant.
A Treuhand official said the Thyssen-led consortium appeared to have an
advantage as it was offering more than DM5bn in investments to build a new
Leuna refinery and pipeline and to modernise the petrol stations. One of the
agency's conditions was that the new owner must supply the chemical plant
with advantageously-priced products.
BP, which entered the east German market soon after the collapse of the
communist regime, had been confident that this had put it in a favourable
position, an official said. However, BP did not obtain the subsidies it had
counted on. Both London and Paris lobbied strongly in Bonn.
Minol's 1,300 petrol stations in eastern Germany have higher sales per pump
than equivalent stations in the west and the company is expected to profit
heavily from the sharp growth in car ownership.
