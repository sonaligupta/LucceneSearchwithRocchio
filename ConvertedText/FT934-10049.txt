FT  08 NOV 93 / Commission heads for clash over council restructuring


   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor


THE Local Government Commission will today publish its final recommendations
for reorganising local authorities in Cleveland, Durham and Derbyshire in a
move that is likely to spark a clash with the environment secretary.
It is expected to recommend maintenance of the two-tier structure in Durham
and much of Derbyshire, rejecting the government's preference for unitary
one-tier authorities.
This move will put the commission on a collision course with Mr John Gummer,
the environment secretary, who has said that two-tier authorities should be
the exception.
Mr David Curry, local government minister, said last month that proposals
from the commission to retain two-tier authorities might be rejected.
However, that could precipitate the resignation of Sir John Banham, the
commission's chairman, who has recently criticised ministerial interference.
He has also suggested that reorganisation should be reconsidered if it would
add substantially to costs.
Sir John has already revealed that proposals for two unitary authorities in
Derbyshire have been withdrawn because of local opposition. In a Mori poll
for the commission, 39 per cent gave the status quo as their first
preference. The next most popular option, two unitary authorities, won
support from only 11 per cent.
The final recommendations for Derbyshire are thought to include two unitary
authorities for the city of Derby and north-east Derbyshire. The rest of the
county would be covered by a two-tier structure.
For Durham, the likely recommendation is to retain the existing two-tier
county and district councils.
In Cleveland the commission is expected to stick to its original proposals
for four unitary authorities.
