FT  07 MAR 94 / Rift denied as mandarin quits


   By ROBERT RICE


One of Whitehall's senior mandarins, Sir Clive Whitmore, permanent
under-secretary at the Home Office, is leaving to take up a job in the
private sector.
Government sources yesterday confirmed Sir Clive's decision to quit, but
denied any rift between him and Mr Michael Howard, home secretary.
Officially, Sir Clive is said to be leaving six months early to take
advantage of a job offer which might not be open to him if he waited until
he was due to retire next January.
But news of his early departure will fuel speculation within Whitehall of
increasingly difficult relations between Mr Howard and his senior officials.
Senior Home Office advisers are said to be sceptical of Mr Howard's hardline
views on criminal justice and unhappy about his apparent unwillingness to
accept their advice.
Press reports of a letter, sent to Sir Clive last November by important Home
Office policymakers who complained that Mr Howard consistently ignored their
advice, drew a public denial of a crisis from Sir Clive.
In a letter to The Guardian, he denied the existence of the officials'
letter and said policy formulation in the Home Office was 'as it always has
been: vigorous and healthy'.
But in spite of these denials, morale in the Home Office is said to be low.
Officials are known to be dismayed that Mr Howard overlooked their advice on
important aspects of the police and magistrates' courts bill forcing the
government into a series of climbdowns in the House of Lords.
However, Whitehall observers said that with less than a year to go before
retirement, Sir Clive's departure would not be as embarrassing to the
government as the resignation last November of Sir Geoffrey Holland,
permanent secretary at the Department for Education. Sir Geoffrey resigned
amid claims of a serious rift between him and Mr John Patten, education
secretary.
