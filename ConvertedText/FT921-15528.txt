FT  09 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: More cracks in British Steel


FT-SE Index: 2,467.1 (-15.8)
British Steel's decision to bring forward the closure of its Ravenscraig
plant is open to two interpretations. One is that it was strategically
desirable to act before an election which could return a Labour government.
The other is that the steel market is even worse than expected. Sadly for
the economy at large as well as the company's shareholders, the latter looks
the main motive.
The downturn in Germany, along with economic ferment in Russia and the rest
of eastern Europe, leaves the European market apparently condemned to
chronic oversupply. Even though the redundancy costs are already provided
for, the company faces an accelerated depreciation charge of some Pounds 35m
which will swell this year's loss. It will certainly have to act on its
earlier dividend warning. There must now also be doubts about when the
previous rather generous dividend can be restored, if at all.
British Steel is thus in limbo. It can no longer be classified as an income
stock, but it is far too early for any recovery appeal. The Ravenscraig
closure will eventually produce cost savings of some Pounds 50m, but the
full year effect will not be felt until 1993-94. The shares have already
underperformed the market by nearly 50 per cent over the past year. They may
have further to fall as the last income funds lose heart.
