FT  15 JUN 93 / International Company News: Apple raises stakes in prices
war


   By LOUISE KEHOE


   SAN FRANCISCO


APPLE Computer yesterday announced US price cuts and customer rebates in a
move that could spark a price war in the personal computer industry. Over
the past 18 months, prices of PCs in the US have declined by nearly 50 per
cent.
Last week Apple's share price fell sharply when the company predicted lower
than expected second-half earnings because of price cutting. Apple was
trading yesterday at Dollars 44 5/8 .
Apple lowered US retail prices on selected computers by between 6.8 per cent
and 12.6 per cent, and by as much as 26 per cent on some peripherals.
The company also announced a promotion with 'On-the-spot rebates', giving
customers cash rebates of Dollars 50 to Dollars 350 on the purchase of a
selection of Macintosh computers and Apple scanners and printers.
For example, a Macintosh IIvx 4/80, middle of the product line desktop
computer was reduced from Dollars 1,899 to Dollars 1,659. Purchasers will
also get a Dollars 150 rebate, until September 30, bringing the effective
price down to Dollars 1,509.
'Momentum for Macintosh products remains strong - unit shipments increased
35 per cent in the first half of our fiscal year,' said Mr Bob Puette,
president of Apple USA. 'And, we're committed to accelerating that
momentum.'
Yesterday's moves mark the second time in two months that Apple has reduced
prices. In May, the company lowered the prices of some of its computers by
up to 16 per cent and cut some printer prices by 29 per cent.
