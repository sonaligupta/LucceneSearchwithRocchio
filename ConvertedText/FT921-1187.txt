FT  25 MAR 92 / Senator Rudman gives up on Washington


   By JUREK MARTIN


   WASHINGTON


SENATOR Warren Rudman (left), a Republican from New Hampshire, said
yesterday he would not seek re-election this year for a third term, writes
Jurek Martin in Washington. Unlike others, he is not leaving the Senate
because he is an incumbent under threat, but because he does not like
Washington.
He repeated that he has found life and work there 'terribly frustrating'.
Though considered an effective senator, usually but not reflexively
conservative, he said Congress had failed to address great issues, such as
rising costs of social security and Medicare.
Mr Rudman is probably best known as co-author of the Gramm-Rudman deficit
reduction act of 1985. New Hampshire is a conservative state and his seat is
unlikely to go Democratic.
