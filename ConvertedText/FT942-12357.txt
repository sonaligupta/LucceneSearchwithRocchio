FT  29 APR 94 / World Stock Markets: Premium for Tele Danmark


   By HILARY BARNES


   COPENHAGEN


Tele Danmark, the Danish telecommunications monopoly, went to a premium when
trading in the shares opened in Copenhagen and New York yesterday.
The domestic market took the shares to DKr332.50, a premium of 7.3 per cent
over the selling price of DKr310 (Dollars 23.53 per American depositary
share) fixed for the privatisation earlier in the day, when subscriptions
closed.
The offer was four times oversubscribed and raised a total of DKr19.5bn
(Dollars 2.96bn). It was made on the book-building system, involving bids
from potential shareholders, and the selling price was at the upper end of
the DKr275-315 range at which bids were made.
The issue, which reduces the state's holding in the company to 51 per cent,
has been watched with considerable interest as it is the first of a series
of privatisations expected to be made by European telephone companies.
The selling price puts a value on Tele Danmark which is closely in line with
telephone companies already listed on European and American stock exchanges.
The flotation was by far the biggest by a Danish company and one of the
largest international issues ever made, according to Goldman Sachs, which
acted, with Den Danske Bank, as international co-ordinator for the offer.
About 18 per cent of the shares were sold domestically and the rest to
non-residents, including 41 per cent of the issue in the USA. The retail
issue raised about Dollars 300m, said Tele Danmark, most of it through sales
to 28,000 Danish investors.
The latter had more reason to feel pleased than investors in a recent
Copenhagen Airport privatisation issue, where the shares traded at a
discount to the offer price. The 10,500 employees of Tele Danmark, who
bought 718,000 shares at a preferential price of DKr100, had even more of an
excuse to celebrate last night.
