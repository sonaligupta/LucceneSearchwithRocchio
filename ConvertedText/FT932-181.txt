FT  30 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour backs McNamara in Ulster
document row


   By RALPH ATKINS


AN EMBARRASSED Labour leadership yesterday repudiated an internal paper that
suggested joint British/Irish rule as an option for Northern Ireland - and
led Mr John Major to call for the party's spokesman on the province to be
sacked.
Labour officials said the report for Mr Kevin Mc-Namara, shadow Northern
Ireland secretary, had been prepared before the general election. It had not
been seen by the shadow cabinet, Mr Neil Kinnock, then party leader, or by
his successor, Mr John Smith.
The paper, which angered Unionist MPs was now 'invalid', Labour said. There
was no question of Mr McNamara being sacked, it added.
Mr McNamara confirmed that the options explored were not Labour policy and
he would not be offering his resignation. He also ruled out Labour backing
an independent Ulster. However some of the leaked proposals were consistent
with Mr McNamara's thinking on Northern Ireland - which has consistently
infuriated Unionist MPs. Labour's 1992 manifesto pledged to work within the
1985 Anglo-Irish agreement 'to achieve our policy of unity by consent'.
The discussion paper sets out a number of ways that objective might be
achieved - including 'shared responsibility' between Britain and the Irish
republic.
Mr McNamara plans to publish this autumn a discussion paper on Northern
Ireland that will build on the leaked paper's proposals. He backs
'round-table' talks between nationalist and unionist politicians but
believes unionists should not necessarily be allowed a veto, and that if
negotiations break down, the two governments should look to set up new
political institutions.
The prime minister said the leaked proposals for joint rule were 'a recipe
for disaster'. The Labour leader had 'an obligation to tell the people of
Northern Ireland whether or not that is the policy of their party,' Mr Major
said.
