FT  22 JUL 94 / Observer: Clothed in secrecy


So what will Central Intelligence Agency director James Woolsey be wearing
today? Fridays at the CIA are now 'dressing-down' days. Not more
recriminations over the Aldrich Ames spy debacle, but an experiment in
casual dressing.
It's the latest effort by Woolsey to alter CIA culture from that of a
closed, white male fraternity, into something a little more, well, casual.
Supporters of this trend, now creeping across US life, claim it enhances
team spirit and productivity. Others suggest that since most people slack on
Fridays anyway, they may as well look the part.
Woolsey says the spooks may wear red suits or stand on their head for all he
cares - just so long as they do a good job.
But even though a renowned demon on the ballroom floor, Woolsey is unlikely
to turn up today in his patent-leather dancing pumps. Too slippery by far .
