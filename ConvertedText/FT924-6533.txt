Send a cheque this morning to your favourite charity then, with a clear
conscience, you can ignore the hype and smugness which makes BBC1's annual
Children In Need appeal such an embarrassing occasion.
C4's Short Stories (8.30) shows short films from new directors. Today we
have a picture of 'The Comper Queen', Rita Smallburn, one of those women who
dedicate their entire lives to entering competitions. Do we really need five
programmes about Howard Carter's discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb 70 years
ago? The people at BBC2 seem to think so. The Face Of Tutankhamun begins at
9.00.
It is followed by the first in a series of 10-minute programmes, Sister
Wendy's Odyssey, in which Wendy Beckett, who has spent 20 years as a
solitary nun in a caravan, gives her views on some of the greatest works of
art in various British cities. She has become a renowned art expert, we are
assured, 'by using books and postcards' (9.50). BBC2 screens Jean-Luc
Godard's 1960 film, his first and best, A Bout de Souffle (11.20) and C4
shows Karel Reisz's 1966 offering Morgan - A Suitable Case For Treatment.
