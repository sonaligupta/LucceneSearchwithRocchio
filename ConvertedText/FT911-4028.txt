7.9%


   By BARBARA DURR


FRUIT of the Loom, the leading US producer and marketer of men's and boys'
underwear, reported first-quarter sales of Dollars 349.2m, a jump of 7.9 per
cent from Dollars 323.7m a year earlier.
Net earnings rose 25 per cent to Dollars 15.9m, or 25 cents per share, from
Dollars 12.8m, or 20 cents per share, last year.
Operating earnings increased 10.8 per cent to Dollars 63.4m from Dollars
57.2m.
Mr William Farley, chairman, said that the 1991 first quarter benefited from
stronger distribution in Europe and the introduction of 15 new product
lines. Nearly completed plant modernisations and debt-to-equity improvements
also helped improve first-quarter results, he said.
Fruit of the Loom, a leading supplier of T-shirts for speciality imprints,
was boosted by the Gulf war. American demand for patriotic T-shirts boomed
during the quarter.
