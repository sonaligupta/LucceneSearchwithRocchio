George Weston Foods, the Australian biscuit and dairy products group, has
held its interim dividend at 9.5 cents a share after a marginal rise in
earnings during the six months to January.
The company, which is controlled by Associated British Foods, lifted
earnings to ADollars 25.8m (USDollars 18.7m) from ADollars 25.7m on a 4.8
per cent rise in revenues, to ADollars 526m from ADollars 502.5m.
Directors indicated results had been held back by costs associated with a
contamination scare during the half in one of the company's pie products.
They said price discounting and soft demand in other food areas, especially
bread, also subdued trading.
Tax provision took ADollars 11.6m, against ADollars 16.1m previously, and
depreciation ADollars 17.5m, compared with ADollars 16.5m. Interest expense
was negligible, at ADollars 181,000 against ADollars 275,000.
