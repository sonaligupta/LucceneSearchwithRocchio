FT  15 APR 94 / International Company News: Rubbermaid growth evaporates


   By RICHARD TOMKINS


Rubbermaid, the US household goods group named 'America's most admired
company' by Forbes magazine at the beginning of the year, yesterday reported
a sharp downturn in first-quarter profits growth.
Net income rose by barely 2 per cent from Dollars 49.6m in the comparable
period to Dollars 50.6m. Turnover was up by 2 per cent to Dollars 491.6m and
earnings per share rose from 31 cents to 32 cents.
The company had earlier established a reputation for turning in big
increases in earnings from year to year. In the 10 years to 1992, earnings
growth averaged 18 per cent a year.
Mr Wolfgang Schmitt, chairman and chief executive, said the first quarter's
figures reflected particularly soft sales in January and February because of
unusually harsh weather conditions across the US. Bad weather also caused
temporary plant closures, so reducing plant efficiency.
In addition, Mr Schmitt said retailers' efforts to cut stocks in the quarter
held back the company's turnover growth even though store sales of
Rubbermaid's products were up.
'March orders, however, have shown substantial improvement, and that
improvement is continuing into April,' Mr Schmitt said. 'As a result, we
look for more favourable second-quarter sales and earnings comparisons.'
