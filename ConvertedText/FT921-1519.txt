FT  24 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Ayrshire Metal falls to Pounds 0.3m loss


Turnover at Ayrshire Metal Products declined from Pounds 36.8m to Pounds
26.9m in 1991, leading to a fall to pre-tax losses of Pounds 297,000,
against profits of Pounds 1.21m.
The company said that volumes in its main markets for cold-formed sections
were depressed and that price competition had reduced margins throughout the
industry. The difficult trading conditions of the first half had continued
into the second.
The share of losses of the associate increased to Pounds 236,000 (Pounds
27,000) and, below the line, losses worked through at 2.3p (earnings 8.5p).
The dividend for the year is passed - shareholders previously received a
7.5p total.
