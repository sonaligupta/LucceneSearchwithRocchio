FT  16 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Row over S Korean rail deal settled

GEC-Alsthom said yesterday it had resolved a dispute among its South Korean
subcontractors that threatened to derail a Dollars 2.4bn (Pounds 1.6bn)
contract to supply the train a grande vitesse (TGV) for the country's new
high-speed rail system.
The row erupted last November when GEC-Alsthom selected Hyundai Precision
and Industry instead of Daewoo Heavy Industries to head a consortium to
build the TGV under licence in South Korea.
Daewoo protested, calling the decision unfair. It said it had been
GEC-Alsthom's main partner when the Anglo-French group bid for the
high-speed train contract against Siemens of Germany and Mitsubishi of
Japan. GEC-Alsthom said Hyundai was selected as the consortium leader on the
basis of its industrial and technical capability.
Daewoo, expressing fears that it would not have access to technology
transfers if it remained a junior partner in the consortium, filed a suit to
block talks between GEC-Alsthom and the government on a final contract.
Following the dismissal of the suit last month by a South Korean court,
Daewoo has now agreed to join the consortium with the guarantee that it will
have full access to technology transfers, GEC-Alsthom said.
