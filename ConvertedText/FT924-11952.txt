FT  23 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Open skies talks are postponed


   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent


THE UK and the US governments yesterday failed to reach an 'open skies'
agreement but said they would resume negotiations soon to try to liberalise
air transport between the two countries.
After three days of intense negotiations in London, the two sides said there
were still several difficult issues to be resolved before an agreement could
be reached.
No date has yet been fixed for a new round of talks, but the UK department
of transport said the negotiations were expected to resume 'soon'.
Both the Bush administration and the UK government appear keen to reach an
agreement which would clear the way for US government approval of British
Airways' proposed acquisition of a 44 per cent stake in USAir for Dollars
750m.
But the three largest US carriers have mounted a fierce campaign against the
BA-USAir deal, pressing the US not to approve the transaction unless it can
secure greater access to the UK for US airlines.
BA is expected to announce today an agreement to rescue Dan-Air, the
financially troubled independent UK carrier.
