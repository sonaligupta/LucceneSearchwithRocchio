FT  11 JAN 92 / Appointments: New finance directors for Asda and D&N


Archie Norman, the 37-year-old chief executive of troubled retailer Asda,
has made a quick move since his arrival in early December with the
appointment of a new finance director.
Ron Scott, who has been in the post since 1988, was closely identified with
recent mishaps including the financing of the purchase of the Gateway
superstores in 1989 which left the company heavily debt-laden as interest
rates soared. Scott, 42, leaves at the end of March, but not before he has
to present what city analysts expect to be dismal interim results for the
six months ending October 1991 next Wednesday.
His replacement, 41-year-old Phil Cox, knows something about troubled
businesses after nearly two years as chief executive of the now much
diminished recruitment and financial services company Burns-Anderson. He
left last October after completing his task of disposing of most of the
financial services operations. Hitherto his experience had been in retailing
 -though not food - most recently as finance director of Horne Brothers
before it was acquired by Sears.
Asda's share price drop of 4p to 28 1/2 p yesterday was attributed to
nervousness ahead of Wednesday's interim.
Meanwhile, Tim Redburn, who helped turn round the troubled Hoverspeed
cross-channel hovercraft operator in the mid-1980s, has been appointed
finance director of Davies & Newman, parent of the UK's Dan-Air which was
rescued from the brink of bankruptcy last year.
Redburn, 38, is the first of a number of external appointments made to
strengthen the Davies & Newman board. Wilf Jones, the previous finance
director, quit at the end of 1990 following the arrival of David James, the
company doctor. In the interim the job has been undertaken by Ronald Series,
one of David James' team.
Later this year James is expected to step down as chairman and hand over the
management to a chief executive yet to be appointed.
Although Davies & Newman is between three and four times as big as
Hoverspeed, Redburn says there are 'lots of similarities between the two
businesses'.
