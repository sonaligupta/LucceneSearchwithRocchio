FT  11 APR 94 / Managers' pay rises 'lowest since 1975'


   By IAN WHEELER


Management pay rises have averaged only 2.8 per cent during the past 12
months, the lowest level recorded by The Reward Group pay analysts since
1975.
In its survey of management salaries, Reward said the average figure for the
past four months was down to 2.3 per cent. The figures, based on 19,864 job
recordings, put managers about 0.1 per cent behind clerical and operative
staff for the past four months, but slightly ahead for the year.
Mr Steve Flather, managing director of Reward, said the survey 'confirmed
the continuing low level of pay increases for management'. He predicted low
inflation and high unemployment meant there was 'unlikely to be a wage
explosion in the short term'.
London is the highest paying region and the west Midlands the lowest.
