FT  26 MAY 93 / International Company News: New orders down 27.6% at
debt-laden Kumagai


   By ROBERT THOMSON


KUMAGAI GUMI, the ambitious Japanese developer and contractor, has suffered
a 39.7 per cent slide to Y9bn (Dollars 81.81m) in pre-tax profits as its
leading banks intensify the restructuring of the company, which has debts of
Y738bn.
Sales for the year fell 5.8 per cent to Y1,078.6bn, but new orders were down
27.6 per cent to Y900.7bn in the same period, pointing to tough times ahead
for Kumagai.
Japanese contractors have reported a fall in orders due to a decline in
corporate capital spending and the domestic property market slump, but
Kumagai's position is made more complex by its exposure to lossmaking
ventures in the UK and US.
The Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan is transferring the former head of its
London branch to Kumagai to head its international operations. He will join
an executive from Sumitomo Bank who is responsible for restructuring the
domestic business, badly bruised by the collapse of property prices.
Kumagai aims to sell Y300bn in properties over five years to reduce its
debt, but the poor health of the domestic and international markets has
meant few sales. Profits on its property business fell 69 per cent to Y4.3bn
last year.
The company must refinance Y64.2bn in warrant bonds this year. It made extra
profits last year by selling off long-term stock holdings which, on book
value, were down from Y35.3bn to Y16.7bn.
Kumagai forecast that sales would fall by about 10 per cent to Y900bn this
year, while pre-tax profits will slide 70 per cent to Y9bn and net profits
by almost 90 per cent to Y1bn. Kumagai is to move management staff to its
sales division, while directors would take a 20 per cent pay cut and
managers would have special allowances halved. It hopes to reduce its debts
by at least Y200bn in the next two years.
