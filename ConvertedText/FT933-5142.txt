FT  04 SEP 93 / Fashion: The easy way of shopping


   By LUCIA VAN DER POST


WHEN THE catalogues start falling on the mat like autumn leaves it must be .
. . well, nearly autumn. Fatter and faster they are coming as mail order
goes booming on.
Those who enjoy shopping by mail, and ordering their entire autumn wardrobe
in one fell swoop, might find the new Next Directory just the job.
Whether you are looking for a pair of silvery earrings, some striped socks,
a casual shirt or a charcoal grey sweater, the Next Directory will have it.
In size and initial look it is rather like the bumper catalogues of old  -
fat, comprehensive and not all that discriminating. As it has increased in
size, it seems to have lost its strong identity - here is something for
everyone rather than a collection aimed specifically at Next man or woman.
Nevertheless, most of the essentials of the winter wardrobe are there: from
pinafore dresses to crepe fishtail skirts and sweetly-fitted cardigans - the
delicately knitted version at Pounds 39.99 looking to be a winner. Baby Next
is coming along nicely, too, with all manner of cute items for the toddler
set.
All the catalogue basics, from socks to bodies, seem excellently priced.
Ring 0345-100500 for details. If your tastes run to smaller, more edited
catalogues, then look out for Kingshill.
Launched earlier this year with a small collection of British designer
labels (Caroline Charles, Paul Costelloe and Amanda Wakeley) two new names
have been added for autumn - Georgina von Etzdorf (every fashion editor
surely has a von Etzdorf scarf) and Belville Sassoon (for evening wear).
For a copy of Kingshill, The British Designers Collection, tel: 0494-890555
or fax: 0494-866003. The cover price of Pounds 4.50 is refunded against the
first order placed. Be warned, though, that designer labelprices are
altogether different from those at Next.
