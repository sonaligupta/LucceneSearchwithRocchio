FT  02 NOV 93 / Observer: Lack of the Irish


The London office of the European Parliament, doing its bit to celebrate the
onset of Maastricht, yesterday invited an expat from each of 10 states of
the European Community - sorry, Union - to talk to the press about their
new-found rights both to vote in next year's Euro-elections as well as to
participate in local polls at a later stage. Somehow missing from the
line-up was Ireland.
Joelle Garriaud-Maylam, elected representative of the French community in
the UK and Ireland, went on the defensive by explaining that, while
Ireland's ambassador had been invited, the Irish did not actually need to
take part in this particular celebration since 'for historical reasons' they
have had the vote in the UK for many years.
But this failed to satisfy one Irish member of the audience, who suggested
that they could have hastily substituted 'any Irish building labourer' in
the event of the ambassador's no-show. 'But I suppose alongside all those
lawyers and actors, that would have been a bit embarrassing.'
