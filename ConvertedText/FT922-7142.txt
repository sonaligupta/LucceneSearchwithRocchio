FT  20 MAY 92 / International Company News: Omron tumbles 51% despite better
sales


   By ROBERT THOMSON


OMRON, one of the world's leading makers of switches and other machine
control components, has reported a 51.2 per cent fall in pre-tax profit, to
Y13.55bn (Dollars 101.87m), for the year to the end of March. The company
blamed the decline on aggressive investment in research and the slowing of
the Japanese economy.
Sales rose 3.3 per cent to Y388.8bn, with sales in core control systems and
office equipment softened by the general reductions in capital spending by
Japanese companies. Demand remained strong for electronic fund transfer
systems; sales in this area rose 11 per cent.
The company has been confident that the fall in capital spending in recent
months will soon bottom, as Japanese industry needs to invest in
labour-saving technology and pollution-control equipment.
The downturn, however, has affected Omron, whose cash reserves fell from
Y99.58bn to Y68.59bn over the period, and whose unrealised gains on
long-term holdings of shares plunged from Y37.5bn to Y13.7bn.
These two trends are common at most leading Japanese companies, which
attempted to avoid higher interest rates last year by drawing down their
cash reserves. Companies' unrealised gains have been eroded by the stock
market collapse.
For this year, Omron is expecting a 3 per cent increase in sales, to Y400bn,
and flat pre-tax profit at Y13.5bn.
Rinnai, Japan's largest maker of gas home appliances, reported a 2.3 per
cent fall in pre-tax profit, to Y7bn, on a 3.7 per cent increase in sales to
Y113.9bn.
Demand for Rinnai's products was dampened by weakness in housing
construction, though sales of kitchen equipment rose by 3.8 per cent and of
water heaters by 3.1 per cent.
For the current year, pre-tax profit is forecast to be slightly higher at
Y7.1bn, with sales rising 3 per cent to Y117bn.
