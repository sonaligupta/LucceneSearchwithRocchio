FT  24 NOV 92 / Inflation rate at 4-year low in Italy


   By ROBERT GRAHAM


   ROME


ITALIAN inflation has fallen to its lowest level in four years and is now
running at 4.9 per cent on an annualised basis.
According to preliminary figures released by Istat, the national statistics
institute, consumer prices increased by a maximum of 0.6 per cent in the
main cities during November. Complete figures, due shortly, are considered
unlikely to show any significant variation.
This is the fourth successive month that inflation has dropped. Price rises
on an annualised basis have not been below 5 per cent since 1988.
Declining inflation reflects a combination of capped public sector wages,
frozen utility tariffs and recession.
The impact of the September devaluation and subsequent float of the lira
outside the ERM has yet to be felt on inflation. The government is hoping
depressed domestic demand will limit inflationary pressures.
Yesterday, the industrialists' confederation, reported production down by
5.1 per cent this month on last November.
