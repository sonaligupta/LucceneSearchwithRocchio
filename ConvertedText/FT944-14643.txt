FT  21 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mixed forecast for timber


   By FRANCES WILLIAMS

The short-term outlook for the timber industry in Europe and North America
is bright as economic recovery gathers pace, the United Nations Economic
Commission for Europe says in its annual review of market prospects for
forest products.
It expects consumption and production of all forest products to rise in both
1994 and 1995, bolstering prices. However, this masks significant variations
within the region.
Output of sawn softwood in Europe is forecast to increase on average by 5.2
per cent to 72m cu m in 1994 and by 3.3 per cent to 74.5m cu m in 1995.
In North America, however, output and consumption are expected to decline
next year after rising in 1994.
The ECE says that while there are signs of recovery in some eastern European
countries, the forest sector remains severely depressed in Russia and other
members of the Commonwealth of Independent States.
A combination of lower Canadian and Russian exports to Europe, and higher
European exports to the Near East, North Africa and the Far East will make
Europe a net exporter of sawn softwood for the first time this year and
next, the ECE says.
Sawn softwood consumption, production and trade in Russia, which have
declined dramatically since 1990, are forecast to fall again in 1994 but may
improve slightly in 1995. The removal of subsidies has sharply increased
transport costs, forcing uneconomic production facilities in western and
central Siberia to shut down.
Russian production in 1994 is likely to slump to about 23m cu m, compared
with more than 90m cu m in the former Soviet Union in 1990. Exports are
forecast to fall to some 5m cu m in 1994 but rise to 8m cu m in 1995.
Sawn hardwood consumption in Europe, which has fallen for the past decade,
is rising again.
