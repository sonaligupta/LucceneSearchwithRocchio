FT  16 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Local authorities risk prejudging
Tupe issue


   From Mr TONY BALDRY MP


Sir, Your article 'Rule clash may force tendering change' (November 12)
contains several factual errors that unless corrected are bound to mislead.
There is no conflict between the transfer of undertakings regulations (Tupe)
and the EC Procurement Directives. Certainly, councils prejudging the Tupe
issue risk breaching those directives, which require fair competition
between contractors in different member states. Authorities cannot insist
that a contractor employs existing staff.
It is not for local authorities to dictate in advance whether Tupe applies
when they put their services out to tender. This will depend on the
contractor's proposals. Most local authorities are taking the proper
approach, allowing contractors bidding for local government work to put
forward their own ideas about the best way of carrying it out.
In March, the government issued guidance stating that the way the work is to
be done would determine whether the Tupe regulations would apply. Therefore,
it is not possible to decide whether Tupe applies until the contractors'
proposals are seen. We have issued further guidance to councils about this:
if they prejudge the issue, and restrict the range of proposals they are
prepared to entertain, I will not hesitate to use the powers available to me
in law to take action against them.
