FT  22 DEC 92 / Ian Maxwell told to pay Pounds 500,000


   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent


MR IAN MAXWELL was yesterday ordered by a High Court judge to pay Pounds
500,000 to the liquidators of Bishopsgate Investment Management, the former
manager of the Mirror Group pension funds.
The action brought against Mr Maxwell was similar to that brought against
his brother, Mr Kevin Maxwell, which ultimately left him as Britain's
biggest bankrupt.
The judge ruled that Mr Ian Maxwell had been in breach of his duty as a BIM
director by signing forms to transfer shares from BIM to Credit Suisse
without questioning the transaction. The Pounds 500,000 interim payment was
ordered until an assessment of the value of the shares is made. The judge
rejected an application by BIM's lawyers for Mr Maxwell to be summarily
liable for more than Pounds 400m of losses, arising from other transfers,
because he had played no active part in those transactions.
Lawyers for Mr Maxwell indicated in court that he might not be able to pay
the Pounds 500,000. If that were so, enforcement proceedings against Mr
Maxwell might lead to his being made bankrupt, too. His lawyers said they
were considering an appeal.
In an earlier affidavit, Mr Ian Maxwell said he only had limited knowledge
of BIM's operations and signed the stock transfer form for Credit Suisse
because he had relied on his brother having already signed it.
The judge said that was no answer. 'It is clear from his own evidence that
he neither sought nor obtained any explanation from Kevin Maxwell. In
particular, he neither sought nor obtained any assurance that the transfers
had been approved by the board.'
