FT  19 APR 94 / International Company News: Insurance interests boost Worms


   By ALICE RAWSTHORN

Worms, the French holding company, last year saw net profits rise by 25 per
cent to FFr714m (Dollars 122.46m), from FFr571m in 1992, due mainly to a
strong performance from its insurance interests.
Mr Nicholas Clive-Worms, chairman, said that the group had performed fairly
well last year and that, as it was in a net cash position, Worms was
considering plans for expansion.
He identified one of the likeliest areas for investment as insurance, where
it may add to its Athena Assurances business.
Athena last year performed well and increased its contribution to group net
profits by 26 per cent. The contribution from Demachy Worms, the bank, rose
by 8.2 per cent to FFr79m from FFr73m.
Worms also benefited from the capital gains yielded by last year's sale of
its interest in Financiere Truffaut, the luxury goods conglomerate, to Mr
Bernard Arnault, the chairman of the LVMH luxury goods group.
By contrast, Compagnie Nationale de Navigation, the shipping subsidiary,
made a net loss of FFr78m in 1993.
The Arc Union property company stayed in the red: albeit with a reduced loss
of FFr115m against FFr252m in 1992.
The contribution from Saint-Louis, the French food group which last week
merged its prepared meals business with that of BSN, slipped by 4 per cent.
Earnings per share rose to FFr21.70 in 1993 from FFr17.35 in 1992. The board
has proposed an increase in the net dividend to FFr7.50 from FFr7.00 over
the same period.
