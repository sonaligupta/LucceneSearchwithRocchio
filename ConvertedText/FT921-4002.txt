FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Government Statements): Easing in rules for
using cash accounting - VAT Briefs


THE chancellor announced a relaxation of the conditions for using cash
accounting from April 1 1992. Under this scheme companies with a turnover of
not more than Pounds 300,000 can account for VAT on the basis of cash paid
and received, rather than invoices.
In future, businesses will be able to use the scheme if their total amount
of outstanding VAT is Pounds 5,000 or less; currently the limit is Pounds
1,000. Businesses which have been unable to pay their VAT because of bad
debts or because they are obliged to give their customers extended periods
of credit will therefore benefit from this increase.
Cash accounting was introduced in 1987. At present, small businesses cannot
take part in the scheme if their total amount of outstanding VAT is more
than Pounds 1,000.
Arrangements should be made with Customs to clear the debt; if these have
not been agreed proposals should be included with applications to join the
scheme.
A total of 135,000 businesses already use cash accounting out of around
400,000 which would be likely to benefit from doing so.
Registration move
The limits for VAT registration and cancellation of registration are
proposed to be increased in line with inflation. The annual registration
limit is being increased in line with inflation from Pounds 35,000 to Pounds
36,600.
The limit for those considering cancellation of their registration will be
increased in line with inflation from Pounds 33,600 to Pounds 35,100 from
May 1 1992.
Help for charities
A package of further VAT reliefs, worth up to Pounds 3m in a full year, was
proposed for charities and handicapped persons. From April 1 1992, these
changes will take effect:
zero-rating will be allowed for the repair and maintenance of equipment used
by the 'Talking Books for the Blind' service;
zero-rating will be extended to the provision of toilet facilities in any
charity-run building used for charitable purposes;
zero-rating will be extended to boats built or substantially adapted for use
by the handicapped;
zero-rating will be extended to spare parts and accessories supplied to sea
rescue charities.
Gift rules changed
VAT registered traders who wish to make donations of goods or assets to
educational establishments should in future have to account for VAT only on
the current value of such items.
