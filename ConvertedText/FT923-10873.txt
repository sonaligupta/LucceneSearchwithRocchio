FT  28 JUL 92 / Former aide to Collor rebuts corruption claims


   By REUTER


   BRASILIA


A FORMER private secretary to Brazilian President Fernando Collor jumped to
the president's defence in testimony before Congress yesterday and denied Mr
Collor had profited personally from a corruption scandal that threatens the
future of his government, Reuter reports from Braslia
'I have come to prove beyond the shadow of doubt that the president financed
his household expenses with his own resources,' Mr Claudio Vieira said.
He had been called to explain the source of money deposited in the bank
account of Ms Ana Acioli, Mr Collor's personal secretary, who later used it
to pay for the president's household expenses.
Mr Vieira said the money was part of a Dollars 5m (Pounds 2.6m) loan taken
by Mr Collor from a Uruguayan financial group to help fund his presidential
bid.
