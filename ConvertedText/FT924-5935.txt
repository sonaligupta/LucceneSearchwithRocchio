FT  24 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Security side behind ADT's 82% third
quarter increase


   By RICHARD GOURLAY


ADT, the security and car auction group, yesterday reported an 82 per cent
increase in pre-tax profits for the third quarter and a doubling of earnings
per share.
The Bermuda-based company which does much of its business in the US but
retains a UK quote, increased pre-tax profits from Dollars 23m to Dollars
41.9m (Pounds 27.7m) on sales up 14 per cent at Dollars 336m.
Earnings per share rose from 15 cents to 33 cents. The share price jumped
40p to 500p.
Mr Michael Ashcroft, chairman and chief executive, said that in the absence
of unforeseen circumstances, combined operating income from core vehicle
auction and security systems for1992 should exceed the 1991 result.
The main operating increase was in the security division where profits rose
from Dollars 27.9m to Dollars 37.2m. The division benefited from a high
volume residential sales programme in North America and a reduction in
overheads as central control stations continued to be consolidated.
The commercial security market was showing early signs of improvement in the
US Midwest, south-east and west regions.
Operating profit in the auctions division was marginally up at Dollars 15.5m
on sales almost unchanged at Dollars 80.2m. The division suffered from the
decrease in manufacturers' vehicles sales in the US and a slow down in
demand for used cars in the UK. ADT said there were indications that the
downturn in the UK vehicle market had levelled out.
ADT's 'other expenses less income' line moved from a net expense of Dollars
6.8m in the second quarter of 1992 to a net contribution of Dollars 600,000,
due to what ADT called 'the generation of Dollars 5.7m of operating income
by the company's highly seasonal non-core activities'. These were expected
to produce a small operating loss in the fourth quarter.
