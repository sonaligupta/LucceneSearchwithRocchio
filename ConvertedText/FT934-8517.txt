FT  15 NOV 93 / International Company News: Mitsui Fudosan suffers downturn


   By EMIKO TERAZONO


MITSUI Fudosan, a leading Japanese real estate developer, saw sharp falls in
profits for the half year to September due to sluggish earnings by its
office leasing division, writes Emiko Terazono.
Unconsolidated pre-tax profits fell by 45.3 per cent to Y9.5bn (Dollars
89.5m) on a 13.4 per cent decline in revenues to Y343.4bn. After-tax profits
fell 18.6 per cent to Y7.4bn.
The office leasing unit saw lower revenues, due to thinner profit margins
and a loss of Y5bn caused by a rise in cancellations of contracts, and the
occupancy rate for its offices totalled 93.4 per cent at end-September, down
from 95.7 per cent at end-March.
