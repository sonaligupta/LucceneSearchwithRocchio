FT  30 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Ministers to discuss fears over
court cases


   By IVOR OWEN


PUBLIC CONCERN at the number of cases considered by the Crown prosecution
service which do not lead to court proceedings was acknowledged by Mr David
Maclean, home office minister, last night, Ivor Owen writes.
Before the Criminal Justice Bill received its third Commons reading, he said
he would discuss the matter with ministerial colleagues, adding: 'This is
something we will want to discuss with the Crown prosecution service.'
A Labour clause seeking to introduce a code of practice on liaison between
the courts, the police and local authorities was defeated by a government
majority of 47 (278-231).
