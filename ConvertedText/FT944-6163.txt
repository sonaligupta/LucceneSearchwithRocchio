FT  30 NOV 94 / Kleinwort to advise on Chile sale


   By NICHOLAS DENTON


Kleinwort Benson, the UK investment bank, this week begins advising Codelco
Chile, the state copper producer, on the privatisation of its Dollars 500m
(Pounds 304m) Tocopilla power generating division.
The Tocopilla sale is set to be the largest electricity privatisation in
South America since Argentina completed its sell-off and competition between
advisers was intense.
Kleinwort emerged from a field of 17 investment banks and a shortlist of
three that included its UK rival on electricity deals, NM Rothschild, and CS
First Boston of the US.
Codelco and Kleinwort have to decide on the stake to be offered to outside
investors, expected to be a majority, and the method of sale. The management
of the Chilean state company are understood to prefer an offer for sale but
a trade sale to an international electricity company is also a possibility.
Kleinwort said it expected to complete a review of options by early 1995
with a view to a transaction in the late spring or early summer. An
international offering would have to be timed to avoid clashing with the
sale of shares in the UK's national grid and generating companies, and
several other electricity privatisations scheduled for next year.
The valuation of Tocopilla depends heavily on the contract it strikes with
Codelco, which consumes two thirds of its output. However the coal and oil
fired power station's capacity of 570MW points to a worth of about Dollars
500m.
The outcome of the Tocopilla 'beauty contest' between investment banks
reinforces the dominance of the electricity sector by Kleinwort and NM
Rothschild since they worked on UK electricity privatisation.
