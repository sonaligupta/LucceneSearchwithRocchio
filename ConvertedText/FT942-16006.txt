FT  12 APR 94 / International Company News: Cariplo lifts group net profits
to L323bn


   By ANDREW HILL


Net group profits at Cariplo, Italy's largest savings bank, increased 4.2
per cent in 1993 to L323bn (Dollars 196.95m), compared with L310bn in 1992.
Gross earnings increased 22.4 per cent to L2,375bn, before provisions and
adjustments, while total assets grew 9.3 per cent to L150,893bn.
Cariplo shareholders yesterday backed the nomination of Mr Sandro Molinari,
the bank's chief executive, as chairman. His predecessor, Mr Roberto
Mazzotta, stepped down because he faces charges of corruption relating to
property transactions by the bank's pension fund.
Overall deposits in the group rose by 13 per cent in 1993 to L122,536bn,
while total loans increased to L134,607bn, a rise of 11 per cent.
Mr Giampiero Pesenti, the Italian industrialist, has increased his group's
stake in Credito Italiano, the recently privatised Italian bank, to 2.99 per
cent, the maximum allowed. The Pesenti group previously held 2.88 per cent
through Luxembourg-based Franco Tosi International.
On Saturday Credito's new shareholders will get their first chance to
influence the direction of the bank when they elect a board of directors.
