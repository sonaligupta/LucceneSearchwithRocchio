FT  30 APR 94 / World News in Brief: Pope breaks leg in fall at Vatican


Pope John Paul II was recovering in a Rome hospital after surgeons inserted
a metal replacement for the head and neck of his femur, fractured in a fall
in his bathroom. The Pope, 73, will need to spend about three weeks in bed
and postponed a planned visit to Belgium. It was his second fall in six
months, and renewed concern among his advisers about his demanding schedule.
