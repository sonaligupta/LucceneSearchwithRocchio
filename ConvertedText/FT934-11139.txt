FT  02 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Grand Central falls Pounds 745,500 into red


Grand Central Investment Holdings, the food group with interests in Asia
Pacific, fell Pounds 745,500 into the red in the six months to June 30.
That compared with a profit of Pounds 1.01m last time and was struck on
turnover up from Pounds 29.8m to Pounds 32.9m.
The decline was due to the closure of the Singapore manufacturing plant and
its relocation to Malaysia and Indonesia coupled with the continued downturn
in performance of commodity-related operations, the directors said.
Losses per share were 1.27p (1.47p earnings). There is no dividend this time
(0.45p).
