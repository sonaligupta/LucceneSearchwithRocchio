FT  05 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Age trap


   By JENNIE HAWTHORNE


Age has an important bearing on your income and tax. The most well known of
these effects is the age allowance. For people between 65-74, this is an
addition of Pounds 755 (93/94 figures) to the Pounds 3,445 personal
allowance (which everybody gets against any tax liability), and brings it up
to Pounds 4,200.
The personal allowance for single people aged 75 or over is higher at Pounds
4,370, and married couples get an extra Pounds 2,465 (65-74) or Pounds 2,505
(75 or over).
But what the Inland Revenue gives in one hand, it tends to take back with
the other. An income limit for the age allowance starts operating at Pounds
14,200.
When that figure is reached, every Pounds 2 of taxable income thereafter
reduces the age allowance by Pounds 1 until it gets down to the basic
personal allowance to which everybody, from birth upwards, is entitled.
For purposes of calculating the age allowance, all income is grossed up. And
it is on this gross amount that your tax liability (after allowances) is
assessed. Adding up your total income - on much of which you have paid tax
at source - can, therefore, give you a false idea of your tax liability.
Few payments are tax-free, even when received gross. It is easy to fall into
the age allowance trap, therefore, as the following example shows.
John and his wife Ann, both aged 66, have annual incomes of Pounds 15,000
and Pounds 10,000 respectively. She gets the Pounds 4,200 allowance but
John's income exceeds the age limit of Pounds 14,200 by Pounds 800.
Thus, he loses Pounds 400 (Pounds 800/2) from his Pounds 4,200 allowance,
and it goes down to Pounds 3,800.
His taxable income is, therefore, Pounds 15,000 less allowances of Pounds
6,265 - made up of Pounds 3,800 (personal) plus Pounds 2,465 (married).
Assuming he has no other offsetting allowances, John must pay tax on Pounds
15,000 less Pounds 6,265: that is, Pounds 8,730, instead of tax on Pounds
8,330.
