FT  04 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei, Pacific Rim
register new highs

THE Nikkei index hit a new high for the year as the second section debut of
DDI, the telecom company, encouraged sentiment, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
Buying by foreign investors and index-linked purchases took the Nikkei up
133.01 to 21,116.21; it opened at the day's low of 20,984.50 and advanced to
a high of 21,281.03 in the afternoon session.
Volume jumped from 364m shares to 480m, topping 400m for the first time
since August 13. Advances led declines by 576 to 448 with 169 unchanged and
the Topix index of all first section stocks advanced 4.69 to 1,698.67, a new
high for the year. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 3.07 to 1,305.07.
DDI saw strong buying interest and the stock fetched an initial price of
Y5.5m, sharply higher than its public offering price of Y3.7m. Its strong
growth prospects, compared to those of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone,
encouraged investors and the issue closed at Y5.41m.
Rumours that Yamaichi Securities would incur losses, because of irregular
sales of US mortgage funds, dampened sentiment in the afternoon. However,
strong buying supported blue chips and the overall index managed to sustain
its gains.
In spite of the popularity of DDI, NTT closed down Y14,000 to Y955,000 on
profit-taking. Yamaichi plunged Y19 to Y824. After the market closed the
broker said that it would pay up to Y10bn in damages to customers who
suffered losses due to misinformation by Yamaichi's sales staff. However,
other brokers were higher, with Nomura Securities up Y30 to Y2,200 and Nikko
Securities gaining Y30 to Y1,370.
Large capital stocks were lower on profit-taking. Nippon Steel fell Y11 to
Y364 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries lost Y7 to Y683.
In Osaka, the OSE average gained 75.68 to 23,035.67 in volume of 66.2m
shares. The index rose above the 23,000 level for the first time since June
11.
