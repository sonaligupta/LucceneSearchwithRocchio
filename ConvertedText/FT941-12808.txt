FT  28 JAN 94 / Investment trusts double savings inflow


   By BETHAN HUTTON and ALISON SMITH


The flow of money into investment trusts through savings schemes more than
doubled last year, reflecting private investors' switch to equities in an
attempt to beat low interest rates.
A total of Pounds 239.61m was invested through savings schemes last year, a
107 per cent rise from 1992. The shift was particularly evident in the
fourth quarter, when a record Pounds 73.12m was invested, a 13 per cent
increase from the third quarter.
Mr Ernest Fenton, director-general of the Association of Investment Trust
Companies, said: 'Investors are clearly looking for good value alternatives
to increase returns over the long term, especially in the light of low
interest rates.'
The figures offer further evidence of the fierce competition for savings
which has contributed to building societies suffering a net outflow of
retail deposits in the second half of last year.
They come just one day after it emerged that private investors accounted for
Pounds 5bn of the record Pounds 9.1bn invested in unit trusts last year.
Societies point out that for 1993 as a whole they recorded a net inflow of
Pounds 2.2bn in retail funds - a clear improvement on the Pounds 295m inflow
in 1992. Even so, this is significantly below the Pounds 5.8bn and Pounds
6.6bn inflows they received in 1991 and 1990 respectively.
Investment trust shares are traditionally bought in batches through
stockbrokers, in the same way as any other company's shares. But 10 years
ago the largest investment trust, Foreign & Colonial, introduced a regular
savings scheme which allowed investors to put relatively small amounts of
money - from about Pounds 25 a month - towards building up a holding in the
trust. Schemes are now run by 36 management companies, covering 155
investment trusts. The average monthly saving is Pounds 80.
Savings schemes spread purchases across the peaks and troughs of the stock
market, so that savers do not risk putting all their money in at the top of
the market and seeing their investment fall in value immediately. The
schemes also tend to prop up trusts' share prices by providing a steady
source of demand.
