American Airlines, the second biggest US carrier, faces the threat of a
strike by its 21,000 flight attendants following the collapse of talks on a
cost-cutting pay and conditions deal at the weekend, writes Richard Tomkins
in Dallas.
The strike, due to start on November 22, the Monday before the busy
Thanksgiving holiday weekend, could bring chaos for air travellers.
