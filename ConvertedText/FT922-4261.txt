FT  06 JUN 92 / International Company News: Du Pont expected to take charge
of at least Dollars 100m

   NEW YORK


DU PONT, the leading US chemicals group, is expected to record an
extraordinary second quarter after-tax charge of Dollars 100m to Dollars
135m as a result of settlements of claims by horticultural growers that the
company's Benlate DF anti-fungus product has damaged crops.
The charge, based on the company's announcement yesterday that it expected a
second-quarter charge against earnings of 15 to 20 cents a share, would
bring total fungicide payments by Du Pont to between Dollars 315m and
Dollars 350m on an after-tax basis.
Last year, Du Pont took a charge of 32 cents a share after-tax, or Dollars
215m, because of fungicide claims.
Analysts expect the special charge could reduce expected second-quarter
earnings of Du Pont from Dollars 571m, or 85 cents a share, to around
Dollars 436m, or 65 cents. The company's first-quarter earnings declined by
18 per cent to Dollars 482m.
The fungicide powder was withdrawn from the US market in March 1991 after
flower growers and other agricultural customers complained of plant damage
resulting from the product, known as Benlate dry flowable.
Mr William Kirk, general manager of Du Pont's agricultural products
division, said some claims rejected by the company were still being pursued
by growers in legal actions. However, he predicted that 90 per cent of the
claims would be settled or rejected by the company by the end of June.
The fungicide is estimated to have accounted for about Dollars 125m of
annual revenues before it was taken off the market. Analysts estimate that
total 1991 revenues of Du Pont's agricultural products division were about
Dollars 1.8bn.
In Florida, state agricultural officials are believed to be investigating a
series of complaints from growers that they have suffered harmful health
effects from the Benlate product. The product has been widely used on
ornamental plants, vegetables and other crops to prevent fungus growth.
