FT  02 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Mid Kent Holdings buys Linkclever


Mid Kent Holdings, the water supply company, has acquired the Linkclever
group of companies, including CRI - its radio and telemetry data collection,
transfer and control arm.
The maximum possible cost of the purchase is Pounds 4.4m. However, on
current profit projections, the board estimates that the actual amount will
be about Pounds 3.3m in cash.
MKH will pay Pounds 2.5m - Pounds 2.1m on completion with a balance of up to
Pounds 400,000 dependent on the audited net asset value of CRI at the
completion date. Thereafter, a profits-related payment of up to Pounds 1.9m
is payable.
CRI estimates that the additional amount will not exceed Pounds 800,000.
