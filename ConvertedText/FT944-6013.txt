FT  01 DEC 94 / World Trade News: WTO perks row delays HQ


   By FRANCES WILLIAMS


   GENEVA


Continued disagreement over diplomatic perks is delaying completion of the
formal headquarters agreement between the Swiss authorities and the future
World Trade Organisation. Trade officials say the accord may now not be
finalised before the WTO comes into effect on January 1. At a meeting
yesterday of the WTO preparatory committee, Mr Andras Szepesi, Hungary's
Gatt ambassador, said progress had been made on such issues as
accommodation, conference facilities and car parking. However, there had
been little headway on the treatment of WTO staff and country delegations in
Geneva. Last summer Geneva won the WTO headquarters site in a contest with
Bonn after promising more generous treatment of diplomats. The Swiss
authorities deny they are backtracking on these pledges but say the matter
of diplomatic perks should be separate from the WTO accord.
