FT  28 APR 94 / UK Company News: GRT is valued at Pounds 57.2m via 160p
placing price


   By PAUL TAYLOR


Shares in GRT, the bus and coach operator which is coming to market through
a placing with institutional investors, were priced yesterday at 160p,
valuing the Aberdeen-based group at Pounds 57.2m.
A total of 13.7m shares, representing just over 38 per cent of the expanded
capital, are being placed by James Capel, of which 11.25m will be placed on
behalf of the company.
The management and employees are expected to retain about 56.3 per cent of
the enlarged equity.
The placing will raise Pounds 17m net of expenses for the company. Of this
Pounds 10.6m will be used to repay bank borrowings, and the balance will
help finance future investments and acquisitions.
GRT, which runs local bus and coach services mainly in the north-east and
central belt of Scotland, as well as Leicester and Northampton, is one of
the the fastest growing operators in the industry.
In the five years since its formation through a management buy-out of
Grampian Regional Council's bus and coach undertakings, the business has
grown from 242 buses in Aberdeen to 723 buses operating in four main areas
in the UK.
The prospectus, which was issued yesterday, also includes an estimate that
operating profits in the 52 weeks to March 26 increased from Pounds 3.8m to
Pounds 5m, on turnover of Pounds 39.7m (Pounds 32m).
The latest figures include initial contributions from Northampton Transport,
which was acquired in October and Leicester CityBus, acquired in November.
