FT  08 NOV 94 / International Company News: Generale des Eaux struggle
deepens

The struggle over the succession to Mr Guy Dejouany, president of Compagnie
Generale des Eaux, intensified yesterday. Mr Jacques Calvet, the head of
Peugeot who is a member of the Generale des Eaux board, reaffirmed his
opposition to Mr Dejouany's plan to put a 37-year-old outsider at the top of
the French communications and utility group.
It became evident that Mr Calvet has support from some of the group's 12
outside directors in his objection to the plan by Mr Dejouany, 73, to anoint
Mr Jean-Marie Messier, the managing partner of Lazard Freres, the merchant
bank, as his dauphin and eventual successor.
Mr Calvet held a long meeting with Mr Dejouany on the succession yesterday.
Neither Generale des Eaux nor Peugeot would comment on the outcome. But
Generale des Eaux said negotiations with Mr Messier were advanced and would
be put to the full board this month.
Mr Calvet's spokeswoman at Peugeot reiterated her president's feeling that
'a young man of 37 with no industrial experience could not, however
brilliant, move directly to the top of a group such as Generale des Eaux
with 200,000 employees, without first serving some kind of apprenticeship to
learn the business'.
Mr Messier was the official in charge of privatisation when Mr Edouard
Balladur was finance minister in 1986-88, and he is considered by many as a
Balladur man, as is Mr Ambroise Roux, vice-president on the Generale des
Eaux board.
The Cob, the French bourse watchdog, yesterday said it had fined Mr Jacques
Fournier, a former board member of Lyonnaise des Eaux, the construction and
utilities group, FFr40,000 (Dollars 7,812) for abuse of privileged
information in trading the company's shares. Mr Fournier said he would
appeal.
