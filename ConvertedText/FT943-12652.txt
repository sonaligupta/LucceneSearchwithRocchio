FT  23 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Corporate results fail to
spur Dow


   By FRANK MCGURTY


   NEW YORK


Wall Street
US share prices meandered in lacklustre trading yesterday as the heavy flow
of corporate results flooding into Wall Street this week eased, writes Frank
McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 2.59 firmer at 3,735.04, while the
more broadly based Standard & Poor's 500 was a scant 0.50 ahead at 453.11.
Volume on the Big Board was moderate, with 262m shares exchanged by the
close.
In the secondary markets, the American SE composite edged 0.21 ahead to
433.45, while the Nasdaq composite added 1.64 to 716.67.
The Dow industrials opened modestly higher, but most stocks quickly
retreated to near their opening values and stagnated.
The narrow range in which share prices moved reflected an over-riding sense
of caution which has gripped the market since Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal
Reserve chairman, appeared before the senate banking committee on Wednesday.
His testimony caught the financial markets by surprise by suggesting an
imminent move to lift interest rates was likely.
In the second leg of Mr Greenspan's Humphery-Hawkins economic briefing
yesterday morning, the Fed chief delivered much the same message to the
House banking committee as he had given earlier in the week. With Mr
Greenspan saying nothing to calm investors' rekindled fear of a rate
increase, the market remained in a torpor.
The downward tilt paralleled the morning's action in bonds, where prices
softened in trad ing held to a minimum by the approach to a summer's
weekend. There was no fresh economic data on offer to influence sentiment.
But the session was not entirely without spark. Individual stocks rose and
fell with the release of the quarterly results of a few leading
corporations. Among the Dow Jones industrials, McDonald's dropped Dollars 2
to Dollars 26 1/4 on heavy volume of 4.8m shares. The downturn was a delayed
response to the fast-food chain's earnings announcement, which had elicited
a muted response the previous session. After digesting the figures, at least
two Wall Street securities houses - Merrill Lynch and Montgomery -
downgraded the issue.
On the positive side, USX-US Steel climbed Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 37. The
group had released details of a strong second-quarter after the market
closed on Thursday.
In the computer sector, Apple Computer followed IBM's blockbuster results
with an impressive second-quarter performance of its own. The stock jumped
Dollars 3 to Dollars 31 as the company posted underly ing earnings of 50
cents a share, against a consensus forecast of 35 cents.
IBM, off Dollars 1 at Dollars 61 3/8 , was hurt by profit-taking, but many
technology stocks showed improvement. Storage Technology was marked up
Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 36 5/8 after publishing better-than-expected
results. However, Compaq Computer shed Dollars 1 to Dollars 30 5/8 .
Canada
Toronto eased in quiet midday trading with little news expected to jolt the
market out of its summer doldrums and Mr Alan Greenspan's comments on his
last day of congressional testimony having little impact.
The TSE 300 was 2.70 lower at 4,169.90 in moderate volume of 14.85m shares.
Declines outpaced advances 81 to 73, with 104 stocks steady.
Mexico
Mexican shares ended sharply higher as investors responded positively to
second quarter earnings by heavily-weighted Telefonos de Mexico, traders
said.
The IPC index of 37 top shares rose 67.85 points, a gain of 3.04 per cent,
to end at 2,
On Thursday Telmex reported net profit of 4.40bn pesos for the first half
compared with 4.43bn a year ago. Revenues were up to 13.84bn pesos from
12.34bn.
Despite the sharp advance in the index, turnover was an uninspired 59.8m
valued at 680.3m pesos.
