FT  11 MAR 94 / International Company News: Lafarge Coppee rises 26% for
year

Lafarge Coppee, the French construction materials group, yesterday announced
a 26 per cent increase in net profit, to FFr1.55bn (Dollars 267.2m), for
1993. Turnover was slightly lower at FFr30.43bn. It is holdings its net
dividend at FFr9 per share.
The group benefited last year from the return to profit of its American
subsidiary, Lafarge Corporation and from a better return on its investments
in central Europe. These offset the effects of recession in France.
It predicted that the strengthening of its capital base would continue, with
a possible FFr1.3bn increase in shareholder funds from the conversion of
bonds and another FFr1.5bn from exercised share warrants.
As a result, the group said it planned to step up investments this year, to
between FFr5bn and FFr7bn, from FFr5.5bn this year. This was to increase its
presence on particularly promising international markets around the
Mediterranean, Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Mr Bertrand Collomb, president, said the group had been prospecting the
Chinese market, which seemed re-opened to French companies following Paris's
promise to Peking to sell no more offensive arms to Taiwan.
