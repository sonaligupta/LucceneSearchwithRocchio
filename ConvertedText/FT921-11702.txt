   By Our Foreign Staff


Zimbabwe has reached agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on
an SDR344m (Pounds 269m) three-year loan in support of the government's
1992-94 economic reform programme, our foreign staff report.
The agreement, announced by the IMF this week, provides for tightening of
fiscal and monetary policies, the maintenance of a competitive exchange
