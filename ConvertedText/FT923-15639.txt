FT  01 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Move from cyclical to
defensive stocks


   By Our Markets Staff


FOLLOWING Monday's 3.8 per cent drop in Hoogovens in Amsterdam, steels
dropped across the board in Frankfurt yesterday in what was perceived as a
move out of cyclicals, and into defensive stocks, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT reported institutional selling of carmakers and engineers as well
as steels. Turnover rose from DM4.7bn to DM5.7bn as gains in banks, and two
of the three big utility stocks gave the market some stability in aggregate.
After a 3.24 fall to 693.61 in the FAZ index at midsession, the DAX closed
4.49 lower at 1,752.63. Dealers said that cyclicals had had a good run:
Volkswagen dropped DM7 to DM376.50 and Degussa, its chemicals and metals
refining activities regarded as a cyclical play, by DM12.50 to DM345.
Thyssen led steels down with a fall of DM7.70 to DM229.70. Mr Glen Liddy of
Kleinwort Benson, who put out a sell recommendation on the stock last week,
said that Thyssen had outperformed a relatively strong market by almost 5
per cent since the beginning of 1992, pushing the immediately prospective
p/e up to 17 compared with a five-year average of 10.3. He worried, too,
that overcapacity in western Europe will be exacerbated by the ability of
former eastern bloc countries to bring product into the west at less than
economic prices.
Among defensive stocks banks and utilities mostly showed gentle increases,
although among the latter Viag fell another DM2.70 to DM390, its basic
attractions obscured by a turndown at its Schmalbach-Lubeca packaging
subsidiary, whose shares fell another DM10 to DM464.
In retailing, Asko, a byword for high balance sheet gearing, was suspended
at Monday's DM745 as it brought its annual news conference forward to
tomorrow. A spokesman said that the supervisory board would decide today on
the need for additional risk provisions.
MILAN fell further in gloomy trading as dealers despaired of the total lack
of interest from domestic investors. Foreigners, worried by currency
devaluation fears, continued to sell. The Comit index fell 6.4 or 1.4 per
cent to 454.16 in turnover estimated at between L80bn-L100bn after L71.2bn
on Monday.
Dealers feared that if the current malaise continued, the index could fall
as low as 420, last seen in early February 1988. June mutual fund data, due
out in the next few days, are expected to be poor, they added.
Among leading blue chips, Generali lost L500 to L27,700 while Fiat dropped
L156 to L5,288. Olivetti remained weak, losing L53 to L3,136. Italgas, which
had been weak recently as investors switched into Snam, fell L127 to L2,783
on fears that Monday's assassination of Algeria's head of state could lead
to a disruption of supplies of natural gas.
PARIS, quiet for most of the day, was buffetted in the final hour by the
expiry of options and futures. The CAC 40 index, which went as high as
1,915.59 and as low as 1,883.12, closed 6.67 lower at 1,900.63. Volume,
which had reached only FFr1bn by 3 pm, jumped to FFr4bn by the close on
option and futures-related activity.
Alcatel Alsthom was one of the most active stocks, losing FFr4 to FFr649
while Elf added FFr4.90 to FFr377.30. Among smaller stocks, L'Oreal fell
FFr17 to FFr910 while Valeo, which has seen several put-throughs of stock
recently, lost FFr6 to FFr780.
MADRID's general index closed a mere 0.81 lower at 238.31, but that was
enough to take it to a new 1992 low. Meanwhile there were serious losses in
the construction sector where Cubiertas dropped Pta520, or 6.3 per cent to
Pta7,780 and Valderrivas by Pta760, or 9.1 per cent to Pta7,520.
Spain's budget deficit was now looking extremely serious, said Mr Miguel
Olabarri at Schroder Securities, and that made for a very poor outlook for
the construction industry, with the government as its biggest customer.
ZURICH was led higher by chemicals, Ciba-Geigy bearers rising SFr40 to
SFr3,320 as the SMI index rose 8.2 to 1,854.8 but the market also had to
absorb Swissair's news of an 'unsatisfactory' start to 1992. The airline's
shares fell another SFr28 to a new 1992 low of SFr635.
AMSTERDAM ended barely changed, though a steady dollar helped most
internationals to close with small gains. The CBS Tendency Index fell 0.1 to
123.6.
KLM lost 70 cents to Fl 35.70 after the airline said it had made an
unspecified first quarter profit, but that earnings were lower than hoped.
The steel and aluminium maker, Hoogovens, fell another Fl 1.00 to Fl 49.30
following last Friday's news that it planned to reduce its 1992 investment
programme.
ISTANBUL's index rose for the seventh consecutive day, piercing the 4,400
level for its best close in nearly five months. The index added 42.19 to
4,407.23, after an intraday high of 4,478.
