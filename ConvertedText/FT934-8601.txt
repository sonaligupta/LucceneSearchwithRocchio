FT  15 NOV 93 / Slide in business starts dents confidence


   By PETER MARSH


CONCERN THAT the recovery may be weakening has re-emerged as a result of a
slowing in the rate of growth of new companies.
Registrations of new companies last month were only just above the number in
October last year, after a sharp rise in the formation rate in the first
nine months of 1993.
Jordans, the Bristol-based business information company that compiled the
figures, said the slowdown was 'a cause for concern' on the basis that
company starts were normally a good indicator.
On the basis of data provided to Jordans by Companies House, 9,359 companies
were started last month. The figure - which applies to the UK excluding
Northern Ireland - was only fractionally above the 9,339 start-ups
registered in the corresponding month last year.
In both September and August new company formations were up by about 11 per
cent compared with 12 months previously. In the first three-quarters of the
year registrations were up 6.1 per cent on the same period last year.
One interpretation of the figures is that anxiety about possible tax rises
in the Budget, and concern that weak demand in continental Europe is holding
back the recovery, may be leading to a decline in entrepreneurial activity.
According to Jordans, London and the south account for more than half of
business starts, with inner London the registered office base of nearly 30
per cent of new companies.
Outside London and the south the only region to come anywhere close to a
double-figure percentage of all start-ups is the north-west, which accounts
for about 8 per cent of new registrations.
So far this year the south-west, eastern England, the West Midlands and
Scotland have each accounted for about 6 per cent of new starts.
Jordans said: 'New business starts-ups over the last 12 months have been
fairly consistently spread, perhaps suggesting that most regional time lags
and differences have been squeezed out after the prolonged period of
recession.'
