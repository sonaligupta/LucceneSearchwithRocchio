FT  20 APR 94 / North produces pattern of faltering recovery


   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent


A pattern of faltering economic recovery appears to be emerging in the north
of England, following publication yesterday of the third northern economic
survey in five days - covering Cumbria and the north-east.
Domestic sales fell back sharply in the first quarter but export deliveries
showed their strongest upward movement for five quarters. The pattern for
orders was similar, although the dip in home markets was less than for
sales.
The survey of 634 companies was carried out by the Northern Development
Company and the Teesside and Tyne and Wear Chambers of Commerce. It mirrors
similar surveys published on Friday and Monday by chambers in north-west
England,Yorkshire and Humberside.
Although profit forecasts fell slightly, only 8 per cent of companies expect
turnover to fall and only 22 per cent said cash flow was worsening.
Confidence, which had dipped in the fourth quarter of last year, was
therefore largely restored.
This was reflected in increased investment in buildings, as well as plant
and machinery, although two-thirds of companies left their investment plans
unchanged.
There was also a pick-up in employment trends, with 29 per cent taking on
staff compared with 17 per cent shedding labour. Only 9 per cent of those
surveyed said they planned to cut jobs in the current quarter, although 63
per cent planned to stay the same size.
Recruitment difficulties remain, with 22 per cent of manufacturers reporting
skill shortages.
The trend in training expenditure fell back slightly, but was still
positive. Companies that increased their spending on training outnumbered
those that had made cuts by 25 per cent.
Mr Bob Tilmouth, chief executive of Tyne and Wear Chamber of Commerce, said:
'Things do appear to be improving, but it certainly is a long haul.'
