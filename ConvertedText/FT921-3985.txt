AEG, the Daimler-Benz subsidiary, has sold the remnants of its domestic
Olympia office equipment division to Mr Jurgen Sievers, a consultant called
in last year to advise the German engineering company on how to get rid of
the loss-making business.
Mr Sievers will take over at the end of this year when the planned run-down
of manufacturing at Wilhelmshaven in north Germany is completed. The
company, currently AEG-Olympia, will be re-named Olympia Office.
The handover ensures the survival of one of the oldest brands in office
equipment although most of the jobs that Olympia provides will go.
