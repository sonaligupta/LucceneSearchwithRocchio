FT  16 JAN 92 / Work smoking bans set to spread


   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff


EMPLOYERS will have to provide separate no-smoking rest areas from the end
of the year or ban smoking in rest rooms altogether under rules being
brought in to comply with a European health and safety directive.
Pregnant women and nursing mothers will also, for the first time, have to be
provided with their own separate rest facilities at work under the
regulations.
An increasing number of organisations are moving towards workplace smoking
bans. These regulations could speed the process as employers decide it is
simpler to outlaw smoking altogether, rather than having to find separate
rest rooms for non-smokers.
The Health and Safety Executive, which published a consultation document on
the rules yesterday, said it would not be introducing more general
restrictions on smoking at work.
The 'prescriptive' measures relating to smoking and rest areas, as well as
the rules on rest areas for pregnant women, were not in line with British
legislation but had been imposed by the EC, the health body said.
The law surrounding smoking at work remains largely untested. The decision
of an industrial tribunal in Scotland, expected today, could mean extra
complications for employers in the introduction of workplace smoking bans.
A former nursing auxiliary in Glasgow, who said she could not endure eight
hours without a cigarette, is claiming constructive dismissal after the
health authority she worked for banned smoking.
No special provision was made in the building where she worked for smokers,
and there was no time to go out to smoke during meal-breaks, the tribunal
heard.
