FT  13 NOV 92 / More than 1,000 jobs to go at naval bases


   By DANIEL GREEN and BETHAN HUTTON


MORE THAN 1,000 jobs are to be shed at the Portsmouth and Portland naval
bases, the government announced yesterday.
Ship refitting at Portsmouth will cease by next summer, Mr Archie Hamilton,
armed forces minister, said in a written Commons reply. The work will be
done instead at the naval dockyards at Devonport near Plymouth and Rosyth,
Fife.
Mr Hamilton said 400 civilian jobs would be lost and some redundancies would
be 'unavoidable'.
The operational sea training base at Portland, Dorset, will close by April
1996 and its activities will move to Devonport. All 475 civilian jobs at
Portland will go, as will 130 of the 550 service jobs. The remaining service
personnel will be transferred.
The Ministry of Defence said many of the 605 staff who were to lose their
jobs at Portland would leave through natural wastage. The 130 service staff
cuts would be spread across all the services.
'It is similar to the closure of a coal mine,' said Mr Brian Ellis, chairman
of Weymouth and Portland Borough Council's policy and resources committee.
'The people of this community will be equally devastated.'
The defence industry and tourism have traditionally been the biggest local
employers. Mr Ellis said local unemployment had been below the national
average, but could now be expected to rise to about 16 per cent.
Mr Richard Trist, Portsmouth City Council chief executive, said: 'The whole
economy in the Portsmouth locality is very largely based on the defence of
the realm. We are suffering quite badly from the peace dividend at the
moment.'
