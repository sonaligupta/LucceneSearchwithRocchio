FT  22 APR 91 / Letter: Do not ignore the European Parliament


   From Mr MARTYN BOND


Sir, Dick Tavern's valuable letter on the size and effectiveness of the
European Commission (Letters, April 18) makes one erroneous assertion. He
states that it is 'the only European institution which represents the
interests of the Community as such, rather than those of the nation states'.
To overlook the role of the European Parliament as the voice of the people
of Europe is regrettable, especially at a stage in the negotiation of
political union in the intergovernmental conferences when it will, in all
likelihood, acquire considerable additional responsibilities.
