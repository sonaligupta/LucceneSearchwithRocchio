FT  24 AUG 92 / GMB to push training at TUC


THE right to five days training a year should be included in collective
bargaining negotiations, the TUC will hear next month.
The GMB general union will urge congress to push training up the collective
bargaining agenda by including claims for the right, in line with the
European Social Charter.
The TUC is circulating advice on how to get training on the bargaining
agenda and to negotiate agreements containing targets for training as
measured by National Vocational Qualifications.
