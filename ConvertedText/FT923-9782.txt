Violence and vote-buying marred the first of Nigeria's presidential
primaries for candidates for December's elections, according to state radio
yesterday, Reuter reports from Lagos.
Violence erupted in Borno state in the north, where agents for some of the
20 candidates vying to become the first civilian president in a decade
openly distributed cash, the radio said. In Katsina state, also in the
mainly Moslem north, the independent Sunday Champion newspaper said: 'Agents
of some candidates watched helplessly as the electoral process was being
raped.'
