FT  14 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Sliding bond prices leave Dow
lower


   By FRANK MCGURTY


   NEW YORK


Wall Street
US stocks ended moderately lower yesterday after succumbing to concern over
bond prices and a wave of program-guided selling, writes Frank McGurty in
New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 20.22 lower at 3,661.47, after
battling back from a 50-point plunge in early afternoon. The decline set off
the NYSE's 'uptick' rule, which restricts program trades.
The more broadly based Standard & Poor's 500 was 1.31 easier at 446.26, on
moderate NYSE volume of 278 shares.
In the secondary markets, the American SE composite slipped 1.74 to 437.95,
while slumping technology issues dragged down the Nasdaq composite by 11.84
to 727.38.
After a positive but lacklustre opening, share prices began to slip.
Declines grew more pronounced as an initial rally in bonds, on news of
softer-than-expected retail sales, petered out.
Bond traders were selling into the market's strength soon after the Commerce
Department reported that March retail sales grew by a modest 0.4 per cent,
against expectations of a 1 per cent advance. The release of last month's
consumer price index, which precisely matched forecasts of a 0.3 per cent
rise, had no impact on either market.
Investors were discounting the CPI's significance as an inflation gauge.
Instead they were looking ahead to industrial production and factory
utilisation data, due out Friday. Many were fearing the figures would lead
to a quick boost in short-term interest rates.
Just after 1pm, the sell-off in bonds accelerated, triggering sell programs
and sending share prices reeling. But the market soon stabilised and stocks
moved well off their lows by the closing bell.
Semiconductor stocks remained under heavy pressure. On Tuesday, the
Semiconductor Industry Association reported that the March book-to-bill
ratio, an important indicator of the chip industry's strength, showed no
change last month. Texas Instruments dropped Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 70 3/8
and Micron Technology tumbled Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 83 5/8 .
Among the Dow industrials, Caterpillar lost Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 113 1/2
, Union Carbide Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 24 1/2 . Aluminium producers fell
out of favour, with Alcoa dropping Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 69 1/2 and
Reynolds Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 45.
In the oil sector, Texaco was down Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 63 3/8 . A
federal judge ruled that a lawsuit filed by Ecuadorean Indians against the
company may be heard in the US, if the plaintiffs proved that decisions
which, allegedly, had damaged their environment were made in New York.
Woolworth made a rare move upward after issuing revisions to its 1993
financial results. The stock added Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 17 1/8 .
Canada
Toronto prices closed sharply lower in moderate trading, sparked by declines
in New York. The TSE 300 index fell 46.61 points, or 1.09 per cent, to close
at 4,248.80. Declining issues outnumbered advances 488 to 289. Volume was
63.73m, compared with Tuesday's 53.07m.
