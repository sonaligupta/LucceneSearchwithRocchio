FT  29 JAN 92 / Appointments: MMB and 1992


Christopher Melchers, 55, who for the past three years has been director of
corporate development at Britain's largest hotel group, Forte, has been
lured to the Milk Marketing Board as finance director.
The Milk Marketing Board, the 60-year-old cartel which represents dairy
farmers in England and Wales, is embroiled in a tussle with the Dairy Trade
Federation, the milk processors, over the future shape of the industry,
particularly in the light of the imminent single market.
Asked why Melchers should wish to join an outfit whose very existence was
potentially under threat, George Wright, the new chief executive, says the
organisation's existence has been under threat for the entire 28 years he
himself has been there. He adds that the strong City connections Melchers
has accumulated will be particularly valuable to the board in the midst of
current reform of the dairy industry.
