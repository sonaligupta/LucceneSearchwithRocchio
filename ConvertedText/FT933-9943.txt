FT  06 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Hoskins rebels active again


   By CATHERINE MILTON


REBEL shareholders of Hoskins Brewery, the small real ale brewer, have
requisitioned an extraordinary meeting, at which resolutions will be put to
remove two directors, Mr Barrie Hoar and his brother Robert, and elect a
shareholder, Mr Richard Holman, to the board.
Last year a separate attempt to remove the Hoar brothers, whose family then
held 30 per cent of the shares, collapsed when dissident shareholders, also
critical of management, failed to win sufficient shareholder support.
Mr Holman, the rebel shareholder leader, said he was waiting for the company
to respond to his move.
Mr Holman, who bought into the company at the beginning of this year and
holds a 7.4 per cent stake, said he had circulated the company's
shareholders and found 'considerable support' for management change. He
claimed 40 per cent of shareholders were behind him in April when he was
preparing to call a special meeting.
He said: 'After about eight years the profit and loss account shows a
deficit, Hoskins has never paid a dividend and directors fees and emoluments
totalled Pounds 500,000 in the last five years. Shareholders are not
benefiting from this management.'
No one from Hoskins was available for comment yesterday.
