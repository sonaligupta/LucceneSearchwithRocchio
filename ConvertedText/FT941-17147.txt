FT  06 JAN 94 / Talks on internal row at AEEU


Talks are to be held today among leaders of the AEEU in an effort to resolve
a dispute between the merged engineering and electrical sections of the
union.
The dispute came to a head before Christmas when engineering leaders walked
out of a meeting on the drawing-up of the union's new rule book.
The argument is centred on the different cultures and traditions of the two
unions which merged in 1992. The former engineering union is defending its
strong democratic foundation against the centralist executive-led style of
the old electricians' union.
Finance has proved another source of rancour between the two sections. The
engineers have been anxious to see the sale of Buxted Park, the old
electricians' union's training centre in East Sussex.
Mr Paul Gallagher, head of the electricians' section, said yesterday: 'We
are committed to the arrangement and making it work. So far it's working
remarkably well given the potential difficulties we have had.'
