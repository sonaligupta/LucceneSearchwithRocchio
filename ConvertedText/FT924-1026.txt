FT  21 DEC 92 / Cubans' poll choice limited


   By CANUTE JAMES


Cubans voted yesterday for local government representatives in the first
stage of what the island's government says is a reform of the electoral
process that will lead to direct parliamentary elections in three months,
writes Canute James. All 28,000 candidates for the 14,000 municipal seats at
stake were from the ruling Communist party.
