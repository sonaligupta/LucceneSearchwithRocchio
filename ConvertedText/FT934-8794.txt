FT  13 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Ward Thomas is Yorkshire TV chief


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


THE BOARD of Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television yesterday confirmed that Mr Ward
Thomas is to be group chairman of the ITV company.
Mr Ward Thomas, who helped to found Yorkshire, was appointed acting chairman
on Monday following the resignation of Mr Clive Leach.
Following a board meeting yesterday it was made clear that Mr Thomas will
manage the group, which has announced it will probably incur pre-tax losses
for the year to September 1992-93, with a small committee.
Apart from the chairman the other two members of the committee will be Mr
John Fairley, managing director of Yorkshire Television and Mr John Calvert,
managing director of Tyne Tees.
It is possible that the executive committee could continue to run the group
for some time and it is not certain that a separate chief executive will be
appointed.
