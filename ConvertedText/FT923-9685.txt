FT  04 AUG 92 / Lep and banks agree debt swap


   By JANE FULLER


LEP GROUP, the freight forwarding and security concern brought to the brink
of bankruptcy by borrowings of more than Pounds 500m, has reached agreement
with about 25 banks to swap Pounds 180m of debt into equity.
The rescue is likely to leave the banks, led by National Westminster, with
85 per cent of the company, which before yesterday's announcement had a
market value of less than Pounds 8m. Lep's share price had fallen from 199p
in June 1990 to less than 5p earlier this summer.
About 784m new shares will be issued, nearly six times the current number.
As the price is 21p each, compared with yesterday's opening of 5.5p,
existing shareholders - of which the largest is the security group ADT, with
27 per cent - are unlikely to take up the 17-for-3 open offer.
The directors, now headed by company doctor Mr David James, yesterday warned
shareholders that Lep would not be able to continue trading unless they
approved the rescue proposals. Mr James replaced Mr John Read, the former
chairman and chief executive, who is suing for Pounds 1.7m compensation. Lep
has issued a counter - claim.
Apart from the debt-equity swap, which will reduce net borrowings from
Pounds 507.8m to less than Pounds 330m, Lep will also be allowed to roll up
interest payments on Pounds 145.7m of its remaining debt for three years.
This leaves Pounds 182m of borrowings outside the restructuring, which will
have to be serviced.
The group also announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 59.1m in 1991 after Pounds
47.3m of exceptional costs and net interest payments of Pounds 38.3m.
Extraordinary costs amounted to Pounds 172.1m, of which the largest item was
the write-off of Lep's entire Pounds 92.4m investment in US property. The
losses attributable to shareholders totalled Pounds 235.1m and there is no
dividend payment.
The accounts have been qualified by Touche Ross, the auditors, who point out
that the company may be unable to continue trading if shareholders reject
the restructuring, or if banks outside the agreement refuse to finance
ongoing debts.
The rescue will enable a Pounds 900,000 deficit on the pension fund - caused
by a fall in value of a property purchased from a group subsidiary - to be
repaid over the next two or three years.
