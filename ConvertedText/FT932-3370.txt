FT  15 JUN 93 / BIS Annual Report: Japanese banks 'short on details'  - A
look at the annual report of the Bank for International Settlements


   By PETER MARSH


UNCOVERING details about loan problems in Japan is made more difficult by
limited statistics provided by Japanese banks on borrowers which run into
difficulties, the BIS report says.
In a section on financial distress in the banking system, it says loan
losses in companies or banks 'can have serious implications' for economies,
even though these are often difficult to assess.
The report says an important question is the extent to which information
known to banking authorities about banks' balance-sheets is publicly
disclosed - an area where standards differ markedly between different
countries.
The BIS says: 'The limited statistics on non-performing loans make it
particularly difficult to assess asset quality in the case of Japanese
banks.'
The BIS emphasises that in the case of 21 big Japanese banks the information
of this kind covers only loans of a specific period. Loans granted which
fail to meet the criteria for reporting suggest that in Japan 'the actual
scale of problem loans is likely to be larger' than would appear from an
examination of publicly available documents.
The report says banking authorities should identify problem loans early and
take quick action to tackle them.
