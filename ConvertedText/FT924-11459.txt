FT  26 OCT 92 / Letter: Energy policy - needs of electricity customers and
coal priorities


   From Mr J C L COX


Sir, We welcome the government's decision to undertake a wide ranging review
of energy policy, with specific reference to the fuels used for electricity
generation, and to publish the results in a white paper.
It is essential that the review takes full account of the interests of
electricity customers and not just the interests of the supply industries.
The needs of large industrial customers carried little weight in the
decisions that were made on the restructuring and privatisation of the
electricity industry, and price increases they have since suffered are
making it difficult for them to justify reinvestment in Britain.
Electricity prices to large users in this association have increased on
average by a third over the past two years, with much higher increases in
specific cases. The 'pool' price, which sets the level for industrial
contracts, increased by 20 per cent last year, and is expected to rise again
by 20 per cent this year, against a background of static or falling basic
fuel prices.
The prospect for next year, when the new coal deal comes into effect, is a
further substantial increase and this expectation is based on estimates by
the electricity supply industry.
This is an aspect of energy policy that must be taken into account in the
review that has been promised by the government.
