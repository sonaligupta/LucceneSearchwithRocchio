FT  22 DEC 92 / International Company News: PWA plans to issue new stock

PWA, parent of struggling Canadian Airlines, has sent a draft restructuring
plan to its senior creditors proposing to settle CDollars 506m (USDollars
397m) of claims by issuing new common stock.
However, airline analysts are sceptical about the proposal, saying
acceptance is unlikely unless American Airlines, which has offered to invest
CDollars 246m for a 25 per cent interest in PWA, is fully committed and
other aspects of the restructuring plan are in place.
PWA, under the weight of the airline's operating losses and heavy financial
charges, took the first step in its restructuring last month.
It suspended all the non-operational payments, such as money owed to its
lenders and equipment lessors, to conserve cash. The airline continues
normally but capacity has been cut 15 per cent.
Last Friday Alberta and British Columbia together provided a CDollars 70m
loan guarantee on top of a Federal government guarantee of CDollars 50m. But
these can support PWA's cash needs only through mid-January, analysts say.
The equity swap is the centrepiece of a full corporate restructuring
promised by PWA late in February.
Mr Rhys Eyton, chairman, said that together with concessions offered by the
15,000 employees worth CDollars 200m over four years, PWA will be ready to
complete the link-up with American Airlines. However, PWA has not explained
how it would deal with American's condition that it switch computer
reservations systems.
