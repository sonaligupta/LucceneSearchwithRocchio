FT  13 NOV 93 / Motoring: The new Seat Ibiza


   By STUART MARSHALL


THIS IS the new Seat Ibiza, smaller than an Escort or Astra but larger than
a Corsa or Peugeot 106 and exceptionally keen value with three or five
doors. Prices range from Pounds 6,895 for a 1.3-litre three-door to Pounds
11,250 for a two-litre GTi which, remarkably, has an insurance group rating
of only 10.
For several years, Seat has been part of Volkswagen. The Ibiza is the first
entirely new VW Group car to be conceived and built outside Germany. It has
the solid construction typical of VW products and seats four adults
comfortably with plenty of luggage space. The long wheelbase ensures that it
rides well.
The two I have just sampled were the cheapest 1.3-litre CL and a 1.9-litre
diesel (Pounds 7,595), also a three-door.
I found the driving position excellent, the five-speed gear-shift delicately
precise, and both handling and road-holding well up to class average.
Overall gearing was fairly low, making for lively acceleration, good
hill-climbing and flexibility in town.
I thought the CL would appeal to young buyers who would have liked, but
could not afford, a VW Golf as their first new car. The quiet and vigorous
diesel, with power steering as standard, kept up with the motorway pack and
seemed prepared to go almost anywhere in top gear.
Long-distance commuters who do not have company cars, and anyone who has to
count motoring costs carefully, would find the Ibiza diesel worth looking
at.
