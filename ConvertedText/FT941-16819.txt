FT  07 JAN 94 / International Company News: Superfos agrees to sale of grain
division


   By HILARY BARNES

Superfos, one of Denmark's largest conglomerates, signed a letter of intent
yesterday to sell its grain and fodder division, which will halve group
turnover.
The decision to sell was accompanied by the resignation of Mr Bent le Fevre,
the managing director.
The buyer is Dansk Landbrugs Grovvareselskab (DLG), the agricultural
co-operative group, which will pay DKr500m (Dollars 74.6m) and redeem
DKr400m credits owed by the grain and fodder division to the Superfos parent
company.
Turnover in Superfos's grain and fodder division in 1992 was Dkr3.7bn to
DLG's DKr6.4bn, with market shares of 13 per cent and 23 per cent
respectively.
Superfos's grain and fodder division lost DKr64m in the first half of 1993,
when there was a group loss of DKr23m.
In the 1980s Superfos was forced to sell its fertilisers businesses, another
traditional sector, after the company lost heavily as a result of expanding
into that market in the US.
Superfos's main remaining businesses will be road surfacing (in which it has
a group of companies operating in the US) and the manufacture of plastic
containers.
