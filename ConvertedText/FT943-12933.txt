FT  22 JUL 94 / Granada Group to cut jobs


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


The Granada Group yesterday moved to integrate the non-programme making
activities of Granada Television and London Weekend Television with the loss
of between 150 and 200 jobs from a combined staff of 2,000.
The integration plan, drawn up following Granada's hostile takeover of LWT,
was announced yesterday by Mr Charles Allen, chief executive of both ITV
companies.
Joint operations to provide finance, transmission, press and publicity
services across the companies will be created. There will also be a single
broadcasting unit to implement broadcasting strategy across the companies.
The companies will maintain their own programme production and technical
services 'in recognition of the uniquely successful programme-making culture
at each company'.
A new sales organisation, Laser, will sell the airtime of Granada, LWT,
Yorkshire, Tyne Tees and Border.
Mr Steve Morrison, managing director of Granada Television, becomes managing
director of LWT and Mr Mike Southgate, managing director of LWT's facilities
operation, The London Studios, becomes deputy managing director of LWT.
Ms Andrea Wonfor, director of programmes at Granada, and Mr Jules Burns,
director of programmes and management services there, become joint managing
directors of the company.
Mr Robin Paxton, LWT's managing director of broadcasting, is to leave the
company.
Mr Allen said the company had put the programme making businesses at the
heart of plans for growth. 'These changes will strengthen our competitive
position,' he said.
