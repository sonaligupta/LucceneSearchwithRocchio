FT  12 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Maple Leaf expands milling

MAPLE LEAF Foods, the Canadian food processing arm of Hillsdown Holdings,
plans two joint ventures with ConAgra, of the US, to position its Canadian
flour-milling business for the whole North American market.
Maple Leaf contributes its flour-milling and bakery mix assets to a Canadian
joint venture owned 50-50 with ConAgra, which contributes its flour-milling
operation in Buffalo, NY, to a US joint venture.
The move stems from Canada-US free trade and aligns the flour-milling
operations with a leading US miller, Maple Leaf said. 'This puts our
flour-milling business in a strong strategic position for the future.'
The company earlier tried to merge its flour-milling business with the
Ogilvie Mills division of John Labatt but was precented by Canadian
competition rules.
Maple Leaf, Canada's largest food processor with operations in the US and
Europe, reportednet profits of CDollars 67.2m, or 97 cents a share, for 1991
up 54 per cent from CDollars 41.1m, or 63 cents a share in 1990, on sales of
CDollars 3bn (CDollars 3.5bn).
The sales decline was due to disposals and closures, including the dairy and
beef operations in 1991. The edible oils business is being sold. Analysts
estimate it is worth about CDollars 100m.
In 1991, consumer foods improved margins. Lower flour-milling profits offset
gains by the bakery, retail franchise and international businesses.
Agribusiness was stable. Except for poultry, individual businesses did
better.
Maple Leaf, formerly Canada Packers, closed the year with net cash of
CDollars 151m after a CDollars 226m equity issue last November. About 54 per
cent-owned by Hillsdown, it aims at becoming a North American food group and
a US takeover is widely expected.
