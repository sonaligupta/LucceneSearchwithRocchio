FT  16 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Why Wales resists change


   From JOSEPHINE FARRINGTON


Sir, I read with interest Philip Stephens' article, 'PM urged to shelve
radical plans' (March 14), on growing pressure for the government to delay
implementing local government reorganisation in England until after the next
general election. I hope the same 'consolidators' to whom he refers will
also press the prime minister to drop the unpopular proposals for changing
Welsh local government.
Only one in five in the principality supports the government's plans to
establish 21 so-called unitary authorities at a cost of Pounds 201m. If the
people of Wales, members of the Confederation of British Industry, Trades
Union Congress, voluntary organisations and the overwhelming majority of
Welsh MPs oppose this proposal, how can English MPs justify forcing it on
them? They could not have sent a clearer message to Whitehall. For a
government that claims to want to listen to the people, it is certainly keen
to ignore the wishes of the Welsh. They have not been given an independent
commission to examine council structure.
We can only hope the same ministers now making such pragmatic noises about
reforming English local government will speak up for Wales.
