FT  15 JUN 93 / UN human rights row: Dalai Lama refused entry to Vienna
conference


   By PATRICK BLUM IN VIENNA


THE UNITED Nations World Conference on Human Rights, the first in 25 years,
opened in Vienna yesterday amid controversy and strong criticisms from
independent human rights organisations which denounced the organisers'
decision not to allow the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader and
campaigner for human rights, to attend the opening ceremony.
The Dalai Lama unwittingly became the symbol of what many non-governmental
organisations (NGOs) regard as the double standards set by the UN and member
states when it comes to human rights issues.
The Dalai Lama, a Nobel Peace prizewinner, was barred from attending the
ceremony following objections to his presence from China. The decision
brought an outcry and caused a boycott of the opening ceremony by 14 Nobel
Peace prize laureates.
Mr Pierre Sane, secretary general of Amnesty International, said: 'Is this
the message the UN World Conference wants to send to the world this morning?
Is this what is meant by a commitment to human rights - that a man of peace
like thr Dalai Lama is forbidden entry? We are appalled by this decision.'
The row symbolised the enduring and at times bitter debate between advocates
of the 'universality' of human rights - represented primarily by the
developed countries of the north - and many developing countries which
prefer to stress economic development and cultural differences, and who see
the strictures of the north as badly disguised interference and imperialism.
More than 100 countries are represented in Vienna.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, in his opening speech
tried to steer a middle road but he could not avoid the debate over
'interference'.
He suggested the international community had a duty to act against states
that flouted human rights and abused their people.
