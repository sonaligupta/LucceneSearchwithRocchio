FT  23 OCT 92 / International Company News: DAF defers preference dividend


   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent


DAF, the Dutch commercial vehicle maker in which British Aerospace has a 16
per cent stake, is deferring payment of a dividend in 1992 on its
convertible cumulative preference shares.
The move, announced yesterday, caused a sharp drop in the heavily
loss-making group's share price which hit an all-time low, with the ordinary
shares falling 14.8 per cent to Fl 11.5 from Fl 13.5, while the preference
share price dropped 13 per cent to Fl 12.
DAF said yesterday that the management board believed that it was 'not in
the interests of the company to make a dividend payment at present in view
of today's circumstances'. The dividend was due to be paid on November 1.
The company raised Fl 250m (Dollars 132m) through an issue of convertible
preference shares in September last year to bolster its battered balance
sheet.
The preference shares are supposed to pay a cumulative dividend of 10.5 per
cent per year and must be converted into DAF ordinary shares in four
instalments from June 1, 1995 to June 1, 1998.
DAF is in its third year of heavy losses in the face of the steep recession
in the commercial vehicle industry in the UK, its most important market.
It cut its net loss significantly in the first half of the year, however, to
Fl 97.4m from Fl 179.1m in the corresponding period a year ago.
DAF is still holding talks on forming a 'strategic alliance' with
Mercedes-Benz, the world's leading truck maker, including the possibility of
the German group taking an equity stake, while at the same time it is
seeking additional loan funding of Fl 210m in credits backed by the Dutch
and Belgian governments.
