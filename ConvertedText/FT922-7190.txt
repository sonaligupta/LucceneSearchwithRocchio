FT  20 MAY 92 / Crime squad officers will not be prosecuted


   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent


NO OFFICER from the West Midlands Police Serious Crime Squad, disbanded in
disgrace nearly three years ago, will be prosecuted, Mrs Barbara Mills, the
director of public prosecutions, decided yesterday.
The move led to expressions of disquiet about its implications for the
criminal justice system.
The Crown Prosecution Service's decision to close its files on the Serious
Crime Squad follows consideration of a report by the West Yorkshire Police
for the Police Complaints Authority.
The West Yorkshire Police spent two years delving into the activities of the
Serious Crime Squad between January 1986 and August 1989, examining
complaints from 97 people, more than a third of them Afro-Caribbean. Its
investigation is the most widespread of any made by one police force into
the activity of another.
