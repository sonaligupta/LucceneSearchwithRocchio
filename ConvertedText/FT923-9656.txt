FT  04 AUG 92 / International Company News: Colder weather helps Skis
Rossignol recovery

SKIS Rossignol, the French company which is the world's largest ski
equipment manufacturer, continued its recovery with a 27 per cent increase
in turnover to FFr319.6m (Dollars 63.92m) in the first quarter of this
financial year.
The increase in sales for the three months to June 30 was fuelled by the
group's success in the Winter Olympics, where 18 medal winners used its
skis. Skis also benefited from the cold weather in Europe's skiing resorts,
which produced a marked improvement in demand for ski equipment after
several successive seasons of warm winters and snow shortages.
The spate of warm winters, combined with the effects of the economic
recession, has pushed Skis Rossignol, which also makes tennis and golf
equipment, into the red. The group recently announced an unexpectedly high
loss of FFr53.9m for the year to March 31, against a higher loss of
FFr140.8m the previous year.
Mr Laurent Boix-Vives, chairman, has forecast a return to profitability this
year, helped by cost-cutting and productivity improvements.
