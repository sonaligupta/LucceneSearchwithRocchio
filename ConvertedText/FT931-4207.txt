FT  12 MAR 93 / Rolls-Royce to cut 5,000 jobs after pre-tax loss of Pounds
184m


   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent


ROLLS-ROYCE, the aero-engine and industrial power group, is to shed 5,000
jobs over the next two years and cut its dividend after incurring a Pounds
184m pre-tax loss in 1992.
The latest restructuring, announced yesterday, was attacked by Rolls-Royce's
unions and the Labour party as a 'bitter blow' for British industry.
The company, which has cut 12,000 jobs in the past two years, said it had
been forced to restructure because of the decline in military business and
the turmoil in the world airline industry.
Sir Ralph Robins, chairman, said 3,000 jobs would be lost this year and
2,000 in 1994. All the job cuts will involve aerospace activities with about
half affecting the military engine business and the rest the civil side.
The latest cuts will mean a 10 per cent fall in the Rolls-Royce workforce
from 51,800 employees at the end of last year to 46,800 by the end of 1994.
In 1990, the company employed 64,200 people.
Mr Terry Harrison, chief executive, said Rolls-Royce was continuing to
consolidate its manufacturing activities around a few larger plants by
shutting four smaller facilities, including the helicopter engine plant at
Leavesden, Hertfordshire, a components plant at Parkside, Coventry, a metal
fabrication plant at Mountsorrel, Leicestershire, and a facility at Rodney,
near Bristol.
The biggest cuts will affect the Derby civil aircraft operations, which will
lose 1,545 jobs, and the Bristol military engine activities, which will shed
1,400 jobs.
Rolls-Royce made a Pounds 180m provision in its 1992 accounts to cover the
latest job cuts and plant rationalisation programme and a further Pounds 50m
provision to cover bad debts. There was an additional Pounds 38m provision
to cover restructuring during 1992.
Excluding these exceptional items totalling Pounds 268m (Pounds 58m in
1991), Rolls-Royce reported a profit of Pounds 84m compared with Pounds
109m. After exceptional items, the pre-tax loss of Pounds 184m compared with
a Pounds 51m pre-tax profit the previous year.
Sir Ralph said that Rolls-Royce had maintained a strong balance sheet with
positive cash flow and no debt and that the order book had increased by
Pounds 100m to Pounds 6.7bn in a particularly difficult year for both
aerospace and industrial power operations. Turnover was flat at Pounds
3.56bn.
A loss per share of 20.91p compares with earnings per share of 2.49p in
1991. The final dividend of 2.45p (4.7p) reduces the total to 5p (7.25p).
The share price ended 2 1/2 p up at 131 1/2 p.
