FT  25 MAY 93 / International Company News in Brief: Dupont


   By JEREMY BENNALLACK-HART


DUPONT, the US chemicals group, is to combine its nylon operations into a
single business called DuPont Nylons, writes Jeremy Bennallack-Hart.
Mr Jerry Blumberg, DuPont senior vice-president, who will run the operation,
said: 'Our nylon business is not reaching its full potential because our
internally-focused structure is so cumbersome. The goal is to unify and
simplify our nylon supply chain to achieve improved customer service at
lower cost.'
