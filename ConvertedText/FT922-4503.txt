FT  05 JUN 92 / Observer: Old pals


What does John Butterfill, who has just missed becoming chairman of the Tory
European European Affairs committee, have in common with new Treasury
minister Anthony Nelson and Jonathan Aitken, now a junior minister at
defence?
It seems the 51-year-old Butterfill, too, was a protege of erstwhile tycoon
Jim Slater, whose Slater Walker empire collapsed in the 1970s. A chartered
surveyor, Butterfill used to be managing director of St Paul's Securities,
one of Slater Walker's many property vehicles.
Although former Welsh secretary Peter Walker and Sir Peter Morrison, Mrs
Thatcher's parliamentary private secretary, are no longer MPs, 63-year-old
Slater still must have more old pals in Parliament than many businessmen of
his generation. A bottle of malt for the most comprehensive list of MPs who
got their business training in the Slater Walker empire.
