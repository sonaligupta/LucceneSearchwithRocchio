FT  15 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Hard to catch a Eurostar


   From Dr CAROLINE JACKSON, MEP


Sir, Your Business Travel section reported ('In time for Eurostar', December
12) that a passenger arriving less than 20 minutes before the departure of
the Eurostar train from Waterloo was barred access on the grounds that
security checks could not be carried out.
The arrangements surrounding the existing Eurostar service are so bizarre
and haphazard that I begin to wonder whether it is not being run by a group
of fifth columnists in the pay of the ferry companies. I arrived 10 minutes
before the Waterloo-Brussels departure the other day and was waved through
with no security checks on my baggage whatever. When I had phoned Eurostar
the previous day - with great difficulty because the line was constantly
engaged - I was told that the train was very full. In fact, it was virtually
empty, both ways.
Meanwhile, at the Gare du Midi in Brussels, the Belgians still insist on
static passport checks and their station is like an unfinished morgue.
Getting a ticket at all in the UK requires reserves of perseverance. Not
everybody, especially business travellers, can plan weeks or even days in
advance. I tried for a ticket for the next day's Eurostar at Swindon and
Didcot, both important London feeder stations, and was told that they could
not sell me one because they did not have the necessary computer equipment.
At Didcot they believe that it will be two years before they get it. I was
advised to try Reading, Bath or Bristol.
I have just rung Eurostar again - to get a recorded announcement that the
office is closed because of a fire drill. No alternative arrangement for
booking tickets seems to be in place.
Do they want passengers at all?
