FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Exceptionals propel Alvis ahead to Pounds
5.83m


   By GEOFF DYER


Exceptional profits of Pounds 2.52m helped Alvis, the defence contractor,
lift pre-tax profits by 15 per cent in the year to September 30.
The upturn from Pounds 5.07m to Pounds 5.83m was achieved despite an 18 per
cent fall in turnover to Pounds 80m (Pounds 97.3m), resulting from weak
order books in several subsidiaries.
The sale of Alvis's 11.2 per cent stake in Avimo Singapore, coupled with the
disposal of Alvis UAV Engines, resulted in exceptional gains of Pounds
4.23m. However, the group also took a charge of Pounds 1.7m for redundancy
and restructuring costs.
Operating profit from continuing operations dropped from Pounds 5m to Pounds
43,000 on sales 31 per cent lower at Pounds 67.1m.
Profits at Alvis Industries fell from Pounds 1.89m to Pounds 1.28m, after
losses at Alvis Vehicles and Alvis Aerospace and Transmissions.
Mr Nick Prest, chief executive, said: 'We are reasonably confident that
Alvis Vehicles will get some substantial orders this year, which is very
important for the profitability of the group.'
Unipower, the manufacturer of specialist military vehicles acquired in
February, did not make a substantial contribution to profitability, but is
expected to next year. The goodwill write-off from the acquisition is Pounds
3m higher than was then expected at Pounds 9.42m.
Avimo Singapore's contribution to profits fell from Pounds 6.57m to Pounds
3.26m because of poor results at its Asian operations. Avimo Alvis
Aerospace, which makes castings and mechanical components, incurred a
substantial loss.
Helio, the maker of periscopes and equipment for fighting vehicles, and Arab
International Optronics both performed well.
Earnings per share emerged at 2.5p (2.4p) and an unchanged final dividend of
0.5p is proposed maintaining the total for the year at 1p.
The shares closed down 1p at 41p.
