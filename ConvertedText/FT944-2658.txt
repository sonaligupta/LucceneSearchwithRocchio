FT  16 DEC 94 / Cancer drug test results raise hopes on treatment


   By DANIEL GREEN


A maverick drugs industry entrepreneur may be about to prove his detractors
wrong with a cancer drug that appears to be as good as existing treatments,
but without severe side-effects.
The drug will be submitted for regulatory approval in the first quarter of
1995 and could be on sale in Europe by 1996.
Dr David Horrobin's company, Scotia Pharmaceuticals, yesterday published
final-stage clinical trial results on EF13, a pancreatic cancer drug, which
show that the life expectancy of cancer sufferers increased by up to
two-thirds compared with patients on chemotherapy.
Shares in Scotia Pharmaceuticals rose 21p to 274p after the company
presented its results to City analysts. With the price rise, Scotia has
become the UK's second biggest biotechnology company by market
capitalisation.
Cancer experts gave the results a cautious welcome. Professor Gordon McVie,
scientific director at the Cancer Research Campaign, a London-based charity,
said the results were encouraging. But he pointed out that the trials, which
compared EF13 with historic data on mortality, would have been more
convincing if the drug had been compared with a placebo in which neither
doctor nor patient knew what was being administered.
Scotia said the promising preliminary trial data meant there were ethical
problems in knowingly withholding the drug from sufferers.
Professor Karol Sikora, cancer consultant at Hammersmith Hospital, London,
said the results were 'interesting' but that 'much more evaluation' was
needed.
Cancer of the pancreas is one of the deadliest forms of the disease, with
about 60,000 deaths a year in Europe and North America. The historic data
suggest that, with the normal treatment regime in the UK, average life
expectancy is just over three months. With the intensive chemotherapy
sometimes used in the US, the figure is seven months. With high doses of
EF13 patients survived for a year on average.
As the trial was not placebo-controlled it is possible that patients on EF13
survived longer because they had been selected for being stronger or because
doctors gave them extra attention.
Success for the drug would vindicate Dr Horrobin's championing of an obscure
corner of chemistry dealing with fatty acids. Normally, drug research is
based on protein chemistry.
The former professor of medicine at Montreal University began by selling
evening primrose oil, a natural source of fatty acids, in health food shops
and used the profits to establish research centres and manufacturing plants
in Nova Scotia, Canada, and the western isles of Scotland. He developed
three drugs for treating skin conditions.
