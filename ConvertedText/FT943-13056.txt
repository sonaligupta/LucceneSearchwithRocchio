FT  21 JUL 94 / Effect of tolls on Severn revealed


   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent


High tolls on the Severn Bridge between England and Wales are causing about
1,500 vehicles a day to divert to other routes, a Highways Agency report has
found.
The study was set up to investigate complaints of greatly increased truck
traffic on local routes through Gloucestershire to Wales. The one-way toll
is Pounds 10.10 for a heavy-goods vehicle.
Revenue from the bridge is paying for the construction by Laing-GTM of the
second Severn crossing, due to open in 1996.
The report claims the tolls are 'not a significant factor' in increasing
traffic on other routes, but that factors such as congestion play a bigger
part. It says the problem should be eased when the second bridge opens.
The report showed that about 2,700 more vehicles a day than might be
expected were travelling west through Gloucestershire after allowing for
traffic growth, said Mr Robert Key as minister for roads and traffic. He
said: 'Only 1,500 of these can be positively identified as avoiding bridge
tolls.'
He argued that the extra traffic was fairly evenly spread over the M50
motorway and other main diversion routes.
The Road Haulage Association, which has called for bigger discounts for
regular users of the bridge, rejected the view that the tolls were not a
significant factor.
