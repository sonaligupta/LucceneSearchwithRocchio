FT  24 NOV 92 / Canadian loan rates rise likely


   By BERNARD SIMON


   TORONTO


CANADA'S markets are braced for another steep rise in interest rates today
as the central bank seeks to brake the sliding Canadian dollar, writes
Bernard Simon in Toronto.
The Bank of Canada is expected to raise its weekly discount rate to almost 9
per cent, compared to its present 7.95 per cent and a low of 4.93 per cent
in early September.
The jump in rates, which included two increases in banks' prime lending rate
last week, has failed to reverse the currency's slide. The dollar fell below
77.80 US cents yesterday morning, against almost 84 cents at the end of
August.
A senior Bank of Montreal official yesterday predicted it would fall
further.
