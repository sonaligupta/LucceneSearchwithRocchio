AGA, the Swedish industrial gas group, yesterday reported unchanged profits
after financial items of SKr1.43bn (Dollars 236m) for 1991 and predicted
that earnings will remain broadly the same in 1992. The dividend is going up
to SKr8.50 from SKr8.
Sales rose by 2.5 per cent to SKr12.7bn.
However, the operating profit after normal depreciation fell by 7 per cent
to SKr1.45bn due mainly to lower earnings in its gas division.
Profits for the gas operations fell by 13 per cent to SKr1.1bn, reflecting
decreased earnings in its Brazilian subsidiary.
Gas sales were unchanged at SKr8.5bn.
Frigoscandia, its food processing and cold storage business, reported a 22
per cent growth in profits to SKr202m due to higher capacity use of cold
store units. Sales increased by 6 per cent to SKr2.8bn.
Aga's Uddeholm energy unit, which was sold last month to the Swedish power
company Gullspang, reported a 18 per cent increase in earnings to SKr118m,
while sales increased by 9 per cent to SKr1.3bn.
Huhtamaki, the Finnish confectionery, packaging and pharmaceuticals group,
reported a 6 per cent increase in profits after financial items to FM251m
(Dollars 55m) for 1991.
The dividend has been increased to FM2.70 from FM2.60.
Sales rose by 2 per cent to FM5.9bn. Huhtamaki said that 1992 would be
another year of slow growth in both sales and earnings.
The confectionery group, which accounted for 55 per cent of total corporate
sales, increased sales by 12 per cent to FM3.2bn. But its operating profits
were virtually unchanged. There was a slight decline in profits for the
packaging sector, although sales rose by 2 per cent to FM1.2bn.
The food units recorded a more steep fall in profits while sales slumped by
21 per cent to FM767m due to the depressed Finnish economy and the virtual
cessation of exports to the former Soviet Union.
The pharmaceutical business was mainly responsible for Huhtamaki's earnings
increase as the division increased operating profits by a third, although
sales fell by 6 per cent to FM644m.
Novo Nordisk, the Danish pharmaceuticals and enzymes producer, increased
pre-tax profits by 28 per cent to DKr1.46bn (Dollars 225m) last year, while
net profits rose by 22 per cent to Dkr928m, a return on equity of 11.2 per
cent.
Sales increased 16 per cent to DKr9.37bn. An unchanged dividend of DKr4 per
share is planned on increased capital.
The only set-back reported in the preliminary statement after a year of
advance on almost all fronts was that the development of a nasal insulin
preparation, for which promising trials were reported last summer, required
'further optimisation' and would be delayed by one to two years.
Substantial new investment would be made in Denmark and abroad in expanding
production capacity in 1992, the company said.
The group made no forecast for 1992, but said that it hoped to achieve a
result compatible with its aim of a long-term annual increase in pre-tax
profits of at least 15 per cent.
