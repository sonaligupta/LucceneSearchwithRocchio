FT  19 MAY 92 / Dr Theo Williamson: innovative engineer: Obituary


DR 'Theo' Williamson, one of Britain's most eminent and innovative
engineers, has died aged 69.
During the 1950s and 1960s he was at the forefront of the development of
automated manufacturing techniques in Britain. In later years he was
critical of the leadership of industrial companies, which he believed had
failed to take advantage of innovations that should have given the country a
commercial lead over its competitors.
In 1971 he wrote a significant paper for the National Economic Development
Office. It was called The Trade Balance in the 1970s: the Role of Mechanical
Engineering; and in it Dr Williamson gave a warning that Britain's trade
balance would continue to worsen if industry failed to give long-term
support to development of high-value-added engineering products.
He was one of the first critics of the short-termism of institutional
investors, which he believed were pursuing short-term financial gains at the
expense of the long-term investment in British industry.
Dr Williamson joined MO Valve in 1943 from Edinburgh University. During his
three years with the company he developed the Williamson amplifier, which
was subsequently used by thousands of hi-fi enthusiasts.
Between 1946 and 1961 he worked for Ferranti, pioneering the development of
numerically controlled machine tools, an area in which Britain then held a
world lead.
He later joined Molins, manufacturer of cigarette-making machinery, where he
developed an automated, centrally controlled manufacturing process. Known as
System 24, this linked tasks previously carried out by separate machines.
Dr Williamson was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1968 for his work
at Molins.
He became a director of Rank Xerox Research in the UK before retiring in
1976.
He leaves a wife and two sons and two daughters.
