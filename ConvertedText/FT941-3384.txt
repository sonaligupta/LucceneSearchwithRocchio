FT  16 MAR 94 / International Company News: Banesto wins JP Morgan support


   By TOM BURNS


   MADRID


The caretaker board of Banesto believes it has won the support of J. P.
Morgan of the US for a major dilution of the troubled Spanish bank's equity
as part a rescue plan.
Backing from J. P. Morgan, which controls Banesto's biggest shareholder,
would remove a doubt hanging over Banesto's AGM, scheduled for March 26,
when shareholders will be asked to accept a 43 per cent write-down in the
par value of Banesto shares. It would also pave the way for the troubled
bank's re-capitalisation by the domestic financial sector.
J. P. Morgan advised Mr Mario Conde, Banesto's former chairman dismissed by
the Bank of Spain in December after inspectors discovered the bank had
grossly over-valued its assets. J. P. Morgan engineered a large rights issue
for Banesto last year and, through the Corsair Fund that it manages, had
invested Dollars 175m of US institutional funds in the Spanish bank.
A spokesman for Banesto said yesterday that although J. P. Morgan had still
not delivered its support to the new board in writing there had been
fruitful and fluid high-level contacts in the past weeks with the US bank.
Relations with J. P. Morgan had been cool following Mr Conde's sacking.
The spokesman said there had been no contact with Mr Robert Mendoza, the J.
P. Morgan vice-president who introduced the Corsair Fund to Banesto and
masterminded the rights issue. He said J. P. Morgan's office in Madrid,
which had a limited role in advising Banesto's former management, had been a
party to the renewed contacts.
It is believed that the Corsair Fund could make a further investment in
Banesto's restructured equity base to remain a significant shareholder in
the bank. Under the proposed write-down and the subsequent
re-capitalisation, the Corsair's current 7.9 per cent holding in Banesto
will be diluted to 4.5 per cent.
