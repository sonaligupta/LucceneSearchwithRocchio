FT  26 OCT 92 / Survey of International Fund Management (7): Gloom returns
after salvage exercise - Japan


   By ROBERT THOMSON


JAPANESE fund managers have spent the past few months in deep thought over
where to put their money. Tokyo stock prices have appeared ready to plumb
new depths, while the general feeling in Japan has been that US stock prices
are on the way down, and currency chaos in Europe has made the region's bond
markets unattractive.
The Japanese government attempted to make the life of portfolio managers a
little easier in August by announcing emergency measures to bolster stock
prices and an investment package to stimulate the economy, but the gloom
soon returned.
As part of the stock market salvage exercise, the government suggested more
pension fund savings money should flow into equities, but there is not much
evidence that the suggestion has been followed. Sumitomo Trust & Banking
suggested that 'we will have to wait a little longer' before these new funds
are committed to the market.
Foreign investors have been net buyers of stocks for much of this year, and
local securities houses say US and European portfolio managers have realised
they were underweight in Japan. And yet it is not clear that the Japanese
economy has bottomed.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) said foreigners were net sellers in late
September and early October, but returned to the market in the middle of
this month. Japanese brokers insist that foreign investors remain interested
in the market, and that the recent selling followed the strengthening of the
yen, which tempted foreigners to take profits.
Currency fluctuations have been foremost in Japanese portfolio managers'
thoughts. Mr Eiji Arima, manager of foreign exchange at Nippon Life
Insurance, has been 'watching the currency situation closely' in the UK, but
was also cautious about the prospects for the UK economy.
Japanese investors have been severely bruised by currency fluctuations in
the past, and funds were repatriated during the currency crisis in Europe.
Mr Shinpei Kawate, investment strategist at Yasuda Trust and Banking, said
that Japanese managers will have to 'exercise great discretion' and not only
in the UK, but in all of Europe.
The souring of sentiment comes after a surge of interest in UK securities
last year, when net purchases totalled Dollars 14.5bn, up from Dollars
1.95bn in 1990. Net purchases of UK securities, mostly bonds, accounted for
19.9 per cent of all Japanese purchases, behind only the US, which accounted
for 21.3 per cent, according to Japan's ministry of finance.
But it is the home market that has most concerned Japanese fund managers.
Daiwa Investment Trust and Management set an unwelcome precedent this year
with its New Stage stock investment trust fund, which was the first fund to
receive finance ministry approval for an extension.
New Stage prospered during the late 1980s, as stock prices rose sharply.
Having reached a high of 38,915.87 in December 1989, the Nikkei market
average has been in decline, leaving the New Stage below par value. As a
result Daiwa was allowed to extend the life of the fund for three years.
The net asset value of equity and bond investment trusts fell 9.8 per cent
last year, with the net assets of stock funds down from Y35,077.2bn at the
end of 1990 to Y28,562.4bn a year later. Net asset value has continued to
decline and, at the end of August, was Y23,219.1bn.
The pressure on equity fund managers was reflected in the rush of
redemptions in 1991, which rose 2.4 times on a year earlier, with
pre-maturity redemptions the vast majority. The value of new stock funds
launched last year was down 43 per cent to Y8,640bn, the lowest level in six
years.
Bond investment trusts have done better, as their net assets rose from
Y10,921.7bn at end 1990 to Y12,911.4 in 1991, and Y18,208.1bn at the end of
August. The names are slightly deceptive, as stocks accounted for 47.9 per
cent of 'stock investment trusts' in August, with the remainder in bonds and
cash accounts.
The weakness of stock prices has clearly been a reason for individual
investors' reluctance to commit their money to investment trusts. But the
close ties between investment trust companies and Japanese brokers may be
another reason, as the securities industries scandals last year gave
investors the impression that brokers unfairly favour their corporate
clients, some of whom had received compensation for investment losses.
The image problems of Japanese fund managers and the need for better
investment yields could provide opportunities for foreign fund managers, who
are gradually gaining access to funds through the liberalisation of the
Japanese financial system. Foreign companies have been given access to
investment trusts and pension funds, but the amount of funds under foreign
management remains small.
Mr Takao Uratani, senior fund manager for National Mutual Funds Management
Japan, the Australian-based group, said the stock scandals prompted
investors to think more about the 'western style' of fund management. His
group has appointed an investment adviser to two recently launched
Asia-Pacific funds, the Yamaichi Asia Fund of Yamaichi Investment Trust
Management and another fund marketed by Sanyo Securities, the second-tier
Japanese broker.
