FT  27 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading


   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE


THE FURORE surrounding British Petroleum helped produce a healthy trade in
stock options and contributed to a lively session in stock index futures
yesterday, writes Christopher Price.
Concerns over BP saw the September FT-SE contract open down at 2,570, which
turned out to be the low point of the day as traders went on a buying spree,
spurred on by sentiment that recent gloomy talk - BP notwithstanding - was
somewhat overdone. By 10am, September had rallied up to 2,593, its high
point.
It then drifted off as trading quietened down towards mid-day, although it
continued to command an average 10-point premium over fair value. Support
was forthcoming from the gilts and bond markets, although short sterling was
reported dull for most of the day.
In the afternoon, September continued to drift, eventually closing at 2,578,
down 25 on the previous session and at a 9-point premium to its estimated
fair value of 35. Turnover was a perky 8,877.
BP dominated traded stock options with 9,982 contracts being dealt. The
October 200 series was particularly busy. Total volume was nearly 35,000,
slightly down from Thursday. The FT-SE 100 traded 10,168 contracts, with BAT
popular at 1,548 contracts and Lasmo at 1,377.
