FT  22 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: The week ahead


MONDAY: Moss Bros, the clothing retail and hire group, is expected to build
on last year's growth, with interim pre-tax profits rising from Pounds
625,000 to between Pounds 1m-Pounds 1.3m.
TUESDAY: McKechnie, the metals and plastics components group, is heading for
1993-94 pre-tax profits of about Pounds 31m, up from Pounds 24.51m last
time. This would produce earnings per share of 23.8p and should mean at
least a maintained dividend of 14.75p.
TUESDAY: Wolseley, the world's biggest distributor of heating and plumbing
products, is expected to report another year of record profits. Forecasts
range between Pounds 185m and more than Pounds 200m for the year to
end-July, against Pounds 121.1m last time. A strong contribution is expected
from Erb Lumber, the US distributor of lumber and associated products bought
for Pounds 51.1m last August, and the first full-year of Enertech, the
Swedish oil and gas burner-maker.
THURSDAY: Followers of the chemicals sector will be scrutinising ICI's
third-quarter results for evidence that prices of commodity chemicals are
recovering rapidly. The company should show a pre-tax profit comfortably
over Pounds 125m, compared with last year's Pounds 73m.
THURSDAY: Country Casuals, the clothing retailer which lost a fifth of its
market value after a profits warning last month, is forecast to report
interim pre-tax losses of about Pounds 1m.
