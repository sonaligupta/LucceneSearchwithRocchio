FT  27 MAR 92 / Lloyd's holds talks to improve image today


   By RICHARD LAPPER


LLOYD'S OF LONDON is to hold the first of a series of 'market leaders'
forums' today in an effort to improve communication between Mr David
Coleridge, chairman of Lloyd's, and the underwriters, agents and brokers who
do business at the insurance market.
Mr Coleridge organised the forums - known widely in Lloyd's as 'help tanks'
 -after recent adverse publicity. He said this month in a letter to more
than 60 executives that a 'frank and open exchange of views' would be
helpful.
Lloyd's said yesterday that the forums, which will take place each month,
will not supplant the work of existing market committees. Initial
discussions are likely to focus on public relations.
'This has to be good,' said Mr Robert Hiscox, a leading agent. 'The twelfth
floor (the floor at the Lloyd's building in London on which Mr Coleridge and
Mr Alan Lord, chief executive, have their offices) tends to get detached
from the realities of the market.'
Mr Paul Archard, chairman of the Lloyd's Underwriting Agents Association,
said the meetings were 'a step in the right direction'.
Lloyd's is expecting to post losses of more than Pounds 1.3bn when it
reports its 1989 results in June, with the losses falling disproportionately
on a minority of outside Names - the individuals whose assets back the
insurance market.
