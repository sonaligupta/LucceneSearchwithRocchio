FT  05 JUN 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Shot in arm for typhoid vaccine


   By PAUL TAYLOR


Typhoid fever is a threat in many countries with inadequate sewage treatment
facilities and poses a risk to the indigenous population and to visitors.
Typhoid vaccines have been available for many years, but while these
vaccines have proved effective they often cause adverse reactions. Patients
also require several doses of the vaccine.
Now Pasteur Merieux, the world's largest vaccine manufacturer, has developed
Typhim VI, the world's first single shot vaccine against typhoid fever.
Unlike earlier vaccines which contain the whole bacterial cell, Typhim VI
uses only the part the bacteria which causes the disease.
The new vaccine is effective for more than 95 per cent of recipients,
provides protection for three years, can be safely given at the same time as
other vaccines and produces far fewer unpleasant side-effects. Merieux:
