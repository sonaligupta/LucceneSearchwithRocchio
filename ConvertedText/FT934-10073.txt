FT  08 NOV 93 / Brittan urges basic competition rules


   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent


SIR LEON BRITTAN, the European Community trade commissioner, this weekend
called on the OECD nations to intensify efforts to establish internationally
agreed minimum competition rules.
The aim should be to develop a legal order in which the whole world could
enjoy the benefits of effective competition law and policy, rendering the
cruder instruments of trade policy otiose.
But, giving the first Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton seminar on European
Law at Oxford University, he warned that this had to remain a very long-term
objective.
The history of the EC showed that to abandon trade instruments totally you
had to have a community - a group of countries coming together sufficiently
closely for them to be capable of being described as having pooled
sovereignty.
Japan and the US would never agree to such a pooling of sovereignty. Even if
agreement could be reached on the competition rules, agreement on a
worldwide independent competition agency to enforce them would be
impossible.
But that did not mean the extension of competition policy into the trade
area was not possible at all, he said.
Sir Leon said as a first step an attempt should be made through Gatt to
agree rules covering cartels distinguishing between acceptable industrial
co-operation and unacceptable restrictive practices.
A similar approach should be adopted to mergers. Rather than attempting to
establish a supranational body to vet mergers, efforts should be
concentrated on developing a core of common rules and a commitment to
enforce them.
