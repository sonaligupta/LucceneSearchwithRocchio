FT  24 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Lloyd Thompson advances to Pounds 6.7m


   By RICHARD LAPPER


HARDENING reinsurance rates and steady growth in new business helped Lloyd
Thompson, the London market insurance broker, to increase its pre-tax
profits by 31 per cent in the six months to December 31 1991.
Pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 6.7m (Pounds 5.1m) and the group declared an
interim dividend of 1.65p, an increase of some 22 per cent.
Fully diluted earnings per share rose by 23 per cent to 5.7p (4.65p).
The share price, which has increased by about 40 per cent in the past 12
months, closed 3p up at 246p.
Brokerage income grew by 27 per cent to Pounds 17.1m (Pounds 13.4m), with
income from marine reinsurance up by 50 per cent to Pounds 5.3m.
Although the wholesale marine account has benefited from increases in rates
for ships and offshore rigs, the benefit was offset by reductions in market
capacity and an increase in the amount of risk retained by some clients.
Revenues were up by 10 per cent to Pounds 7.6m.
Despite continuing soft insurance rates in non-marine classes, the group
expanded revenues by 38 per cent to Pounds 4.2m winning increased business
in both the US and Europe.
Despite declining interest rates, the group benefited from strong cash
balances - as a result of increased business volume - raising investment
income by 19 per cent to Pounds 3.15m (Pounds 2.64m).
Trading expenses increased to Pounds 13.5m (Pounds 10.9m), but the group's
expense ratio - commissions as a percentage of turnover - fell by three
points to 79 per cent.
The group remains heavily dependent on the London market, where it places
about 95 per cent of its business, although Lloyd Thompson's dependence on
the Lloyd's market has declined.
About 45 per cent of its business is placed with Lloyd's syndicates.
