FT  16 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong reaches
another record high


WALL STREET'S record close overnight encouraged the Pacific Rim markets, in
the absence of Tokyo which was closed for a holiday yesterday.
HONG KONG finished at its second successive record high, though well off the
day's best due to profit-taking. The Hang Seng index climbed to 4,420.07
before ending a net 15.05 up at 4,382.66 after turnover of HKDollars 1.76bn,
against HKDollars 1.68bn.
In a buoyant property sector, Cheung Kong rose 20 cents to HKDollars 19.40
and Hongkong Land edged up 10 cents to HKDollars 9.30.
SEOUL fell back as worries over financial constraints, falling customer
deposits and a full-scale labour dispute at Hyundai Motor continued to put
pressure on the market. The composite index dipped 11.49 to 604.63 in
turnover of Won231.1bn, after Won217.2bn.
Hyundai Motor fell by its daily limit of Won1,000 to Won23,800 following
news late on Tuesday that employees of Hyundai Motor had voted to strike.
AUSTRALIA followed Wall Street as the All Ordinaries index moved ahead 23.8
or 1.4 per cent to 1,675.6 in turnover of ADollars 230m, up from ADollars
199m.
Currency considerations supported the natural resources sector, as BHP
jumped 32 cents to ADollars 13.90 and Western Mining gained 20 cents to
ADollars 4.95.
The banking sector was firm in spite of news that the International Banking
Credit Analysis agency had downgraded Westpac's long-term debt rating and
put ANZ's long-term debt on watch. Westpac and ANZ each rose 6 cents to
ADollars 4.36 and ADollars 4.81 respectively.
TAIWAN underwent a technical correction in the wake of its 7.6 per cent rise
since the start of the year. The weighted index lost 8.09 to 4,939.07 in
turnover of TDollars 48.71bn, after TDollars 45.27bn. Dealers said more
profit-taking was likely if the index went through 5,000.
NEW ZEALAND gained ground on better than expected domestic inflation news.
Annual inflation in 1991 fell to a 31-year low of 1.0 per cent. The NZSE-40
index closed 25.38 or 1.7 per cent higher at 1,503.70 in turnover of
NZDollars 29.8m, against NZDollars 31.0m.
Trading was boosted by some block sales, including 5m shares in Brierley
Investments which changed hands at NZDollars 1.06. The stock closed a cent
higher at NZDollars 1.06. Fletcher Challenge firmed 10 cents to NZDollars
3.40, Carter Harvey Holt 8 cents to NZDollars 2.28 and Lion 3 cents to
NZDollars 3.93.
MANILA responded to Wall Street's strength. The composite index advanced
23.84 to 1,260.50 as turnover rose to 132m pesos from 122m.
The telephone blue chip PLDT led the market upwards with a 30-peso gain at
970 pesos, in the wake of its overnight rise in New York. Food and beer
company San Miguel saw its class 'A' shares close a peso higher at 74.50
pesos.
Oil shares continued to fall on profit-taking after their surge on Monday on
news that recoverable reserves at the Linapacan A-2 oil field in
southwestern Philippines could hit 200m barrels.
SINGAPORE strengthened on news that the government-controlled DBS Bank had
lowered its interest rates and by assurances that limits on foreign
ownership of companies would not be lifted. The Straits Times Industrial
index ended 20.71 or 1.4 per cent higher at 1,509.30 in turnover of SDollars
235.47m, up from SDollars 110.3m.
KUALA LUMPUR's composite index climbed 5.65 to 552.28 in volume of MDollars
92m (MDollars 57.9m). Leading the gainers was Genting, which firmed 50 cents
to MDollars 12.10. Resorts World advanced 40 cents to MDollars 10.50 and
Malaysian International Shipping foreign shares appreciated 35 cents to
MDollars 8.00.
BANGKOK finished firmer across the board following gains in foreign stock
markets. The SET index closed 10.89 stronger at 742.99 after turnover of
Bt5.76bn, the heaviest in two months. Siam Cement gained Bt12 to Bt656, Siam
City Cement Bt2 to Bt140 and Jalaprathan Cement Bt12 to Bt680. Bangkok Bank
was unchanged at Bt538.
JAKARTA closed lower, with the official index down 1.27 at 250.14. Trading
was slow and turnover contracted to 2.97m shares, from nearly 4m the day
before. Astra International came under strong selling pressure and fell 300
rupiah to 11,300 rupiah.
BOMBAY soared to a record closing high for the second time this week on
speculative buying fuelled by an amnesty on repatriating foreign funds. The
BSE index added 22.11 or 1.1 per cent at 2,020.18.
