FT  20 APR 94 / Asia to spend Dollars 950bn on infrastructure


   By ALEXANDER NICOLL


Asia will need to spend up to Dollars 950bn (Pounds 646bn) on infrastructure
by the year 2000 to meet the demand created by rapid economic growth and
growing populations, the Asian Development Bank estimates today, writes
Alexander Nicoll.
The bank's annual report says developing member countries - virtually all
Asian countries except Japan and North Korea - put 5 per cent of their gross
domestic product each year into physical infrastructure. This 'will have to
rise by another 2 per cent over the next decade if supply is to keep pace
with demand,' it says.
It estimates the needs of the power and transport sectors at Dollars 300bn
to Dollars 350bn each, telecommunications at Dollars 150bn and water supply
and sanitation at Dollars 80bn to Dollars 100bn.
The ADB says this cannot be financed from traditional sources so it suggests
wider application of user charges, tighter commercial discipline on
utilities, and greater private sector involvement.
