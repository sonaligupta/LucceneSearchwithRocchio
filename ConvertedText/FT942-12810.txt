FT  28 APR 94 / World Trade News: Gatt acts to sweep up old disputes


   By FRANCES WILLIAMS


   GENEVA


Gatt's anti-dumping committee yesterday adopted a controversial disputes
panel report on Norwegian salmon only after the chairman said it did not set
a legal precedent for future disputes.
The move reflects a drive by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to
clear old disputes before the new tougher disputes settlement procedure
under the World Trade Organisation comes into effect next year.
The panel report in question ruled in late-1992 that the US had not complied
with Gatt's anti-dumping code in putting duties of up to 32 per cent on
imports of Norwegian salmon.
However, several signatories of the voluntary code, including paradoxically
Norway itself, were unhappy about some aspects of the report's analysis.
They agreed to adopt the report only after assurances from Mr Jose Graca
Lima of Brazil, chairman of the anti-dumping committee, that it did not
apply to countries not involved in the specific dispute 'nor does it
represent binding legal precedents applicable to other disputes'.
Gatt officials admit that the present disputes procedure has conflicting
objectives in trying to settle trade rows by mutual agreement and developing
Gatt case-law.
The WTO's semi-juridical disputes system will, by contrast, focus almost
exclus-ively on securing conformity with strengthened fair trade rules.
Separately, the members of the anti-dumping committee agreed to set up a
panel, under current procedures, to investigate a complaint by Brazil that
US duties on imports of cotton yarn from Brazil violate Gatt rules.
