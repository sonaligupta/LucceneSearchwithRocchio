FT  23 APR 93 / International Company News: Higher US gas prices offset
lower revenues at Texaco


   By KAREN ZAGOR


HIGHER US prices for crude and natural gas contributed to surprisingly
strong first-quarter earnings from Texaco, the US energy group, in spite of
lower revenues. The company also benefited from improved product margins in
Latin America and cost-cutting.
Excluding charges of Dollars 300m for accounting changes last year,
first-quarter earnings rose 20 per cent to Dollars 278m, or 97 cents a
share, from Dollars 232m, or 80 cents. The company reported a net loss of
Dollars 68m, or 36 cents, in the 1992 quarter, including the charges.
Revenues slipped to Dollars 8.5bn in the first three months of 1993, from
Dollars 8.6bn the previous year.
On Wall Street, shares in Texaco firmed Dollars  3/4 to stand at Dollars 63
5/8 at the close.
Mr Alfred DeCrane, who recently replaced Mr James Kinnear as chief
executive, said: 'Texaco has been able to contain its costs and expenses and
maintain its operational competitiveness through improvements in its
business processes.'
Higher prices for crude oil and natural gas, and lower operating expenses,
helped Texaco's operating earnings from domestic exploration and production
soar to Dollars 133m, from Dollars 86m a year ago.
Earnings from US manufacturing and marketing fell to Dollars 53m, from
Dollars 78m last year, reflecting a glut of supply which depressed refinery
margins on the east coast and Gulf of Mexico coast. In contrast, Texaco's
west coast operations had improved margins.
International exploration and production profits slipped to Dollars 79m in
the 1993 quarter, from Dollars 102m. Last year's earnings benefited from
currency gains of Dollars 29m from lower UK deferred taxes.
Stronger margins in Latin America and the Caltex operating area lifted
Texaco's international manufacturing and marketing earnings to Dollars 123m
from Dollars 81m.
Texaco's petrochemical operations lost Dollars 7m in the 1993 quarter,
compared with earnings of Dollars 8m a year earlier.
