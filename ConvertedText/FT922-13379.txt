FT  11 APR 92 / Kohl's support slips amid migrant fears

SUPPORT for the German government has fallen to its lowest level for three
years, and anxiety over the flood of asylum-seekers has risen sharply,
according to a poll by the ZDF television station this week, writes
Christopher Parkes in Bonn.
Although support for far-right parties, which made strong gains in state
elections last weekend, has increased, they would be unlikely to win seats
in the federal parliament if an election were held tomorrow.
Almost two-thirds of the sample named asylum as the country's most serious
problem. This was the issue which won the Deutsche Volksunion and the
Republicans their backing last weekend. Latest estimates suggest 400,000
refugees will arrive this year.
The ruling Christian Democrats would win 39 per cent of the votes in an
immediate election, compared with 43 per cent last month, the poll found.
The Social Democrats' share would be unchanged at 38 per cent.
The Republicans, who captured 11 per cent of the vote in Baden-Wurttemberg
on Sunday, would win 4 per cent, compared with 2 per cent last month.
Parties need 5 per cent to gain Bundestag seats.
