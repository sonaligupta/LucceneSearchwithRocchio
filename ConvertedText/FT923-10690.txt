FT  29 JUL 92 / Danes to make EC proposals in autumn


   By REUTER


   COPENHAGEN


DENMARK is to offer this autumn its solution to the crisis in the European
Community resulting from its failure to ratify the Maastricht treaty on
European union, Prime Minister Poul Schluter said yesterday, Reuter reports
from Copenhagen.
'We shall work for a new basis for the Maastricht treaty so that Denmark can
sign the European co-operation pact,' he said after a meeting of
parliament's EC committee.
Mr Schluter, a conservative leading a minority two-party coalition, said the
government would publish a white paper on Denmark's future role in the EC
shortly after the French referendum on Maastricht on September 20.
It would serve as the basis for a proposal to the British presidency of the
EC Council of Ministers in October or November, he said. If Denmark reached
an agreement with the EC, it might then be possible to hold a new Danish
referendum.
EC monetary union, defence and European citizenship were controversial
issues in the Danish referendum campaign.
