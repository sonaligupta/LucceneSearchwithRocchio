FT  12 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Poor view


   From Mr MARK PHILLIPS


Sir, Your obituary of Kurt Cobain (Arts, April 11) was offensively
insensitive to the death of a 27-year-old man with a young family. Perhaps
the choice he made was wrong, not as evidence of weak character, but because
of what he had created and could have produced.
