FT  12 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Siemens


The important message from Siemens is contained in the unchanged dividend,
not in yesterday's 8.9 per cent after-tax profits advance. That result may
have been marginally better than the market was expecting, but then there is
always scope to smooth the numbers, and high D-Mark interest rates will have
had a particularly beneficial effect on financial income this time.
In the absence of more specific guidance Siemens' second successive pegged
payout must be interpreted as a pessimistic sign for the future. The
problems at Nixdorf and in semiconductors obviously remain deep-rooted, even
if the haemorrhaging from computers has been staunched to some extent.
Stronger businesses such as telecommunications and medical systems could
conceivably lose some of their shine; the one if Deutsche Telekom turns into
a more cautious buyer, the other if President Clinton carries out his threat
to curb US healthcare costs. Over-riding all this is the German economic
slowdown, and the impact of a revalued D-Mark on competitiveness abroad.
There is little reason to think, however, that in the long run Siemens is
other than a proxy for the German stock market. Over five years it has
performed exactly in line; over 10 years it has underperformed by a mere 2
per cent. Deutsche Bank's downgrading yesterday of corporate earnings for
1992 and 1993 will hardly encourage the many investors who have lately
reduced their German weightings to change their minds.
