FT  25 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Euro Disney falls 4% on
Goldman Sachs report


   By Our Markets Staff


MOST BOURSES recovered after a shaky start to the week, writes Our Markets
Staff.
PARIS recouped some of Monday's losses but failed to break decisively above
1,900. The CAC-40 index touched 1,903.47 before closing 11.69 better at
1,896.26 in turnover of FFr2.2bn.
Euro Disney was the day's most active share, dropping FFr6.40 or 4 per cent
to FFr153.50 with a heavy 1.05m shares traded, on rumours that Goldman Sachs
had issued a negative report.
Goldman Sachs's analyst in New York, Mr Richard Simon, later confirmed that
he was telling clients to sell the stock because it was overvalued and that
earnings growth would be modest. His new EPS forecasts stand at 65 centimes
for 1992, FFr1.75 for 1993, and peaking at FFr3.65 in 1995.
News that the Italian media magnate, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, had decided not
to rescue the troubled television station, La Cinq, hit the market five
minutes before the close. Hachette, which owns 25 per cent of La Cinq,
dropped FFr3.40 or 2 per cent to FFr170.10, while TF1 added FFr8.40 to
FFr393.30 on good volume of 88,441 shares on hopes that it will win
advertising revenue from La Cinq.
FRANKFURT recovered from an early fall, and dealers detected cautious buying
interest from domestic and foreign institutions. The DAX index fell to
1,703.56 in the first half-hour but support around 1,700 helped it to
rebound to close just 4.34 down at 1,713.11. The FAZ index, calculated at
midsession, fell 4.19 to 694.94 in steady turnover of DM5.7bn.
BMW built on recent gains with a rise of DM9.10 to DM571. Reluctance to sell
ahead of the dividend payments at the end of April kept chemicals steady,
with Hoeshst up 70 pfg to DM255.40 and Bayer off 30 pfg at DM295.70.
Financials were neglected on news that M3 money supply grew by 8.5 per cent
in February, well outside the Bundesbank's target and reducing the chance of
an early cut in interest rates. Deutsche Bank fell DM3.50 to DM713.
Hoesch rose DM7 or 2.8 per cent to DM255.50 in speculative buying. News that
Krupp, which has 51 per cent of Hoesch, has been changed into a joint stock
company revived speculation that it would buy in the outstanding shares in
Hoesch.
Asko added another DM15 to DM885 on rumours that its share price was being
lifted ahead of a capital increase, which could take place earlier rather
than later this year.
MILAN disappointed dealers who had expected a firmer market following
Credito Italiano's better-than-expected 1991 results on Monday and
widespread speculation that the Agnelli group would come out of the Perrier
battle unscathed. After a promising start, a lack of buying interest pushed
prices lower, Generali in particular, and open outcry trading finished
earlier than usual. The Comit index fell 5.11 to 505.50 in turnover
estimated at L60-80bn after L71.7bn.
Ifi, the holding company of the Agnelli group, rose L500 or 4 per cent to
L12,870 but Fiat only rose L19 to L4,868. Generali fell L490 or 1.7 per cent
to L28,990 but dealers said there were no reasons for the fall. Pirelli rose
L17 to L1,282 on news that its capital increase was almost fully subscribed.
ZURICH recovered from a disappointing morning session when higher interest
rates depressed sentiment, and the SMI index closed 5.9 higher at 1,824.1.
Nestle bearers advanced SFr40 to SFr9,480 following the successful
conclusion in its fight to win control of Perrier. But its registered shares
slipped SFr60 to SFr9,330.
Strong foreign interest was noted in Brown Boveri and its bearers rose SFr80
to SFr3,870. George Fischer, which reported a 47 per cent fall in 1991 group
profit on Monday, saw its bearers lose SFr27 to SFr993. However, its
certificates gained SFr5 to SFr193 after the company announced plans to swap
them for bearers.
AMSTERDAM saw the office supplies group Ahrend decline by more than 5 per
cent or Fl 7 at Fl 130 after announcing a 40 per cent fall in 1991 net
profit after the close of Monday. The CBS Tendency Index fell 0.1 to 124.9
in turnover of Fl 478m.
Hunter Douglas improved Fl 2.40 or 3.6 per cent to Fl 68.80 after analysts
said that the outlook for the building materials group remains good.
STOCKHOLM featured Volvo, its B shares adding SKr3 to Skr415 on renewed
speculation that it will merge with Renault of France. The Affarsvarlden
General Index closed 0.2 lower at 1,001.4.
