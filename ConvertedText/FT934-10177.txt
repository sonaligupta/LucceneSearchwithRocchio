FT  06 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Housing market recovery still
fragile, says Halifax - At a glance


THE two largest lenders reported different house price movements for
October. Nationwide, the second largest lender recorded a rise of 1.5 per
cent compared with September, resulting in the first annual rise recorded by
the society since its house price index began in 1990. Halifax building
society, which reports figures on a seasonally adjusted basis, found no
change in October. 'House prices have now generally stopped falling, but the
fragility of the recovery in the housing market is clear from the failure of
prices to pick up more strongly,' said Halifax. However, it predicted that
house prices would end the year 2 per cent above their level at the end of
1992.
