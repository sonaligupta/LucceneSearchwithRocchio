FT  28 SEP 94 / Coach station receives award


The redesigned London Victoria Coach Station was last night declared overall
winner of the 1994 Design Effectiveness Awards. The judges said that the
Jenkins Group, which carried out the design, 'turned a dump into one of the
gateways to Europe'. The Pounds 4m project was undertaken for London
Transport between January 1991 and December 1992 while the station remained
open. Projects are judged for the awards on the basis of commercial
effectiveness rather than on aesthetics alone
