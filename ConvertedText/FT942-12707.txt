FT  28 APR 94 / Observer: Toy soldiers


Instead of twisting themselves in knots over the D-day celebrations, the
Brits and the French might as well surrender gracefully and decamp en masse
to Chicago for positively the biggest ever re-enactment of the Normandy
landings.
On June 4 - two days early, but who cares, it's a Saturday and the
organisers are hoping to pull in a crowd of about 200,000 - some 500 US
second world war buffs will storm Montrose beach on Lake Michigan.
Clad in American, British, and Canadian uniforms, their 14 period landing
craft will be backed up by a dozen vintage aircraft, while an allied missile
frigate will fire at the bathing centre doing service as a well-manned
German bunker.
Nearly Dollars 125,000 has been spent at the firework shop for the 'bombs'
for the four-hour re-enactment.
Unfortunately, the organisers failed to advise Chicago city alderman Helen
Shiller of their manoeuvres; when alerted late in the day, she was minded to
block such gallivanting on a crowded family beach, but has apparently been
brought round.
Retired colonel Kenneth Plummer, chairman of the extravaganza, meanwhile,
says it is a serious commemorative act. 'It's not our intention to turn this
into a circus,' he says.
