FT  02 JUL 92 / International Company News: Heavy loss at Sodiaal


   By ALICE RAWSTHORN


THE PROBLEMS of France's dairy industry were highlighted yesterday when
Sodiaal, one of the largest dairies, announced heavy losses for last year
and joined forces with Bongrain, one of its competitors, to rescue Union
Laitiere Normande, an ailing dairy co-operative.
Sodiaal, which owns the Yoplait yoghurt brand, managed to reduce its net
losses from FFr347.2m in 1990 to FFr227.6m (Dollars 44.4m) in 1991 on
turnover which rose from FFr17bn to FFr17.5bn over the same period.
The French dairies have come under pressure because of structural changes in
the agricultural sector and the slowdown in the economy. They have also been
affected by greater competition from other food companies.
Dairies face further pressure due to the concentration of ownership in
French food retailing which has seen a series of mergers culminating in last
month's takeover of the Rallye supermarkets by Casino retail group.
