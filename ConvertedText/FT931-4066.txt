FT  12 MAR 93 / UK Company News: TI suffers 17% fall to Pounds 87.4m - Sales
boosted by six months' contribution from Dowty


   By RICHARD GOURLAY


TI, the specialist engineering company which last year bought Dowty, the
aerospace group, reported a 17 per cent fall to Pounds 87.4m in full-year
pre-tax profits using the new FRS 3 accounting standard.
Stripping out the effect of a Pounds 20m non-cash provision for the loss on
the sale of discontinued operations, profits rose marginally from Pounds
105.2m to Pounds 107.8m. Sales were up 28 per cent at Pounds 1.15bn after
taking in a six months contribution from Dowty.
Sir Christopher Lewinton, chairman and chief executive, said Dowty would
still only marginally dilute earnings in 1993, as projected at the time of
the hostile bid.
Dowty's polymer division had performed better than expected and had broadly
offset the weakness in the aerospace market.
Earnings after the provision for the sale of Thermal Equipment, fell to
15.4p (22.4p). Mr Michael Garner, finance director, said 'normalised' or
headline earnings fell to 18.3p (22.4p). Only 1p of this decline was due to
the Dowty acquisition; the balance was due to the deterioration in the rump
of TI's original businesses.
A final dividend of 7p makes a 10.7p (10.25p) total.
Sir Christopher said TI had two well established world leaders in John Crane
(seals) and Bundy (specialised tubes) and Dowty (aerospace) had the
potential to become a leader.
Balance sheet gearing rose from 15 per cent to 87 per cent for a number of
reasons, including substantial write-offs on Dowty and a one-off charge to
reserves to account for the full cost of post-retirement health care
programmes, mainly in US businesses.
Net borrowings were Pounds 233m, after Pounds 95.4m of exchange translation
on debt held largely in dollars. Interest cover, assuming Dowty's debt was
included for a full year, would be about 10 times.
John Crane continued to perform strongly, with profits of Pounds 47.3m and
organic growth of 13 per cent. Bundy grew 11 per cent organically to Pounds
38.4m. Profits in rump specialist engineering businesses fell 62 per cent to
Pounds 4.1m.
COMMENT
You can quibble about the headline gearing figure - though TI has net assets
unrealistically low after years of goodwill write-offs - and one can
question the absolute level of US debt and the extent of interest rate
arbitrage across the Atlantic, but Crane and Bundy have both shown their
quality by thriving in recession and, given projections for air travel,
aerospace has to be a good long-term business. TI has suffered from worries
over the integration of Dowty. It may continue to suffer for a while, so
that pre-tax profits of Pounds 132.5m, giving 18.6p of normalised earnings
and a prospective multiple of 17, may be a correct level. Longer term, TI
has to be seen as a quality stock.
