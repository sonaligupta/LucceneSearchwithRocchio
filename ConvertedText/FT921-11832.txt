FT  30 JAN 92 / Bonn promises tax and subsidy reform


   By QUENTIN PEEL

PROPOSALS for cuts in corporate taxation and reductions in state subsidies
will be presented by the German government in the coming year, Mr Jurgen
Mollemann, the economics minister, said yesterday.
Action was needed to preserve the competitiveness of the German economy and
stabilise state spending, while also supporting the former east German
economy, he said, in a cautious forecast in the government's annual economic
report.
He called for tax cuts to bring down the marginal rates of income tax and
corporation tax from 53 to 46 per cent, and promised a corporation tax
reform package in the course of the year.
He also promised a package of subsidy cuts, prepared by the economics and
finance ministries, in time for the start of the annual budget negotiations
in June.
He warned that a failure to keep wage awards below the levels of 1991 could
actually result in higher, rather than lower interest rates.
His warning coincided with a gloomy prognosis by Mr Lothar Muller, head of
the Bavarian state central bank and a member of the board of the Bundesbank,
that the German economy would not allow interest rates to be cut by the
central bank at least until the end of the summer.
The government's annual economic report forecasts an overall German growth
rate of just 2 per cent for 1992, with the former West Germany growing by
only 1.5 per cent, and the east by 10 per cent - after its economic collapse
of the past two years.
It suggests that unemployment will rise by 100,000 to 1.8m in the west, a
rate of 6 per cent, compared with a 500,000 rise, to around 1.4m, in the
east, or around 17 per cent.
It is more optimistic on inflation than independent economic forecasts have
been, suggesting 3.5 per cent for the year as a whole in the west, and 12 to
14 per cent in the east. Wage rises it hopes will keep to an average rise of
just 5 per cent in the west, compared with 6.7 per cent in 1991, and trade
union demands of around 10 per cent. In the east, wages are expected to rise
between 30 and 35 per cent.
