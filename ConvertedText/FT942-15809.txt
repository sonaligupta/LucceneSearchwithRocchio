FT  13 APR 94 / International Company News: Japanese papermaker secures help
in debt plan

Japan's Marubeni Corp and two main creditor banks of Daishowa Paper have
sent a group of experts to the debt-laden papermaker to help it in its
five-year restructuring plan, agencies report from Tokyo.
The banks are Industrial Bank of Japan and Fuji Bank. Marubeni owns 5.1 per
cent of Daishowa.
Daishowa, Japan's third-largest papermaker announced last month it aimed to
cut debts to Y270bn (Dollars 2.6bn) by March 1999, from some Y434bn now.
Daishowa Paper, established in 1938 by the Saito family, has been hit hard
after aggressive expansion in the 1980s and the subsequent economic slump.
The Saito family now owns an estimated 30 per cent of the company, and one
family member has said it plans to reduce this to 15 per cent.
'It is inevitable for Daishowa to sell shares owned by the Saito family to
other shareholders to reduce the influence of the family on its management,'
said Mr Morinobu Kobayashi, analyst at Yamaichi Institute of Research.
The company was dealt a heavy blow last November when Mr Ryoei Saito, then
honorary chairman and former president, was arrested on suspicion of bribery
related to land development projects.
In February, Daishowa chose Mr Shogo Nakano as president, making him the
first person outside the family to head the company.
Last month, a delay in plans to sell assets forced Daishowa to downgrade its
business forecast for 1993-94. It now sees a net loss of Y28.2bn against
earlier forecasts of a Y3bn net loss. In 1992-93, it posted a net profit of
Y305m.
