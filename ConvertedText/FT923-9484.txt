FT  05 AUG 92 / Observer: Not so sweet


Stock markets have no sense of romance. Word late on Monday that Swiss
chocolate king Rudolph Sprungli had remarried at 72 sent shares of the
family-controlled firm, Lindt & Sprungli, plunging yesterday.
Sprungli had not been above panicking himself when various accusations had
surfaced about the business ambitions of his bride-to-be 44-year-old
Alexandra Gantenbein, who belongs to an obscure American religious sect
called 'I am'. The marriage was off, Sprungli called in accountants KPMG
Fides to conduct an investigation, the marriage was back on, and the couple
were secretly wed last Friday.
Sadly, the market remains unconvinced that all is now sweetness and light.
By the end of yesterday, the bearer shares of Lindt & Sprungli stood at SwFr
11,000 on the Zurich exchange, down 9.1 per cent on Monday's close, and at
their low for the year.
