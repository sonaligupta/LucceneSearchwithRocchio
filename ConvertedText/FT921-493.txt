FT  28 MAR 92 / World News in Brief: Equities


The three-day rally in London's equity market was effectively knocked on the
head by the latest opinion polls and fears that Labour may emerge with a
clear lead over the Conservatives in a batch of polls published tomorrow. At
its worst, the FT-SE 100 showed a fall of 30.4, but it later eased off the
bottom to close down a net 24.3 at 2,447.9.
