FT  30 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Views of a Tory supporter


What would be the greatest risk of a Tory government?
For it to have an insufficient majority to enable it to take the difficult
decisions necessary to make Britain competitive within Europe and other
world markets.
What would be the greatest risk of a Labour government?
The country will rapidly return towards a managed economy, increased public
expenditure, higher taxes and under-managed (or worse, politically managed)
public services.
Has the election campaign addressed the most important issues facing
business?
The main concerns upon which all others hinge is increased taxation and the
diminished confidence and stifled enterprise which a Labour government would
cause.
What should be a government's priority for industry?
Encouragement for industry to invest for the future, based upon downward
pressure on inflation, movement out of recession and an easing of the
interest burden.
Will Britain be a better place to invest under Labour or the Conservatives?
To return to the policies of the 1970s could lead to a loss of confidence
abroad and a gradual withdrawal of foreign investment.
What would be the effect of Labour's plans to restrict takeovers?
Anything that limits proper competition between groups of managers for the
right to manage the limited corporate assets available is against the
interests of consumers, shareholders, employees and in the long term the
community as a whole.
Should Britain have a minimum wage?
No. A minimum wage would push up costs and lead to demanning and further
unemployment.
Are there any attractive features of Labour's industrial policy?
No. A Labour government would reintroduce the failed policies of the past.
Labour's detailed regulations would be a bureaucratic nightmare.
