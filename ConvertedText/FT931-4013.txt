FT  12 MAR 93 / International Company News: Walk-out protest by retiring
Tisco chief


   By STEFAN WAGSTYL

TATA Iron and Steel (Tisco), India's largest company, yesterday elected a
new chairman at a dramatic boardroom meeting at which the departing
chairman, Mr Russi Mody, walked out.
The new chairman is Mr Ratan Tata, the 53-year-old head of the Tata group,
India's top industrial house, which includes Tisco. The board agreed Mr Tata
should take over when 75-year-old Mr Mody retires later this year on a date
yet to be decided.
Mr Mody, who has served Tata for 54 years, has been fighting against his
compulsory retirement in a bitter battle which has shaken Tisco and
disrupted the Tata group.
The struggle began when Tata Sons, the group's main holding company, passed
resolutions last year requiring managing directors of Tata companies to
retire at 65 and chairmen at 75. Mr Ratan Tata advanced the measure in order
to relieve Tata companies of ageing directors. They had been allowed to stay
primarily because Mr JRD Tata, the group's patriarch and Mr Ratan Tata's
predecessor, had himself stayed on the Tata Sons board despite being 88.
Mr Mody took the retirement rules as a personal attack and struggled to
prevent them being applied to Tata Steel. However, last summer he was forced
to stand down as managing director and move to non-executive chairman.
While other Tata companies fell in with Tata Sons in passing retirement
resolutions, Mr Mody's presence on the board prevented Tata Steel from
following suit. However, after Mr Mody's 75th birthday in January, Mr Ratan
Tata, Tisco's deputy chairman, decided to wait no longer and presented the
retirement resolution at yesterday's meeting. As he spoke, Mr Mody walked
out and the resolution was passed unanimously. Tisco said last night that
the date for Mr Mody's retirement would be fixed by agreement with him.
