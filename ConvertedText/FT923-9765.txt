FT  04 AUG 92 / Islands offer confuses Japan


   By ROBERT THOMSON


   TOKYO


THE Japanese government was confused yesterday by reports that Mr Boris
Yeltsin, the Russian president, has prepared a new proposal to settle a
dispute over the ownership of four islands known in Japan as the Northern
Territories.
Tokyo was surprised by a suggestion from Mr Mikhail Poltoranin, Russia's
deputy prime minister, who arrived yesterday for a five-day visit, that the
US may be involved in an agreement on control of four of the Kurile Islands.
The dispute dominates relations between the two countries, and Japan is
unwilling to offer Russia substantial financial assistance until control of
the islands, occupied by Soviet troops in 1945, is returned.
Mr Poltoranin said the US could be involved in an agreement to ensure the
demilitarisation of the disputed islands, and added that Russia would abide
by a 1956 agreement in which the Soviet Union agreed to hand back two of the
islands.
The suggestion of US involvement bewildered Japanese officials. Japan still
sees the fate of the four islands as a bilateral issue.
