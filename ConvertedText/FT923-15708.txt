FT  01 JUL 92 / People: Sir John Banham moves in as ECI chairman


Venture capital firms are always impressing on the companies in which they
invest the value to be gained from taking on non-executive directors. Few
follow their own advice.
ECI Ventures has taken a leap ahead of the pack with the appointment of Sir
John Banham, until yesterday director general of the Confederation of
British Industry, as non-executive chairman.
He adds the ECI appointment to the five other directorships already under
his belt but since none of these comes with an office he will be moving into
ECI's premises on the north side of Waterloo Bridge.
Sir John, who is 52, has had no previous direct involvement with the venture
capital industry, according to ECI managing director David Wansbrough. But
in his five years at the CBI the organisation did take up the cause of local
venture capital funds which were to be known as Local Investment Companies.
The CBI lobbied, unsuccessfully, for tax breaks to allow the creation of
such companies.
ECI is one of the veterans of the UK venture capital industry and now
comprises 11 partners; it was set up in 1976 as Equity Capital for Industry
to finance small listed companies, particularly those in difficulties, but
since 1980 it has shifted to providing finance for unlisted companies and
now manages four funds with assets of about Pounds 170m.
ECI does not expect to need to raise new funds for a year or so but having
Sir John on its letterhead will do it no harm, with UK investors at least.
Sir John's business skills will be especially welcome in an industry which
has not distinguished itself by its ability to market its services.
