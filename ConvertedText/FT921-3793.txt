FT  12 MAR 92 / Change considered in licensing laws


THE GOVERNMENT is considering changing licensing laws in England and Wales
to allow parents to take children into some premises where alcohol is
served.
Mr Michael Howard, employment secretary, said many foreign tourists found it
difficult to understand why they could not take children into pubs and other
licensed establishments.
