FT  03 SEP 93 / Deal set to be unveiled next week


RENAULT and Volvo, the French and Swedish vehicle groups, are aiming to
announce a full merger of their operations early next week, according to
official sources in France.
The merger would create one of the four biggest car groups in Europe and the
continent's second largest truck group. It would also prepare the combined
group for privatisation as part of the French government's campaign to sell
its stakes in 21 companies. The government currently holds 79 per cent of
Renault's shares.
The most sensitive part of the negotiations between the two companies has
been the question of the division of equity in the combined group and the
sharing of management control.
Industry observers believe that Volvo has accepted a minority stake in a
combined group, but may have the power of veto over sensitive decisions on
investments and assets. Volvo may also have a stronger role in the truck
operations.
One analyst said the division of ownership was the most thorny problem and
it could still delay the merger.
Co-operation between the groups started in 1990 when they announced an
alliance and cross-shareholdings. Progress towards full merger has
accelerated over the past months as a result of the government of Mr Edouard
Balladur seeking to ease its budget deficit and increase the independence of
French companies.
The depressed state of the European car industry has added impetus towards a
merger, which will allow economies of scale and reduced costs.
