FT  19 APR 94 / Scots bank starts direct service


Royal Bank of Scotland yesterday became the latest bank to enter the
telephone banking market as it launched its national Direct Banking service
to run in addition to its branch network.
The launch of the 24-hour service follows three pilot projects which have
been running since last April involving 30,000 customers. The bank aims to
have 300,000 customers using the new service by the end of this year.
The service, available to all personal customers, is free apart from the
cost of the calls, which are charged at local rates.
Midland Bank offers telephone banking through its independent offshoot,
First Direct, which was launched in 1989, while National Westminster also
offers a telephone service in which the customer talks to a person rather
than a computer. Barclays, Lloyds and TSB are among the other banks
developing personal-contact telephone banking projects.
