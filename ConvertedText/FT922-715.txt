FT  26 JUN 92 / Technology: New era looks to mind drugs - In the second
article of a series on drug research, Clive Cookson outlines treatments for
mental conditions from anxiety to memory loss


   By CLIVE COOKSON


The pharmaceutical industry has an abysmal record in treating disorders of
the brain and nervous system. While new drugs have transformed the outlook
for people suffering from infectious illnesses, heart disease, and
gastro-intestinal problems, most psychiatric patients depend on medicines
discovered several decades ago.
Current treatments for mental conditions, from mild anxiety to severe
psychosis, emerged during the 'black box' era of drug discovery. Doctors
observed that they relieved symptoms - often poorly and unpredictably - but
pharmacologists had no idea how they worked. For the most serious problems -
degenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer's - there is still nothing
that really works.
The outlook, however, is much brighter, as scientific discoveries about the
chemistry and biology of the brain find their way into new drugs. The ones
being introduced during the 1990s are based on an understanding of
neurotransmitters (chemical messengers which send signals between cells) and
receptors (protein molecules on the cell which receive the signals and
initiate specific biological responses). After the year 2000, there is the
prospect of far superior treatments based on the genetic processes involved
in mental disorders.
The best known neurotransmitter is 5-HT, also called 5-hyroxytryptamine or
serotonin, which is active not only in the brain but also in other parts of
the body. It is associated with several types of receptor, each giving a
different biological response. The pharmaceutical industry is developing
drugs to interact with each specific type, as an agonist to stimulate the
receptor or as an antagonist to block it. Glaxo of the UK has been
investigating 5-HT systems for almost 20 years and expects a spectacular
payback from two drugs: sumatriptan and ondansetron.
Sumatriptan (trade name Imigran) is the first effective treatment for
migraine, the intense recurrent headache suffered by at least one adult in
12. It was launched last year as an injection and is being introduced in the
UK this month in more convenient form as pills. With sumatriptan ahead of
competition, its potential sales are huge - more than Pounds 1bn a year - if
it can overcome doctors' fear of side effects.
Sumatriptan is an agonist for the 5-HT1 category of receptor, stimulating
the uptake of 5-HT in the cranial blood vessels. That reverses the swelling
which triggers a migraine attack. Glaxo had hoped sumatriptan would have no
effect elsewhere in the body but experience shows that some patients feel
tightness in the chest after injections. That is presumably because blood
vessels elsewhere in the body contain a few of the same 5-HT1 receptors.
Glaxo says sumatriptan's side effects are insignificant for healthy people
but they show how difficult it is to make a selective receptor-based drug.
Ondansetron (Zofran) is an antagonist for a different receptor type, the
5-HT3. It was launched two years ago as an anti-emetic to prevent nausea and
vomiting induced by cancer therapy, but Glaxo is now carrying out clinical
trials with ondansetron for a range of psychiatric conditions including
anxiety, schizophrenia, addiction and age-associated memory impairment.
Glaxo researchers are understandably cautious about proclaiming ondansetron
to be a psychiatric wonder-drug. They blanch when outsiders talk of it as a
potential 'smart drug' which could improve everyone's memory.
Mike Tyers, pharmacology director for Glaxo Group Research, says the 5-HT3
receptors on neurones (nerve cells in the brain) 'seem to be there to
control things when they go wrong.' When everything is working properly,
'they are fairly silent.' If so, a 5-HT3 antagonist such as ondansetron may
help to restore the balance in several disorders, without side-effects.
Another group of new drugs based on the 5-HT system is leading to improved
treatments for depression. The specific serotonin re-uptake inhibitors
(SSRIs), as they are known, increase the low 5-HT levels in the brain which
are associated with many forms of depression.
Eli Lilley of the US is already selling more than Dollars 1bn a year of its
pioneering SSRI, fluoxetine (Prozac) launched in 1988. In hot pursuit is a
second generation of SSRIs led by paroxetine (Seroxat), which was developed
jointly by Novo Nordisk of Denmark and SmithKline Beecham, the
Anglo-American group.
SSRIs have fewer side effects than the 'tricyclic' drugs which have
dominated antidepressant treatment for 30 years. Yet SSRIs still leave much
to be desired: they take at least two weeks to relieve depression and they
fail to work in about one third of patients. That may reflect partly the
poor quality of clinical diagnosis in depression and other non-acute mental
disorders.
Some scientists believe that all forms of depression ultimately work through
a common biochemical pathway. If they are right - and not everyone agrees
with the theory - it may eventually be possible to find a fast-acting drug
that will help anyone who is clinically depressed.
The greatest neurological challenge for pharmaceutical research is to find a
cure for the degenerative brain diseases which lead inexorably to dementia
and death. The most prevalent is Alzheimer's, which affects as many as 20
per cent of people over 70.
The search for an Alzheimer's treatment has led to a new class of drugs, the
nootropics, developed to enhance memory and other cognitive functions. The
first generation of nootropics aims to increase the amount of acetylcholine
in the brain. Alzheimer's patients have a marked deficit of this
neurotransmitter.
Most of the Alzheimer's drugs developed recently work indirectly by
inhibiting an enzyme called cholinesterase which breaks down acetylcholine.
They include piracetam from UCB of Belgium; oxiracetam from SmithKline
Beecham; tacrine from Warner-Lambert of the US; and physostigmine from
Forest Laboratories of the US. Although they have shown promise in clinical
trials, the manufacturers have not yet produced evidence strong enough to
convince the US Food and Administration to licence any of the drugs.
Du Pont Merck, the pharmaceutical joint venture between Du Pont and Merck of
the US, has a promising anti-dementia drug now in late clinical trials which
works in a different way. It acts directly to stimulate the release of
acetylcholine and other neurotransmitters in the brain. The drug (chemical
name linopirdine) is noteworthy too for its unusually vivid and appealing
trade name - Aviva.
However none of these memory enhancing drugs, even Aviva, can do more than
temporarily reverse or slow down the mental degeneration that is
characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. None prevents the build-up of tangled
plaques of amyloid protein, which progressively destroy patients' brains.
The best long-term hope for curing progressive dementias is to identify the
genetic mechanism responsible and then develop drugs to block its effect. In
the case of Alzheimer's, a fault in a gene coding for amyloid precursor
protein (APP) seems to be responsible. In a few families, this is inherited
but it is more often caused by environmental factors.
Many pharmaceutical researchers are now working on long-range projects to
block APP, though they are hampered by the fact that there is not yet a good
animal model for Alzheimer's. Athena Neurosciences of California is one of
the biotechnology companies furthest advanced in this area.
More futuristic still are ideas for repairing brain damage by growing new
nerve cells. That does not normally occur in an adult brain but scientists
are accumulating evidence that selective regeneration could be achieved by
removing some of the genetic factors that inhibit the process.
The series will continue next month by looking at asthma drugs.
