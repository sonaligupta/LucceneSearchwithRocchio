   TAIPEI


Taiwan's Premier Lien Chan, yesterday called for a review of the policy of
prosecuting hijackers on the island rather than repatriating them to China,
Dennis Engbarth reports from Taipei.
Mr Jason Hu, director of the government information office, said Mr Lien had
also ordered 'the transport ministry and other concerned agencies to review
the significance of the latest hijacking incidents, including China's
possible motives.'
Military specialists inspected the aircraft for intelligence-gathering
equipment amid concern that hijackings may be being used by Beijing to
gather military intelligence.
