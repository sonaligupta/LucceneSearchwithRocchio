FT  26 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Feedback tumbles Pounds 0.37m into the red


Feedback, the USM-quoted designer and maker of computer peripheral,
technical education and electronic test equipment, fell Pounds 366,200 into
the red in the year to March 31, against profits of Pounds 57,500
previously.
Directors said that this first-ever loss reflected trading conditions and
was in part due to the low turnover at Feedback Inc and the costs of
integrating source computer systems into Feedback Data.
There had been considerable reorganisation and rationalisation throughout
the group.
On turnover down at Pounds 9.13m (Pounds 9.61m) there was an operating loss
of Pounds 275,100 (Pounds 328,600 profit). Losses per share emerged at 3.37p
(0.17p earnings) and there is no dividend.
