FT  03 SEP 93 / Gamsakhurdia urged to return


   By REUTER


   TBILISI


REBEL leaders in western Georgia yesterday called on ousted president Zviad
Gamsakhurdia to return from exile, saying they would fight to restore him to
power, Reuter reports from Tbilisi.
The 60-strong rebel parliament voted to bring the exiled leader back to his
home region of Mingrelia in western Georgia. Armed supporters, controlling
much of the region, say they are strong enough to put him back in power.
Earlier yesterday Georgian media relayed a government statement which said
Mr Gamsakhurdia had told his supporters, partially surrounding the Black Sea
port of Poti, to blockade the town.
But the exiled leader, living in the Chechen capital Grozny since early 1992
after being ousted from power in Georgia, denied he had ordered the blockade
in preparation for his return, Itar-Tass news agency said.
He told Tass that the railway lines from Poti to Tbilisi had been blockaded
by Mkhedrioni pro-government forces.
Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze flew to Poti yesterday and then to the
towns of Samtredia and Kutaisi.
The government says it is ready to send in troops against the rebels, who
have seized a chunk of western Georgia.
