FT  27 JUN 92 / Property: There's more to Surrey than suburbs - David Hoppit
finds signs of recovery in 'commuter county'


   By DAVID HOPPIT


SPRING WAS a little late this year in Surrey, the southern England county of
the London commuter. The daffodils may have bloomed on time, but the housing
market buds were two months late, delayed not a little by the UK general
election. That, at least, is the impression of Ken Cook, of Hamptons
Messenger May, in Guildford. However, he now believes that the market has
picked up to such an extent that the customary summer lull may not occur.
Surrey is full of surprises. Striding or riding along the North Downs, high
above valleys and secret villages, it is easy to forget that suburbia
reposes below. Some 8,000 listed buildings, approached by private drives,
hide behind high beech hedges and rhododendrons.
When William Cobbett, author of Rural Rides, travelled through Betchworth,
Brockham and Dorking in October 1825 he wrote: 'There are few prettier rides
in England, and the weather was beautifully fine'. The comment about the
weather was well-founded; there is just enough rain (25 in annually, on
average) to stop the rhododendrons and hydrangeas wilting, but not enough to
spoil the bowls, tennis and golf that abound in Surrey. Gardeners delight in
the fertile soil, even though they may never aspire to the standards of the
300-acre Royal Horticultural Society gardens at Wisley.
The village of Brockham remains a pleasant corner of the county; the green,
on which WG Grace, the legendary cricketer, amassed some of his 54,000 runs,
is little changed, but common sense and the car demanded wider boundaries,
so a fine new cricket field has been allocated.
Brockham's charm lies in its whole; as with many Surrey villages there is no
outstanding single building - even the mortar and chalk 'clunch' church is
no more than a fair example of the Victorian period, the mortar being
scarcely dry when the good doctor was smiting leather with willow.
Close to the new cricket square, Fairbriar Homes is adding considerably to
the number of homes in Brockham at its Middle Green development. Prices
range from Pounds 93,450 for a two-bedroom flat up to Pounds 275,000 for a
five-bedroom detached house.
Surrey is often a barometer for the UK property market. There is something
for most pockets, but in spite of the recession this is still stockbroker
territory. Those who have really made it tend to head for St George's Hill,
a 1,000-acre estate of 365 grand houses on a ridge 200 ft above sea level.
Surrey is truly the land of the commuter; in spite of redundancies in the
past 18 months, leading to a fall of nearly 10 per cent in the number of
journeys, some 160,000 still travel by rail to London every day. Times must
be tougher, however - Haslemere, which always boasted the UK's highest
percentage of first class ticket holders, has recently lost its status to
Winchfield.
John Slatter, of Churchods, points to a noticeable rise in house sales
during the first five months of the year compared with 1991. Coupled with
that is a reduction of 10 per cent in instructions - result: greater
competition for fewer homes. There is, according to Guy Warren, of John D.
Wood, a pent-up demand for good houses, with expatriates and those in rented
accommodation competing with existing home owners wanting to trade up.
Defining the boundaries of commuter-county is not easy. For the past 20
years even the headquarters of the county council has been outside Surrey,
in Kingston-upon-Thames. Several other towns, including Richmond, Croydon,
Sutton, Merton, Cheam and even Surbiton ('Suburbiton', to some) are not
officially in Surrey, though the Post Office recognises them as such.
More than anything else it was the 19th century development of the railways
that lead to the development of the county. Tiny hamlets became bustling
towns. Purley, now part of the London Borough of Croydon, was a rural area
known as Foxley Hatch when the first steam trains chugged past on their way
from London to Brighton in 1841.
Wimbledon is just across the border from Surrey now, but as all eyes are now
be on the hallowed courts this is the time to mention some fine new houses
that have just been built there. Octagon's development of large detached
houses at Marryat Road, a mis-hit top-spin lob from the centre court, has
houses for between Pounds 295,000 and Pounds 950,000. Agents Hamptons says
it could easily find tenants prepared to pay Pounds 4,000 a month for the
larger homes.
For most, however, the charm of Surrey hides in its villages, many
approached by lanes beneath an enveloping canopy of trees, for in spite of
losing nearly 2m trees in the 1987 hurricane this is an umbriferous county.
There are contrasts, of course. One of the most charming villages is Shere,
with its 'Silent Pool' where it is said King John frightened to death a
maiden who was bathing there. Nearby is Box Hill, one of England's favourite
picnic spots. A five mile bridleway links the hill with Epsom Downs, scene
of the world-famous Derby since 1780. Higher still is Leith Hill, at nearly
1,000 ft above sea level the highest point in the south east.
So there is a lot more to Surrey than suburbia, and if we are to believe
agents such as Savills and builders like St George and Berkeley Homes, this
is the time to go house hunting.
Among the current crop of temptations on Savills' books is Spreakley House,
at Frensham, close to a large lake that was so conspicuous a landmark during
the Second World War that it had to be drained. The Elizabethan house, with
its cottage, ancient barn and more than five acres (with tennis court and
swimming pool, of course) has a price guide of Pounds 800,000.
Still up in the price stratosphere is Crooksbury House, near Farnham, which
was the first country house designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens. The house, valued
at around Pounds 1.25m by Aylesford, was built by the famous architect in
1890 and extended eight years later. It is largely unchanged, but someone
wanting to update the interior could live in one of the immaculate cottages
within the 15 acre grounds, says the agent.
The Square House at Hindhead sounds more of a snip at Pounds 325,000, the
price suggested by agent John D. Wood. The house was built in 1926 and has
six bedrooms, 2.5 acres and a proper pantry and wine store. The agent
originally sold the house to the late owner 22 years ago, and in her will
she requested that it acted as trustee.
