FT  24 AUG 92 / Construction Contracts: Transport projects in Jordan


Three Jordanian contracts have been won by RENDEL PALMER & TRITTON. Two of
them involve port installations and the third is for the railway
corporation.
At Aqaba RPT has recently completed a study and conceptual lay-out for a
multi-purpose berth for International Freight Services.
In a second assignment at Aqaba RPT is designing repair works, in
association with a Jordanian company, Madi & Partners, for a phosphate berth
which was struck by a ship last December.
The company has also been appointed by the Aqaba Railway Corporation to work
on a World Bank-funded project. This entails the inspection of 2,000 tonnes
of rail from British Steel, points and crossings from Balfour Beatty
Engineering, and timber sleepers in Singapore before shipment to Jordan.
