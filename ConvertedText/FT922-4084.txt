FT  08 JUN 92 / The Week Ahead


RESULTS DUE
Welsh Water, which attracted some unwonted attention last year with results
well ahead of expectations, should announce a more muted pre-tax rise of
less than 10 per cent to about Pounds 140m for the year to March. It remains
the only water company to have a stake in a neighouring electricity company,
and that investment has shown a healthy profit. On Wednesday, Northumbrian
Water, smallest of the 10, is expected to show the most progress with a 25
to 30 per cent increase in pre-tax profit to Pounds 60m. However, this
represents a rebuilding of margins after some heavy costs in its first year,
rather than a surge to a new level. It is still waiting the outcome of
public inquiries into plans to build waste incinerators.
The two dairy groups Unigate and Northern Foods are reporting annual profits
on Tuesday and Wednesday respectively. The contrast between the two has been
marked in recent years with Unigate's profits falling while Northern's have
climbed. These figures will see Unigate's profits beginning to rise again,
if only because it has sold loss-makers such as its chicken business.
Analysts are looking for around Pounds 90m pre-tax against Pounds 75.5m,
although there will be little underlying growth. Northern should continue to
see the benefits of heavy investment in the last few years in rising
profits, as well as a contribution from the Express Dairies and Eden Vale
businesses acquired two months before the March year end. Forecasts centre
on Pounds 125m pre-tax, up from Pounds 105.4m.
Analysts do not know what to forecast for Pilkington, the glass group, as it
has Pounds 30m to Pounds 35m of exceptional costs to cover redundancies and
the restructuring of the head office. If all these costs are taken in the
year to end March pre-tax profits could be as low as Pounds 70m, against
Pounds 151.6m, which would leave the dividend not just uncovered but under
water.
Racal Electronics, which announces annual results on Wednesday, has twice
forecast profits of about Pounds 50m pre-tax for the year to end-March,
against a Pounds 21.8m loss last time. That return will be after exceptional
provisions of about Pounds 30m for redundancies. The main interest, however,
is likely to be in details of the Chubb demerger and also whether the
recovery is still on track.
Vodaphone will be questioned closely on how it plans to cope with
lower-priced competitors preparing to enter the telecoms market when it
announces annual profits on Tuesday. Analysts are expecting pre-tax profits
of about Pounds 267m, compared with Pounds 245m, and a final dividend of 6p.
