FT  23 APR 93 / Spain acts to defend peseta's EMS rate


   By TOM BURNS


   MADRID


THE BANK of Spain raised its unofficial intervention rate yesterday and
intervened strongly on the money markets to defend the peseta's central
parity rate with the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary
System.
Speculation against the peseta brought it down to a low of Pta73.10 to the
D-Mark before the Madrid authorities took action, raising the overnight rate
from 13.35 to 14 per cent and part of Spain's Dollars 45bn (Pounds 29.2bn)
reserves were put aside for the peseta's defence.
The action served to steady the peseta and lifted it to Pta72.80 against the
D-Mark, above its Pta72.88 parity in the Exchange Rate Mechanism. The
markets are however watching for clearer signals today when the Bank of
Spain sets its benchmark intervention rate at an auction for certificates of
deposits.
The attack on the peseta, and the defence of it, highlighted the nervousness
surrounding the Spanish currency, for the developments occurred before
Germany's Bundesbank cut its Lombard and discount rates.
At the root of speculation against the peseta is the political instability
that has engulfed Spain ever since Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez last week
announced a snap election to be held on June 6.
Fuelling the speculative attacks is, on one hand, the belief that the
Spanish economy is in the midst of a recession and that the peseta is
strongly overvalued, particularly in the wake of the Bundesbank's rate cuts.
On the other hand, the market perception is that the ruling Socialist party
will do all that lies within its power, using the Bank of Spain's reserves
as necessary, to ensure monetary stability before the elections.
