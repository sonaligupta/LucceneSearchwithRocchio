FT  28 JAN 94 / Rexrodt plays for big stakes in energy

By drafting legislation aimed at opening up Germany's energy sector to more
competition, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the economics minister, is taking on part of
the country's establishment, officials said yesterday.
Mr Rexrodt wants the country's electricity grid and gas networks to be
thrown open to foreign and domestic competition. This would reduce energy
prices, which for some categories are the highest in the European Union and
break the political and economic influence held by giant utilities such as
RWE, PreussenElektra and Bayernwerk.
Officials from RWE, the largest utility, said Mr Rexrodt's plan were not
surprising. 'Its not really a new theme (from the ministry) we are hearing.
Let us see the final draft legislation,' he said.
But officials from Veba, the energy-based conglomerate whose electricity
subsidiary, PreussenElektra, holds a fifth of the market in western Germany,
said the measures should be matched by greater competition in the rest of
Europe. 'Everyone says the energy sector in Germany is a monopolistic
structure. But what about other EU countries,' he said.
What makes Germany different is that there is no single formal regulatory
body overseeing electricity pricing. The regional utilities, or the
distribution companies, must agree their tariffs with local municipalities,
which often own part of the utilities.
However, officials in Bonn and Brussels are sceptical that Mr Rexrodt can
succeed, particularly in an election year, although they realise he has to
try.
