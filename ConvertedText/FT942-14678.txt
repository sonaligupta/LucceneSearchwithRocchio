FT  19 APR 94 / International Company News: Fotex offer nets Dollars 70m


   By NICHOLAS DENTON

Fotex, the private Hungarian retail group, has raised Dollars 70m in new
capital through the largest international equity offering by an east
European company.
CS First Boston, global co-ordinator, said the offer had been fully
subscribed. It was taken up by institutions in Europe and the US, including
CS First Boston's own Dollars 200m Central European Fund.
Mr Gabor Varszegi, Fotex's chief executive, principal shareholder and
eastern Europe's richest individual, subscribed to the new issue and
maintained his holdings at 24 per cent.
Fotex and CS First Boston had planned to raise between Dollars 80m and
Dollars 100m, but adverse market conditions curtailed their ambitions.
Prospects of a rise in US interest rates, and sharp falls on the Turkish and
Warsaw stock markets, contributed to nervousness among investors. Fotex
raised Dollars 54m via an international placement in 1991.
