FT  26 JUN 92 / International Company News: March family buys up shares to
merge banks


   By TOM BURNS


SPAIN's March family has been forced to buy out minority shareholders in its
investment bank Banco de Progreso before merging it with Banco Urquijo, the
medium-sized retail bank that it also controls.
The developments follow the failure of negotiations for the sale of Banco de
Progreso to La Caixa, the Barcelona-based savings bank.
Madrid's stock market commission yesterday suspended trading in Progreso
following an announcement that Corporacion Alba, the March family holding
which owns 40 per cent of Progreso's equity, was offering Pta2,700 per
Progreso share.
The price represents a 12.5 per cent premium and values Progreso's
five-branch network at Pta20.1bn (Dollars 205m).
La Caixa, Spain's biggest financial institution, had signed a letter of
intent to acquire Progreso a month ago. The savings bank had aimed to move
into corporate banking through the purchase, but it is understood to have
objected to the concentration of Progreso's loans and to the price set by
the March family.
The decision to merge Progreso with Banco Urquijo that has been suddenly
forced on the family involves a potentially messy partnership between two
distinctly different institutions. Originally, the March family had hoped to
boost Banco Urquijo, whose profits dropped by 20 per cent last year to
Pta3.7bn, with funds from the sale of Progreso.
