FT  25 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Beverley proposing capital restructure


   By PETER PEARSE


BEVERLEY GROUP has announced proposals for a capital reorganisation to
enable it to pay dividends.
In April, under its old Petrocon name, it failed to acquire James Wilkes, a
rival engineering group, in a hostile Pounds 35m bid.
In its recently published 1991 accounts, Beverley, which was acquired by
Petrocon in March for Pounds 2.68m, revealed a deficit on the profit and
loss account reserves of some Pounds 6.68m making dividend payments
impossible until future profits had paid off the shortfall.
To rectify this, the board has proposed reducing the share capital and
writing off the share premium account. This will result in a small reserve
of about Pounds 699,000 against which goodwill from future acquisitions can
be written off. The ability of the company to distribute this reserve will
be restricted by undertakings to the High Court.
Under the reorganisation, which is subject to shareholder approval at an
extraordinary meeting on September 15, existing shares of 12 1/2 p will be
sub-divided into one new ordinary of 7 1/2 p and one deferred of 5p.
Rights on the 7 1/2 p shares will be no different from those on the existing
shares, but they will be nominal on the deferred.
If the High Court allows, the deferred shares will then be cancelled  -
reducing the aggregate nominal value of the shares in issue from Pounds
4.35m to Pounds 2.61m  - and the Pounds 6.58m standing to the credit of the
share premium account written off.
After the cancellation of the deferred shares, there will be a Pounds
400,000 difference between the authorised and the issued ordinary share
capitals. At the EGM the board will seek approval to allot shares up to an
aggregate nominal amount of Pounds 130,000 until the annual meeting in 1993.
Yesterday Beverley's shares were unchanged at 10p.
