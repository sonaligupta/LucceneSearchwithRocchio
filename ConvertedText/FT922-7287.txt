FT  19 MAY 92 / Observer: Moving up


If any captain of industry needs reminding how important it is to cultivate
the City, he could do a lot worse than plot the career of Sir David Plastow
who picked up another prestige job yesterday - the chairmanship of Inchcape.
He is already deputy chairman of the TSB and Guinness and has collected an
impressive list of other non-executive directorships.
Sir David's career at the helm of Vickers, one of the grand old names of
British engineering, is said to have been a great success. He rescued
Rolls-Royce Motors from bankruptcy, merged it into Vickers and tried to
knock some sense into a company which had long since lost its way. He has
campaigned against geriatric chief executives who hang on well past
retirement age, so there is no surprise that he is leaving Vickers this
month.
Even so he is leaving a company which has just cut its dividend and where
there is a question mark over its future strategy and untested leadership.
Some investors might wish that Sir David had waived his own retirement rules
and stuck around to pilot Vickers out of its current problems.
The chairmanship of a successful company like Inchcape should pose a less
daunting challenge.
