FT  26 JUN 92 / Iran-Contra prosecutor probing at 'highest level'


   By JUREK MARTIN, US Editor


   WASHINGTON


FURTHER indictments in the Iran-Contra scandal could occur this summer,
including charges against those at the highest level of President Reagan's
government, according to Mr Lawrence Walsh, the US chief special prosecutor.
In a report to Congress yesterday, Mr Walsh's office named no-one under
suspicion for having sought to conceal the shipment of arms to Iran in 1985,
which was intended to secure the release of hostages in Lebanon and the
proceeds of which were used to finance the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, in
contravention of a Congressional ban.
Mr Caspar Weinberger, defence secretary in the Reagan administration, was
charged last week by a grand jury with having lied about his knowledge of
the arms shipments. He has subsequently pleaded innocent and the provisional
date for his trial is the eve of the presidential election in early
November.
Mr Walsh's report hints that others of comparable seniority in the Reagan
government might also be implicated, and that the investigation should be
completed this summer.
'We are attempting to determine,' the report says, 'whether officials at the
highest level of government, acting individually or in concert, sought to
obstruct official inquiries into the Iran initiative  .. by supplying a
false account of the 1985 arms sales from Israeli stocks.'
The indictment against Mr Weinberger drew attention to a meeting on November
24 1986, attended by Mr Reagan, at which Mr Edwin Meese, then
attorney-general, is said to have given the opinion that a shipment of Hawk
missiles from Israel to Iran in 1985, though later authorised by the
president, may have contravened the Arms Export Control Act.
