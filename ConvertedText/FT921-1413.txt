FT  24 MAR 92 / Election 1992: The Lady turns to the north - Ballot Box


Margaret Thatcher's speech with John Major on Sunday is regarded as having
done the Tories proud. But will the same be said of her trip today to
Scotland?
Thatcher is still anathema to most Scots. Indeed, some people say that her
government bears heavy responsibility for pushing Scotland towards
devolution or separatism.
There is little evidence that anyone in the Scottish Tory party actually
wanted her to campaign in Scotland; it appears that she offered to go and
nobody was able to dissuade her.
That she will be supporting Michael Forsyth in his Stirling constituency is
no surprise: he was the most Thatcherite of the Scottish Office team and her
great ally.
He has, however, publicly accepted many tenets of Majorism since then, and
last year produced a pamphlet called 'A country at ease with itself'.
The constituents of both Forsyth and Bill Walker, MP for Tayside North which
Thatcher is also visiting, know the Thatcherite feelings of their MPs.
One wonders, however, about the people of Edinburgh West, a further port of
call, where the MP is Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, another Scottish Office
minister.
Lord James is the most popular member of the Scottish Office team. Very
little dirt from the Thatcherite period has stuck to him, partly because he
was given few controversial things to do and partly because everyone could
see that, as well as being an Oxford boxing blue, he was such a nice man.
With a majority of only 1,234, it could be that the less he has to do with
the former prime minister the better.
