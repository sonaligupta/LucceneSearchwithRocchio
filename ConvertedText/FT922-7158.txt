FT  20 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Rationalisation helps Readicut


   By ANGUS FOSTER


READICUT International, the household textile, carpeting and yarn company,
weathered recession in its main markets to report profits at the top end of
market expectations.
The company announced a 11.6 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds
13.5m in the year to March 31, despite a fall in turnover to Pounds 220m
(Pounds 226m).
Professor Sir Roland Smith, chairman, said tight cost controls introduced in
the last two years led to a 'quite remarkably profitable performance'.
The workforce was cut by 5 per cent in the UK, with additional cuts in the
US and the Netherlands, at a cost of Pounds 639,000. This follows an 11 per
cent cut in the previous year.
Mr Clive Shaw, managing director, said the UK's recession had bottomed out
and the US was improving. But continental Europe remained depressed  - '1992
is going to be tough there', he said.
Interest costs fell steeply to Pounds 2.67m (Pounds 3.54m) due to lower
interest rates and reduced net borrowings of Pounds 11.5m (Pounds 12.8m),
equal to 19 per cent of shareholders' funds (21 per cent).
Earnings improved to 4.79p (4.25p). The company is recommending a maintained
final dividend of 2.81p to make an unchanged total of 3.44p. Dividend cover
improved from 1.2 times to 1.4 times.
There was an extraordinary charge of Pounds 1.37m due to Firth Furnishing's
withdrawal from seating fabrics. The division returned to profit during the
period and will begin manufacturing for Ford in Belgium and Honda in the UK.
Readicut's shares were unchanged at 85p.
COMMENT
Readicut's results were well received by the market, which is beginning to
see the benefits of the last two years of rationalisation come through.
Firth Furnishing's performance and Firth Carpets improved profits, were also
pleasing given their respective exposure to the depressed car and retailing
sectors. But the company's gloomy forecasts for Europe, and the likelihood
of no great improvement in the UK, suggests a return to late 1980s levels of
profitability remains elusive. Forecast profits of Pounds 15m put the shares
on about 15 times, which is below the sector average. Despite a strong run
over the last 12 months, the shares can go higher if there are sustained
signs of recovery on the high street.
