FT924-11531

FT  26 OCT 92 / The week ahead


RESULTS DUE
WELLCOME, the UK pharmaceuticals group, reports its full-year results on
Wednesday. Few surprises are expected and pre-tax profits of between Pounds
500m and Pounds 505m are forecast (Pounds 402.9m last year).
Sales of Zovirax, its herpes, shingles and chicken pox treatment, should
have topped Pounds 600m for the year, putting it in the world's top 10
selling drugs for the first time.
Sales of Retrovir, the anti-HIV treatment also known as AZT, will have risen
about 19 per cent for the full year to about Pounds 210m.
Wellcome's margins will also be under scrutiny. The new management has
undertaken to increase margins to 30 per cent by 1996. Analysts believe they
should improve 2.4 percentage points to about 27 per cent this year.
Imperial Chemical Industries, Britain's biggest manufacturer, announces its
third quarter results on Thursday. They will be watched even more carefully
than usual because of the proposed split of the company next year into two
separate groups. Pre-tax profits are likely to be grim, at around Pounds
100m compared with Pounds 196m last year.
Most of analysts' predictions for next year are based on an upturn in the
cycle. A gloomy forecast from Sir Denys Henderson, chairman, is likely to
lead to further downgrades.
In addition, attention will be given to the fortunes of Tenormin, a heart
treatment whose US patents expired in September last year.
Marks and Spencer, which single-handedly accounts for some 30 per cent of
the market capitalisation of the stores sector, is likely to make some
encouraging noises about its trading prospects when it reports its interim
results on Wednesday.
Against a background of ambivalent signals about the state of consumer
spending, M and S's views will be seen as being of critical importance in
gauging sentiment towards the sector.
Stringent cost control measures will have enabled the company to lift
pre-tax profits by as much as 16 per cent to Pounds 250m. The company's
aggressive 'Outstanding Autumn Value' advertising campaign is also likely to
add to its confident mood.
However, M and S's food business, which accounts for 40 per cent of sales,
will have continued to face severe competitive pressures. Analysts will be
particularly interested to hear of any new initiatives in this field.
Blenheim Group, the exhibitions manager, is expected to announce pre-tax
profits of about Pounds 34m for the year to 31 August when it announces
second interim results tomorrow.
Analysts will be watching for signs Blenheim's recent rapid growth is
slowing, and for the trading outlook in its important French market.
Reed International, the publishing group, reports interim results on
Wednesday. Pre-tax profits of about Pounds 92m (Pounds 85.3m) are forecast.
The market will also be eager for more details on its proposed merger with
Elsevier of the Netherlands.
