FT  16 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Siemens


It is encouraging that Siemens is predicting a 20 per cent increase in net
profits in the current year, but this does not mean a revolution in the
group's poor competitive position. The expected turnaround at the ailing
Siemens Nixdorf information technology subsidiary is one factor: recovery
here is welcome, but long overdue and Siemens should have bitten the bullet
and pulled out of this business years ago. Another factor is likely to be
reduced spending on rationalisation, which absorbed DM2.7bn (Pounds 1.1bn)
in the last financial year. This was far more than its net profits of
DM1.65bn, and yet the headcount has dropped by a modest 21,000 out of a
total workforce of 382,000 people.
This year Siemens is likely to cut 12,000 jobs, but it should be doing more
to cut costs. The message is underscored by the publication yesterday of the
first segmental breakdown of operating profits. The table showed that
telecommunications accounted for more than half the group's non-financial
profits. That is more than expected and reveals heavy dependence on a market
vulnerable to price pressures in the run-up to Deutsche Telekom's
privatisation. Analysts meeting the company in Munich today should press
hard on how it intends to deal with the challenge, if not through further
cost-cutting.
