PLACER Dome, the Canadian resources group, Minorco, the Luxembourg-based
investment company, and its parent, the Anglo American Corporation of South
Africa, have bought stakes in two leading copper projects in Chile.
Minorco yesterday said Minera Mantos Minorco had completed the acquisition
of a third of a big Chilean copper project, Collahuasi. Minera Mantos
Minorco, a new company 50.1 per cent owned by Minorco with the rest owned by
Empresa Minera de Mantos Blacos, in turn controlled by Anglo American, is to
pay about Dollars 190m to acquire the stake from Chevron, the US oil group.
Royal Dutch/Shell and Falconbridge, share equally the other two thirds of
Collahuasi deposit.
Minorco believes Collahuasi's start-up date will be 1996-97.
In a separate deal, Placer Dome has paid Dollars 100m to Outokumpu Copper
Resources of Finland for a 50 per cent interest in the Zaldivar copper
deposit in the Atacama desert. Placer Dome has also agreed to provide loan
financing of up to Dollars 400m towards the estimated Dollars 500m cost of
constructing a mine and treatment facility.
The partners expect to complete Zaldivar's feasibility studies by the middle
of next year. If they decide to proceed with the project, the mine is
scheduled to begin production in 1995.
The acquisitions underscore Chile's leading position as a Mecca for mining
multinationals. The Chilean Copper Commission, Cochilco, estimates mining
companies will invest almost Dollars 5bn before the end of the decade to tap
the country's vast mineral wealth. Nowhere else in the world are there so
many projects close to fruition.
