FT  04 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading


   By JOEL KIBAZO


Profit-taking in Footsie futures marked the last day of the equity account
in the derivatives sector following heavy buying in the preceding 3 weeks,
writes Joel Kibazo.
A poor start was followed by sporadic buying of the September contract on
the FT-SE 100, which saw it reach the day's high of 3,087 in the first hour.
It managed to hold its ground for the rest of the morning before the
afternoon sell-off that was led by local traders.
However, the contract managed to maintain its premium to cash throughout the
session and having fallen to a low of 3,066, September ended the session at
3,068, down 18 on its previous close, and about 4 points ahead of its fair
value premium to cash of about 7. Volume was thin, reaching 7,275 contracts.
The traded options once again had an active session though total turnover at
30,610 was down on Thursday's 38,684 lots. Some 7,218 contracts were dealt
in the FT-SE 100 option and 3,985 in the Euro FT-SE 100. Amstrad was the
most active stock option at 2,961 lots.
