FT  24 MAR 92 / Winning goal for Detroit in World Cup

THE decision to play the first ever World Cup soccer game indoors was taken
yesterday when Fifa, the sport's governing body, announced that the
Silverdome stadium near Detroit, Michigan, would be one of nine locations
for the 1994 tournament.
The Silverdome, normally home to the Detroit Lions American football team,
will lay natural grass over its artificial turf for the 24-team tournament,
which is due to be played across the US between June 17 and July 17 1994.
Previously experts have doubted whether grass would survive in an indoor
stadium, but the Silverdome is confident grass will last for the two or
three weeks necessary.
There are expected to be few complications in preparing the other eight
sites chosen by Fifa. They are: Giants Stadium in New Jersey; Foxboro
Stadium near Boston; Soldier Field in Chicago; the Cotton Bowl in Dallas;
the Citrus Bowl in Orlando, Florida; the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California;
Stanford Stadium near San Francisco; and RFK Stadium in Washington DC.
A decision on which site will host the final has not been taken, although
the Rose Bowl is hot favourite because of its 102,000 capacity and the
favourable climate in southern California. The choices were made after the
27 cities which bid for the games were pared down in October to 19. Among
those turned down were Atlanta, Denver, New Orleans, Philadelphia and Miami.
