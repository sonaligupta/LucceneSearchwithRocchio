FT  27 SEP 94 / International Company News: CarnaudMetalbox venture off


   By JOHN RIDDING

CarnaudMetalbox, the Franco-British packaging group, yesterday announced the
collapse of plans to merge its health and beauty businesses with Wheaton,
the privately-owned US packaging group.
The planned merger, announced in June, would have created the world's
largest beauty and healthcare packaging concern with annual sales of FFr5bn
(Dollars 940m). It failed because of difficulties in the past few weeks,
said CarnaudMetalbox.
'After extensive discussions we have been unable to resolve some
differences,' said Mr Jurgen Hintz, chairman of the Franco-British group. He
said the decision not to pursue the merger had been amicable and joint
development projects between the two companies remained possible.
The failure is thought to have centred on reservations by some of Wheaton's
shareholders about their level of control of the 50-50 joint venture.
Virtually all of Wheaton's shares are held by relatives of the family which
founded the group. Under the terms of the agreement, Mr Hintz was to be
chairman of the joint venture, while Mr Bob Veghte, from Wheaton, was to be
chief executive officer.
CarnaudMetalbox said it was disappointed by the collapse, which it described
as an attractive strategic move. The aim was to strengthen its position with
cosmetic, pharmaceutical and perfume manufacturers and to provide a broader
geographical presence.
The two companies said they had sought to derive benefits from pooling
research resources and technical know-how and from expanding their
operations in south-east Asia.
CarnaudMetalbox said it remained committed to developing its health and
beauty packaging businesses.
