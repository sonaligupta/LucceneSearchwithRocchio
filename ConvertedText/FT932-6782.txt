FT  27 MAY 93 / China frees dissident after 12 years in jail

AN UNREPENTANT Mr Xu Wenli, one of China's longest serving dissidents, was
freed from jail yesterday three years before his 15-year sentence expired.
His early release, apparently aimed at calming criticism in the west of
human rights violations, came as China faced censure after an EC mission to
Tibet.
Appearing gaunt and with several of his teeth missing, Mr Xu denied any
wrongdoing on his release, saying his political activities had been 'for my
country and my people'.
Mr Xu, 49, one of China's best-known dissidents, was arrested in 1981 and
sentenced the following year. He had published an underground magazine,
April 5 Forum, during the Democracy Wall protest period of the late 1970s
and is the sixth political prisoner to be given early release this year. The
gesture coincides with Washington's decision, due by next week, on renewal
of China's Most Favoured Nation trading status. It also appears to be aimed
at improving its chances of winning the right to stage the 2000 Olympiad.
Mr Xu's release came as EC representatives met in Beijing to complete a
report of their recent mission to Tibet. The mission ended in recrimination
at the weekend with envoys protesting over detention of two Tibetans who had
been planning to make contact.
Kieran Cooke adds from Singapore: China says it will not use force to pursue
its claim to the spratlys, the disputed group of islands in the South China
Sea.
