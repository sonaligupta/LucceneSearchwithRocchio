FT  27 JUL 92 / Observer: Union block


Still on the subject of women's career prospects (or lack of them), one
wonders how much longer Britain's elderly trade unions can march out of step
with the new look Labour party.
On the same day last week that Labour elected a record number of women to
its front-bench team - it leads the Government five to two on this score -
Diana Warwick resigned as general secretary of the Association of University
Teachers. Not so long ago there were four female trade union bosses. Now
there is only one - Elizabeth Symons of the Association of First Division
Civil Servants.
Sogat's Brenda Dean and Helen McGrath of the National Union of Hosiery and
Knitwear Workers, both lost their jobs as a result of mergers with other
unions and 47-year-old Warwick is off to run the Westminster Foundation for
Democracy. Interestingly, it sounds like Unison, which will be Britain's
biggest union and Europe's largest public service union, will be run by men
even though two-thirds of its executive committee will probably be women.
