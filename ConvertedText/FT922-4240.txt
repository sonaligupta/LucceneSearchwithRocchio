FT  06 JUN 92 / Finance and the Family: At a glance - Innovative pension
launches


Two companies are launching pension products with innovative charging
structures. Irish Life is offering clients a single investment contract for
pension planning, which is aimed at cutting charges. Units in the plan can
continue to accumulate, with no switching charge, between personal pension
plans, additional voluntary contributions and executive pension schemes.
This makes the policy more portable and eliminates problems with transfer
values.
Foster & Braithwaite is launching a personal pension plan with three funds -
cash, a managed fund, and investment trusts - in a scheme administered by
Provident Life. Units in the fund will have no bid-offer spread, again
easing many of the difficulties with transfers. Maximum initial commission
for intermediaries is 20 per cent, with a management charge of 2 per cent
and a Pounds 4 per month policy charge. IFAs will be paid  1/2 per cent of
the value of the fund thereafter.
