FT  13 APR 94 / International Company News: Olivetti negotiates Dollars 280m
stand-by credit

   MILAN


Olivetti, the Italian computer group headed by Mr Carlo De Benedetti, has
negotiated a stand-by credit of Dollars 280m with eight Italian and
international banks, the company announced yesterday.
Since last Thursday, Italian and French companies in which Mr De Benedetti's
family has an interest have announced a string of share and convertible bond
issues.
The five-year stand-by credit brings to more than Dollars 1.1bn the amount
of potential funding which will be available to companies in the De
Benedetti stable, assuming shareholders approve the plans for share and bond
issues.
Olivetti said yesterday that the credit, arranged for the group's
Luxembourg-registered subsidiary Olivetti International, would allow the
company to spread its medium to long-term debt over a longer period,
strengthening the overall financial structure.
The group claimed that this was one of the biggest credit lines arranged by
a private Italian company in more than a year.
The Italian group may need access to extra funds to pay for its one-third
share of the L3,000bn (Dollars 1.8bn) investment in a new mobile telephone
network in Italy.
Olivetti heads the Omnitel-Pronto Italia consortium which won the licence
for the GSM network last month. The computer company last week announced
plans to underpin this investment with a convertible bond issue, which could
raise between L500bn and L600bn.
The five-year stand-by credit line was arranged by JP Morgan Securities.
Eight other banks will participate with Dollars 35m each.
Olivetti will pay interest of Libor plus 0.625 per cent for the first two
years, and Libor plus 0.75 per cent for the final three.
