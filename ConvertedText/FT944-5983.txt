FT  01 DEC 94 / Boost for inner city police candidates


   By MOTOKO RICH


A novel scheme to prepare underprivileged candidates for the job application
process has resulted in the induction of 10 recruits into the Merseyside
police force today.
The programme, run by the Industrial Society, helped disadvantaged and
unemployed adults from the Granby and Toxteth areas of Liverpool - the scene
of race riots in 1981 - to gain confidence and skills required to apply for
jobs with the police.
Merseyside police has experienced difficulty in recruiting qualified
candidates from inner city areas and ethnic minority groups.
The Industrial Society, with funding from the Granby Toxteth Task Force,
Merseyside Training and Enterprise Council, the Employment Service and the
police authority, selected 15 candidates.
During the 10-week, full-time course, Industrial Society trainers helped the
candidates improve their reading and maths skills, practice interview
techniques, and prepare for police fitness standards.
None of the candidates was guaranteed a job although all were granted an
initial interview.
