FT  19 MAY 92 / People: Sharing in a 'significant movement' for the private
investor


David Senior and Pam Mapes are the latest recruits to ProShare and the cause
of 'trumpeting the private investor'.
Senior, who is 33, arrives from ICI, where he had latterly been group
marketing and advertising manager involved among other things in the World
Class campaign. He says he left ICI, where he had been since university,
because he found 'an exciting opportunity to be in at the inception of what
I hope will be quite a significant movement'.
ProShare, launched in February as an outgrowth of the Wider Share Ownership
Council, is out to promote 'wider and deeper share ownership' with the help
of the likes of chairman Sir Peter Thompson - famed for making the lorry
drivers rich in the NFC buyout - president Sir John Harvey-Jones, and
ex-Tootal boss Geoffrey Maddrell as chief executive.
Senior comes in as director of company services where a big part of his job
will be to promote better employee share ownership schemes at a wider
cross-section of companies. He will also be encouraging UK firms to service
the private investor more effectively - using simpler language - at a
reasonable cost.
Meanwhile Pam Mapes, 39, becomes director of education at the group which
Maddrell has called 'a sort of Automobile Association for the private
investor'. She will be spreading the message to teachers, college lecturers,
adult education course directors and the like. She was until 1990 head of
marketing communications at the stock exchange, marketing information
products such as Topic and Seaq.
