FT  30 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Utd News. rights


   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY


Overseas acquisitions are likely to be top of the shopping list for United
Newspapers following yesterday's Pounds 190m cash call, and analysts were
generally in agreement that the company had made a sound move.
There was some feeling that the company - which refused to be drawn on the
exact nature of the potential acquisitions - might have been more open about
its intentions. Mr David Forster at Smith New Court was slightly bearish,
saying that the market would have preferred 'a flavour' of what the targets
would be. But he believed the one-for-five rights issue at 480p would be
'grudgingly' taken up.
The share price slipped back 11 to 574p in a volume of 1.3m - a modest
decline which some analysts read as a confident market comment. The offer
was also largely seen as well-priced at a discount of 18 per cent to the
market price.
'Despite the dilution in earnings, it is a good move,' said one analyst who
was unconcerned at the vague nature of United's acquisition intentions.
'They are only expected to look at small things - there would be some
concern if it was thought they were looking at big things.'
United also made a confident forecast on its profits for the first six
months of this year.
