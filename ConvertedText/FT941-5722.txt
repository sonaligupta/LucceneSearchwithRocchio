Hong Kong Electric, which operates the colony's electric power monopoly, has
met market expectations with a 10.8 per cent rise in profits to HKDollars
3.38bn (USDollars 437m) for the year to December 31, from HKDollars 3.05bn
in 1992, writes Louise Lucas in Hong Kong.
Earnings per share were 167 cents, up from 151 cents, and shareholders are
to receive an improved dividend of 57 cents, giving a total for the year of
90 cents compared with 82 cents the previous year.
Mr George Magnus, chairman, said Secan, the group's property development
associate, contributed 19 per cent of pre-tax profits last year and was
expected to make a further injection as more tower blocks come on line this
year.
