FT  27 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Liberty family defeats enfranchisement
proposal


   By PETER PEARSE


THE FOUNDING family of Liberty defeated yesterday a proposal to enfranchise
all shareholders, and thus undermine their control of the fashion and fabric
group.
Mr Brian Myerson, an investor, was backed by only 19.7 per cent of the
voting shares and 24 per cent of the non-voting shares at the extraordinary
meeting he had requested. He needed 50 per cent and 75 per cent respectively
for his proposals to be carried.
Concerto Capital Corporation, his family's investment vehicle, owns a little
more than 15 per cent and 7 per cent respectively of the two classes of
shares.
The meeting, held in a training room at Liberty's West End store, was
attended by more than 100 shareholders. Mr Myerson presented his case for
the enfranchisement of the non-voting shares, the appointment of additional
non-executive directors to the board and the splitting of the roles of
chairman and chief executive.
