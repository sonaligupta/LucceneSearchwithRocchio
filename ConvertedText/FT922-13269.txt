FT  13 APR 92 / US Money and Credit: Good and bad news bring confusion


   By NIKKI TAIT


GOOD news and bad news suffused the US bond markets in speedy succession
last week. The result was confusion.
The best came first. Bond prices raced higher after the Federal Reserve
moved to lower interest rates on Thursday morning, by adding reserves to the
banking system through a round of overnight system repurchase agreements.
The action came when the Fed funds rate was trading below 4 per cent, and
was immediately interpreted as a decision by the authorities to lower the
rate by 25 basis points. The new target rate stands at 3 3/4 per cent.
It was a signal which the market had been anticipating for months - only to
see its hopes dashed in the past. A week previously, for example, bond
prices rallied when two reports revealed US money supply was shrinking and
employment expanding slowly at best. Speculation that an easing of monetary
policy was in view grew again during the first trading sessions last week.
As a result, the yield on the benchmark long bond slipped to 7.88 per cent
by Tuesday night.
Wednesday, admittedly, brought a sharp reversal, but this was largely thanks
to a Dollars 9.75bn auction of seven-year Treasury notes. Seven-year notes
have a reputation for poor reception among investors, and this issue proved
no exception. By the end of the day, the long bond yield - reflecting
weakness in the market overall  - had risen to 7.91 per cent.
But Thursday, with Fed funds easing, was another story, and the yield on the
30-year bond quickly returned below the 7.9 per cent mark. Yet, even then,
the response at the long end of the market was far less pronounced than
among shorter-term securities - a steepening of the yield curve which
underlined the markets' puzzlement over the timing and size of the interest
rate cut.
The confusion is understandable. On the one hand, those pundits who believe
the economy needs real stimulus to kick-start it, are convinced that the
authorities have sat on the sidelines for too long. The latest move, in
their view, scarcely remedies the situation: a small easing of the Fed funds
rate, for example, is unlikely to generate any change in commercial banks'
lending rates.
'The Fed's move this week was unexpected and hard to justify in terms of the
particulars for its timing - it was about two months late,' commented Mr
Robert Brusca at Nikko Securities. 'It is hard to argue that the move
damaged anything . . . (but) the Fed must learn to link its moves to
events.'
By contrast, those economists who are more sanguine about the economic
prospects, were equally baffled. 'Why so soon?' questioned pundits at Smith
Barney. 'March employment growth was disappointing but total hours worked
held up reasonably well, and private sector surveys suggest some increase in
hiring activity over the months ahead. Private surveys of the March retail
sales situation also were downtrodden, but the chain store sales data for
March didn't seem as bad; it was essentially a mixed bag.'
Twenty-four hours later, when the March consumer price inflation data
arrived, the situation was muddied further. The consumer price index report
showed a 0.5 per cent rise, significantly higher than the 0.3 per cent rise
which experts were predicting. The so-called 'core' rate for March - which
excludes energy and food prices  - rose 0.5 per cent.
The bond markets' knee-jerk reaction was to plunge by more than half a
point, before deciding that - given all the other economic news recently -
this was really not so bad. By the end of the week, the long bond yield had
rallied sufficiently to stand at 7.88 per cent, from the 7.87 per cent a
week earlier.
Next week's smattering of statistics will include March retail sales,
projected to be flat to modestly lower (partly because of Easter's timing),
and industrial production for the same month. The latter is forecast to show
a very small rise - perhaps 0.2 per cent, after a 0.6 per cent gain in
February - with the capacity utilisation rate unchanged.
No doubt, the figures will be examined from every angle. Whether they
clarify the meaning of the Fed's latest move, and hence give the market a
better sense of whether further easing can be expected, is another matter
altogether.
