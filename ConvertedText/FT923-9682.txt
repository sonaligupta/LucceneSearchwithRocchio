FT  04 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Pounds 52m loss on US sale for Reckitt &
Colman


   By MAGGIE URRY


RECKITT & Colman, the household products, toiletries and food group, is
taking a Pounds 52m extraordinary loss on the sale of its US spices and
seasonings business.
The sale price is Dollars 75.1m (Pounds 39.1m), but there will be an
extraordinary loss of Dollars 100m in the current year's accounts. The buyer
is Burns Philp Food, a subsidiary of Burns Philp, an Australian food and
hardware company.
The extraordinary item comprises the loss on disposal of assets, valued at
Dollars 99.5m, goodwill written off, Dollars 50m of closure and redundancy
costs while Dollars 18m represents a trading loss made since the sale
decision was made in January.
However, the sale will add Dollars 40m to Reckitt's cash flow in the current
year. The proceeds will go to reducing borrowings, which were Pounds 338.3m
at the end of 1991.
In January Reckitt said the business, part of the Durkee-French subsidiary,
was being sold for Dollars 80m, but since then trading conditions have
worsened and the price reduced.
Reckitt bought Durkee Famous Foods from Hanson, the Anglo-American
conglomerate, in 1986 for Dollars 140m. The spice and seasoning part of
Durkee has found the market increasingly competitive. In 1991 the business
being sold made a pre-tax profit of Dollars 2.2m.
Reckitt said the sale was part of its strategy of disposing of non-core
assets where a price could be obtained that would not dilute earnings.
The group is also negotiating the sale of its Canadian spice and seasoning
business to Burns Philp, although that deal has not yet been completed. The
price stated in January was Dollars 8m.
