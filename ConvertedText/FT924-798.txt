FT  22 DEC 92 / Letter: Story of the east still to be told


   From Mr ROSS MACDIARMID


Sir, Samuel Brittan should be wary of lauding the 'four tigers' - South
Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore - too highly (Economic Viewpoint,
December 17). I have recently worked in Taiwan for 18 months and government
statistics from this part of the world are highly suspect. For example
inflation in Taiwan was recently thought to be too high, so the index was
changed and inflation was thus reduced - problem solved?
New technology is the motor of gross domestic product and in these economies
 -which are still at the 'catch-up' state with the west - it is relatively
easy to grow by importing foreign technology to a low-cost workforce. The
hard part is developing new technologies beyond the bounds of existing
foreign expertise and so far the omens are not good. Entrepreneurs are
showing relatively little interest in new technological investment at home,
preferring instead to shift low technology production to mainland China,
Malaysia, Vietnam, etc. This has created a crisis in the form of huge
capital outflows. The full story of the four tigers remains to be told.
