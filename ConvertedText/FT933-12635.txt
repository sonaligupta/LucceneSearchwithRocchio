FT  23 JUL 93 / The Maastricht Vote: Defeated PM says issue must not
'fester'


Mr John Major's announcement to the Commons after the government was
defeated:
'The House has not come to a resolution as required under section seven of
the European Communities (Amendment) Act and so the act cannot come into
force. We clearly cannot leave the matter there.
'Tonight's debate has shown that there is no majority in this House for the
UK to join the social chapter. There is however, as we know, a majority of
this House in favour of ratifying the Maastricht treaty.
'I therefore invite the opposition parties who say they support ratification
and respect the opinion of this House to reconsider their position.
'We must resolve this issue and it cannot be permitted to fester any longer.
'I therefore give notice that the government will invite the House to come
to a resolution tomorrow in support of the government's policy on the social
chapter by putting down a motion of confidence in the following terms: 'That
this House has confidence in the policy of Her Majesty's government on the
adoption of the protocol on social policy.''
Mr John Smith's reply to Mr Major:
'On a point of order, Madam Speaker, the prime minister may seek to maintain
that there was no vote in the House for the social chapter. There was not
vote against it. The plain fact is that the House tied.
'There will therefore be, when the resolution is posed, - and I notice the
prime minister has been driven to use the confidence factor because he
cannot win the vote on any other basis - but when he tables his resolution,
we on this side will table an amendment that will give a tied House of
Commons the opportunity to vote positively for the social chapter tomorrow.'
