FT  29 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Broadgate sells EBRD leasehold


   By DAVID BLACKWELL


BROADGATE PROPERTIES has sold for Pounds 170m cash its long leasehold
interest in One Exchange Square, home of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development in the Broadgate development near London's
Liverpool Street station.
The purchaser of the 999-year leasehold interest is Deutsche Grundbesitz
Investmentgesellschaft. Jones Lang Wootton, who advised the German
investment group, believes the sale to be the largest individual property
investment transaction in London for more than two years.
The building comprises 360,000 sq ft of office accommodation and 12 retail
units. The EBRD leases the office space for a rent of Pounds 14.4m a year,
not including ground rent to British Rail, the freeholder.
Broadgate Properties said the effective value of the sale was worth a total
of Pounds 179m to the company. The property had a book value of Pounds 165m
on its last audited consolidated balance sheet in June 1992.
The company will use the proceeds to repay in full the bank mortgage of
Pounds 135m on the property and add to working capital. After the sale total
debts will be about Pounds 750m, down from Pounds 1.2bn a year ago.
Broadgate Properties is 50 per cent owned by Stanhope Properties, which
continues to trade, and 50 per cent by administrative receivers called in
last year by Rosehaugh, the joint developer of the Broadgate complex.
Broadgate is also thought to have either let or have under offer 350,000 sq
ft at its Ludgate development near St Paul's Cathedral. It said yesterday
that once the 500,000 sq ft development was let it would be close to
breaking even.
