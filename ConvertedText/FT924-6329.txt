The Ministry of Defence has launched the Services Home Savings Scheme for
members of the Armed Forces. Those who save between Pounds 50 and Pounds 200
a month for 60 months will be entitled to an additional payment, called the
Home Savings Allowance (HSA), when they buy a home. The HSA will be paid at
a rate of Pounds 1 for every Pounds 3 saved in the account, including
interest earned.
