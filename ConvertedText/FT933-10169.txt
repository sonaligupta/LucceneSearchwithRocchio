FT  05 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Beales Hunter bears out forecast at Pounds
2.2m


Beales Hunter, the refrigeration and electrical components company, reported
a pre-tax profit of Pounds 2.24m for the year to May 31, bearing out the
profits warning made in June.
The company said then that a disappointing second half meant that the annual
profit would not match the previous year's Pounds 2.3m. That figure was
restated in yesterday's results at Pounds 1.86m under FRS 3.
Group sales in the 12 months rose to Pounds 47.8m (Pounds 41.7m). Earnings
per share came to 16.2p (15.6p).
The final dividend is maintained at 6.95p, for a total of 9.4p (9.25p).
