FT  30 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Blow a multimedia raspberry


   From Mr DAVID JEWSBURY


Sir, The convergence between telecommunications and cable television
('Multimedia superhighways', October 15) is truly remarkable and seems to
promise us untold benefits. In the midst of all this high technology, can no
one invent a gadget that will identify and disconnect (preferably with a
loud raspberry) Tania and Jacqui, the ubiquitous telesales persons who
constantly try to sell me something I neither want nor need, usually at a
time of greatest inconvenience.
