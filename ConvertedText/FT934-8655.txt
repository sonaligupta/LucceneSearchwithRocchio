FT  13 NOV 93 / Briefcase, Q&A: Paying IHT on gifts


AN ARTICLE in the FT Guide for the Serious Investor stated: ' . . .if you
have surplus income after tax and normal living expenditure, then this
income can be given to your children without inheritance tax being payable
if properly structured.' Could you please answer these questions?
1. Can such gifts out of income be made to people who are not your children?
2. Do you have to furnish proof that, in such cases, you have not exceeded
your income?
3) Do you need formal documents to make such gifts in cash? And what does
'properly structured' mean?
1. Income gifts can be made to people who are not your children.
2. The Inland Revenue might ask you to justify your claim that the payment
is made out of income and, therefore, you need evidence to show this to be
the case. Your tax return should provide the information to compute your
income and your tax payable, and you should keep a note of annual spending
in the year.
3. The gifts could be accompanied by a covering letter. It should be clear
to the recipient that this is not just a 'one off' capital gift but that you
intend to make the payments for the foreseeable future.
This reply was provided by Barry Stillerman of accountant Stoy Hayward.
