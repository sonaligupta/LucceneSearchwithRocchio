FT  13 MAR 92 / Japanese defence group fined over illegal arms sale

JAPAN Aviation Electronics Industry, a defence equipment maker affiliated to
NEC, the electronics combine, has been fined Dollars 15m (Pounds 8.5m) for
illegally selling US military technology to Iran, Stefan Wagstyl reports
from Tokyo.
The company paid the fine and pleaded guilty to 10 of 22 charges in a plea
bargaining agreement with the US Justice Department.
The US and Japanese governments are lifting most of the sanctions imposed on
JAEI last year when the offences came to light. The company was banned by
the US from manufacturing defence-related products made under licence from
US companies. The Japanese Defence Agency suspended contracts with JAEI.
The US authorities plan to keep the company on a watch-list for three years,
during which the export ban would be automatically reimposed if any
suspected new offences were unearthed.
JAEI is a world leader in aerospace navigation technology and if the bans
had persisted, Japan's defence procurement programmes could have been
disrupted.
The company was charged with selling Iran navigation equipment for military
jets which had been made under licence from US contractors. JAEI allegedly
conspired with Aero Systems, a Florida-based company, to carry out the
illegal exports in 1986. The sales contravened the US Arms Export Control
Act.
Mr Hisao Kaneko, the JAEI president, yesterday apologised to the defence
agency, to other ministries and to clients for having caused a scandal which
influenced even Japan's defence programme and the US-Japan security treaty.
After the settlement, JAEI revised its corporate financial forecast. It
expects a Y3.3bn pre-tax loss in the year to the end of March, more than the
previous estimate of Y2.4bn. The results would be worse but for the sale of
a Y3bn parcel of land.
