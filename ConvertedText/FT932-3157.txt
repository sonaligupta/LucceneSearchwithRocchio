FT  15 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Ramco slides to Pounds 349,000


   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES


RAMCO OIL Services saw its pre-tax profits fall to Pounds 349,000 in 1992,
against Pounds 526,000 the year before, when the outcome was boosted by
exceptional credits.
At the same time, the company announced it was extending its participation
in Azerbaijan to two additional oilfields in conjunction with Pennzoil, the
US energy group.
Ramco's turnover increased from Pounds 4.11m to Pounds 5.43m, reflecting the
first full year's results for Ramco Pipeline Services and the impact of
overseas contracts in Japan and Norway.
The company's Russian joint venture - Ramco Alnas - which produces electric
submersible pumps for the oil industry, made a profit of Pounds 272,000 - of
which Ramco received Pounds 136,000.
Last year the venture sold and installed Alnas pumps in North America,
Germany, Russia, North Africa and the Middle East.
In addition, Ramco extended its interests in the former Soviet Union through
its participation with Pennzoil in the 1.4bn barrel Gunashli field in the
Azerbaijan sector of the Caspian Sea. The company announced yesterday it
would be extending this partnership to the Azeri and Chirag fields.
Ramco has also begun work on a new oil and gas development in the Tyumen
region of western Siberia in a joint venture with a group of US investors.
The company said its work in Azerbaijan had placed it in a unique position
for a company of its size.
Earnings per share dipped to 1.88p, against 2.39p, and the company declared
a dividend of 1p - down from 2p.
