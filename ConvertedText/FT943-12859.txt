FT  22 JUL 94 / Observer: Short circuiting


The Kafkaesque problems besetting Russia's ailing enterprises have taken a
new twist. Normally, energy suppliers are the main victims of non-payments.
But one of the country's biggest oil producers had its electricity cut off
on Wednesday - for not paying bills of Rbs150bn.
The Siberian oil giant, Nizhnevartovskneftegas, says 900 of its oil wells
have stopped production after the electricity authorities cut it off. A
special oil and fuel ministry commission is now heading east from Moscow to
settle the dispute.
Nizhnevartovskneftegas reckons it in turn is owed more than Rbs300bn - some
Dollars 150m - for unpaid oil bills.
What was that about paying pipers and calling tunes?
