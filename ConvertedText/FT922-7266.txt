FT  19 MAY 92 / Government Bonds: German bunds advance as engineering
dispute ends


   By SIMON LONDON and PATRICK HARVERSON


   LONDON, NEW YORK


GERMAN government bonds rose strongly through the morning session yesterday
following the announcement of a 5.8 per cent pay settlement in the dispute
between engineering employers and unions.
The benchmark 8 per cent Unity bond maturing 2002 closed at 100.26-34 for a
yield of 7.96 per cent. On Friday the benchmark closed at around 99.97,
where the yield was 8 per cent.
On Liffe, the London futures and options exchange, the June bund futures
contract opened at 87.41 but rose rapidly to hit a high of 87.69. Later in
the day the contract settled to 87.61 and closed at around this level.
Volume was heavy at 79,000 contracts.
While analysts were encouraged by the break-through in pay talks, which
could avert damaging industrial action in key sectors of the German economy,
economic data released later this week could dampen enthusiasm.
Producer price inflation data for April is expected this week and is
believed to show only a slight slowdown in the annual rate of increase from
2.5 per cent in March.
The Bundesbank council holds a regular meeting on Thursday, at which it
could decide to tighten monetary conditions.
However, most analysts thought it was unlikely the central bank would act
ahead of the release of money supply data, which is scheduled for next week.
The Bundesbank's favoured monetary indicator is M3, a broad measure of money
supply. In March, M3 grew at a year-on-year rate of 9.7 per cent, against a
target range of 3.5 to 5.5 per cent. If money growth is higher in April, the
Bundesbank may raise rates.
THE UK government bond market was swept higher by the buoyant mood in
continental Europe and optimism over the outlook for UK inflation, following
the release of better than anticipated retail prices data on Friday.
The June gilt futures contract on Liffe opened at 99.12, having broken the
psychologically important barrier at 99.00 on Friday.
The contract rose to 99.16 during the day, the next significant resistance
barrier according to analysts, before settling to 99.14 by the close of
trading. Volume was sluggish at 24,000 contracts.
In the cash market, the benchmark 9 per cent long-dated gilt maturing 2011
closed at 100 7/8 , for a yield of 8.896 per cent, from an opening level of
100 1/2 .
With the market in a positive mood, the Pounds 850m new gilts launched by
the Bank of England on Friday were quickly exhausted. The bank sold stock in
maturities ranging from 1994 to 2008.
Analysts attributed the positive tone to improved expectations on inflation
following RPI data released on Friday which showed prices rising at a year
on year rate of 4.3 per cent, better than anticipated.
The positive outlook on inflation was reflected in the money markets, where
inter-bank rates remained below the 10 per cent base lending rate for the
first time since rates were cut on May 5. Interbank funds from one month to
one year were trading at around 10 - 9 7/8 per cent.
Tomorrow, the market will be watching retail sales figures for April, hoping
for a post-election improvement in consumer spending.
Retail sales showed a year-on-year fall of 3.7 per cent in March in the run
up to the election. Analysts are hoping for positive annual growth of at
least 2 per cent for last month.
US Treasury prices firmed slightly in quiet trading yesterday as investors
turned their attention to today's meeting of the Federal Reserve's
policy-making Open Market Committee.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  5/32 at 102
7/32 , yielding 7.801 per cent. The two-year note was also firmer, up  1/32
at 100 9/16 , to carry a yield of 5.050 per cent.
In the absence of fresh economic data, prices edged higher on hopes that the
FOMC will authorise an easing of monetary policy. Analysts are divided as to
the likelihood of another cut in interest rates. Last week's
bigger-than-expected growth in money supply dampened expectations of an
ease, but there are enough optimists in the market to keep prices on an
upward bias until after the FOMC meeting.
If the Fed does agree to ease, observers believe it would act promptly,
probably before tomorrow's two-year note auction.
JAPANESE government bond prices were firmer overnight in Tokyo, with the
strength of the yen on the foreign exchange markets and the buoyancy of
equity prices boosting confidence.
The benchmark government bond issue No. 129 closed the Tokyo day on a yield
of 5.515 per cent, sharply better than the 5.535 per cent seen at the close
on Friday.
Bond prices slid at the end of last week as the equity market slumped and
traders focused on the exposure of Japanese financial institutions to
Olympia and York, the troubled property development company.
However, yesterday the Nikkei 225 stock market index rose 368 points to
close at 18,443.
The yen also strengthened against the dollar, breaking through Y130
overnight and consolidating gains in European trading. By late afternoon in
London, the Japanese currency was trading at Y128.75 against the dollar.
