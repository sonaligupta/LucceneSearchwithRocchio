FT  16 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Time for minister to speed up the
search


   From Mr J M L STONE


Sir, Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, has called for councils to
handle standard enquiries 'within 10 working days' ('Quicker land searches
urged', March 12).
In the last years of the 20th century this is an absurd call. Mr Gummer
should seek to ensure, as a matter of urgency, that the whole of the
conveyancing process should become a real-time screen-to-screen process. The
hardware, the software and the technical know-how to effect this are all
immediately available to his department. At a stroke, conveyancing could, if
the will were there, become a fast, efficient and cheap process which would
benefit 99 per cent of the nation at the expense of 1 per cent (the
lawyers).
