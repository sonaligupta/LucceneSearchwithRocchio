FT  19 MAY 92 / Ramos widens lead in Philippine presidential election

ACCUSATIONS of fraud among candidates in last week's Philippine presidential
election further fuelled uncertainty yesterday, as Mr Fidel Ramos, the
administration-backed candidate, widened his lead in the count.
With nearly 32 per cent of the estimated 26.7m votes counted last night, Mr
Ramos, former defence chief, had a margin of 301,900 votes over Mrs Miriam
Defensor Santiago, the combative former immigration commissioner who had
claimed victory early in the slow vote-counting process.
Mrs Santiago had accused her rival of 'wholesale election fraud' and
threatened to launch protest demonstrations. Her camp announced plans to
divulge evidence of the alleged fraud tomorrow.
Mr Eduardo Cojuangco, a business associate of the late President Ferdinand
Marcos, maintained his hold on third slot. Mr Cojuangco, claiming that he
would take the lead once the votes from the provinces were tallied, had
accused the administration of Mrs Corazon Aquino of illegal spending to
influence the vote.
Mrs Imelda Marcos, the once-powerful widow of the late dictator, another
candidate, yesterday refused to appear in a court arraignment in connection
with charges of illegal currency holdings overseas.
She said she would boycott all court hearings - she is facing more than 50
suits in various courts - in protest against what she alleged as widespread
fraud in the election. She was still in fifth position yesterday in a field
of seven candidates.
The Manila stock market composite index, after an upbeat mood last week
following a generally peaceful May 11 polling, yesterday fell 21.26 points,
or 1.6 per cent, to to 1,317.11.
