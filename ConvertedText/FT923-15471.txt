FT  02 JUL 92 / Arts: Today's Television


   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY


Tonight, as so often on summer evenings these days, it looks as though you
will be better off in the garden with a book, weather permitting, or
sampling some Australian Chardonnay or Peruvian Sauvignon, than watching TV.
Of course the book or the wine or both could be accompanied by your personal
stereo tuned to Radio 3 which, at 7.30, offers the BBC Symphony Orchestra
playing the world premiere of a piece by Edward Shipley, followed by Brahms'
Violin Concerto and Nielsen's Symphony No 5.
The funniest thing about supercilious documentaries which look back to the
moral codes of earlier ages and snigger is their blindness to the equal
absurdity of today's codes. True Stories undertakes to reveal all about
'Heavy Petting', the teenage substitute for sex in fifties America,
promising us a 'hilarious documentary'. Can you imagine how funny
television's assiduous toeing of the politically correct line on Aids is
going to look in 40 years time? BBC1's tabloid telly series 999 (9.30) which
shows films or reconstructions of heroic rescues today screens an amateur
video record of the boy who fell into the gorilla pit at London Zoo.
