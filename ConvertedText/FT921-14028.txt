FT  17 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Paris Match to withdraw autopsy pictures


   By REUTER


A PARIS court has ordered Paris Match magazine to withdraw an issue
featuring autopsy photographs of Mr Robert Maxwell and allegations that he
was hit before his death, reports Reuter.
The court, acting at the request of Mrs Elizabeth Maxwell, the media
magnate's French-born wife, issued an interim injunction late on Wednesday
also ordering the weekly to pay FFr100,000 (Pounds 10,300) provisional
damages to Mrs Maxwell.
The court also ordered bailiffs to ensure that the offending issue,
published last week, was removed from news stands.
The autopsy photographs were accompanied by what the magazine said was a
partial transcript of a conversation between Israeli and UK pathologists who
examined Mr Maxwell's body in Tel Aviv before his Jerusalem burial in
November.
Paris Match quoted French specialists as saying the body showed numerous
traces of blows before death. Dr Iain West, one of the British pathologists
involved, dismissed the allegations as nonsense.
In its latest issue, Paris Match said it had spoken to the three Israeli
pathologists in Tel Aviv who were under orders not to talk.
