FT  14 APR 94 / UK Company News: Savoy back in the black with Pounds 0.73m


   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent


Savoy Hotel yesterday announced a turnround from pre-tax losses of Pounds
1.43m to profits of Pounds 725,000 for the year to December 31 but is
proposing to halve its dividend.
In 1992 Savoy, whose hotels include the Savoy, Claridge's and the Connaught,
paid a maintained dividend of 7p on its A shares and 3.5p on its B shares
because it believed recovery was on the way.
However, yesterday the group said this did not take place as quickly as
expected and business only picked up in the middle of September. Although
this improvement had been maintained in 1994, Mr Giles Shepard, managing
director, said the group thought it prudent to reduce the dividend to 3.5p
per A share and 1.7p per B share.
Earnings per A share were 1.8p, against losses of 1.3p, while earnings per B
share were 0.9p (0.6p losses).
Mr Shepard said occupancies at the group's hotels were currently running at
between 63 per cent and 65 per cent, compared with less than 60 per cent in
the first half of last year. He said average room rates last year were
Pounds 193 excluding VAT, compared with Pounds 186 in 1992. Room rates this
year were at about the same level as in 1993, he added.
Turnover rose by 8.5 per cent to Pounds 83.3m (Pounds 76.8m) with the second
half showing a 13 per cent rise compared with 3 per cent in the first half.
Operating costs rose by 6.2 per cent to Pounds 74.8m. Staff costs increased
by only 2.3 per cent. However, the cost of raw materials and consumables
increas-ed by 5 per cent. Savoy said this was partly because of the increase
of business in the second half.
Operating profits amounted to Pounds 1.55m (Pounds 57,000 losses). The
pre-tax result was struck after higher investment proceeds of Pounds 589,000
(Pounds 229,000) and reduced interest costs of Pounds 1.41m (Pounds 1.6m).
