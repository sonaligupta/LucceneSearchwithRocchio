FT  16 JAN 92 / OECD labour ministers urge improved job market efficiency


   By IAN DAVIDSON


   PARIS


LABOUR ministers from the industrialised countries have agreed on the need
for concerted medium and long-term measures to combat high unemployment,
starting with steps to improve the efficiency of labour markets.
The ministers, meeting at the Paris-based Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development, endorsed a three-part programme of action, in
which improved labour markets were coupled with the provision of skills for
the future and the improvement of coherence between different aspects of
economic and social policies.
There was broad agreement by the ministers that 'positive incentives to
participate in employment should be provided through appropriate gradual
adjustment of income support measures'.
They also recommended 'more effective and comprehensive training and
re-employment programmes for the unemployed and those on welfare and social
assistance, while assuring necessary support mechanisms, thereby breaking
dependency cycles'.
