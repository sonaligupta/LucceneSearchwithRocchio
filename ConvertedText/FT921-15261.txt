FT  11 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Darby quits NHL and warns of future
essential refinancing


   By DAVID BARCHARD


MR JOHN DARBY, chairman of National Home Loans Holdings, yesterday told
shareholders at the company's annual general meeting that he was stepping
down.
At the same time he warned shareholders that refinancing, either via a third
party or a rights issue, would eventually be necessary.
His remarks appeared to confirm the view of some analysts that NHL intends
to seek cash from its shareholders once negotiations with a new backer are
completed.
No replacement has yet been named for Mr Darby, a non-executive chairman who
has headed NHL since it was set up in 1985. His decision follows a
disastrous year for the company in which it plunged to losses of Pounds
47.9m after making bad debt provisions of Pounds 88.7m.
In October, Mr Darby also resigned as chairman of Ultramar, the oil and gas
company, a month before it fell to a hostile bid from Lasmo.
NHL said yesterday that Mr Darby, chairman of Arthur Young, the accountants,
for more than a decade, would not receive any compensation. When he left
Ultramar, Mr Darby received a pay-off of Pounds 680,000.
News of the resignation was announced at a meeting in which small
shareholders challenged the board to account for NHL's misfortunes this
year.
One investor said that he and his wife owned 1.5m NHL shares between them.
He pointed out that in little more than two months, the company's estimate
of necessary provisions had jumped from Pounds 16m to Pounds 88.7m and he
asked whether the increase had been suggested by the auditors.
Mr Darby told shareholders that the company's cash flow was still positive,
though unpaid interest had to be taken into account. The rest of the board
will continue in place.
