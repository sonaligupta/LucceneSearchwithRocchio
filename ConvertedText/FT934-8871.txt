The former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan will dump the rouble on Monday,
bringing in a new currency with full support from the International Monetary
Fund, President Nursultan Nazarbayev said yesterday, Reuter reports from
Alma Ata.
In an address to the Kazakh people, Mr Nazarbayev said Kazakhs could swap up
to 100,000 roubles per person for new 'tenge' banknotes at an initial rate
of 500 roubles per tenge.
Kazakhstan currently uses old rouble banknotes dating from the Soviet era
and emblazoned with pictures of Soviet state founder Vladimir Lenin.
