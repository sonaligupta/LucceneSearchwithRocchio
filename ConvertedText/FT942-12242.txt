Kitty Little, the USM-quoted spectacles and fresheners group, fell into
pre-tax losses of Pounds 245,000 for 1993, against profits of Pounds
150,000. The company blamed losses at the Samco acquisition and adverse
factors in the sunglass business.
Turnover was Pounds 4.09m (Pounds 4.74m) and operating losses of Pounds
156,000 from acquisitions left group operating losses of Pounds 107,000
(Pounds 369,000 profits). Losses per share were 2.8p (1.05p earnings) but
the final dividend has been maintained at 1p for a total of 1.5p (1p).
The shares were suspended on April 11 on the announcement that it was
acquiring Groupe L'Amy, the spectacle frame maker. A further announcement on
details and funding is promised as soon as possible but should be before
June 30.
