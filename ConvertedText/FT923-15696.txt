FT  01 JUL 92 / Letter: Environment is an issue for EC, not nation states


   From Mr SIMON HUGHES MP


Sir, I am a strong supporter of devolving power to the lowest level at which
it can most usefully be wielded, which is one way of interpreting the
Euro-doctrine of subsidiarity. But the proposal being aired at the Lisbon
European Community Summit to return many environmental powers to nation
states are, quite frankly, bonkers.
Take the example of bathing water quality. Your article on the Summit
outcome ('A state of limbo in Lisbon', June 29) suggested that Chancellor
Kohl of Germany viewed bathing water quality as a prime candidate for return
to nation states. He is ignoring the simple fact that pollution and
environmental degradation are no respecters of national boundaries nor
coastlines.
The toxic waste which Britain still dumps in the North Sea does not
necessarily stay in British territorial waters, but could well end up
blackening beaches of other EC nations. Mr Kohl should have learnt that
lesson from the decades of unchecked pollution that the old West Germany
suffered from its East German neighbours.
As Britain takes up the presidency of the Council of Ministers one of the
key tasks of the Community in the next few years will be to bring together
nations to protect and promote the environment.
If Britain cannot break the diplomatic deadlock over the setting up and
siting of the proposed European Environmental Bureau then the environment
secretary, Michael Howard, should push forward with his idea of an
environmental inspectorate.
It is better compliance with EC law that is needed - not a retreat from
Community-wide laws to protect one country from the pollution of others.
