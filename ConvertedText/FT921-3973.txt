FT  11 MAR 92 / Observer: Prone position


Understandably, Britain's big drinks companies are always nervous about what
will happen to them on budget day.
But for Allied-Lyons it seems to be a particularly accident-prone day. Last
year, it reported a Pounds 147m foreign exchange loss and lost its finance
director. This year the planned merger of its UK brewing operations with
Carlsberg was referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
