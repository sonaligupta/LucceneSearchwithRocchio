FT  19 MAY 92 / OECD Annual Meeting: Labour reforms will bring more jobs,
says UK


   By PETER NORMAN


ECONOMIC growth would be firmly established in Britain this year, ensuring
that the UK played its part in a sustainable world economic recovery, Mr
Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, forecast yesterday.
Thanks to the labour market reforms of the past decade, he said, Britain
would be able to sustain a higher level of employment without succumbing to
inflationary pressures than in the early 1980s.
Mr Portillo told the OECD annual ministerial meeting that Britain was
continuing those reforms with measures to restrain unofficial strikes.
Changes in education and vocational training would lead to higher standards
and a better qualified workforce.
There was a danger, however, that European Community social policies could
intensify unemployment by making labour markets less flexible. The draft EC
directive on working time, which Britain opposes, could impose an additional
cost of around Pounds 5bn on UK employers, he said.
Mr Portillo underlined that he and other ministers from the OECD's 24
industrialised member states saw 'no quick fix' to the problem of
unemployment. But confidence was returning to Britain, he said. The full
benefits of lower inflation and the drop in interest rates from 15 per cent
in October 1990 to 10 per cent today had yet to come through.
