FT  12 MAR 94 / US sales figures feel the chill


   By MICHAEL PROWSE


   WASHINGTON


US retail sales rose sharply last month but a large downward revision to
figures for January indicated the rate of growth of consumer spending has
probably moderated since the end of last year. The Commerce Department said
sales rose 1.5 per cent last month and by 7.5 per cent in the year to
February. But officials also revised down estimates for January to show a
decline in sales of 1.6 per cent from December rather than the fall of 0.5
per cent initially reported. The figures are not adjusted for inflation.
'The weather is playing havoc with first quarter data,' said Mr Joseph Liro,
chief economist at S G Warburg in New York. He said flat sales in January
and February taken together reflected the very cold weather and the impact
of the earthquake in southern California. A large increase in sales was
likely this month, he said.
