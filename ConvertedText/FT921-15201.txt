FT  11 JAN 92 / Motoring: Audi offers more than mere size


   By STUART MARSHALL


AUDI HAS aimed the new 80 range straight at the executive 'user chooser' who
is more impressed by quality and technology than mere size.
The seven models available in Britain have engines ranging from a 90
horsepower 2-litre 4-cylinder to a 174 bhp, 2.8 litre V6.
Five of the new front-wheel driven 4-door saloons are priced below the
Pounds 19,250 barrier at which the company car tax penalty rises steeply.
The cheapest is the Pounds 13,998 entry model called simply the Audi 80. An
ultra-clean, ultra-economical direct-injection turbo-diesel, due here in
early spring, will be Pounds 14,974.
There are two quattros with permanently engaged four-wheel drive.
One has a 2-litre, 16-valve engine putting out 137 horsepower, the other the
2.8 litre V6. Both, unfortunately, cost more than Pounds 19,250. The 2.0 16v
is Pounds 19,998 and the V6, Pounds 21,798.
I say unfortunately because quattro transmission is something one easily
becomes hooked on and may eventually feel naked without.
A friend of mine who switched from a well-loved A-reg. 90 quattro to a Saab
900 still does.
The more powerful the car, the greater are quattro transmission's benefits
in easy control and safety. Obviously, all-wheel drive is seen at its best
in real winter weather when a quattro keeps going in conditions no two-wheel
driven car could cope with. But there is more to it than that.
Putting the engine's power on the tarmac through four tyre contact patches
makes a muscular car better balanced when accelerating hard.
What I enjoyed most about the 80 2.8E quattro was being able to exploit its
eager performance without fear of losing tyre grip. Overtaking in the wet
was quick and confident; on fast corners it was security itself. As a bonus,
it ran arrow straight on the most blustery motorway.
Not all that many of the 80s sold here will be four-wheel driven. The cost
is high; a 2.0 16v quattro is Pounds 19,998 against Pounds 16,798 and the
2.8E quattro, Pounds 21,798 compared with Pounds 19,249. And automatic
transmission (a Pounds 974 extra on most of the petrol engined 80s) is not
available on 80 quattros.
A rather lumpy 5-speed gearshift and too much tyre roar on coarse surfaces
were the only real drawbacks to my test car. A total redesign of the rear
end has given the new Audi 80 a boot as generous as the old model's was
meagre.
Ride and upholstery are firm, though not uncomfortably so. The interior,
though sombre, stops just short of being funereal.
