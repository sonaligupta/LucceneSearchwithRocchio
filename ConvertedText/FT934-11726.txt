FT  29 OCT 93 / International Company News: Foster's in ADollars 99m
flotation of Elders


   By BRUCE JACQUES


ELDERS, the Australian rural group once central to the corporate empire of
Mr John Elliott, is being refloated to the public through a ADollars 99m
(USDollars 66m) offering.
The float, rumoured for some weeks, involves the sale for ADollars 311m of
the Elders business by Foster's Brewing group, the Australian beermaker, to
a new company, Elders Australia Ltd.
The new company will offer ADollars 98.7m in shares at ADollars 1 each, with
up to 30 per cent of the float reserved for sale to Australian farmers
through the Farmers Investment Trust. A further 15m Elders shares will be
offered to existing Fosters' shareholders.
The transaction continues the sale of surplus assets by Fosters', now
controlled by BHP, the Australian resources group. Fosters' chief executive
officer, Mr Ted Kunkel, said yesterday the sale price represented a book
loss of about ADollars 10m, but this had already been provisioned.
The sale price involves ADollars 89m for the main Elders pastoral business,
including wool-broking and livestock marketing, and a further ADollars 222m
for the company's rural loan book.
Mr Kunkel said proceeds from the sale would be used to reduce Foster's debt,
which fell from ADollars 4.1bn to ADollars 2.6bn in the latest June year.
The sale excludes Elders' 45 per cent stake in Australian Meat Holdings, one
of the country's biggest meat groups.
