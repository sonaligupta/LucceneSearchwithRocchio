FT  21 OCT 92 / People: Non-executive directors


J Sainsbury, the UK's biggest grocery chain, has cannily enlisted the
expertise of the former permanent secretary at the Department of the
Environment by appointing Sir Terence Heiser as a non-executive director.
Sir Terence's inside knowledge of the UK's planning policies will no doubt
come in handy to the supermarket chain as it continues to lay down new
stores at a furious rate. He becomes Sainsbury's fourth non-executive
director filling the position vacated by Lord Prior, the former Tory
minister, who retired at the last annual meeting.
Since his retirement this year, the 60-year-old civil servant, who headed
the DoE during the turmoil of the poll tax, may well have found more time to
indulge his passions for reading, walking and talking.
Unfortunately, he will have little time to talk to Lord Sainsbury about the
company before he hands over the chair to his cousin David in early
November.
