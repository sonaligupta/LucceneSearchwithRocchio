FT  16 JAN 92 / Child care groups unite


SEVEN child care groups have joined forces in an effort to place child care
on the political agenda in the run-up to the general election.
The coalition includes the Pre-school Playgroups Association, the Working
Mothers Association and Gingerbread, the support group for single parents.
Ms Lucy Daniels, association director, said: 'As the general election
approaches, politicians of all persuasions are looking for votes.
'Child care is such an important issue for children, women, families and the
economy that no party can afford to sit on the fence.'
The seven groups are seeking a national strategy to provide affordable child
care. Demands include:
Access to playgroups and nursery education for all children aged three or
four.
Statutory parental leave and maternity leave as in EC recommendations.
A partnership of parents, employers and the government to fund the provision
of child care.
