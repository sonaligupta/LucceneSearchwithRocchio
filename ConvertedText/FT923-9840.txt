FT  03 AUG 92 / Observer: Salty


Whether or not Britain's economic tide is still ebbing, management theorists
are in full flood with fresh slogans - sorry, 'metaphors' - aimed at
inspiring company chiefs to follow their ideas.
In particular, perhaps because top executives are often sailing buffs, the
metaphor-mongers are going overboard on seafaring imagery. An example is
'permanent white water', used to represent the ceaseless change now facing
companies.
The nautical natter has clearly impressed the esteemed Tavistock Institute
of Human Relations. 'Such metaphors,' says its latest annual review,
'conjure up visions of organisations emerging from tedious and dutiful
voyages down well-charted and sluggish waterways to face a tempest-lashed
open sea.'
'Aye, 'appen,' said the FT's resident sceptic on management theories when he
was shown the review's prose. But there was one thing, he added, that calm
or tempestuous, the climate would never change. 'Whatever the water, it's
shark-infested.'
