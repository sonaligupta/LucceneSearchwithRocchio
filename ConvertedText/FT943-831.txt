FT  27 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Bank considers pension fund
gilts


   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent


The Bank of England is considering ways to design gilt-edged securities for
UK pension schemes which have been wound up by an insolvent employer or have
large numbers of deferred pensioners.
Impetus for the move comes partly from the expectation that many pension
schemes of insolvent UK employers will be wound up following a European
Court of Justice ruling on sex equality on Wednesday. UK schemes have been
waiting four years for the judgment.
Wound-up schemes, which do not receive contributions from members, need to
ensure they can meet the liabilities of former employees who may not retire
for many years.
Contracts to ensure that such benefits are paid are sold by insurance
companies but cost far more than pension schemes typically allocate for
deferred liabilities.
The Bank has been approached by numerous groups urging the creation of
securities for pension schemes which do not need to earn cash flow from
their investments immediately. However, once the liabilities become due,
they will need an inflation-linked investment return over a period of many
years.
One plan calls for the creation of long-term gilts issued as zero-coupon
bonds for a period of 5, 10 or 20 years. At maturity they would pay interest
at an agreed rate over, say, a 10-year period. Alternatively, they could pay
a rate equal to the retail price index or five per cent, whichever is lower.
From April 1997, all UK pension schemes will be required to increase
benefits to pensioners at that rate.
