FT  01 DEC 94 / ANC moves on mining


   By MARK SUZMAN


   JOHANNESBURG


South Africa's ANC-led government has released a draft policy document on
mineral and energy affairs which calls for the unbundling of mining
conglomerates and the expansion of public ownership of mineral rights to
facilitate the growth of small-scale, black mining. When presenting the
document in Johannesburg yesterday, Ms Cheryl Carolus, the ANC's head of
economic policy, emphasised that the proposals represented a basis for
discussions with the industry and other stakeholders and would probably be
revised substantially before becoming official party policy, let alone the
basis of new legislation.
