FT  23 APR 93 / Mercedes turnover slides 24%

MERCEDES-BENZ, mainstay of Germany's Daimler-Benz group, hopes to stop the
profits rot this year in spite of a 24 per cent slump in turnover and
unspecified operating losses in the first quarter.
While Daimler's group net earnings are expected to slump by 30 per cent to
around DM1bn (Pounds 400m), Mercedes should show a result 'similar' to last
year's DM849m, Mr Helmut Werner, incoming chief executive, said yesterday.
This implies that the group's non-automotive businesses, including Deutsche
Aerospace, AEG engineering and the Debis software and financial services
division, will contribute a mere 15 per cent of total earnings, against 42
per cent last time.
In conditions one executive described as 'ploughing through fog', Mr Werner
Niefer, retiring chief executive, said attempts to prepare forecasts were
blighted by 'many imponderables'.
The company had high hopes of its new compact C-class range, a replacement
for the 10-year-old 190 series, the company's smaller executive car, which
will be launched in June, but he did not expect any marked improvement in
markets for cars, buses or trucks before the end of this year.
The so-called C-class was expected to start having a positive effect on
operating results by next year, when, according to one manager, the company
hoped to snatch back market leadership from BMW. Last year Mercedes was
overtaken in unit sales by its Bavarian rival for the first time.
Mercedes expects to build 200,000 of the new model in 1994, compared with
output of 120,000 compact cars in 1992.
This year, however, Mr Niefer said he expected total car output unchanged
from last year's 486,000 while commercial vehicles would fall slightly from
the 1992's 260,000.
In the 1993 first quarter, turnover from cars had fallen 30 per cent, while
unit sales had dropped 32 per cent. Sales revenue from commercial vehicles
was 16 per cent lower on unit deliveries down 20 per cent.
As part of continuing economy measures, at least a further 7,000 German jobs
will be lost this year, after a cut of 14,700 in 1992. Some DM500m had been
set aside in provisions for personnel measures.
