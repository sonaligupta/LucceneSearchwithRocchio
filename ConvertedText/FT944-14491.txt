FT  22 OCT 94 / World Commodities Prices: Spices


The short period of reaction in the pepper market following the steep price
rises in September apparently is already behind us, reports Man Producten.
Black pepper prices recovered quickly in India, perhaps because of rather
pessimistic forecasts about the new crop. Prices in the other main producing
area rose in sympathy in spite of the relatively low demand during this past
week. Black pepper faq spot Europe traded yesterday at USDollars 2,625 a
tonne and for prompt shipment from origin at Dollars 2,575 cif. White pepper
prices in Indonesia went up further. Supplies are getting tighter but demand
was rather limited this week. Muntok white faq spot ended at Dollars 3,450 a
tonne.
