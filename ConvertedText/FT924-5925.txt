FT  24 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Dagenham Motors sees downturn


SHARES OF Dagenham Motors Group fell 25p to 78p after the Essex-based motor
distributor warned that second half profits were 'likely to fall short of
current market expectations'.
Mr David Philip, chairman, said makers' price cuts and the abolition of car
tax 'have had an immediate and severe impact on used vehicle values'.
Profits from the group's largest dealership at Dagenham had fallen following
the introduction of short time working and redundancies at the nearby Ford
plant, he added.
Nevertheless the final dividend should be held at 4p.
In September the group announced profits of Pounds 1.13m pre-tax for the six
months to June 30 on turnover of Pounds 75.6m. Profits for the 1991 year
amounted to Pounds 2.11m, achieved on turnover of Pounds 127.2m.
