FT  01 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: BT given no incentive


   From Mr TONY YOUNG


Sir, Of course - as Mr Ian Wheeler (Letters, November 29) indicates - BT
could fill its ducts full of optical fibre, but why should it do so?
What is the point of the company investing some Pounds 15bn in such a
broadband network when the current regulatory framework only allows it to
carry narrowband services on that network?
Britain needs a national information superhighway available virtually to all
homes and businesses in the country. However, local cable television
operators alone will never create such a ubiquitous network. BT - in
competition with many others - is prepared to make the national investment
if it is allowed to carry the full range of services that will generate the
revenues to justify that investment.
All it has at present is the government's promise of a review in 2001 of the
present regulatory constraint with no assurance that that constraint will be
lifted even then. The House of Commons select committee on trade and
industry provided an alternative scenario. The government should adopt it.
