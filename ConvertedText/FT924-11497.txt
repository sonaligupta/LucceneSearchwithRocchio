FT  26 OCT 92 / Midlands fear on single market


   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent


THE WEST Midlands, regarded as the manufacturing heart of the UK, is not
expected to benefit particularly from the European single market, scheduled
for January 1, according to the region's local authorities.
It is expected 'to have above-average vulnerability' to the single market,
yet will remain highly dependent on exports and its ability to compete with
other European Community regions, says a study prepared by the authorities
to help in the planning of land use into the next century.
The worry of the local authorities is that older manufacturing areas in the
Birmingham-Black Country conurbation and Staffordshire have too few skills
available. 'By 2000 it has been estimated that 70 per cent of all European
jobs will require brain rather than manual skills, yet levels of academic
and skill attainment are relatively low in the west Midlands,' the report
says.
Although the demand of companies for skilled employees has fallen since the
start of the recession, the local authorities say restructuring of the
regional economy will be hampered by skills shortages.
The restructuring will involve a continuing decline in manufacturing
employment. The decline, swift in the recession of the early 1980s, slower
during the economic upturn of the late 1980s, has gathered pace again over
the past two years. During the 1990s, manufacturing employment will decline
by 20 per cent - 141,000 jobs - the local authorities estimated.
However, employment in the services sector is likely to rise by 9.6 per
cent, but that is less than the expected national average of 11.8 per cent.
