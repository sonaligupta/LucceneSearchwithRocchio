FT  23 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Caverdale back in the black with Pounds
663,000


CAVERDALE Group, the motor retailing and industrial consumables group,
returned to profit in the first half of 1993 with all its companies making a
strong contribution.
Including a contribution from acquisitions of Pounds 7.86m, group turnover
increased to Pounds 21.6m against Pounds 4.77m, and operating profit came
out at Pounds 803,000, including acquisitions of Pounds 210,000, compared
with a loss of Pounds 170,000.
At the pre-tax level the profit was Pounds 663,000, compared with a loss of
Pounds 272,000 for the comparable period and a loss of Pounds 950,000 for
the whole of 1992.
Mr Arild Nerdrum, chairman, said Dunham & Haines, acquired in September
1992, achieved a rapid recovery and was making a significant contribution to
group profit.
There was a strong first-time contribution from Motobaldet, a Citroen
dealer, and improved profitability in industrial consumables.
Mr Nerdrum said that the company would soon technically be in a position to
resume dividends.
'In view of the results achieved and given the current indications of good
trading prospects in August for our motor dealerships, I have every
confidence that an early return to the dividend list is realistic'.
