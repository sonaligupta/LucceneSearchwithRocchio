FT  22 APR 93 / UK Company News: QMH sells Harmony stake


   By TIM BURT


QUEENS MOAT Houses, the hotel group, yesterday sold a 14.5 per cent stake in
Harmony Leisure, the pubs and restaurants company, to Southend Property
Holdings.
Southend, an existing minority shareholder in Harmony, said it made a bid
for the stake after shares in the hotel group were suspended last month.
Describing the transaction as a 'good opportunity', Mr Malcolm Dagul,
chairman of Southend, said the group had agreed to buy 3.88m Harmony shares
at 5p apiece. The sale is dependent on a planned rights issue at Harmony
being underwritten.
