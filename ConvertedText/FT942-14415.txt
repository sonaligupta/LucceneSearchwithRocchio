Honeywell, the US electronic control systems group, reported a drop in net
income and revenues for the first quarter as the company's space and
aviation controls business continued to decline.
Net income for the quarter was Dollars 47.7m, or 36 cents a share, in line
with expectations. For the same period last year, net income was Dollars
57.3m, or 42 cents.
Revenues for the quarter were down 6 per cent at Dollars 1.35bn, compared
with Dollars 1.44bn.
Sales of Honeywell's home and building controls unit increased to Dollars
576m, up 6 per cent from the first quarter of 1993.
Operating profit was Dollars 45.5m, up 10 per cent.
However, sales of industrial control products declined 5 per cent to Dollars
390.7m, reducing operating profits for that division to Dollars 39.7m, down
9 per cent. Excluding sales of a keyboard business, which was sold in July
1993, sales were flat.
The space and aviation control business reported operating profits of
Dollars 24.6m, down 36 per cent from the first quarter of last year. Sales
declined 21 per cent to Dollars 351m from Dollars 446.8m.
'Space and aviation results were in line with our expectations, and reflect
lower aircraft production rates and reduced government spending,' said Mr
Michael Bonsignore, Honeywell chairman and chief executive.
'We expect market conditions to remain challenging in the near term. We have
aggressively sized our business to meet these conditions, while maintaining
high levels of research and development investment in next-generation
avionics.'
Honeywell said that it had established a wholly-owned affiliate company
during the quarter based in Tianjin, China.
