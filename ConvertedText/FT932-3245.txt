FT  15 JUN 93 / UK Company News: East Midlands Elect lifts dividend 14%


   By MICHAEL SMITH


EAST MIDLANDS Electricity set the scene for high dividend rises among
regional electricity companies when yesterday it raised its distribution by
14 per cent.
Analysts had expected East Midlands, the first of the recs to announce
results for last year, to offer one of the lowest dividend rises.
'We might be looking at 14 per cent plus for all of them now,' said one.
For the year to March 31, East Midlands reported pre-tax profits up 3.4 per
cent at Pounds 155.1m on turnover ahead 1.7 per cent to Pounds 1.57bn.
The final dividend was 13.78p, making a total of 19.5p, paid from earnings
of 53.3p, up 6.4 per cent.
Mr John Harris, chairman, said this year's dividend did not mean that the
company would necessarily provide increases at the same level in future. He
saw no risk of being penalised by the regulator for the dividend rise.
'We have demonstrated we are one of the lowest-cost operators in the country
and we are reducing tariffs in real terms,' he said.
The City applauded East Midlands for its attack on costs. Mr Harris said the
restructuring of its core electricity business, which involves cutting
operating divisions from 13 to seven, would reduce operating costs by Pounds
10m a year when fully implemented.
Electricity supply and distribution made operating profits of Pounds 179.6m,
up 16 per cent. However, energy services incurred an operating loss of
Pounds 4.9m against a profit of Pounds 1.8m. Mr Harris admitted not all the
contracting businesses had performed as well as expected.
Mr Harris said retailing had a much improved second half but profits were
Pounds 200,000 for the year compared with Pounds 1.3m. He said there was a
chance of further alliances following a merger this year with Yorkshire's
retail operations.
