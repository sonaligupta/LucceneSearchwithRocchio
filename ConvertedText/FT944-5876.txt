FT  01 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Nu-Swift plans Pounds 6.5m property
injection for London Securities


   By DAVID WIGHTON


Nu-Swift, the fire protection and property group that was taken private in
March, is proposing to inject a Pounds 6.5m commercial property portfolio
into London Securities, taking its stake in the quoted shell company to 75
per cent.
Nu-Swift, which is controlled by Mr Jacques Murray, already has a 29 per
cent stake in London Securities.
London Securities is to pay Pounds 6.79m in new shares for a portfolio of
six commercial properties, valued at Pounds 17.6m by Jones Lang Wootton,
giving a net value of Pounds 6.2m after related debt of Pounds 11.2m.
Current rental income is about Pounds 1.8m a year. Nu-Swift will place some
of the shares it receives to limit its stake to 75 per cent.
London Securities' company voluntary arrangement with creditors entered in
October 1992, expired in October this year. Most of the group's assets have
been sold and the proceeds used to repay secured creditors.
The company made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 225,000 (Pounds 342,000) in the
year to September, representing the costs of operating the voluntary
arrangement. The company warned that its cash resources stand at about
Pounds 10,000 and would run out by the end of January if no action was
taken. The shares were suspended at 2 3/4p.
