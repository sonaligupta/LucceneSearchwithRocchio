FT  04 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: Credit Lyonnais voices
concern over derivatives image


   By CONNER MIDDELMANN


Amid the controversy surrounding funds investing in derivative instruments,
futures fund managers Credit Lyonnais Rouse (CLR) are voicing concern over
the industry's image.
'If we want to develop this business and get people to take the industry
seriously, we need the last two months like a hole in the head,' said Mr
David Moore, head of CLR's funds division.
Many funds investing aggressively in derivatives incurred heavy losses in
the currency and bond markets during the last two months, prompting a wave
of concern about the potentially destabilising effects of such investment
vehicles.
CLR recommends that the industry move away from basic managed futures
towards the construction of funds using derivatives (including futures,
options and swaps) that identify a particular risk or return profile and
identify their performance objectives.
Moreover, 'fees and expenses must be kept under control', they state.
Performance fees are acceptable if the performance element of the fee is
only charged after a minimum level of return has been achieved, they argue.
Indeed, 'negotiations with new CTAs (commodities trading advisers) for our
established funds have shown an acceptance of the critical idea of only
charging performance fees above a minimum level of return,' said Mr Moore.
'We are in the process of signing two CTAs on this basis.'
The industry average is currently a 2 per cent, management fee and an
additional performance fee ranging between 15 and 25 per cent.
