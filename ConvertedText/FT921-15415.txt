FT  10 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Citibank confirms Samba stake
sale


   By PATRICK HARVERSON


CITIBANK confirmed yesterday it sold a quarter of its 40 per cent stake in
Saudi American Bank (Samba) last month to two Saudi government-run pension
institutions.
The US banking group would not divulge how much money was raised by the sale
of the 10 per cent stake, but it said reports that Dollars 467m had changed
hands bore little resemblance to the truth.
The full details of the transaction will be included in Citibank's
fourth-quarter results and based on the current value of Samba shares, the
600,000 shares sold would have been worth about Dollars 336m.
Taking advantage of a sharp rise this year in Saudi share prices, the US
bank decided to sell part of its stake in Samba to boost its capital ratios
for the final quarter.
Troubled by huge doubtful real estate loans and massive operating losses,
Citibank has instituted a restructuring programme aimed at cutting costs and
bolstering its weak capital base.
The US bank said yesterday the sale would not undermine its long-term
commitment to Samba, and it would continue to provide the bank with
management expertise according to a longstanding agreement with its partners
in the joint venture.
Citibank's links with the Saudi kingdom, which go back to 1980 when it took
a 40 per cent stake in Samba as a joint venture with several Saudi
institutions, were strengthened a year ago when a prominent member of the
Saudi royal family, Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal bought Dollars 590m
convertible shares in Citicorp, the bank's parent group.
