FT  20 APR 94 / International Company News: Intel net income climbs to
Dollars 617m in record quarter


   By LOUISE KEHOE


Intel, the world's largest maker of computer chips, reported strong growth
in revenues and earnings for the first quarter, its seventh consecutive
quarter of record results.
Revenue for the quarter totalled Dollars 2.66bn, up from Dollars 2.02bn a
year ago. Net income was Dollars 617m, or Dollars 1.40 per share, compared
with Dollars 548m, or Dollars 1.24, in last year's first quarter.
Growth was driven by a 'steady migration of computer buyers toward higher
performance (personal computer) systems,' said Mr Andrew Grove, president
and chief executive. First-quarter orders set another company record, he
said.
Intel is the leading supplier of microprocessor chips to the personal
computer industry. Strong demand for personal computers, together with a
slight increase in the average price of microprocessors, is driving the
company's growth.
Intel is 'on the most aggressive processor (production) ramp in our history
in order to deliver Pentium processors in high volume for mass market PCs',
said Mr Grove.
The Pentium is Intel's latest and highest performance microprocessor.
The company aims to produce between 6m and 7m Pentium chips this year, with
Pentium sales expected to represent 25 per cent of fourth-quarter sales to
the PC industry, Intel said.
Of the first-quarter revenues, 51 per cent came from the Americas, 27 per
cent from Europe, 8 per cent from Japan and 14 per cent from the
Asia-Pacific region.
The company said its latest fiscal quarter included an extra week to bring
end-of-quarter dates more in line with the calendar dates. The extra week
had an immaterial effect on first quarter revenue.
