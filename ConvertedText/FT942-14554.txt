FT  20 APR 94 / Ulster peace 'within a year'


   By MICHAEL CASSELL


There could be an end to terrorist violence in Northern Ireland within a
year, Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, predicted
yesterday.
Mr Molyneaux, speaking in Washington, added to a series of upbeat
predictions about an end to terrorism made by politicians and security
forces in the province since the IRA's three-day ceasefire two weeks ago.
In a particularly optimistic forecast which caused some surprise in Ulster
last night, Mr Molyneaux said he believed violence would begin to decline.
He said: 'If you ask me where we will be this time next year, I stick my
neck out and say . . . we are going to see the ice breaking up even more, we
are going to see an end to violence as far as the main forces are
concerned.'
Mr Molyneaux did not rule out 'the occasional Mafia-type operation' but said
that once terrorism was over the 'united community in Northern Ireland -
Protestant, Catholic, no religion at all - will sit very firmly on anyone
who seeks to disturb the settlements which are now beginning'.
Sir Hugh Annesley, Ulster's chief constable, has in recent weeks privately
suggested that violence could end within three years. Last weekend, Dr John
Alderdice, leader of the Alliance party, predicted peace in the province by
the end of this decade.
