FT  23 APR 93 / Volvo set for talks with Daf


   By KEVIN DONE


VOLVO, the Swedish truck maker, is expected to discuss with the Leyland Daf
administrative receivers today the future of the truck operations at
Leyland, Lancashire, Kevin Done writes.
The frontrunner to take over the Leyland Daf truck business, which collapsed
into administrative receivership in February together with the rest of the
Daf group, has hitherto been a management buy-out team led by Mr John
Gilchrist, managing director.
The buy-out team began formal talks with the administrative receivers last
week, when it said a number of funding offers had been received from leading
financial institutions.
The receivers are, however, in contact with several other potentially
interested parties. As well as Volvo they are also known to have held talks
with Paccar, the US truck maker which owns Foden, the specialist UK heavy
truck producer based in Sandbach, Cheshire.
