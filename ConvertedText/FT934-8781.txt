FT  13 NOV 93 / International Company News: Anglo-Swedish steelmaker drops
into loss

AVESTA Sheffield, the Anglo-Swedish stainless steel producer, slipped into a
SKr105m (Dollars 13m) loss after financial items for the first nine months
of 1993, after failing to sustain an improving results trend in the third
quarter.
The group blamed holiday production stoppages for a third-quarter deficit of
SKr61m, which followed a second-quarter profit of SKr9m. It did not provide
comparative figures because the company was only formed through a merger
between Avesta and British Steel Stainless last November. The deal left
British Steel with a 40 per cent stake in Avesta Sheffield.
The short-term market outlook remains very uncertain, the group warned, not
least because of the volatile nickel price and weaker European prices for
cold rolled products.
However, it is still predicting a better result for the full year than last
year's SKr564m loss due to cost-reductions and the weaker Swedish and UK
currencies. Sales amounted to SKr10.66bn for the nine months. The group's
biggest division, cold rolled sheet and plate, made a SKr158m operating
profit on sales of SKr5.38bn.
It was helped by higher exports to the US and Asia Pacific which offset the
downturn in demand in Europe.
