FT  02 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: Pechiney loan oversubscribed


   By ANTONIA SHARPE


A LARGE syndicated loan for Pechiney, the state-controlled French aluminium
group which is earmarked for privatisation, has been oversubscribed,
reflecting the dearth of quality corporate borrowers looking to raise funds
in this market.
The lack of borrower demand for syndicated loans this year has resulted in a
considerable erosion in margins as banks compete more aggressively for new
loans business.
Pechiney was looking to raise Dollars 800m, but bankers involved in the deal
said that more than Dollars 1bn had been raised during the course of
syndication. The borrower is expected to take a decision in the next few
days on whether to increase the loan.
The loan, jointly arranged by Barclays Bank, BNP, Societe Generale and CS
First Boston, will be divided into two tranches. One tranche of Dollars 400m
will have a relatively long maturity of seven years, while the other Dollars
400m tranche will have a life of five years.
Pechiney, which is unrated but is perceived by the market as a single A
credit, is paying an interest margin of 55 basis points over Libor for the
first five years, on both tranches. The spread over Libor will rise to 60
basis points for the final two years of the loan.
The commitment fee is 27 1/2 basis points for the first five years, rising
to 30 basis points in the last two years. The participation fee is 17 1/2
basis points on Dollars 40m for lead managers and 12 1/2 basis points on
Dollars 20m for managers.
