FT  07 JAN 94 / Big increase in DTI probes


   By ANDREW JACK


The number of company investigations begun by the Department of Trade and
Industry nearly doubled - to 79 - in the third quarter of 1993 compared with
the quarter before, official figures released yesterday show.
Requests for investigations rose to 255 during the quarter, reaching a total
of 1,107 for the year to September 30 compared with 876 in the previous 12
months.
The proportion of requests for investigations that were rejected was almost
unchanged at 78 per cent compared with 79 per cent last year.
Two-thirds of the requests came from members of the public, 21 per cent from
other divisions of within the DTI, 9 per cent from other regulators and only
3 per cent from the police or the director of public prosecutions.
In the third quarter, 53 investigations were completed compared with 45 in
the second quarter of the year.
Seven defendants were convicted in criminal proceedings and three of them
received custodial sentences.
The convictions were for offences including fraudulent trading, theft,
forgery and conducting unauthorised investment business.
There were 18 winding-up orders granted by the courts during investigations
carried out by DTI officials.
In addition, there were 44 criminal convictions in response to reports from
official receivers on the affairs of insolvent companies and debtors.
During the year the department was involved in six cases of providing
assistance to overseas regulators in the pursuit of cross-border fraud.
The number of confidential investigations begun by the department was 228 in
the year to September 30 compared with 164 in the previous 12 months. The
number completed was 197 compared with 167.
