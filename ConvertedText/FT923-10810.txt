FT  28 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets: Mexico


   By DAMIAN FRASER


Mexico continued its down-ward path, a closing fall of 56 points, or 3.7 per
cent, to 1,466.62 extending the drop since June 1 to some 20 per cent,
writes Damian Fraser.
Telmex L shares lost 2.6 per cent ahead of this week's results. Alfa
weakened 3.8 per cent on reporting a 53 per cent drop in first-half profits.
The market has been hurt by revelations that stockbrokers lost around
Dollars 500m in May and June as higher interest rates eroded the value of
government bonds they had bought.
