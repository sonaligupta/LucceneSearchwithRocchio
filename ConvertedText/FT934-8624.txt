FT  15 NOV 93 / US judge lifts curb on TV networks

A LOS ANGELES judge has cleared the way for big changes in the financing of
the US television industry by lifting a long-standing ban on the three large
TV networks - ABC, CBS and NBC - owning a financial interest in most of the
programmes they broadcast.
The ruling by Judge Manuel Real, awaited for over a year, was made known to
Hollywood film industry executives late on Friday.
It will mean tough new competition from the networks for the large Hollywood
film studios, which provide most of the prime-time television programming.
It could also encourage mergers between the TV networks and the film
studios.
The court ban, imposed on anti-trust grounds, was one of two obstacles
preventing the networks having a financial involvement in prime time
programmes. The other was the so-called financial interest and syndication
rule, imposed more than 20 years ago by the Federal Communications
Commission, when the three networks controlled more than 90 per cent of the
television market.
With the three networks now accounting for only 60 per cent of the market,
the FCC lifted its ban in April.
