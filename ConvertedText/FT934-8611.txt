FT  15 NOV 93 / Labour warns on forest sell-off


FOREST privatisation would be an act of folly that could cost thousands of
jobs, Labour said yesterday.
Mr Gavin Strang, shadow agriculture minister, served notice that the party
would step up its campaign over the next few months to convince the
government to abandon 'the dogma of privatisation and to retain our state
forests for the nation'.
He said in a statement that multi-national companies with paper and pulp
mills in the UK had warned the government that a sell-off would jeopardise
the security of their supplies.
'Timber-processsing companies plan to invest millions of pounds in this
country over the next few years. The industry has warned the government that
this investment will go overseas if the Forestry Commission is sold off.
Certainly, hundreds and probably thousands of jobs will be lost,' he said.
