COMINCO, the Canadian mining, metals and fertilisers group, posted a loss of
CDollars 36.8m (USDollars 29.2m), or 47 cents a share, for the first quarter
because of poor prices.
This compared with a loss of CDollars 4.9m, or 7 cents, in the
correspondingquar-ter of 1992. Sales were CDollars 291.5m, against CDollars
329m a year earlier.
The lower Canadian dollar only partly offset sharply lower base metal
prices, Cominco said. Mining and integrated metals operations showed an
operating loss of CDollars 22.2m, compared with an operating profit of
CDollars 6m, on sales of CDollars 227m, against CDollars 256m.
The Red Dog mine in Alaska continued to show losses, as did the Sullivan
mine and Trail smelting operations in British Columbia.
Fertiliser profits slipped to CDollars 5.9m, and sales were lower because of
poor weather in the US market.
The Quebrada copper project in northern Chile is now in full construction
with a workforce of 2,000 at the site. Inco is responding to lower nickel
prices by driving costs down further and may cut back production again later
this year, Mr Michael Sopko, chairman, told the annual meeting in Toronto.
'Russian nickel exports overhang the market like a cloud,' he said.
Inco is looking to offshore laterite deposits for future expansion, because
they can be mined by open-pit methods and show lower costs.
Stelco, Canada's second-biggest steelmaker, lost CDollars 38m, or 51 cents a
share,in the first quarter, against a loss of CDollars 32m, or 45 cents, a
year earlier. Sales were little changed at CDollars 575m.
Rio Algom's first-quarter profit jumped 43 per cent to CDollars 7m, or 15
cents a share, on revenues of CDollars 258m, up 8 per cent. The gain came
from growth in metals distribution.
