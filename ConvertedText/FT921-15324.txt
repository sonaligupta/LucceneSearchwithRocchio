FT  10 JAN 92 / A muffin on wheels: Honda's US credentials are under attack


   By MARTIN DICKSON


It sounds as American as a blueberry muffin and almost as down-home and
wholesome: 'The amazing new car from Ohio,' runs the advertising slogan,
'that goes around corners, up hills and overseas.'
The car in question is an estate model of the Accord, America's top-selling
car, which is assembled in Marysville, Ohio, by the Japanese company, Honda.
Since the launch of the estate version just over a year ago, Honda has been
using this patriotic sales pitch in an attempt to woo the American public,
saying the wagon is the first Japanese car entirely designed and built in
the US. It is also the first Honda vehicle exported from the US to Europe,
and some of the cars have even been sold to Japan.
The implication is that Honda is a thoroughly admirable US corporate
citizen, busily creating American jobs. It has certainly gained that
reputation in the decade since it became the first Japanese car company to
set up a manufacturing plant (a so-called 'transplant') in the US, back in
1982. It has invested Dollars 2.2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) in the country and now
employs 10,000 people. It says that 65 per cent of its vehicles sold in the
US are manufactured in north America and that these have a 75 per cent local
content.
This benign image is under attack, with US car parts manufacturers claiming
that the domestic content of Honda's cars may be far less than the Japanese
company maintains.
The issue of car trade between Japan and the US has been brought to
prominence this week by the presence of leaders of the US auto industry  -
including the chairmen of the Big Three motor manufacturers, GM, Ford and
Chrysler - on President George Bush's trip to Japan. A crucial feature of
the visit was the president's attempts to persuade the Japanese to buy more
US parts and finished vehicles. In Washington, congressional Democrats have
been pressing for tougher trade legislation against Tokyo, particularly to
restrict US sales of Japanese vehicles. Japanese manufacturers now account
for some 31 per cent of the US car market.
This advance has important implications for US-Japan trade relations. The
auto parts industry is the largest manufacturing sector in the US, with 1990
sales of more than Dollars 100bn, and the automobile sector accounts for
three-quarters of America's Dollars 41bn trade deficit with Japan.
With the US in recession and a presidential election fast approaching,
political pressures are mounting for action on the deficit, particularly the
automotive component of it.
In spite of all the huffing and puffing in Washington, the American public
has an increasing taste for Japanese cars and suspects that many of the US
motor industry's problems, at home and in Japan, are of its own making.
This explains the ferocity with which the US auto parts manufacturers have
turned their propaganda guns on Honda's US operations. If this 'transplant'
pioneer can be shown to be less American than it seems, the case for
restrictive legislation will be that much stronger.
Honda is under fire on two fronts. The first involves a study by the
University of Michigan, paid for by a lobbying body for the US auto parts
industry. The study examined a 1989 Honda Accord assembled in the US and
found that imports from Japan accounted for 38 per cent of the value of its
parts, while a further 46 per cent was from Japanese suppliers which had set
up plants in the US. A mere 16 per cent of the parts came from US-owned
suppliers.
Honda disputes the figures - although it pleads commercial confidentiality
in refusing to give its own - and says that, in any case, they are out of
date and that its domestic content has increased 'substantially' since 1989.
The second controversy concerns the company's manufacture of small Civic
cars at a plant in Canada, using some parts shipped from the US. Many of the
finished vehicles are then exported to the US and, under the terms of the
US-Canada free-trade agreement, must have a 50 per cent north American
content to qualify for duty-free entry.
However, a preliminary audit by US customs officials apparently estimated
that less than 40 per cent of the car was north American and that the
company owed Dollars 20m in duties.
Again, Honda strongly denies the allegation and points out that the US
customs department has yet to lay down formal regulations as to just what
constitutes north American content. The Treasury in Washington, to which the
customs officials report, will only say that the audit is incomplete,
involves 'vastly complicated' legal and political issues, and will not be
finished until February.
Customs regulations apart, there is no requirement - other than political
expediency - for Honda or any other Japanese automobile manufacturer with US
transplants to buy a specific quantity of parts from local suppliers. Nor is
there any requirement that these suppliers be US-owned companies rather than
Japanese parts transplants, more than 300 of which have followed the
automobile assemblers to the US.
However, American critics charge that the assemblers and parts transplants
have simply brought with them the Japanese keiretsu system, involving
extended families of companies linked by cross-shareholders, directorships
and business relationships. It is alleged that assemblers such as Honda,
Toyota and Nissan set the prices for captive Japanese suppliers, some of
which may be dumping parts in the US.
The most vocal accusers also suggest - although they produce no clear
figures to support the allegation - that many of the transplant parts
factories may be relying heavily on parts which are essentially manufactured
in Japan but can be claimed as American by labelling, painting or testing
them in the US.
But a Honda spokesman dismisses the claim as 'political, and made by people
who have never been in manufacturing'. He also points out that Honda is the
only car manufacturer to make small engines for its vehicles in the US,
since even Detroit's Big Three companies now import theirs from Asia.
Nor has Honda been immune from the US recession: the group yesterday
forecast a 17 per cent drop in annual net income, owing to declining demand
in the US and Japan.
Other Japanese companies suggest that many US companies have been unable to
compete on grounds of cost and quality. But Mr Jack Reilly, chief executive
of Tenneco Automotive, a leading US parts maker, and chairman of the parts
committee which commissioned the Honda study, disputes this and says
sarcastically: 'It is incredibly difficult to believe that the world's
largest parts supply base is competitive on cost and quality only on 16 per
cent of the transplant business.'
Whatever the truth, Mr Richard Gephardt, the Democratic House majority
leader, and Democratic congressmen from the automobile manufacturing state
of Michigan, announced just before Christmas that tough new legislation
would be introduced.
The bill would lower the ceiling on Japanese car sales over a five-year
period if Tokyo did not reduce its trade deficit with the US by 20 per cent
a year. The bill also contains provisions designed to push the Japanese
companies into using a much higher proportion of US components in their
vehicles. Mr Gephardt and others complain that while Japanese parts are
flooding the US market, the Japanese market remains virtually shut to
American parts makers, thanks to the keiretsus and the Japanese distribution
system.
But the prospects for the bill are uncertain, not least because the
administration opposes it. The White House argues that negotiation rather
than legislative mandate is the way to solve the trade imbalance.
The Japanese are concerned about the backlash, as demonstrated by their
announcement this week of plans to increase substantially their purchases of
foreign-made parts and cars. But the figures still fall well short of US
demands and will take years to achieve, not least because it is difficult to
change parts suppliers until new vehicle models are introduced. So the US
industry's Japan-bashing is not about to stop.
However, the US position might be stronger if the various departments of the
federal government could agree on what constitutes an 'American' car. For
while customs officers are questioning the provenance of Honda's Canadian
models, other US trade officials have been challenging French claims that
those Accord wagons exported to the European Community from Ohio should be
classified as Japanese vehicles.
Not so, says Washington; they are as American as blueberry muffins.
