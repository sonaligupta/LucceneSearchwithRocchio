FT  29 APR 94 / UK Company News: Redrow scales down flotation proposals


   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent


The recent decline in housebuilding shares yesterday persuaded Redrow, the
third housebuilder to come to the market this year, to scale down its
flotation plans.
The company announced that 87m shares would be sold at 135p apiece, raising
a total of Pounds 117m and giving a market capitalisation of Pounds 298m.
At the beginning of March issue proposals were expected to place a value of
Pounds 350m on the company.
Redrow is raising Pounds 55.4m from the sale of 41m shares while Mr Steve
Morgan, the founder and chief executive, is raising Pounds 62m from the sale
of 46m shares, reducing his stake to 60 per cent.
Mr Morgan had planned to raise Pounds 100m, reducing his stake to about 50
per cent, but decided to reduce the size of the sale following the recent
decline in building shares.
Up to 35 per cent of the shares will be sold to the public with the
remainder placed with institutions.
The issue price puts the shares on a prospective p/e of 17.1 on forecast
pre-tax profits of Pounds 21m for the year to June 30.
The notional gross yield on a forecast total dividend of 2.7p is 2.5 per
cent.
Barclays de Zoete Wedd has fully underwritten the offer with Cazenove acting
as broker.
Applications close at midday on May 9 with dealings due to start on May 17.
Mr Morgan said that proceeds from the issue would be used to repay group
borrowings of Pounds 25m and to finance land purchases.
COMMENT
Redrow is the pick of the housebuilders to float this year. It follows
Beazer Homes and Wainhomes, both of which have recently been trading below
their issue prices as construction shares have underperformed the FT-SE-A
All-Share Index by 8 per cent since the end of February. Earlier in the year
Redrow had been looking at price of about 145p but has carefully pitched the
issue to stand at a small discount to class acts in the sector like Wilson
Bowden and Berkeley. Redrow does not look out of place in this company and
the shares deserve to open at a small premium.
