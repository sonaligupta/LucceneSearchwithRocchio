FT  03 SEP 93 / International Company News: Cost controls help Sasol to 14%
profits increase

SASOL, the South African synthetic fuel and chemicals group, out-performed
stock market expectations in the year ended June, lifting net attributable
profits by 14.4 per cent, to R1.3bn (Dollars 386m), and paying a higher
dividend.
Higher volumes and currency depreciation helped raise turnover 5 per cent to
R8.25bn, despite mostly weaker selling prices.
Pre-tax profits rose 19.9 per cent to R1.84bn, reflecting reduced interest
charges of R122m - against R228.6m - and stringent cost control.
The company, which estimates a modest improvement in earnings for the
current year, is stepping up its dividend from 78 cents a share to 86 cents.
Costs rose by only 3.5 per cent, well below the inflation rate. This was
largely due to a 15 per cent cut in staff numbers. Mr Joe Stegmann,
chairman, said the cost performance went well beyond normal belt-tightening.
The increase in attributable earnings includes provision for R100m to be
transferred to a tax equalisation fund. This is in anticipation of a jump in
the group's tax rate, to more than 30 per cent next year from less than 20
per cent this year as various tax allowances lapse.
A divisional breakdown of group profits shows that 41 per cent came from
synthetic fuels, 22 per cent from coal, 25 per cent from crude oil refining,
fuels marketing and gas, and 12 per cent from petrochemicals, fertilisers,
explosives and polymers.
The good parts of the group's performance had been higher sales volumes and
better profits from coal and fuels marketing. These were counteracted by
lower refining margins and severely depressed chemicals prices.
Mr Kruger said the proposed joint venture with AECI's plastics and
chlor-alkali business would go ahead subject to competition board approval.
