FT  26 MAY 93 / UK Company News: RTZ arranges second enhanced scrip dividend


   By ANGUS FOSTER


RTZ Corporation, the mining group, yesterday became the first company to
announce that it had arranged a second enhanced scrip dividend, which will
be offered on the company's interim dividend for this year.
The company, which had already used the enhanced scrip scheme for its final
dividend last year, is also bringing forward payment of the interim from
December to August. To take full benefit of the scheme the size of the
interim and final dividends will be reversed.
RTZ yesterday declared an interim of 13.5p with an enhanced scrip
alternative of 20.25p. BZW, which designed the enhanced scrip scheme, will
make a separate cash offer at 98 per cent of the enhanced scrip's value,
equal to 19.85p.
In previous cases, BZW made a 95 per cent cash offer, but then faced
competition from Swiss Bank Corporation, which offered 98 per cent on
schemes arranged for BAT, Redland and BICC.
Assuming a 90 per cent take up of the issue, as achieved last time, RTZ will
eliminate Pounds 33m of unrelieved advance corporation tax and will have
substantially cleared its unrelieved ACT problem.
