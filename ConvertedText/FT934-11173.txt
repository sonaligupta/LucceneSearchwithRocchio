FT  02 NOV 93 / Observer: Stationary


More klaxons wailing in the long-running offensive between Northumbria
Ambulance Service's chief executive Laurie Caple and his critics.
Labour MPs from the north-east, bitterly opposed to Caple's management style
and his enthusiasm for commercial income-generation schemes, have tabled an
early day motion drawing attention to the latest in a series of tussles over
subjects ranging from employees' conditions and dismissals, to the auditing
of NAS accounts and the purchase of personalised NAS number-plates.
It transpires that the Pounds 70,000 American-made Chevrolet ambulances
ordered by NAS do not fit into some of its more modestly proportioned
garages.
'There's an element of farce about it all, but it clearly calls into
judgment the competence of the original decision to buy the vehicles,' says
Newcastle Central MP Jim Cousins.
But NAS will have none of it. We've only ordered six, it says, and they will
happily fit into 19 of the 24 garages.
Observer just hopes that the right ambulance will be in the right garage at
the right time.
