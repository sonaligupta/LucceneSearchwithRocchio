FT  19 APR 94 / Lord Scott will resist restrictions on Iraq enquiry


   By JIMMY BURNS


Lord Justice Scott has told Whitehall officials that he will resist any
attempt by the government to place unjustified restrictions on his
arms-for-Iraq inquiry, Jimmy Burns writes.
The judge told a meeting of officials last week that he was determined 'to
make available to the public as much information' as he could in his report,
which is due to be published before the end of the year.
The judge states in a memorandum for the meeting: 'This inquiry was
established because of public concern about the way in which government
policy operated in relation to defence and defence-related sales to Iraq. It
would be impossible to allay public concern if material were unnecessarily
withheld.'
The judge will halt publication of the whole or parts of a document only if
he feels public disclosure might cause 'serious injury to the interests of
the nation', might create a serious risk of harm to an individual or if
there was a risk of serious prejudice to legal proceedings.
He intends to seek written evidence from ministers and officials. He also
plans to ask permanent secretaries to comment on the performance of their
departments.
The government has been encouraging officials and ministers to co-operate
with the probe. But an official said last night the judge's procedures for
publishing the report would need to be discussed.
