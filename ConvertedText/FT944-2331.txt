FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Rejuvenated balance sheet behind recovery
at YJ Lovell


   By JAMES WHITTINGTON


Shares in YJ Lovell (Holdings) gained 7p to 60p yesterday after news that
its financial restructuring had returned the builder and property developer
to the black.
The turnround from losses of Pounds 59.6m to a pre-tax profit of Pounds
4.16m for the year to September was achieved on the back of a rejuvenated
balance sheet, which strengthened from a net liability position of Pounds
13.3m to show net assets of Pounds 62.2m.
The first dividend for three years is declared at 1p, on earnings per share
rose of 9.4p (712.3p restated loss).
Growth in all of the core businesses of construction, residential housing
and plant hire helped lift sales to Pounds 251m (Pounds 224m).
The restructuring package, agreed with a syndicate of banks last December,
injected Pounds 75.5m into the balance sheet through a Pounds 45.8m
debt-to-equity swap and a Pounds 29.7m rights issue.
The money was used in a substantial write-down of property and land in the
US and the UK's commercial property divisions and residential housing in
Spain. There was also fresh capital investment in the Plant Hire company -
which enjoyed windfall profits of Pounds 800,000 against a Pounds 1.7m loss
 -and in the residential business in the US and UK.
Group net debt was reduced from Pounds 94.2m to Pounds 25.5m, resulting in
on balance sheet gearing of 41 per cent.
Mr Bob Sellier, chief executive, said: 'Our order books are looking healthy
and we will continue to consolidate or discontinue our weaker businesses.'
The only area where profits fell was the Partnership division, which
provides social housing in conjunction with the UK's Housing Association.
Pre-tax profits fell 17 per cent to Pounds 2.9m, due to reduced sales and
government funding for social housing, said Mr Sellier.
