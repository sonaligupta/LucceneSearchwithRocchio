FT  20 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy turnover in Clyde


   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY


Clyde Petroleum was the most heavily traded stock in the London market as
one broker sold 30m shares, equivalent to 7.5 per cent of the company.
The sale was carried out by Clyde's broker, Hoare Govett, and the shares
were taken on at 33p to be placed at 33 1/2 p. After the market closed, it
was announced that George Weston Holdings - the private investment company
of Mr Garry Weston, the chairman of Associated British Foods - had reduced
its stake to 6.86 per cent. The investment group bought a 15.8 per cent
stake from TMOC, the Australian oil company in 1987.
The sale comes just days after US fund management group Fidelity sold 13m
shares, or 3.4 per cent. Clyde's underlying share price held steady at 36p
with final turnover for the day recorded at 58m shares.
