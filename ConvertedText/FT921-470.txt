FT  28 MAR 92 / Greece in talks with Macedonia


   By KERIN HOPE


   ATHENS


Greece has started unofficial talks with Macedonia in an attempt to resolve
a dispute over the name of the breakaway Yugoslavia republic, writes Kerin
Hope in Athens.
Officials said US President George Bush had agreed to a request from Mr
Constantine Mitsotakis, the Greek prime minister, to postpone recognition of
Macedonia but on condition that the Greeks opened direct talks on the issue.
Mr Mitsotakis is understood to have told the US president in a telephone
conversation that his conservative government, with only a two-seat majority
in parliament, could be toppled over the Macedonian question. Greece claims
that Macedonia has territorial designs on the northern Greek province of the
same name.
