FT  12 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: BTR


The question of whether BTR deserves its below average rating will not be
easily resolved by yesterday's 3 per cent slip in pre-tax profits. The good
news is that there were no nasty surprises in the 1991 figures, while, if
anything, the case for buying the shares as a cyclical recovery stock has
been enhanced. Not only are costs being extracted in BTR's ferociously
efficient way - 10 per cent of the workforce last year, excluding Hawker
Siddeley, after a 7 per cent cut in employee numbers in 1990. The company is
now talking for the first time about a pick-up in the US and, more
guardedly, Australia.
A lot depends, though, on how quickly action on Hawker will translate into
higher margins. Any pressures on the profit and loss account will certainly
be relieved by the Pounds 250m-Pounds 300m of provisions already taken, and
by the Pounds 50m or so which might be added in the current year once
Hawker's long-term contracts have been given a careful going over.
BTR's utilisation record cannot be faulted; the worry is that at least half
of the provisions could involve cash outlay rather than asset write-downs.
Gearing may therefore fall more slowly than it did after BTR's previous
mouthfuls. Along with the inconsistent dividend signals and lack of
strategic clarity, that may keep the bulls in check a while yet.
