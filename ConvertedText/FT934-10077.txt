FT  08 NOV 93 / Serbs release UN hostages in Bosnia

THREE Swedish UN soldiers were released yesterday after being taken hostage
by Serb forces at a village in central Bosnia.
Clashes between Moslem and Croat forces were reported to have escalated
after UN commanders successfully negotiated the release of the soldiers, who
were seized south-east of Vares, the town which fell to the mainly Moslem
Bosnian army forces last week.
Major Hakan Birgir, company commander of the Nordic battalion, said the
three soldiers were released unharmed after being seized at Dastansko, near
Vares. It was not immediately clear why the Serb soldiers abducted the UN
soldiers or how their release was negotiated.
The entire group of some 30 UN soldiers was said to have had difficulty
extricating itself from the village after setting out to help about 500
Croats hiding from surrounding Moslem soldiers.
About 15,000 Croats last week fled the region after Moslem troops gained
ground against their Croat adversaries. Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic
yesterday appealed to the Croats to return to their homes in Vares, now
controlled by the mainly Moslem Bosnian army, according to Sarajevo radio.
Meanwhile, Mr Haris Silajdzic, Bosnia's prime minister, yesterday criticised
the UN for failing to protect the Moslem enclaves designated six months as
international 'safe areas'.
UN officials say Serb forces have stepped up their attacks on the eastern
towns of Gorazde and Srebrenica, two of six UN 'safe areas'. Serb forces
still block materials needed to provide shelter for refugees.
