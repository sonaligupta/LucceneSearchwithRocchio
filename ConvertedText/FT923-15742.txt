FT  01 JUL 92 / Hizbollah backs poll


   By REUTER


   BEIRUT


Shia Moslem fundamentalists took an important step towards the mainstream of
politics yesterday when Hizbollah (Party of God) announced it would take
part in Lebanon's first post-civil war general election, Reuter reports from
Beirut.
Syrian-backed President Elias Hrawi hopes to hold the vote within three
months, although Christian hardliners are pressing for delay. Mr Samir
Geagea, chief of the rightwing Christian Lebanese Forces (LF), declared
yesterday his group would boycott the vote if it were held too soon. The
general election will be the first since 1972.
