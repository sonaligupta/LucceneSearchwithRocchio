FT  25 AUG 92 / International Company News: Australian coal mining group

COAL & Allied, the Australian coal mining company, yesterday said net
profits fell by ADollars 10m to ADollars 49m (USDollars 35m) in the year to
end-June, on turnover down 4.3 per cent to ADollars 615m.
The group, 38 per cent owned by CRA, the Australian mining group, said it
expected a flat profit performance over the next 18 months, but forecast an
increase in Asian demand after 1994.
Mr Tony Haraldson, chief executive, said South Korea, Taiwan and Japan were
experiencing high growth in power demand, and would need to increase
generating capacity.
In line with the optimistic long-term outlook, Coal & Allied maintained the
final dividend at 35 cents, making a fully franked total of 60 cents for the
year, unchanged from the previous year.
Production increased to a record 11m tonnes from 10.5m tonnes in the
previous year, but sales fell slightly to 11.1m tonnes from 11.5m tonnes.
Coal & Allied shares closed unchanged at ADollars 9.39 on the Australian
Stock Exchange. CRA closed 30 cents lower at ADollars 12.50.
Amcor, the Australian packaging group, yesterday said it would pay ADollars
273m (USDollars 196m) for Leigh Mardon, a packaging, communications and
printing company with operations in Australia, Singapore and Hong Kong.
Leigh Mardon was sold by Coca-Cola Amatil for ADollars 260m two years ago to
a consortium of senior managers and financial institutions led by SBC
Dominguez Barry Capital Partners.
Amcor said it would finance the acquisition largely from its cash reserve of
about ADollars 200m, which includes ADollars 177m from the sale in July of
its 8.5 per cent shareholding in Mayne Nickless, the Australian transport
and distribution group.
Mr Stan Wallis, Amcor managing director, said Leigh Mardon's forecast sales
of nearly ADollars 300m this year would shore up the group's 'strong flow of
earnings' in Australia.
