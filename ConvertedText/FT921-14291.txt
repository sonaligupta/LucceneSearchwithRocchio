FT  16 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Drug approval buoys SB


   By DANIEL GREEN


SMITHKLINE BEECHAM has received approval for the first vaccine against
hepatitis-A, a disease usually contracted though contaminated food and
water.
The drug, Havrix, was approved in Switzerland at the end of December, but
the news was not published until yesterday. Its price will be revealed on
January 27.
Investors were caught by surprise by the approval and the company's shares
rose 18p to 963p, having been another 15p higher than that during the day.
Between 3,000 and 6,000 hepatitis-A cases are reported in the UK each year,
but the figure is much higher in developing countries. Hepatitis A causes
fever, jaundice and occasionally liver disease.
Mr Paul Woodhouse of stockbroker Smith New Court estimated that the drug
could make sales of up to Pounds 75m a year.
