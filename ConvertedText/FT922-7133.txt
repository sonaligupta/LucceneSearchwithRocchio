FT  20 MAY 92 / International Company News: Credit Suisse heads Swiss
foreign bond managers' league


   By IAN RODGER


   ZURICH


THE SWISS franc foreign bond market was surprisingly resilient last year,
considering the background of a weakening franc, rising interest rates and
dreary Japanese equity trends.
The value of the market dropped only 11.4 per cent to SFr28.8bn (USDollars
19.7m), and the Japanese share actually rose slightly from SFr12.1bn to
SFr12.9bn.
Equity related issues - convertible bonds and warrant bonds - accounted for
37 per cent of the value of all issues, up from 34 per cent in 1990, and
Japanese issuers were responsible for more than 99 per cent of them.
The league table of lead managers shifted slightly, with Credit Suisse
displacing Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) at the head.
It was expected that the dominance of the big three Swiss banks would
decline after the issue of banking licences to Japanese securities houses in
1988, but their combined share of 61.2 per cent last year was only 2 per
cent less than in 1990.
No Japanese house has yet taken away a lead management position from a Swiss
bank for a repeat Japanese borrower although that milestone has been
anticipated for months.
Things have been moving more rapidly in the equity-linked table, with
Japanese firms taking three of the top five places in the period up to
mid-May this year, compared with only two last year.
Market specialists agree that the introduction of conversion price
adjustments on equity related issues - an innovation attributed to Yamaichi
Bank (Switzerland) - has helped move these issues in a year when Japanese
equity prices were plunging.
The feature enables the conversion or exercise price to be reduced by up to
20 per cent several months before the conversion date.
