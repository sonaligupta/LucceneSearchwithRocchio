FT  07 JAN 94 / New cuts to Department of Health


The prospect of staff reductions in the Department of Health was raised
yesterday by a review set up by Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health
secretary.
Mrs Bottomley has already announced proposals to abolish regional health
authorities and streamline the Leeds-based National Health Service
management executive.
The new review will cover the Department of Health itself, and is likely to
put the future of some senior posts at risk.
Mrs Terri Banks, who was registrar-general until 1990 and is a former
director of health authority finance on the NHS management executive, will
conduct the inquiry, which is due to report by May.
She has been asked to take account of 'the importance of reducing running
costs as far as possible while maintaining an effective service to
ministers'.
