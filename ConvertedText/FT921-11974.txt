FT  29 JAN 92 / Appointments: Parker to Costain Coal


Costain, the UK construction engineering and mining group which saw its
share price fall steeply for much of last year, has moved to strengthen the
management of its important US coal mining business by appointing Tom Parker
as president and chief executive of Costain Coal Inc.
Parker, 48, who has previously worked for Consolidation Coal, Shell Oil and
Conoco in the US, replaces Gordon Haworth, 58, who leaves the company by
mutual consent.
According to Peter Costain, chief executive of the UK group: 'Gordon Haworth
had just two years of his service contract to serve and it was thought that
now would be the right time to replace him with a younger man with a long
term commitment to improve returns in the US coal business - which we are
determined to achieve.'
Coal sales from the US and Australia accounted for 62 per cent of Costain's
1990 operating profit.
