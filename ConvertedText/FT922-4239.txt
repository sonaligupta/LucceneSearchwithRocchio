FT  06 JUN 92 / Finance and the Family: At a glance - Endowments investment
trust


Kleinwort Benson Investment Management is to launch a novel investment trust
aimed at raising about Pounds 30m. Some technical details have still to
decided, but it is certain that the trust will be the first to invest solely
in second-hand unmatured endowment policies. It will have a fixed life and
will probably not pay any dividends.
