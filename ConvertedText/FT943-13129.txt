FT  21 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Mirror falls


   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO


Shares in Mirror Group Newspapers were hit as Smith New Court featured the
tabloid newspaper group as its key sell in a hefty review of the sector's
potential in the harsh light of the newspaper price war. The shares fell a
net 5 1/2 to 138 1/2 p with 4.1m traded.
The media team reduced its 1995 profits forecast for Mirror by Pounds 13.5m
to Pounds 77.5m. Analyst Mr David Forster commented: 'Irrespective of
whether there are further cover price cuts, the outlook for the profits of
the national newspapers has changed.' The house also cut forecasts for
Telegraph by Pounds 5m to Pounds 44m, Daily Mail & General Trust by Pounds
8m to Pounds 92m and United Newspapers by Pounds 13.5m to Pounds 151m.
Telegraph and Daily Mail were steady at 367p and 1035p and United, which
remains on Smith's buy list, added 4 at 537p.
Shell Transport was a healthy market, the shares boosted 6 1/2 to 722p on
turnover of 4.1m by a recommendation from Nomura, the Japanese-owned
investment house. The house oils team said: 'The market is seriously
underestimating the scale of recovery in profits which will take place over
the next five years.'
Nomura has increased its 1995 profits forecast by Pounds 325m to Pounds
4.61bn and its 1996 fig-ure by Pounds 420m to Pounds 5.32bn.
Chemicals leader ICI firmed a penny to 811p as the impact of an upgrade and
change of stance by one leading investment bank filtered through into the
market. BZW raised its 1995 profits forecast by Pounds 80m to Pounds 700m
and put the stock back on its buy list. Courtaulds bounced 7 to 516p on
enthusiasm for the stock following Tuesday's annual meeting.
Profit-taking ahead of figures due today saw Wellcome tumble 16 to 615p.
One of the food industry's oldest bid rumours was rehashed yesterday as
United Biscuits raced forward under the seemingly watchful eye of Cadbury
Schweppes. The latter was said to be considering dumping its 25 per cent
stake in US group Dr Pepper, having been denied a board seat and facing a
bitter poison pill should it decide to opt for a full bid, and instead
consider a UK alternative. UB shares rose 10 to 316p, while Cadbury slipped
3 1/2 to 444p.
Optimism that J. Sainsbury will enter the bidding for William Low saw the
latter's shares move forward 5 to 261p. Kwik Save was again in the frame in
the guise of its largest shareholder Dairy Farm, and climbed 20 to 557p.
Sainsbury eased 2 to 398p and Tesco a half-penny to 238p. Argyll's bullish
trading statement on Tuesday saw the shares advance 8 to 259p.
Industrial conglomerate BTR was busy as Tuesday's cautious note from UBS
continued to exact a toll. The shares shed 2 to 368p with volume, at 8.9m,
once again heavy.
Shipbuilder VSEL raced 34 ahead to 908p at the prospect of diminished
competition with the near certain closure of rival Swan Hunter. One analyst
said: 'With Swan Hunter out of the picture, VSEL is left with a near
monopoly in the surface war ships market.' There was some talk in the market
that the company may announce defence orders at today's annual meeting.
Defence electronics group GEC eased a fraction to 272 1/2 p, after it
launched a Pounds 100m 8 per cent bond, maturing in five years. The issue is
being lead managed by Goldman Sachs.
Favourable comment on Tuesday's announcement from British Aerospace of the
sale of its Space Systems unit to Matra Marconi helped the shares gain 4 at
494p. Shares in engineering group Bullough were in demand ahead of next
week's interim figures and put on 3 at 141p.
Paper and packaging group David S. Smith added 22 at 550p following a well
received set of figures that saw full-year profits rise Pounds 15.1m to
Pounds 42.2m, prompting a rash of upgrades.
Vodafone advanced 9 to 553p, with Hoare Govett positive following the annual
meeting.
US debt agency Standard & Poor's downgraded part of Forte's debt portfolio.
The shares lost 5 1/2 at 221p.
British Airways rose 5 to 434p in strong trade of 7.6m following a positive
trading statement from USAir, in which it holds a stake.
