FT  16 MAR 94 / Exports boost for engineering sector in Germany


   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES

Export growth will help Germany's engineering industry increase sales by 2
per cent this year. But a further 100,000 jobs will have to go, and a
sustained recovery will not emerge until 1995 and 1996, according to the
VDMA industry association.
Stronger growth was not possible because of weak domestic demand, and the
industry's average net return on sales of less than 1 per cent was too low
to finance investment, modernisation and new jobs, Mr Jan Kleinewefers,
association president, said.
Growing demand from outside Europe for German machines had been apparent for
a year, and in the past two months there had been signs of a change for the
better in west European orders, which were no longer slowing, he said.
However, average capacity utilisation was still at a record low of 75.6 per
cent at the end of last year. Only four sectors - steel plant, textile,
packaging and woodworking machinery - were working at satisfactory rates of
85 per cent or more. Highlights of last year - the worst since the war, and
marred by a 11 per cent slump in industry-wide sales to DM209bn (Pounds
81.3bn) - included a 10 per cent increase in sales to the US, Mr
Kleinewefers said. The US was now the industry's biggest single foreign
market. Exports to China doubled to DM4bn, helping bolster sales to east
Asia by 15 per cent. However, domestic orders fell a real 15 per cent, and a
drop of 13 per cent in demand from other European Union countries meant
total foreign orders rose only 1 per cent.
Turnover from export deliveries fell a real 7 per cent to DM110bn, but
machinery imports also shrank 12 per cent, leaving the sector showing a
trading surplus of more than DM50bn. Between the onset of the recession in
1990 and the end of last year, the plant and machinery industries - second
only in terms of sales to the automotive sector - had seen output fall by 20
per cent. Some 200,000 jobs had been lost in the west of the country.
