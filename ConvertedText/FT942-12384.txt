FT  29 APR 94 / International Company News: Newsprint groups set to raise
prices again

Several North American and European newsprint producers are expected to
announce their second price increase of the year in the next few weeks.
Their expectations have been lifted by firm demand, the high capacity at
which most mills are operating, and the low inventories carried by some
large publishers. Tighter domestic markets have led to a sharp fall in
exports from both Europe and North America.
Recent price rises have stuck for the first time in four years. European
discounts have narrowed by about 3-3.5 per cent, while prices in eastern
North America are up by about 6 to 7 per cent. Western US and Canadian
producers will raise their prices by a similar margin on May 1.
Mr Ronald Oberlander, chairman of Abitibi-Price, the world's biggest
producer of newsprint, told the annual meeting last week that 'the
possibility of another price increase this year should not be discounted'.
Fletcher Challenge Canada expects to announce a price increase by mid-May,
which would take effect in early autumn.
European newsprint consumption climbed by about 5 per cent in the first two
months of the year.
In the UK, mills have guaranteed prices only until the end of June, and are
expected to try for another increase before the end of the year.
According to Mr John Maine, an analyst at Resource Information Systems in
Virginia: 'It's not a question of whether we'll get a price increase, it's
when.' He predicts a discount cut of about Dollars 40 a tonne from the
present eastern US price, lifting the price to around Dollars 475 a tonne,
which is still well below the list price of Dollars 685.
Recent experience in the newsprint industry has shown however, that
announcing a price rise does not guarantee its implementation.
