FT  05 MAR 94 / Tokyo aid conditional, Zhu told

   TOKYO


Mr Zhu Rongji, Chinese vice premier, yesterday ended a 10-day visit to
Japan, with promises of continued economic support from Tokyo, but a tougher
line on aid.
Mr Tsutomu Hata, Japanese foreign minister, told Mr Zhu, the architect of
Chinese economic policy, that the size and terms of Japan's next package of
official yen loans would be conditional on Beijing's efforts to produce
environmental projects and clearer information on military spending. Japan's
current five-year Chinese aid package, worth Y810bn, runs out in 1995 and is
to be succeeded, on Tokyo's insistence, by two shorter term packages of two
and three years. Japan's switch to making aid to China more conditional is
line with a new directness in Tokyo's attitude to China on human rights,
defence spending and pollution.
