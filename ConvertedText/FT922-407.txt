FT  27 JUN 92 / BBC improves offer to staff


BROADCASTING unions were last night considering a new pay offer from the
BBC, after talks at the conciliation service Acas. The corporation offered a
4.3 per cent increase on pay and allowances with a minimum increase of
Pounds 400 to take effect from August 1. It had previously offered 3.7 per
cent with a guarantee that no one would receive less than Pounds 300.
