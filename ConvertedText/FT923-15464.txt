FT  02 JUL 92 / BR plunges Pounds 145m into the red: Rail privatisation
prospects suffer setback as losses deepen


   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent


PROSPECTS for the privatisation of British Rail worsened yesterday as it
became clear that the railway's brief era of profitability in the late 1980s
had decisively ended.
Results for the year to March 31 showed BR plunging into pre-tax losses of
Pounds 144.7m compared with the previous year's relatively modest loss of
Pounds 10.9m.
More significantly, the mismatch between falling income and record levels of
investment pushed borrowings up from Pounds 609.7m to Pounds 1.15bn - by far
the highest level since 1968, when they reached Pounds 1.6bn and triggered a
Pounds 1.2bn government write-off.
Board members acknowledged privately that the cost of servicing BR's
escalating debts meant the railway was unlikely to return to significant
profit in the foreseeable future, even in an economic upturn.
Recession was partly to blame for the rise in pre-tax losses. Passenger and
freight businesses alike suffered downturns in demand, leaving revenues
unable to keep up with rising costs. But the biggest impact on results came
from the severe deterioration in property profits and the cost of borrowing
to finance BR's Pounds 1bn-a-year investment programme.
In the late 1980s BR enjoyed three consecutive years of annual profits
exceeding Pounds 200m because of windfall gains from big commercial property
developments such as Broadgate, over London's Liverpool Street station.
These profits enabled the railway to finance investment from internal
resources. But with the commercial property boom now over, BR cannot make
enough money from running trains to plug the gap.
InterCity, commonly regarded as the jewel in BR's crown, barely broke even
in the year to March 31, its operating profits falling from Pounds 49.7m to
Pounds 2m. The only other part of the railway to show an operating surplus
was trainload freight, which made Pounds 67.5m (last year's figure for the
same period was Pounds 98.7m).
Railfreight Distribution lost Pounds 118.7m (Pounds 152.3m), Network
SouthEast lost Pounds 181.9m (Pounds 154.9m), and Regional Railways lost
Pounds 583.6m (Pounds 503.4m) - though the two passenger railway deficits
were more than wiped out by government subsidies of Pounds 892m (Pounds
601.5m).
BR's results come just two weeks before the expected publication of a white
paper setting out the government's plans for rail privatisation. The
corporation's poor financial performance may add to the private sector's
suspicions that there is little money to be made from running trains.
However, Mr Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin Atlantic, the airline
company, told BBC Radio 4's World At One programme yesterday that in the
next two weeks he would be submitting plans to BR to operate trains on four
to five routes.
