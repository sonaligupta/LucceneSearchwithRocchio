FT  12 MAR 93 / UK Company News: ICI freezes pay of board and most top
management


   By CATHERINE MILTON


IMPERIAL Chemical Industries said yesterday it had frozen the pay of all its
directors and most senior managers - about 200 worldwide - from January
1993.
Sir Denys Henderson, chairman, was paid Pounds 526,000 in 1992, a 5.4 per
cent increase on the previous year. The company's employees generally
received about 5.1 per cent.
The company said it felt the freeze was appropriate to current performance
and market rates. ICI last month reported a Pounds 384m pre-tax loss for the
year to December 31, following exceptional charges of Pounds 949m.
The level of all directors pay, including the chairman's, was set at the end
of 1991 by a committee of non-executive directors. The company sets pay for
senior managers.
Total pay for all ICI's directors fell in 1992 by more than 6 per cent to
Pounds 2.8m, mainly because of the departure of Sir Patrick Meaney, who
died, and the retirement of other senior directors. ICI said replacements
would earn less.
The company plans to cut nearly half of its headquarters staff and may
abandon its London headquarters at Millbank.
The Hay management consultants recently reported that directors in the UK
were increasing their total pay at the rate of about 8 per cent, compared
with about 13 per cent last summer.
ICI's capital expenditure figures were mis-stated on March 8. Between 1981
and 1991, total capital spending was Pounds 7.6bn, of which Pounds 3.52bn
was spent in the UK and Pounds 4.08bn abroad.
