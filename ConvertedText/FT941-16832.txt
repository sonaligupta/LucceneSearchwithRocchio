FT  07 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Expansion at B'ham Midshires


   By ALISON SMITH


Birmingham Midshires, the UK's 13th largest building society, has bought
over Pounds 45m of residential mortgages from the Dunedin Mortgage Company
for an undisclosed amount.
The mortgage book comprises 950 borrowers, with an average loan value of
Pounds 47 000.
It represents Birmingham Midshires' fourth purchase of a portfolio within
the last year, and takes the value of the assets acquired in that period to
Pounds 295m. Its assets now amount to more than Pounds 4bn.
The society views acquisition as a faster route to increasing asset size
than organic growth.
The sale of the DMC mortgage book follows the announcement last autumn that
the Internationale Nederlanden Groep, one of Europe's biggest life assurance
companies, was selling the Life Association of Scotland to Britannia Life.
Britannia did not want the Dunedin property group, the joint venture set up
in the 1980s in which LAS was one of the partners, saying it had enough
property development of its own, while Dunedin's Dutch parent no longer
wanted to continue in the UK mortgage market through the separate activities
of DMC.
