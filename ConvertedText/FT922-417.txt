FT  27 JUN 92 / Running-mates eliminated

   WASHINGTON


The choice of Senator Bill Bradley from New Jersey and Governor Anne
Richards of Texas for prominent speaking roles at next month's Democratic
convention is believed to be a sign that neither will emerge as Mr Bill
Clinton's presidential running-mate, Jurek Martin reports in Washington.
The vice-presidential nominee traditionally makes his acceptance speech on
the penultimate night of the convention and is not given any other speaking
slot. Mr Bradley has been selected as one of the keynote speakers in New
York and Governor Richards has been named convention chairman.
