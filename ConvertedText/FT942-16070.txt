FT  12 APR 94 / International Company News: New HK fund for investment in
China launched


   By JAMES HARDING


A fund investing in smaller companies listed in Hong Kong with interests in
China has been launched for European investors.
South Ocean Management, a Hong-Kong based company which has Dollars 28.7m of
US private investors' funds under management in Hong Kong, is launching
Cathay Value Fund, as yet of undetermined size, for investors outside the
US.
Allen & Company, a New York investment bank, is acquiring 50 per cent of
South Ocean, which was founded in 1992 and is headed by Mr Richard
McConnell.
Mr McConnell said he was investing in 43 smaller Hong Kong companies with
substantial interests in China's southern province of Guangdong, high growth
rates and low price earnings ratios.
He believes the small companies he selects will outstrip larger companies in
the Hang Seng index.
However, the US investors' accounts managed by South Ocean grew by 62 per
cent in 1993, compared with the 115 per cent rise of the Hang Seng.
Cathay Value Fund is the latest in a torrent of China-related funds launched
over the past three years. Mr McConnell, a fund manager from New York, told
a group of potential investors that 'Hong Kong looks like the Nasdaq (the US
over-the counter share market) in 1951'.
