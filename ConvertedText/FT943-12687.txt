FT  23 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Warner Estate in deal with Merivale


   By PETER FRANKLIN


Warner Estate Holdings yesterday announced it was to take a 20.5 per cent
stake in fellow property company, Merivale Moore.
The shareholding will result from the issue by Merivale to Warner of 3.5m
new shares as part consideration for a Pounds 6m portfolio of commercial
properties, typically high street shops, being purchased by Merivale.
The shares will be priced at 90p apiece or a sum equal to 90 per cent of the
pro forma net asset value of Merivale at June 30, whichever is the lower.
The balance of the consideration will be payable in cash.
Merivale has suffered two years of losses, but returned to the black in the
half-year to end-December 1993 with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 133,000.
The company has been following a strategy of disposing of low or non-income
pro-ducing assets and concentrating on building investment income in higher
yielding industrial and retail investments.
In May this year it sold its remaining two office buildings at Vision Park,
Cambridge. This holding had dominated the portfolio, accounting for some 25
per cent by value while contributing just Pounds 250,000 of income in
1993-94.
Merivale now has a small exposure to property development and a limited
involvement in the residential sector.
Merivale shares closed up 11p to 71p. Warner's shares were unchanged at
243p.
