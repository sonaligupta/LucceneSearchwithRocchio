FT  26 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian cotton export quota up


   By KUNAL BOSE


   CALCUTTA


THE INDIAN Cotton Advisory Board has sanctioned the export of an additional
200,000 bales of cotton of 170kg each during the season ending August 1993
after an upward revision of the crop estimate.
Earlier, the board had in phases released export quota totalling 1.5m bales.
It is allowing further exports as the cotton crop estimate for the 1992-93
season has been revised upward to 13m bales from the earlier 12.4m bales.
The total supply of cotton during the year will be over 16.3m bales,
including the opening stock of 3.3m bales. Moreover, the country has
imported 73,000 bales.
According to trade sources, the board should have allowed an additional
export of at least 500,000 bales to shore up the raw cotton prices.
A bumper crop and the delay in the announcement of the export quota have
kept the cotton prices low. But many of the aberrations in the market will
disappear if the government accepts the agriculture ministry suggestion of
total decontrol of raw cotton export.
It wants the abolition of the export quota system which favours the
government agencies and the minimum export prices for the commodity.
