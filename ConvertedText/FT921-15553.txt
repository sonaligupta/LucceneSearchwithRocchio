FT  09 JAN 92 / Insurers face Pounds 60m bill over collapse


   By RICHARD LAPPER


BRITISH insurers are to be told to expect a bill of about Pounds 60m to pay
claims from policyholders of subsidiaries of London United Investments, the
insurance group that failed two years ago, Richard Lapper writes.
The money is to be levied by the Policyholders' Protection Board - the body
responsible for funding claims against insolvent insurers - which has
written to the Association of British Insurers, notifying that it will need
to raise funds before the end of March.
The UK's 500 insurance companies are to be asked to pay a levy equivalent to
0.5 per cent of net premium income in 1990 to pay outstanding claims lodged
by customers of four insolvent LUI subsidiaries - Kingscroft Insurance, El
Paso Insurance, Lime Street Insurance and Mutual Re - all of which are now
insolvent.
The levy is by far the biggest to have been made under the terms of the
Policyholders' Protection Act 1975.
