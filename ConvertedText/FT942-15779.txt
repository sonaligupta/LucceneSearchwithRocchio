FT  13 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Lasmo steady


   By JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON


Long-running suggestions that Lasmo, the second largest of the UK oil
exploration and production stocks, was looking to raise in excess of Pounds
200m via a rights issue continued to circulate in the market but failed to
cause any damage to the Lasmo share price, which held at 129p.
Rumours yesterday were that a rights issue of two-for-seven at 100p a share
was in the wings. Rights offer talk has surrounded Lasmo since the group's
preliminary figures were announced at the end of last month. Oil analysts
said such a move was unlikely and that the oil sector still lacked
confidence despite the relative resilience of crude oil prices since the
last Opec agreement, which rolled over the previous output agreement for the
next two quarters.
The fall in profits at Tesco was broadly in line with expectations, the
shares strengthening following a mildly positive meeting with analysts.
Brokers remain divided, however, on the potential recovery for the sector.
With Tesco suggesting margin pressure easing and like-for-like sales
improving, some analysts believe that similar messages from other food
retailers indicate that the ravaged sector had turned the corner.
Mr Neil Curry at SG Warburg, who yesterday reiterated his buy recommendation
on Tesco, said: 'Today's results prove that the sector is coming back to
life.' He also raised his current year forecast to Pounds 555m, with a jump
to Pounds 602.5m for 1996. Others were not so positive, with Nomura
downgrading its profits estimates to Pounds 528m and Pounds 568m
respectively.
Analyst Mr Paul Smiddy said he believed Tesco shares would be dull in a
lacklustre sector. 'We need more evidence of steady like-for-like sales
growth,' he said. Tesco gained 3 at 218p with 10m traded. J. Sainsbury added
9 at 375p and Argyll a penny at 251p.
The banks with a major presence in the Far East continued to outperform the
other banking issues, with dealers citing the 260-point jump in the Hang
Seng index on Monday and the prospect of further strong rises in the near
term as being behind the big gains. HSBC raced up 25 to 805p and Standard
Chartered advanced 30 to 1104p.
Bank specialists said Standard shares had retreated around 50 per cent from
their peak of 1431p reached in February this year and would match any
immediate advance by the Hang Seng index. Some analysts were predicting that
the Hang Seng would breach the 10,000 level in the short term.
National Westminster continued its recent good performance that was prompted
mainly by a buy note issued by NatWest Securities. Yesterday's rise of 8 to
486p was said to have been triggered by a buy note from Morgan Stanley, the
US investment bank. NatWest's rise came at the expense of Barclays and
Lloyds, the latter losing 6 at 560p and the former 2 at 527p.
There was more keen interest in TSB shares, 5 higher at 225p following what
was said to have been aggressive buying interest from Swiss Bank.
Turnover in British Airways rose to 8.9m and the shares moved ahead 14 1/2
to 443 1/2 p following a recommendation from Smith New Court.
A weaker New York market prompted profit-taking in some of London's
internationally traded issues. Reuters Holdings fell 13 to 1956p in spite of
a well received annual meeting. Reed International lost 3 at 850p. BP eased
a penny to 373p despite a statement by Mr David Simon, the chief executive,
that oil prices should rise in the winter because of higher demand.
Engineering and aerospace company FR Group jumped 25 to 290p, with market
watchers cheered by the positive outlook from the company, which reported
figures in line with market forecasts. Analysts were also pleased by the 5
per cent increase in the dividend.
British Steel closed 3 1/2 ahead at 148 1/2 p after trade of 11m, with
Cazenove said to have recommended the stock. Glynwed International put on 6
1/2 at 364p after recommendations from Williams de Broe and NatWest
Securities.
A buy note from Strauss Turnbull inspired Unilever to a rise of 18 to 1046p.
A director of Hillsdown sold 500,000 ord-inary shares in the company at 179
1/2 p. The stock slipped 2 to 177p.
Among stores, Marks and Spencer added 2 1/2 at 421 1/2 p, with Hoare Govett
raising its dividend forecast and reiterating its positive stance. Laura
Ashley slid on news of the resignation of its chief executive. The shares
later rallied to end 4 off at 81p.
Thorn EMI gained 19 at 1144p, with a recomendation from UBS said to have
helped.
Upton & Southern, the ambitious retailing group, was the third most heavily
traded stock in the market, with 16m shares dealt as the rump of the rights
issue was placed. The shares held at 34p.
David S. Smith, the paper, packaging and office supplies group, climbed 16
to 530p on appreciation of higher pulp prices. Credit Lyonnais Laing, which
has the company as its core holding in the sector, was said to have been
active.
