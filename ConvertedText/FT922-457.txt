FT  27 JUN 92 / Gardening: Plant of the Week - Philadelphus Belle Etoile


   By ARTHUR HELLYER


This is one of the numerous garden varieties of Mock Orange which vary
greatly in height, size of flower and the number of petals per bloom, and
also in fragrance. Belle Etoile is deliciously scented and throws its
perfume a long way. The flowers are single, pure white with a small purple
blotch in the centre, and are carried freely in good clusters. It averages 5
feet in height and a little more in diameter but can be kept smaller by
pruning immediately after flowering when the old flowering stems can be cut
out but the new growth retained or, at most, thinned a little. Other notably
good varieties in this group are Beauclerk, Manteau d'hermine, Sybille, all
with single flowers, and Virginal, with double flowers.
