FT  23 JUL 94 / UN backs forces for Georgia

The UN Security Council has given its blessing to a controversial Russian
peacekeeping force in Georgia on condition that UN military officers monitor
the operation. This is aimed at enforcing a truce between the former Soviet
republic and its dissident province of Abkhazia. The US, Britain and France
joined Russia in sponsoring the UN resolution welcoming the intervention by
3,000 Russian troops. Its adoption was facilitated by a change of heart by
Mr Edouard Shevardnadze, who now has asked for Moscow's help. Troops from
other former Soviet republics may join the Russian operation.
