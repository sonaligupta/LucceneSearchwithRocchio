FT  15 APR 94 / Rules on sale of discounted airline tickets tightened


   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent


The Civil Aviation Authority yesterday announced tougher rules for travel
agents selling discounted scheduled airline tickets and cheap air holidays
to give more protection for consumers should the agent or tour operator
fail.
Under the new guidelines, the CAA will prosecute 'bucket shops' and other
cheap ticket agents and tour operators selling discounted tickets without an
Air Travel Organisers' Licence (ATOL).
The guidelines stress that all ticket sales must be covered by a licence,
unless the airline has authorised its agents to provide a flight or a
guaranteed refund.
Mrs Helen Simpson, CAA head of licensing and finance, said: 'From our
discussions with airlines we believe very few airlines have a comprehensive
agency agreement with their consolidators (agents).
'From now on we will assume that all consolidators must hold an ATOL to
cover their sales to the public unless they can prove otherwise.'
The CAA is also asking airlines to review their ticket distribution
arrangements with consolidators and agents.
The ATOL scheme protects travellers from losing money or being stranded
abroad if their tour operator fails. ATOL operators are examined every year
to ensure they are financially sound.
Before receiving a licence, the tour operator must also lodge a financial
guarantee. The CAA uses this money to refund consumers or pay for people to
continue their holiday and travel home as planned should the operator go
bankrupt.
The CAA said that 128,000 consumers received refunds during the year ended
March 1993 and more than 30,000 people were repatriated. The total cost of
refunds and repatriations by the authority was Pounds 18.5m.
