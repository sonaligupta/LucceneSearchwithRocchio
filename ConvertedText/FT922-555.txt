FT  26 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Brown Shipley to be broken up


   By DAVID BARCHARD


BROWN SHIPLEY, the small UK merchant banking group, is to be broken up after
incurring a pre-tax loss of Pounds 27.1m in the year to March 31. The
group's holding company will now consist of stockbroking and investment
management businesses with a net asset value of Pounds 17.3m.
Its banking subsidiary has been sold for Pounds 1 to Kredietbank
Luxembourgeoise, Brown Shipley's main shareholder, while Leasing Management
Services, its other main business, has been sold to Woodchester Investments
for Pounds 5.9m in cash.
The sales complete a process begun in May when Brown Shipley sold its
insurance broking operations to Holmwoods Group for Pounds 30m in cash and
Pounds 3m in paper and its offshore operations to Standard Bank Investment
Corporation of South Africa for Pounds 10m.
Shareholders will be asked to approve the sale of the insurance group at an
extraordinary meeting on July 13. But the stock exchange allowed the sales
of the bank and its leasing subsidiary to go ahead without a meeting because
of KBL's position as Brown Shipley's main shareholder.
Mr William Dacombe, chairman and chief executive, said the decision to break
up the group was forced on it after its main businesses, leasing and
banking, fell into heavy losses.
Leasing Management Services, was hit by lease terminations which produced a
loss of Pounds 15m last year, while the bank's corporate lending book
notched up provisions of Pounds 14.7m. The two combined to drive Brown
Shipley, which made a loss of Pounds 5.5m in 1990/91, into an unsustainable
net loss of Pounds 28.6m in the year to March 31 1992.
At the start of 1991, the group had a total balance sheet of Pounds 1.07bn.
A year later it was down to Pounds 750m. Yesterday the group had a pro forma
balance sheet of Pounds 69.4m.
Mr Dacombe said the group was undercapitalised and had to dispose of its
subsidiaries. 'If we did not have this capital problem we would not be
selling things off,' he added.
The banking group had net assets of Pounds 10.4m at the end of March, but
made a loss of Pounds 32.5m last year. The terms of the sale allow KBL to
continue to use the Brown Shipley name.
