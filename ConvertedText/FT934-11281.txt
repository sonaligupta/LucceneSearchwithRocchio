FT  02 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Fiat gears up to boost Polish operation

FIAT, the Italian carmaker, is to expand its operations in Poland, with the
local assembly of its Uno small car set to start early next year.
Initially Fiat will carry out the final assembly of the cars at its plant at
Bielsko Biala in southern Poland from SKD (semi-knocked down) kits supplied
from Turin.
The Italian group, which has established a dominant position in the Polish
car industry following its takeover last year of FSM, the former Polish
state-owned car producer, will supply fully welded and painted Uno car
bodies and other important components from Italy.
Production of the Uno is planned to begin in January, with output likely to
total around 20,000 in 1994.
Fiat is also conducting a feasibility study into the building of a new paint
plant at its outdated Bielsko Biala factory as part of its plans to invest
around Dollars 840m (Pounds 565m) in its Polish operations from 1993 to
1996.
The new paint plant would allow the assembly capacity of the Bielsko Biala
factory to be raised and would enable Uno production in Poland to move later
to more sophisticated full CKD (completely knocked down) kit assembly, in
which the Uno car bodies would also be welded and painted in Poland.
Overall Fiat car production in Poland this year is expected virtually to
double to around 280,000 from 144,000 in 1992, according to Mr Paolo
Marinsek, managing director of Fiat Auto Poland.
Fiat's takeover of FSM, which was originally agreed with the Polish
authorities in May last year, was finally completed six weeks ago, when the
Italian carmaker assumed full operating control in the biggest privatisation
deal ever reached in Poland and one of the biggest ever undertaken in
eastern Europe.
The former FSM, which has now been renamed Fiat Auto Poland, is Fiat's sole
production location in the world for its smallest cars, the outdated 126,
which is sold only in Poland, and the Cinquecento, which has been launched
in the last 18 months for sale throughout Europe.
Fiat's strong local production presence had also allowed it to raise sharply
its share of the Polish market for imported cars, said Mr Marinsek.
The Polish new car market was expected to total more than 200,000 this year
compared with 198,000 in 1992 and Fiat expected to account for around 55 per
cent of all new car sales compared with 39 per cent last year, he said.
It expected to control around 31 per cent of all imported new cars and 65
per cent of sales of domestically produced cars.
Overall Fiat production in Poland should be running by December at 1,090
cars a day (280,000 a year) at its two plants, compared with 850 at the end
of 1992 and only 350 a day in September 1991, when it began the
restructuring of the FSM operations.
