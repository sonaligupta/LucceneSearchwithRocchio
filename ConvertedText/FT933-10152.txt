   By REUTER


   ZURICH


Swissair said that, despite an increase in load capacity in June, the
company's earnings outlook remained 'unsatisfactory', Reuter reports from
Zurich
It said 'there is no improvement yet in sight' and that a continuation of
'rigorous cost-control measures is therefore inevitable'.
The company in May said it was 'guardedly optimistic' that a positive 1993
result was possible. Swissair is expected to release first-half earnings
figures on Friday.
The company said its load capacity improved in June, to 63.8 from 62.2 per
cent in the same month a year ago. Demand rose 7 per cent against last time,
while capacity increased 5 per cent.
Traffic rose 5 per cent in Europe, and 6 per cent on intercontinental
flights. Traffic on flights to Latin America, the Middle East and southern
Europe, was flat or fell.
