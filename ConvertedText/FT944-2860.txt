FT  15 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris bourse majors on RPR
setback


   By Our Markets Staff


Weaker than expected US core rate CPI and capacity utilisation data gave
bourses an afternoon lift, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS saw the CAC-40 index add 12.91 at 1,930.02, but attention was fixed on
Rhone-Poulenc, whose US pharmaceuticals unit, Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, suffered
a major setback on Tuesday night when the US FDA advisory committee rejected
its Taxotere drug for the treatment of breast and lung cancer.
In Paris, RPR dropped FFr19.70 or 9 per cent to FFr197.50, after a session's
low of FFr190.60, while Rhone-Poulenc, after falling to FFr120.90, steadied
and closed with a loss of 60 centimes at FFr124 in heavy volume.
The effect on RPR's earnings would be considerable, commented Ms Virginia
Pascoe, European pharmaceuticals analyst at UBS in London, given that the
company had been pinning its hopes on Taxotere for entry into the global
market for cancer treatment. This setback could mean that a US launch would
be delayed until the fourth quarter of 1997, following a reapplication to
the US authorities.
Euro Disney, up 25 centimes at FFr9.60, was supported by news that it was to
cut ticket prices for entry to the theme park in an effort to boost
attendance.
AMSTERDAM set a slide in the aircraft manufacturer Fokker against a rise in
KPN, the heavily capitalised telecommunications group. The AEX index closed
0.38 higher at 407.19.
Fokker, in which Daimler, of Germany, has a majority stake, sank to a year's
low of Fl 12.10 during the day, before picking up slightly to close off Fl
2.20 or 15 per cent at Fl 12.30. This slide followed a further downgrading
by the group of its 1994 earnings forecast, and brings the year's share
price drop to nearly 51 per cent since it hit a peak of Fl 25 in late
January.
KPN, in contrast, rose 80 cents to Fl 55.60 on news late on Tuesday which
confirmed that its Unisource telecommunications joint venture was to link up
AT&T, of the US, with plans to invest up to Dollars 1bn building up a
European telecoms network.
FRANKFURT moved from an official Dax close of 2,024.77 to an Ibis indicated
2,040.94 by the end of the day, up 21.81 over 24 hours. Turnover rose from
DM4.8bn to DM5bn.
Commerzbank, scheduled to produce forecasts for the bourse in 1995, put on
DM6 at DM326.80 as Schroder, Munchmeyer & Hengst said that an expected
recovery in bank stocks would help the Dax hit the top of a 2,000 to 2,400
range by mid-1995.
But cyclicals, not favoured by SMH, won the day. The big three chemicals
moved up as a group, Hoechst leading with a rise of DM6.40 to DM316.60.
Elsewhere there was selective buying in Deutsche Babcock, up DM4.50 at
DM202.50, and Daimler, DM20.20 better at DM740.50 after it said that its
1994 operating profits would at least double the DM926m of the first six
months.
MILAN closed under further pressure as growing political tensions and
end-account position squaring pushed prices lower. The Comit index rose 1.27
to 582.91 but the real-time Mibtel index fell another 157 or 1.7 per cent to
9,279.
Olivetti was L29 higher at L1,893 after European Union criticism of the
government's decision to charge the Omnitel cellular telephone consortium
for its licence.
Ambroveneto shed L95 to L4,371 after Tuesday's meeting of shareholders
appeared to rule out any shake-up in its controlling group.
ZURICH featured a SFr13 recovery to SFr1,084 in UBS bearers, still down 9.9
per cent since the end of September when the board joined its battle for
influence with Mr Martin Ebner. The SMI rose 15.4 to 2,581.
Nestle picked up SFr10 to SFr1,254 after Credit Suisse revised upwards its
earnings estimates for the coming three years. The forecasts were cut
temporarily after Nestle excluded specific US sales from its 10-month sales
figures.
Roche certificates rose SFr100 to regain the SFr6,000 level for the first
time since September 23, supported by news that its US subsidiary Roche
Biomedical was to merge its laboratory business with National Health to form
a new company with annual revenues of about Dollars 1.7bn.
BRUSSELS saw the Bel-20 index up 5.53 at 1,385.86, but this excluded Arbed,
which fell BFr140 to BFr4,780. The Luxembourg-based steelmaker took a
cautious view of 1995 prospects after the market closed on Tuesday.
STOCKHOLM ended lower after pressure on bank shares, which fell 2 per cent
as the Affarsvarlden General index eased 4.10 to 1,463.80. Svenska
Handelsbanken 'B' declined SKr2 to SKr98, and S-E-Banken 'A' by SKr1.10 to
SKr43.30 in spite of a denial by the Swedish government that it planned some
form of new tax on the industry.
VIENNA eased in light trade, with the ATX index down 3.27 to 1,026.83. But
Economos soared Sch111 to Sch525 as trading resumed after a two-month
suspension, the latter prompted by comments by the seal and washer maker
that it was facing a liquidity crisis due to non-payment of debts by
customers.
