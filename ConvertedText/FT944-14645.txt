FT  21 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper climbs to fresh highs as
metals surge


Copper's price on the London Metal Exchange reached its highest level for
nearly four years yesterday as investment fund and speculator activity
continued to boost all metals.
Aluminium reached a fresh four-year high and nickel touched a two-year peak.
Some analysts suggested there were solid reasons for the surge. Mr Wiktor
Bielski, analyst at Bain & Co, a Deutsche Bank subsidiary, said that
first-half demand for aluminium, copper and nickel had risen by 7 per cent
compared with the same months of 1993. He added that lead and zinc demand
was up by 4 per cent, which was 'twice as strong as even ardent bulls had
predicted'.
Meanwhile, added Mr Bielski, supplies had fallen along with exports from the
former eastern bloc - apart from those of aluminium. Also, some LME stock
was not immediately available because it was tied up by financing deals.
'Sensationally strong' fundamentals would ensure that, even if prices fell
because of profit-taking, they would recover quickly, he insisted.
However, Mr Nick Moore at Ord Minnett, an associate of Jardine Fleming,
warned there was a great deal of moth-balled capacity that producers could
quickly re-activate.
'The market is behaving as if stocks are at critically low levels and they
clearly are not,' he said.
Three-month copper, after moving briefly above USDollars 2,600 a tonne for
the first time since January 1991, closed last night at Dollars 2,584.25 a
tonne, up Dollars 44.75.
Aluminium closed up Dollars 34 at Dollars 1.774.50 and nickel was at Dollars
7,022.50, up Dollars 127.50.
