FT  04 AUG 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar falls back on indicators


   By JAMES BLITZ


THE DOLLAR was boosted against the D-Mark by a new threat of central bank
intervention yesterday, but later lost ground on a lacklustre set of US
economic indicators writes James Blitz.
An unnamed official at the Bank of Italy said the central banks were
prepared to intervene in the market again to keep the dollar off its lows,
and this boosted the currency by  1/2 pfennig up to DM1.4765 in the European
morning.
The currency slipped later as a mixed bag of indicators showed no clear sign
of an economic upturn in the US. Construction spending in the US fell by 1.5
per cent in June, while the National Association of Purchasing Managers
Index for July rose to 54.2 per cent from 52.8 per cent, with supplier
deliveries the slowest since March 1989.
The dollar finished a net  1/2 pfennig down at DM1.4760. In New York it gave
further ground to close at DM1.4733.
There is uncertainty in the markets as to whether the central banks have a
firm policy to keep the dollar above its all-time low.
According to analysts at UBS Phillips & Drew in London: 'The threat of
another bout of central bank intervention will continue to deter the
establishment of aggressive short dollar positions.' But other traders feel
that the authorities in the US may be willing to see the dollar drop below
the historic low of DM1.4470 after all.
One London-based analyst wondered why there was no official intervention
last week when the dollar fell below levels at which the central banks had
intervened on July 20. 'If the central banks do not show their hand shortly
between DM1.4600 and DM1.4470, they will risk losing credibility in the eyes
of the market,' he said.
The D-Mark lost some ground to the dollar and European currencies after an
opinion poll conducted by French newspaper La Liberation showed that 57 per
cent of those polled would vote in favour of European political and monetary
union in next month's French referendum. Signs that the Maastricht treaty
will be ratified weakened the D-Mark because the treaty commits European
Community member countries to stringent convergence criteria.
However, this was not enough to offset the D-Mark's increasing
attractiveness. Sterling ended the day lower at DM2.8400 from a previous
close of DM2.8430, while the German unit edged up to FFr3.3790 after a
previous FFr3.3780.
The Italian lira was firm against the D-Mark yesterday following the Italian
government's decision to abolish the scala mobile, which has set
inflation-linked wage rises for most of Italy's workers since 1945. The lira
closed at L755.3 to the D-Mark, compared to L755.9 previously.
