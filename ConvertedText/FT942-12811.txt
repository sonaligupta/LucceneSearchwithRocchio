FT  28 APR 94 / World Trade News: India opens highway investment


   By SHIRAZ SIDHVA


   NEW DELHI


The Indian government is offering incentives to private foreign and domestic
companies to invest Dollars 4.7bn in 27 projects to construct bypass roads,
bridges and expressways in 16 Indian states. This is the first time
construction of India's national highways has been opened to the private
sector, as part of India's liberalisation efforts.
Foreign private investors will be permitted to hold 100 per cent equity and
regardless of the size of the project, would be exempted from special
clearances usually required from the government's Public Investment Board
and the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs.
The Ministry of Surface Transport, which is offering the projects on a
build, operate and transfer basis, says the government guarantees 'a minimum
reasonable rate of return' to investors, without specifying what rate would
be considered reasonable.
The ministry has recently signed a memorandum of understanding with
Infrastructure, Leasing and Financial Services, a Bombay-based construction
company partly owned by ORIX Corporation of Japan, and the International
Finance Corporation, Washington, to build a four-lane 10.14km
asphalt-concrete road bypassing Panvel town on the Bombay-Pune national
highway.
Toll rates applicable for each project would be decided in consultation with
the government and the builder would be expected to operate the expressway
for a period of 20 to 25 years.
