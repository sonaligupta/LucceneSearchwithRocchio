FT  23 JUL 93 / Proposals for M25 improvement


Even before the M25 was fully open in 1986, its traffic jams had become the
butt of comedians. The busiest sections, near Heathrow, between junctions 12
and 16, carry up to 200,000 vehicles a day; each section was intended to
take 80,000. Proposals put forward are:
To build three-lane link roads alongside the present four-lane motor way
between Junctions 12 and 15. To build two-lane link roads between junctions
15 and 16 near the M40 at a cost of Pounds 52m. A public consultation was
announced yesterday.
To widen the existing three-lane motorway between junctions 7 and 8 and
junctions 10 and 11 to four lanes, as part of plans to widen the whole
motorway to four lanes in each direction announced in the 1989 roads white
paper.
