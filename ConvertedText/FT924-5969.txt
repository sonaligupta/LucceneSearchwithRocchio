FT  24 NOV 92 / Arts: Today's Television


   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY


That warfare is disciplined insanity is borne out by today's Assignment
(7.45 BBC2) which tells of a plan for the US and Russia to join in building
a 'space shield' against missiles. Britain, we are told, not only fears
losing the 'special relationship' with Washington, but that Russia may end
up with a defence system which could defeat her Trident missiles in the
event of their use against Moscow. Over to you Dr Strangelove.
Can you name the winner of last year's Turner Prize? Any previous winner?
Then perhaps you will not want to watch this year's cheque for Pounds 20,000
being given to 'a British artist under 50 for an outstanding exhibition or
other presentation' on Without Walls (9.00 C4). Of course it is meant to put
us all more in touch with contemporary art, but a change in attitude among
artists, a keener desire to please their contemporaries, might do more.
Inside Story promises the first television interview with an IRA double
agent: a member of an IRA cell who was also paid as an undercover agent for
the RUC Special Branch. He now lives under an assumed name in another
country (10.25 BBC1).
