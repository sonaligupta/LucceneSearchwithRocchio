   MONTREAL


Mr Rhys Eyton, 58, has stepped down as president and chief executive of PWA,
parent of Canadian International Airlines, but will become board chairman.
Mr Kevin Jenkins, operating head of the airline, will succeed him.
Mr Eyton, criticised for over-paying for competitor Wardair in the 1980s,
led PWA's fight to survive through the long recession, which culminated in a
CDollars 246m (USDollars 177m) equity infusion by American Airlines.
