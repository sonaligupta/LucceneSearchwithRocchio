Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez, the French utilities, construction and
communications group, yesterday confirmed it more than doubled net profits,
to FFr804m (Dollars 137.4m), in 1993 and expressed optimism about prospects
for the current year.
Mr Jerome Monod, chairman, said the worst of the economic recession was
over, and outlined 'considerable opportunities' in the public works and
utilities markets.
'In France, and in the European Union, infrastructure programmes, including
motorways, high speed trains and airports, will soon be launched', he said.
Mr Monod said the group's construction activities would be reinforced
through the merger between its Dumez and GTM-Entrepose subsidiaries.
The group is proposing a dividend of FFr16.50 for last year, compared with
FFr15 in 1992.
