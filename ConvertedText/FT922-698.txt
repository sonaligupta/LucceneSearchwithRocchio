FT  26 JUN 92 / US probes arms sales


   By REUTER


   WASHINGTON


THE special prosecutor in the Iran-Contra scandal during the Reagan
presidency said yesterday he was investigating whether officials at the
'highest level of the government' broke the law over a 1985 US arms shipment
to Iran via Israel, Reuter reports from Washington.
Mr Lawrence Walsh said his investigation, which is in its final phase, was
expected to be concluded this summer and he had yet to decide on bringing
additional criminal charges.
The secret White House operation sold arms to Iran in 1985-86, violating an
official US trade embargo, to try to win the release of US hostages held in
Lebanon.
Mr Walsh said in a special report to Congress the alleged cover-up involved
inquiries by the presidentially appointed Tower commission, Congress and his
own 5 1/2 -year investigation.
