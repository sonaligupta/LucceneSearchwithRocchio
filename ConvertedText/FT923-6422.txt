FT  25 AUG 92 / Iran to supply gas to Azerbaijan


   By REUTER


Iran will supply natural gas and other fuels to the Nakhichevan region of
Azerbaijan, the Iranian news agency IRNA reported yesterday.
Nakhichevan, sandwiched between Iran, Armenia and Turkey, is facing a fuel
shortage because of a blockade by Armenia, which has been fighting an
undeclared war with Azerbaijan over the disputed enclave of
Nagorno-Karabakh.
