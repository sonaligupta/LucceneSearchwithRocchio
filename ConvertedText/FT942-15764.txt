FT  14 APR 94 / EU adopts works councils plan


More than 1,000 pan-European companies will have to set up elected works
councils under a proposal adopted by the European Commission yesterday. The
plan is to ensure that workers' representatives in companies employing more
than 1,000 people, and more than 100 in at least two member states, are
consulted and informed on cross-border business decisions which affect them.
EU labour and employment ministers will discuss the proposal next Tuesday,
after which it will get a fast-track first reading from a supportive
European Parliament. Ministerial approval is expected in June, with formal
adoption in October after a second parliament reading.
The UK, which has an opt-out from the Social Chapter of the Maastricht
treaty, will not have to put the directive on its national statute book.
However, British companies with continental plants will be affected, and the
Commission expects works councils to seep into the UK as multinationals
respond to union pressure for common consultation rules.
