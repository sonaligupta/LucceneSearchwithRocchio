FT  30 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the markets): Stocks
fall aids copper advance


   By RICHARD MOONEY


The London Metal Exchange copper market stepped up a gear at the end of the
week to break out of its recent constricted trading range. And most other
LME contracts followed the upward move.
Bullish chart patterns and signs of renewed nearby supply tightness had
encouraged a resurgence of the speculative buying that lifted copper prices
to 8 1/2 -month peaks in the middle of March, dealers explained as the price
climbed to a 4-week high yesterday morning.
Added impetus was given by another fall in LME warehouse stocks of the
metal, which now stand at the lowest level since last July and are 23 per
cent below the 16-year high reached in January.
Resistance at Dollars 1,930 a tonne for three months delivery had been
broken in after hours trading on Thursday evening. The rise stalled
yesterday at Dollars 1,956 and the price closed at Dollars 1,952.50, up
Dollars 23 on the day and Dollars 38.75 on the week. But dealers still
thought an assault on the recent high of Dollars 1,973 a tonne was possible
after the bank holiday. 'It looks like a good solid technical move,' one
told the Reuter news agency.
Other base metal prices were drawn higher in copper's wake, notably lead and
nickel. The former extended its gain on the week to Dollars 19.75 at Dollars
469.50 a tonne for three months delivery. But traders thought strong
resistance was likely frustrate any early attempt to regain the Dollars
500-plus levels seen a few months ago.
Three months nickel put on another Dollars 137.50 yesterday, taking its rise
on the week to Dollars 285 at Dollars 5,592.50 a tonne. This latest advance
was aided by the announcement of a sharp fall in LME stocks.
Aluminium was able to restablish itself above Dollars 1,300 a tonne for
three months delivery - closing yesterday at Dollars 1,306.75, up Dollars
22.25 overall. But zinc, while staging a substantial rally, remained below
the Dollars 960-a-tonne resistance level.
Precious metals also finished well into the plus columns. Gains in the gold
market encouraged by US dollar weakness and a rise in the CRB index, an
inflation indicator, prompted covering by players who had sold the metal
short earlier in the week as fears of widespread South African election
violence receded, dealers explained.
The London price closed yesterday at Dollars 376.10 a troy ounce, up Dollars
6.60 from a week earlier.
Speculative interest also revived in the silver market, with cash metal
closing in London at Dollars 5.19 1/2 an ounce, up 12 cents on the week.
'It's got a bit more potential than gold,' said one dealer. 'It could be
aiming at Dollars 5.35.' But most doubted that it could build sufficient
momentum for a renewed attempt on the Dollars 6 mark in the near future.
At the London Commodity Exchange May delivery coffee futures yesterday
chalked up a fresh 5-year high of Dollars 1,575 a tonne, driven by renewed
interest from US investment funds. The price closed at Dollars 1,563, up
Dollars 42 on the day and Dollars 90 overall, helped by continuing concern
about nearby supply tightness.
News in mid-week that the arabica indicator price for the coffee producers'
export retention scheme had passed the point at which retention would be
halted appeared to be shrugged off by traders. They had similarly ignored
Monday's news that the robusta indicator, which had already passed the
trigger for retention to be suspended, had risen above the level at which
releases from retention stocks could begin.
