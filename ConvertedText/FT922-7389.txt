FT  19 MAY 92 / UK Company News: ACT rises 34% and makes Pounds 5m purchase


   By ALAN CANE


SALES AND profits last year at ACT, the Birmingham-based computing services
company, continued to display the vigorous growth the company has been
experiencing since it disposed of Apricot, its hardware arm, to Mitsubishi
of Japan two years ago.
Yesterday it reported sales for the year to March 31 up 21 per cent at
Pounds 119.4m (Pounds 98.8m) while pre-tax profits rose 34 per cent to
Pounds 17m (Pounds 12.7m). The results were at the top end of analysts'
expectations. The shares rose 4p to 192p.
ACT also announced the acquisition of Medical Computer Services, which
specialises in systems for private health care, for Pounds 5.02m, satisfied
by the issue of 2.7m shares and the payment of about Pounds 42,000 in
settlement of MCS share options.
Settlement in shares was at the request of the MCS owners. ACT has net cash
balances of Pounds 24.3m for acquisitions.
Mr Roger Foster, ACT founder and chairman, said each of the six divisions
made money in the year. However profits slipped at Logsys, a systems
integrator specialising in public sector contracts, which made Pounds
630,000 on sales of Pounds 27.5m and Computer Support, with Pounds 5.1m on
Pounds 26.8m.
In contrast, the financial services division, boosted by the acquisition of
Quotient and the Irish Kindle Group during the year, made pre-tax profits of
Pounds 7.5m on sales of Pounds 44m.
Mr Foster claimed the company's portfolio of products and market sectors was
now wide enough to protect it against downturns in specific sectors.
He emphasised the importance of software products, which were stable and
cash generative and in which the group had investments totalling more than
Pounds 50m.
Earnings per share were 10.83p (9.5p) and a final dividend of 3p is
recommended for a total of 4.5p, an increase of 20 per cent on the 3.75p
paid last time.
COMMENT
Even if the contributions from acquisitions is stripped away, ACT's
performance in a year which many computer companies thought the worst ever
is remarkable and the company's credibility is strengthening rapidly.
Analysts are pencilling in profits before tax of about Pounds 23m for the
present year and Pounds 27m next. With a prospective p/e of about 15 the
stock seems neither overpriced nor particularly risky.
