FT  15 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Zeneca pressures continue


   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY


WORRIES over the Pounds 1.3bn rights issue continued to overshadow the two
classes of Zeneca stock, in spite of highly encouraging news that one of the
group's key new drugs, Zestril, had been approved for distribution in the US
by that country's Food and Drug Administration.
Zestril is used in the treatment of congestive heart failure. Zeneca 'old'
shares managed a minor improvement at 617p after relatively high turnover of
4.2m, while the 'new' nil-paid stock settled a penny easier at 17p. There
were suggestions in the market that moves to relax US rules on trading in
Zeneca shares by marketmakers involved in the rights issue may well be
successful.
Marketmakers at firms involved in the issue are at present precluded from an
'active' trading role in Zeneca shares if the stock price falls to within 10
per cent of the 'rights' price in the five days prior to the close of the
offer.
ICI surged ahead 16 to close at a record post-Zeneca demerger high of 707p.
Turnover was a hefty 5.9m shares and said to have been boosted by keen local
and US buying interest.
