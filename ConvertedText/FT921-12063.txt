FT  29 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Anglo-Irish conference accepts end
to talks - Northern Ireland


   By Our Belfast Correspondent


THE BRITISH and Irish governments yesterday reluctantly accepted that it was
not possible to launch fresh political talks on Northern Ireland's future
before the UK general election.
At a meeting of the Anglo-Irish conference in Belfast, both sides insisted
that the various exchanges between the parties over the last two years had
been valuable in producing a basis for political dialogue.
Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr Gerry Collins, Irish
foreign affairs minister, said they hoped the potential for talks would be
developed at the appropriate time.
Asked about his own future, Mr Brooke said not only his commitment but also
his enjoyment of the affairs of Northern Ireland had been made consistently
clear.
Security matters dominated the agenda with the Irish government expressing
concern over the case of Mr Brian Nelson, a former Army agent awaiting
sentence in Belfast for terrorist offences committed while he was a member
of a loyalist paramilitary organisation.
Nelson admitted several offences last week arising from an investigation by
Mr John Stevens, Cambridgeshire deputy chief constable, into allegations of
collusion between loyalist paramilitary groups and elements of the security
forces.
Ministers condemned the murder of eight Protestant construction workers by
the IRA near Cookstown earlier this month and reaffirmed their rejection of
any attempt to promote political objectives by violence.
Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to cross-border security. The use of
lethal force by the security forces and police accompaniment of soldiers on
patrol were also discussed.
