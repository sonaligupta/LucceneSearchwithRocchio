HEWLETT-Packard reported a 40 per cent rise in second-quarter earnings as
the computer and electronic equipment manufacturer continued to outperform
competitors in key market segments, including printers, minicomputers and
computer workstations.
Although earnings were at the high end of Wall Street estimates, HP's stock
price declined yesterday amid concerns that poor economic conditions in key
international markets may affect future earnings. The company's shares
closed down Dollars 2 3/4 at Dollars 74 3/8 .
Net earnings for the quarter were Dollars 326m, or Dollars 1.28 a share, up
from Dollars 233m, or 93 cents, in the second quarter of 1991.
Net revenue totalled Dollars 4.2bn, up 12 per cent from Dollars 3.7bn in the
same period last year. US revenues grew 14 per cent to Dollars 1.8bn, while
revenues from outside the US rose 11 per cent to Dollars 2.4bn.
Company officials said that second-quarter sales in Japan had declined 20
per cent from the same period last year, primarily affecting sales of
analytical instruments and computer workstations.
However, in addition to the strengthening of business in the US, the company
saw a rebound in UK sales, after a period of slow growth.
New orders booked during the quarter rose 16 per cent in the US, while order
growth overseas grew 8 per cent, for overall growth of 11 per cent.
'We turned a reasonable revenue increase into outstanding profit growth,
thanks to our ongoing efforts to manage expenses,' said Mr John Young,
president and chief executive.
'We are concerned about the near term because of uncertainty over the US
recovery as well as sluggish conditions in some key economies around the
world,' he added.
For the six-month period, net earnings increased 44 per cent to Dollars
632m, or 2.49 a share, from Dollars 438m, or Dollars 1.76, in the first half
of fiscal 1991.
Net revenue increased 13 per cent to Dollars 8bn including Dollars 3.4bn in
US sales and Dollars 4.6bn from outside the US.
