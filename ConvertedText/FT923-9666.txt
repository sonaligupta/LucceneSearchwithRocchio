FT  04 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Silvermines sells ballscrews arm to THK of
Japan


   By ANDREW BAXTER


SILVERMINES, the Dublin-based engineering, electrical and property company,
is selling its Coventry-based PGM Ballscrews business to THK of Japan for
Pounds 3.6m.
The deal will give THK its first manufacturing base outside Japan and
greater access to the European ballscrew market ahead of the European Single
Market reforms.
Ballscrews are an essential component of machine tools and other industrial
machinery, converting rotary motion into linear motion and vice-versa.
PGM is the second largest UK ballscrew manufacturer with annual sales of
Pounds 3.5m and 104 employees.
The deal is one of few struck recently by Japanese companies in the European
machinery sector. They either prefer greenfield expansion or are deterred by
current market conditions. It is also one of few moves by machine tool part
manufacturers to emulate Japanese machine tool builders by manufacturing in
Europe.
Founded in 1971 by the Teramachi family, THK is the Japanese market leader
in linear motion systems with a 75 per cent market share. Still family
controlled, it is quoted over-the-counter in Japan and had sales last year
of Y78bn (Pounds 339m) and 2,536 employees.
THK said it intended to maintain the existing PGM management and employee
structure but may strengthen both with support from Japan. The deal includes
PGM's 96.8 per cent subsidiary PGM Ballscrews Ireland.
