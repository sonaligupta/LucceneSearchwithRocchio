FT  21 JUL 94 / British Library project 'a shambles'


   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor


The construction of the new British Library in central London has
degenerated into a shambles, a committee of MPs says in a report on the
project published yesterday.
The Commons National Heritage committee says that more than 16 years after
the building was started, no one has any idea when the building will be
completed, when it will open or how much it will cost.
The committee calls for a public inquiry into the project to establish
whether there has been maladministration and incompetence in its design and
construction.
Earlier this month, Mr Peter Brooke, the then heritage secretary, told the
committee that the Treasury held the contractors responsible for delays and
cost overruns.
He said the cost of the library would exceed the Pounds 450m ceiling imposed
in 1990. The Treasury had agreed to fund the extra spending after being
convinced that the extra money could be recovered from contractors, whose
mistakes in planning and installing equipment had contributed to the
spiralling cost.
The report describes the building, designed by Mr Colin St John Wilson, as
'an edifice that resembles a Babylonian ziggurat seen through a fun-fair
distorting mirror'.
The report adds: 'The new building's interior will be at best clinically
utilitarian and at worst actively unattractive.'
The committee recommends that the existing Round Reading Room in the British
Museum be retained for the British Library's use.
It also says that the land to the north of the site of the new library, near
St Pancras station, be retained to provide space for expansion.
The report says that the building of the new opera house at Glyndebourne
showed that attractive buildings could be delivered on time and to budget.
