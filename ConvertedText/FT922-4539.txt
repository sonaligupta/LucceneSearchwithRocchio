FT  05 JUN 92 / Cut forecast in small accountancy firms


   By ANDREW JACK


THE NUMBER of small British accountancy firms is likely to fall by more than
5 per cent in the coming year, according to a survey released yesterday by
Michael Page Finance, recruitment specialists.
About 400 of the 10,000 firms and sole practitioners in the UK will be sold
and at least 100 more will merge, an analysis of the intentions of 945
accountants suggests. Three quarters of those questioned were small firms
with between one and three partners.
Statistics for the last year from larger and medium-sized accountancy firms
show revenue growth often below the level of inflation. Job reductions were
widespread.
In the two years to December last year, 7 per cent of firms merged and 9 per
cent acquired other firms, compared with 4 per cent and 9 per cent
respectively in the previous two-year period.
The number of acquisitions doubled in the north of England and Scotland
between the two periods, and declined in the south-east and south-west of
England.
Twelve per cent of firms predicted expansion primarily by merger or
acquisition, while 32 per cent saw little prospect of growing in that way.
The value of firms acquired has also been falling. More than four fifths of
those acquiring other practices use a multiple of their gross recurring fees
from clients to assess their worth.
The multiple being used by acquisitive practices has fallen from a range of
1.25 times to twice fees in the late 1980s down to between 0.75 times and
1.2 times this year. That partly reflects the greater risks that existing
clients will not pay their bills or remain loyal to the same firm. The
survey also showed that 85 per cent of firms considered that acquisitions
had succeeded.
