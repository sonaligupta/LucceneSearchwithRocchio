BANQUE Generale du Luxembourg increased its net profit by 16 per cent to
LFr975m (Dollars 27.31m) from LFr840m in the first half of 1993, writes
Andrew Hill in Brussels.
The group, one of Luxembourg's biggest banks, said it had benefited from a
strong increase in interest, commission and trading income. Its balance
sheet at June 30 totalled LFr688bn, up 6.2 per cent on the end of last year.
Banque Generale customer deposits were also up LFr53.5bn to LFr493bn at June
30, a rise of nearly 11 per cent.
The company said the economic slowdown had led to increased use of existing
credit lines and advances by private and corporate customers, but new loan
applications had dropped.
