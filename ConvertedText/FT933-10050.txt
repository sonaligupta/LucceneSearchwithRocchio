FT  06 AUG 93 / Market testing bulletin planned


   By JOHN WILLMAN


THE Cabinet Office is to launch a monthly publication in the autumn to
publicise details of Civil Service work being put out to tender as part of
the market-testing programme, John Willman writes.
The Contracts Bulletin will provide information about contracts to supply
services to government departments and agencies. It will also offer an
opportunity to advertise services to government purchasing managers.
The contract for producing the bulletin was itself put out to tender. It was
won by Business Information Publications, a Glasgow company which publishes
Contrax Weekly, which advertises public-sector contracts.
The cost of the bulletin will be met by the Pounds 120-a-year subscription,
with no expense to the taxpayer, the Cabinet Office said.
