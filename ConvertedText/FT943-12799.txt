FT  22 JUL 94 / International Company News: Comcast enlists Liberty Media in
battle for QVC


   By PATRICK HARVERSON


   NEW YORK


Comcast, the US cable and telecommunications group, yesterday bolstered its
offer for QVC when it announced that Liberty Media, a QVC shareholder, had
agreed to become Comcast's partner in an all-cash bid of Dollars 44-a-share
for the television home shopping network.
Previously, Comcast had offered to pay Dollars 44-a-share in mix of cash and
stock for the 85 per cent of QVC it did not own, a bid that valued the home
shopping network at Dollars 2.2bn. That bid forced QVC to abandon its
earlier plan to merge with CBS, the broadcast television group which had
offered to pay Dollars 38-a-share for the company.
QVC yesterday said it was reviewing the revised offer from Comcast and
Liberty Media, which owns 20 per cent of QVC. It said it would continue to
'explore alternatives to maximise shareholder value'. News of the
Comcast-Liberty Media offer depressed QVC's share price yesterday as it
removed the possibility that Tele-Communications (TCI), the cable group and
parent of Liberty Media, might launch a counter bid for QVC.
Mr John Malone, TCI chairman, had expressed dissatisfaction with Comcast's
offer for QVC, and investors had hoped that TCI, or another big
entertainment or telecommunications company, might launch a bid for QVC.
Shares in QVC fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 44 on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday. Liberty Media rose Dollars  13/16 to Dollars 21 1/16 and Comcast
rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 16 3/4 .
If the Comcast-Liberty Media offer succeeds, Comcast will end up owning 57
per cent and Liberty Media 43 per cent of QVC. The two companies have agreed
that Comcast will manage QVC once the merger is completed, but there was no
indication whether Mr Barry Diller, chairman of QVC who masterminded the
plan to merge with CBS, would stay on.
