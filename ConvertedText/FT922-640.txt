FT  26 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei regains 16,000
level on late buying

   TOKYO


LAST-MINUTE buying by a leading Japanese broker helped the Nikkei index
recover to above the 16,000 mark yesterday, after falling to its lowest
level since October 1986 on Wednesday, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average finished 290.05 firmer at 16,143.72. It registered a
day's low of 15,733.14 in early trading on encountering selling by
individuals and companies, and rebounded on small-lot buying by foreigners
and institutions to reach a high of 16,217.88 in the afternoon.
Volume picked up to 250m shares from 227m, traders noting US demand.
Advances outnumbered declines by 576 to 366, with 164 issues unchanged. The
Topix index of all first section stocks improved 15.13 to 1,248.50, but in
London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index ended 2.37 easier at 982.14.
Lower interest rates encouraged investors. Bonds rallied, with the yield on
the number 129 10-year issue falling from 5.35 to 5.325 per cent. Money
market participants also anticipated lower short-term rates, as the
three-month certificates of deposit rate eased to 4.5 per cent from 4.52 per
cent.
Traders said an absence of arbitrage selling also supported the Nikkei.
However, some sceptics argued that Japanese brokers were pushing up equity
prices ahead of today's spate of shareholders' meetings. More than 1,800
companies will hold shareholders' meetings today.
High-technology issues were sought by foreign investors. Toshiba surged
ahead Y39 to Y633 and Sony Y220 to Y4,250. Other blue chips were also
sought, with Nippon Steel gaining Y4 to Y265 and Nissan Motor Y23 to Y558.
Bank issues rose on bargain hunting, with Industrial Bank of Japan putting
on Y70 to Y1,550 and Fuji Bank Y20 to Y1,230. Trust banks, on the other
hand, thought to be facing a rise in bad loans due to extensive lending to
real estate companies, were weaker. Mitsui Trust and Banking declined Y15 to
Y630 and Sumitomo Trust and Banking Y5 to Y815.
Misawa Homes plunged by its daily limit of Y210 to Y940. The stock has lost
35 per cent in the past 10 days on rumours of growing debts at the company's
resort and golf course development subsidiaries.
NTT fell Y10,000 to an all-time low of Y581,000. 'With over 1.6m individual
investors, the plunge in NTT will definitely harm sentiment,' said a broker.
In Osaka, the OSE average moved forward 110.26 to 18,937.12 in volume of
22.3m shares.
Roundup
THE strongest feature among Pacific Rim markets yesterday was Hong Kong,

said nominally, after a 10-day boycott by stockbrokers. The BSE index
dropped 59.48, or 1.90 per cent, to 3,081.32.
KARACHI built on Wednesday's gains, the 100-share index putting on 33.94 to
1,558.07 for a two-day rise of 69.46, or 4.7 per cent, as institutions
bought fuel, energy and pharmaceutical shares.
