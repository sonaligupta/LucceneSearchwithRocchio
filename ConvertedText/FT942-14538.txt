FT  20 APR 94 / Ozone on ground is growing hazard


   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent


Amounts of low-level ozone are increasing steadily, bringing a risk of
breathing difficulties and damage to crops and buildings, says a government
report published yesterday.
Measures to curb low-level ozone, much of which is produced by cars, may not
be enough to enable the UK to meet international air quality targets for the
year 2000, the report argues.
Ozone is beneficial to people and plants when it occurs in the upper reaches
of the atmosphere because it absorbs harmful radiation from the sun, but is
'an aggressive pollutant' when it builds up near the ground, the report
says.
The environmental effects of high concentrations at low levels in the UK
'may currently be more important' than the loss of stratospheric -
high-level - ozone, it adds.
Southern England suffers more from smog caused by ozone than the north or
Scotland, it found. Low-level ozone is formed by the action of sunlight on
nitrogen oxides and organic compounds, much of which are emitted by cars.
At high concentrations ozone can damage human respiratory tracts and reduce
crop yields. Ozone also damages buildings: the effects have been estimated
to cost Dollars 2.5bn a year in the US, according to the report.
The document is the third in a series on air pollution prepared for the
Department of the Environment by its working group on photochemical
oxidants. It draws on data from a new network of ozone-monitoring stations
set up throughout the UK by the government.
Concentrations of low-level ozone in Europe are increasing at between 1 per
cent and 2 per cent a year, the report says.
