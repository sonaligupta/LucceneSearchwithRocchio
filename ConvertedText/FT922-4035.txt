FT  08 JUN 92 / World News in Brief: European Monetary System


The Danish krone went to the bottom of the EMS grid after Denmark's decision
not to ratify European political and monetary union. Sterling, adversely
affected by the Danish decision, was only just above the krone. The markets
will be watching whether the Italian lira slips further against the D-Mark
as Italy's political uncertainties undermine the currency's strength.

The chart shows the member currencies of the exchange rate mechanism
measured against the weakest currency in the EMS's narrow 2.25 per cent
fluctuation band. In practice, currencies in the EMS narrow band cannot rise
more than 2.25 per cent from the weakest currency in that part of the
system. Sterling, the Portuguese escudo and the Spanish peseta operate
within 6 per cent bands.
