FT  26 MAY 93 / Sale of ECGD offshoot backed


   By JOHN WILLMAN


THE government substantially achieved its objectives when it sold the
short-term insurance business of the Export Credits Guarantee Department to
NCM, the Dutch insurance company, the National Audit Office says in a report
published today, John Willman writes.
The public expenditure watchdog says the sales proceeds of Pounds 20m were
reasonable in the circumstances. The direct expenses - Pounds 6.7m -
reflected its complexity.
The NCM bid was the lower of the two bids received for the sale - the
government was offered Pounds 25m by Generali, the Italian insurer.
