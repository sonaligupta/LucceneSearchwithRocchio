FT  29 APR 94 / International Company News: Profits slip at JCI gold mines

Gold mines in the stable of Johannesburg Consolidated Industries, the South
African mining conglomerate due to be sold off to black investors later this
year, reported a decline in after-tax profit to R52.3m (Dollars 14.6m) in
the March quarter from R72.6m in the preceding three months. The year-ago
figure was R58.8m.
As expected, the drop from the December quarter's good results was largely
due to a failure of a steel drum shaft at the Western Areas mine in January.
However, this loss of production was partly offset by record gold production
at Randfontein Estates and a 2.7 per cent rise in the average gold price
received.
Total revenue from the mines fell to R513.9m, a drop of 1.6 per cent from
the previous quarter's results of R522.4m. Overall ore milled dipped to
2.65m tonnes, from 2.77m tonnes, and overall gold production was down 5.6
per cent to 12,625kg from 13,373kg.
At Western Areas, production declined 20.8 per cent to 3,405kg from 4,300kg
as a result of the accident as the group turned in what management described
as a 'creditable' performance under the circumstances. Nevertheless, a
decision to count the cost of the repairs in the next quarter meant that the
mine still recorded an after-tax profit of R14.3m, down from R40.9m.
In an excellent quarter, Randfontein saw production boosted to a record
8,392kg from 8,187kg, largely on the strength of a higher yield. Successful
cost containment led to bonuses of R5.6m for employees.
The group's HJ Joel operation, which recently announced a R284m rights issue
to help fund capital expenditure, recorded an operating loss of R0.8m
following an operating profit of R0.7m in the December quarter.
