FT  24 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Acquisitive Danka rises 32% to Pounds 7m


   By PEGGY HOLLINGER


STRONG GROWTH in office equipment sales in the US helped Danka Business
Systems, the highly-acquisitive US-based supplier quoted in London, to a 32
per cent advance in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 7m.
The result was struck on sales 36 per cent higher at Pounds 74.2m for the
six months to September 30.
Mr Paul Dumond, company secretary, said Danka had taken a deliberate
decision not to increase the prices of machines such as photocopiers. The
decision had affected gross margins in the retail business, but was expected
to provide a longer-term benefit to the company's service and parts
operation. This latter division provides the majority of the company's
profits,
The retail operation increased gross profits by 47 per cent to Pounds 10.1m,
while service, parts and rental advanced 26 per cent to Pounds 18.1m.
Mr Dumond said plans for a quotation on Nasdaq in the US were expected to
materialise by January. However, no new shares would be issued.
Danka, which has purchased 35 companies in the US since being reversed into
a natural resources shell in 1986, was seeking acquisitions in Europe.
During the first half Danka had spent Dollars 15m (Pounds 9.9m) on six
purchases. He said their contribution in the six months had not been
significant.
The dividend is raised by 0.25p to 1.5p. Earnings advanced 25 per cent to
16.4p.
