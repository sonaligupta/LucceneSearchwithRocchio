FT  05 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: NatWest


The 109 per cent rise in National Westminster's first-half profits from last
year's particularly depressed interim result is as much as the market could
have expected. Bad debt provisions have fallen sharply in both the US and
Australia. Costs are under control. Commission income is up, although not
against last year's second half. Net interest income has registered only a
modest fall, thanks partly to the bank's involvement in fixed rate lending.
Although UK bad debt provisions have fallen only slightly since the second
half of last year, a high charge was always likely, given National
Westminster's high share of small business lending.
None of this means a strong recovery is secure. Operating income is likely
to rise only modestly in spite of an increasing contribution from life
insurance. Nor can one expect anything other than a modest fall in UK bad
debts. It is thus hard to see why the shares have any special attraction.
NatWest has outperformed Barclays by nearly 40 per cent since the start of
the year. But since the latter has fallen harder it may now have further to
recover. On the other hand NatWest cannot boast the same defensive qualities
as Lloyds.
