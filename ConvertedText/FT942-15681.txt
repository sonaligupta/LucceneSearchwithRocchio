FT  14 APR 94 / Impetus grows for working mothers


   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent


Single mothers will have a greater incentive to seek employment by the end
of the decade, according to a survey by the Equal Opportunities Commission.
The activities of the Child Support Agency will increase maintenance
payments to single mothers while reducing their dependence on state
benefits. This will bring tax advantages for those who work, the survey
says.
Women will make up nearly half the labour force by the end of the decade,
with a net growth of 500,000 over the next six years. But the survey adds
that most women will be in low-paid, low-status jobs.
The report shows that women's independent income is half that of men, while
two-thirds of adults in the poorest households are women.
Women are likely to account for 38 per cent of Britain's managers and
administrators, 41 per cent of professionals and 53 per cent of associated
professional and technical workers by 2000.
The survey forecasts no employment growth for ethnic minority women, because
they are likely to seek jobs in decaying industries in inner cities, but
also because of racial and gender discrimination.
