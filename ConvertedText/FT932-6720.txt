FT  27 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Shadow cabinet elections reformed


   By ALISON SMITH


REFORMED arrangements for shadow cabinet elections, including tighter
polling procedures and restrictions on the use of proxy votes, were approved
yesterday at the weekly meeting of Labour MPs, Alison Smith writes.
The changes were recommended by a review committee of MPs set up after a
wave of claims and counter-claims about ballot-rigging last June in the
run-up to the annual elections for 18 shadow cabinet members, the chief whip
and party chairman.
One frontbencher had claimed that on occasion the ballot box containing the
votes of Labour MPs had been opened on the night before the poll closed, and
some MPs had argued that if preliminary results could be discovered, it
would be easy for party power-brokers and campaign managers to fix the
outcome with blank papers.
The report makes no mention of these unsubstantiated rumours but simply says
that the election process has been criticised for being 'slow and
cumbersome'.
Despite the impetus for reform - particularly from the new intake of MPs -
there had been some fears that the move would be opposed by the whips. In
the event, however, the report was accepted unanimously by the 80 or so at
the meeting.
Under the new arrangements, which will come into effect for this autumn's
contest, a polling station will be set up in a Commons committee room. No MP
will be allowed to act as proxy for more than one of his or her colleagues.
Immediately after the close of polling, the ballot papers will be counted in
the presence of scrutineers.
The timetable for any further 'run-off' ballots has been shortened and even
if more than one is needed should now be completed within two weeks.
