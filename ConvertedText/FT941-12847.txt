FT  28 JAN 94 / DTI blunder costs Barnsley dear


   By JOHN AUTHERS


Barnsley, in South Yorkshire, is to lose around Pounds 450,000 from its
provisional standard spending assessment after the Department of Transport
over-estimated the length of its roads, John Authers writes.
Other authorities lost out when the final revenue support grant figures for
local authorities in England were announced by the Department of the
Environment yesterday. Barnsley appears to have lost more than any other
metropolitan authority.
Corrections to mistakes in government data mean that a number of standard
spending assessments have changed since the first announcement in December.
Funds will still be distributed using the principles announced in the
department's consultation paper, which was published last month.
Arrangements to 'cap' the budgets of councils which make what the government
considers to be 'excessive' increases in spending, and to compensate
authorities which will suffer sharp reductions in their spending assessments
compared to last year, also remain unchanged.
