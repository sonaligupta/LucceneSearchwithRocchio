FT  21 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Gartmore European net assets improve


Gartmore European Investment Trust raised net asset value to 99.4p per share
at the end of September 1992, against 94.7p a year earlier,
After-tax revenue fell to Pounds 165,000, against Pounds 384,000 for the
previous 15 months, and earnings per share worked through at 0.97p (2.25p).
The single final dividend is 1.1p (1.6p for 15 months including special
0.5p).
The trust reminded shareholders that its prime objective was to achieve
capital growth over the longer term. Dividend income was therefore of
secondary importance and it might not be possible in future to pursue a
consistent dividend policy.
