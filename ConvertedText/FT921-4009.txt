FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Government Statements): Rise in limit for
qualifying trusts - Personal Equity Plans


THE chancellor proposes to make some changes to Personal Equity Plans
(Peps).
The main points are:
from April 6 1992 it will be possible to invest up to Pounds 6,000 a year in
qualifying unit or investment trusts through a general Pep. The present
limit is Pounds 3,000;
from the same date the annual subscription limit for both new and
established non-qualifying investment trusts will be Pounds 1,500.
Qualifying unit and investment trusts. At present an individual can invest
up to Pounds 6,000 a year in a general Pep, of which up to Pounds 3,000 can
be invested in qualifying unit or investment trusts. A qualifying trust is
one which holds at least half its funds in UK ordinary shares, or comparable
shares in companies incorporated in another EC member state. Where the trust
does not meet that requirement (a non-qualifying trust) only Pounds 1,500
may be invested.
The chancellor proposes to remove the Pounds 3,000 limit from April 6 1992.
An individual will then be able to invest up to Pounds 6,000 a year in a
general Pep in any combination of ordinary shares, qualifying unit or
investment trusts.
New issue non-qualifying investment trusts. A number of new issue investment
trusts have recently been promoted on the basis that they qualified for the
full subscription of Pounds 6,000, in contrast with the lower ceiling for
established investment trusts.
The chancellor proposes that from April 6 1992 the Pep regulations should be
changed to make clear that: the subscription limits are the same for both
new and established investment trusts; and the annual limit on investment
for all non-qualifying trusts is Pounds 1,500.
Other changes. The chancellor also proposes some simplifications to the
administration of Peps. In particular the requirement for plan managers to
obtain fresh application forms on each subscription will be abolished.
