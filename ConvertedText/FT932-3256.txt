FT  15 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Ladbroke interest bill rising


INTEREST COSTS at Ladbroke are continuing to rise, according to Mr Cyril
Stein, chairman of the hotels, racing and property group.
Addressing shareholders at yesterday's annual meeting, Mr Stein blamed the
rise on high interest rates in Europe, a reduction in interest receivable
and the devaluation of sterling.
The group received elections for its enhanced scrip alternative in respect
of just over 1bn shares, representing 92 per cent of the equity.
