FT  23 JUL 93 / Arts: Today's Television


   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY


Today BBC2 gives us another chance to see the 'Timewatch' programme about
the true character of Buffalo Bill (6.30). Then BBC1 offers us another
chance, actually the umpteenth, to see the episode of Dad's Army in which
Sergeant Wilson is to be appointed manager of the bank's Eastgate branch and
made a lieutenant in the Eastgate Home Guard (7.00). At 8.00 there is
another chance to see the episode of Casualty in which a crazed patient
attacks the staff and Ash considers promotion (BBC1).
At 9.00 comes Alas Smith And Jones with the two funny men joining the police
on a siege and 'probing the soft underbelly of the pop world'. This, too, is
'another chance to see', as is the Frank Zappa documentary on BBC2 at 11.20.
If you have broken both legs and simply cannot get out of the house, there
is Blooming Bellamy at 7.30 (BBC1) with the bearded biologist burbling about
herbal medicines; and the first in a new series of All Blacks (8.00 BBC2)
which tries to establish why there are now more black male prostitutes in
central London than white.
