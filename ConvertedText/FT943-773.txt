FT  28 SEP 94 / Concern at Hungary economy


   By VIRGINIA MARSH


   BUDAPEST


The World Bank and International Monetary Fund have written to Hungary's new
government to express concern at the country's poor financial and economic
situation, prime minister Gyula Horn told parliament yesterday. They warned
that the state's high deficit could not be sustained and deep structural
changes were needed in public spending, he said. They believed the slowdown
in reform in the past two years had cost Hungary its advantage as pioneer of
market-led reforms in the 1980s. Mr Horn, who heads a Socialist-dominated
cabinet, said the government would draw up a three-year economic programme,
with the help of the two institutions and the European Union, which would be
presented to parliament by April 1995. He promised to accelerate
privatisation and to limit spending. He urged trade unions and employers to
accept pay constraint.
