FT  28 APR 94 / International Capital Markets: EC may widen derivatives
rules


   By TRACY CORRIGAN


The European Commission may modify its solvency ratio directive so that it
will cover a broader range of derivative instruments.
Mr Paolo Clarotti, head of banking and financial institutions at the
Commission, said the changes 'will increase the charges to banks for
so-called off-balance sheet risk'.
Currently, foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives are covered under
the solvency ratio directive. In the future, equity, metal and other
commodity derivatives may also be covered. In addition, the two levels of
capital required for derivatives maturing in less than or more than one year
are likely to be expanded to three categories: less than one year, one to
five years, and more than five years.
In addition, the scope for netting - which allows banks to offset exposure
to the same counterparty - will be expanded.
The EC solvency ratio directive was issued in July 1988, in conjunction with
the Basle Committee's rulings on solvency ratios.
The Basle Committee is currently working on new rules for market risk, but
this work is likely to take considerably longer to complete. These rules
force banks to set aside capital to cover various types of risk.
Mr Clarotti also said that he would head a working group on derivatives to
be set up by the Commission in June. The group, which will include bankers
from various member states, will look into the risks to the financial
markets posed by derivatives.
