FT  25 MAR 92 / French trade surplus declines


   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

FRANCE's monthly trade surplus narrowed sharply in February, underlining the
extent to which any economic recovery there is dependent on the pattern of
demand in export markets.
Last month's surplus was FFr407m (Pounds 42m), down from FFr3.53bn in
January, said the customs directorate yesterday. Yet this still marks a big
improvement year-on-year, bringing the surplus for the first two months of
1992 to FFr3.9bn, as against a FFr8.7bn deficit in the same period of 1991.
Moreover, France has maintained a FFr7.6bn surplus with the rest of the
European Community for the first two months of the year. This was a good
result, which confirmed the increase in France's competitiveness thanks to
its control of inflation and the costs of production, said the Finance
Ministry.
The main reason for the narrowing of the month-on-month surplus was a sudden
halt in the growth of overseas sales. Exports were roughly stable at
FFr103.8bn last month, while imports to France climbed by 3.2 per cent, from
FFr100.2bn in January to FFr103.4bn in February. The change was most marked
in industrial goods, where France swung into a FFr1.6bn deficit last month,
from a FFr1.4bn surplus in January.
