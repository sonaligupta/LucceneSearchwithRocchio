FT  27 MAY 93 / Solicitors renew legal aid challenge


   By ROBERT RICE


THE Law Society, the solicitors' professional body, yesterday launched the
second of two challenges to government changes in the legal aid scheme,
Robert Rice writes.
The society is seeking a judicial review of the decision by Lord Mackay, the
lord chancellor, to cut legal aid eligibility without following proper
consultation procedures with the society.
The cuts, which came into force on April 12, reduce the qualifying
disposable income limit for free legal aid to income support levels and
increase the contributions paid by others towards their cases.
The society says that on the government's figures 37 per cent of households
 -between 12m and 14m adults - will be affected by the cuts.
The government has predicted that the number of legal aid certificates
issued this year will drop from 410,000 to 287,000. That means 30 per cent
of those who should have received legal aid will be deprived of access to
justice, the society says.
