   By REUTER


   PARIS


Mr Jacques Attali, president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, yesterday attacked the Group of Seven leading industrial
nations over their aid to Russia, Reuter reports from Paris. Of Dollars 24bn
promised at a meeting in Munich last July, none had been disbursed or was
even available. 'International hypocrisy is gigantic,' he told a symposium
at the Sorbonne branch of Paris University.
