FT  15 DEC 94 / Arts: Today's Television


   By MARTIN HOYLE


What is the difference between entertaining eccentricity and tunnel-vision
tedium? Compare tonight's Spirit of Trees at 8.30 on Channel 4 with Witness:
Why East Grinstead? that immediately follows it. In the first, experts drone
on about what could be a beautiful and important topic; in the second the
trivial and dotty are made fascinating. At least in East Grinstead they hug
their trees.
They also caress rocks and dowse all over the place. Suburbia took a bashing
on television earlier this year; this redresses the balance. But not all
suburbs are like East Grinstead. The phenomenon is peculiar: a high
concentration of faddists, sects and genuinely religious in the county that
logically enough gave us Puck of Pook's Hill. A treasurable half-hour of the
gently barking. The preceding tree programme is all bark and no bite.
Communal nuttiness also surfaces in The Vicar of Dibley (8.30 BBC1), the
sitcom about a clergywoman. Fans compare it with Dad's Army but it lacks the
authentic human characteristics of Warmington's Home Guard.
