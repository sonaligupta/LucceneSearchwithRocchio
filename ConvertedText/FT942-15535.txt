FT  14 APR 94 / International Company News: Retail chains focus on Argentina


   By JOHN BARHAM


   BUENOS AIRES


International retail chains are announcing expansion plans in Argentina,
attracted by its rapid economic growth, relatively high incomes and the
absence of a sophisticated retail industry.
French-owned Carrefour said on Tuesday it would paid the local subsidiary of
British American Tobacco Dollars 20m for a 91,000 square metre site in
metropolitan Buenos Aires.
Carrefour is Argentina's leading retailer and already owns seven
hypermarkets there. It is building an eighth in Cordoba. It is expected that
a new Buenos Aires hypermarket will be ready next year.
Wal-Mart of the US was yesterday reported to have paid Argentina's Bunge y
Born industrial and food group Dollars 18m for a prime site in Buenos Aires.
El Cronista Comercial, a business newspaper, said that Wal-Mart took an
option on the site, currently occupied by a textile factory, that will
expire by mid-year.
Yesterday Mr Eduardo Elzstain, president of Buenos Aires-based property
developer IRSA, said a court had rejected legal objections to his company's
development of a hypermarket in the city centre.
Mr Elzstain said he hoped the Dollars 30m Abasto shopping centre project,
which IRSA took over from the failed El Hogar Obrero co-operative chain,
would open in 1996. IRSA is listed on the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange but
its principal shareholder is New York investor Mr George Soros.
