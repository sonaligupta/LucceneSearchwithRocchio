FT  23 JUL 93 / Pakistan devalues rupee 6%

PAKISTAN'S new caretaker government, headed by Mr Moeen Qureshi, a former
World Bank official, yesterday devalued the rupee by 6 per cent in an
attempt to boost exports, writes Farhan Bokhari in Islamabad.
The finance ministry said international currency movements had caused
distortions in Pakistan's trade and the government had determined that a
significant adjustment was required.
The move, which followed a 3 per cent devaluation on July 15, set the
official rate at Rs29.85/29.99 to the dollar. It was welcomed by exporters
and on the Karachi stock market, where textile shares rose in expectations
of improved profits.
The All Pakistan Textile Mills Association, the leading manufacturers'
association, had demanded a devaluation to overcome competition from cheaper
Indian and Chinese exports.
Pakistani export earnings in the financial year which ended on June 30 were
Dollars 6.8bn (Pounds 4.5bn), little changed from Dollars 6.7bn the previous
year but far below the targeted Dollars 8bn.
Mr Mir Afzal Khan, acting president of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers
of Commerce and Industry, said: 'This is a first step in the right
direction. It was badly needed to compete with Indian goods.'
Officials said the impact on prices would not become clear for two or three
months.
