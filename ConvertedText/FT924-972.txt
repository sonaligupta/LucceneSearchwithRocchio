FT  21 DEC 92 / People: Robb joins Aberdeen Petroleum


George Robb, who has just resigned as chairman of Aberdeen Trust, is taking
over the chairmanship of oil and gas producer Aberdeen Petroleum, a
USM-quoted company he helped found in 1981. He succeeds Calum MacLeod, who
has been the company's only chairman to date.
Robb, who remains on the board of Aberdeen Trust, says that Aberdeen
Petroleum 'suffers the problem shared by many small oil companies, namely
that they are perfectly healthy but are just not big enough to generate any
interest among the institutions. One of the challenges for me is to raise
our profile.'
Like Robb, MacLeod, 57, worked at a (different) firm of Aberdeen solicitors
on the investment management side. He has since become a free-lance company
director, among other things chairing Britannia Life as well as being deputy
chairman of Grampian TV. He is stepping down from the oil company, having
been made chairman of the Grampian Health Board.
The company, which is headquartered in London and whose interests are
presently entirely in the US, has recently made an approach to - and been
initially rebuffed by - fellow-USM company Brabant, which is focused in the
UK.
