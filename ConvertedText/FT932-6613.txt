SME, the Italian state-owned foods, retailing and catering group which is to
be sold into the private sector, reports a slight increase in group net
profits after minority interests, to L127.2bn (Dollars 86.1m) last year from
L125.6bn.
Group sales reached L5,850bn against L5,814bn. However, adjusted for
disposals during the year, turnover rose by 8.2 per cent.
The sharpest growth came in food production - the first division to be sold
 -with a 11.9 per cent rise in sales to L2,104bn. Adjusted for takeovers and
disposals, the increase was 6.5 per cent.
Turnover on the catering side, concentrated in the Autogrill subsidiary,
climbed 9.7 per cent to L1,115bn, while food retailing rose 4.8 per cent to
L2,631bn.
SME's earnings rose more sharply at pre-tax level, with a leap to L230.2bn
from L142.2bn in 1991. The company said net earnings had been burdened by
much higher tax payments.
Parent company net profits jumped 27 per cent to L93.2bn from L73.5bn,
largely due to extraordinary gains on the sale of subsidiaries.
