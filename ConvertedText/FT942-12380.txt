FT  29 APR 94 / International Company News: AIG ahead in spite of earthquake


   By PATRICK HARVERSON


   NEW YORK


American International Group, the large US insurer, yesterday reported
modest growth in first-quarter profits, in spite of a big jump in
catastrophe losses from the January earthquake in southern California.
AIG said net income during the quarter totalled Dollars 505.6m, against
Dollars 495.6m in the same period last year. After adjustments for
accounting changes and capital gains the group's underlying income rose 6
per cent over the year to Dollars 480.1m.
Catastrophe losses at AIG reached Dollars 55m, up from Dollars 7.8m a year
earlier. All the losses related to the earthquake, which has become the
second-costliest natural disaster in the history of the US insurance
industry, behind Hurricane Andrew in 1992.
Commenting on market conditions, Mr Maurice Greenberg, AIG's chairman, said
property insurance rates continued to strengthen in the domestic commercial
market, a trend that should be reinforced as the industry absorbs the impact
of the recent earthquake and weather-related catastrophes.
Apart from the impact of the earthquake, AIG's businesses put in a solid
performance. The group's general insurance division recorded earnings of
Dollars 349.5m, down slightly from Dollars 351.8m a year ago but up 12.5 per
cent if the catastrophe business is excluded. Life insurance earnings
climbed 18 per cent to Dollars 194.4m, and financial services posted
operating income of Dollars 97.1m, up 13 per cent from a year earlier.
USF&G, another big insurer, also reported higher catastrophe losses in its
quarterly results yesterday, partly from the earthquake and partly from the
severe winter storms that swept large parts of the US during the quarter.
First-quarter net income was Dollars 23m, down from Dollars 61m a year
earlier, although those results included a one-time gain of Dollars 38m
related to the adoption of new accounting standards.
Catastrophe losses totalled Dollars 40m, Dollars 10m of which was the
California earthquake with the remainder being winter storms. Even with the
losses, USF&G was able to post income of Dollars 33m on its
property/casualty business, down from Dollars 40m a year ago.
