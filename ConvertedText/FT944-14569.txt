FT  22 OCT 94 / BCCI head denies state charges


   By REUTER


   NEW YORK


The former head of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, sentenced
to federal imprisonment this week for bank fraud, pleaded not guilty
yesterday to related state charges. Swaleh Naqvi admitted the federal
charges and was sentenced on Wednesday to more than eight years in prison
and ordered to pay Dollars 255.4m in restitution. He pleaded not guilty to a
New York indictment dating back to 1992. His court-appointed lawyer, Mr
Brian Barrett, would not comment on whether Naqvi was negotiating with state
prosecutor Robert Morgenthau's office. Mr Morgenthau strongly criticised the
federal plea agreement as being too lenient.
