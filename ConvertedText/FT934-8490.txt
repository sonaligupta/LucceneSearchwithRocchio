FT  15 NOV 93 / World News in Brief: European Monetary System


The Dutch guilder remains the strongest currency in the system although the
gap between it and the Danish krone, the grid's weakest member, narrowed
last week to 4.77 per cent from 4.95 per cent. The Portuguese escudo moved
ahead of the French franc into sixth place in the grid after dealers
reported central-bank intervention.
