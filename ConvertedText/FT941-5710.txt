FT  04 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cobalt output cut in 1993 by 22
per cent


   By REUTER


Production of cobalt by major western world producers fell to 13,843 tonnes
in 1993 from 17,891 tonnes in 1992 according to Cobalt Development Institute
statistics being circulated among London by trade houses, reports Reuter.
The reduction was caused mainly by a sharp reduction in output at Zaire's
Gecamines and came as no surprise to traders given the political turmoil and
economic neglect in that country over recent years.
Output also dropped in neighbouring Zambia, the CDI statistics show, which
traders expected after hearing reports of lower ore grades being encountered
in the latter part of 1993.
Canada's Sherritt Gordon increased output by 78 per cent to 1,218 tonnes but
most other producers showed little change.
