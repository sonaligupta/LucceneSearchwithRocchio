FT  08 NOV 94 / World Trade News: VW launches Taiwan plant - Contracts and
Ventures


   By LAURA TYSON


   TAIPEI


Volkswagen, the German car maker, yesterday launched a new production
facility in Taiwan. By 1996 the assembly plant will reach capacity of 30,000
light commercial vehicles per year, of which 20,000 will be sold in Taiwan
and the rest exported to south-east Asia and, later, China.
The new company, Chinchun Motor, is a joint venture with Chinfon Global, a
Taiwanese industrial group with interests in manufacturing, construction and
banking. Volkswagen will provide technology and expertise and Chinfon the
facilities, management and administration. The products will be marketed
jointly. Chinfon holds 66.6 per cent of the paid-in capital of DM190m
(Dollars 127.5m) and Volkswagen holds the rest.
The Taiwan site may be expanded to produce 150,000 cars a year depending on
cross-strait political developments and China's smooth accession to Gatt. It
is hoped that eventually more sophisticated parts made in Taiwan may be
exported to supply Volkswagen's plants in China and completed engines made
in China will be brought to Taiwan to install in the Taiwan-made vehicles.
Taiwan requires that 50 per cent of parts be locally sourced.
