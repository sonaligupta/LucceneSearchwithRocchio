FT  17 JAN 92 / Letter: Completing argument on effect of rising interest
rates on recovery


   From Sir ALAN WALTERS


Sir, I am happy to see that, although Mr Samuel Brittan does not appear to
believe that high and rising real interest can negate a recovery (Economic
Viewpoint, January 9), Lex (January 15) apparently does. Lex, however, fails
to complete the argument. He says that until the Bundesbank starts cutting
rates '. . . declining inflation in the UK will simply mean higher interest
real rates'.
But this is only the beginning of the process. And it is only just beginning
to get interesting. Higher real interest rates will depress monetary growth
(or, for non-monetarists, will reduce aggregate demand) and so result in yet
more rapid deflation. This increased deflation will, of course, increase
real interest rates yet again, and so result in an even steeper fall in
prices. And so on.
This process cannot go on for ever. Apart from unthinkable things such as
exchange controls, the exchange rate peg would have to be abandoned or, more
conventionally to stay within the terms of the ERM, there would have to be a
realignment of the sterling/D-Mark rate. Traders would anticipate a
revaluation of the pound against the D-Mark. (Incidentally, those who argue
that the source of all inflations/deflations is the exchange rate will
conclude that this move would exacerbate the deflation in the UK.) An
anticipated revaluation would bring nominal sterling interest rates down
below those in Germany. At last the interest rate moves in the appropriate
direction] But once the suitable large revaluation of sterling had occurred,
we would be on the same deflationary path again.
Of course something will turn up . . . it always does. Doesn't it?
