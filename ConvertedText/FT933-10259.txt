FT  05 AUG 93 / Mental patient rules to be tightened


   By ALAN PIKE


THE GOVERNMENT will announce a tightening of arrangements for discharging
potentially dangerous patients from mental hospitals next week, Alan Pike
writes.
Pressure on the government to act has been intensified by public concern
over killings and other violent incidents involving discharged patients.
Ministers are expected to produce a package of changes, including the
appointment of social workers with specific responsibility for released
patients.
The measures will be designed to offer greater protection to both mentally
ill people and the public. About Pounds 2bn a year is spent on services for
the mentally ill. An increasing proportion of this has been devoted to
community-based services but mental health organisations say still more is
required to provide adequate services for the numbers of patients now being
released.
The government's community care reforms, designed to enable the elderly and
people with handicaps to live in the community, started in April. Ministers
are aware that the the reforms' credibility could be jeopardised by
continued acts of violence involving former mental patients.
