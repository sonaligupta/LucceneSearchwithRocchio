FT  02 NOV 93 / International Company News: Alcan Aluminium plans further
round of cuts


   By ROBERT GIBBENS


ALCAN Aluminium, facing the deepest and longest post-war recession in ingot
and fabricated products prices, will become smaller and leaner, warns Mr
Jacques Bougie, president and now chief executive.
Alcan's downstream businesses must 'demonstrate clear potential' if they are
to get further investment, Mr Bougie said in the company's internal
magazine.
Mr Bougie suggested that a new round of cuts will focus on Alcan affiliates
making end products. Those that do not measure up or lack a sound profitable
future will be sold.
The group will concentrate on primary smelting and sheet and fabricated
products and is seeking to lower its alumina costs further. It has already
introduced cuts at its Irish alumina plant, near Shannon. Alumina is derived
from processing bauxite and becomes a white powder and the primary material
in aluminium smelting.
Alcan has 49,000 employees worldwide, down from nearly 70,000 nearly a
decade ago. It operates more than 20 units making a wide variety of
aluminium products, used mainly in construction and transportation and
including cable. Some periphery units have already been sold.
The company has cut about USDollars 500m from its cost base, mainly in North
America, in its struggle to become a low cost producer, and effective
yesterday realigned its main business groups. It recently received a large
US consultants' study of its worldwide organisation.
