FT  15 JUN 93 / Business failure rate 'static'


   By ANDREW JACK


THE NUMBER of business failures was the same in the first quarter of this
year as in the final months of last year, figures released yesterday by
trade credit insurer Trade Indemnity show, Andrew Jack writes.
Failures and bad debts notified to the company were 1,767 in the three
months to March, down 15 per cent from the first quarter of last year.
The figures support other recent statistics suggesting that the worst of the
recession may be over, or that banks are holding back from appointing
receivers.
The company said late payment and bad debt continued to be damaging and
their extent was underestimated by many companies.
Year-on-year, business failures declined in all regions of the UK except
Scotland and northern and north-western England.
