FT  29 JAN 92 / World Trade News: EBRD drops loan curbs on ex-Soviet
republics


   By JUDY DEMPSEY


THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is dropping
lending curbs on the former Soviet Union after economic reform pledges by
most of the new republics, Judy Dempsey reports.
The EBRD will now be able to exceed loans equivalent to an annual Ecus 36m
(Pounds 25.7m). This was supposed to match the former Soviet Union's annual
contribution, which was expected over five years to provide Dollars 200m to
the EBRD's subscribed capital, and would amount to one-third of the Soviet
Union's long-term commitment of Dollars 600m.
'But now that six republics (apart from the Baltic states) have applied to
join the EBRD, we had to revise our restrictions on lending,' an official
said yesterday. Russia, the Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Uzbekistan and
Tajikistan were seeking membership.
EBRD lending curbs on Moscow, largely at the insistence of the US, the
biggest single shareholder, were for three years. Despite pressure from west
European governments to increase the ceiling, the US wanted the EBRD to
concentrate on lending to the fledgling private sector, rather than Soviet
state-run projects.
