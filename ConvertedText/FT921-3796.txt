FT  12 MAR 92 / Compensation fund for air travellers


scheme for the scheduled services of UK airlines which go out of business
was announced yesterday by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, transport secretary.
He said it would be financed by a small levy on airlines which would work

Until now, passengers on scheduled flights have not been covered against
airline collapse as package holidaymakers are.
