FT  19 APR 94 / Mexico's PRI still favoured


   By REUTER


   MEXICO CITY


A poll published in the state-owned El Nacional newspaper this week showed
the Mexican ruling party's presidential candidate leading by a wide margin,
backed by nearly a third of those surveyed, Reuter reports from Mexico City.
The poll showed Mr Ernesto Zedillo, the new candidate of the Institutional
Revolutionary party (PRI) since last month's assassination of Mr Luis
Donaldo Colosio, was favoured by 32 per cent of the 1,100 people surveyed.
The presidential candidate for the left-leaning Democratic Revolutionary
party, Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, was supported by 12 per cent while Mr Diego
Fernandez de Cevallos, conservative National Action party candidate, was
favoured by 10 per cent of those surveyed.
The figures show a slight dip in the popularity of the PRI candidate since
Mr Colosio was shot dead on March 23 while campaigning in the northern city
of Tijuana.
