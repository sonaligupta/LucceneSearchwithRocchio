FT  28 MAR 92 / Election 1992: End of boom - Ballot Box


For the business community of Swindon, one of Britain's archetypal 1980s
boom towns, Labour's plans for a national minimum wage and increased taxes
on higher incomes seem to be causing few palpitations. A question-and-answer
lunch debate with election candidates and the local chamber of commerce
produced not one hostile question to the Labour challenger Jim D'Avila, a
bearded Rover toolmaker.
Nick Davies, the chamber's president, said he was surprised nobody brought
up the tax issue. A bigger surprise, however, was that Simon Coombs, the
incumbent Tory MP, failed to turn up. He sent an apology saying that he had
an election to fight.
