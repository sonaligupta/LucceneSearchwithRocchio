FT  27 JAN 94 / Observer: Digging for gold


Britain's Department of Transport seems oblivious to all the talk in
Whitehall about looking after taxpayers' money and maintaining a tighter
grip on the government's finances.
When Labour MP John Spellar asked about the cost to the taxpayer of the
government's decision to extend Eurotunnel's concession by 10 years, he got
a dusty answer. Transport secretary John MacGregor said he could not
estimate it 'with any precision'.
Eurotunnel clearly thought the extension represented serious money in the
bank and is likely to quantify it in its forthcoming rights issue
prospectus. In the meantime, Warburg Securities, Eurotunnel's broker, has
publicly estimated that the extension has added around Pounds 300m to the
value of the project.
No reason why the taxpayer shouldn't be told.
