FT  22 DEC 92 / IFC criticised over dam

Environmental groups reacted with dismay yesterday at the decision of the
International Finance Corporation, the World Bank's private sector arm, to
finance a Dollars 500m hydroelectric dam on the upper reaches of Chile's
biggest river, the Bio Bio, writes Leslie Crawford in Santiago.
The 450MW Pangue dam is scheduled to come on stream in 1997, when it will
supply 12 per cent of Chile's total energy needs. It is being built by
Endesa, a privatised utility.
The Bio Bio Action Group, a coalition of US and Chilean ecologists, said the
IFC loan 'violated all the World Bank's environmental guidelines'.
It was particularly critical of the IFC's decision to back the project while
studies on the downstream impact of the dam were pending.
In Washington, an IFC spokesman said the corporation was confident further
work would mitigate the power station's effect on the water levels of the
Bio Bio.
