FT  17 JAN 92 / Observer: Musical chairs


The reshuffle of finance directors at NatWest and TSB is all rather odd.
Why should a well-respected NatWest veteran like John Burns want to defect
to a group less than half NatWest's size when he is only four years from
retirement? Presumably Burns is privy to NatWest's innermost strategic
secrets, so why allow him to take them to an arch competitor?
It looks far too cosy and once again raises questions about just how
competitive British banks really are. Burns was not talking yesterday, so
the market will have to draw its own conclusions.
Of the two banks, NatWest seems to be taking the bigger risk in the finance
chief it has decided to import. Although good British finance directors are
hardly in short supply, it has chosen someone from not only a different
industry but another country - and presumably at a salary that at least some
of his indigenous colleagues will resent.
It might be that the 49-year-old Richard Goeltz is just what's needed to
shake up NatWest's inbred culture. But the record of similar moves is less
than encouraging. Midland Bank is on its third outside finance director and
so far there's little improvement in its fortunes. Meanwhile, Lloyds Bank,
the most successful clearer, seems to have done very well without a finance
director on its board.
