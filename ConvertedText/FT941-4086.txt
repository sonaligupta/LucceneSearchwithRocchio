FT  12 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Wimpey cheer - The Week Ahead


Wimpey, the housebuilder which announces on Tuesday, has substantially
increased volume sales and will also benefit from improved margins. The
company, which in 1992 made a Pounds 112m pre-tax loss after provisions of
Pounds 113.8m, could have made a profit of about Pounds 30m last year.
English China Clays' results on Monday are likely to show a drop from Pounds
100.2m in 1992 to about Pounds 85m in 1993, including about Pounds 15m to
Pounds 20m of land sales.
Williams Holdings is expected to report annual pre-tax profits of Pounds
153m (Pounds 161m), after a Pounds 17m goodwill charge on the disposal of
the engineering businesses. Williams watchers will want indications on the
future of the electronics division, earmarked for eventual disposal.
When United Biscuits announces its full-year figures on Thursday, the chief
uncertainty is how much UB will write off in closures and restructuring at
its struggling US subsidiary, Keebler.
However, it seems that profits will be down not only in the US, but in the
UK as well. A best guess for pre-tax profit is around Pounds 170m (Pounds
162m). This allows only for exceptional events already announced. In other
words, underlying profits may be down.
Guinness, reporting on Thursday,expects pre-tax profits of Pounds 905m,
compared with an underlying Pounds 920m the year before. From that will be
deducted a Pounds 30m charge for UK pensions and a largely non-cash charge
of Pounds 173m on the LVMH transaction, leaving Pounds 702m.
Reed Elsevier, the Anglo-Dutch publishing group, will announce on Thursday
its first full-year results since the merger. Analysts are forecasting
pre-tax profits of Pounds 530m.
Rentokil, the environmental and property services group, is expected to
maintain its record of 20 per cent compound growth by reporting annual
profits of about Pounds 147m on Thursday. Analysts will want a progress
report on Securiguard, the security and cleaning company which Rentokil
bought for Pounds 76m last July after a hostile takeover battle.
Legal & General, the life and composite insurer, will announce its results
on Thursday. Analysts are expecting pre-tax profits to rise to about Pounds
175m, after Pounds 116m in 1992.
