FT  08 JUN 92 / Letter: Training in UK needs to be formalised


   From W J GOLDFINCH


Sir, Sir John Cassels admirably explains (Personal View, June 2) why so few
16- to 18-year-olds benefit from education and training on a par with
Britain's competitors. Our 'system' works against the grain of human nature.
Sir John's solution works with it.
As he says, all 16- to 19-year-olds' further education has to be
state-funded and the cost of trainees' pay or, preferably, allowances, has
to be balanced by the value of the trainee's output. In the interests of the
trainee, there should be a formal training contract, culminating in a
nationally recognised qualification.
Employers need to be involved to ensure the quality of craft-technician
level vocational programmes remains ahead of our competitors. There is a
danger it will not, as more young people remain in full-time education,
unless a market system as described by Sir John is created.
The Engineering Employers' Federation has been campaigning for such changes.
Early Youth Training Scheme policy was establishing the right attitudes,
funding, training contracts and trainee allowances. Regrettably, the
essential national qualification and quality control system was not then in
place. A critical first move would be for the government to reinstate those
early policies and use training credits as the funding mechanisms.
