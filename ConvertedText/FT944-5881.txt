FT  01 DEC 94 / UK Company News: North of England helps Wainhomes to Pounds
5.28m


   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent


Wainhomes, the Chester-based house builder which came to the market in
spring, increased interim pre-tax profits by almost half to Pounds 5.28m,
compared with Pounds 3.54m.
The company's share price, up 1p at 131p, remains more than a fifth below
its issue price of 170p.
Turnover rose by 36 per cent to Pounds 48.6m (Pounds 35.8m) for the six
months to the end of September. The company completed a record 682 sales
compared with 502 for the same period last year.
The bulk of the increase had been achieved by the businesses in north-west
England and Yorkshire. Its operation in southern England nonetheless
contributed almost a fifth of operating profits with the region enjoying
'its most successful trading period to date'.
The group also reported its first sales in the Midlands where it has only
recently expanded.
Mr Ron Smith, chief executive, was cautious about the outlook for prices:
'In the north-west, which accounts for the majority of our business, prices
have been and remain under pressure.'
This pressure, however, had been offset by overhead and marketing economies
of scale. Average house prices across the group's businesses in the first
half were similar to last year's level. Operating margins improved slightly
from 10.2 per cent to 10.4 per cent.
Mr Smith said changes in product mix were expected to increase average
selling prices in the second half.
Wainhomes is paying an interim dividend of 1.5p out of earnings per share of
5.7p (5.4p).
At the end of September, the group had Pounds 8.7m cash having increased the
number of housing plots under its control to just under 3,200 compared with
2,300 in September 1993. It expects the number of homes sold annually to
rise by about 500 to at least 1,800 within three years.
Brokers' forecasts suggest the company will make more than Pounds 10m
pre-tax profit this year compared with Pounds 6.23m in 1993-94.
