FT  27 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Densitron shares hit by warning


Shares in Densitron Inter-national fell 5p to 35p after the electronic
components group warned that a delay in some main contracts meant that full
year profits were unlikely to match the previous year's Pounds 1.01m
pre-tax.
The company said that sales were strong in Europe and in Asia, but declined
in the US. There was a strong recovery in the microwave division which was
now profitable.
