FT  12 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Airtours raids Owners


   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON


The battle for control of Owners Abroad, Britain's second biggest holiday
tour operator, grew more heated as its smaller rival Airtours, which is
seeking to acquire Owners, picked up just over 4 per cent of the equity at
an average of 144p a share. Dealers said that Airtours' joint broker BZW had
been attempting to buy around 10 per cent of Owners shares, although a
spokesman for Airtours refused to confirm this. Owners shares closed 1 1/2
better at 141p in turnover of 13m. Airtours climbed 4 to 333p.
Rumours suggested further spice could be added to the takeover battle today
with the announcement by one leading institution over which side it will
support. Owners claimed yesterday that summer bookings were good, but
Airtours hand was further strengthened when Paribas became the latest broker
to support its Pounds 290m bid, joining Smith New Court, Hoare Govett and
Panmure Gordon.
