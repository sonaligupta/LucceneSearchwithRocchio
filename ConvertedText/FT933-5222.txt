FT  04 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Burford advances 40% to Pounds 1.93m


Burford Holdings, the property investor and trader, returned pre-tax profits
of Pounds 1.93m for the six months to end-June, a near-40 per cent
improvement over last time's Pounds 1.38m.
Turnover of Pounds 5.1m compared with Pounds 4.6m. Earnings emerged at 1.27p
(0.68p) and the interim dividend is lifted to 0.65p (0.5p).
Mr Nigel Wray, chairman, said the figures did not incorporate any
contribution from the Pounds 68m property portfolio acquired from Provident
Mutual or from the recent Pounds 41.9m rights issue launched to help fund
the purchase. He said the benefits of these transactions would be seen in
the second half.
It was anticipated that by the year end the rent roll should be annualising
at about Pounds 17m.
