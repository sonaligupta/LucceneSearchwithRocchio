FT  14 APR 94 / CBI backs insolvency law move


   By JENNY LUESBY


The Confederation of British Industry yesterday said 500 companies could be
saved each year if insolvency laws were revised, Jenny Luesby writes.
Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, backed the government's aim of
introducing a more flexible insolvency procedure, saying 'every possible
step' should be taken to keep good companies afloat.
'The economy cannot afford to lose firms which a more sympathetic approach
would save,' he said.
The DTI has suggested that companies should be able to declare a moratorium
for 28 days while they tried to arrange creditor terms for at least 75 per
cent of their debts.
The CBI backed the idea of a moratorium, but suggested that companies should
be able to extend the initial 28 days to a period of up to six months,
rather than the maximum three months proposed by the DTI.
