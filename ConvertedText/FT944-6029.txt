FT  01 DEC 94 / Japan's industrial output falls


   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

The Japanese economy is in the early stage of a below-par recovery, as shown
yesterday by a larger than expected decline in industrial production in
October. Output fell by 0.3 per cent from September, the second month of
decline, as a result of a temporary build-up of unsold stocks as demand fell
back from a summer spurt. Production was up by 0.7 per cent on average when
taken over the three months to October.
That puts output on track to rise by 1.1 per cent this calender year, based
on estimates by the ministry of international trade and industry. If
achieved, this would be the first annual rise since 1991, when production
went up by 1.7 per cent. One encouraging sign is that stocks of unsold goods
and materials started to fall back again in October, by 0.1 per cent from
the previous month, or down 4.7 per cent year-on-year.
