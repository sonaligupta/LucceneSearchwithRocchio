McDonald's, the world's leading fast-food company, is offering an innovative
programme to attract and retain small investors, writes Barbara Durr.
Under the programme, shareholders who own less than 50 shares will be able
to purchase additional shares, sell them or donate their shares to selected
charities without paying brokerage commissions. The initial offering period
for the programme will be 30 days.
McDonald's will also match donations equivalent to the value of all shares
donated, up to a combined maximum of Dollars 100,000. At the end of 1991,
McDonald's had 372,000 shareholders.
