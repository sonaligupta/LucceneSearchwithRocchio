FT  27 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading


   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE


VOLATILE trading left the futures market slightly firmer in an otherwise
featureless session, with political pressures for once pushed to the
background, writes Christopher Price.
The March FT-SE future opened at 2,469 and was quickly squeezed up to 2,474,
but aggressive selling by, among others, Goldman Sachs and UBS Phillips &
Drew then pushed it down to 2,460, and the rest of the morning trading was
at a discount to the cash market. However, an expectation that Wall Street
would be corrected up after a reported mistake by Salomon Brothers had
knocked the Dow Jones Industrial index overnight, helped March to rally by
early afternoon to 2,472.
There was steady business in a tight 2,468-72 trading range for most of the
afternoon, before a move to sell, largely by independent traders, sent March
lower. It closed at 2,466, one point up on the previous session but at a
discount to the cash market of around 5. Volume came to 6,339 lots.
In the LTOM, volume of 27,925, up on Wednesday's 24,916 that had been
incorrectly reported, included 10,699 FT-SE 100 contracts. Lasmo was the
busiest stock option on 2,860 contracts, followed by Prudential on 1,546.
