FT  20 JUL 94 / International Company News: Ifi plunges into loss of L285bn
for year

   ROME


Ifi, the financial holding group of the Agnelli family, recorded a L285bn
(Dollars 184m) loss on its consolidated balance sheet in 1993 compared with
profits of L2,389bn in the previous year.
A company statement attributed the sharp swing to a consolidated loss
primarily to the troubled performance of Fiat, the automotive group in which
the Agnellis still retain part of their stake through Ifi.
In 1993 Fiat suffered a net loss of L1,783bn and the group was obliged to
pass over a dividend payment on ordinary shares for the first time since
1947.
The non-consolidated balance sheet was also affected by the Fiat group's
performance, the company said. The 1993 profit was down to L110.2bn from
L151.2bn.
At the Ifi annual meeting on September 30, the board will be proposing a
L270 dividend for privileged shares reduced from L365.
For ordinary shares the dividend will be cut to L220 from L315.
