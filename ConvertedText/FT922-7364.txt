FT  19 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Activity in management
buy-outs set to rise in UK


   By SARA WEBB


MANAGEMENT buy-out (MBO) activity in the UK is set to increase, helped by
renewed confidence in the economy, last month's re-election of a
Conservative government and the more realistic prices at which managers can
now buy their own businesses.
Some leading UK banks say MBO-related lending started to pick up about six
months ago, and they expect activity to increase now that the general
election is out of the way.
According to 3i, the venture capital group, MBOs worth about Pounds 580m
took place in the first quarter of 1992, although the level of activity is
well below that seen in the 1980s. 3i reported 71 MBOs in 1989, but the
level fell to 44 in 1991 as recession and slow bank lending checked
activity.
However, the latest wave of MBOs differs in one important respect from the
wave of deals done in the late 1980s - they are less highly-geared, with
bankers now eager to limit the debt side of the deal to about 50 per cent of
the total value.
In the 1980s, debt repayments and servicing costs represented a huge outflow
of cash. But with debt-equity levels closer to 50-50, the servicing costs
are more manageable, says the Bank of Scotland. The equity portion in such
MBOs is usually provided by the management or venture capital funds.
Bankers report a stream of potential medium-sized MBOs in the pipeline at
present, following deals such as the Pounds 74m buy-out of the Herald
(formerly the Glasgow Herald), the Pounds 200m buy-out of the Bristow
Helicopter Group, and the Pounds 125m total funding for the buy-out of
Midland Newspapers.
In each of these cases, the debt portion represented 50 per cent or less of
the total value of the deal. However, interest margins are nearly double
their previous levels,reflecting the general rise in bank lending margins
over the last two or three years.
Bankers say that deals which would previously have paid margins of about
125-150 basis points over the London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor) now tend
to command margins of between 212-225 basis points over Libor.
