FT  21 APR 94 / Peru human rights warning

Peru's national human rights co-ordinating committee, the Coordinadora, has
warned that violence, human rights abuses and 'scorched earth' tactics seem
poised to re-surface in the country's anti-guerrilla campaign.
The warning came as the Peruvian army mounted what some commentators predict
will be the last big offensive in a 14-year war against the Sendero Luminoso
guerrilla movement. For two weeks, airborne troops have strafed hamlets on
the west bank of the Huallaga river, 40 miles from Tingo Maria, where some
of Sendero's last remaining battalions are reported to be dug in.
The Coordinadora alleges there has been 'indiscriminate aggression against
the civilian population' in the zone.
It says numerous witnesses have reported army bombardments of civilian
targets, burning of houses, rape and torture. The number of dead is thought
to be 'alarmingly high' and reports include the sighting of a single group
of 40 corpses.
The Coordinadora says access to the zone has been denied to impartial
observers, including the International Committee of the Red Cross.
An army source, meanwhile, said the operation had dislodged two of the three
Sendero battalions. He claimed the zone was no longer inhabited by
civilians, but admitted several children living in the guerrilla encampments
had been among the '30 or so' killed during armed attacks.
Other violent incidents condemned by the Coordinadora's report were the
April 16 massacre by Sendero Luminoso of 18 natives and settlers in the
eastern jungle province of Mazamari, and the killing by an army patrol of
eight peasants in Leoncio Prado province on April 11.
