FT  30 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Revenue's own goal - David Cohen
explains how taxpayers can profit


   By DAVID COHEN


Crossing swords with the Inland Revenue can often feel like playing for your
local park team against Manchester United. But an admission last week from
its chairman, Sir Anthony Battishill, confirms that even the taxmen can
score an own goal. Alert taxpayers may be able to take advantage.
The chance to save money arises if your inspector of taxes fails to make
'proper and timely use' of financial information you have given him. If his
lethargy lingers for more than a tax year, and lulls you into believing you
owe no tax, when he finally does wake up you might be able to boot his tax
demand into touch when, finally, it shows up.
The proportion of the bill to be written off depends on the taxpayer's
income bracket; people earning no more than Pounds 15,500 a year per annum
pay nothing while anyone on more than Pounds 40,000 will get no relief at
all (for in-between incomes, see table).
Sir Anthony 's statement promised a let-off for people who had failed in
good faith to declare they were getting state pensions and now face
unexpected demands for arrears.
The Revenue was told about these pensions by the Department of Social
Security. On Tuesday this week, a press release announced that, from now on,
relief will extend to cases in which information is made available by the
DSS rather than by the taxpayer or his employer.
Whether or not a pensioner, a taxpayer will qualify for a rebate only if he
genuinely believes his position is up-to-date. But because the whole idea of
waiving tax arrears has no statutory basis and is merely a 'concession,' it
is the Revenue itself which must be persuaded of the individual's bona
fides.
So, there is little point in arguing if the decision goes against you - the
opposition is also the referee.
A taxpayer will be playing on firmer ground if, instead of paying too little
tax, he has paid too much. When the Revenue gets round to returning the
excess amount, it might be obliged to add a 'repayment supplement.'
Generally, the right to a supplement will not start until 12 months after
the end of the fiscal year in which the liability arose. It will then be
payable for the period from the starting date until the fifth day of the
month following the month in which the surplus tax is repaid.
Suppose, for example, that an overpayment of tax for the year to April 5
1992 was repaid in February 1994. The supplement period would have run from
April 5 1993 to March 5 1994.
With effect from 6 April 1996, however, the timing rules will change in
taxpayers' favour. As part of a drive general to simplify simplification of
personal taxation, the repayment period will run from the date on which the
tax becomes payable (or, if later, the date it is actually paid) until the
repayment date.
The supplement is calculated on the basis of a rate of interest fixed by the
Revenue and adjusted from time to time to keep it broadly in line with
market rates. The present current rate is 5.5 per cent, and it is tax-free.
Until last April, no supplement was payable unless at least Pounds 25 of tax
was repaid, but this threshold has now been abolished.
These rules apply both to income tax - whether paid by an individual
personally or by an employer through the Paye system on behalf of an
employee - and to capital gains tax.
Although CGT does not become payable until the December following the tax
year in which the gains are realised, the supplement period is linked to the
year for which the tax is charged, rather than the year in which it is
payable. Hence, CGT for 1992/93, overpaid in December 1993, will attract a
supplement if not repaid by April 5 1994.
If you are fortunate enough - or perhaps stupid enough - to get a repayment
supplement, you should check carefully that it is the correct amount.
Anyone who has been short-changed will know what to do but, equally, a
taxpayer who realises the repayment is excessive but keeps quiet could be
committing a crime.
