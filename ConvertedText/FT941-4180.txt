FT  12 MAR 94 / O'Reilly pledges Independent funds


Mr Tony O'Reilly's Independent Newspapers of Ireland promised yesterday that
it would provide funding for Newspaper Publishing, owners of The Independent
and Independent on Sunday, if a takeover bid by a consortium which includes
Mirror Group Newspapers was referred to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
The move - with the group saying that it would provide finance in line with
its 29.9 per cent stake in Newspaper Publishing - is designed to remove any
possible danger of insolvency at the newspaper.
