FT  11 APR 94 / Observer: Soft at heart


It's not quite in the same league as the death of the Malboro man. But
Rowntree's decision to take its Yorkie chocolate bar truck driver off the
road after 17 years in advertising is a reminder that the knights of the
road don't have the pulling power that they once did. J Walter Thompson,
which handles the adverts, is replacing the macho trucker with a
Fugitive-style escaped prisoner 'tough enough to eat Yorkies'. Presumably
this means the end of the lorry sticker 'No hand signals. Driver eating
Yorkie'.
