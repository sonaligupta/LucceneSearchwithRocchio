FT  09 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Dixons


Yesterday's 7 per cent jump in Dixons' share price in response to decidedly
poor interim figures is understandable enough. A market starved of good news
from retailers was bound to welcome a 72 per cent rise in UK retailing
profits and talk of an excellent Christmas. Never mind that the increase was
achieved without help from the market place and on a mere 2 per cent
increase in like-for-like volume. Never mind either that it was more than
offset by a dreadful Pounds 11m loss in the US. In the four years since
Dixons hit trouble, the market has always tended to give it the benefit of
the doubt.
There is nevertheless room for irritation with a company which, while
sending in its UK retail team to tackle the mess of a four-year-old US
acquisition, talks blithely of acquiring its way into continental Europe
within the next year or two. The market has generally assumed that because
Dixons was the first retailer into the downturn, it will be the first out.
Yesterday's UK results perhaps confirm that. But it is worth recalling that
even if full year profits for 1992-3 were to rebound smartly to some Pounds
100m - putting the shares on a prospective multiple of 14 - they would only
have returned to their plateau of 1986-88.
