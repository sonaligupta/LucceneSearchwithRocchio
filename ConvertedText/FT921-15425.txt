FT  10 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Clarke Foods Pounds 7m rights


   By PEGGY HOLLINGER


CLARKE FOODS, the invest-ment company turned ice cream manufacturer headed
by US businessman Mr Henry Clarke, will today announce a rights issue to
raise some Pounds 7m to help pay for the acquisition of Lyons Maid from
Allied-Lyons, the food and brewing group.
The purchase of Lyons Maid - believed to be for some Pounds 12m - will
propel Clarke into Britain's number two ice cream manufacturing slot, after
Unilever. Clarke will also pay for Lyons with cash and a Pounds 3m term
loan.
The cash call is expected to be pitched at a price modestly above the
share's suspension price of 54p. The group said that trading in its
USM-quoted shares - which have been suspended pending completion of the
Lyons deal - would be resumed today.
Clarke also announced pre-tax profits for the year to October 31 25 per cent
ahead to Pounds 1.13m on sales of Pounds 11.2m. Earnings rose from 4.7p to
5.7p and the final dividend is 1.5p (1.25p), for a total of 2.25p (2p).
