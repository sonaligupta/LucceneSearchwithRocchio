FT  12 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Lloyds Chemists surges 48% to Pounds 23m


   By JANE FULLER


LLOYDS CHEMISTS, the acquisitive retailer and healthcare wholesaler,
increased pre-tax profits by 48 per cent, from Pounds 15.2m to Pounds 22.6m,
in the six months to December 31.
Turnover jumped 81 per cent to Pounds 394.7m (Pounds 218.4m), boosted by the
Pounds 99m Macarthy acquisition, completed a year ago, and rapid growth of
the Barclay Enterprise wholesaler.
Extra shares in issue following the Macarthy deal slowed the advance in
earnings per share to 16 per cent at 12.4p (10.68p).
Mr Allen Lloyd, who recently split his chairman-chief executive role, giving
the latter to his brother Peter, said group turnover had already surpassed
the Pounds 509.4m made in 1991-92.
The chemist division, which has 869 stores, increased sales to Pounds 210.2m
(Pounds 143.1m) in the first half. Most of this came from acquisition;
like-for-like growth was 4 per cent.
Margins were eroded by the NHS-imposed cut in generic drug prices, costing
between Pounds 2m and Pounds 3m in profit.
The most rapid growth came from Barclay Enterprise, which Mr Lloyd said was
now third in the wholesale market behind AAH and UniChem. Turnover in the
wholesale and manufacturing division leapt to Pounds 110.2m (Pounds 21.8m).
Barclay was a lower margin business, with a 2-3 per cent return on sales
rather than the 7-10 per cent of retailing. It also accounted for much of
the Pounds 14.2m increase in working capital.
The Supersave drugstore division added 15 shops to make a total of 247 and
sales rose to Pounds 38.9m (Pounds 31.6m). Like-for-like growth has improved
to 8 per cent since the year-end. Holland & Barrett healthfood added 26
shops to make 250. Like-for-like growth was slight. Overall sales reached
Pounds 26.8m (Pounds 21.9m).
Net debt rose from Pounds 20.9m at the year-end to Pounds 32.4m, giving
gearing of 31 per cent. Mr Lloyd said interest payments were nine times
covered by operating profits of Pounds 25.4m (Pounds 16.5m).
The interim dividend is raised to 2p (1.55p).
COMMENT
Lloyds has gone out of its way to reassure the sceptics with copious notes
on cashflow and Cadbury-style reforms of its board - not that anyone could
doubt that Allen Lloyd is still the boss. It now wants to be seen as a
wholesome healthcare distributor, like AAH and UniChem, rather than as an
acquisition-led retailer throwing its paper around. Hence the stress on the
galloping organic growth at Barclay. However, third place in the wholesale
market has proved something of a graveyard - Macarthy and Medicopharma
pulled out in recent years. Lloyds may do better through its bias towards
toiletries and OTC treatments. On the retail front, its ambition is hardly
dormant with more than 100 store openings a year. Full-year profit is
forecast to top Pounds 50m (Pounds 36.9m) giving a prospective p/e of 11.
Some discount to the market is to be expected because of its hyper-active
record, but a 30 per cent one looks too much. The price has recovered
substantially since September, but there looks to be room for a little more.
