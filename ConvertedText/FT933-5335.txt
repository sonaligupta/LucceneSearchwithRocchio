FT  03 SEP 93 / International Company News: Avon warns of shortfall


   By FRANK MCGURTY


AVON PRODUCTS, the US cosmetics, toiletries and jewellery group, yesterday
warned that third-quarter earnings would fall short of its results for the
same period of 1992. Last time it posted net income of Dollars 53.9m, or 75
cents a share, on revenues of Dollars 938.8m.
With analysts anticipating earnings per share of about 85 cents in the
current quarter, the news prompted a sharp reaction on Wall Street. Avon's
shares closed Dollars 4 1/2 down at Dollars 55 in heavy trading.
Avon blamed the third-quarter performance on the continued sluggishness of
the US economy, combined with the cost of implementing 'changes designed to
reorient and redirect the US business'.
But the company is optimistic that sales and earnings will improve and
expects fourth-quarter and full-year results to show increases over
comparable 1992 periods.
Best known for its worldwide force of door-to-door sales representatives,
Avon has nearly quadrupled advertising spending this year, mainly to support
Avon Select, a direct marketing scheme allowing customers to order products
by telephone, fax or mail.
