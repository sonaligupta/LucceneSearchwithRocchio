FT  09 JUN 92 / People: Putting something back


Gordon Milne, who resigned as managing director of Scottish Metropolitan,
the Glasgow-based property company, in January, is to become visiting
professor of land economy at Aberdeen University. The part- time post will
involve Milne, who is 55, teaching and researching on property and land use
 -thereby also helping the university bridge the notorious gap between
academe and the business world.
In this latter role Milne will tell companies what the university's
department of land economy can offer them, with the aim of developing
consultancy services and obtaining sponsorship for research - all part of
the way in which universities try to diversify their sources of income.
He will target companies which either have big property interests or operate
in the land economy department's special field of marine resources
management, which covers such things as fishing and fish farming.
Milne is not a graduate himself. But he knows Aberdeen University well,
having delivered an annual Scottish Metropolitan property lecture since
1974. Having been forced to resign from the company he was long identified
with, by institutional investors annoyed when recession forced it into loss,
he say he regards the new post as a 'mid-career switch by means of which I
can put something back.'
