FT  25 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Specialeyes Pounds 2.3m in red and raising
Pounds 1.4m


   By PETER PEARSE


SPECIALEYES, the USM-quoted optical retailer which saw substantial board
changes last year, yesterday finally produced its results for the 78 week
period to November 28 1992. Pre-tax losses totalled Pounds 2.27m.
At the same time it announced it was raising Pounds 1.41m net through the
issue of Pounds 1.55m nominal of 10 per cent convertible unsecured loan
stock 2000 at par. The sum raised will be used to eliminate bank borrowings
and supply funds for capital expenditure.
Mr Jim Power, chairman, said that the pre-placing of the rescue package was
essential before Morison Stoneham, the auditor, would sign off the accounts
on a going concern basis. He said he regretted the 'very late' publication
of the figures.
However he added that in many respects the hardest work was yet to come,
pointing to the 'weak financial controls and trading disciplines' that were
a main factor behind Specialeyes' problems.
Having identified the flaws, they now had to be addressed, he said, adding,
'retail is all about detail.' The capital expenditure programme would
initially be aimed at refurbishment of the stores and the introduction of
electronic point of sale equipment.
The pre-tax losses were struck after exceptional charges of Pounds 904,000
to cover the costs of closing six branches, and reducing central overheads
and head count. Mr Power said that Pounds 1m had been stripped out of the
payroll, mainly through the departure of 15 middle managers, and four
directors at Christmas.
Turnover in the 78 weeks was Pounds 25.9m and interest payable Pounds
232,000. Losses per share emerged at 14.16p. In the 53 weeks to June 1 1991,
pre-tax profits had been Pounds 240,000, turnover Pounds 14.8m, interest
payable Pounds 102,000, and earnings per share 2.3p.
