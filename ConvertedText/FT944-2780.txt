FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Trafalgar House cuts charges - Lower
provision of Pounds 24m for further rationalisation


   By DAVID WIGHTON


Trafalgar House, the engineering and property conglomerate, has returned to
profit after three years of losses, helped by a sharp fall in provisions and
the cost cutting carried out since Hongkong Land took effective control last
year.
About 2,000 jobs have been cut from the engineering division in the past
year, reducing costs by about Pounds 30m.
Yesterday the group announced a further Pounds 24m of provisions for
additional rationalisation and redundancies. These will fall mainly in the
engineering division in the UK and Europe.
Engineering profits fell to Pounds 43.7m (Pounds 77.2m) on turnover of
Pounds 2.23bn (Pounds 2.25bn) in the year to September 30. Group operating
profits before exceptionals rose to Pounds 93.6m (Pounds 91.1m).
Mr Nigel Rich, chief executive, said engineering margins had continued to
fall as the division worked through contracts won during the recession. He
warned engineering profits could fall further this year before margins
recovered. The order book had remained fairly constant at about Pounds 2bn.
'There has been a pick up in the steel industry and petrochemicals and we
are getting a lot more work coming out of Asia.'
After total exceptional debits of Pounds 24.1m, Trafalgar recorded a pre-tax
profit of Pounds 45.6m. A debit of Pounds 396.7m in the previous year
resulted in a loss of Pounds 347m.
Mr Gavin Launder, conglomerates analyst at Goldman Sachs, described the
results as 'quite encouraging' but left his current year forecast unchanged
at Pounds 99m. He reduced his earnings per share forecast from 4.5p to 4p.
A sharply reduced interest bill of Pounds 23.9m (Pounds 41.4m) followed the
Pounds 400m convertible share issue a year ago, which left Trafalgar with
gearing of just 3 per cent at its year end on shareholders' funds of Pounds
708.6m.
Operating profits from construction were little changed at Pounds 13.1m
(Pounds 12.5m) and there was a strong recovery in housebuilding, where
profits jumped to Pounds 19m (Pounds 6.1m).
Analysts were encouraged by the Pounds 500,000 underlying profit from
commercial property - compared with a Pounds 15.4m loss - but the company
said the flat contribution of Pounds 7.8m from shipping was disappointing.
The mass of exceptional items included property write-backs of Pounds 5.8m -
after write-downs of Pounds 178m the previous year - and a Pounds 15m
provision for environmental risks related to a site in the US.
Earnings per share were 1.1p (47.6p loss) and Trafalgar is paying a final
dividend of 1p, after passing the interim, as predicted a year ago.
