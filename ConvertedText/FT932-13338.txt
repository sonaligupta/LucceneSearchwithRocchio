   By NIKKI TAIT


SARA LEE, the Chicago-based consumer products company, yesterday reported a
10.8 per cent increase in after-tax profits, to Dollars 152m, in the third
quarter to March 27. The improvement came on sales 5.2 per cent higher, at
Dollars 3.3bn.
The company said it saw 'continued margin improvement in packaged foods'.
However, on the personal products side, strong performance in the US was
offset by weakness in Europe, and operating profits from this division
slipped 2.9 per cent, to Dollars 127m.
The group is showing net profit of Dollars 514m for the first nine months on
sales of Dollars 10.7bn. Earnings per share for the quarter were 30 cents,
against 27 cents a year ago. The nine-month figure is Dollars 1.
