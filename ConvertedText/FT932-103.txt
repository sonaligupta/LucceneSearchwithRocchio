FT  30 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Ferranti seeks cash injection


   By PAUL TAYLOR


FERRANTI International, which came close to collapse following the 1989
discovery of huge fraud in International Signal and Control, its US
subsidiary, is seeking a strategic partner to take a minority equity stake
and help strengthen its shrunken balance sheet.
Mr Eugene Anderson, chairman of the electronics and defence company since
1990, said it was looking for 'a substantial cash injection,' which would
help ease tight liquidity problems and enable it to wipe out Pounds 19m of
overdue creditors payments.
Ferranti has cut its bank borrowings from Pounds 700m to under Pounds 100m
since 1989 and reduced its overdue creditors payments from Pounds 55m, but
Mr Anderson said the process needed to be accelerated. 'I should like to
operate with a little less adversity,' he said.
He said the group has already held talks with a number of unidentified
potential partners but had not yet reached an agreement. Asked if Ferranti
had been warned away from a rights issue, Mr Anderson answered that the
group's financial advisers 'believe the strategy we are following is the
right one.'
Yesterday the group reported a reduced, but slightly larger than expected
Pounds 24.5m pre-tax loss in the year to March 31 compared to a restated
Pounds 46.2m loss the previous year. The latest accounts have been produced
on the basis of the new FRS 3 accounting standard.
Losses per share were 2.43p (4.71p). The share price fell 3p to 11 3/4 p
after the announcement.
Turnover fell to Pounds 230.9m (Pounds 362.6m) including Pounds 216.9m
(Pounds 243.9m) from continuing operations and the group posted an operating
loss of Pounds 5.6m (Pounds 9.7m) including a Pounds 3m (Pounds 3.3m) loss
attributable to continuing operations.
The group also incurred non-operating costs of Pounds 7m (Pounds 23.8m), but
interest costs declined to Pounds 12.2m (Pounds 13.5m).
