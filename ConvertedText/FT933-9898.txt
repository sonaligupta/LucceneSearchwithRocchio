FT  06 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Demand for gold increases 1%


   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent


GOLD DEMAND rose by 1 per cent in the second quarter of this year compared
with the same period in 1992 in spite of an 11 per cent rise in the US
dollar price from its 1993 low point, according to estimates by the World
Gold Council.
The council is a promotional organisation funded by gold producers. Markets
monitored for its quarterly demand trends survey account for about 75 per
cent of world demand for gold in the form of bars, coins and jewellery.
There was an 18 per cent drop in demand between the first quarter of this
year - the gold price fell to a seven-year low in the first quarter - and
the second quarter, from 700.1 tonnes to 575.3 tonnes.
Mr Bryan Parker, strategic planning manager for the council, suggested that,
as gold demand was seasonal, the better comparison was with last year's
second quarter.
The council says that while the dollar gold price rose during the second
quarter there were signs of a slowing of demand growth in the
price-sensitive Middle East and India markets.
Imports to key areas such as Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and Dubai, used as
staging points for gold smuggled into countries where imports are banned,
were also significantly below those in the second quarter of 1992.
Higher prices encouraged gold producers to stop selling forward so much
metal and to unwind hedging positions. The council estimated that this
resulted in about 500,000 troy ounces (15.5 tonnes) of gold being withdrawn
from the market.
In the developed markets, purchases of gold by jewellery makers fell by 5
per cent or 7.6 tonnes compared with the second quarter of 1992, to 147
tonnes. Increased demand in the US and France was more than offset by a fall
in Japan, the UK, Germany, Italy, Spain and Greece.
There was a 32 per cent rise in sales of gold bullion coins, however, to
12.8 tonnes, mainly in North America and Europe, which the council suggested
was an indication of a revival of interest in gold among western investors.
Gold demand in the first half of this year was 12 per cent up at 1,275.4
tonnes compared with the same months of 1992, the council said. There was a
24 per cent rise in the first quarter.
