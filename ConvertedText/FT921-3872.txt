FT  12 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Scholes blames recession for fall to less
than Pounds 1m


   By ANGUS FOSTER


SCHOLES, the electrical products group, blamed continuing recession for a
sharp fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.25m to Pounds 916,000 in the six
months to the end of December.
But the interim dividend of 1.6p is maintained, from earnings of 1.7p
(3.9p). The company said there were early indications that the decline in
orders had halted and some business areas were witnessing small
improvements.
Scholes also announced that Mr Reg Harrington, chairman and chief executive,
had been taken seriously ill. His executive responsibilities have been
transferred to Mr Bill Riches, group finance director. Mr Richard Morgan, a
non-executive director, becomes non-executive chairman.
Turnover slipped to Pounds 29.5m (Pounds 33.9m). The company said the
decline in operating profit to Pounds 1.25m (Pounds 3.45m) was wholly due to
reduced sales volumes.
Interest charges declined to Pounds 541,000 (Pounds 958,000) after the
company reduced borrowings by Pounds 2.3m through improved cash and stock
management.
Scholes said its joint ventures with Asea Brown Boveri were making progress.
