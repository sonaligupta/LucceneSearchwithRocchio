FT  21 APR 94 / IMF World Economic Outlook: Rise in long-term rates rings
the alarm bells


   By PETER NORMAN


The recent rise in long-term interest rates is ringing alarm bells among the
Group of Seven leading industrial countries and at the International
Monetary Fund.
European monetary officials said yesterday that the rise in long-term rates
since February had been put on the agenda of Sunday's meeting in Washington
of G7 finance ministers and central bank governors, while the IMF reported
that the increase was 'of concern'.
Mr Michael Mussa, the director of the IMF's research department, told a
press conference at the Fund's headquarters yesterday that there was a
'degree of (financial market) overreaction' in so far as US long bond rates
had exceeded 7 per cent.
In the wake of this week's increase of the Federal funds rate to 3.75 per
cent, the yield of the benchmark US long bond rose on Monday to 7.41 per
cent.
However, Mr Mussa also said that much of the rise in long bond rates from
just over 6 per cent was a 'normal and not undesirable reaction to the
strengthening of growth prospects in the US'. There had been a dramatic
upwards revision in expectations of US growth since the autumn.
But there was no reason for long-term rates to be above 7 per cent if the
Federal Reserve could keep inflation in the 3 per cent to 4 per cent range,
Mr Mussa said. The IMF believes that if monetary conditions in the US are
allowed to tighten sufficiently, fears of inflation should ease, reducing
pressure on long-term rates.
Mr Mussa said that by raising short-term rates, the US was not putting on
the brake: it was merely easing the accelerator.
