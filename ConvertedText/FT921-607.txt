FT  28 MAR 92 / Names' decision


MEMBERS of the Outhwaite syndicate on the Lloyd's insurance market who did
not benefit from the Pounds 116m out-of-court settlement agreed between 987
Names and 81 agents last month are poised to take early legal action to
recover insurance losses.
The 1992 Outhwaite Names Association represents 378 of the 627 Names who
were not party to the successful action. Solicitors have advised that their
claim may be 'time-barred' if a writ is not issued by April 29.
