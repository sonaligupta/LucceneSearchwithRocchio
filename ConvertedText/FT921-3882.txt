FT  12 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Trilion losses rise in uncertain climate


Difficult trading, largely resulting from the uncertainties of the Channel 3
licence applications, was blamed by Trilion for pre-tax losses increasing to
Pounds 3.61m in the year to September 30, against Pounds 376,000.
The USM-quoted provider of television facilities and producer of television
programmes said that it had been a year of change. Following board changes
and a review of operations Stylus Television and some operating units were
closed, provisions for which have been included in the accounts.
Turnover fell from Pounds 15.8m to Pounds 14.2m and the pre-tax figure was
struck after an exceptional charge of Pounds 708,000 relating to closure
costs. There was also a turndown from interest received of Pounds 144,000 to
a charge of Pounds 283,000.
Losses per share were 6.2p (0.8p) and the dividend is being passed. There
was a final payment of 0.5p last time.
An extraordinary charge of Pounds 688,000 covered the costs associated with
the application for the Channel 3 licence for Wales and the west of England
and further provisions for discontinued premises costs.
Trilion will have a 10 per cent stake in Westcountry Television which won
the licence for the south west of England.
