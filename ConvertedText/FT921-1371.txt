FT  24 MAR 92 / International Company News: Bid for Central Guaranty
branches

NATIONAL Bank of Canada and CT Financial Services, the trust company arm of
Imasco, the financial services, fast-food, tobacco and retailing group, are
bidding for about 100 branches of Central Guaranty Trust, a key member of
the troubled Central Capital group.
The branches have about CDollars 7bn (USDollars 5.8bn) of assets and
represent about half Central Guaranty's business.
The two bidders would pay a premium approaching CDollars 200m, analysts
estimate, to be used to shore up Central Guaranty's capital position.
National would take 48 branches in Atlantic Canada and Quebec while CT
Financial, parent of Canada Trust, would gain 49 branches in eastern and
northern Ontario. Central Guaranty would be left with its business centred
on southern Ontario, with branches in western Canada.
National Bank said it had revised the offer it originally made last December
and is making it jointly with Canada Trust. It is Canada's sixth largest
chartered bank, while Canada Trust is one of the country's two biggest trust
companies.
Earlier, Montreal Trustco, a subsidiary of BCE, planned to take over all
Central Guaranty through a merger, but failed to reach agreement on terms.
National and Canada Trust say their joint offer has received approval from
Central Guaranty's board.
