FT  13 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Yield attractions


   By MICHAEL DYSON


FEW INVESTORS would be excited when offered a real yield of 3.09 per cent,
writes Michael Dyson.
But what if they were told they could buy Treasury Index-Linked 4.375 per
cent 2004 at Pounds 114.625 and, in addition to an index-linked income which
started at around 4 per cent, could expect to be repaid in 2004 at a price
of Pounds 114.625, or Pounds 157.45, or Pounds 233.285? Those are the
tax-free repayment prices, assuming inflation of 0.88 per cent, 4 per cent
and 8 per cent respectively. While the repayment of Pounds 233.285 may sound
the most attractive, inflation would mean that in real terms the return is
slightly worse.
Another approach for investors is to consider what inflation rate will be
needed to make an index-linked investment better than, say, a building
society account. This is known as the break even inflation rate. For
example, looking at the 2 per cent Index Linked 1996; to the 40 per cent
taxpayer, if inflation averages 2 per cent over the next two years, the
total net return of 4 per cent would match the best net building society
returns.
In practice, most accounts pay lower rates and even a low inflation rate,
probably below 1 per cent, would be better than deposit rates. Any 'extra'
inflation will be a bonus and, as inflation is likely to be at least 3.5 per
cent over the next two years, the Treasury 2 per cent index-linked 1996 is
significantly more attractive than a savings account.
Reports suggest the corporate index-linked market may be set for further
expansion. Of the few existing issues, Severn River Crossing 6 per cent IL
2012 continues to offer a superior inflation-proof return.
Zero dividend preference shares are as far removed as you can get from
index-linked bonds. They are investment trust shares that pay no dividend
but instead promise to repay the holders of the shares at a higher price.
For instance, Sphere IT zeros could be bought on November 11 for 91.75p for
repayment at 107.5p on October 31, 1995. The capital gain of 17.2 per cent
equates to a semi-annual gross redemption yield of 8.35 per cent.
While we would not suggest that the repayment of zeros is totally without
risk, Sphere's assets are currently 30 per cent more than is required to
repay the zeros in full and we do believe that the surplus assets provide an
effective cushion against falling markets.
