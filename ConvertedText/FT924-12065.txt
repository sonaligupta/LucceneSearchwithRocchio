increase

KAO, the Japanese toiletries maker, yesterday reported a 6.9 per cent rise
in taxable parent profits to Y21.2bn (Dollars 173m) for the first half to
September, from Y19.91bn a year earlier, due to firm demand for its new
shampoos, cosmetics and detergents. This exceeds the group's April forecast
of Y20bn.
The progress was made despite Japan's fall in personal consumption, with
sales rising 5.8 per cent to Y305.2bn, compared with a previous Y288.54bn
and an April forecast of Y300bn.
Kao said sales by its personal care and cosmetics division rose 9.3 per cent
to Y109.6bn, thanks to new facial cleansers and powders and a new coloured
hair rinse.
Laundry detergent and soap sales rose 3 per cent to Y120.7bn on solid demand
for fabric softeners and bleaches. Sales of hygiene items, such as
disposable nappies, grew 12.4 per cent to Y35.7bn. In contrast, chemical
sales fell 0.3 per cent to Y39.2bn, due to a slump in industrial demand.
For the full year to March, Kao expects taxable parent profits to rise 3.3
per cent to Y43bn.
