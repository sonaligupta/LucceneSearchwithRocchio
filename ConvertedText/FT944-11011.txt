FT  08 NOV 94 / International Company News: Siemens in multimedia alliance


   By ALAN CANE


Siemens, the German electrical and electronics manufacturer, has formed an
alliance with Scientific Atlanta and Sun Microsystems, both of the US, to
develop and market systems for the emerging multimedia market.
The plan is to develop a design, or architecture, for multimedia networks
which will be accepted as the industry standard.
The alliance intends to market the system to cable operators and telephone
companies, initially in the US.
Multimedia has become an important focus for electronics groups over the
past year. It implies the delivery of information to the home or office in
digital form over fibre-optic cable or telephone lines and in interactive
fashion.
Customers will be able to send messages and commands to the system making
possible, for example, home shopping, home banking and video-on-demand.
The Siemens alliance is one of a number of groups developing multimedia
architectures in the hope of establishing its version as the industry
standard.
Among those involved in separate multimedia trials are American Telephone &
Telegraph, British Telecommunications and Microsoft, the world's largest
computer software house.
Siemens is an expert in telecommunications switching and has developed the
basic multimedia software, IMMXpress.
Scientific Atlanta has experience of cable television systems while Sun
Microsystems, a workstation manufacturer, is an expert in open, or industry
standard, operating software and is heavily involved in the worldwide
Internet computer network.
Scientific Atlanta has developed the 'set-top boxes' - controllers which
receive and translate the digital signals - for a multimedia trial planned
by Time Warner to take place in Orlando, Florida, this year.
