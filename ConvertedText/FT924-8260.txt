TURNER Broadcasting System, the media and entertainment group that controls
the CNN cable network, yesterday posted third-quarter net income of Dollars
12.5m, or 5 cents a share, up from Dollars 7.4m, or 1 cent, a year ago.
Gains from the company's entertainment operations offset weaker performances
from its sports, news and real estate businesses.
Stripping out extraordinary items in both years, earnings stood at 2 cents a
share, against a loss of 1 cent a share last year. Operating profits were 8
per cent higher at Dollars 64m, while revenues rose 16 per cent to Dollars
456.4m from Dollars 392.6m
Revenues from the entertainment division rose 11 per cent to Dollars 23m,
including Dollars 10m from several start-up operations in 1991 and the
acquisition of the Hanna-Barbera animation studio. Increased advertising
revenue also contributed to the improvement. Operating profits from
entertainment rose 18 per cent to Dollars 43.6m.
Operating earnings from Turner's news division, which includes CNN, fell 3
per cent to Dollars 36.4m, from Dollars 37.6m, although revenues rose 15 per
cent to Dollars 126.9m from Dollars 110.1m. The company blamed the costs of
covering the US election, and increased costs associated with international
operations.
Operating profits from the sports division, which includes an equity stake
in the Atlanta Braves football team, tumbled to Dollars 493,000 from Dollars
2m.
For the nine months, the group lifted net income to Dollars 47.9m from
Dollars 42.5m, which took earnings per share to 19 cents, against 6 cents.
Revenues were Dollars 1.23bn, compared with Dollars 1.08bn.
