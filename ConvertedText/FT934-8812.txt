FT  13 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Not all are united on EU


   From F P JENKIN


Sir, Since - notwithstanding the meretricious logodaedaly of the drafters of
the Maastricht treaty - the erstwhile European Community has palpably not
become a Union, may I suggest that you slightly modify your proposed
Financial Times terminology to 'European Union (sic)'.
