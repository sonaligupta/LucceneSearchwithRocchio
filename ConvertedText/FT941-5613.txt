FT  05 MAR 94 / Financial markets will not affect interest rates says
Chancellor


   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT


Prospects for further cuts in UK interest rates are unlikely to be affected
by the turbulence of international financial markets, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor of the exchequer, indicated yesterday, Paul Cheeseright writes.
At the end of a week when markets have been buffeted by a surge of
inflationary fears in the US and surprising money supply figures in Germany,
Mr Clarke stressed the independence of UK rate policy.
'When I make decisions about interest rates I don't look first of all at the
international scene. I consider what is the medium-term outlook for the
British economy, have a look at what's happened to our money supply, what's
happened to our exchange rate and what's happening to asset prices and the
economy generally here,' he said.
