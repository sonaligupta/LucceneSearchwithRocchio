FT  07 MAR 94 / EU plan for works meetings attacked


European Commission propos-als to force companies to consult with employees
on a range of business issues is an 'unwarranted interference' on their
right to manage and should be resisted, says the British Chambers of
Commerce.
The business lobbying group said the need for legislation across the
European Union on this subject was 'questionable'. It added that employers
should be free to establish their own internal procedures based on what was
most appropriate.
