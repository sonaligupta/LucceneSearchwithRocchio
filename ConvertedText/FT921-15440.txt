FT  10 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Interest swing boosts Abbey


Abbey, the Irish-based housebuilder and engineer, incurred an interim
trading loss but improved pre-tax profit from IPounds 67,000 to IPounds
367,000 (Pounds 344,000).
In the six months to October 31 turnover fell from IPounds 28.2m to IPounds
20.1m, throwing the group into a trading loss of IPounds 81,000, against a
profit of IPounds 1.6m. However, that was more than offset by a swing from
interest charged of IPounds 1.63m to received of IPounds 448,000.
Earnings were 0.63p (0.1p). No dividend has been paid for the past two
years.
