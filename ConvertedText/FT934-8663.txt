FT  13 NOV 93 / GCHQ faces shift pay fury


   By RICHARD DONKIN


SHIFT WORKERS at GCHQ, the government eavesdropping centre based at
Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, are to have pay cuts and revised staffing rotas
imposed on them in a new employment package, Richard Donkin writes.
The new rotas are to be introduced at the start of next month in spite of a
90 per cent vote to reject them by shift workers of the staff federation
that was created when unions were banned in 1984.
Mr Clive Lloyd, one of the former GCHQ staff who was sacked when he refused
to resign from his union said: 'In the words of a friend who still works at
the centre, they are in uproar and furious.' The unrest is likely to
embarrass the government, which has agreed to talks about the possible
restoration of union membership at the centre.
GCHQ last night accepted that the new system was unpopular. It said the
arrangements were being phased in. There had been a 'change in needs' for
the existing shift working arrangements.
