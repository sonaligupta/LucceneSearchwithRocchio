FT  08 JUN 92 / Construction Contracts: Housing the Prison Service


FAIRCLOUGH BUILDING, the AMEC Group specialist, has been awarded a Pounds
57m contract by developer Hyperion Properties, a subsidiary of NFC, for
construction of a 450,000 sq ft headquarters building at Derby for Her
Majesty's Prison Service.
Forming part of the Government's Common User Estate, the four-storey
headquarters building will be situated at St Mary's Wharf, to the north of
Derby town centre, and will provide modern air conditioned offices for up to
2,000 people, 60 per cent of whom are expected to relocate from London.
The steel-framed headquarters building with curtain wall cladding and full
air conditioning has the support of the Royal Fine Art Commission and will
provide maximum flexibility of office space interlinked with specialist
facilities including conference rooms, dining area, fitness suite and
creche.
The curtain walling on the structure, which will be Derby's largest office
building, is believed to be one of the largest aluminium curtain walling
contracts ever let in Europe.
