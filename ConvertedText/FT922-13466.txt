FT  11 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Properties hit by talk of big sale


   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and COLIN MILLHAM


PROPERTY stocks were depressed again yesterday, despite the huge surge in
the rest of the equity market, as further news emerged underlining the
fundamental problems besetting the sector.
A report in the trade press suggested that Norwich Union was about to sell
Pounds 300m of City office buildings in an attempt to reduce its exposure to
the ailing commercial property market. Traders said the story pointed to the
continuing weakness in office rentals, which are falling by 30 per cent a
year, according to a report from surveyors Richard Ellis published
yesterday.
Mr Carl Gough at UBS Phillips & Drew said the re-election of a Conservative
government had not changed the house view on the sector. 'We were negative
before and we are negative now. Even with the prospect of lower interest
rates, the amount of property overhanging the investment and letting market
will make sure the sector continues to underperform relative to the rest of
the market.' UBS forecasts that this will be by 9.5 per cent over the next
two years.
Of the leading stocks, MEPC lost 2 to 286p and Hammerson ordinary plunged 24
to 360p. Making small gains were: Great Portland Estates, up 4 to 139p, Land
Securities ahead 10 at 386p, and British Land 5 better at 172p.
Utilities shine
Utilities had obvious attraction after the election, because the stocks were
so politically vulnerable. Mr Donald Waterman, analyst at Panmure Gordon,
said many investors were underweight in the sector during the run up to
Thursday's poll. He added that fears of renationalisation under Labour had
probably been overdone, but it was 'the uncertainty of what Labour might do,
rather than the reality of what they would do' that had hit shares during
the election campaign.
Electricity and water shares showed gains of up to, and in some cases above,
20 per cent. The Scottish generators failed to fully sustain early gains
which took them above their partly paid offered price of 100p, but finished
up around 13 per cent, with Scottish Power rising 12 1/2 to 95 1/2 p and
Scot Hydro 13 to 98p.
Hanson active
Conglomerate Hanson was the most heavily traded stock on the London market.
It closed 10 up at 227p with a massive recorded turnover of more than 55m
shares. Dealers said Hanson, with significant international exposure, was
well placed to benefit from hopes of a US recovery and any improvement in UK
economic fortunes. Also, securities house UBS Phillips & Drew became a buyer
of the stock because of the 'elimination of political worries'.
Attitudes towards the stock were further enhanced by the sharp rise in ICI,
as Lord Hanson is believed to still have a 2.8 per cent stake in the
chemicals and pharmaceuticals group. ICI, which has been well regarded in
the light of recent rationalisation and which tends to be an indicator of
market trends, jumped 35 to 1308p and that rise would have added around
Pounds 7m to the value of the Hanson stake.
Oils languish
The oil majors failed to participate in the market euphoria as concern about
their financial prospects continued to cast a pall. BP has been hit by a
number of profit forecast cuts in recent days as well as concerns about the
potential of Columbia's Cusiana oil field, in which it has a large stake. It
has one friend in securities house Hoare Govett, the company's broker, which
this week turned buyer of the stock but most houses are sellers and there is
a feeling that recent buying in the US is also drying up. The shares rose
only 2 to 250p.
Shell announced that its Australian subsidiary faced legal action from coal
miner Austen and Butta to stall a bid. It lifted just 4 to 465p.
Most of the oil companies were relatively weak. Lasmo was down at one stage
before rallying to close a penny up at 192p. Enterprise gained 3 to 396p.
US investors were said to be enthusiastic buyers of Glaxo following recent
underperformance. The shares lifted 19 to 782p.
The best-traded utility stock was the British Telecom partly-paid, with
nearly 53m shares being recorded. The shares, which made a high of 126p,
closed at 119 1/2 p, up 19 on the day. The rise meant the shares passed
their offer price of 110p.
BT ordinary gained 21 to 335p, after hitting 341p at one stage. Turnover was
28m.
The removal of the threat of extra regulation in the telecoms sector also
helped Vodafone Group, the shares climbing 35 to 349p in big volume of 13m.
Laura Ashley was a weak feature among a buoyant stores sector, falling 3 to
88p. Dixons put on 26 to 236p, following Thursday's recommendation from
County NatWest, while Kingfisher, another on the County buy list, rose 43 to
530p.
Pearson, which has a 16 per cent stake in BSkyB, had been held back by vague
concerns that it might be affected by a proposed Labour party review on
media ownership. With those fears out of the way and with renewed hopes for
an upturn in advertising revenues the shares bounced 63 to 843p. Granada
Group, another BSkyB shareholder, jumped 22 to 257p.
Publisher United Newspaper's rise of 29 to 388p was assisted by positive
research from SG Warburg Securities.
Building stocks soared on the hope of an interest rate cut.
Construction groups also prospered, particularly south-east England house
builders, such as Berkeley Group up 56 at 276p.
The fact that Labour's minimum wage would not now be enacted sent Forte 39
higher to 243p in very big turnover of 9.4m. Courtaulds Textiles, also
previously overshadowed by the Labour policy, leapt 53 to 490p. Rank
Organisation jumped 47 to 735p. US interest rate cuts helped Thorn EMI to
add 37 to 804p.
The ending of election uncertainty was likely to unleash a rush of holiday
bookings, said some analysts. Airtours jumped 33 to 274p and Owners Abroad
added 7 1/2 to 97 1/2 p.
Smith Industries added 25 to 305p ahead of next week's interim figures.
British Aerospace moved 20 ahead to 338p as it announced it was looking for
a buyer for a majority stake in its corporate jet division.
VSEL, where fears recently surfaced that a fourth Trident submarine would
not be ordered in the event of a Labour party win, greeted the Conservative
party victory by initially recording a 60p jump. The shares eventually ended
at a more modest 40 up at 370p.
Siebe reversed its recent dull performance since it entered the FT-SE 100 by
jumping 33 to 632p.
The poor outlook for steel in both the UK and Europe caused the shares of
British Steel to register a modest gain of only a penny to 70p. Some 12m
shares were traded.
Eurotunnel was one of two FT-SE 100 stocks to buck the market trend easing a
penny to 402p as worries about the company's finances remained.
