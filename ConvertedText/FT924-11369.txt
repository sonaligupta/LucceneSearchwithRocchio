FT  27 OCT 92 / International Company News: Dean Witter and NationsBank to
join forces


   By PATRICK HARVERSON


   NEW YORK


DEAN Witter Financial Services, the securities brokerage arm of retailing
group Sears, Roebuck, and NationsBank, the fourth-largest commercial bank in
the US, have announced plans to form a jointly-owned brokerage firm that
will sell mutual funds and other investment products to bank customers.
The new company, Nations Securities, will begin operations early next year
with 400 investment professionals located in NationsBank's branches in nine
US states. The company also plans to market products and services to other
US commercial banks.
Although still subject to regulatory approval, the agreement is the latest
example of how the once-strict divide between the commercial banking and
securities businesses, enshrined in the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, is being
gradually dismantled.
Several big banks, including JP Morgan and Bankers Trust, are already major
players in the securities underwriting business, and only last week the
Federal Reserve gave Republic Bank of New York approval to open a securities
brokerage.
The joint venture is also an attempt by companies from two increasingly
inter-connected industries to exploit their respective strengths. Dean
Witter will provide the brokerage expertise and distribution channels of a
big Wall Street firm, while NationsBank will provide wide customer reach
through its branches, as well as the financial muscle of a major bank.
Other banks are likely to follow in NationsBank's footsteps. By offering
customers in-house access to a wide range of higher-yielding investments,
NationsBank and other banks will hope to stem the outflow of deposits caused
by the sharp fall in the returns earned by bank savings products.
