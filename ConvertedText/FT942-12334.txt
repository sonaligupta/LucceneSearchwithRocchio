FT  29 APR 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (14): Pinchpenny
picks perks with profit - Equities / Shareholder discounts / Choosing shares
for shareholder discounts is deeply amateurish. Or is it? Gillian O'Connor
checked the price movements of 29 companies


   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR


Peter Pinchpenny opened his eyes with steely determination. A hard day of
company perking lay ahead of him, but he was equal to the challenge.
Most investors buy shares because they expect their prices to rise. Not
Peter: he bought them to get as many shareholder discounts as he could. And
his life was dedicated to making the most of his share perks.
Chewing stoically through his normal breakfast of crisps (free at the
Benson's AGM), and Stilton from a Park Foods hamper (20 per cent off), Peter
allowed his mind to flicker briefly back to the previous night. London
International Group's AGM handout of samples ('Something for the weekend,
Sir?') was nearly exhausted.
Enough of such wimpish nostalgia. Another day, another discount. And it was
good weather for a journey. Should he Concorde to New York (10 per cent off
to BA shareholders, but only available once a year)? The weather was still a
bit choppy for a sea voyage to the Isle of Man (50 per cent discount IoM
Steam Packet Co), Scandinavia (25 per cent off from Scandinavian Seaways) or
even Calais (50 per cent from P&O). Anyway, he had already decided that his
next foreign trip would be 'The Big One', underneath the Channel whenever
Eurotunnel finally pressed the button. As one of the original '87ers with
1,500 units, he could enjoy unlimited concessionary shuttle trips.
Surely in April he was allowed to indulge himself with a few home thoughts?
It was a little early for the Bluebell Railway (as a 'Benefactor' he got
free lifetime travel). So he appeared to be faced with a choice between the
Romney, Hythe & Dymchurch or Severn Valley railways (more free travel) or
Camelot Chauffeur Hire (10 per cent off, thanks to his Savoy Hotel
shareholding).
To be honest, he found steam travel rather grubby. Yes, of course he could
be sure of a 25 per cent cleaning bill discount at Brooks, Johnson Group or
Sketchley. But today he was not wearing his Gieves Group suit (10 per cent
discount). Friday was Moss Bros day (10 per cent off hire charges). So
Camelot Chauffeurs it was.
There was the normal embarrassing choice of hotels for the night.
Twenty-three different companies offerred shareholder discounts. (Surely
they weren't sufferring from lack of bums in beds during the recession?) He
felt like being cossetted. The Lodore Swiss on Derwentwater had gone off a
bit under Stakis, but Broadway's Lygon Arms (Savoy) was as phonily authentic
as ever.
What's more a slight detour on the way to the Cotswolds would allow him to
pop into the Middle Aston showroom of Fired Earth Tiles and pick some
hand-painted kitchen tiles (12 1/2 per cent off). But then he began to worry
whether they would meld in with the rest of his furnishings.
The kitchen units were Nixons (10 per cent off to Bellway shareholders) and
the furniture a mixture of Courts (10 per cent) and World of Leather (10 per
cent). Crappy decanters from Signet, the former Ratners, (10 per cent off)
mingled with the real thing from Aspreys (15 per cent off to investors with
over Pounds 16,000 worth of shares).
But his real treasure was the 18th century chaise longue from New Bond
Street antique dealers Mallett. Malletts did not operate anything as vulgar
as a shareholder discount, but 'discussed possible reductions' with
shareholders at the time of sale. Quite how these discussions differed from
those they held with customers who were not shareholders was not quite clear
to Peter. But he was much fonder of his Malletts chaise longue than of his
Ratners decanter. Even his new glasses (10 per cent off at Specialeyes)
could not make the decanter look anything other than crappy.
Somehow the day was drifting away. And he hadn't actually done any perking
yet. Lethargy assaulted him. Wouldn't it be comfortable just to put his feet
up (20 per cent off his Stylo shoes), and browse gently? He had discount
subscriptions to any number of EMAP and Reed magazines, and his shelves were
stuffed with 90 per cent bargains from Dillons (Pentos).
Could anything be done to assuage the sadness of the human condition? Even
at 25 per cent off, Regina Royal Jelly never seemed to do much for him. He
had a choice of 10 different crates of discount booze, but his unhappiness
was beyond the reach of mere alcohol.
Suddenly a longing for a fine and private place surged over him. The words
'Chosen Heritage' floated in front of his eyes. And for the first time that
day Peter Pinchpenny actually smiled. Thanks to Great Southern, he could not
only pre-pay his funeral, but also get a discount on it.
Choosing shares because they offer attractive shareholder discounts is
deeply amateurish. So it's rather irritating that Peter Pinchpenny's
portfolio has actually done well recently. When we checked out the 29 quoted
companies mentioned, we discovered that over the past year, their prices had
risen by an average 42 per cent compared with 13 per cent for the FT-SE-A
All share Index over the same period. Maybe we ought to launch a Pinchpenny
Pep.
