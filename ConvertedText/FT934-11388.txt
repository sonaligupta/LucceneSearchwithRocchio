FT  01 NOV 93 / Slow recovery on the runway: High losses and liberalisation
are forcing airlines to restructure


   By PAUL BETTS and DAVID GARDNER


Some stark financial numbers will dominate today's annual gathering of the
world airline industry in Dallas, Texas.
Mr Pierre Jeanniot, the director-general of the International Air Transport
Association (Iata), will report to the organisation's 221 airline members
that they lost Dollars 11.5bn on international scheduled services alone
between 1990 and 1992: more than all the net profits made by the industry
since international airline services began just after the first world war.
The combined industry losses are even bigger if domestic services and other
activities are included, swelling the total to Dollars 15.9bn for the same
three-year period.
Although extensive cost cutting and restructuring, coupled with a slow but
steady recovery in air travel after the Gulf conflict in 1991, have started
improving the industry's overall outlook, Mr Jeanniot expects airlines to
report another big loss this year.
'It will be surprising if Iata members' losses in 1993 are less than half of
those in 1992,' he says. That would put 1993 airline losses on international
services at Dollars 2.4bn-Dollars 2.5bn after a record deficit of Dollars
4.8bn last year.
All this financial agony combined with increasing liberalisation has forced
the pace of profound structural change. Direct employment has fallen by some
80,000 people and about 1,000 aircraft deliveries were cancelled or deferred
last year as carriers continued to reduce costs by eliminating marginal
operations, increase sub-contracting and concentrate on their core airline
business, according to Iata's annual report.
They have also had to adapt to changing consumer demands fuelled by
increasing cost consciousness in all sectors of the economy. This has led to
an overall decrease in fares, (in real terms, the economy fare between New
York and London is now half what it was in 1950), a reduction in first-class
services, improved business-class services and growing demand for more
low-cost leisure travel seats.
Perhaps the most significant trend has been the scramble for mergers and
alliances, with airlines seeking to position themselves in an increasingly
global and deregulated market. The list of partnership agreements completed
or under negotiation keeps growing. Lufthansa of Germany last month forged a
strategic link with United Airlines of the US; negotiations between
Swissair, SAS, KLM and Austrian Airlines to combine their operations have
reached a critical stage; and British Airways has bought equity stakes in
USAir, Qantas and two smaller European regional airlines. These are just
some of the bigger deals.
The financial losses of airlines have also provoked 'unique' government
responses, says Iata. 'For the first time, governments on both sides of the
Atlantic have simultaneously recognised the threat to the long-term
viability of aviation as an integrated and global transport system,' Iata
notes in its annual report.
In the US, this has led to the establishment of a presidential commission to
recommend steps to help restore the profitability of US carriers. In Europe,
the EC has set up a committee of 'wise men' which is due to suggest measures
to support the recovery of the European airline industry by the end of the
year.
But these government initiatives have once again raised the threat of a
return to tighter regulations and protectionism. The concerns are
particularly acute in Europe, where many state-owned flag carriers have been
slower to restructure their activities and have been calling for more state
support.
In contrast,the first tentative signs of improvement are emerging in the US
industry, with several carriers, including American Airlines, the biggest US
carrier, reporting profits in the third quarter of this year.
Under pressure from some national flag carriers and their government owners
to reinstate some form of protection for European airlines, the European
Commission has stated that it will resist any attempt to curb liberalisation
in European air transport.
'What some of them are after apparently is a price cartel,' says Mr Karel
van Miert, the Belgian socialist who holds the EC's competition portfolio.
'That, we cannot and will not allow. We won't accept a fare cartel or a
capacity reduction cartel,' he adds, accusing some airlines of 'a certain
nostalgia' for pre-open skies days - the era of airline cartels.
Mr van Miert's warning followed a proposal by Belgium to reintroduce the
capacity-sharing the EC has outlawed as well as Community funding for
airlines in trouble to get round the tougher state aids regime the
Commission is now enforcing.
Belgium has so far received little support for its ideas, except from
France. But the financial plight of most European airlines makes it more
than likely that such proposals will keep resurfacing, bringing new
pressures on the Commission.
Mr van Miert, who, as transport commissioner, last year pushed through the
third phase of EC airline deregulation, is clearly not prepared to see
liberalisation rolled back. He also has the backing of air transport
liberals led by the UK and the Netherlands.
Echoing these views, Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chairman, told the EC 'wise
men' that the European airline industry must be supported by policies which
enhance competition. He added that capacity should be limited by market
forces and not by voluntary agreement between airlines and that the
restructuring of the European industry should be allowed to continue to
enable airlines to improve their competitiveness. If airlines could not
manage this, they should 'go out of business', Sir Colin argued.
The Commission's analysis is that Europe's airlines have to reduce costs and
consolidate into stronger alliances capable of taking on US and Asian
carriers. Brussels is prepared to help, but only within the structure of
deregulation.
The EC has, for instance, started investigations into monopolies for ground
services, such as baggage handling and refuelling at airports in Spain,
Italy and Germany. Liberalisation in these areas would reduce airline costs.
So too would any success in the Commission and industry's campaign to unify
Europe's costly and fragmented air traffic control system.
On state aid, the EC has in the past two years approved recapitalisations
for Air France, Sabena, the Belgian airline, and Iberia of Spain. But
approval was tied to restructuring plans with the EC warning these airlines
they could not come back for more state aid in the future.
Air France, however, is again seeking fresh funds from its state shareholder
as part of a restructuring programme which has provoked fierce reaction from
its trade unions. Brussels will now also have to decide whether to let
through government cash injections for Aer Lingus, Olympic Airways of Greece
and probably TAP, the Portuguese airline.
But the rearguard action by some European flag carriers to win more state
support and re-introduce some of the old capacity and fares regulations is
unlikely to halt the trend towards more 'open skies'. 'I think we are now
too far down the road to reverse the process,' says Sir Colin.
For Iata, air traffic congestion at airports and in the air remains 'the
greatest long-term threat' to the industry. 'Lack of infrastructure could
limit both the size and scope of the future industry,' it says in its annual
report.
The scale of the infrastructure challenge is simply put. Last year, the
airlines carried more than 300m international scheduled passengers. Even
after scaling back earlier long-term air travel forecasts made before the
latest crisis, Iata still expects average annual growth of 6.6 per cent
between now and 1997. If this latest forecast proves correct, Iata estimates
that 114m more people will be flying in 1997 than did in 1992.
The implications are clear. Without adequate new airport and air traffic
control investments, the industry's wings will be clipped just as it starts
showing signs of financial recovery.
