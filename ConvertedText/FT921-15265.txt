FT  11 JAN 92 / UK Company News: S&N saves Dollars 59m as it settles action
for Dollars 37.5m


   By DANIEL GREEN


SMITH & NEPHEW, the healthcare company, yesterday settled a long-running
legal dispute with a Californian company for a fraction of the Dollars 96.2m
(Pounds 52.8m) awarded against it by US courts.
The settlement is for Dollars 37.5m, resulting in a net after-tax cost to
S&N of Pounds 14m.
'This removes a big uncertainty for investors and a waste of time for
management,' said Mr John Robinson, S&N's chief executive.
S&N was ordered in May 1990 to pay a Dollars 96.2m damages award to Polteco,
a research and development company. Polteco had claimed that S&N had
misappropriated technical know-how on materials used in artificial joints.
S&N appealed against the award.
Yesterday's settlement will be treated as an extraordinary item in S&N's
1991 accounts.
Mr Mark Brewer at broker Credit Lyonnais Laing said: 'Gearing at the end of
1991 was 30 per cent.' He estimated that if S&N had been made to pay the
Dollars 96.2m then it would have risen to 40 per cent.
S&N shares rose 1 3/4 p to 143p, their highest level for more than two
years. This built on the 5p gain made on Thursday following the accidental
mailing of the information on the legal settlement to the City of London
office of Banque Paribas.
'The press release came from the distribution arm of our public relations
consultant,' said Mr Robinson. 'We are still checking the causes.'
The company was forced to say on Thursday afternoon that a settlement had
not yet been reached.
The dispute had its origin in 1987, when Smith & Nephew Richards, S&N's US
subsidiary, signed a Dollars 140,000 agreement with Polteco to research and
develop a longer-lasting material for use on the surfaces of its implant
components.
