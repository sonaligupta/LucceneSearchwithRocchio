FT  21 JUL 94 / International Company News: Allstate bounces back for record


   By PATRICK HARVERSON


   NEW YORK


Allstate, the US insurance group whose first-quarter results were hit by the
Los Angeles earthquake in January, yesterday announced record second-quarter
net income of Dollars 402m, up from Dollars 396.7m in the same period of
1993.
The strong earnings represented a sharp rebound from the Dollars 275.2m loss
in the first three months of the year.
Net income on a per share basis was 89 cents in the quarter, down on the 94
cents a share income in the same period of 1993 due to an increase in the
number of shares outstanding.
For the first six months, Allstate earned Dollars 126.8m, or 28 cents a
share, down sharply from the Dollars 716.8m, or Dollars 1.70, in the first
half of 1993.
The decline was attributed to the cost of meeting more than Dollars 1bn of
claims from the Los Angeles earthquake and the severe winter storms which
hit large areas of the east coast in January and February.
Property and liability operations reported net income of Dollars 355.1m,
slightly lower than a year earlier because of higher catastrophe losses, but
still strong thanks to favourable trends in vehicle claims and expense
reductions. Life insurance operations reported a modest increase in net
income to Dollars 56.9m.
Allstate shares rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 24 7/8 on the New York Stock
Exchange yesterday.
ITT, the US conglomerate with significant insurance operations, yesterday
reported second-quarter net income of Dollars 258m, or Dollars 1.97 a share,
down from Dollars 267m, or Dollars 2.02, a year earlier.
Mr Rand Araskog, chairman, said all three of the group's largest business
areas - financial services, manufactured products and hotels - registered
impressive sales growth in the quarter.
