FT  14 APR 94 / Howard defends 'silence' ruling


Changes in the criminal law which will permit juries to draw inferences from
the refusal of a defendant to answer questions put to him by the police were
approved by the Commons last night.
Protests by opposition MPs and some Conservative backbenchers that the
changes amounted to a fundamental constitutional change abolishing the
'right to silence' were denied by Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary.
