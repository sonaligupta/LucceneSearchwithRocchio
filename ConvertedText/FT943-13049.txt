FT  21 JUL 94 / London Tec chiefs resist merger plan


   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff


Chairmen of the nine London Training and Enterprise Councils have rejected a
request by the government that they review their structures, including
making formal proposals for mergers.
The request was made by Miss Ann Widdecombe, employment minister, who is
understood to be concerned that some London Tecs are failing to meet
government criteria. Tecs are responsible for delivering government-funded
training programmes and fostering enterprise.
Mr David Hill, chairman of Aztec, based in south London, and the capital's
representative on the Tec national council, said yesterday: 'The London Tecs
will not be reviewing their structure in response to the government's recent
suggestion, but they will continue to collaborate and improve their
service.'
It is understood that the Tecs believe that any discussions about their
futures should not start with a carve-up of boundaries but rather on what
they are trying to do together and separately.
Tecs in London have been striving to work more closely together, but
achievements on programmes such as Business Links, the umbrella bodies for
business advice, have been modest. It is understood the Tecs are considering
whether to set up a joint secretariat.
