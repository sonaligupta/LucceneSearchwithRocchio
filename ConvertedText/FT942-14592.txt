FT  20 APR 94 / Siemens chief in nuclear plea: European News Digest


   By ANDREW BAXTER


Western companies and countries should work together to help Russia improve
safety standards at its nuclear power stations, Mr Heinrich von Pierer,
chairman of Siemens, the German electrical group, (above) said yesterday.
'There is no need for any further studies, it's like an alibi for not doing
anything,' he said. The issue was too important for normal competitive
factors to have priority, and he would not be against co-operation with Asea
Brown Boveri, Siemens' big European rival in power generating equipment, to
modernise Russia's nuclear stations. Mr von Pierer estimated that it would
cost DM12bn-DM15bn for Russia to modernise its newer nuclear stations, of
which DM5bn would have to be financed abroad. He said gas-fired power
stations were the cheapest and fastest way for Russia to replace its older
nuclear stations. Siemens has a joint venture in St Petersburg, Interturbo,
which is to build four gas turbines for a nearby combined cycle power
station and four more for a plant in Kazakhstan.
