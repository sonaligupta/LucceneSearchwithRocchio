FT  12 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Back to basics approach helps Jessups to
Pounds 0.5m


   By MATTHEW CURTIN


STRINGENT COST cutting and an overhaul of its business strategy returned
Jessups to profitability in the year to August 31, in spite of another year
of declining car sales.
In a Pounds 1.4m turnround, the Romford-based motor dealer reported pre-tax
profits of Pounds 506,000, compared with a Pounds 871,000 loss.
Turnover fell 12 per cent to Pounds 75.9m, but cost reductions led to
operating margins of 3.3 per cent, against 2.7 per cent. Operating profits
were Pounds 2.49m before net interest charges of Pounds 1.98m. Last year's
charge of Pounds 2.71m swallowed operating profits of Pounds 2.33m.
Mr Ron Joseph, managing director, said the group had 'gone back to basics'
and restructured its businesses, including losing some 50 jobs from the
450-strong workforce.
The group was broadening its franchise base, which had been too narrow,
changed the geographical focus of its dealerships and acquired new ones.
Jessups bought the loss-making Clarkes Ford dealership in June and Mr Joseph
said its parts, service and bodyshop business had made a net contribution to
profits, as the group sought to reduce its dependence on retail sales.
Earnings were 1.05p (13.26p deficit) the final dividend of 3p makes an
unchanged 4.5p total.
