FT  05 JUN 92 / People: Trouble Spot Beckett


Mention the name Michael Beckett and trouble is not normally far away. Hence
a few eyebrows may be raised by his appointment as deputy chairman of Watts,
Blake, Bearne, the world's biggest ball clay producer.
The 55-year-old ex-managing director of Consolidated Gold Fields seems to
enjoy getting involved with troubled companies and while he hesitates to
call himself a company doctor he confesses to being a 'very independent'
non-executive director.
When the institutions became worried last year about Jock Mackenzie's
stewardship of Tace, the environmental equipment manufacturer, it was
Beckett they turned to for help. He took over the chairmanship and sold the
company to Cambridge Electronic Industries for a handsome profit. A few
months later he had to take over the helm of Ultramar after the previous
well-paid chairman was ousted. Shortly afterwards, Lasmo acquired the
company.
Beckett is also trying to revive the fortunes of Monarch Resources, a
Venezuelan gold mining company, which launched a Pounds 19m rights issue
earlier this week. Beckett was brought in as chairman just over a year ago
following a major boardroom restructuring.
However, he stresses that his deputy chairmanship of Watts, Blake, Bearne is
a far less controversial appointment and is more akin to his non-executive
directorships of Ranks Hovis McDougall and BPB Industries.
Profits at what is in some respects still a family-run business have fallen
for two years running, and it was the big continental European shareholders
 -with around 45 per cent of the equity - who approached Beckett for this
position.
All the same, WBB is not another Tace or Ultramar and Beckett's appointment
further rounds out the board's expertise. Ingram Lenton, a former chairman
of Bowater Industries, took over the chairmanship of the company just over a
year ago.
