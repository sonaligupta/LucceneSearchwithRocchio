FT  23 OCT 92 / People: Insurance moves


Raymond Hunter, appointed active underwriter of Sturge syndicate 122 this
week, is one of a selected band of qualified actuaries to occupy prominent
positions at the Lloyd's of London insurance market.
Hunter, 45, is an experienced insurer of North American liability insurance
and an expert in medical malpractice, lines of insurance where the ability
to calculate the right level of reserves is vitally important. A mathematics
graduate and an Associate of the Institute of Actuaries, Hunter was formerly
senior underwriter of non-marine special risks at Terra Nova Insurance.
Terry Hayday, the chief executive of Sturge Holdings, which manages
syndicate 122, describes Hunter as 'clear in his ideas and clean cut' and
says that members' agents - who channel Names into syndicates - have been
impressed by his style.
In a separate move, Colin Owen, 41, has been appointed deputy chairman of
Sturge motor and personal risks. Owen has been at Lloyd's since 1967 and is
active underwriter of syndicate 718. Owen is also chairman of the Lloyd's
Non-marine Association's personal accident sub-committee.
*****
Ian Offor, general manager (sales) has been promoted to chief executive of
ROYAL SCOTTISH ASSURANCE; he succeeds Bill Stewart who remains on the board
as deputy chairman but is returning after a three year secondment to
Scottish Equitable.
