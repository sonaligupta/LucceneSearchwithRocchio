FT  20 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Technology and banking
sectors weak


   By FRANK MCGURTY


   NEW YORK


Wall Street
Banking and technology stocks swooned yesterday after investors finished
sifting through an avalanche of corporate results, writes Frank McGurty in
New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 7.12 easier at 3,748.31, its
lowest level of the day, while the more broadly based Standard & Poor's 500
was off 1.36 at 453.86. New York SE trading volume was 251m shares. The
Nasdaq composite declined 3.30 to 719.32, while the American SE composite
held on to a gain of 1.31, closing at 433.90.
Although earnings news buffeted some individual share prices, market indices
were nearly static for most of the session. Anticipation of today's
congressional testimony by Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman,
seemed to be restraining activity.
Some investors were concerned that Mr Greenspan would say something to upset
the bond market, which was expecting the central banker to signal that
monetary policy was on hold for the time being. On the other hand, if he
were to send out comforting signals, stocks could respond with a more
decisive move higher.
There was only a shred of economic data released yesterday, and it offered
little guidance. The Commerce Department said the US trade deficit in May
had widened to Dollars 9.17bn from the previous month's Dollars 8.5bn.
Analysts interpreted the development as evidence of a cooling economy,
reinforcing expectations that Mr Greenspan's appearance on Capitol Hill
would clear the air for a rally.
In the meantime, investors had plenty of corporate news to keep them
occupied, and by the end of the session, the losers began to pile up.
Banking and financial services issues were under the general pressure after
Citicorp disappointed the market with its second-quarter results. The group
posted a slight decline in second-quarter revenues and Wall Street responded
by marking down the issue Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 40 5/8 .
Chase Manhattan suffered from a delayed reaction to the publication of its
results the previous session. The stock fell Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 36 1/8
after finishing unchanged on Monday.
Merrill Lynch shed a net Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 36 1/4 . In early trading
the stock was down as much as Dollars 1 5/8 as the investment house revealed
that its revenues and net income were substantially lower than year-earlier
levels.
Signet, a regional banking group, dropped Dollars 4 1/2 to Dollars 36 3/8
when its results came in below expectations.
Technology issues came under fire, partly in response to news that Intel's
profit margins had shrunk. The announcement by the industry bellwether had
been made just after Monday's close.
Intel fell Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 57, although supported somewhat by the
fact that it had achieved record net income in the quarter. Novellus Systems
weakened Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 35 5/8 .
Elsewhere on the Nasdaq, Lotus Development was rocked after revealing net
income of 20 cents a share in the quarter, against analysts' forecasts of 22
cents. The stock, which had fallen sharply last month when the company
issued a profits warning, plunged a further 14 per cent, or Dollars 5 5/8 ,
yesterday to Dollars 33 1/8 .
Amgen, the biotechnology concern, forged ahead Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 49
7/8 . Its net income of 77 cents per share easily beat the consensus
forecast of 73 cents.
Canada
The Toronto market closed virtually unchanged after moderate trading in
spite of a sharp increase in gold stocks.
The TSE 300 composite index was up just 0.3 of a point at 4,200.1, with
advances narrowly leading declines by 373 to 355. Volume amounted to 52.1m
shares valued at CDollars 604.3m. The gold shares index advanced 1.81 per
cent.
Midland Walwyn retreated CDollars  7/8 to CDollars 9 1/4 after announcing
that it will purchase a majority stake in Financial Concept Group, a
financial planning firm, for an undisclosed amount. Separately, Midland
Walwyn reported disappoint-ing second-quarter earnings which were below
analysts' expectations.
