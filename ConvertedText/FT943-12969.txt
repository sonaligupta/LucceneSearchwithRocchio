FT  22 JUL 94 / Washington drops spy chip plan


   By KEN WARN


   WASHINGTON


The Clinton administration has abandoned its effort to force the computer
industry to introduce a semiconductor known as a clipper chip, which would
have let intelligence services eavesdrop on the information superhighway,
Ken Warn writes from Washington.
The chip, developed by the National Security Agency, would have made it
possible for users of personal computers to scramble or encrypt their
communications, but would also have allowed law enforcement or security
agencies to tap in.
The administration's change of mind emerged in a letter, released this week,
from Vice President Al Gore to Representative Maria Cantwell, whose
Washington state district is home to Microsoft computer software company,
which vehemently opposed the clipper chip.
The chip remained the desired standard for telephone communications, Mr
Gore's letter said, but not for computer exchanges. The administration would
continue to work with the industry on a voluntary encryption standard.
