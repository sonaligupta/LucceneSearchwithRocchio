FT  06 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Burton rationalises Champion


   By NEIL BUCKLEY


BURTON, the retail group, is selling part of its Champion Sport chain to
Cobra Sports for Pounds 2m and reducing Champion's operations to its outlets
within Debenhams.
The rationalisation is the latest in a series of reforms undertaken by Mr
John Hoerner, the American chief executive appointed in February 1992, aimed
at turning the group around.
Champion's stand alone stores are expected to increase their losses to
Pounds 3m for the year to August 28, although the Debenhams outlets are
profitable.
The rationalisation will result in an exceptional charge of Pounds 5m,
consisting mainly of property write-off costs. Analysts are now forecasting
full-year profits for Burton of between Pounds 30m and Pounds 40m, up from
Pounds 9.4m last year.
Mr Richard North, finance director, admitted yesterday that the Champion
chain, formed after Burton acquired Debenhams in 1985, had 'never really
been profitable as a whole entity.'
The sportswear market had been made tough by the recession and lower demand
for branded merchandise.
Cobra, the independent sports retailer, has bought 31 of Champion's 43
stores for Pounds 2m, and will take on their 400 staff and management.
The remaining 12 stores will be sold or converted into other Burton group
outlets.
