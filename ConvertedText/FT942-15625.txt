Forget the Goyas in the Prado. Highlight of Russian President Boris
Yeltsin's three-day trip to Spain was a sausage factory on the outskirts of
Madrid where the owner speaks Russian.
Spain's secret antipasto weapon at the Campofrio company, whose glistening
pipes spout out mortadella and chorizo, was a natural taster on Yeltsin's
programme. Pedro Ballve, the boss, opened a sausage-producing joint venture
in Moscow four years ago, and plans to have a second plant up and running at
the end of this month.
The company has apparently made a hit with the Moscow housewife by marketing
tinned tushonka pork, a concoction of 25 per cent meat and 75 per cent fat
to be heated up and added to potato stew. 'We know all about this because we
started up in Spain's hungry '40s,' Ballve explains. 'Hungry people really
value fat, not meat.'
But Campofrio is not the first to bring tushonka to Russian soil. The stuff
was a staple of the Wehrmacht's iron rations.
