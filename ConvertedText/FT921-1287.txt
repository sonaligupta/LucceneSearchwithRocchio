FT  25 MAR 92 / UK Company News: British Sugar in venture talks with US
producer


   By MAGGIE URRY


BRITISH SUGAR, the sugar beet refining and marketing group, is in talks with
the Californian & Hawaiian Sugar Company about a possible partnership.
C&H is owned by the Hawaiian cane sugar growers on a co-operative basis. The
growers send their raw cane to C&H's San Franciscan refinery for processing
and distribution. C&H is the leading brand of sugar in the west of the US.
The refinery produces about 600,000 tonnes of sugar a year making it one of
the largest in the world. British Sugar, which Associated British Foods
acquired in January last year, is discussing a tie-up giving it a stake in
the refining and distribution business.
Mr Peter Jackson, managing director of British Sugar, said he could not
disclose any details of the discussions.
British Sugar has begun due diligence investigations and a deal was expected
by the summer. He said that British Sugar could bring both technical and
marketing expertise. C&H might benefit from a change of control from a
co-operative to a company.
Analysts suggested that British Sugar would want at least a 50 per cent
stake in the joint venture, which might be worth Dollars 100m (Pounds 58m)
judging by recent acquisitions in the US sugar refining business.
C&H's annual turnover is Dollars 405m. Profits are not disclosed, but
similar refineries can make Dollars 40m to Dollars 60m.
