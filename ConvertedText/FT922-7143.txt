FT  20 MAY 92 / International Company News: Automotive lights group down 20%
to Y2.7bn


   By NEIL WEINBERG


KOITO Manufacturing, Japan's top maker of automotive lighting equipment,
suffered a 28 per cent drop in pre-tax profits, to Y5.3bn (Dollars 39.84m)
for the year ended March. The result reflects the first fall in domestic
sales of cars and trucks in over a decade.
Net profits were off 19.8 per cent to Y2.7bn.
The close Toyota Motor affiliate attributed the lower profits to increased
expenses associated with new product launches, higher depreciation, and the
need to source a greater share of parts outside the company due to labour
shortages.
Sales rose 12.8 per cent to Y162bn, with new products and high-mount tail
lights and other safety equipment leading the gains.
Auto-lighting sales were up 13 per cent to Y149.4bn; aircraft parts 11.8 per
cent to Y2.9bn; and other products 12.4 per cent to Y9.6bn.
Exports to the US remained dull due to rising local production by Japanese
car-makers and the slow economic recovery. However, shipments were brisk to
the Middle East and Central and South America.
For the year ended March 1993, Koito expects sales to rise 5.6 per cent to
Y171.5bn. Pre-tax profits are forecast to fall 7 per cent to Y4.8bn, and net
profits 32 per cent to Y2.3bn.
