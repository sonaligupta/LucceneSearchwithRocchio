FT  13 NOV 93 / Levitt 'tried to blame others'


   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent


MR ROGER LEVITT, former chairman of the collapsed financial services group,
tried to blame others for the fraudulent activities of his company, it was
alleged at the Old Bailey yesterday.
Mr David Cocks QC, prosecuting, said that when first interviewed by police
Mr Levitt told them that everything had been done 'behind his back'.
Mr Cocks said that during these interviews Mr Levitt seemed to be placing
blame on everyone's shoulders except his own.
This was completely untrue, he said, since Mr Levitt was at the heart of the
fraud which involved illegally injecting Pounds 21m into the ailing company,
forging bogus invoices to cover these funds and misleading Fimbra, the
self-regulatory organisation for independent financial advisers, about the
state of the Levitt Group's financial affairs.
Mr Levitt and three other former directors, Mr Mark Reed, Mr Alan McNamara
and Mr Robert Price, all deny a charge of fraudulent trading between April
1989 and December 1990.
Mr Cocks said Mr Levitt's blatant dishonesty was demonstrated by the
deception practised on his 'great personal friend', the thriller writer Mr
Frederick Forsyth.
At a meeting between the two men in May 1990 the author had agreed to invest
Pounds 400,000 in bonds with the Levitt Group and wrote a cheque on the
spot.
The money was placed in the Levitt Group's own accounts, however, rather
than clients' accounts, to help keep it afloat, Mr Cocks said.
A false invoice was then created which claimed Mr Forsyth had paid the money
in return for 'commercial advice and negotiations on book rights'. Mr
Forsyth would be called as a witness and tell the court this documentation
was 'complete moonshine', Mr Cocks said. 'You couldn't have a more blatant
example, the prosecution say, of dishonesty,' he told the court.
The trial continues.
