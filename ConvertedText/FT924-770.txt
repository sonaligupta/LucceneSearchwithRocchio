FT  22 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Extra time for banks responses to Isosceles


   By MAGGIE URRY


SOME MEMBERS of the 38 strong banking group which has loans of Pounds 1bn to
Isosceles, the parent of the Gateway food retail chain, have been given
extra time to respond to the company's request for a standstill on interest
and capital repayments.
Responses were due to be delivered by this morning, and an Isosceles board
meeting was scheduled for this afternoon to approve the standstill. However,
overseas banks have been allowed an extra day to reply, delaying an
announcement that an agreement has been signed until at least tomorrow.
Pressure is on the company and its lenders to come to an agreement before
Christmas, as suppliers are nervous of extending trade credit to the Gateway
chain while its future remains uncertain. Followers of Isosceles recall that
details of its first financial restructuring were posted to shareholders on
Christmas Eve 1990.
