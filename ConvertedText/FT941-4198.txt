FT  12 MAR 94 / Moi climbdown on Leakey

Mr Richard Leakey, Kenya's foremost conservationist, was yesterday back in
charge of the Kenya Wildlife Service after international pressure for his
reinstatement prevailed over a vilification campaign conducted by
politicians of the ruling Kanu party. President Daniel arap Moi said he
would not accept Mr Leakey's resignation, submitted in January, following
accusations of racism, arrogance and corruption by Mr William ole Ntimama,
the powerful minister for local government. Diplomats, donors and tour
operators warned President Moi that Mr Leakey's departure would do
incalculable damage to Kenya's reputation as a world leader in wildlife
conservation, which underpins a Dollars 450m-a-year tourist industry. Mr
Leakey is said to have placed some tough conditions for his return,
including the removal of his fiercest political opponents.
