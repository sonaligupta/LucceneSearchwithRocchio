FT  15 APR 94 / Black joblessness blamed on race bias


   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent


Discrimination is the main reason why black people in Britain face an
unemployment rate three times as high as that facing whites, according to a
Trade Union Congress report on black workers in the labour market published
today.
'What recovery there has been in the labour market has completely bypassed
the black workforce,' said Mr John Monks, general secretary, yesterday.
'Evidence suggests they are the last to be hired and the first to be fired.'
The study suggests the sort of jobs black workers do does not provide a
explanation for the higher unemployment rate.
It says black workers are mainly under-represented in recession-prone
industries such as construction. The report says: 'The geographical
concentration of ethnic minority workers can only explain some of the
differences. Nor can lack of qualifications be a convincing explanation.'
