FT  30 JUN 93 / UN resolution to rearm Moslems faces defeat


   By MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS, UN Correspondent

A renewed attempt by Islamic states on the UN Security Council to lift the
arms embargo against the Bosnian Moslems appeared headed for defeat last
night, despite US support.
Britain, France and Russia all opposed the resolution and Moscow threatened
to exercise its veto, if necessary, to block approval. However, that course
seemed unlikely because even the most optimistic of the sponsors questioned
whether the measure could command the required minimum of nine votes in
favour.
American backing for the text - drafted by Pakistan, Morocco and Djibouti -
was obtained through the deletion of a paragraph authorising UN forces to
launch air strikes against Bosnian Serb artillery positions. Opponents of
the resolution believe that rearming the Bosnian Moslems would serve only to
intensify and prolong the conflict that has defied all UN peacekeeping
efforts.
Britain and France, which between them have about 7,700 soldiers serving
with the UN in former Yugoslavia - mostly in Bosnia - are also concerned
that lifting the arms embargo or conducting air strikes would endanger their
own troops on the ground.
Given the resolution's almost certain fate, the sponsors drew comfort from
the prospect of a split in the ranks as the US reaffirmed its belief in
rearming Bosnian Moslems.
