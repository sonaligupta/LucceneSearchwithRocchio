FT  21 APR 94 / IMF World Economic Outlook: Much better, but must try harder
 -A call for all countries to work hard to boost recovery


   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor


The good news in the International Monetary Fund's latest World Economic
Outlook is that the global economy is heading for stronger growth.
But all countries - industrialised, developing and those former communist
states in transition to market-based economies - must work hard to stay
competitive and participate in the economic revival.
Because nations are in very different stages of growth and development, the
advice dispensed in the Outlook is almost as varied as the IMF's 178
members.
Each of the three groups of nations analysed includes some that are doing
well and some that are doing badly. Some of the most pertinent parts of the
200-page report tell the laggards how to improve their performance.
The main industrial countries are at different stages of the business cycle
but should come closer to convergence in 1995. The US is growing strongly
and the UK and Canada are recovering well. But while the output decline in
continental Europe and Japan 'may have come to a halt, prospects for a
meaningful recovery are still fragile'.
Recovery is not expected to get under way in Germany before the middle of
this year, the IMF warns. In Japan, where the IMF has cut its forecast of
growth this year to 0.7 per cent from 2 per cent last October, it says
margins of slack could grow further this year.
The IMF hopes for a 'a continued cautious but significant lowering' of
German short-term interest rates. It calls on Japan to deregulate and open
its home market to increase living standards and consumer confidence.
All industrialised countries are urged to use the forthcoming period of
economic expansion to reduce their budget deficits and push through
fundamental labour market reforms. The recent increase in long-term rates
could be a signal that extra efforts are needed to cut budget deficits, it
says.
The Fund calls on the US to act, warning that a continuing structural
deficit of 2 to 3 per cent of gross domestic product could impede 'business
investment, job creation, future growth and improvement in the external
position'. The report, written before this week's increase in US short-term
interest rates, approves of the monetary tightening initiated in February.
Further action 'would seem appropriate'.
The developing nations fall into two camps. There is a fast-growing
successful majority that are building on macro-economic stability, good
governance and market oriented policies and achieving added dynamism through
increased trade with each other. There is also a group of low growth, poor
laggards whose problems are 'truly daunting' but not hopeless.
There is no easy solution to the problems of the slow growing developing
nations, many of which are in Africa. But the Fund cites high and variable
inflation, overvalued currencies, excessive fiscal deficits and import
controls as factors behind a failure to catch up. The lack of a stable
environment for economic decision making has been exacerbated in some cases
by 'poor governance and considerable social and political instability'.
Some countries such as Angola, Ethiopia, Mozambique and Somalia suffer
extensive war damage.
Those countries undergoing the difficult transition from communism to
capitalism also fall into two groups. Some, such as Poland and the Baltic
states, are showing signs of economic recovery founded on 'a reasonable
measure of macroeconomic stability and significant progress in structural
reform'. Others, notably Russia and most of the former Soviet republics, are
experiencing a continued deterioration in economic conditions.
The IMF believes the process of transition is 'in most important respects,
essentially irreversible'. But the very expansionary monetary and fiscal
policies pursued by countries such as Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, have not
mitigated the large declines in output associated with the process of
transition. Instead, they have aggravated already difficult economic and
social conditions by fueling near hyperinflation that has stimulated capital
flight and deterred foreign investment.
The IMF partly blames the lack of progress towards macro-economic
stabilisation in Russia and other former Soviet republics on a lack of
sufficient adjustment at company level and the failure of the authorities to
resist demands from industry and agriculture for large-scale financial
support.
In spite of these problems, the IMF forecasts that the world economic growth
will quicken to 3 per cent this year from 2.3 per cent in 1993 and
accelerate further to 3.7 per cent in 1995. While growth in the
industrialised nations is forecast at around 2.5 per cent this year and
next, the IMF expects the developing world will grow by nearly 6 per cent.
As a group, the transition countries are expected to return to growth of 1.4
per cent next year compared with an anticipated drop in overall output of 6
per cent this year.
