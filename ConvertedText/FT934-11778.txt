FT  29 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Acquisitive Danka turns in 91% advance to
Pounds 13.3m


   By PEGGY HOLLINGER


DANKA BUSINESS Systems, the acquisitive office equipment supplier which is
based in the US and quoted in London, yesterday reported a 91 per cent jump
in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 13.3m, largely due to exchange rates
and a string of acquisitions.
The surge in profits for the six months to September 30 was achieved on the
back of a 90 per cent increase in sales to Pounds 141.1m
In dollar terms, Danka's pre-tax profits rose by 54 per cent to Dollars
18.9m. Mr Dan Doyle, chief executive, said the group had shown a 16 per cent
increase in dollar sales and profits before acquisitions.
Danka paid Pounds 36m for 13 companies during the half year, including its
first company in the UK, which contributed total operating profits of Pounds
1.2m and sales of Pounds 21.2m. The acquisitions resulted in a Pounds 22m
goodwill write off, increasing the drain on reserves from Pounds 24.8m to
Pounds 46.9m.
Net assets declined from Pounds 21.2m to Pounds 19.2m, partly due to an
increase in stocks and debtors. Mr Mark Vaughan Lee, chairman, said Danka
had built stocks when prices rose due to exchange rate movements. However,
he said, the group was confident it would be able to maintain operating
margins.
The group has cash of Dollars 8m, and no short term debt, following this
month's Dollars 86m share issue and a refinancing of longer-term borrowings.
At the end of September, Danka had long-term debt of Pounds 69.3m (Pounds
11.4m).
Danka doubled its interim dividend from 0.375p to 0.75p. Earnings rose by 34
per cent to 4.1p.
