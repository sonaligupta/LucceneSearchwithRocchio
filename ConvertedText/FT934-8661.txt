FT  13 NOV 93 / International Company News: QVC steps up bid for Paramount
to Dollars 10.8bn

   NEW YORK


QVC Network, the cable television company headed by Mr Barry Diller,
yesterday increased the value of its hostile takeover bid for entertainment
group Paramount Communications from around Dollars 9.5bn to Dollars 10.8bn.
The new bid, totalling Dollars 90 a share, tops the Dollars 85-a-share offer
on the table from Viacom, the cable group which has agreed to a friendly
takeover of Paramount.
Viacom will have to decide whether to increase its bid for Paramount a third
time, weighing up the rarity value of one of Hollywood's few remaining
independent film studios against bid prices which many Wall Street analysts
suggest are now in the realm of the uneconomic.
QVC, which was in the middle of a cash tender offer for 51 per cent of
Paramount's shares, increased the price it will pay for these shares from
Dollars 80 to Dollars 90, which will involve a cash outlay of Dollars 5.5bn
for 61m shares. The tender runs to November 26.
If its tender offer is successful it will then offer shareholders 1.43 QVC
common shares and 0.32 shares of new convertible preferred stock for every
Paramount share.
The next important date in QVC's bid will be on Tuesday, when the company
appears before a court in Delaware seeking to overturn special 'lock up'
provisions of the Viacom-Paramount merger agreement. It said the revised
offer was conditional on success in court.
The lock-ups allow Viacom to buy 20 per cent of Paramount's stock at a price
of just Dollars 69.14 a share in certain circumstances. QVC is demanding
that the court create a level playing field between the two bids.
The new bid comes just 24 hours after BellSouth, the US regional
telecommmunications company, joined QVC Network's war party by agreeing to
invest Dollars 1.5bn in QVC if it acquires Paramount.
