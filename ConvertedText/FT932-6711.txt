EXPERT SYSTEMS are also known as knowledge-based systems, KBS. An offshoot
of early artificial intelligence (AI) research, they are rule-based, using
the answers entered by users to refine the information and prompt the next
question.
An expert system 'shell' such as Crystal provides the KBS developer with a
framework linking questions, rules and screens. The rules are often derived
from one human expert and can include uncertainties, usually expressed as
percentages.
