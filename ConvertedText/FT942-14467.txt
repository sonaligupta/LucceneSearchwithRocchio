FT  20 APR 94 / UK Company News: Lombard Insurance coming to market with
Pounds 65m valuation


   By SIMON DAVIES


The forthcoming flotation of Lombard Insurance Group will value the company
at more than Pounds 65m, compared with the Pounds 32m at which it was
purchased from Continental Inc in a management buy-out last May.
Lombard is forecasting pre-tax profits of Pounds 8.65m for the year to June
1994, up from Pounds 5.68m in the previous 12 months, as a result of
increased investment income and steady growth in gross premium income.
The company is emerging from what has been an exceptionally tough period for
the industry, having lost money on underwriting in both 1991 and 1992.
However, in the three years to December 1993, it achieved underwriting
margins - underwriting profit/loss as a percentage of net premium income -
significantly better than large insurers, such as Commercial Union and Sun
Alliance. Underwriting income grew by 67 per cent during that period.
Lombard is a regional insurance company which has avoided the volatile
London insurance market and concentrated on low to moderate risk insurance.
In 1993, some 65 per cent of premiums were for personal insurance with the
remainder from small and medium-sized businesses.
It has concentrated on short tail business, where the claims are likely to
emerge within the period of cover. However, it has an indemnity from
Continental, covering any claims from business undertaken before the May
1993 buy-out.
The company will issue shares through a placing and intermediaries offer.
The proceeds, after costs and the redemption of outstanding preference
shares, will be Pounds 16m.
The company said the flotation would raise its profile, and the proceeds
enable it to achieve a solvency margin similar to other listed insurers.
The pricing of the issue will be announced on May 5, and dealings are
expected to commence on May 18.
