FT  05 JUN 92 / Letter: Maastricht, A 'Perot factor' strikes a chord in
Europe


   From J G BYE


Sir, There are a few of us who think your front page headline 'Denmark says
no to Maastricht' should read 'Thank you Denmark']
Dare we sceptics hope our politicians will now give us the opportunity of
expressing our verdict by a referendum?
