FT  27 SEP 94 / People: Foley quits Triplex Lloyd


The managerial merry-go-round at Triplex Lloyd, the West Midlands
engineering group, took another whirl yesterday as John Foley stepped out as
group managing director and Graham Lockyer stepped in.
Lockyer, 47, a former Dowty executive, joined Triplex Lloyd only in July as
group operations director, reporting to Foley. Foley, 38, became finance
director in 1989 and, since 1991, a partner with Colin Cooke, the chairman,
in the reorientation of Triplex Lloyd as a group concentrating on precision
components.
Cooke said there was 'an amicable understanding' with Foley. 'We need a
strong operations guy - we're a very technical company.' Lockyer is just
that in Cooke's view.
Foley's background is accounting and the law, while his talents, according
to Cooke, 'are more on the financial, acquisitions side'.
Foley and Cooke have apparently been talking about Foley's future since
early summer, so Lockyer's arrival foreshadowed Foley's departure. 'I'm
perfectly relaxed about it. I'd like to go off and do other things,' Foley
says.
