FT  17 JAN 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Multimedia finds way to the
bank


   By DAVID BARCHARD


HUNTINGTON Bank, of Columbus, Ohio, is setting up a combined
video-conferencing and interactive service, enabling bank customers to have
instant personal assistance at point-of-sale multimedia terminals, writes
David Barchard.
Huntington is using NCR 5682 self-service multimedia terminals, using
technology developed by AT&T's Bell Laboratories, to enable a standard
telephone cable to transmit both voice and video signals between the bank's
personnel and customers.
The terminal allows customers to review accounts, obtain up-to-date
information on bank products and rates, and perform other functions
previously done by staff.
Contacts:  NCR: UK, 071 725 8337.
