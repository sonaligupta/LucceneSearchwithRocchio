FT  23 NOV 92 / International Company News: Mercedes excess stocks total
35,000


   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent


MERCEDES-Benz, the automotive subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, has excess stocks
of around 35,000 cars worldwide, according to Mr Gerhard Liener,
Daimler-Benz finance director.
Mercedes is holding stocks of around 130,000 cars worldwide in its own
inventories and at its dealers, said Mr Liener, compared with a normal level
of around 95,000. 'Our sales are going down, our stocks are too high and
therefore we are cutting production.'
The German car and commercial vehicle maker is being forced to close its
domestic plants from December 21 to January 8 with the elimination of 10
production days in order to reduce output.
Last week it stopped production at its German commercial vehicle plants with
the loss of four production days, in addition to a public holiday.
Extensive short-time working has been agreed for the commercial vehicle
plants for the first half of 1993, and negotiations have started for
short-time working at the Mercedes car plants in the first quarter of 1993.
A total of 32 production days are to be eliminated at the main van and truck
plants at Dusseldorf and Worth in the first six months of next year, while
19 production days will be cut at the Mannheim bus plant.
Mercedes car workers are taking the extended Christmas break in lieu of part
of the summer holiday, so that the company can speed up output of the new
generation Mercedes-Benz 190 executive car range, when it is launched next
June, Mr Liener said.
By the end of this year the Mercedes workforce would have been reduced by
12,500, he said, and a further 15,000 job cuts were planned in the next two
years - a total reduction of around 10 per cent.
Mr Liener said that the company had suffered a 'dramatic' fall in commercial
vehicle orders booked in Germany since July of between 30 and 50 per cent.
He said that Mercedes car production was expected to fall by 7 per cent this
year to 538,000, from 577,990 in 1991. He forecast a further decline next
year to 520,000-530,000.
Mercedes' commercial vehicle production worldwide would fall to 280,000 this
year from 296,000 in 1991, and it was expected to fall to 270,000 next year,
he said.
Mr Liener said a 'fierce battle' for market share was being fought in some
European truck markets, particularly in France. 'This is a price war and the
fiercest war is in France,' he said.
