FT  24 MAR 92 / Albanian opposition wins majority

   TIRANA


ALBANIA'S opposition Democratic party captured a clear parliamentary
majority in Sunday's general election with 62.2 per cent of the vote against
25.6 per cent for the outgoing Socialist party, the Central Electoral
Commission said, Reuter reports from Tirana.
With tallies from 97 of 100 constituencies counted, there was still no clear
indication of how many seats each party would have under Albania's
sophisticated new electoral system that combined first-past-the-post
elements with proportional representation.
In essence, parties that win more than 4 per cent of the ballot can get
seats equivalent to their share of the vote in the country's new,
slimmed-down 140-seat assembly.
Commission sources said the Democratic party of Mr Sali Berisha - beaten a
year ago when it first attempted to unseat the governing Communist party -
had won 76 seats outright, while the renamed Socialists took only five.
'This has ended a long night of communism,' Mr Berisha said.
With a popular vote of close to 63 per cent the Democratic party could
expect to control around 88 seats in the assembly. The Socialists with
around 25 per cent would have about 36 seats.
