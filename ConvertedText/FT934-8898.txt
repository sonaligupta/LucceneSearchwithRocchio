FT  12 NOV 93 / Wearing down the sceptics to release a flow of money: A look
at progress in raising institutional funds for the Lloyd's insurance market


   By RICHARD LAPPER and NORMA COHEN


News this week that backers of the Nelson Lloyd's Trust were scrapping a
Pounds 60m venture to seek corporate capital for the Lloyd's insurance
market raised eyebrows in London. After all, it is not every day that the
names of Cazenove and Lazard Brothers, the bluest of blue-chip city
institutions, are associated with failure.
And it was a failure all the more galling in view of the success enjoyed by
many rival banks and securities houses. Twelve investment trusts and
companies have been launched in the past three weeks - including two
yesterday. Although some of the funds have been scaled back in size, pension
funds and life assurance companies have already committed more than Pounds
600m to the Lloyd's market for 1994.
Several other schemes are scheduled for launch before the end of this month.
Lloyd's hopes that about Pounds 1bn in corporate capital will be committed.
But even the present level of capital raised represents an achievement for
Lloyd's. As recently as July, officials were cautiously predicting that
Lloyd's could attract as much as Pounds 500m 'with a fair wind and a
following breeze'.
Lloyd's has had to overcome a series of obstacles. New rules meshing its
internal rules with stock market regulations have been drafted against a
tight timetable and senior managers have conducted a delicate political
campaign to persuade existing Names - the individuals who have traditionally
supported its capital base - to approve the initiative.
Above all, the insurance market has persuaded cautious city institutions to
back it. Mr Robert Hiscox, deputy chairman of Lloyd's of London, who has
headed the market's search for corporate capital, says UK financiers
initially poured cold water on the idea. Interest only began to pick up
after US investment banks, such as Salomon Brothers, became involved in
developing schemes.
Managers of many Lloyd's syndicates, who earlier this year feared they had
insufficient capital to stay in business, are now flush with capacity and
turning away potential corporate money. CLM Insurance Fund, sponsored by
Sedgwick Group and Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said recently it had scaled back
its fund because of the difficulty in securing 'good quality' capacity on
Lloyd's syndicates. Two agencies - Sturge Holdings and London Wall Holdings
 -abandoned plans to form their own listed trusts because they had obtained
enough capital from other sources.
Yet the scrapping of the Nelson trust provides the clearest indication that
the supply of capital - as well as the demand for funds - is also limited.
Mr Nigel Rogers, managing director of the Octavian Group, which jointly
sponsored the Nelson initiative, says: 'Institutions have set aside a
certain amount of money but this is not a bottomless pit.'
Indeed, scepticism among the investment community remains widespread.
According to one fund manager who is an enthusiast for Lloyd's, well over
half the UK investment community is not interested at all. Some leading
institutions are firmly set against any involvement.
Sceptics point to the potential volatility of future returns from the trusts
and to a lack of transparency in the character of many of the investments.
'There is a problem explaining to pension fund trustees that you are putting
their money into Lloyd's,' says one fund manager.
One measure of the modest scale of institutional interest is that the Pounds
600m in funds committed to Lloyd's compares with Pounds 350bn available for
investment each year by UK pension funds. The National Association of
Pension Funds (NAPF) considered holding a special seminar on Lloyd's at its
February conference, but abandoned the idea because there was insufficient
interest from members. 'It is interesting that there are a lot of people who
have given these things a wide berth,' says one fund manager.
Many investors have overcome fears about the ability of Lloyd's to create a
reinsurance company to 'ring fence' billions of dollars of liabilities from
US asbestosis and pollution claims. 'There is evidence to suggest that
Lloyd's syndicates are better reserved than the average UK composite,' says
one fund manager. 'We accept that the ring fencing may not fully protect you
from prior year claims, however in a composite there is no protection.'
Even so fund managers are investing relatively small amounts of money. Few
investors are prepared to risk more than Pounds 25m. Smaller funds, such as
Premium Trust/Premium Underwriting, which is raising Pounds 33m to support
40 syndicates, are backed by some two dozen separate institutional investors
with maximum stakes of about Pounds 3m each. One investor who manages Pounds
18bn of funds says he is prepared to put only Pounds 5m-Pounds 10m into one
of the larger Lloyd's trusts.
Even some enthusiasts say they do not see the investments as permanent. 'It
is a marginal investment and not one that we would hold for the entire
cycle,' says one fund manager. 'There is a danger that everyone wants to get
in and get out at the same time,' says another.
Yet whatever the pros and cons, the institutional investment has been
sufficient to spawn a mini stock market sector. Mr Mark Henderson, of
Clerical Medical, the life assurance group, takes a positive view of
prospects for the quoted companies. He says that if Pounds 1bn is raised,
the quoted Lloyd's investment trust sector will be equivalent in size to a
small Footsie stock, a level sufficient to encourage further interest.
