Do the Body Shops really sell better, cleaner, ethically superior products
or do they have more to do with selling the feel-good factor to guilt-ridden
greenies? Dispatches investigates Anita Roddick's company and suggests that
while it claims to be greener, purer, and more opposed to animal testing
than the rest, in reality it 'falls well short of established best practice
in the cosmetics industry' (9.00 C4).
When Britain pays foreigners to join its fighting services they are
described in such terms as 'plucky little Gurkhas' and the BBC makes gung-ho
programmes about their daring exploits. But when foreigners pay British
soldiers to join their fighting services the BBC calls them 'mercenaries
licensed to kill' and says they are 'men attracted to violence'. Inside
Story has a go at what it calls 'The Dogs Of War' who have gone from Britain
to fight for the Croatian Army (9.45 BBC1). In ITV's relay from Covent
Garden, saying Welcome Back St Petersburg (10.40), the Kirov Opera and
Ballet provide a programme of lollipops including extracts from Swan Lake,
Prince Igor, Boris Godunov, The Nutcracker, Le Corsaire and more.
