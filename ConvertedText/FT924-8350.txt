FT  11 NOV 92 / International Company News: JC Penney surges to Dollars 186m
at nine months


   By NIKKI TAIT


J. C. PENNEY, the large Texan retail group, yesterday reported a virtual 60
per cent surge in third-quarter results, with after-tax profits reaching
Dollars 186m, compared with Dollars 116m in the same period of 1991.
According to Mr William Howell, chairman, the group saw improvements across
the board, as stores, catalogue operations and life insurance interests all
posted 'strong earnings performances as compared with last year'.
The group's retail sales during the quarter were up by 10.3 per cent at
Dollars 4.34bn, and gross margins were virtually unchanged year-on-year.
However, the group's selling, general and administrative expenses, as a
percentage of retail sales, improved 'significantly,' suggesting that costs
are under firm control.
Profits for the first nine months of the year were Dollars 402m against
Dollars 227m for the comparable period last time. Penney's shares rose
Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 75 1/2 .
The Limited, which operates specialist chains ranging from Victoria's Secret
to Abercrombie & Fitch, also posted a 10 per cent increase in third-quarter
profits at Dollars 80m after tax.
Sales were 12.4 per cent higher at Dollars 1.43bn.
However, the company admitted performance had varied across its chains, with
the Structure and Lane Bryant faring well, for example, but Victoria's
Secret Stores experiencing 'a significant drop in third-quarter
profitability due largely to fashion errors.'
The Limited's shares eased Dollars  3/8 to close at Dollars 23 3/8 .
