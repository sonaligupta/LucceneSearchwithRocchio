FT  24 AUG 92 / UK Company News: The age-old skill of spinning a yarn


   By DANIEL GREEN


WOOL PROCESSING is an ancient and arcane business that became industrialised
with the spread of steam power about two centuries ago.
Today, wool merchants buy raw wool ('greasy wool') from farmers and usually
commission companies such as Woolcombers to prepare it for spinning into
yarn.
This starts with the blending of fine and coarse fleeces into mixtures that
will end up in knitted or woven clothing or carpets. The finer the wool
filaments, the softer the final garment.
Then the wool is scoured: stirred through a series of tanks of hot water and
detergent. This removes the 'woolgrease', which is skimmed off and refined
into lanolin, and suint - dried sheep's sweat.
The clean wool is then 'carded', or pulled by a series of wire brush rollers
to disentangle the filaments.
In some cases, it is further straightened and aligned by being pulled
through a metal grid in 'gilling' and the shortest filaments - 'noils'  -
removed by 'combing' with a yet finer metal grid.
By this time, the wool is in loose ribbons of fibre without twist called
'slivers'.
Finally, the slivers are coiled into 'tops', usually weighing 10
kilogrammes, compressed and bundled up for shipping to yarn spinners before
being woven or knitted into clothing or carpets.
