FT  16 NOV 93 / Owen queries Bosnia action


   By TONY JACKSON


LORD OWEN, Europe's peace envoy in former Yugoslavia, yesterday warned that
the world community would have to decide how long it could sustain
intervention in the war-torn countries.
In a speech to the Confederation of British Industry in Harrogate, northern
England, Lord Owen said there was a danger that intervening in civil wars
only worsened the situation. 'Europe can help, above all with humanitarian
aid. But let us not forget we are feeding the warriors, we are interfering
with the dynamics of war . . . becoming more and more unjustified as it
becomes a battle for smaller elements of territory, smaller elements of
principle.
'There will come a moment when the world community will have to decide how
long we can sustain intervention.'
Lord Owen argued that the UN could not settle other peoples' problems - 'all
it can do is help them to settle their own problems'. He added: 'You have to
realise that they operate under the same dynamics as we have operated in our
history and rightly or wrongly - and I believe wrongly - these people are
still intent on fighting each other.'
However, no one should feel 'totally ashamed' of what Europe was trying to
do in former Yugoslavia. In response to calls for greater military
intervention, Lord Owen said: 'Do not believe that we can solve the problem
from the safety of 10,000 ft from an aeroplane.' Nonetheless, the European
Union's policy towards former Yugoslavia showed the difficulties of trying
to impose a single foreign policy.
This led to the mistake of recognising Croatia and then Bosnia because
member states wrongly believed they needed to have a common foreign policy.
'It's time to realise that there is no need to feel guilt-ridden if all 12
countries do not make the same decisions.'
