FT  06 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Not a drinking problem


   From Mr PETER MITCHELL


Sir, It is a pity Joe Rogaly's thoughtful article on crime ('Tough talk is
not enough', November 5) is flawed by one significant error. He asserts '. .
. most assaults are caused by drunkenness'. The reality is that this is not
so. Various research, from Britain and elsewhere in Europe, fails to
identify causal links between disorder and excessive drinking. They
sometimes coincide, but the hard evidence that one leads to the other is
negligible.
This is not to down-play proper concern in this or other matters of alcohol
misuse, which the drinks industry seeks to counter. But Mr Rogaly's
'solution' to violence of increased drinks taxation fails on all counts. The
small minority who abuse alcohol are undeterred by excessive pricing; look
at Scandinavia's experience. The 95 per cent or more of us who drink
sensibly are unreasonably penalised. And it picks the wrong target, given
that violence is a complex product of, usually, factors other than
drunkenness.
