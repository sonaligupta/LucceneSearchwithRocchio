FT  25 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Laporte declines 5% to Pounds 97.2m


   By RICHARD GOURLAY


LAPORTE, the specialist chemicals company, yesterday announced details of a
Dollars 60m acquisition and the unwinding of its 21-year-old joint venture
with Solvay of Belgium as it reported profits down only 5 per cent after a
recession hit year.
Pre-tax profits in the year to December 29 fell from Pounds 103m to Pounds
97.2m on sales down 5 per cent at Pounds 615.5m. Earnings per share fell
from 44.4p to 40p and the company is to pay an increased final dividend of
12.1p, giving a total for the year of 33.9p, up 9.4 per cent.
Construction chemicals, organic specialities and the hygiene and process
chemicals division produced significant increases in operating profits.
Metals and electronic chemicals fell slightly while the absorbents division
saw profits more than halve after the loss of one big customer and
commissioning problems with a new plant in Widnes.
As part of the reorganisation of Interox, Laporte's joint venture with
Solvay, the Belgian company yesterday placed an 8.7 per cent stake in
Laporte with a variety of institutions. Laporte cancelled the shares
relating to the 16.3 per cent balance of Solvay's 25 per cent stake in
Laporte.
Solvay took the stake when the joint venture was formed in 1971 to see off a
hostile bid from Burmah Oil.
The reorganisation of Interox leaves Laporte with all the joint venture's
organic peroxides and persulphates business while ownership of the capital
intensive hydrogen peroxide and persalts business will pass to Solvay, the
group said.
Mr Ken Minton, chief executive, said that while Laporte's share of Interox's
pre-tax profits had fallen from Pounds 34.4m to Pounds 30.8m in 1991, the
part of the joint venture it was retaining had actually seen pre-tax profits
rise. The reorganisation should be earnings neutral this year but would
enhance earnings in 1993.
The group said that the removal of Laporte's 25 per cent stake should
introduce a bid premium into Laporte's share price as previously it had been
seen to have been virtually immune from a hostile approach.
Laporte also said it has bought Rockwood, a privately-owned company making
iron oxide-based colouring systems for the US concrete construction and
coating industries.
The buy is being financed by an issue for cash of 7.5m new Laporte shares at
533p, which will raise Pounds 40m. Laporte's shares ended up 10p at 567p.
Rockwood made Dollars 10m pre-tax profits from sales of Dollars 55m in 1991
and Mr Minton said the deal will be earnings enhancing this year.
