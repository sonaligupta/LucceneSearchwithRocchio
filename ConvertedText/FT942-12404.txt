FT  29 APR 94 / UK Company News: Hopkinsons declines by 69% to Pounds
642,000


   By PAUL TAYLOR


Hopkinsons Group, the industrial abrasives, engineering equipment and
plastic products company which issued a profits warning in January,
yesterday reported a further decline in full-year profits, but, as expected,
is maintaining its dividend.
Pre-tax profits fell by 69 per cent to Pounds 642,000 in the year to January
31, down from Pounds 2.06m in 1992 when the group carried an exceptional
charge of Pounds 600,000 covering redundancies at the Bryan Donkin
engineering business.
Turnover slipped to Pounds 99m (Pounds 102.5m), but the decline was
cushioned by exchange rate movements. Based on constant exchange rates,
sales would have fallen by 6.5 per cent to Pounds 95.9m. After a tax credit
of Pounds 287,000 (Pounds 1.02m charge), reflecting German losses and the
release of tax provisions, earnings per share slipped to 1.17p (1.31p).
A final dividend of 0.8p (0.4p) is recommended, making an unchanged total
for the year of 1.3p.
Operating profits fell by 62 per cent to Pounds 1.42m (Pounds 3.79m), partly
reflecting a swing into losses by the abrasives division. Despite success in
exports outside western Europe and cost reductions, the division reported a
Pounds 1.24m loss (Pounds 374,000 profit) on sales which slipped to Pounds
53m (Pounds 53.6m).
Further reductions in demand from the UK gas industry adversely affected the
engineering operations, although this was partly offset by continued
development of export markets. The division reported reduced profits of
Pounds 451,000 (Pounds 2.04m) on turnover of Pounds 24.9m (Pounds 29.1m).
