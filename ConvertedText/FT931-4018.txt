FT  12 MAR 93 / International Company News: Executives rule out interest in
IBM post


   By LOUISE KEHOE


   SAN FRANCISCO


TWO executives widely seen as potential candidates for the post of chief
executive of International Business Machines have issued statements saying
they are not interested in taking the job.
Mr John Sculley, chairman and chief executive of Apple Computer, and Mr
Larry Bossidy, chairman and chief executive of Allied Signal, the US
industrial group, both said they intended to stay in their current posts.
There have been persistent rumours within the computer industry that IBM was
viewing both Mr Sculley and Mr Bossidy as possible successors to Mr John
Akers, who announced in late January he intended to resign once a
replacement was found.
Mr Sculley said: 'I have told Apple's board of directors and our executive
management team that I am not available or interested in being chief
executive of IBM.'
He added: 'Ten years ago this April I signed up to do a job, and there is
still a lot that I would like to accomplish with all of us (at Apple).'
Similarly, Mr Larry Bossidy, chairman and chief executive, said he intended
to remain at Allied Signal 'to complete the job I came here to do'.
But Mr Edward Lucente, a former senior IBM executive, yesterday announced
his resignation from Northern Telecom, where he has been executive
vice-president for the past two years since leaving IBM.
During his 30-year career at IBM, Mr Lucente was occasionally mentioned as a
potential successor to Mr Akers. He headed IBM's extensive Asian operations.
Mr Lucente's departure from Northern Telecom follows that of Mr Paul Stern,
former chairman and chief executive, who resigned in January. Mr Stern is
also a former IBM executive mentioned as a potential candidate for the post
of IBM chief executive.
