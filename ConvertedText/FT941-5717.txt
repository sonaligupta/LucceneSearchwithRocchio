halfway

Amcor, the fast-expanding Australian paper and packaging group which is
currently pushing into Europe and North America, yesterday reported profits
before tax and abnormals of ADollars 251.5m (USDollars 179.8m) for the six
months to end-December, a 10.6 per cent increase over the same period of
1992-93.
Earnings per share increased by around 12 per cent, to 27.4 cents, on a
fully-diluted basis and also before tax. Sales rose by a tenth, to ADollars
2.73bn. The company incurred only a small ADollars 106,000 abnormal charge
in the most recent half-year, but had the benefit of a ADollars 67.2m
surplus last time. As a result, net profit after abnormals fell from
ADollars 294.7m to ADollars 251.4m.
Amcor said that it saw better operating conditions in Australia, North
America and the UK, with growth continuing in New Zealand and Asia. But
packaging activities in France and Germany continued to face a tough
economic climate, and Europe was the one region to show a fall in pre-tax
profits year-on-year.
On the packaging side, profits before interest and tax were up by 7.5 per
cent to ADollars 171.2m, with sales increasing by 15.4 per cent, to ADollars
1.57bn. On the paper side, which was recently augmented by the purchase of
North Broken Hill Peko's Associated Pulp and Paper Mills, profits dipped
slightly, from ADollars 106.1m to ADollars 104m.
Paper merchanting earnings rose, but the main Amcor Paper Group saw profits
dip by almost 6 per cent, under fierce competition.
Reduced interest charges, down from ADollars 43.6m to ADollars 29m, also
helped the increase in pre-tax profits.
Amcor said that it expects total outlays on acquisitions and capital
expenditure to exceed ADollars 1.1bn in the current financial year. North
Broken Hill Peko announced yesterday that it is spending ADollars 31m to
build a satellite woodchip mill at Hampshire, Tasmania.
