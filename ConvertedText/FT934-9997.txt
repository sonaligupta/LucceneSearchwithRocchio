FT  08 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Pensions as a soft target


   From Mr ROBERT J THOMAS


Sir, Barry Riley ('Pension fund as financier to public sector deficit',
November 3) warns that pension funds may be in line for another fiscal raid
on November 30, partly because protest after the March Budget tax credit
reduction was mild. He says authorities will only respond to pension scheme
members on the march.
Pension scheme members or holders of personal pension plans do not make the
connection between future investment returns and the costs of their pensions
or the benefits they will ultimately receive. Nor does the pensions industry
want to communicate bad news to its customers. It is interesting that
concern about possible further erosion of tax privileges the pensions
industry takes for granted appears to be coming only from investment
managers, who fear a downward rating of the UK equity market. Pensions
schemes should also be warning not only about the immediate impact of new
measures on asset prices but mainly about the longer term consequences of
lower returns. This is because it is they and their members who are
threatened. If the government sees pensions as a soft target, the UK is at
risk of jeopardising the enormous asset of having much better occupational
pension provision that most other European countries.
