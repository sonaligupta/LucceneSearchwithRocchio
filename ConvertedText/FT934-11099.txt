FT  02 NOV 93 / International Company News: Bahamian hotel sold to German
group

   KINGSTON


THE Casino Management Group of Berlin has bought an 81 per cent stake in one
of the largest hotels in the Bahamas from the Carnival Corporation of the US
for Dollars 65m, writes Canute James in Kingston. Carnival Corporation will
maintain a minority interest in the 867-room hotel and casino, which will be
refurbished by the German company to become an up-market destination for
European tourists.
Carnival, which operates Carnival Cruise Lines, began searching for a buyer
for the hotel last year, after it recorded a Dollars 33m loss in 1991. The
company will use Dollars 25m of the sale price to liquidate debts on the
three year-old hotel.
