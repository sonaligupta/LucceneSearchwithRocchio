Ballast Nedam, the Dutch construction group which was sold last year by
British Aerospace, is to be partially floated on the Amsterdam stock
exchange next month in a transaction worth at least Fl 259m (Dollars 136m).
ING Group, which bought the company for Fl 500m in December as part of a
consortium that includes German construction group Hochtief, is to sell 3.7m
convertible cumulative preference shares at a price of between Fl 70 and Fl
75 each.
The shares, worth up to Fl 277.5m at these prices, represent 37 per cent of
Ballast Nedam's share capital of 10m shares, divided between 4.7m cumulative
preference shares and 5.3m ordinary shares.
The shares on offer are all part of ING's large minority holding. Besides
Hochtief, which holds 48 per cent, other shareholders include Ballast
Nedam's pension fund.
The underwriting syndicate, led by ING Bank, may sell an additional 450,000
cumulative preference shares if demand permits.
