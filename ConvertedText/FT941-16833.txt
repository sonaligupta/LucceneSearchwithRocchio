FT  07 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Exceptional leaves Osprey Pounds 5m in red


Osprey Communications, which provides advertising and associated services,
incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 5.07m for the 16 months ended September
after taking account of an exceptional provision of Pounds 4.33m.
During the period the group sold its marketing services division to
management for Pounds 2.1m, bought SMS Communications in cash and shares and
raised Pounds 1.5m via a rights issue.
Mr Jack Rubins, who took over as chairman following SMS's reversal into
Osprey, said the results were dominated by the impact of the first 12 months
during which trading was 'far from satisfactory.'
He said yesterday that since June Osprey had returned an operating profit
each month, borrowings had been substantially reduced and the group had
closed its extended financial period on a 'positive note'.
Turnover for the 16 months totalled Pounds 29.4m and operating losses
amounted to Pounds 282,000. Losses per share emerged at 30.12p. There is no
final dividend, leaving shareholders with just 0.1p for the period.
For the 12 months to May 31 1992 the group incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds
336,000 on turnover of Pounds 25.6m. Losses per share emerged at 2.03p and a
dividend of 0.65p was paid.
The shares closed 2 1/2 p higher at 35p.
