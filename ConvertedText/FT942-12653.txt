FT  28 APR 94 / UK Company News: Low & Bonar chief gets Pounds 178,263


The new man at the head of Low & Bonar received 21 per cent more in pay than
his predecessor for helping the Dundee-based paper and packaging group to
show pre-tax profits almost quadrupled in the year to November 30.
Mr Jim Leng, group chief executive, received a total of Pounds 178,263
compared with Pounds 146,813 for Mr Roland Jarvis. Mr Leng's basic
emoluments were lower at Pounds 137,672, against Pounds 145,733, with a
performance related Pounds 40,691, compared with Pounds 1,080, making up the
difference.
However, Mr Leng was not the company's highest paid director. That honour
went to Mr Jim Heilig, chief executive of Bonar Inc, the North American
offshoot, who joined the board at the beginning of 1993.
He received Pounds 307,089 of which Pounds 59,286 was performance related.
