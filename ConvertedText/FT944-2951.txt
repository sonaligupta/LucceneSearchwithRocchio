FT  15 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Southern Water turns in 9.8% advance to
Pounds 70.8m


   By HAIG SIMONIAN, Environment Correspondent


Southern Water, one of the 10 biggest water groups, confirmed the strong
tone in the industry by reporting a 9.8 per cent increase in interim pre-tax
profits from Pounds 64.5m to Pounds 70.8m.
Sales in the six months to September 30 climbed 10.9 per cent to Pounds
190.6m with the help of a 29 per cent increase in the company's non-water
activities, while turnover on the regulated water side grew by 5.7 per cent
to Pounds 169.5m.
The improvement triggered a 9.7 per cent dividend increase to 8.45p. The
shares gained 31p to close at 570p.
Southern's advance came despite a 40 per cent rise in investment spending to
Pounds 104m. This should decline in the second half to reach a full-year
Pounds 185m. However, capital outflows will remain a heavy drain as Southern
plans to spend Pounds 1.2bn over the next five years to meet new urban waste
water standards.
The rise in interim profits came through a mixture of higher sales, tight
cost controls and limited acquisitions.
Costs on the regulated side remained virtually stable. The main increase in
expenses came in Southern's non-regulated businesses, where it has expanded
into such areas as quantity surveying and environmental services.
Earnings per share rose 7.9 per cent to 39.8p.
COMMENT
Southern Water's no-surprises interim results, backed by this week's strong
performance in the water regulator's league table of service standards,
confirms its image as one of the best-run groups. Heavy capital spending
will continue to overshadow earnings, but the damage may be limited by
cost-cutting and innovations such as new technology to remove pesticides
from waste water much more cheaply. Southern's relatively high K-factor in
Ofwat's review also supplies some headroom. Whether that will be enough to
produce an earnings and dividend surge is unlikely. But Southern's strength
compared with its rivals has been its consistent profits and dividends
growth. A likely 9 to 10 per cent rise in the full-year dividend to about
25p - a prospective yield of about 5.5 per cent - and a similar-sized
increase in profits to between Pounds 135m and Pounds 140m should cement
that reputation.
