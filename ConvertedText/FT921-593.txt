FT  28 MAR 92 / UK Company News: HTV tumbles but expects sharp recovery


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


HTV, the ITV company for Wales and the west of England, suffered a drop in
profits from Pounds 4.94m to Pounds 441,000 pre-tax for the 1991 year.
Some recovery in advertising revenue in the second six months enabled the
company to wipe out a first half loss of Pounds 4.8m.
Extraordinary items of Pounds 8.02m included the cost of applying for a new
licence, closure expenses and a Pounds 4.2m provision which arose from the
disposal of the fine arts division.
HTV noow plans to concentrate on its core television activities.
Mr Louis Sherwood, the chairman, said yesterday that he expected 'a
significant recovery in 1992, due partly to some improvement in net
advertising revenue which has been evident during the early months of this
year.'
HTV had made conservative estimates of growth in advertising in its
application for a new licence - an average real growth of 2.9 per cent a
year over 10 years.
The ITV companies' prospects would also be boosted by savings in overheads
already achieved and the reduction in the Exchequer levy on ITV profits.
HTV won a new 10 year licence beginning in January by narrowly outbidding
three rivals with an annual bid of Pounds 20.5m.
Mr Sherwood insisted yesterday that because of such factors as no longer
having to contribute towards the cost of the Welsh fourth channel and
savings on transmission charges 'the overall effect is scarcely more
expensive.'
Since 1988 the number of people involved in the franchise operation has
fallen from 998 to just over 500.
Mr Charles Romaine, HTV's chief executive, said yesterday that as a result
of the redundancies 'the level of staff matched the level of business and we
are now in the process of building up morale.'
Despite the pressure HTV is proposing to maintain its final dividend at
2.25p making an unchanged 3.75p total.
Turnover at Pounds 171.7m was slightly down on last year's Pounds 178.8m.
Because of the substantial extraordinary charges and provisions, net assets
per share were reduced to 53.05p compared with 73.5p in 1990.
The company was hoping that improved cash generation this year would ensure
a substantial reduction in borrowings currently at around Pounds 20m.
Mr Huw Davies, director of television, was optimistic that the break-up of
'the old producer's cartel' and its replacement with a central network
scheduling system would mean more national programme opportunities for HTV.
The shares closed 2p higher yesterday at 65p.
