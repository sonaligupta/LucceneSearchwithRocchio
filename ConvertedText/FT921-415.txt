FT  30 MAR 92 / Survey of Lloyd's of London in World Insurance (4): It's no
longer such a cosy club - The agencies are undergoing a rigorous shake-up


   By RICHARD LAPPER


FOR MR Eric Dugdale, running his family's members' agency consisted of
lunching two or three times a week with Lloyd's Names at The Savoy - a
pleasant diversion from time spent building up his art collection.
That was over 20 years ago. Now Mr Dugdale's agency is at the core of a
growing business, the Octavian Group, which is one of the most powerful on
the Lloyd's market. Skandia, the giant Swedish insurer, has a significant
minority stake.
Octavian is a combined agency, running both a members' agency - which
handles the affairs of the market's underwriting Names (whose assets provide
the market's capital base) - and a managing agency which administers the
affairs of groups of Names organised into syndicates.
Its transformation epitomises broader changes within Lloyd's as a whole
whose cosy, clubbable atmosphere is gradually disappearing.
Lloyd's agencies are becoming significant businesses in their own right.
After making a series of acquisitions in recent years, Octavian's members'
agency is in 1992 the seventh biggest at Lloyd's, channeling some Pounds
307m of capital provided by Names into syndicates. Its managing agency looks
after the affairs of 10 syndicates which insure marine, aviation, energy,
property, liability and other risks.
The management team which bought out the Dugdale family agency in 1986 has
replaced the old easy going style with a much tougher professional approach.
Mr Nigel Rogers, managing director, says that 'the business principles
operated by all successful commercial enterprises apply equally to Lloyd's
syndicates'.
Mr Rogers, an accountant, says that the managing agency management team  -
whose acronym Fear (financial efficiency and review) symbolises the shift in
mood - monitors the performance of syndicates and provides management
information for underwriters.
Groups such as Octavian are holding increasing sway within the Lloyd's
market as a whole, with hard work, hard skills and professional management
becoming vital for success. Generally, too, bigger agencies and syndicates
are beginning to dominate.
The tough trading conditions - Lloyd's reported its first loss for over 20
years last year - are precipitating the changes. Figures released recently
by the Lloyd's Corporation - which provides back up and regulatory services
to the market - indicate the extent of the rationalisation already under
way.
In the 1992 underwriting year just 278 syndicates will underwrite business
at Lloyd's in 1992 compared with 354 in 1991, 401 in 1990 and 437 in 1980.
There were also 38 syndicates which ceased trading - among them several who
have been devastated by losses arising from spiral reinsurance business in
which syndicates and London market companies insure each other's catastrophe
exposures. Another 38 were merged by managers anxious to generate cost
savings.
Some agency groups have also bitten the dust, continuing a trend throughout
the 1980s in which numbers have fallen, with many smaller family-owned
agencies falling victim to takeover. The number has fallen from 301 in 1981
to 199 last year.
The number of members' agents fell from 137 in 1990 to 111 in 1991, while
the number of managing agents was reduced from 152 to 138. This year, the
trend has continued.
Larger members' agents have forced rationalisation by starving inefficient
syndicates of capital. By making the allocation of Names to syndicates
dependent on the adoption of management changes, members' agents pushed two
managing agents - HG Chester and Secretan - into difficulties.
Chester ceased trading in mid-March. A number of agency groups have taken
the opportunity to expand. Sturge Holdings, Lloyd's biggest managing and
members' agency which manages more than 10 per cent of the market's capital
base and has grown rapidly through a series of acquisitions in recent years,
took control of Secretan Agency last October.
Octavian acquired the Evennett & Partners agency. Castle Underwriting -
whose activities until recently have revolved around the highly successful
syndicate 839, which specialises in financial and liability risks, has
launched an ambitious expansion programme, taking over Devonshire and JH
Davies Agencies. It now manages underwriting capacity in excess of Pounds
200m.
A fourth agency, Hayter Brockbank, has also increased its capacity strongly
but this has been largely by building up its existing syndicates. The
leading 10 managing and members' agents control nearly half the market.
In 1992, the leading 10 managing agency groups will manage about 42 per cent
of the market's capacity, while the leading 10 members' agents will handle
over 46 per cent of the capital supplied by Names. Three combined agencies
manage a fifth of Lloyd's capacity and about 18 per cent of the capital
supplied by Names.
These developments should allow greater efficiency in the market. The task
force identified the fragmentation of the Lloyd's market as one of the
reasons for its high and uncompetitive cost base.
Its report, Lloyd's: A Route Forward, showed that between 1982 and 1990
direct syndicate expenses grew by an average of 19 per cent per year to
reach Pounds 770m in 1990, compared with Pounds 200m in 1982. The task force
estimated that Lloyd's costs overall - which in 1990 also included Pounds
1.37bn paid in brokerage commissions - were a third too high and inhibited
the market's ability to underwrite business profitably.
The task force calculated that a reduction in the number of syndicates at
Lloyd's to 225 could reduce overall expenses from 6.2 per cent to 5.2 per
cent of gross written premiums.
It said Lloyd's costs had risen for several reasons. The introduction of a
more rigorous system of self-regulation after the Lloyd's Act of 1982 led to
improvements in the record-keeping of both syndicates and agents, increased
paper work and a rise in staff employed.
Across the market, agents have made significant investments in computer
technology. Underwriters' salaries - which agents were obliged to publish
for the first time by Lloyd's last year - are too high. More than a third of
the 354 syndicates active in 1991 paid underwriters more than Pounds 100,000
a year in 1987, the first year for which figures have been published. Some
underwriters worked for two or more syndicates earning extra money.
During the boom years of the mid-1980s these problems were obscured by the
growth and the profitability of the Lloyd's market as a whole. Since the
fees paid to agencies by syndicates reflect the amount of premium income a
syndicate receives and its profitability, the income received by agents rose
sharply from 1980.
Since 1988, when the market slid into the red and the total number of Names
began to leave Lloyd's, syndicate managers have become much more conscious
of the need to control and reduce costs, but the change in management
thinking has been slower than necessary, partly because the impact of the
losses has been delayed as a result of the three year accounting system used
at the Lloyd's market. It was unclear, for example, until early last year
that losses would be recorded in 1988.
