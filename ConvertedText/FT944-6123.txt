for Dollars 250m


   By REUTER


Occidental Petroleum, the US oil group, is to acquire Placid Oil for about
Dollars 250m, consisting of Dollars 175m in Occidental preferred stock and
the balance in common stock, reports Reuter.
Placid, the oil and gas operations of the Hunt family, has exploration and
production properties in the US, Canada and the Netherlands.
Occidental said the purchase would add to cash flow immediately, and would
not dilute earnings because of current production.
It said the transaction was expected to be completed by the end of the year.
