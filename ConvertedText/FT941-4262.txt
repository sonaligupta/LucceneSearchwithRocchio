FT  11 MAR 94 / International Company News: Department store side hampers
Coles Myers


   By NIKKI TAIT


Coles Myers, Australia's largest retailer, yesterday announced a rise of
just 3.6 per cent in after-tax profits during the six months to January 23,
and a 2.9 per cent improvement in group sales.
It blamed the weak figures on the nation's lingering unemployment and a
disappointing performance by Myer Grace Bros, its department store division.
Coles profits after tax totalled ADollars 245.1m (USDollars 176.3m) in the
six-month period, compared with ADollars 236.6m in the same 1992-93
half-year. Sales reached ADollars 8.16bn, up from ADollars 7.93bn. Operating
profits, before tax, slipped slightly, from ADollars 367.7m to ADollars
361.8m. Net interest charges were virtually unchanged.
The biggest problems came in the department store division, where operating
profits fell sharply, from ADollars 94.2m to ADollars 63.2m, on static sales
of ADollars 1.81bn. Coles said the division had been forced to clear 'a high
level of overstocked items' via some 'aggressive' markdowns. The group has
already made management changes in this area, and is looking for an
improvement in the second half.
The supermarkets division fared better, pushing up operating results from
ADollars 89.2m to ADollars 101.9m, while the Kmart discount stores advanced
from ADollars 86.7m to ADollars 91.4m.
