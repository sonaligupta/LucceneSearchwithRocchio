FT  29 JAN 92 / Protests to Burma over refugees


   By REUTER


   NEW DELHI


INDIA has strongly protested to neighbouring Burma over the influx of 950
refugees, urging Rangoon to take them back immediately, a foreign ministry
spokesman said yesterday, Reuter reports from New Delhi
The influx of refugees into India's north-eastern Nagaland state follows a
crackdown by Burmese troops on militants of the National Socalist Council of
Nagaland (NSCN).
The NSCN, which has bases in Burma's border areas, opposes New Delhi's rule
in Nagaland state.
The Burmese crackdown on NSCN bases appears to be part of a broad offensive
against a number of rebel groups, including Karen rebels along its border
with Thailand, Moslem guerrillas on the Bangladesh border, and Kachin
insurgents in north-western Burma.
Indian military intelligence sources said some 150 people had been killed
over the past month in heavy fighting between Burmese troops and Naga
separatists in north-western Burma.
Thai officals said yesterday that Burmese troops were advancing on the
headquarters of Karen guerrillias near the Thai border. Recent fighting had
killed 220 combatants on both sides and sent 3,000 refugees fleeing into
Thailand, they said.
