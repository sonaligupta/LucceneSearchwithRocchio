FT  08 NOV 94 / Full Channel tunnel service faces delay


   By CHARLES BATCHELOR


A full Channel tunnel passenger service for drivers and their cars will not
start before the end of November or early December, at least two weeks later
than Eurotunnel's most optimistic forecast.
The company, which operates the Channel tunnel shuttle services, had hoped
to start turn-up-and-go passenger shuttles from November 15 but this early
deadline will not be met, it said yesterday.
Eurotunnel will this week apply to the Franco-British intergovernmental
commission in charge of safety for an operating certificate to run full
commercial passenger services. It will take two to three weeks for the
commission to respond.
Eurotunnel said that there was no single reason for the delay.
