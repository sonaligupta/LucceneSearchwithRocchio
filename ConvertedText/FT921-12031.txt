FT  29 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Hanson


Lord Hanson's remarks to shareholders yesterday showed a mixture of coyness
and naivete scarcely to be expected from a septuagenarian. It appears that
whoever he has chosen as robust enough to succeed him is too delicate to be
exposed to the public eye. It also appears that he is still perplexed by
ICI's refusal to let him help with its business. Lonrho has shown what can
happen to a company if the founder stays too long. One hopes that Hanson is
not going the same way.
