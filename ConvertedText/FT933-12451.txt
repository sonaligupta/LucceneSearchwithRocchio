FT  23 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (America): US equities retreat from
record levels


   By PATRICK HARVERSON

Wall Street
US STOCKS retreated from their record high yesterday after a drop in bond
prices sent equities reeling, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 30.18 down at 3,525.22. The Standard
& Poor's 500 shed 2.67 to 444.51 and the Nasdaq composite receded 4.56 to
695.52. New York SE trading volume was 250m shares.
Although the Dow broke through into record territory on Wednesday, the rise
was neither broad nor particularly convincing. Secondary indices failed to
match the Dow's achievement, and the upward movement was primarily the
result of late program trades rather than sound buying by investors
impressed with the markets' fundamentals.
Consequently, yesterday's early declines were not unexpected. Bad news on
the employment front - jobless claims rose 24,000 in the week ended July 17
 -contributed to the gloomy opening.
Although bond prices rebounded in early trading, a warning from Mr Alan
Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, that because of inflation fears
an interest rate rise was 'somewhere out there' pushed Treasuries lower in
mid-afternoon, triggering a late sell-off in the equities markets.
Otherwise, much of the day's business was dominated by the latest earnings
reports, although investors appeared to take most of the results in their
stride.
AT&T eased Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 63 7/8 in volume of around 1m shares
after the telecommunications group reported a modest increase in
second-quarter net income to 77 cents a share.
Compaq rose Dollars 1 7/8 initially after announcing a jump in
second-quarter earnings to Dollars 1.21 a share, but fell with the market
later to end a net Dollars  3/8 down at Dollars 48 5/8 .
Bankers Trust lost Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 76 in spite of a 35 per cent
rise in second-quarter profits. The stock had been close to its all-time
high prior to the results, and there was some concern over unusual currency
losses in the quarter.
Oil issues were flat, with Amoco up Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 52 3/4 but
Texaco off Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 62: both posted modest improvements in
earnings yesterday. Delta Air Lines firmed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 51 on
news of an impressive earnings recovery. The carrier posted a second-quarter
profit of Dollars 7.1m, after heavy losses a year ago.
On the Nasdaq market, MCI Communications eased Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 28
3/4 in volume of 3.6m shares after reporting second-quarter earnings of 32
cents a share, up from 26 cents in the same quarter of 1992.
After an early rise on news that the Federal Trade Commission voted not to
issue a complaint against Microsoft on allegations that it violated
anti-trust laws, the stock fell to end Dollars 1 3/8 down at Dollars 77 5/8
on fears that the issue is far from over.

SUMMER malaise and weak North American bond markets hammered virtually every
sector on the Toronto Stock Exchange to a lower close. The TSE 300 index
lost 28.9 at 3,838.5 and falls led rises by 406 to 285 after volume of 50.9m
shares. Northern Telecom fell a further CDollars 1 1/2 to CDollars 27 5/8 on
its second-quarter loss.
