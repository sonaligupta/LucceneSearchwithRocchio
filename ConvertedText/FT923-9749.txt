FT  04 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Cautious comments hit BOC


   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE


INDUSTRIAL gases group BOC fell sharply in early trading as analysts made
cautious comments ahead of the nine-months' results, due on Thursday. The
shares were down 14 at one stage before rallying with the market to close 4
off at 593p.
Some of the weakness was prompted by UBS Phillips & Drew, which recently cut
its full-year forecast to Pounds 345m, believed to be at the bottom of the
analysts' range.
Mr Alasdair Nisbet of UBS said he was predicting Pounds 85m for the quarter
and Pounds 248m for the nine months. The figures are below the market
consensus and Mr Nisbet has based his caution on recent figures from BOC
competitor Air Products, problems in BOC's vacuum business and the adverse
effect of a weaker dollar.
Also, BZW reduced its 1993 prediction by Pounds 15m to Pounds 390m and
turned seller, arguing that BOC's anaesthetic gases arm will be hit when its
key product comes off patent early next year.
Vodafone firmer
Telecoms group Vodafone gained 5 to 316p in response to positive
recommendations from several brokers. Most focused on the fact that the
shares have been under pressure for the past two months, with the threat of
increased price competition from rival Cellnet, and now look good value.
Analysts also expect good trading news from this Friday's agm.
Mr Martin Mabbutt at Nomura, moving from a hold to a buy, said: 'While
Vodafone may suffer some loss of revenue from Cellnet's price plan, it is
operating in a long-term growth market and the shares look attractive. We
believe they have a 15 per cent relative upside over the next 12 months.'
Hoare Govett also likes Vodafone, but only on a short-term view, believing
that the threat from Cellnet and the new Personal Communications Network
will adversely affect revenues.
GEC report
The weekend publication of defence group GEC's annual report provided the
spur for the day's trading in the stock. Analysts were particularly cheered
by the increase in the pension surplus revealed in the report, and by
accountancy practices at the company.
Mr Jim Ross at Hoare Govett, who remains positive on the stock, said: 'The
conservative nature of the accountancy report reinforces the group's
defensive attractions.' The shares responded by firming 4 to 225p in brisk
trade of 7.3m shares.
British Gas continued Friday's slide, ending 4 lower at 236p, following the
referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission of access to the gas
transportation and storage system operated by the group.
However, Mr Fergus Macleod of County NatWest said he expected the 8 per cent
yield on the shares 'to provide the backstop fairly soon', and Mr Keith
Morris of Carr Kitcat & Aitken said he was a 'gentle buyer' at these levels.
Weekend press reports that BP might announce restructuring charges of up to
Pounds 1bn when it announces second quarter results on Thursday sent the
stock into an early spin. However, the shares were given a lift from the US
as dealers reported Prudential America as advising clients to switch out of
Mobil and into BP.
The positive US comment helped the stock to rally comfortably to close
unchanged on the day at 212 1/2 p.
Insurers bounced in a thin market, recovering from recent underperformance.
General Accident was the biggest gainer, climbing 19 to 390p.
Insurance analysts said some investors were buying on a view that the group
would hold its dividend when it announces interim results next Tuesday.
Fears about a dividend cut have dogged the shares in recent weeks.
Commercial Union appreciated 13 to 442p and Legal & General 2 to 340p. The
rises were helped by buying to cover short positions.
Tired old suggestions, repeated in the weekend press, that MEPC had been
talking to Hong Kong Land added spice to an otherwise dull properties
sector. The shares advanced 10 to 246p.
Interim results below the range of analysts' forecasts sent Abbey National
down 3 1/2 to 255p.
Stock overhanging the market was said to have held back Laporte. The
specialty chemicals group fell 7 to 514p.
Weekend press comment following last week's reorganisation announcement
helped ICI move forward 9 to 1172p.
Following worries last week over quality and metering, water shares bounced
back. Among the main movers yesterday, North West and Thames both jumped 12
to 414p, Yorkshire 16 to 434p and Anglian 9 to 392p.
More big volume in Grand Metropolitan saw the shares advance 12 to 422p with
6.2m traded as its recent poor run was considered overdone. US investors
were reported to be prominent among the buyers. The shares were also helped
by a push from securities house Smith New Court, which also recommended
Guinness, 9 higher at 544p.
Technical positions helped selected food manufacturers. Short positions in
Cadbury-Schweppes, up 6 at 481p, and Unilever, ahead 14 at 956p, assisted
the shares as marketmakers chased stock. The latter was also helped by
anticipation that good second quarter figures will be reported this Friday.
Reports that a building company belonging to a director of hotel group Savoy
had gone into receivership had a predictable effect on the share price.
Savoy dropped 30 to 500p as market worries over the group's exposure, later
proved unfounded, to the failed builder depressed the stock.
Marketing services group WPP improved 7 to 47p after major shareholder
Fidelity Investments said it would support the advertising group's
restructuring.
Takeover hopes lifted Mirror Group Newspapers a further 5 to 76p. The hopes
were buoyed by Friday's news that Dublin-based Independent Newspapers
Holdings had acquired a 1.3 per cent equity stake.
Hopes of a tank order at Vickers helped the shares firm 4 to 125p. TI Group
shares were wanted ahead of today's interim statement, gaining 5 to 314p.
Turnover in business services group BET rose to 14m shares after two large
trades went through the market. The stock finished a halfpenny firmer at 110
1/2 p.
