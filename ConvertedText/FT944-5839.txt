Bharat Heavy Electricals (BHEL), the partially-privatised company which is
India's leading producer of electricity generation equipment, saw a 46 per
cent rise in net profits during the first half of its financial year, scored
on record sales.
Net profits in the six months to end-September totalled Rs327.5m (Dollars
10.4m) compared with Rs223.3m a year earlier on sales of Rs13.79bn, against
Rs10.89bn. At the gross level, profits were Rs1.06bn, up from Rs911.9m.
BHEL said it had secured orders worth Rs25.90bn for the supply of power
plant equipment, industrial products and services in the six-month period.
The company said it had won some prestigious orders in spite of the
'turbulent market situation', taking its total outstanding orders in excess
of Rs80bn.
The orders include a Rs1.14bn export contract for gas turbines from the
Electricity Corporation of Saudi Arabia, which BHEL won in the face of
competition from European and American multinationals.
The company has also secured a World Bank-funded contract for the supply of
shunt reactors to Nigeria as well as some large domestic orders.
A spokesman said the company had shifted its focus to the non-power sector,
which accounted for 46 per cent of the company's turnover in 1993-94
compared with 27 per cent in 1986-87.
The state-run company had its shares listed on the Bombay stock exchange
after 38 per cent of its equity was sold to employees and select financial
institutions.
Voltas, one of India's leading manufacturers of home appliances and
compressors, and part of the Tata group, the country's largest business
house, announced an increase of 166 per cent in net profits to Rs94.10m in
the six months to September 1994, compared with Rs35.30m for the
corresponding period last year. Net revenues advanced to Rs5.55bn from
Rs4.58bn.
India's Century Textiles, part of the Birla group of companies reported a
net profit of Rs567.8m for the six months to September 1994, an increase of
6.1 per cent over last year's Rs535.37m. Net sales rose to Rs6.45bn from
Rs5.74bn.
