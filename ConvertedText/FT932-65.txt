FT  30 JUN 93 / International Company News: Daewoo Heavy turns to Russia for
technology

DAEWOO Heavy Industries plans to build helicopters using Russian technology,
starting next year.
The Korean company has so far been mainly a producer of aircraft fuselages
and wings and helicopter components, with aerospace sales of USDollars 56m
last year.
Daewoo will co-operate with the Mil Design Bureau to develop transport and
multipurpose helicopters for both domestic and foreign markets.
It will import helicopter production technology from the Kazan Helicopter
Production Association and engines from the Klimov Design Bureau.
The project is the latest example of Korean companies turning to Russia for
the supply of technology in areas ranging from electronics to aerospace.
Russian technology is less expensive than that from the US, and European and
Russian companies have shown greater willingness to transfer technology to
South Korea.
