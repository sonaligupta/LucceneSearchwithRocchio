FT  24 NOV 92 / US growth of 2.5% predicted for 1993: OECD annual survey
indicates underlying rate of inflation likely to fall below 3 per cent


   By MICHAEL PROWSE


   WASHINGTON


THE sluggish US recovery should pick up speed next year but low levels of
savings, investment and productivity growth raise doubts about the
longer-term outlook for living standards, the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development says in its latest annual survey of the US
economy.
It says that US economic growth is likely to rise from 1.8 per cent this
year to just under 2.5 per cent next year, reflecting the delayed impact of
past cuts in interest rates and an easing of private-sector restraints on
growth, such as high corporate and individual debt burdens.
'Inventories are very lean, and so further expenditure increases should be
translated quickly into production. With productivity already back to its
pre-recession trend, increased production is likely to require additional
hiring, which should reassure households and contribute to their willingness
to spend.'
The recovery, however, will be slower than in past business cycles, with the
unemployment rate likely to remain close to 7.5 per cent until the end of
next year.
Given substantial slack in labour and product markets, the underlying rate
of inflation is likely to fall below 3 per cent next year.
The current account deficit will rise, but should not far exceed 1 per cent
of gross domestic product, partly because exports will continue to be
supported by the competitiveness of the dollar against the D-Mark and yen.
The OECD is gloomier about the US's medium-term prospects, pointing to a
'serious erosion of the factors underpining current and future prosperity'.
Living standards as measured by real per capita consumer spending rose at a
1.75 per cent annual rate during the 1980s, against 2.25 per cent during the
1970s.
But even this reduced growth may not be sustainable because it reflected an
increase in labour force participation rates, as women entered the paid
workforce, and reduced provision for the future, as both individuals and
government borrowed heavily. At some point, savings and taxes will have to
rise, temporarily reducing living standards.
Labour productivity, as measured by output per hour, grew at an annual rate
of only 0.8 per cent in the 1980s, a 'deceleration from the already anaemic
1.7 per cent pace of the 1970s'. Real wages either stayed level or fell,
depending on the measures used.
Reasons for the decline in productivity growth are not fully understood but
the OECD believes a decline in savings and investment played a big role.
During the second half of the 1980s, the ratio of net national savings to
GDP fell to 2.5 per cent of GDP, the lowest of any OECD country. This
compares with a 7 per cent rate in the 1970s and an average of 10 per cent
in other industrialised countries. The ratio of net investment to GDP was
also the lowest in the OECD area in this period.
The OECD says the main policy priority is to raise national savings by
reducing the federal budget deficit, which was equivalent to 5.5 per cent of
GDP in fiscal 1992.
The main source of persistent deficits is growth of federal 'entitlement'
programmes, mainly pensions and health care for the elderly, that has far
outstripped growth of tax revenues.
If the US adopts policies 'commonplace in other OECD countries', it can
readily eliminate the deficit by the mid-1990s, the report says. The OECD
recommends spending cuts and tax increases.
Effective controls on health-care costs, including a freeze on federal
spending relative to GDP, could save Dollars 90bn (Pounds 60bn), or more
than 1 per cent of GDP, by 1996. Allowing less tax relief on federal pension
payments could raise a further Dollars 26bn, or 0.4 per of GDP. But the OECD
says general tax increases would be preferable to a squeeze on
non-entitlement programmes, such as food stamps, which were cut in real
terms in the 1980s.
The OECD says a broad-based 5 per cent value added tax could raise about
Dollars 140bn, equivalent to nearly 2 per cent of GDP. That alone would be
sufficient to cut the structural budget deficit by two-thirds. A
25c-a-gallon tax on petrol would raise a further Dollars 23bn.
Other possible revenue measures include a tax on employer-paid health
insurance, which would raise Dollars 40bn, and a tax on the rental value of
owner-occupied housing.
The OECD points out that the total US tax burden, at 32 per cent of GDP, is
the lowest of any OECD country except Turkey. 'Solutions to the US budget
situation are readily found,' it concludes, 'what is required is the will to
implement them.'
