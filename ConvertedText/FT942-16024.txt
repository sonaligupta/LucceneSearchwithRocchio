FT  12 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Property sector favoured


   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON


Property shares moved sharply ahead as a positive assessment on the sector
from Goldman Sachs was underpinned by some bullish industry and weekend
press comment.
The US investment bank put Land Securities on its recommendation list and
the shares led the sector-wide advance, moving ahead 22 to 657p with 3.6m
traded.
Mr Graham Stanley at Goldman believes recent pessimism on the outlook for
property shares has been overdone. 'Areas of the direct market are starting
to look overbought. Share prices currently value property company assets at
an average 8.4 per cent yield compared to an average yield in the direct
market of 7.5 per cent and falling. Selected property stocks appear to offer
good value.'
