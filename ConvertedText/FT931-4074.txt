FT  12 MAR 93 / BTR names new chairman as profits rise


   By ANDREW BOLGER


MR NORMAN IRELAND was named as the next chairman of BTR, on the day that the
UK industrial conglomerate announced that its pre-tax profits had
comfortably broken through the Pounds 1bn barrier. Mr Ireland, 65, who
stepped down as chairman of the paper group Bowater last month, replaces Sir
Owen Green, 68, who will retire in May after 28 years on the board.
Mr Ireland can serve as chairman for a maximum of three years. Mr Ireland,
Sir Owen and Mr John Cahill were the original triumvirate who built BTR into
one of Britain's most successful companies.
BTR's profits grew 18 per cent to Pounds 1.09bn last year on sales which
were 31 per cent higher at Pounds 8.84bn. The figures included a full-year
contribution from Hawker Siddeley, the UK engineering group which BTR took
over for Pounds 1.55bn at the end of 1991.
Ms Kathleen O'Donovan, finance director, said Hawker had contributed about
Pounds 2bn of sales and Pounds 230m of profits before interest. BTR's
trading margin had been maintained at 14.2 per cent, through a combination
of lifting lower margins in the former Hawker operations and improved
performance by existing BTR businesses.
In spite of the success of the Hawker acquisition, Mr Alan Jackson, chief
executive, said the group was not planning a big acquisition in the
immediate future.
In the absence of economic recovery, BTR continued to reduce its cost base.
A total of 8,600 jobs were shed last year, leading to redundancy and
rationalisation costs of Pounds 36m (against Pounds 56m). Group gearing at
December 31 was 69 per cent, compared with 79 per cent at the half-year and
89 per cent a year earlier. This was achieved by strong cashflow, reduced
working capital, and selling peripheral businesses and assets worth Pounds
270m.
Good progress had been made in some European businesses, but the impact of
the deepening German recession on the rest of Europe remained a concern. The
US recovery was gaining momentum, but in Australia the construction and
commercial interiors sectors continued to be difficult.
Earnings per share rose 9 per cent to 34.3p (from 31.5p). A final dividend
of 10.25p (against 9p) makes a total for the year of 18p, an increase of 9
per cent.
