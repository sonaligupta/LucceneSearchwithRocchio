FT  13 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Renewed pressure on Glaxo


   By JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON


Hard hit pharmaceuticals company Glaxo was the principal casualty among
Footsie stocks as US investment bank Salomon Brothers International turned
the screw on the share price and discouraging news continued to overhang the
company.
Salomon's pharmaceuticals analyst Mr Peter Laing has prepared a
comprehensive analysis of the threat to Glaxo's top selling product, Zantac.
'I had thought Glaxo would start to pick up, but I now expect it to drift. I
do not think it is a panic sell but I have moved it, and the sector, to
underperform.' Some dealers, however, suggested that US investors were
merely standing on the sidelines having seen the American Depositary Receipt
holding slide from 27 per cent at its peak to 16.83 per cent as of April 6.
'That company must be wondering when the pain is going to stop. It is on a
1994 yield of 6 per cent and the shares still keep going down,' said a
trader. The shares fell 17 to 581p, a level not seen since last summer, on
heavy turnover of 5.4m.
Persistent bear tales overshadowed the company. There was talk, denied by
Glaxo, that bad news had leaked out of Monday's Novopharm appeal hearing,
and rumour of a price war when SmithKline Beecham's anti-ulcer product comes
off patent in May.
