FT  21 OCT 94 / International Company News: European expansion costs hit US
tissue group


   By RICHARD TOMKINS


   NEW YORK


Shares in Kimberley-Clark, US maker of Kleenex tissues and Huggies nappies,
lost nearly 9 per cent of their value yesterday after the company's
third-quarter figures showed that it was being hard hit by the cost of
European expansion.
Sales revenues rose by 3 per cent to Dollars 1.8bn, but operating profits
fell by 4 per cent to Dollars 182.4m, and the company was only saved from a
decline at the bottom line by gains on a series of business disposals, a big
cut in the effective tax rate, and a surge in contributions from affiliates.
Because of these unusual items, net income rose 28 per cent to Dollars
141.8m, lifting earnings per share from 69 cents to 88 cents.
Kimberley-Clark has been spending heavily to expand the market for its
disposable nappies in Europe.
Yesterday it said operating profits declined because of increased marketing
and start-up costs associated with this push.
The company went on to cite higher fibre costs and increased research and
development costs as a negative factor in the results - the latter largely
related to the development of new or improved products and the expansion of
the European business.
Results in Europe were not only worse than in the comparable period last
year, but had also deteriorated from the second quarter of this year,
Kimberley-Clark said.
In addition, Mr Wayne Sanders, chairman and chief executive, said the
results for consumer bathroom tissue in Europe had suffered from industry
overcapacity, higher fibre costs and weak prices. However, he said the
company had begun to see some improvement in European tissue prices in
recent weeks.
