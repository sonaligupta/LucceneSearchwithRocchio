FT  04 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Telecom proposals hit C & W


   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO, COLIN MILLHAM and STEVE THOMPSON


THE market registered its disappointment with details of the new telecoms
agreement between Hong Kong Telecom and the Hong Kong government by marking
down shares in Cable & Wireless (C & W), which owns a 57.5 per cent stake of
Hong Kong Telecom. Hong Kong is easily the largest revenue earner for C & W.
By the close, C & W was 14 lower at 554p on good turnover of 2.6m shares.
Telecoms specialists said the market was disturbed by the proposed 8 per
cent reduction in international call prices imposed by the government,
although it was pointed out that this was also following a trend in
international telecom markets.
Other details of the agreement were much as expected, said Mr John E.
Clarke, telecoms analyst at Daiwa Securities, the Japanese-owned securities
house. C & W is scheduled to report preliminary figures on June 17.
Reed pleases
Better than forecast 1991-92 results prompted Reed International to rise
against the market on heavy turnover. The publisher announced profits for
the year to March of Pounds 232m against forecasts of Pounds 213m to Pounds
220m.
Analysts said the headline figure was good and even when a Pounds 9m pension
credit and a Pounds 5.5m positive translation (foreign currency) gain was
stripped out, the results were still towards the upper end of expectations.
The market shrugged off a cautious outlook for the coming year from chairman
Mr Peter Davis who said Reed's optimism at its interim results had been
premature so he was reluctant to forecast. SG Warburg which has been a
strong buyer of Reed for some time, on the back of an advertising turnaround
in the US upgraded its forecast for the year to March 1993 by Pounds 9m to
Pounds 267m. However, James Capel is less enthusiastic feeling that, in the
short term, the share price is 'up with events.' The shares were 16 higher
at one stage and closed 6 better at 580p.
The 6.6 per cent improvement in full year profits from Siebe, ahead of
market expectations, helped the shares jump 12 to 739p, making it the best
performing FT-SE stock of the day. A company presentation at Kleinwort
Benson yesterday afternoon was reported to have gone down well. Several
brokers moved to upgrade current and following year profit expectations
after the results.
Shares in submarine and warship builder VSEL soared, adding 37 to 455p, to
make it the best market performance of the day, after the company reported
figures up 17.6 per cent, and expressed confidence that the UK will order a
fourth trident submarine.
Improved traffic figures for May boosted British Airways, and the shares
hardened 3 to 288p.
Favourable sentiment returned to TI Group with reports that UBS Phillips &
Drew had turned positive on the stock. The shares added 12 to 357p, which
boosted the performance of its bid target Dowty Group, 3 up at 176p.
Turnover in USM-listed Menvier Swann rose sharply and the shares added 21 to
430p, after Credit Lyonnais Laing bypassed the company's broker UBS Phillips
& Drew to place 19 per cent of the company's equity.
MEPC, among the UK's second largest property groups, was the biggest faller
among the Footsie constituents, losing 14 to 330p, or just over 4 per cent.
However, turnover in the stock was a very thin 262,000. The fall was
triggered by news that Moody's, the credit agency, had downgraded MEPC's
long term debt, some Pounds 380m-worth, from A-1 to A-2.
Dealers said the shares had run up recently on the back of rather spurious
takeover rumours.
The battle for control of Midland Bank continued to dominate the banking
sector with many speculators convinced that Lloyds Bank will signal its
intention of bidding well in excess of 500p a share for Midland after the
Lloyds board meets tomorrow.
Midland shares responded by moving up 5 more to 457p on heavy turnover of
7.9m, helped by further keen support from mainly US-sourced arbitrageurs.
Lloyds, meanwhile rose 6 to 438p on 2.5m.
The view that a Hongkong Banking victory in the Midland takeover battle
would push Lloyds into launching a bid for another of the big UK banks led
to keen speculative support for Royal Bank of Scotland and TSB, despite the
widespread view of bank analysts that Lloyds would be most unlikely to
undertake such a move.
TSB rose 2 1/2 to 147p on heavy turnover of 10m while Royal Bank eased to
203p on strong turnover of 5.5m shares. NatWest Bank slipped 2 to 365p
despite more profit upgrades.
Shares in Sturge, the Lloyds underwriter, plummeted 59 to 111p, after being
as low as 90p, following the halved interim dividend, the chairman's
forecast that full year profits would be sharply lower and that the
full-year payment would receive similar treatment. JIB Group dropped 5 to
195p and Lowndes Lambert 11 to 309p in sympathy.
New York continued to cast a jaundiced eye over the pharmaceutical sector
following worrying projections from Bristol-Myers Squibb on Tuesday and the
scepticism affected the UK sector. Glaxo failed to benefit from news that
its top-selling drug Zantac had received approval by the US Food and Drug
Administration for a broader use. The shares fell 14 1/2 to 756p. SmithKline
Beecham lost 20 to 904p.
ICI was not helped by news that the EC is to investigate the sale of its
nylon division to Du Pont of the US. The shares fell 11 to 1328p.
Brewers and drinks companies followed the market down, with some big
international companies losing ground on nervous US selling after the Danish
Maastricht vote. Grand Metropolitan, with more US shareholders than the
other international drinks groups, fell 15 to 493p, while Guinness slipped
10 to 598p and Allied-Lyons a similar amount to 649p. Regional brewer
Marston Thompson fared rather better, gaining 9 to 254p on news of a trading
agreement with Bass, down 12 at 611p.
Laura Ashley, slipped a penny to 93p, failing to react to comments made in
New York by Mr Andrew Higginson, the finance director. He said Laura Ashley
should earn Pounds 7m to Pounds 8m profits this year on flat revenues, after
squeezing inefficiencies out of the company. It reported a Pounds 9.1m loss
last year, when making an exceptional restructuring provision.
Woolworths to B&Q holding company Kingfisher gave up 9 to 545p as the
chairman told the group's annual meeting 'as ever, the challenge now is to
keep ahead of the game in a trading environment which as yet has shown no
signs of any substantial recovery.' Boots, with results due today, gained 5
to 490p.
