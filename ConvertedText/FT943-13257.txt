FT  20 JUL 94 / International Company News: Record profit of Dollars 1.52bn
at GE

   NEW YORK


General Electric, the US conglomerate which has been severely embarrassed by
a bond trading scandal at its Kidder, Peabody securities business, yesterday
reported a 14 per cent increase in second quarter earnings to a record
Dollars 1.52bn.
The earnings worked through at 89 cents a share and compared with income of
Dollars 1.33bn, or 78 cents, in the same period last year. Revenues rose 10
per cent from Dollars 14.76bn to Dollars 16.2bn.
The company said nine of its 12 businesses reported improved comparable
operating profits, and eight of them reported double digit increases:
appliances, transportation, motors, power systems, plastics, lighting,
medical and GE Capital Services.
Operating profits were lower at aircraft engines and at NBC, the television
broadcasting network. The dip at NBC was attributed mainly to the lack of
programming as strong as 1993's final episode of the popular comedy series
Cheers.
Earnings at GE Capital rose 12 per cent to Dollars 463m. The company said
excellent performances in the consumer, specialty, insurance and equipment
management segments more than offset the Dollars 29m net loss at Kidder. The
securities firm, the market leader firm in the mortgage-backed securities
business, has been hit by a downturn in the fixed income sector.
In the first quarter Kidder took a Dollars 210m charge to cover what GE says
were phantom profits generated by Mr Joseph Jett, the former head of its
government bond trading desk.
GE said the group's second quarter operating margin was 15.3 per cent,
against 14.2 per cent a year ago.
Mr Jack Welch, chairman, said that 'rapid introduction of new products
coupled with continued expansion into new markets puts GE in an excellent
position to achieve record performance in 1994'.
For the six months, earnings were Dollars 2.59bn, or Dollars 1.52, against
Dollars 2.42bn, or Dollars 1.41 a share, excluding accounting charges and
earnings of discontinued businesses.
