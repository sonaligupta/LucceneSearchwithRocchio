FT  22 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Wilkinson Sword


The decision to put Wilkinson Sword on the market looks like a forced sale.
Gillette is under pressure from competition authorities in the UK and
Germany to dispose of its non-voting stake. In March, the UK government gave
Gillette six months to get out. Several other shareholders - Skandia, Den
Danske and Trygg Hansa among them - could certainly use the cash. Wilkinson
is by no means the only industrial asset bought by Scandinavian financial
institutions in the late 1980s and now up for sale. That said, the company
will be better off with an owner willing to inject fresh capital. The latest
product range has already run into capacity constraints, resulting in a
postponed launch in some markets. Investment in new capacity and heavy
promotional expenditure will be required to claw back market share from
Gillette. This was clearly beyond the means of the existing backers.
So it is no surprise that an asking price of around Dollars 300m, a multiple
of nine times last year's earnings, looks cheap. Even allowing for the need
for capital investment, Wilkinson is a strong international brand in a
recession-resistent sector. Potential buyers might do well, though, to brace
themselves for a struggle to keep up with Gillette which has over 60 per
cent of the UK and German markets.
