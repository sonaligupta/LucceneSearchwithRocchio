FT  11 NOV 92 / International Company News: BIL sells 7.5% stake in Air New
Zealand


BRIERLEY Investments Limited, (BIL) the New Zealand-based hotels and
investment concern, has sold a 7.5 per cent stake of Air New Zealand for
NZDollars 87.2m (Dollars 45.7m), agencies report.
The stake has been sold to New Zealand brokerage Doyle Paterson Brown and UK
brokerage Smith Newcourt, which have in turn sold the shares to 40
institutional shareholders in Asia, the UK and the US, Brierley Investments
said.
The sale reduces Brierley Investments's stake in Air New Zealand to 35 per
cent from 42.5 per cent.
Brierley Investments chief executive Mr Paul Collins said the company
remained committed to the long-term retention of its 35 per cent
shareholding interest in Air New Zealand, acquired in 1989.
However, Mr Collins added that it had always been envisaged that the 7.5 per
cent stake, which Brierley Investments acquired from American Airlines eight
months ago would in due course be sold.
Following the sale, the ownership of Air New Zealand comprises 35 per cent
Brierley Investments, 20 per cent Qantas Airways of Australia, 5 per cent
Japan Air Lines and 40 per cent institutional and private investors.
Air NZ shares were five cents stronger at NZDollars 2.65 in early trading.
The share price has lifted strongly recently. The stock has traded as low as
NZDollars 1.53 this year.
