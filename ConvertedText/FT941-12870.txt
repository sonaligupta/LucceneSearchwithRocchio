FT  28 JAN 94 / SA inflation down

South Africa's yearly inflation fell to 9.7 per cent in 1993, down on the
1992 figure of 13.9 per cent and the lowest since 1973, writes Matthew
Curtin in Johannesburg. Although December month-on-month inflation rose 0.3
percentage points to 9.5 per cent, economists believe inflation could fall
as low as 6 per cent in April. Good summer rains and buoyant business
confidence are expected to assist growth during 1994 after a four-year
recession.
