FT  06 JAN 94 / Observer: Standard of criticism


Strange goings on at the Evening Standard. Yesterday's first edition carried
a stirring feature by Stephen Fay, a well-known financial journalist, on why
it was a tragedy that Paul Newall, the new Lord Mayor of London, had not
picked up the customary knighthood. The City of London PR machine admitted
it could not have written a better piece itself.
Hence some surprise when later editions carried a hurriedly rewritten
feature under the same headline, 'Turn again Mr Major and give this man a
knighthood', by an unknown James Watson. The paper's switchboard had never
heard of him.
The arguments were much the same and the only real difference was the
conclusion. The mysterious Watson, who is understood to moonlight as editor
of London's evening paper, did not support Fay's conclusion that future Lord
Mayors should 'cancel the trumpets, cross the prime minister's name off the
guest list for the next Guildhall dinner, and let Mr Major find a more
humble venue to tell us about the state of the nation'.
Pity. Observer has always felt that it would be far healthier if London's
monopoly on these state of the nation events was broken. Why doesn't John
Major let Glasgow, Manchester and Birmingham have a go at staging the
equivalent of the Mansion House/Guildhall dinners? It would do wonders for
the morale of the regions.
