FT  24 AUG 92 / The London Conference: Bosnian president to unveil peace
plan


   By JUDY DEMPSEY


Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic will unveil to the London conference a
comprehensive peace plan based on ethnic rights and a secular democratic
state, writes Judy Dempsey. The plan, aimed at preventing Bosnia from being
carved up between Serbia and Croatia, or from being divided into ethnically
based cantons, involves reconstituting the government of Bosnia.
Bosnian officials last night said the republic would neither be a unitary
nor an Islamic state. Instead, it would set out to give Moslem, Serb and
Croat ethnic communities far-reaching rights which would be enshrined in the
constitution, and exercised in a second chamber. The ethnic groups
represented in the second chamber would have power of veto.
The officials added that the plan would also entail clawing back some of the
territory seized by Bosnia's Serbs.
