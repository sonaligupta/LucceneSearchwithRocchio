FT  19 APR 94 / International Capital Markets: Record fine for CBoT over
CFTC complaint


   By LAURIE MORSE


   CHICAGO


The Chicago Board of Trade, the world's largest futures exchange, has agreed
to pay a Dollars 300,000 fine and undertake remedial actions to settle a
complaint by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission that the exchange
failed in its supervision of a member firm, Stotler and Company, which
collapsed in August 1990.
The fine is the largest civil penalty the CFTC has imposed on an exchange.
The settlement ends a three-year examination of the exchange's treatment of
Stotler and its records in the period leading to the company's demise.
Mr Karsten Mahlmann, who was CBoT chairman at the time of Stotler's failure,
was also a principal at the firm.
In its 10-count complaint against the exchange filed last May, the CFTC said
the CBoT failed to notify the agency of serious deficiencies in Stotler's
financial records as early as 1987 and failed to enforce its own capital
rules by allowing the firm to remain undercapitalised in 1988.
Although conflicts of interest on the part of Mr Mahlmann were not addressed
in the CFTC complaint, the CBoT as part of its settlement has agreed to
'implement policies and procedures designed to ensure that its staff
maintains an independent mental attitude toward member (firms) when an
officer or director of the firm is also a director of the CBoT.'
