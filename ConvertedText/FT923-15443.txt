FT  02 JUL 92 / International Company News: SGS-Thomson turns in
second-quarter profit


   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO


SGS-THOMSON, the heavily indebted Franco-Italian semiconductor venture
formed in 1987, made a profit in the second quarter of this year.
'We were profitable in the second quarter, even after interest charges, and
we expect to be profitable in the third quarter,' a company spokesman said.
The group also hopes to be able to return to profitability for the whole
year.
The company has returned losses for each year except 1989. It introduced
restructuring measures in 1990, when it made an operating loss and a loss
after tax of about Dollars 100m.
Last year, it reported an increased loss after tax of Dollars 102.6m, due in
part to a hefty interest payment of Dollars 70m, but was able to report a
slight profit at the operating level.
ST, which is owned jointly by Thomson-CSF, the French state-controlled
electronics company, and IRI/Finmeccanica, the Italian state-owned holding
group, is ranked third-largest among European semiconductor manufacturers in
revenue terms by Dataquest, the high-technology consultancy.
The group has, however, shouldered a heavy debt burden which totalled
Dollars 900m last year, and it has been expected that ST would need a
capital injection from the French or Italian government.
