FT  21 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Vickers hint


   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN and JEFFREY BROWN


Vickers advanced 7 1/2 to 170 1/2 p in turnover of 4.8m following buy
recommendations from SG Warburg and Credit Lyonnais Laing and - towards the
close of the session - persistent talk of a possible takeover move from
Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest industrial company.
The engineering sector's other takeover situation, the potential bidding
auction for submarines group VSEL between British Aerospace and GEC,
continued to keep the market guessing. VSEL put on 20 at 1320p while BAe
firmed 2 to 480p. GEC, again affected by heavy volume, shed 2 to 282p in
turnover of 14m.
