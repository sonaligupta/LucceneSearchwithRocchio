FT  23 JUL 93 / Technology: Zinc batteries pack more power - Worth Watching


A New Zealand company, Voltech Agencies of Auckland, is claiming
revolutionary properties for a rechargeable alkaline battery.
The Voltech 555 batteries, which were developed in China, are cheaper than
nickel-cadmium batteries because they are made of less-expensive components
 -zinc and manganese oxide.
They can be fully recharged more than 100 times, say the manufacturers, with
no memory effect. And they can store more power - 1.5 volts rather than the
standard 1.2V. Voltech: New Zealand, 9 379 6985.
