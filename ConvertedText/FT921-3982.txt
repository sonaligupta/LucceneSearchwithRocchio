FT  11 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Japan to bring in financial
reform bills


   By EMIKO TERAZONO

JAPAN'S ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) yesterday approved financial
reform bills ahead of financial liberalisation to be implemented next year.
The changes include an easing of the controversial Article 65 of the
Securities and Exchange Law, the Japanese version of the US Glass Steagall
Act, which separates banking and securities industries.
Following the LDP's endorsement, the bills will be submitted to the current
Diet - parliament - session.
Under liberalised regulations, banks and brokerages, which currently can
only hold up to a 5 per cent stake in a company, will be able to enter each
other's businesses by acquiring more than a 50 per cent stake in a
securities house or banking affiliate.
Banks, however, will not be able to enter the lucrative stockbroking
business, and operations of affiliates will be limited to stock trading and
investment trust management.
Last year's spate of stock scandals has forced the Ministry of Finance to
include rules to limit irregular trading practices in the stock market in
the reform bills. Legislative changes will be made to allow the
establishment of a financial markets watchdog, and the tightening of
penalties imposed on violators of the Securities and Exchange Law.
Other changes include widening the definition of what a securities
instrument is to include, securitised housing loans and leasing mortgages
and commercial paper.
Barriers within the banking industry separating long-term credit banks,
commercial banks and credit unions will also be abolished, increasing
chances for mergers between various financial institutions.
