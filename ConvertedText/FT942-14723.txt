FT  19 APR 94 / UK Company News: Pounds 265,000 settlement for Hillsdown
director


   By MAGGIE URRY


Hillsdown Holdings paid compensation for loss of office of Pounds 265,000 to
Mr Simon Moffat when he resigned as finance director in April last year. The
amount was revealed in the group's annual report, published yesterday.
Mr Moffat had been recruited as finance director only the previous June, but
his appointment had 'not worked out as envisaged by either side', Hillsdown
said at the time.
The report also showed that Mr David Newton, chief executive, received a
total of Pounds 412,000 for 1993, compared with a salary of Pounds 262,000
in 1992 plus a bonus of Pounds 490,000 that year which related to his five
year stint in Canada.
Sir John Nott, chairman since April 30, received Pounds 124,000 during the
year plus pension contributions of Pounds 40,000.
