FT  06 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Richmond chiefs quit to save cash


   By ANDREW BOLGER


Non-executive directors of Richmond Oil & Gas believe the struggling natural
resources company has a viable future, in spite of the resignations of both
its chairman and managing director.
Richmond announced the departure of Mr Robert Fox, the chairman and chief
executive, along with Mr Michael Hogue, managing director, at the same time
as it revealed pre-tax losses for the year to March 31 1993 of Pounds 3.19m,
against Pounds 44.1m, which was struck after provisions of Pounds 38.1m.
Losses per share came out at 3.5p (48p).
Richmond said the results reflected the loss of its main asset, the Richmond
Ranch Properties, to creditors in 1992. This meant the group lost all of its
oil and gas production, reducing turnover from Pounds 11.4m to Pounds 1.64m.
Mr Fox said he and Mr Hogue had stepped down to reduce overheads at the
group, which was short of cash. The board said that in spite of efforts to
reduce costs, the external regulatory and other legal services required were
relatively expensive.
The board is reviewing its plans, including several oil and gas
acquisitions, and said it would inform shareholders about its intentions as
soon as possible.
The plans are subject to the disposal of the San Juan Basin coalbed methane
properties in the US being completed, for which Richmond hopes to receive
about Dollars 5m (Pounds 3.3m).
Shares in Richmond were suspended at 4 1/2 p in October, having come to the
market at 105p in 1989.
Share dealings and transactions relating to the period about the time of the
flotation are under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office.
