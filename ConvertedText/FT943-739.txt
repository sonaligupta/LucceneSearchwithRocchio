FT  28 SEP 94 / US consumer confidence falls for third month

   WASHINGTON


US consumer confidence fell this month for the third month in a row, but the
drop has been slight, and consumers remain optimistic enough about the
future to keep the economy growing at a steady pace.
The Conference Board, a New York-based business group whose monthly survey
is one of the most widely watched gauges of consumer sentiment in the US,
said its confidence index fell to 88.4 in September from 90.4 in August, but
has still only dropped a little over 4 points from its peak in June.
'Most of the decrease is caused by lower consumer expectations for the
immediate months ahead. Still, the current level of consumer confidence has
been associated, in the almost 30 year history of this survey, with a
reasonably lively economy,' said Mr Fabian Linden, who heads the Conference
Board's consumer research centre.
This signal of a slightly steadier pace of economic activity, whose largest
determinant is the strength of consumer demand, came as the Federal
Reserve's policy-setting open markets committee met to discuss whether its
policy of raising interest rates had yet done enough to calm the economy and
head off potential inflationary pressures.
According to the Conference Board, slightly more people said business
conditions were bad in September, and more people said jobs are still hard
to get than those who said jobs are plentiful.
Fewer respondents showed interest in buying a new car or a new home in the
months ahead, but plans for appliance purchases remained about the same.
Although slightly more families said they expected conditions to improve in
the near future, the number who feared the economy would worsen rose
significantly.
On balance, the Conference Board said, optimists continue to outnumber
pessimists, but on the outlook for jobs pessimists still outnumber
optimists.
