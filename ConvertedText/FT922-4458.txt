FT  05 JUN 92 / International Company News: Australian telecom group on
'surest financial footing'


   By KEVIN BROWN

AUSTRALIAN and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation (AOTC), the dominant
participant in Australia's telecommunications duopoly, said it was entering
the competitive environment 'on the surest financial footing'.
AOTC was created in February through a merger of Australia Telecom, the
government-owned domestic carrier, and OTC, the government-owned
international carrier.
Under Australia's competitive telecommunications regime, the group will
compete with Optus Communications, a privately-owned corporation which
acquired the loss-making Aussat satellite company.
AOTC said OTC recorded 8 per cent growth in demand for services in the 10
months up to the merger, when it made a net profit of ADollars 260m
(USDollars 196.9m) on revenue of ADollars 1.4bn.
Telecom Australia made a trading profit of ADollars 1bn over the seven
months before the merger, but reported a loss of ADollars 204m after writing
off ADollars 1.2bn against asset value following a change of accounting
practice.
AOTC said the write-down was largely attributable to depreciation of the
Telecom exchange network. It said the write-down would not affect plans to
spend ADollars 40bn on capital investment over the next five years.
The company said it expected to make further 'comparatively small'
adjustments to asset values in its first financial report, which will cover
the five months from February to the end of June.
