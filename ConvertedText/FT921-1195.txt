FT  25 MAR 92 / Saudis to pay 37% less for petrol


   By MARK NICHOLSON, Middle East Correspondent


SAUDI ARABIA, already one of the world's cheapest places to fill up a car,
has slashed domestic petrol prices by 37 per cent to the equivalent of 8.6
US cents a litre.
The cut is one of several in services and utilities prices made in a
surprise announcement by King Fahd to 'ease the burden of the cost of living
on the citizens'.
The move appears in part designed to soften the effects of inflation in the
kingdom since the Gulf war, which has risen substantially in the past year
in tandem with the general buoyancy of the economy.
The price cuts certainly run counter to the government's general need to
reduce expenditure, given that it is already slated to run an Dollars 8bn
(Pounds 4.6bn) budget deficit for 1992 - its 10th successive budget
shortfall. 'From the purely financial standpoint, it makes little sense,'
said a Riyadh banker.
Registration fees for businessmen and traders will be cut by up to 87 per
cent and cuts will also be made on port tariffs and exit visas.
