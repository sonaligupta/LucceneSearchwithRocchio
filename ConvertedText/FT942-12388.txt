FT  29 APR 94 / International Company News: Delta may axe up to 15,000 jobs
in shake-up

Delta Air Lines, the third-biggest US airline, plans to cut between 12,000
and 15,000 jobs from its workforce of 73,000 in the next three years in an
attempt to restore profitability.
It said the jobs would go as part of a restructuring that would cut Dollars
2bn a year from operating costs by mid-1997 and enable the airline to fight
back against low-cost carriers such as Southwest Airlines.
It described the changes as the most important in its history. Like other US
airlines, Delta has been hit by tough competition and low fares in its
domestic market.
It accompanied yesterday's restructuring announcement with figures showing
it had lost Dollars 77.9m after tax in the quarter to March.
Although this figure was a turnround on the comparable period's Dollars
152.3m net loss, the previous year's figure included an Dollars 82.5m
pre-tax charge relating to a fleet rationalisation, and much of the rest of
the improvement was due to a 10 per cent fall in fuel costs.
Some industry observers suggested that Delta would follow United Airlines'
example by setting up a low-cost, no-frills operation to take on its
short-haul routes, buying employees' co-operation by giving them an equity
stake in the airline.
Instead, Delta has opted for a less radical plan to leave it much the same,
but with a more competitive cost structure. However, Mr Ron Allen, chairman,
warned that if the company met employee resistance to its plans it might
hand over short-haul routes to joint ventures.
Mr Allen said Delta's goal was to reduce costs per available seat mile from
9.26 cents last year to 7.5 cents by 1997. That would be almost on a par
with Southwest's 7.2 cents.
Delta has shed more than 7,400 jobs since June 1992, and last February it
cut employees' pay by 5 per cent. Of its workforce, only the 8,500 pilots
belong to a labour union.
