FT  08 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Growth in exports behind rise at Elliott


   By JAMES WHITTINGTON


Shares in B Elliott yesterday rose 10p to 99p as increasing exports to North
America and east Asia helped the electrical and mechanical engineer lift
interim pre-tax profits by 55 per cent to Pounds 1.94m, against Pounds
1.26m.
Export-driven growth in the specialist engineering and electrical and
electronic systems divisions contributed to an 18 per cent increase in
turnover to Pounds 48.1m (Pounds 40.7m) in the six months to Septem-ber 30.
Earnings per share rose 24 per cent to 4.06p (3.28p). Interim dividends are
restored at 1p, equal to the previous year's total.
Mr Michael Frye, chief executive, said the results demonstrated the
'complete restructuring of the company from a machine tool manufacturer to
greater focus on specialist technology'.
Sales in the specialist engineering and electrical divisions both grew by
about 30 per cent.
On the other hand, sales in the process technology division, which
manufactures machine tools, declined by 11 per cent to Pounds 9.8m (Pounds
11m), owing to low demand in the UK and contractual problems, commented Mr
Frye.
During the period the company made four small acquisitions, worth Pounds 2m
in total, which it has bolted on to existing operations. Mr Frye said the
strong balance sheet allowed for further acquisitions.
Net borrowings stood at Pounds 9.9m at September 30, pushing gearing up
slightly to 83 per cent.
The net cash balance was Pounds 1.8m.
Mr Frye said that with further opportunities for growth overseas and an
improvement in the UK market, the company expected continued organic growth.
