FT  16 NOV 93 / Observer: Man of destiny


Given that the cost of the Channel Tunnel, Britain's biggest-ever private
sector project, has overrun by more than 60 per cent and the opening date
has already been put back twice, Sir Alastair Morton, chairman of
Eurotunnel, may seem an odd choice to head up the new government working
committee on private finance.
Sir Alastair freely admits that if Eurotunnel were to start again in
building the Channel Tunnel he would do it differently. Indeed, he says it
is precisely because he has learnt a lot of lessons of what not to do that
he argues he is so well suited to take on his latest job promoting private
finance in public sector projects. Full marks for honesty.
