FT  23 APR 93 / Global warming 'not addressed'


THE government is not doing enough to address global warming, participants
in a consultation exercise run by the Department of the Environment have
concluded.
Reports from the workshops, attended by businesses, environmentalists and
government officials, showed a desire for a stronger lead from the
government on ways of curbing carbon dioxide emissions and other forms of
air pollution.
