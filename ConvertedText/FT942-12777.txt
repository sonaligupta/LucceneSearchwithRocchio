FT  28 APR 94 / TUC council seats for black workers


Three seats on the ruling general council of the Trades Union Congress are
to be set aside for representatives of black workers.
Mr John Monks, general secretary, said the TUC needed to represent the views
of all its members, but said he was not keen to extend the principle to
other groups such as the disabled or young workers.
The general council also decided to switch the date of the annual conference
after protests from members that it clashed with the start of the school
year in England and Wales. It will now move to the second week of September
from next year for a two-year trial.
