FT  29 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Novo well ahead at Pounds 529,000 but
defers preference dividends


Novo Group, which has interests in radio and electronic capital goods and
was formerly known as EMC Group, returned pre-tax profits of Pounds 529,485
for the six months to end-September.
The results, which follow the acquisition of Novo Com-munications in April
last year, compare with Pounds 122,254 for the same period in 1990 after
stripping out contribu-tions from discontinued activities.
In the 18-month period to March 31 1991 pre-tax profits totalled Pounds
158,342.
First half earnings per share rose to 4.62p (1.17p) and directors said they
expected another satisfactory performance in the second half.
However, to preserve cash flow pending the renegotiation of US banking
facilities, dividends on the preference share capitals are being deferred.
As a result, there is no interim on the ordin-ary capital - 0.3p was paid
before.
