FT  30 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Pounds 0.65m pay-off for Babcock chief


Babcock International paid Pounds 646,000 in compensation to Mr Oliver
Whitehead, who left the engineering group as chief executive in April after
disagreeing with the board over strategy.
Mr Whitehead, who was on a three-year rolling contract, had received a
salary of Pounds 273,174 for the year to March 31, down from Pounds 322,434
because of the impact of a bonus payment in the previous year.
