A much lower provision for depreciation following changes in accounting
procedures has helped the Steel Authority of India, India's biggest producer
of steel, to register a five-fold increase in net profit to Rs3.53bn
(Dollars 112.5m) for the six months to November 30.
Gross profit rose to Rs6.11bn from Rs4.63bn, on sales up to Rs61.19bn from
Rs51bn a year earlier.
Mr MRR Nair, the chairman, said that SAIL had also benefited from 'an
all-round reduction in costs, changes in the product mix and higher sales'.
Interest and finance charges fell to Rs3.53bn from Rs3.83bn.
SAIL and other Indian steel producers have been able to raise prices as
demand has strengthened, but Mr Nair said that much of this additional
revenue had been swallowed up by dearer fuel and freight.
A SAIL spokesman said: 'The richer bottom line is due to the improved
operational efficiency and a higher degree of value addition.'
The company's income rose to Rs61.19bn from Rs51bn.
Tata Chemicals, part of the Bombay-based Tata conglomerate, India's largest
business house, yesterday announced an increase of 18.5 per cent in net
profits to Rs1.04bn for the half-year to end-September, writes Shiraz Sidhva
in New Delhi.
The company, which is the country's largest producer of soda ash and
manufactures cement, detergents and fertilisers, reported a rise in net
sales to Rs2.63bn from Rs2.35bn in the corresponding period last year.
Gross profits increased to Rs1.15bn from Rs1bn last year. Interest and
depreciation fell to Rs261.3m from Rs288m, and to Rs105.6m from Rs117.8m
respectively. There was no tax liability.
