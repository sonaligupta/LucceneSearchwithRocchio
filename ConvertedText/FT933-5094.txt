FT  06 SEP 93 / Inflation down but strong in Greece

GREECE'S year-on-year inflation rate dropped to 14.6 per cent last month,
from 15.7 per cent in July, raising hopes that the government's target of 12
per cent by December can be achieved.
Although the inflation rate has gradually declined from a peak of 16.4 per
cent in March, it is still more than four times the European Community
average.
Progress in reducing inflation has been slower than expected, partly because
of the effects of price liberalisation in the services sector.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development points out, in a
new report on the Greek economy, that 'inflation expectations remain
strong', despite a marked decline in both the public sector borrowing
requirement and the current account deficit.
The report said exchange rate policy should be reformed by announcing in
advance the depreciation rate of the drachma against other European
currencies, so as to 'reinforce confidence in the government's
anti-inflation posture.'
The report forecast that Greece's gross national product would grow by about
1 per cent this year, down from 1.25 per cent in 1992 but ahead of the
European average.
However, it warned that the government could not afford to relax its
stabilisation policy before an election due by next spring.
Revenues for the first eight months of 1993 fell well short of the budget
target, despite the Finance Ministry's efforts to curb tax evasion and speed
collection of tax arrears.
According to the national accounting office, revenues rose by 13.4 per cent
against a budget forecast of 26.4 per cent.
