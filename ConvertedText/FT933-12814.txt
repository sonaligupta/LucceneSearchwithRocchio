FT  22 JUL 93 / Observer: CIB tells the others


Even aficionados of the Personal columns of the Daily Telegraph could be
excused a degree of puzzlement at the abbreviation CIB which appeared
against four of yesterday's 11 entries.
Alongside expressions of deep gratitude to St Jude for lending a hand 'once
again' in some undisclosed enterprise, as well as the daily reading courtesy
of the Bible Society, were a selection of messages targeted at Westminster's
Eurosceptics and anyone else whose eyesight was up to it. 'Speak for us,
don't flinch, kill treaty', 'Unelected Euro-bureaucracy abhored', and other
such subtle morale boosters.
The Campaign for an Independent Britain's honorary secretary, Sir Robin
Williams, agrees that it is 'not our normal way of promoting ourselves'.
But, lacking a comfortable supply of central funds, the 2,300 plus
membership is 'encouraged to shoot off ammunition at any target they can
think of'.
Denied a referendum on Maastricht, some members apparently felt strongly
enough to finance personally their three-line entries.
Not previously alerted to the fruits of his branches' labour, Sir Robin's
response, when told that the entries were flanked by an appeal from a jilted
lover, was heartfelt.
'It really is forlorn that sort of advertisement, don't you think?'
