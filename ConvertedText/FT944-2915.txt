FT  15 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Expansion for Fairey with Pounds 37m US buy


   By PETER PEARSE


Fairey Group, the industrial electronics and specialist engineering concern,
is further expanding its electronics side with the acquisition of Randomat
of the US for Pounds 37m.
Mr John Poulter, chief executive, said that since 1991 the group had spent
Pounds 52.2m on six businesses in the field of on-line measuring and
electronic controls. Randomat's sole operating subsidiary is Microscan
Systems, based in Renton, Washington. It makes high-performance fixed-mount
bar code scanning and decoding devices.
Mr Poulter said Microscan would stand alone from the group - although there
were similarities between the company and other Fairey companies which would
give 'advantages rather than synergies'. There would be no rationalisation
and Microscan is expected to be earnings-enhancing in 1995.
Mr Poulter said Fairey would encourage Microscan to develop its markets,
particularly overseas. Currently between 75 and 80 per cent of its sales are
in the US.
An initial payment of about Pounds 31.5m, comprising Pounds 29.8m and
Dollars 2.7m (Pounds 1.64m) will be made at completion. Subsequently, loan
notes for Dollars 8.5m will be payable in 1995 and 1996 to Mr Mike Mertel,
Microscan's founder, president and minority vendor.
About Pounds 18.5m of the Pounds 31.5m will be raised from a placing of 5m
new ordinary shares at 374p. The balance will come from existing cash
resources and facilities, which will leave the group with cash in double
digits at the December year-end.
Mr Poulter said that while supermarket barcode scanners needed  1/4 to 1/2 a
second to 'read' information, Microscan's products could do 400 to 500 scans
a second.
