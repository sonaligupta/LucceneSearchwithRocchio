FT  30 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Kembrey falls 68% to Pounds 170,000


Against a background of numerous board changes and rationalisation of its
operations, pre-tax profits of Kembrey, the electrical precision components
and foundry products group, showed a 68 per cent decline in the six months
to September 28.
Although turnover increased by Pounds 5.58m to Pounds 15.1m, the pre-tax
line fell from Pounds 530,000 to Pounds 170,000.
The principal reasons for the decline were Pounds 122,000 of trading losses
of the discontinued business of Ripault-Drivex and Pounds 172,000 of
exceptional losses due to reorganisation and adjustment for prior periods
related to the discontinued Coated Electrodes' business.
These losses were further exacerbated by an interest turnround to charges of
Pounds 271,000 (Pounds 35,000 credit) relating to the acquisition in 1990 of
McMurdo, a manufacturer of connectors and marine safety lights.
Earnings per share fell to 0.4p (1.2p) and again there is no interim
dividend.
