FT  30 JAN 92 / The Barlow Clowes Trial: Judge gives ruling on investment
contracts


   By JOHN MASON


THE CONTRACT between the Barlow Clowes investment company and its clients
did not permit an alternative investment policy to keeping funds in
government stocks, the trial judge told the Old Bailey jury yesterday.
Mr Justice Phillips, beginning his summing-up, ruled that the contract
between the company and investors only authorised placing funds on deposit
elsewhere while waiting for the right moment to buy or reinvest in gilts.
The jury might conclude that the company was in breach of this contract, but
it did not follow that a criminal offence had been committed. The central
question was whether the defendants had acted dishonestly, he said.
Mr Peter Clowes, Mr Guy Cramer, Mr Peter Naylor and Mr Christopher Newman
are accused of stealing Pounds 16.9m from investors in offshore funds.
Mr Clowes, Mr Naylor and Mr Cramer are also jointly charged with conspiring
to contravene section 13(1) of the Prevention of Fraud (Investments) Act,
which deals with false statements made to induce people to invest. Mr Clowes
alone is accused of eight offences under the subsection. They deny all the
charges.
The judge also warned the jury not to convict because of the defendants'
luxurious lifestyles. The 1980s was a time when some people grew very rich,
in most cases perfectly honestly, he said.
The trial continues today.
