FT  28 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Tories facing a pasting - Ballot Box


Conservative Central Office seems remarkably relaxed about the fact that it
is losing the window-poster war.
The Tories have plastered billboards across the country with paid
advertisements in the largest campaign of its type ever launched. But across
the country's window-panes from marginal Tooting to Birmingham Yardley - a
Liberal Democrat target - they appear to be trailing.
The Tory line is that their supporters are modest souls who are 'not big
poster displayers'. According to an official: 'They are the silent majority,
but they will turn out on polling day.' In the next breath he adds that it
was 'always my policy in a general election to put up posters in the final
week of the campaign.' The reason for this is what he calls 'the boredom
factor'.
So far it is rare to find a street in which more than one in 10 of the
houses has a poster. In Islington South, however, there is a touch of
nostalgia. A window poster has gone up saying 'Vote Alliance', the grouping
which disappeared after the 1987 election.
