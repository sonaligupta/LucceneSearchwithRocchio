FT  28 SEP 94 / Business and the Environment: On the trail of a sponsor


   By IAN RODGER


Eco-sponsorship, the increasingly popular form of promotion, has hit the
hiking trails of Switzerland.
The Swiss League for the Protection of Nature* was looking for financing to
restore a spectacular trail in a nature reserve high in the Bernese
Oberland, when Timberland, the US hiking shoe company, agreed to put up
funding for the project.
Timberland had heard about it through Alp Action, a Geneva-based
organisation set up by Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan four years ago to mobilise
funds for preservation projects in the Alps. The company will spend Dollars
120,000 (Pounds 76,000) for the initial restoration plus an ongoing
commitment to maintenance.
In return, the path, which rises more than 1,000m from Stechelberg at the
head of the Lauterbrunnen valley to Oberhorn just beneath the tumbling
Breithorn glacier, has been named the Timberland Trail. The company's name
or logo appears on explanatory billboards and signposts all along the 7km
route.
Louis Ferran, Timberland's international vice-president, says the company's
investment was not simply aimed at selling more outdoor shoes and clothing.
'Certainly, our products make no sense if the environment is not maintained.
But many companies use the environment in their marketing.'
Timberland has a policy of trying to involve other people in its activities.
It has participated in City Year, a youth service corps in the US, and it
provides its employees with time off for community service projects. But it
had done little in Europe, where sales have been growing rapidly. This year,
it expects Dollars 140m of its Dollars 700m sales to come from Europe. In
the SLPN, it found a partner with 100,000 members involved in preserving the
environment.
