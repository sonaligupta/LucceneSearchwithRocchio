FT  27 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Performance falls as executive pay
rises


   From Mr J DENNIS HENRY


Sir, Your story, 'Executive pay rises three times faster than inflation'
(January 24), makes many important points but it fails to identify the most
significant feature. Based on a sample from the latest accounts - to the
year ending October 31 1993 - of 653 plc companies in the FT-SE
'non-financials', the remuneration of the highest-paid directors rose by
10.48 per cent on a year-on-year basis.
Breaking this down into the size ranges you used shows that the highest-paid
directors in the 169 companies with sales exceeding Pounds 600m received
increased remuneration of 12.38 per cent. Those directors in the 250
companies with sales between Pounds 100m and Pounds 600m received 9.35 per
cent and the 234 with sales less than Pounds 100m had increases of 7.76 per
cent.
Total board remuneration rose by a more modest 3.48 per cent, according to
the published accounts, while the number of directors rose by 3.67 per cent,
suggesting others did not do quite so well.
A study such as the one the FT reported depends on the co-operation of
participating companies. This raises the possibility of a study having to
omit some companies which did not wish to take part and so avoiding the
disclosure of their increases. The above figures are based on a total sample
of the FT-SE 'non-financials', plus a few more, and therefore provides a
robust appraisal.
What is even more concerning is that while these average increases were
being paid to the highest paid directors, the overall corporate performance
was actually falling. The return on total assets fell from 18.78 per cent to
15.52 per cent (-17.4 per cent), return on capital employed fell from 7.78
per cent to 6.44 per cent (-17.2 per cent), margins declined from 8.04 per
cent to 6.64 per cent (-17.4 per cent) and added value/pay went from 1.71 to
1.69 (-1.2 per cent). Earnings fell 3.50 per cent but retained profit fell
by 47 per cent to only 22.55 per cent of the figure four years earlier.
Noticeably, dividends are up 23.7 per cent over the same four years.
Not only are executives receiving increases larger than inflation, as your
feature stated, but the most senior executives are doing virtually twice as
well as the average you showed. Surely this suggests that the supposedly
independent compensation committees need more rigorous attention to detail
when setting standards and reviewing performance. Otherwise, how can such
overall increases be awarded at the same time as performance is falling?
