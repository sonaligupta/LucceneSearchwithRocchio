FT  30 NOV 94 / International Company News: Volvo Aero joins BMW Rolls-Royce
in engine project


   By REUTER


Swedish automotive group AB Volvo said its aero-engines unit Volvo Aero
would participate in a new jet engine project by Germany's BMW Rolls-Royce
for the BR715 engine intended for use in passenger aircraft, Reuter reports.
'The project is reckoned to give Volvo Aero sales of about SKr1bn (Dollars
133m) at the same time as 100 new jobs are created. If the engine is
successful, sales might be twice that volume,' the Swedish company said.
It did not specify the time period over which it calculated the sales. Volvo
will make one component, the intermediate compressor case, for the BR715.
The BR715 is Volvo's first engine project since the 1980s, although between
the late 1970s and 1989 the company was involved in eight civilian engine
programmes.
