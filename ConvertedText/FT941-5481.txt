FT  05 MAR 94 / Estonia pullout pledge


   By JOHN LLOYD


Moscow yesterday confirmed its intention to pull out troops from Estonia by
the agreed date of August 31 - but only if a dispute over the fate of 10,000
Russian military veterans were settled to its satisfaction, writes John
Lloyd.
On Wednesday Russia had said it did not intend to stand by its promise to
pull out the 2,600 troops.
Estonia has so far been determined not to pay social security to the army
pensioners. It claims most of them are not - as Moscow says - elderly, but
are young/middle-aged ex-counterintelligence or airborne troops who pose a
security threat to the state.
Sweden and Denmark have come out strongly in support of a pullout by August
31. Denmark's Foreign Ministry said yesterday that it planned to raise the
issue with its European Union partners in talks next week.
