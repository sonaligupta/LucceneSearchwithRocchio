FT  29 JAN 92 / Observer: Italian job


Enzo Berlanda, the new head of Italy's stock market and companies watchdog,
Consob, may be the breath of fresh air the country's financial markets have
been waiting for. While chairman of the senate's finance committee,
Berlanda, 65, played a central role in pushing forward long-awaited
legislation to modernise Italy's financial markets and improve their
'cowboy' image.
His appointment was warmly greeted by the trade - not always the case when
an ex-politician parachutes into a top job in Italy. Milanese brokers
praised his professionalism and honesty in particular.
But with trouble brewing with Brussels over aspects of the stock market
reform and long overdue legislation to protect minority shareholders still
stuck in parliament, Berlanda may need all his political skills in his new
job.
The European Commission has already started to take action over the law on
Sims, Italy's new breed of broking-cum-fund management institution - on the
grounds that it violates the Treaty of Rome by obliging foreign houses to
set up shop in Italy. And with the Rome parliament about to be dissolved,
Berlanda will have his work cut out trying to get the new rules on minority
shareholders' rights in takeover bids passed before the polls.
