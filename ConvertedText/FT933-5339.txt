FT  03 SEP 93 / International Company News: Western Mining trims dividend


   By BRUCE JACQUES


WESTERN Mining, the Australian commodities producer, reports a modest
earnings lift for the year ended June but is cutting its dividend from 11 to
10 cents a share.
Equity accounted net profit improved 3 per cent to ADollars 165.9m
(USDollars 110.6m), helped by improved contributions from aluminium, copper
and uranium. The result, on a 2 per cent sales fall to ADollars 1.61bn,
stemmed mostly from continued strong results at the company's integrated
aluminium associate, Alcoa of Australia.
