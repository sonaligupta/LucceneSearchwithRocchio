FT  15 JUN 93 / World Trade News: E Germans back new business site


   By JUDY DEMPSEY


   BERLIN


THE east German state of Brandenburg has given full planning permission for
a Canadian-based company to develop a business site for foreign investors,
in a move likely to attract up to DM500m (Pounds 203m) of investment and
several thousand jobs over the next four years, Judy Dempsey writes from
Berlin.
The Horsham Corporation, which holds a controlling interest in American
Barrick Resources Corporation, the international gold producer, bought the
220-hectare Brandenburg Park, south of Berlin, in June 1991 from the
Treuhand privatisation agency.
It paid DM30m for the land and intends to invest DM60m on infrastructure and
construction over the next 14 months.
