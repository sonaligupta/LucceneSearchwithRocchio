FT  06 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Capital House Investment Management


CAPITAL House Investment Management, a division of the Royal Bank of
Scotland, this week acquired Brown Shipley Unit Trust Managers, with some
Pounds 70m of assets. Some trust rationalisation may follow the change.
Two Brown Shipley trusts are moving to Rathbone Brothers, rather than to
Capital House. The Smaller Companies and Recovery funds, run by Patrick
Evershed, will be rebranded as the Evermore funds. The Brown Shipley
Recovery fund is top of the UK equity growth sector over one year, although
it is next to bottom over five years (Evershed took over management of the
fund only in 1991).
The new funds are reducing the initial charge from 6 per cent to 2 per cent
with immediate effect; the annual charge is 1.5 per cent.
