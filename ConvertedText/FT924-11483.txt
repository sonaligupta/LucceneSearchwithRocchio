FT  26 OCT 92 / Commons to review power sell-off


   By DAVID OWEN


A SECOND influential Com-mons select committee is to scrutinise aspects of
the power generating industry in England and Wales while the government is
conducting its review of coal mining and Britain's long-term energy
requirements.
The Public Accounts Committee will next month start to examine the
privatisation of the electricity generators PowerGen and National Power.
Sir Peter Gregson, permanent secretary at the Department of Trade and
Industry, will be among witnesses called by the committee, which is chaired
by Mr Robert Sheldon, the former Labour Treasury minister.
Although the principal focus of the committee's inquiries will be to assess
whether the government succeeded in maximising its proceeds from the sale,
the industry's future competitiveness in the light of the growing practice
among electricity distributors of building their own gas-fired power
stations is also expected to be scruti-nised.
Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity industry regulator, is
meanwhile bringing forward his review of the way electricity distribution
companies buy their power supplies.
The Public Accounts Committee inquiry follows a favourable report on the
sale of the generators by the National Audit Office, the public-spending
watchdog, earlier this year.
