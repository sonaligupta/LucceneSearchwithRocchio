FT  29 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Saudis order three carriers

VELA International Marine, a subsidiary of Saudi Aramco, the state-run oil
company, has ordered three very large crude carriers of over 300,000 dwt
each with the A P Moller shipping and industrial group's Odense Steel
Shipyard at Lindoe, Denmark, Hilary Barnes reports from Copenhagen.
The order, understood to be worth about DKr3bn (Pounds 270m), was
facilitated by the Danish government, which has prolonged shipbuilding
subsidies, due to be phased out in 1994, for an extra year.
Vela has ordered single-hull vessels, with an option to change the order to
double-hull later. The Lindoe yard, regarded as one of the most efficient in
Europe, is completing an order for seven double-hulled tankers of 286,000
dwt each for A P Moller itself.
