SOUTH KOREA needs to dismantle trade barriers further if it is to reach its
goal of closer political co-operation with the EC, according to a European
Commission document released yesterday.
The Commission pays tribute to Seoul's efforts to open its market, but sets
out a lengthy 'wish-list' covering products and non-tariff barriers
currently under negotiation.
Patents and intellectual property rights. The Commission wants a 1991 accord
updated to include pharmaceuticals and agro-chemicals. Progress on
eliminating counterfeiting and trade piracy is 'encouraging.'
Consumer products. Despite steep reductions in customs duties, outstanding
tariffs remain on imported alcohol. The EC is worried about Seoul's
restrictions on EC-sourced cars.
Telecommunications. The Commission wants new Korean laws reviewed to make
sure they do not discriminate against EC telecoms suppliers.
Financial services. The EC wants its banks to be allowed to open affiliates
and an open market for non-life assurance.
Foreign investment. Korean rules are too complex, and too restrictive.
Foreign companies in Korea also face restrictions on bringing in capital
from abroad.
The Commission report notes that bilateral trade has quadrupled between 1982
and 1991 to almost Dollars 15bn (Pounds 9.7bn). Korea enjoyed a slight trade
surplus of Ecu800m (Pounds 622.4m), but EC exports dropped 12 per cent in
1992 because of the slowdown in South Korea.
