FT  22 JUL 93 / International Company News: Saab sees a return to profit
next year

SAAB Automobile, launching its all-important 900 model, said yesterday it
saw the possibility of a return to profit next year for the first time since
General Motors of the US bought a half-share in the company in 1989.
Mr Keith Butler-Wheelhouse, the Briton brought in by GM last year to head
Sweden's traditional rival to Volvo, declined to make a firm forecast,
warning that the gloomy outlook in world car markets, especially in Europe,
where sales have slumped 17 per cent this year, continued to cloud Saab's
prospects.
But, he added, 'I prefer to say that we have brought down the break-even
point for the company to about 80,000 units sold per year and we intend to
sell significantly more than that next year. So if nothing else changes we
should be in the black next year.'
Mr Butler-Wheelhouse acknowledged that the success of the new 900, which
will compete against the Mercedes C class, the BMW 3-series and the Audi 80,
was vital for Saab, which in the past four years has accumulated losses of
more than SKr10bn (Dollars 1.25bn) and swallowed a further SKr8bn in two
capital injections by GM and its Swedish co-owner, Saab-Scania.
He insisted that Saab was not in a 'do or die' position. He said even if
sales did not hit the high levels Saab hoped for, the company had the funds
and the support of GM and Saab-Scania to continue to develop its next new
model, an upgrade of the luxury 9000 car, due within five years.
The chief worry for Saab is the steep decline in its main markets. It sold
only 35,800 cars in first half of the year, compared with 86,800 in all of
1992 and 109,500 in 1989. Sales in the US - its biggest market - and Europe
were down nearly 30 per cent.
