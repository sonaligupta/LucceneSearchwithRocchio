FT  17 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Smith defends flexible Budgets


   By ALISON SMITH


WISE CHANCELLORS left themselves flexibility for Budgets, Mr John Smith,
shadow chancellor, insisted yesterday as he brushed aside renewed Tory
claims that Labour's tax plans did not add up.
The Tories' focus on the difficulties of phasing the removal of the ceiling
on National Insurance contributions while retaining immediate spending
commitments seemed, however, to disregard some Labour tax options which have
themselves featured in Tory attacks.
In previous discussions of Labour's tax plans, the introduction of a 50 per
cent top tax rate for those on 'well over Pounds 30,000' and removal of the
ceiling on National Insurance contributions have been linked with the two
firm spending pledges on pensions and child benefit. Labour itself, however,
has never been committed to that direct link.
How much would a Labour chancellor have to raise by tax changes? On the
minimalist approach, the party is firmly committed only to raising the
retirement pension by Pounds 5 a week for a single pensioner, and by Pounds
8 a week for a couple; and to increase child benefit - from April, were
Labour then in power - to Pounds 9.95 a week.
Both the government and the Opposition estimate that these would cost about
Pounds 3.5bn.
Beyond this, Labour says that extra spending in areas such as health and
education will be funded from growth.
How could a Labour chancellor raise the money to meet the Pounds 3.5bn
welfare commitments? The Opposition Treasury team says it cannot be definite
about its plans, not least because Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, has not
said what he will do in the Budget.
It stresses, for example, that a Pounds 600m cut in the public sector
borrowing requirement because of the delay in the start of Taurus, the Stock
Exchange's paperless trading, might remain to assist them, just as Pounds
400m of the Pounds 1bn gained helped Mr Lamont temporarily raise the
threshold for house-purchase stamp duty.
As for Labour's own plans, the government estimates that just over Pounds
2.6bn would be raised in the first year from abolishing the National
Insurance ceiling. But raising the ceiling to Pounds 30,000, which might be
one way of phasing in the change, would still yield about Pounds 575m in
1992-93.
Introducing a tax band of 45 per cent on taxable income between Pounds
30,200 and Pounds 36,700, and a top rate of 50 per cent on a taxable income
above Pounds 36,700, would yield about Pounds 2bn in a full year at 1991-92
income levels, according to the Treasury.
Limiting all tax allowances and reliefs to the basic rate would yield about
Pounds 2.2bn at 1991-92 levels of income. If the basic personal allowance
were exempted from this, the yield would be about Pounds 900m.
Bringing in a 9 per cent tax on investment income over Pounds 3,000 for
non-pensioners is estimated by the Treasury to produce Pounds 870m in a full
year on 1991-92 income levels.
Labour itself believes that its commitment to freezing the married couples'
allowance and abolishing tax relief on private medical insurance would yield
about Pounds 170m and Pounds 60m respectively.
Mr Smith protests not unreasonably, that Labour has been clearer about its
tax plans than ministers have been about the Budget. But his options in
phasing any of these tax plans would still produce a wide field for
speculation in the weeks before a first Smith Budget.
