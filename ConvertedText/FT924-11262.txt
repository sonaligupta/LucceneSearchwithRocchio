FT  27 OCT 92 / DTI effort wins more EC funds for software


   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO


THE number of UK projects that have won funding from the European Community
increased strongly this year after a Department of Trade and Industry
initiative on R&D in computer integrated software, Michiyo Nakamoto writes.
The success of projects involving UK groups in winning EC funding highlights
the significant difference government backing can make in the growth of an
industry.
Out of 235 proposals that were submitted to the EC's European Strategic
Programme for Research and Development in Information Technology (Esprit)
III programme on computer integrated manufacture and engineering (Cime), 14
projects led by UK organisations and 33 projects involving UK participants
were awarded funds by the programme. The total amount of funds awarded to
all UK participants was Ecu20m, or about 12 per cent of the total Ecu157.5m
available.
That represents a large increase over the five UK-led projects and 21
projects involving the UK that won funds from Esprit II in 1990.
The UK's greater success in winning Esprit funds came after the DTI
appointed PA Consulting Group to improve the number of successful
submissions from the UK to the Cime section of Esprit.
The UK has a lot of expertise in Cime but has not actively sought EC
funding, said Dr David Howard at PA Consulting. 'The DTI recognised this and
recognised the importance of Cime to UK industry.'
