FT  27 JAN 94 / FT Exporter (27): Now for a world trade body - Dr Gunther
Rexrodt, German minister of economics, says the world trade body agreed on
by the Gatt negotiators must now be given real meaning and purpose / Guest
column / Dr Gunther Rexrodt


   By Dr GUNTHER REXRODT


The successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round negotiations marks another
big step on the road to trade liberalisation and a considerable
strengthening of the multilateral trading system, thanks particularly to the
agreement to establish a new World Trade Organisation (WTO).
Attention now focuses on other issues of importance for trade policy that
have not yet been dealt with fully but that nevertheless require
consideration.
Some results of the Uruguay Round were disappointing. For example, the
framework agreement on trade in services was undeniably a negotiating
success. But if we look at the tertiary sector's extraordinary growth
potential, the overall negotiating results for initial commitments on
financial services, audiovisuals, basic telecommunications, and maritime
transport were disappointing. For civil aircraft and steel, the multilateral
agreement sought by negotiators was not attained.
These issues not resolved, either partly or fully, by the negotiations will
now have to be conducted under the new WTO. Meanwhile, meaning and purpose
must be instilled into the WTO.
On the internal front, the main priority is to work out an integrated
dispute settlement procedure; on the external front, the main effort must be
to intensify relations with other international institutions such as the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
Because of the heavy agenda that already faced negotiators, the inclusion of
additional questions of relevance to trade would have overburdened the
Uruguay Round. One of the most important of these topics is the
trade-environment interface. International trade and trade policy are
interrelated to the environment and environmental protection policy in a
number of areas.
Environmental protection policies can distort trade and, conversely,
commerce can affect the quality of our natural surroundings. Furthermore,
many of a given region's environmental problems can no longer be addressed
without regard to similar problems in other regions. Air and water
pollution, noise, waste, the endangering of rare animal and plant species,
and the destruction of the ozone layer are ecological problems whose impact
transcends national boundaries and are most likely to have global
significance. On the other hand, there is also the danger of environmental
protection measures being abused in order to protect trade.
Scant progress has been made to harmonise measures within worldwide
environmental protection agreements. International organisations such as the
OECD, Gatt, and Unctad, however, are in the process of analysing interface
problems, although they have yet to arrive at common results or conclusions.
In the absence of binding common rules, the Gatt procedure for settling
disputes in this area is in its infancy. With its official commitment to
protecting the environment and its broad range of functions, the WTO has a
solid foundation for this discussion. The problems should now be addressed
in the WTO without delay within an agreed working programme laid out on the
basis of the success achieved in the Uruguay Round.
Previous Gatt practice and negotiations in the Uruguay Round have shown that
not all trade-relevant problems can be covered by the trade policy rules
already on the books. With the increasing internationalisation of markets,
there is an increased overlapping of policies on trade and competition in
the international context. We are particularly challenged by efforts by
companies to restrict competition; and we are faced by government toleration
of such practices.
Private restraints on competition such as orderly marketing, managed trade,
export cartels, mergers to attain commanding market positions, and
displacement strategies by industrial targeting or laser beaming can lead to
serious trade barriers, thus undermining the value of agreements and
concessions made under the Gatt. This can generate political pressure to
react to such competitive distortions by trade policy measures.
Conversely, the employment of legal trade policy instruments such as
safeguards, anti-dumping measures or countervailing duties can distort
competition and restrict trade at both the national and international level
if applied contrary to competitive principles.
If we are to prevent or overcome drawbacks for companies in the European
Union and elsewhere, the following questions must be dealt with:
how can the interest of exporters or investors be protected in the face of
conduct that is contrary to competition?
how can a systematic application of existing national competition rules be
assured and improved so that the present multilateral trading system may be
made even more open and conducive to competition and use of trade policy
measures for competitive reasons may be prevented?
should international rules for competition be established, and, if so, what
elements should they incorporate?
The demand for a discussion of social standards continues to be voiced. This
topic has not yet been addressed in trade policy bodies; it has, however,
been the topic of particular attention by UN bodies. Since a link between
social standards and international trade is undeniable, the discussion will
also have to become part of the agenda of trade policy bodies. Developing
countries suspect that calls for social standards mask protectionist
attempts to reduce the advantages conferred on them by developing status.
Since such discussions are politically sensitive, it would be prudent to
proceed with caution.
The problems listed here are of political interest to many participants in
the multilateral trading system. It is most important to begin consultations
on them as soon as possible at the international and multilateral level and
from the very outset to acknowledge the interdependence between trade, the
environment, competition, and social standards.
