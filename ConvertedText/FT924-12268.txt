FT  21 OCT 92 / Tube staff could be moved to Docklands


   By RICHARD TOMKINS


LONDON Underground yesterday held out the prospect that it could move up to
2,000 of its staff into the troubled Canary Wharf development in London's
Docklands if this would help the Jubilee Line Tube extension to be built.
It said it had been considering its accommodation strategy for some time,
with the aim of bringing together staff currently housed in a number of
buildings on short lease around the capital.
Several of these leases were due to expire in the next few months. The move
to Canary Wharf now being considered would not only bring them together in a
single location but release a property in west London suitable for use as a
training centre.
This in turn would avoid the need for a new building for that purpose.
The move could help Canary Wharf's bankers in putting together a package for
the private-sector contribution demanded by the government towards the cost
of the Jubilee Line extension.
Previously, the banks' offer of funds had been conditional on the the
government relocating civil servants to Canary Wharf.
However, London Underground stressed that this was not a substitute deal
because the two were not linked.
The move was still under consideration, it said, 'but we will not go there
if the Jubilee Line is not built'.
The government's decision on the Jubilee Line extension is expected to be
taken by the cabinet this week.
