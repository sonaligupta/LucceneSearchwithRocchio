FT  12 MAR 92 / Election '92: Donation to Tories not disclosed


   By ANDREW JACK


A LEASING company now owned by Bank Austria made a donation of Pounds
100,000 to the Conservative party in 1990 which was not disclosed in the
company's accounts, it emerged yesterday.
Annual returns for Sovereign Leasing, based in Manchester, show that the new
owners discovered a political donation made in February 1990 but not
previously recorded in the accounts.
News of the contribution comes a week after it was revealed that Mr Asil
Nadir, former chairman of Polly Peck International, contributed Pounds
440,000 to the Conservative party during the 1980s. Some of the money was
drawn on cheques from companies in the group but not disclosed.
The 1985 Companies Act requires that any political or charitable donations
of more than Pounds 200 should be shown in an annual report.
Sovereign was founded by Mr Paul Green and Mr Martin Harrison, two
Manchester entrepreneurs. Mrs Thatcher opened the company's Manchester
headquarters in 1990.
Bank Austria acquired a majority stake in Sovereign in summer 1990 and
bought the remaining shares last June. Mr Green and Mr Harrison resigned at
that time.
Bank Austria said the donation was included in the accounts for the year to
June 30 1991 after it took over the company.
The Conservative party said yesterday: 'We have no duty to police company
law. We accept donations, but they are a private matter.'
