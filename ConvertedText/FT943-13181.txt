FT  21 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Colefax consolidates recovery


   By GRAHAM DELLER


Steadily improving conditions in the UK and the US helped Colefax & Fowler
Group to consolidate on the return to profit shown at the interim stage.
During the 12 months to April 30, the wallpaper and furnishing fabrics
manufacturer swung from losses of Pounds 396,000 to pre-tax profits of
Pounds 331,000, struck after an exceptional charge of Pounds 211,000
following the disposal of a freehold warehouse in New Jersey. The group had
returned to the black at half way with a modest profit of Pounds 50,000
(losses of Pounds 192,000).
Overall sales rose 22 per cent, from Pounds 28.8m to Pounds 35.2m.
Turnover in the product division rose by 10 per cent. Trade sales expanded
by 15 per cent in the UK, by 25 per cent in Europe and by 48 per cent in the
rest of the world, excluding the US. Retail sales, however, remained
difficult and dipped by 10 per cent.
Turnover in the US showed an 8 per cent increase in dollar terms - the first
material growth since 1991, according to Mr David Green, chief executive,
reflecting a showroom refurbishment programme and slightly improved market
conditions.
The group's decorating division had had an 'exceptional year', Mr Green
said, with turnover ahead 75 per cent; this, in turn, had a beneficial
impact on antique sales which rose by 41 per cent.
Kingcome Sofas, the upholstered furniture operation, lifted turnover by 9
per cent following increased factory efficiencies and improved trade demand,
which is continuing into the current year, he said.
Gearing at the year end was 33 per cent (40 per cent).
Earnings emerged at 0.8p, against losses of 1.05p; the final dividend is
held at 0.5p for a maintained total of 1p.
