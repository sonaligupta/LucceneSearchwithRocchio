FT  16 MAR 94 / Deloitte to pay Dollars 312m damages


   By PATRICK HARVERSON


   NEW YORK


Deloitte & Touche has agreed to pay Dollars 312m (Pounds 209m) to settle a
string of government charges that the big US accountancy firm failed
properly to audit several banks and savings and loan institutions which
collapsed in the 1980s.
Yesterday's settlement resolved 15 lawsuits brought against Deloitte by
various government agencies seeking Dollars 1.8bn in damages.
The lawsuits charged Deloitte with professional negligence, claiming that
the firm issued clean audits for institutions that later proved to be
insolvent.
The settlement is the second largest paid by a professional firm involved in
the S&L and bank failures. In 1992 accountancy firm Ernst & Young paid
Dollars 400m after reaching a similar accord with federal authorities.
Although analysts believe that a large part of the Dollars 312m settlement
would be paid by Deloitte's insurers, the firm's partners are expected to
contribute toward the cost of the agreement. However, Mr Michael Cook,
Deloitte's chief executive, described the settlement as a 'business
necessity' and 'fair.'
The Deloitte settlement is not likely to be the last of its kind and further
settlements are expected.
