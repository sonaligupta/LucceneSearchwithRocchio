FT  08 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Canada, China in nuclear deal - Contracts
and Ventures


   By REUTER


   BEIJING


Canada and China yesterday signed deals on nuclear power and friendly aid.
Canadian prime minister Jean Chretien is leading a 300-strong delegation of
top executives and nine provincial premiers. The development aid accord
covers six projects to support Chinese administrative, legal and economic
reforms through the Canadian International Development Agreement. The
nuclear co-operation deal opens the way for trade in nuclear material and
equipment for peaceful uses, including a possible sale of four nuclear power
stations. China is the fifth nuclear-weapon state with which Canada has such
an agreement. The others are the US, Britain, Russia and France. Sale of
four heavy-water reactors would be worth up to USDollars 3.7bn to Canada's
nuclear industry.
Chinese customs figures show that in the first nine months of 1994 Canada
exported to China goods worth USDollars 1.1bn, up 3.8 per cent over the same
period in 1993, and imported Dollars 959m in goods from China, up 12.5 per
cent. China is Canada's fifth largest export market and Canada the 13th
largest market for Beijing, Chinese figures show.
