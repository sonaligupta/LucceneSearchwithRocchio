FT  10 JAN 92 / Letter: Dividends and retained profits not of equal value in
UK


   From R A HAMMOND-CHAMBERS


Sir, The statement in your leading article, 'Dividends in recession'
(January 4) that 'Economic theory suggests that the market should put an
equal value on retained profits and dividends, except to the extent that the
tax system favours one against the other', should be contradicted.
It is not so. the value of retained profits is uncertain and depends on the
return made on their investment in the future. In Japan and Germany, where
retained earnings have as a generalisation been well invested, retained
earnings are highly regarded. In the UK - and other Anglo-Saxon countries -
they have not been so well invested; quite naturally, therefore, investors
in the UK prefer the rather more certain value of dividends.
When corporate UK proves to its shareholders that profits are better used by
the companies for the benefit of the shareholders themselves, then investors
will put a higher value on retained earnings - higher, possibly, than on
dividends.
