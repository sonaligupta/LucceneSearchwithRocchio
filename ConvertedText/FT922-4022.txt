FT  08 JUN 92 / OAS talks of Haiti action

   KINGSTON


SEVERAL members of the Organisation of American States are considering
military intervention in Haiti, after the failure of diplomatic efforts and
an economic embargo to secure the return to office of ousted president
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, writes Canute James in Kingston.
According to diplomats, several Caribbean and Latin American countries are
discussing 'surgical and selective strikes' in Haiti by a multinational
force. The intention would be to 'weaken the resolve' of the Haitian
military to hold on to power. But President Bush said yesterday he was not
yet thinking about using force and hoped sanctions could be made effective.
