FT  12 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Conrad plans capital restructure


   By GARY EVANS


CONRAD Continental yesterday announced a placing and offer to raise Pounds
820,000 together with a capital reorganisation.
At the same time, the Manchester-based leisure and sports group reported
full year pre-tax losses up from Pounds 378,000 to Pounds 486,000, although
the figure for the 12 months to end-December included exceptional costs of
Pounds 111,000 related to reorganisation and restructuring together with
provisions made against certain debtors.
Turnover declined from Pounds 9.16m to Pounds 7.48m. Losses per share were
1.57p against 1.7p.
Mr Rodney Walker, chairman, said the climate throughout the year had
remained harsh and the group had faced difficulty in financing its
activities, which had restricted the level of trading in recent months.
The group plans to issue 24.99m new ordinary shares. Of these, 12m have been
conditionally placed at 4p apiece, while shareholders are asked to subscribe
for the remaining 12.99m at the offer price of 4p.
Under the capital reorganisation, existing shareholders will receive one new
ordinary 1p share and nine deferred 1p shares in exchange for every existing
10p share.
The rights of each 1p ordinary will be equal to the rights of each existing
10p ordinary.
