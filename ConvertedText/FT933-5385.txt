FT  03 SEP 93 / Rolls-Royce issues Pounds 307m cash call


   By ROLAND RUDD


ROLLS-ROYCE, the aero-engine manufacturer, yesterday launched its first cash
call since it was privatised five years ago with a 1-for-4 rights issue to
raise Pounds 307m.
The money is to be used to fund investment, mainly on the Trent engine, and
the cost of reducing its workforce. It will also eliminate borrowings.
The new shares are being offered at 130p each. The existing shares fell 11p
to 152 1/2 p. Rolls-Royce also unveiled its half-year results to June 30,
showing a 55 per cent increase in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 20m to Pounds
31m. Operating profits rose to Pounds 156m (Pounds 150m) on increased sales
of Pounds 1.7bn (Pounds 1.6bn).
Sir Ralph Robins, chairman, said the order book, at Pounds 6.4bn, had proved
strong but warned that the outlook was still fragile.
The restructuring programme, announced in March, is ahead of plan, and the
workforce has been cut by 2,900 to 48,900. There is no exceptional charge as
Pounds 180m was provided for the restructuring last year, of which Pounds
41m was used in the first half. There are unlikely to be any more provisions
taken.
Sir Ralph said: 'We would not flinch from further reductions in the
workforce if the market required it. But we do not see the need for any
further losses other than those already announced.'
The restructuring programme and late payment of bills are responsible for a
net cash outflow from operating activities of Pounds 115m compared to a cash
inflow of Pounds 45m.
Industrial and aerospace's profits before interest and after exceptional
charges rose to Pounds 35m (Pounds 28m) and Pounds 5 (Pounds 2m)
respectively.
Sir Ralph said the military operations remained profitable 'but were not
contributing in the way they had in the past'. Military engine deliveries
are not expected to pick up until 1996.
The company has asked the Department of Trade and Industry to raise the
maximum level of foreign ownership which stands at 29.5 per cent. It was
recently forced to ask foreign investors to sell their holding in the
company after the permitted level was breached.
Earnings per share rose to 2.27p (0.93p), although before exceptional items
last year's earnings were 2.39p. The interim dividend is cut by 0.55p to 2p.
The company forecasts an unchanged total of 5p.
