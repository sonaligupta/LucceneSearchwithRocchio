FT  16 DEC 94 / International Company News: Greencore ahead 17% after lower
interest cost


   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN

Greencore, the sugar, malting and milling group, reported a 17 per cent
increase in pre-tax profits from IPounds 33.7m to IPounds 39.5m (Pounds
38.9m) for the year to September 30, reflecting a sharp reduction in net
interest costs and further efficiency gains.
Sugar, agribusiness and other food operations all recorded increases in
profits. Only the malting business suffered a fall, reflecting difficult
marketing conditions and high domestic barley prices in 1993.
Group sales increased to IPounds 404.5m (IPounds 393.8m) including IPounds
175,000 (IPounds 1.46m) from discontinued activities giving an underlying
rise of 3 per cent.
This in part reflected a fall in sugar sales, following poor crop yields in
1993. Retail sugar demand, about 25 per cent of total sugar volume, showed a
small decline in a difficult market.
Mr Bernie Cahill, chairman, said agribusiness was responding well to reforms
of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy. He welcomed the agreed reduction in
'set aside' - the land farmers are required to take out of production - from
15 per cent to 12 per cent, which would result in increased processing
volumes.
He added that the outlook for the Irish and Belgian malt businesses was
improving on the back of the upturn in the beer and spirits markets. Flour
and consumer food operations increased volumes, particularly exports.
Interest costs were cut by IPounds 5m to IPounds 4.26m, underlining
continued strong cash flow and reduced working capital requirements.
Earnings per share increased 13 per cent to 38.4p (33.9p) and a final
dividend of 6.2p is proposed for a total of 9.9p (8.8p).
