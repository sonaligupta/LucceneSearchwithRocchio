FT  01 NOV 93 / International Company News: Paper groups hit by low prices


   By EMIKO TERAZONO

INTERIM earnings at Japan's leading paper and pulp companies exemplified
problems facing the industry, as sluggish demand and high competition
depressed profit margins.
Nippon Paper Industries, Daishowa Paper and Honshu Paper were hit by lower
paper prices. Honshu managed to lift its profit figure due to a decline in
interest payment as interest rates have fallen.
The depressed business environment has accelerated restructuring of the
industry. Last April, Jujo Paper and Sanyo-Kokusaku Pulp merged to create
Nippon Paper Industries, and Kanzaki Paper and Oji Paper merged to form New
Oji Paper last October.
Nippon Paper, the industry leader, said paper sales fell 8 per cent to
Y232.7bn (Dollars 2.2bn) while sales for pulp and chemicals declined 19 per
cent and building materials decreased 17 per cent. After-tax profits jumped
53 per cent to Y5.4bn thanks to profits from stock sales linked to the stock
market listing of a subsidiary.
Paper sales at Honshu fell 6.6 per cent to Y89.5bn, while Daishowa, led by
the Saito family, known for its extensive purchases of French impressionist
art during the late 1980s, posted a 7.5 per cent decline to Y135.7bn.
For the year to March, lower paper prices will continue to squeeze earnings.
Nippon Paper expects lower costs to lift operating profits, but a fall in
gains from securities holdings will depress non-consolidated pre-tax profits
by 25 per cent to 8.5bn on a 4 per cent fall in sales of Y642bn.
Daishowa posted Y10.8bn in unrealised losses on its securities portfolio at
the end of September. It sees a pre-tax loss of Y21.8bn on a 6.7 per cent
fall in sales to Y289bn. Honshu sees sales falling 4.4 per cent to Y372.6bn
but expects support from lower interest rates, and sees pre-tax profits
rising 8.1 per cent to Y6.6bn.
