FT  02 NOV 93 / International Company News: Charge pushes Cigna into the red


   By RICHARD WATERS


A Dollars 244m after-tax charge to cover asbestosis and environmental claims
pushed Cigna, the US insurer, into the red during the third quarter of the
year.
The company also took a Dollars 107m charge to cover 1,400 redundancies in
its health and property/casualty businesses, which have already been
reported, as well as a further 800-1,000 job losses expected in the next 18
months.
The latest charges led Cigna, one of the leaders in the US health and life
insurance businesses, to report a net loss of Dollars 94m, or Dollars 1.31 a
share, for the period, compared with a net profit of Dollars 50m, or 70
cents, a year ago.
The scale of the loss was reduced by a Dollars 48m benefit from the change
in the US corporate tax rate.
The results a year before had been struck after one-off items which led to a
net benefit of Dollars 42m.
Operating results during the period in health, pension and life businesses
had been strong, said Mr Wilson Taylor, chief executive.
Despite a reduction in catastrophe insurance losses, which were reduced from
Dollars 139m to Dollars 36m, Mr Taylor said underlying performance in the
property/casualty business remained poor.
