FT  22 OCT 92 / Japanese to investigate petrochemical project

JAPAN'S six leading trading houses have reached an agreement to conduct a
feasibility study into the building of a Dollars 4bn petrochemical complex,
in the northern Chinese province of Liaoning.
The complex would be one of the largest foreign investment projects in
China. Mitsubishi Corporation, the trading house, said yesterday the
Japanese side would provide at least 51 per cent of the Dollars 4bn.
Mitsubishi said the Chinese government had given formal permission for the
feasibility study, likely to begin early next year and take at least a year
to complete. If all went to plan, the complex, to include an oil refinery
and a 450,000 tonnes-a-year ethylene facility, would be completed by the end
of the decade.
The proposal by the partners - including Marubeni, Sumitomo, Mitsui, Itochu,
and Nissho Iwai - reflects heightened interest in China for production
facilities. Japanese investment there rose from Dollars 349m in 1990 to
Dollars 579m last year.
Mitsubishi said some of the oil for the plant was likely to come from the
northern Chinese field of Daqing. Thaw after winter, Page 15
