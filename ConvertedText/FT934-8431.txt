FT  16 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Paris woos farmers with more aid


   By DAVID BUCHAN


   PARIS


THE French government yesterday moved to soothe its farmers' anxiety about
the impact of a possible Gatt trade deal by granting them an extra FFr1.5bn
(Pounds 170m) in aid next year.
The extra aid, which will take the form of lower welfare charges and
increased pensions for farmers, comes on top of the government's plan to
increase its 1994 agriculture budget by FFr3bn to FFr47bn.
Government and farm union officials denied it was a pay-off for French
farmers agreeing to scale down their demands for revision of the
controversial Blair House farm trade accord with the US. They stressed that
the aid was designed to help French farmers adapt to the European Union's
earlier reform of its common agricultural policy.
But the farmers' unions have been remarkably docile since September when
France's European Union partners partially endorsed Paris' demands for
change in the Blair House accord.
This has left observers puzzled as to whether the farmers really believe the
government will stand in the last ditch with them over Gatt, or whether they
have come to regard concession by France as inevitable.
