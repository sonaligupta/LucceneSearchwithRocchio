FT  22 OCT 92 / Arts: Today's Television


   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY


Mel Smith and Griff Rhys Jones are undeniably successful comedians; their
programmes win high ratings and awards. Many of us find them very funny. But
shall we ever become as fond of them as our parents were of Morecambe and
Wise? It seems doubtful. Tonight they begin a new series of Smith And Jones
(9.35 BBC1) which, these days, serves largely as the showreel for their big
money making business which is in TV and radio commercials and training
films.
Thursdays are now packed with comedies, many of them repeats including As
Time Goes By (8.00 BBC1), one of those bittersweet, mumsy middle-aged series
with Judi Dench drenched in nostalgia. Rising Damp (8.30 C4), made in the
mid-seventies, is a goodish vehicle for Leonard Rossiter, who plays a grubby
landlord smitten with one of his tenants. Best of the lot is Waiting For God
(8.30 BBC1) with Graham Crowden and Stephanie Cole as a couple of
magnificently bolshie inmates of an old people's home. Last week's episode
of Bottom (9.00 BBC2) proved that some, anyway, of this second batch from
Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson is as madly inspired as 'The Young Ones'.
