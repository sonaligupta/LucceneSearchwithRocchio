FT  01 JUL 92 / Guilty plea in Exxon case


   By ALAN FRIEDMAN


   NEW YORK


MRS Irene Seale pleaded guilty yesterday to extortion and conspiracy to
commit extortion in connection with the fatal kidnapping of Mr Sidney Reso,
the Exxon executive whose body was found last weekend, writes Alan Friedman
in New York.
US law enforcement officials said Mrs Seale had also agreed to enter a
guilty plea on state kidnapping charges, but federal kidnapping and other
charges would be dismissed as part of a plea agreement. The plea bargain,
which still stipulates a minimum prison term of 20 years, was agreed after
Mrs Seale began co-operating with prosecutors. It is understood that her
information led the FBI to the wooded area in southern New Jersey where Mr
Reso's corpse was buried.
Mrs Seale's husband - Mr Arthur Seale, a former Exxon security guard - is
expected to face murder charges. The Seales were arrested on kidnap,
extortion and conspiracy charges on June 19. Mr Reso apparently died several
days after suffering a gunshot wound to the arm.
