FT  24 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Sikorsky, Mitsubishi study plan for
19-seat helicopter


   By PAUL BETTS


SIKORSKY, the US helicopter maker, part of the United Technologies group, is
studying with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of Japan the development of a
19-seat civil helicopter, Paul Betts writes. The S-92 helicopter would be
the first civil helicopter programme launched by Sikorsky since 1978 and
would replace the S-61 the company produced between 1962-1981.
Mr Mike Baxter, Sikorsky's vice-president of international and commercial
business, said Mitsubishi had not yet committed itself to a joint venture.
But Mitsubishi, a Sikorsky licensee during the past 30 years, has agreed to
study the potential market.
Sikorsky said other potential partners in Asia and Europe were interested.
The US group is expected to decide whether to launch the programme by the
end of this year.
The US-led helicopter programme would compete against plans by Eurocopter,
the new European helicopter group which has absorbed the helicopter
activities of Aerospatiale of France and Germany's
Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm, to develop a new version of Aerospatiale's Super
Puma helicopter, the Mark 2. Sikorsky is expected to target the offshore oil
industry for its new helicopter.
