FT  16 NOV 93 / Doncaster pit closure announced


BENTLEY colliery near Doncaster, South Yorkshire, is to close on December 3,
British Coal said yesterday.
The pit, which employs 450 people, was one of 12 for which the government
announced a reprieve in March.
Bentley's pithead stocks of 600,000 tonnes are equivalent to more than six
months' production and about three-quarters of the pit's weekly output of
20,000 tonnes is being added to the stockpile.
British Coal also announced that 60 jobs are to be lost at Tower colliery in
Mid Glamorgan to reduce production because of overcapacity. Tower is the
last working pit in south Wales and has a stockpile of about 500,000 tonnes.
