   By ANDREW BAXTER


OTIS ELEVATOR, the world's largest lift maker, yesterday announced a joint
venture with the Ukraine state committee on housing and community services
to make, sell, install and maintain lifts in Ukraine. Otis will have a 51
per cent stake in UKR Otis, to employ 4,900 people at a factory in Kiev and
maintenance operations in Kharkov and Donetsk.
The venture is the third in the former Soviet Union for Otis. UKR Otis will
co-ordinate activities with Otis joint ventures in Shcherbinka, near Moscow,
and St. Petersburg. Otis will invest in re-equipping the existing Kiev
factory, to be making 3,500 lifts a year by 1996.
