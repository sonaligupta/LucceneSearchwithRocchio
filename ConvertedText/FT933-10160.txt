FT  05 AUG 93 / International Company News: Berlusconi arm may be floated

SILVIO Berlusconi Editore, the Italian publisher owned by Mr Silvio
Berlusconi's Fininvest group, could be floated within the next three months,
raising up to L600bn (Dollars 376m) for the heavily-indebted parent company.
Fininvest recently announced its group indebtedness rose to L3,333bn at the
end of last year, from L2,938bn in 1991. Bankers have expressed growing
concerns about its debts, built up during the heady expansion of the late
1980s, and about the downturn in advertising revenues at its core
broadcasting business.
Fininvest said net group profits for 1992 plunged to L21.1bn from L61.3bn in
1991. The decline was ascribed to higher interest costs and the effects of
the recession. Group sales rose slightly to L10,469bn from L10,096bn.
Adjusted for disposals, turnover climbed by 6.8 per cent.
SBE will this month launch a reverse takeover of Mondadori, Italy's biggest
publishing group, which is controlled by Fininvest. Although Mondadori is
listed on the stock market, Fininvest owns about 90 per cent of its ordinary
shares and 80 per cent of the non-voting savings stock. Placing a greater
proportion of the shares in the combined SBE-Mondadori group should give
Fininvest a substantial cash injection to bring down borrowings.
Fininvest said prospects for the current year were good, with retailing
performing particularly strongly. Sales at Standa, the Fininvest-controlled
supermarkets and stores chain, jumped by more than 20 per cent in the first
half, due partly to acquisitions. Revenues at Fininvest's insurance and
financial services operations had risen by over 30 per cent.
Analysts believe Fininvest may also be considering floating its television
broadcasting interests, currently grouped in the RTI subsidiary. Although Mr
Berlusconi has traditionally been reluctant to bring in outside
shareholders, growing financial and political pressures may increasingly
oblige him to change tack.
Last week, he admitted that listing RTI was being considered, but said no
timetable had been established.
