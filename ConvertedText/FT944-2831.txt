FT  15 DEC 94 / British Gas may cut shop staff pay


   By ROBERT CORZINE


British Gas yesterday warned of possible pay cuts for staff in high-street
showrooms as part of its programme to improve competitiveness, Robert
Corzine writes.
A letter to showroom staff said that pay levels in British Gas shops were
well above those for similar retailers, such as Comet and Rumbelows.
The letter was sent just weeks after the company announced a controversial
75 per cent rise for Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive.
Earlier this year British Gas announced a big closure programme among its
high-street shops, which form one of the least profitable parts of its
operations.
