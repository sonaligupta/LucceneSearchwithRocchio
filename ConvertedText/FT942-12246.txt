FT  30 APR 94 / UK Company News: Ransomes shares climb 10% on upbeat
statement


   By PAUL TAYLOR


Shares in Ransomes, the lossmaking manufacturer of grass cutting equipment,
rose by 10 per cent to 22p yesterday, after the group's chairman, Mr John
Clement, gave an upbeat assessment of current trading at the annual meeting.
He indicated that the group, which has Pounds 75m of bank debt, was
negotiating the sale of some of its surplus property.
Mr Clements also told shareholders the company was considering 'many
options' for refinancing.
Earlier this month, Ransomes decided to pay its overdue convertible
preference share dividend and launched an attack on Steinhardt Partners, the
US hedge fund manager which has bought 30 per cent of the preference shares.
Ransomes has rejected proposals it has received from Steinhardt for a
recapitalisation, involving conversion of the preference shares into
ordinary shares.
