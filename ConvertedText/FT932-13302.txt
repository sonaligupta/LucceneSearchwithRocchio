FT  23 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Late selling reverses rise on
earnings news


   By PATRICK HARVERSON


   NEW YORK


Wall Street
AFTER posting early gains amid a number of strong earnings reports, a burst
of late selling and heavy losses in transportation shares left US stock
markets lower on balance yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 10.27 at 3,429.17,
well off its high for the day of 3,471.05. The more broadly based Standard &
Poor's 500 lost 4.17 at 439.46 and the Nasdaq composite ended 0.53 easier at
663.51. Trading volume on the New York SE amounted to a hefty 310.4m shares.
Trading opened against a background of conflicting factors, including the
cut in German interest rates, news of a rise in US weekly jobless claims,
and falling bond prices. The German rate cut had little impact on market
sentiment, primarily because the Bundesbank's move failed to give the dollar
a lasting boost.
The news of a 26,000 rise in weekly jobless claims was worrying, but
investors shrugged it off, and shares rose steadily for most of the day.
Soon after 2pm, however, prices turned around, and fell into negative
territory just before the close. Throughout the day, attention was primarily
focused on corporate earnings.
The day's main feature was Caterpillar, which jumped Dollars 5 3/8 to
Dollars 67 5/8 in busy trading after the company bounced back from a big
loss in the first quarter last year to post a net profit of Dollars 34m in
the wake of stronger demand in the US market and improved margins. The
earnings were better than analysts had expected, and prompted several
brokerage houses to upgrade their ratings and raise their earnings estimates
for the company.
Among other stocks to advance on news of improved earnings were Dow
Chemical, which climbed Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 56 in volume of 2m shares
after the company reported net income of Dollars 1.47 a share, up from 65
cents a share a year earlier.
Airline issues relinquished part of Wednesday's big gains as some investors
took the opportunity to book some quick profits. USAir retreated Dollars 2
to Dollars 22 1/4 , AMR Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 70 1/8 , UAL Dollars 2 7/8
to Dollars 146 7/8 and Delta Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 57 5/8 . Delta
announced a net loss of Dollars 134m in the third fiscal quarter after
taking an Dollars 82.5m restructuring charge.
Also in the transportation sector, Consolidated Rail dropped Dollars 5 1/2
to Dollars 51 3/4 after reporting higher than expected quarterly worker
injury costs.
On the Nasdaq market, MCI Communications moved forward Dollars 1 7/8 to
Dollars 49 on news of better earnings.

THE TORONTO market was directionless again yesterday but in further active
trading. The TSE 300 Index gained 2.1 at 3,665.7 and advances held a modest
lead over declines by 381 to 316. Volume rose to 77m shares (valued at
CDollars 650.8m) from Wednesday's 72.6m.
Among the sub-indices, seven were lower and seven were higher. The gold
shares sector recorded the day's biggest change, up 2.07 per cent, while the
energy group put on 1.24 per cent.
