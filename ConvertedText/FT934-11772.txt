FT  29 OCT 93 / UK Company News: ICD's dissidents call meeting


SHAREHOLDERS representing 12 per cent of the equity of International
Communication & Data have requisitioned an extraordinary meeting of the
company to consider board changes.
The notice was issued to ICD by the PSB Group's advisers and was signed on
behalf of various nominee companies holding a total of 6.87m ICD shares (12
per cent).
PSB is proposing resolutions for the removal from the ICD board of Mr David
Cicurel, chairman, Mr Ralph Elman, finance director, and Mr Daniel Unger,
non-executive director.
If the resolutions are passed, Mr S Kingsland, Mr J Self and Mr J Porter
would be appointed to the board, thus giving the PSB candidates control of
ICD's board.
The ICD directors, who hold 2.5 per cent of the shares and are being advised
by Dawnay Day, will recommend shareholders to vote against the proposed
resolutions.
They said they would 'resist PSB's attempt to take board control without
making a general offer to all shareholders.'
Notice of the requisitioned meeting will be sent to ICD shareholders in due
course.
