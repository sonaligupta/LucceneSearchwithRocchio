FT  27 MAY 93 / State sell-off 'disappointing'


   By JAMES BLITZ, Economics Staff


PRIVATISATION of Russia's small and medium-sized enterprises has been
disappointing in terms of its effects on companies' management structures
and business operations, according to a report issued yesterday under the
auspices of the UK Treasury.
The report, compiled by KPMG Management Consultancy and Heriot-Watt
University, says 46,000 medium-sized enterprises had been officially
privatised by January of this year, including 6 per cent of Russia's shops
and 5 per cent of its restaurants.
But the report's authors discovered that the act of privatising a company
had, in most cases, amounted to little more than a technical liberation from
state control. The report says privatised enterprises retained the same
management structures and personnel as had existed under the Soviet regime,
and indulged in little new investment or restructuring.
Most work collectives opted for sale of shares in a joint-stock company,
with 51 per cent control going to management and employees. But surveying
enterprises in Moscow, Volgograd and Nizhny Novgorod researchers discovered
that workers and management did not use this as an opportunity for change.
'The prevailing attitude was one of defending the status quo, particularly
employment and welfare provisions.'
