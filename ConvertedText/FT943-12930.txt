FT  22 JUL 94 / Council workers to decide on offer


   By LISA WOOD


Unions representing local-government workers yesterday took a stand-off
position towards a pay offer said to be worth 4.3 per cent to their 1.5m
white-collar and manual members, Lisa Wood writes.
Workers including school caretakers, secretaries and refuse collectors will
now be asked by Unison, the public-services union, and the TGWU and GMB
general unions what action they want to take.
The offer from the Local Government Management Board, which represents
councils in England and Wales, was improved yesterday. It proposes a
two-stage increase - over 19 months for manual workers and over 21 months
for white-collar workers - with 2.3 per cent followed by a further 2 per
cent. It includes a flat-rate rise of Pounds 75 a year.
Unison, which publicly took a more aggressive attitude towards the offer
than the other unions, said it could not recommend the offer to its members.
It did not say, however, that it rejected the offer.
The deal would add Pounds 535m to local authorities' pay bills in England
and Wales.
