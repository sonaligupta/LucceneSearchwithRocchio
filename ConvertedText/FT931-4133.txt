FT  12 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Major attacked over R-R job losses


   By IVOR OWEN


MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, was fiercely attacked by Labour MPs in
the Commons yesterday when he insisted that the 'distressing' job losses
announced by Rolls-Royce did not warrant government intervention, Ivor Owen
writes.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, contrasted the prime minister's
'do-nothing' attitude to the loss of 5,000 engineering jobs with his recent
assurances that manufacturing mattered to the government.
Mr Major accused Mr Smith of forgetting the government's measures to secure
economic growth and international competitiveness.
The prime minister was adamant that the country did not need the kind of
'nannying intervention' advocated by the Labour leader.
Mr Smith scoffed: 'That litany of self-serving excuses gives no comfort to
the 5,000 people who are going to lose their jobs'. The prime minister
emphasised that Rolls-Royce, like its US competitors, was shedding jobs
because of the international market.
