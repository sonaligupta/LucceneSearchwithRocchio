FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Everest shares fall 9p on warning about
static second half results


Shares in Everest Foods tumbled 9p to 68p yesterday after the West
Midlands-based egg and chip producer said it was unlikely to achieve full
year profits in accordance with market expectations.
Mr Bob Gilbert, chairman, said the trend towards economy products had
resulted in severe pressure on margins.
This meant that pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 1.18m to Pounds 1.08m in
the six months to November 30, although turnover grew by nearly Pounds 3m to
Pounds 19m.
The company had taken steps to make manufacturing processes as cost
effective as possible. However, Mr Gilbert warned that if current trading
conditions persisted, full year profits were unlikely to improve
substantially on the interim figure.
Although earnings per share slipped from 3.15p to 2.9p, the interim dividend
has been held at 1.2p and a scrip dividend alternative proposed.
