IRAN has increased investment in oil, gas and petrochemical industries this
year by a quarter to 1.5 trillion (million million) rials - Dollars 1bn at
the floating exchange rate, Mr Gholamreza Aqazadeh, the oil minister, said,
Reuter reports from Nicosia.
In an interview quoted by Iran's IRNA news agency, Mr Aqazadeh said the oil
ministry was drawing up extensive exploration plans to 1999, with priority
given to border areas.
The minister said seismographic works in an area measuring several thousand
square kilometres in the Caspian Sea would be carried out before the end of
the year.
Mr Aqazadeh said Iran's estimated gas reserves of 20 trillion cubic metres
and oil deposits of 92bn barrels would last 400 and 60 years, respectively,
at production rates just above the current levels.
