FT  23 APR 93 / International Company News: Kao turns in improvement


   By CHARLES LEADBEATER


IN SPITE of the slump in consumer spending, Japanese women are still
spending heavily on cosmetics and personal hygiene products, according to
Kao, the country's leading household products manufacturer, writes Charles
Leadbeater.
Yesterday, it reported a 17 per cent increase in group pre-tax profits to
Y45.32bn (Dollars 408m) for the year to the end of March from Y38.62bn a
year earlier. Consolidated sales rose by 5.7 per cent to Y771.27bn from
Y729.88bn.
Group earnings per share fell 7.6 per cent to Y34.07 from Y36.87 reflecting
an increase in the number of outstanding shares following a one-for-10 stock
split during the year.
The directors set the final dividend at Y5 a share, making an unchanged Y10
for the year.
