FT  16 MAR 94 / German town angered by new Iron Curtain


   By REUTER


   BERLIN


The euphoria in the eastern German town of Hotensleben, some 185km west of
Berlin, when the Iron Curtain was dismantled has turned to amazement and
anger since their local leaders decided to rebuild part of it as a monument
to the cold war, Reuter reports from Berlin.
Eager to halt the decline of Hotensleben since German unification, a small
group of civic dignitaries last year began rebuilding a 330-metre (1,080ft)
section of the 'death strip' which kept east Germans from escaping to the
west. Hoping to slow a sharp rise in unemployment and reverse a demoralising
westward migration of many of its 2,600 citizens, they decided to capitalise
on the town's isolated location during the cold war with a unique tourist
attraction.
They have spent DM135,000 (Pounds 52,500) - some of it government money - to
repair and rebuild it, complete with guard towers, spotlights and attack
dogs.
'It's pure insanity,' said Dr Franz Wehe, a retired surgeon who lives next
to the rebuilt wall. 'That damn thing was here for 30 years so why do we
have to look at it now?' Nearly 500 people in Hotensleben have signed
petitions protesting against the monument.
The monument was to have been completed by 1996 but the protests brought a
quick halt to federal funding. Annoyed and undaunted, the proponents are
seeking DM300,000 in private funding to complete the monument.
