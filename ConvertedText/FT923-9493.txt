FT  05 AUG 92 / Letter: Moral philosophy that should not be forgotten


   From Mr AUBREY JONES


Sir, You are quite right to remind us that Adam Smith was a moral
philosopher as well as an economist ('Ethics and worse', July 31). Indeed,
his economics was secondary to his moral philosophy.
This is clearly seen in this quotation from the Wealth of Nations: 'Every
man, so long as he does not violate the laws of justice, is left perfectly
free to pursue his own interest in his own way' (italics mine).
Similarly the expression 'laissez-faire', as used by the French physiocrats,
was subordinate to the idea of a divine plan which could be discovered by
human reason; 'laissez-faire' meant that, when this moral order had been
found, no hindrance should be placed in its way.
What seems to have happened is that, in the long transition from medieval
Christendom to modern secularism, the origins of many of the ideas that
marked that transition have become forgotten.
Dixons, in donating to the London Business School a chair in business
ethics, deserve our thanks for reminding us whence we have come.
