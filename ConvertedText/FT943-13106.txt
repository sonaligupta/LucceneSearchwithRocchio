FT  21 JUL 94 / If not vindicated, certainly a little wiser: The
Bundesbank's totems are set to emerge intact


   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES


The Bundesbank's credibility has been called into question and its monetary
management methods have been mocked. But both of these totems, counted among
its most prized assets, appear likely to emerge intact from the travails of
the past few months.
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the German central bank's president, may even come
through with his reputation as a pragmatic monetarist enhanced. The record
of Mr Otmar Issing, the bank's high priest of monetary orthodoxy, may be
similarly embellished.
Both, together with their fellows on the bank's central council, are already
a little wiser, and keen on learning more.
No one wants a repetition of this year's experiences with the bank's main
policy guidance system, the M3 monetary aggregate, which went haywire at the
turn of the year and is only now settling down. And while the bank's
policy-makers seem to enjoy springing surprises with the timing of their
interest rate changes, the markets' bewilderment at their last discount rate
cut in mid-May is not an experience they want to repeat.
Some signs of new thinking may emerge today after the council's mid-year
review of M3 performance. But it is already plain the over-riding message
will be a re-affirmation of faith in monetary targeting. Even though the
concept has been dropped in all other leading industrial countries, the
Bundesbank insists it is the most reliable indicator of possible inflation.
The M3 components of cash or short-term, easily-accessible savings not
safely locked up in long-term bonds or other instruments - so-called
monetary capital - are a potential threat to monetary stability, it says.
Accordingly, the idea that the bank should welcome news that money supply is
expanding at double its intended rate would in normal circumstances be
beyond belief. But that was the case on Tuesday this week, when it announced
M3 grew in June at an annualised, seasonally-adjusted 11.3 per cent,
compared with the target range of 4-6 per cent.
The fact that the result was better than Bundesbank watchers had expected
was one reason for satisfaction. But more important, the fact that the
figures showed 'special factors' that bloated the measure were starting to
unwind, tended to support Mr Otmar Issing's fundamental belief in the
underlying virtues of M3.
But the council will today examine a wider horizon than the two percentage
point span of this year's target range. Mr Tietmeyer said yesterday the bank
was studying new factors which could influence M3 - 'new phenomena stemming
from the internationalisation of capital movements'.
In the light of widespread scepticism about the usefulness of the measure,
it may also contemplate ways of sharpening assessment of the apparently
endless flow of the distorting 'special factors'.
The effects of German unification, tax changes and currency market
interventions, for example, have conspired to keep M3 off track for the past
three years. As Mr Tietmeyer suggested, future shocks are more likely than
not as Germany becomes increasingly enmeshed in fast-moving global markets.
One aim of the central council debate will be to sharpen the efficiency of
the bank's long-range radar. Another will be to improve internal and
external communications. Failings in both departments appeared to catch the
bank napping earlier this year, when January's M3 growth figure, a
thundering 21.2 per cent, came in accompanied by a bland statement blaming
special factors. A sell-off followed in international markets already
rattled by fears of rising US inflation. It was not, as Mr Tietmeyer
acknowledged, 'a championship performance'.
But conflicting statements and apparently contradictory actions by the bank
were later to compound suspicions that it did not really know what was
happening to M3. The liquidity log-jam was refusing to break up. Meanwhile -
and contrary to its established practice of raising rates to choke off
monetary growth and potential inflation - the bank was seen to be cutting
them on the basis of a bright short-term inflationary outlook.
The mid-May cut in the discount rate was widely seen as an uncharacteristic
gamble by a notoriously conservative institution. That view has moderated
now that funds stuck in short-term deposits seem to be moving outside the
scope of M3. An emboldened Mr Issing said earlier this week it was now not
beyond the bounds of possibility for M3 to end the year at or close to
target.
Similarly encouraged, Mr Tietmeyer said yesterday the bank believed there
were, so far, no inflationary dangers associated with the latest bout of
money supply distortions.
Such comforting comments will no doubt go down well in still-jittery
markets. More comforting still would be a continuing series of declining M3
numbers for the rest of the year. Even better, and despite recent
controversy, another discount rate cut in the interim would be the strongest
possible indicator that the Bundesbank had regained its full confidence in
M3, and, crucially, in its ability to interpret and control it.
