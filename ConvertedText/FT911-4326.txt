FT  19 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Changes at Revenue urged


   By MICHAEL SMITH


THE Inland Revenue was urged yesterday to replace the five pay agreements
covering staff in the department with a unified grading structure as a way
of increasing opportunities for staff, writes Michael Smith.
The Inland Revenue Staff Federation said the organisation's existing
structure made it difficult for staff to move between different areas of the
department and was 'a recipe for disharmony rather than team spirit'.
The recommendation comes in a submission on proposed changes for the Revenue
which the union wants to see as part of the government's plan to create
executive agencies with more autonomy than traditional civil service
departments.
The IRSF says the existence of separate staff groups has resulted in unequal
pay and opportunities. It wants an 'open promotion' system and a review of
staff appraisal, promotion and training systems to utilise staff potential
and help raise the quality of service.
