FT  01 DEC 94 / Gephardt re-elected as leader


   By AP


   WASHINGTON


Democrats in the House of Representatives, where they are now the minority
party, yesterday re-elected Mr Richard Gephardt as their leader, AP reports
from Washington.
Brushing aside conservative pressure for a shake-up after the Democrats'
defeat in the mid-term elections, Mr Gephardt beat Mr Charlie Rose of North
Carolina, by 150 votes to 58, to keep the post he has held since 1989. The
outcome ensures that he remains leader for the next two years.
