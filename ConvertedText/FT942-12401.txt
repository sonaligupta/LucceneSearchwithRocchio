FT  29 APR 94 / UK Company News: Scottish Mortgage beats benchmarks


   By BETHAN HUTTON


Net asset value at Scottish Mortgage and Trust, Baillie Gifford's flagship
international general investment trust, rose by 17 per cent to 257.4p per
share over the year to March 31, beating both the FT-SE-A All-Share Index
and the FT-A World Index over the same period.
Total net assets reached a new year-end high of Pounds 1.04bn at end-March,
compared with Pounds 1.03bn a year earlier.
The trust said it had not made any significant strategic shifts in asset
allocation, apart from a slight reduction of exposure to the smaller Pacific
markets at the end of 1993 on the grounds that they were overvalued.
However, the trust said it was still enthusiastic about the region for the
long term.
As at March 31, some 51 per cent of the trust's assets were in UK equities,
compared with 48.7 per cent 12 months earlier.
Japan accounted for 4 per cent (2.9 per cent), and other Pacific markets
14.1 per cent (10.3 per cent).
The sale by the end of 1993 of a portfolio of gilts, which had been financed
largely by variable rate borrowings, contributed to profits.
The trust has since acquired a new gilt portfolio during market weakness,
again using variable rate borrowings.
Earnings advanced by 7 per cent, to 4.12p per share.
A final dividend of 2.75p is proposed, giving a total of 4.1p, up 2.5 per
cent from last year's 4p, an increase marginally ahead of inflation.
