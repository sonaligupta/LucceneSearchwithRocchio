FT  15 JUN 93 / 45% of small businesses 'have been victims of crime'


   By CHARLES BATCHELOR


NEARLY HALF of all small businesses have been the victims of crime,
according to a survey published yesterday by the Forum of Private Business.
Of 2,670 companies surveyed 45 per cent had been affected by crime. Burglary
was the most common problem, affecting 45 per cent of the victims. It was
followed by vandalism (31 per cent), theft (27 per cent), vehicle crime (24
per cent), shoplifting (17 per cent), and fraud (11 per cent).
In a follow-up poll 90 per cent of business owners called for greater powers
for the police and courts.
Finance firms were the most common targets for burglary followed by
manufacturing and wholesale. Construction and retail businesses suffered
most from vandalism.
Businesses of fewer than four people were least affected by crime. Small
businesses suffered most from shoplifting and fraud, while medium-sized
firms were disproportionately affected by vehicle-related crime, theft and
vandalism.
The north of England was affected more than any other region.
