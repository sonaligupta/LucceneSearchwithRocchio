FT  06 JAN 94 / Euro-citizens condemn open borders delay


   By ANDREW HILL


   BRUSSELS


The European Union's attempt to end passport controls at internal borders
has been 'a catalogue of broken promises', according to a Europe-wide
citizens' lobby group.
Euro Citizen Action Service (Ecas) yesterday condemned the European
Commission and EU member states for failing to abolish checks at internal
borders, a year after the original deadline of January 1, 1993.
Since then, the nine members of the Schengen free-travel zone - all EU
countries except Britain, Denmark and Ireland - have set and missed two
further deadlines and are now aiming to abolish passport checks on February
1.
But Mr Tony Venables, who heads Ecas, yesterday cast doubt on the countries'
ability to meet the new deadline. Schengen officials admitted yesterday they
could not guarantee that a new computer system, linking national immigration
and police authorities, would be in place in time.
'What we are protesting about is that nothing really changed after January
(1993): the same habit of systematic bureaucratic controls continues
everywhere, especially at borders,' Mr Venables told a press conference
yesterday.
Ecas yesterday launched a new telephone 'hotline'*, which will allow
European citizens to complain about problems with border controls after
February 1. Ecas received more than 700 calls, letters and fax messages
about border controls when it ran a similar hotline last January. The
European parliament has already lodged a complaint against the Commission
with the European court, accusing Brussels of failing to enforce EU rules on
free movement of people. Ecas yesterday threatened to open a second case.
Siemens and Bull, the German and French electronics groups, have been
working on the Schengen computer system for two years, but they have yet to
iron out all the software problems. Schengen experts will meet in Brussels
on January 25 to decide whether the February 1 deadline can be met. Ecas and
the parliament then want Brussels to take tough action to force Britain,
Denmark and Ireland to abolish their passport checks.
* Ecas, 1, rue Defacqz, 1050 Brussels, Belgium. Hotline (from February 1 to
February 7): (32 2) 534 4233
