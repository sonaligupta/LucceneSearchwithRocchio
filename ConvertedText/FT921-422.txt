FT  30 MAR 92 / Venezuela oil chief appointed


   By JOSEPH MANN


   CARACAS


VENEZUELAN President Carlos Andres Perez has appointed Mr Gustavo Roosen, a
prominent business executive and minister of education since 1989, as
president of the country's national oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela SA
(PDVSA).
Mr Roosen, 47, replaces Mr Andres Sosa Pietri, who resigned last week. In
his letter of resignation, Mr Sosa sharply criticised aspects of the
government's petroleum policy.
The appointment ended weeks of speculation over who would get the post,
which is of great importance in Venezuea. The company, which had gross sales
revenues of Dollars 22.3bn last year, provides the government with most of
its tax revenue and foreign exchange.
Mr Roosen, like Mr Sosa, comes from outside the industry. While he possesses
excellent managerial credentials, Mr Roosen's appointment represents a
rebuff to veteran oil industry executives who see their access to the
company's top job cut off by presidential decision.
