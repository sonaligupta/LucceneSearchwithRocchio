FT  16 JAN 92 / Manila agrees IMF terms


   By RICHARD GOURLAY


   MANILA


THE Philippines yesterday agreed terms with the International Monetary Fund
that should allow the resumption of a Dollars 900m (Pounds 503m) lending
programme suspended last July when Manila failed to meet economic targets,
writes Richard Gourlay in Manila.
Mr Jesus Estanislao, finance secretary, said the two sides had agreed on a
target for the central government's budget deficit which was the only
unresolved issue from last week's IMF mission. Resumption of the programme
is still dependent on the Philippines passing tougher revenue-raising
measures. Only then will the IMF give its stamp of 'good housekeeping' on
which a commercial bank debt rescheduling agreement and new international
aid commitments depend.
The measures have been passed by the House of Representatives but have yet
to be approved by the Senate.
