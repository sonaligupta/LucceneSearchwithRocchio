Mayr-Melnhof (MM), the family-controlled Austrian carton board and packaging
group, will raised about Sch3.2bn (Dollars 270m) through the planned
flotation of the shares.
About 4.4m shares will be offered to investors at Sch720 per share, leaving
the family with two thirds of the capital.
Three-quarters of the shares are expected to be placed internationally and
the rest in Austria. MM is the leading European producer of recycled carton
board, the second largest converter of folding cartons and holds a leading
position in the waste paper industry in Austria and Germany.
The proceeds from the issue will help finance acquisitions and further
expand the group's operations in Europe. MM has production facilities and
subsidiaries in Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, France, and Britain,
as well as in Austria.
The offer will be split between 4m ordinary shares, with another 400,000
shares reserved as options for the underwriters.
