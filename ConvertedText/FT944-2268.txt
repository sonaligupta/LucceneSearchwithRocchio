FT  16 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Warburg hit as talks fail


   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN


The bull case for SG Warburg sagged yesterday as the merchant bank announced
that its merger talks with Morgan Stanley, of the US, had foundered.
The sticking point in the deal was Mercury Asset Management, Warburg's 75
per cent-owned fund management arm. Morgan Stanley said Mercury shareholders
demanded too high a price and it was not prepared to take Warburg on its
own.
Many analysts were still looking confidently towards the next stage. They
believe Warburg has put up the 'For Sale' sign and expect other potential
buyers to appear. They added that with a hostile bid out of the question,
contenders will have to pay a premium price to buy off the recalcitrant MAM
shareholders, and Pounds 12 a share was still in sight. Others are more
cynical. One leading analyst said: 'I do not see anyone coming to buy
yesterday's merchant bank.'
The news that the deal was off came when many dealers were at lunch and sent
Warburg's share price spiralling downwards. The sudden shift of the price at
which dealers were prepared to offer stock prompted a sharp backwardation -
a situation where bid and offer prices are technically reversed. The shares
tumbled 80, bounced and then dropped back to close 99 off at 699p with 4.9m
traded. Mercury Asset Management retreated 67 to 678p.
The news took the shine off the other perceived bid targets within the
sector. Smith New Court lost 12 at 415p and Kleinwort Benson shed 22 to
519p.
Profit-taking in bid target Northern Electric gathered pace after the
Department of Trade and Industry emphasised that it would hold on to its
golden shares in UK utilities until March 1995.
Trafalgar House confirmed market speculation on Wednesday that it was
considering a bid for Northern. Analysts were not completely surprised by
the DTI announcement, but one said: 'This is just prolonging the
inevitable.'
Shares in Northern reversed Wednesday's strong rise and slipped 26 to 984p
in busy trade of 2.4m. The company also said it had requested a stock
exchange enquiry into the rise in its shares before Trafalgar stated its
intentions.
The view taken by some analysts is that there is better value elsewhere in
the sector. Mr Kevin Lapwood at Smith New Court was among those that back
such a view and he said: 'On a break-up value we would rate Northern at
1160p. But we value Norweb at 1280p, East Midlands at 1100p and South Wales
at 1250p.'
Norweb also suffered from profit-taking and retreated 9 to 791p, but East
Midlands jumped 29 to 798p and South Wales moved forward 7 1/2 to 834 1/2 p.
Other big moves included Manweb, up 24 at 855p, and Midlands, 32 higher at
836p.
Trafalgar, which advanced 1 1/2 to 73 1/2 p, was boosted by the release of
favourable full-year figures which saw the company turn a Pounds 347m loss
last year into a Pounds 45.6m profit this year. The group also ruled out a
rights issue should it decide to go ahead with a bid for Northern Electric.
Pharmaceuticals stocks received support in the US, with some feeling that
the sector will receive a fundamental rerating next year. There was some
technical London selling ahead of futures expiry in the UK but there was
specific interest in SmithKline Beecham, up a penny at 445p following a well
received presentation earlier in the week, and in Zeneca, perceived as a
possible bid candidate and which rose 6 to 858p. Wellcome, a penny off at
671p, has attracted steady takeover speculation but the shares were
restrained yesterday as the market reacted to a story in the US that was
critical of Aids drug combinations. Wellcome manufactures the leading Aids
treatment AZT, or Retrovir.
Positive clinical trial reports from Scotia Holdings on its cancer treatment
saw the shares forge ahead 21 to 274p.
Asda's strong interims helped to push the shares up  1/2 to 64p, but
turnover was relatively modest at 7m and the rest of the sector was mostly
easier. J. Sainsbury dipped 2 to 388p and Tesco shed 3 to 234p.
The results were comfortably ahead of City expectations and most securities
houses upgraded full-year profits forecasts, although reduced depreciation
accounted for most of the unforeseen gains.
BZW's full-year estimate was moved up by Pounds 15m to Pounds 230m, with the
investment bank taking a shine to like-for-like sales growth of 7 per cent
over the first 28 weeks of 1994-95.
Standard Chartered moved ahead 13 to 275p as various houses stressed their
positive views following news that the bank is to reduce costs through staff
cuts.
Abbey National improved a penny to 407p as James Capel published a buy
recommendation arguing that the former building society would benefit from a
lower cost base and increased market share.
Media conglomerate Pearson dropped 12 to 557p on unwinding of technical long
positions.
Yorkshire Television fell 7 to 373p on turnover of 3m, with investment fund
M&G believed to have contributed heavily to the selling.
Food manufacturers were a mixed bag. Unilever rose 13 to 1123p following a
buy recommendation from NatWest Securities, but Cadbury-Schweppes shed a
further 9 to 395p for a two-day decline of 14 as worries built up over the
possibility of soft drink demand looking sick against warm-weather inflated
1994 volumes.
News that AG Barr, number three in the soft drinks league, had gained the
take-home franchise for Orangina International helped to lift Barr 13 to
383p. Edible oils specialist Acatos & Hutcheson jumped 14 to 264p on the
back of strong prelims and an extra penny on the dividend.
A complex deal involving a steel mill disposal, an effective share buy-back,
a rights issue and a French acquisition led to heavy trading in ASW, which
closed 20 higher at 215p after 1.7m turnover.
Motor components group BSG International also met with big turnover.
Following boardroom moves and a meeting with analysts the shares rose 1 1/2
to 55 1/2 p in 7.1m traded.
Housebuilders managed a modest rebound, with Barratt Developments improving
6 to 151p in 1.6m turnover and Bryant adding 3 1/2 at 122p. The improving
sentiment was helped by a return to profit at YJ Lovell, which bounded ahead
by 12 per cent, adding 7 at 60p.
Among building materials issues, Blue Circle dipped 5 to 265p but Rugby
gained 3 1/2 at 106p. RMC slid 23 to 941p, although in each case trading
volume was nominal.
