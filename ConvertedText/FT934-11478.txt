FT  30 OCT 93 / Motoring: BMW, a touch special


   By STUART MARSHALL


THERE I was, convincing myself that the only things needed nowadays when
assessing a car were to check the price and look at its environmental,
safety, security and recyclability credentials before making a judgment.
Then, BMW (GB) spoilt it all by asking me to try its latest wares: a 325i
Convertible and M3 high-performance saloon, both with manual gears; and a
325tds turbo-diesel and 840Ci coupe, both automatics.
Never mind what the letters on their boot lids said; for me, they were all
SE models. SE, that is, not for special equipment but for sheer enjoyment.
What is it that makes a BMW - any BMW - a touch out of the ordinary to
drive? The company talks about the cars being an extension of the driver's
nervous system. It sounds a bit pretentious, but it must be near to the
truth because I do find myself striking up an instant rapport with a BMW.
There is an eagerness about a BMW, a desire to please a driver who enjoys
making a car go well without in any way wishing to behave like a hooligan.
The highway, after all, is public. It has to be shared with the less
fortunate driving ageing family hatchbacks. (Or, on the roads behind Nice
where I sampled the BMWs, the occasional out-of-season tourist in an
unwieldy camper van).
The 325i Convertible I tried first was a real south-of-France car. In late
October sunshine, with the top down, it was sufficiently draught-free for
short-sleeved autoroute driving to be a pleasure. With a strongly reinforced
body shell, it felt stiffer than many soft tops, flexing only slightly on
rough mountain roads.
The power-operated top disappears completely. Pop-up roll bars behind the
rear seats, and a massively strong windscreen surround, protect the
occupants' should the car overturn.
The price is Pounds 28,000 but this year's production is sold out. BMW (GB)
expects at least 500 Britons to buy one next year.
Next, a bright yellow M3, a two-door hard-top with a three-litre engine. The
top speed is said to be 160 mph (258 kmh). From 0-60mph (0-96 kmh) takes but
5.4 seconds and the average fuel consumption, should any owner really be
interested, is 31.5 mpg (8.96 l/100 km).
None of these claims can, realistically, be tested during an hour's drive on
mountain roads. What I can say is that the fat-tyred M3 was nervously
responsive to the slightest movement of the steering wheel; cornered with
total security at absurd speeds; and, in fifth gear, trickled through
villages slowly and so quietly enough that the boule players did not look
up. What more could a sporting driver with family responsibilities (and
Pounds 32,450) ask for?
Before going into diesels, BMW always maintained it was not prepared to
sacrifice refinement or performance. In other words, a BMW diesel would be a
BMW first, a diesel car second. Well, if you can afford it, the 325td (from
Pounds 18,950 list price) is the best medium-sized diesel for a mix of
performance and refinement. The 325tds, with an intercooler as well as a
turbocharger, raises the stakes higher still.
It has an extra 28 horsepower on tap (143 against 115); a higher maximum
speed (133 mph/214 kmh compared with 123 mph/198 kmh); and even a slightly
better average fuel consumption of 42.2 mpg/6.7 l/ 100 km (40.9 mpg/6.9
l/100 km).
The 325tds four-speed automatic I tried turned like a polo pony and sounded
ultra-refined. Only a distant chuckle under the bonnet at start-up gave the
game away. At Pounds 22,250, this is the car for the business motorist who
believes in cutting his consumption of fossil fuel but wants full enjoyment
from driving.
Finally, the 840Ci. When first I drove the original V12-engined 850Ci I was
slightly underwhelmed; the handling was not quite right. That was three
years ago and I am prepared to believe that much may have changed.
But my first experience of the 840Ci - essentially the same car, but with
the latest four-litre V8 and, in this case, a five-speed automatic
transmission - was different. It is a wide vehicle, but so sharp is its
handling that it seemed within minutes to have slimmed. As easy as a family
saloon to drive, it swept up and down curving D-roads with panache.
Standard features include traction control, air-conditioning and a
12-speaker stereo. BMW (GB) expects about 100 people to take delivery of a
Pounds 52,950 840Ci next year. If only I could be among them.
