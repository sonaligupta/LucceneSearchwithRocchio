FT  16 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: A better vision of Europe


   From LORD HASKEL


Sir, I am sure that many of your readers shared my surprise at the
hysterical tone of Mr Alan Sugar's attack on Mr John Smith after his
statement at the Congress of European Socialists (Letters, November 10). Mr
Sugar was obviously outraged that there should be any view on unemployment
in the European Union other than one which relates to his narrow personal
business interests. Certainly the views of Mr Sugar may prop up his share
price but the cost is paid by us all at the thousands of social services
offices throughout Europe where the the debris of unemployment is picked up.
Thankfully there are people like Mr Smith and his colleagues who have more
vision. They take the wider view that during this recession all of us in the
European Union should act together and make sacrifices to try to preserve
jobs because this is less wasteful of the investment in equipment and
training which has gone into those jobs. It also causes less human misery.
They hope that these jobs will flourish after the recession and, indeed,
have proposals for a fund to help their plan succeed.
This broader vision deserves serious consideration and will get it from the
majority of people who work in industry - perhaps even from some of Mr
Sugar's employees.
