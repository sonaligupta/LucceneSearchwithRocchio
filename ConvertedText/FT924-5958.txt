FT  24 NOV 92 / Observer: In camera


The members of the fearless BBC Panorama team who deal routinely with such
difficult subjects as cocaine and military supplies to Iraq are taking on a
really dangerous subject next week - their own future. Panorama plans to
investigate the future of its own employer, in the wake of today's
government discussion document, and has exclusive film footage of the Beeb
governors at work. It is understood that the behaviour of both governors and
senior management was exemplary when the cameras were switched on. But as
soon as they had clicked off, it was a different picture entirely. An
animated discussion ensued as to whether such a programme was a good idea.
No surprise that the argument split along predictable lines. Sir Michael
Checkland, the outgoing director general, who recently suggested his
chairman Marmaduke Hussey was a bit too old for a second term as chairman,
was firmly behind the idea. The Duke and the incoming director general John
Birt seemed less enamoured.
