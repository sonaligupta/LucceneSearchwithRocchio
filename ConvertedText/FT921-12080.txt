FT  29 JAN 92 / India's jute workers strike for more pay


   By KUNAL BOSE


   CALCUTTA


NEARLY 140,000 workers in 53 jute mills in West Bengal, India, went on
strike yesterday for more pay, writes Kunal Bose in Calcutta.
Trade unions have supported the strike but have exempted the five jute mills
owned by the government and a unit managed by a workers' co-operative.
The Indian Jute Mills Association (IJMA) said jute mill workers' wages
compared favourably with those prevailing in other industries.
It admitted that eight jute mills were paying substantially lower wages in
violation of a 1988 pay agreement. But these were not members of the IJMA.
The IJMA wanted rises tied to productivity.
