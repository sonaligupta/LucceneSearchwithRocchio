FT  05 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Emily Bronte would very likely have
approved of wind farms


   From Ms ANNE THOMPSON


Sir, Nigel Spivey in his article 'Bronte country can go with the wind'
(Arts: February 26/27) is right to send up the illustrious literary
environmentalists who wrote to the Times Literary Supplement on February 18
to call upon the government to ban further wind farms within a 20-mile
radius of Haworth.
It may be that there was no place to liberate Emily Bronte's mind quite like
the moorland round her home; but that does not mean we can expect to
liberate our own minds by returning there, still less by seeking to ensure
the skyline does not change. In any case, it appears from her poems that
Emily was more interested in the wind (the 'blast') than the skyline, and
nobody is suggesting the turbines damage wind.
It is possible that, if she had been living 150 years later, Emily would
have approved of the wind farms. Charlotte Gerin in her biography (Oxford
University Press, 1978) describes how the task of investing the legacies she
and her sisters received from their aunt in December 1842 fell to Emily, and
how that strong-minded person took shares for her sisters and herself in the
York and North Midland Railway Company, which had been started in 1839. It
would appear Emily Bronte was not afraid of innovations.
