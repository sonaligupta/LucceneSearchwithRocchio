FT  13 NOV 92 / International Company News: Restructuring helps Atlas Copco
to offset downturn

ATLAS Copco, Europe's largest air compressor manufacturer, lifted profits,
after financial items, to SKr751m (Dollars 125.9m) for the first nine months
of 1992, up 22 per cent on the same 1991 period.
Operating profit after depreciation rose 24 per cent to SKr914m. Sales rose
a more modest 6 per cent to SKr11.65bn, largely reflecting the acquisition
of AEG's electrical power tool operations at the start of the year.
Atlas Copco said it continued to suffer from recession in many of its main
markets and currency movements had also had a negative impact. But it noted
that it was now reaping the benefit of restructuring and investment carried
out in 1990 and 1991, which had enabled it to offset some of the effects of
the downturn.
The biggest turnround came in the construction and mining technique business
area, which posted a SKr128m profit in the nine months, compared with a
SKr47m loss.
Last year this division was responsible for the biggest share of an overall
SKr166m restructuring charge.
The Industrial Technique division, which now includes the AEG power tool
activities, saw earnings fall to SKr112m from SKr192m. The third major area
of operation, Compressor Technique, boosted earnings to SKr755m from
SKr749m.
The group expects its operations to be effected by continued weak demand for
the rest of the year, with recent currency movements having an additional
adverse impact.
Nevertheless, it still expects a better result than in 1991, when profits
after financial items amounted to SKr910m.
Stora Kopparbergs, the forest products group, has accepted a new offer from
holding company Industriforvaltnings AB Kinnevik for its shares in Korsnas.
Stora owns 15 per cent of the voting rights and 13 per cent of Korsnas'
capital.
