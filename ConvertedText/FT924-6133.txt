months

MISAWA Homes, the Japanese housing company, posted a 39 per cent fall in
first-half taxable profits due to the faltering domestic housing market.
Non-consolidated pre-tax profits for the six months to September fell to
Y6.4bn (Dollars 51.61m) from Y10.5bn a year earlier. Sales fell 14.7 per
cent to Y110.9bn and after-tax profits plunged 53.6 per cent to Y2.4bn. The
company was hit by a sharp fall in urban development projects, while
revenues from its golf course membership businesses also fell. Orders
received during the first six months slid 15.5 per cent to Y117.8bn.
For the year to March, Misawa expects parent sales to rise 1.4 per cent to
Y255bn and pre-tax profits to fall 29.5 per cent to Y13bn. It said profits
were likely to be hit by losses on the planned sale of land originally
earmarked for development.
Kumagai Gumi, the Japanese construction company, reported a 22.7 per cent
fall in unconsolidated pre-tax profits to Y12.1bn for the first half to
September, due to weak capital investment by corporations.
