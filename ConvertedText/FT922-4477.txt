FT  05 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Quiligotti sells US arm and calls for
Pounds 3.2m


   By JANE FULLER


QUILIGOTTI, the USM-quoted maker and installer of terrazzo floors, is
selling its loss-making US subsidiary and raising Pounds 3.2m in a rights
issue.
The new management, which bought into the company last September, also
warned that it had lost about Pounds 1.8m pre-tax in the year to March 31,
compared with a Pounds 910,000 profit in 1990-91. There would be no final
dividend. The interim was also passed.
Mr Roy Jenkins, chief executive, said: 'People worried about Quiligotti for
two reasons - America and high debt - and those two reasons have gone away.'
The US business, which incurred a trading loss of about Pounds 1.5m last
year, is being sold for Dollars 580,000 (Pounds 333,000) to JWB Capital
Group, of Texas. A near Pounds 3m write-off on the disposal will be treated
as an extraordinary item.
Mr Jenkins said that although the UK business made a trading profit of about
Pounds 700,000, the 1991-92 pre-tax loss had been pushed up to Pounds 1.8m
by more than Pounds 500,000 of provisions for old contracts, plus
rationalisation costs and interest payments.
The 3-for-2 rights issue at 8p a share would raise Pounds 3.2m and reduce
net debt of Pounds 4.5m. Gearing would come down from more than 100 per cent
to less than 50 per cent.
The group, which supplies flooring for supermarkets, airports and stations,
was developing new ceramic, marble and granite-based products to try to
increase its share of hard flooring markets.
