FT  29 OCT 93 / International Company News: Statoil rises to NKr2.9bn
despite weaker oil price

STATOIL, the Norwegian state oil company, yesterday reported a rise in
nine-month net profit to NKr2.9bn (Dollars 414m) from NKr2.4bn in the same
period last year, in spite of lower crude oil prices and a decline in crude
oil production.
The group forecast lower operating profits for the fourth quarter, on the
basis of oil prices, and warned of uncertainties over the balance of the oil
market and price trends, particularly for crude oil.
Nevertheless, its revenue rose by NKr2.2bn to NKr63.3bn in the first three
quarters of this year while operating profit remained unchanged at NKr9.9bn.
Statoil said Brent Blend reference crude secured an average price of Dollars
17.64 per barrel in the first nine months of this year, down from Dollars
19.36 for the same period last year. Crude oil availability fell to an
average 406m barrels a day in the first nine months of this year from an
average 416m last year.
The third quarter was affected by declining oil prices and continued low
prices for petrochemical products, but net profit increased to NKr1.1bn from
NKr592m as revenue rose slightly to NKr20.8bn.
For the group's individual business units, exploration and production lifted
nine-month operating profit by NKr600m to NKr7.2bn, helped by higher oil
prices in domestic currency terms - NKr124 a barrel versus NKr119 - and
lower operating costs.
The natural gas division suffered a decline of NKr500m in operating profit
to NKr2.4bn in the nine-month period, due to lower revenue from gas
transport operations.
Refining and marketing lifted operating profit by NKr200m to NKr772m, helped
by higher margins at the Mongstad refinery, improved operations and better
results from marine transport operations.
Petrochemicals and plastics saw operating losses increase by NKr127m to
NKr405m due to a charge of NKr196m against accounts to cover winding-up
costs of a major methytertiary butyl ether (MTBE) project which the group
shelved.
Statoil said that excluding the charge, the unit's result was improved by
better margins and lower costs.
