FT  23 APR 93 / Letter: Top pay awards reflect a system in need of change -
and a rising workload (2)


   From Mr J R ANDERSON


Sir, Your suggestion that the institutions should take a more active role in
questioning the increases in directors' salaries is praiseworthy but
unlikely to be fruitful. The essential problem is the incestuous nature of
the system. A sits on B's remuneration committee, B sits on C's, and C sits
on A's is a simplified, but reasonably accurate, description of the way in
which it works. And, of course, the boards of the institutions are
themselves part of this game of 'pass the parcel'.
The rules of the club are well understood:
All downwaves are the fault of government's mismanagement of the economy;
Upwaves are, by contrast, solely attributable to the acumen of the
directors;
Any director who, by his incompetence, reduces a company to its knees is
entitled to walk away from the disaster carrying a large bag of gold: Any
shareholder querying the amount of an increase in remuneration must be told
that it is essential if the director is not to take his talents overseas.
The fact that during the long years of punitive taxation there was not the
slightest evidence that overseas companies had any interest in securing the
services of UK executives is to be dismissed as irrelevant.
