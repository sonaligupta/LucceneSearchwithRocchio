FT  14 APR 94 / International Company News: Seagram stake in Time Warner up


   By MARTIN DICKSON


   NEW YORK


Seagram, the Canadian drinks group, has raised its stake in Time Warner to
14.2 per cent from 13.1 per cent, writes Martin Dickson in New York.
The moves takes Seagram close to its announced target of a 15 per cent
holding in the world's largest entertainment group. Seagram has denied
hostile intentions, but rumours persist it might bid for Time Warner, which
has put in place an anti-takeover 'poison pill'.
