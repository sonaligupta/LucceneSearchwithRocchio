FT  25 MAR 92 / International Company News: Microsoft to buy Fox Software
for Dollars 175m

   SAN FRANCISCO


MICROSOFT, the world's largest maker of personal computer software, is to
acquire Fox Software, a private developer of database programs for desktop
computers, for 1.36m Microsoft shares. The deal is worth about Dollars 175m.
Fox, based in Perrysburg, Ohio, specialises in database software, used to
organise libraries of data and retrieve information.
The acquisition heralds Microsoft's entry into the database management
software field, one of the few categories of desktop computer software in
which it does not compete. It has been developing its own database programs,
but has yet to launch any products.
With its acquisition of Fox and entry into the database program market,
Microsoft will compete with Borland International, the leading maker of
database software for personal computers.
Borland's stock price fell sharply on news of the Microsoft deal. After a
Monday close of Dollars 70.25, it traded at Dollars 64 at midday yesterday.
Microsoft's stock remained relatively steady, fluctuating between Dollars
128.75 and Dollars 129.87
Microsoft will combine its own development team with the Fox group at
Microsoft's headquarters near Seattle, Washington.
'Our intention is to combine expertise and provide users with a family of
complementary products, ' said Mr Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman and chief
executive.
Among these offerings will be Microsoft's in-house developed database
program, code-named Cirrus, for personal computers that run Microsoft's
Windows operating system.
Mr Gates said: 'We soon will be able to offer customers a complete family of
superior scalable database applications and development environments.' Mr
David Fulton, Fox's president, will join Microsoft to head its
recently-created database software division.
