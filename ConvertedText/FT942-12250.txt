FT  30 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Deregulation proposal a threat to
many local authority markets


   From Mr J S WHITAKER


Sir, Despite a large number of objections, the government is forcing through
a bill which threatens the future of local authority-owned markets. The
Deregulation and Contracting Out Bill will remove common law protection for
markets built on common law and provided by market rights. Rights of markets
in private ownership will not be removed.
The government received 2,322 responses to the bill. Of these 2,049 objected
to the market deregulation proposal.
One of the reasons given in replies from ministers at the Department of
Trade and Industry is that there are 'waiting lists of potential stall
holders' for market stalls. This statement is an indication that ministers
have not visited the markets before proposing legislation which could have
serious effects on the future of markets, particularly those in small market
towns.
In my authority between 2 and 70 per cent of stalls are empty each market
day, and on speaking to colleagues throughout England and Wales the pattern
of empty stalls is very similar. This failure by ministers to visit markets
is in stark contrast to visits by transport minister, Mr Steven Norris, to
towns and cities regarding the review of taxi licensing. He is experiencing
at first hand the views of the trade, public and local authorities.
I ask every MP and member of the House of Lords to visit the markets in
their constituencies on market days and see for themselves the present
situation, and judge whether the city and town centres can afford the rush
of new markets and car boot sales which will appear when the floodgates of
deregulation are opened.
