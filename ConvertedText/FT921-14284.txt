FT  16 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Pressure on margins as Wyko dives to Pounds
279,000


   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent


SHARP AND sustained pressure on margins led to a collapse in interim profits
at Wyko, the West Midlands-based manufacturer and distributor of bearings
and power transmission components.
Pre-tax profits of Pounds 279,000 for the six months to October 31 were 80
per cent lower than the corresponding period's Pounds 1.42m. This translated
into a fall in earnings per share from 3.8p to 0.66p.
But the group is maintaining its interim dividend at 1.4p despite having to
dip into reserves to meet the full cost. Mr Philip White, chairman,
explained that the move was a sign of confidence.
'We feel we possibly have seen the worst of it now. The thing has bottomed.
We've seen some slight signs of improvement here and there,' he said.
The figures were indeed better than in the second half of 1990-91 when
pre-tax profits of just Pounds 101,000 were recorded. The problem has been
the pressure on margins. First half turnover of Pounds 25.4m was only
fractionally down from that in the corresponding period; operating profits,
however, fell from Pounds 2.01m to Pounds 853,000.
During the second half Mr White is expecting a better performance from UK
manufacturing activities. There is, he noted, 'a reasonable order book,' but
the main hope of higher second half earnings comes from the UK distribution
network where the group will have a full six month contribution from EW
Bearings' outlets, acquired last October.
Recently there have been signs that prices and margins were stabilising in
the international distribution business, although general trading conditions
remain unsettled.
Gearing, now running at 50 per cent, is expected to be under 40 per cent by
the end of the year despite capital expenditure of Pounds 1.3m.
