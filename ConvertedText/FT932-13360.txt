FT  23 APR 93 / UK Company News: Aberdeen Petroleum threatens liquidation


DIRECTORS of Aberdeen Petroleum yesterday threatened to liquidate the
company and distribute proceeds to shareholders if they failed to secure a
higher bid than the current offer from Pittencrieff.
USM-quoted Aberdeen said it had received proposals, subject to contract, to
purchase all of its oil and gas assets.
Responding to the offer document from the acquisitive natural resources and
communications company, Mr David Hooker, Aberdeen managing director, said:
'The offer is cheap and Pittencrieff clearly must reconsider its position.
We shall continue to solicit a superior offer.'
He thought liquidation would give shareholders cash of more than 18p per
share. The 15.2p per share offer from Pittencrieff did not fairly value its
assets, which Aberdeen said had a realisable value above 20p per share.
Pittencrieff holds 26.6 per cent of its target, shares in which closed
unchanged at 15 3/4 p. Pittencrieff shares were unchanged at 373p.
