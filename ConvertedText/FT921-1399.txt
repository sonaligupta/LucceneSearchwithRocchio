FT  24 MAR 92 / FT Conference: EC rules attacked


   By JOHN THORNHILL


THE HEAD of Europe's third-biggest packaging company yesterday launched a
fierce attack on the main thrust of European environmental legislation that
affects his industry.
Mr Hans Rausing, chairman and chief executive of Tetra Pak Alfa-Laval Group
of Sweden, said at a Financial Times conference in London on packaging and
the environment that the attention paid to waste from packaging was
disproportionate to its impact on the environment.
He said household packaging waste constituted less than 2.5 per cent of the
total waste generated by society.
Mr Clemens Stroetmann, state secretary in the German environment ministry,
defended the German approach which was based on the 'polluter pays'
principle. He said the recycling system being created by German industry was
already proving a 'clear success'.
However, Mr Jonathan Sims, a consultant with RMA, the packaging consultants,
told the conference: 'More resources are being spent transporting waste
packaging around Germany, sorting it, recycling it, warehousing it and
dumping it on other markets than are being saved.' Repeating the process on
a European scale would lead to 'environmental vandalism' masquerading as
environmental benefit.
