FT  19 MAY 92 / Letter: Public sector stimulus and elimination of private
sector distortions would help meet need for affordable houses (4)


   From Mr RICHARD MCMANUS


Sir, Reapportioning subsidy from owner occupiers to tenants is not the only
way to widen choice in the housing market ('More housing choice needed', May
13).
Government could help prospective tenants select from a glut of vacant
properties by establishing a computerised 'clearing house'. This would
maximise choice by liaising with existing letting agents and estate agents.
Government would endorse the rental alternative, which has a bad name in
Britain, without compromising free market principles or robbing loyal
supporters.
In the longer term, institutional investors may be attracted to fund a
private rental resurgence without additional tax subsidy; they would have
evidence of the volume and location of rental demand and the net yields
achievable.
