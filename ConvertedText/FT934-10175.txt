FT  06 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Barclaycard's credit facility - At a
glance


Barclaycard has launched a facility designed to enable customers to exceed
their credit card limit. Barclaycard Reserve gives customers a cheque book
which can be used in places which do not accept credit cards. It also
provides an additional credit facility of between Pounds 1,000-Pounds 3,000.
Interest will be charged at the same rate as Barclaycard - 21.6 per cent APR
 -and there will be no annual charge. Customers must make a minimum monthly
repayment of Pounds 25 or four per cent of the outstanding balance,
whichever is the greater. The new service will only be available to
creditworthy customers.
