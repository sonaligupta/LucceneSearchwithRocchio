FT  02 NOV 93 / International Company News: Challenge Bank back in black


   By NIKKI TAIT


CHALLENGE Bank, the Perth-based regional bank which acquired the retail
banking assets and liabilities for NatWest Australia in South Australia and
Western Australia in June, yesterday reported a ADollars 21.4m (USDollars
14.3m) after-tax profit in the year to end-September.
The figure compares with a loss of ADollars 43.2m in the previous year.
Challenge said non-performing loans fell from ADollars 68m to ADollars 53m
during the year. Lending increased to ADollars 1.45bn, including ADollars
1.04bn for owner-occupier and investment housing.
Total assets rose by 25 per cent to ADollars 4.2bn.
The banking group said it believed there were 'consistent signs that
Australia is emerging from recession'. It said Western Australia looked
'particularly promising'.
In September, the company announced a ADollars 67.5m convertible note issue,
by way of rights to existing shareholders, and a non-underwritten placement
of up to ADollars 15m.
Yesterday, it said that the full placement was likely to be made, and that
the capital raised should increase the bank's risk-weighted capital ratio to
about 12 per cent.
