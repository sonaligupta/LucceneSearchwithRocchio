FT  20 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: No nasty surprises at the opera


   From Mr PETER SACHS


Sir, The problem with the English National Opera ('Contrasting fortunes at
the opera', April 19) is that productions have in the past decade become
'unreliable', while the musical performance has remained consistently high.
For many years l was told that my taste was too old-fashioned, but the
abysmal 56 per cent attendance record now shows that I was not alone in
wanting realistic productions.
I have written to its director, Mr Dennis Marks, with a solution: tell
potential audiences exactly what sort of production they are going to see,
so they will not be in for a nasty surprise. That way some confidence may be
restored. The seat price reductions are probably less significant.
Peter Sachs,
Tanglewood, Manor Road,
