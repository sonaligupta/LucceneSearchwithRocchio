FT  22 OCT 92 / Aer Lingus set for deep cuts in network

AER LINGUS, the Irish state-run national airline, is poised to make
substantial cuts in its route network in an effort to stem mounting losses -
currently running at IPounds 40m (Pounds 43.4m) per year.
The company confirmed yesterday that 'an intense review of operations is
underway', but refused to comment on local media reports that the cuts could
result in more than 1,000 redundancies from its 6,500 workforce.
A board meeting today is to hear a report on the review, which is thought to
be near completion, but no decision is expected until the next board meeting
in November.
Aer Lingus recently suspended services to Paris and Amsterdam via
Manchester, as well as its Dublin-Gatwick route.
Mr Ray Burke, a former industry minister, and prominent backbencher in the
ruling Fianna Fail party, yesterday called for a cash injection from the
government.
The company's air transport operations have been in the red since 1988.
Losses rose to IPounds 19m in 1989-90, and deepened to IPounds 42.5m in
1990-91 in the wake of the Gulf war and recession.
Cost-cutting exercises shaved losses to IPounds 37.9m for the financial year
to March 31 1992, but analysts predict a renewed deterioration to IPounds
40m for the current year.
There is growing realisation within Aer Lingus that a new capital injection
would not resolve the problems without substantial restructuring.
The company suffered a setback in June when the GPA aircraft leasing group
aborted its flotation. Aer Lingus had hoped to raise up to Dollars 45m
(Pounds 26.1m) in selling part of its 20m shareholding.
The Dublin-Heathrow route, one of Aer Lingus's principal sources of income,
has experienced intense price competition since UK-Ireland services were
liberalised in 1985. British Airways decided to withdraw services to Ireland
in January 1991 because of losses.
One glimmer of hope is if the government drops the 'Shannon stop-over'
obligation on all transatlantic flights in and out of Ireland. Aer Lingus
said it was unable to open new routes from Dublin to the US West Coast as
long as there was an obligatory Shannon stopover.
