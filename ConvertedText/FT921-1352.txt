FT  25 MAR 92 / International Company News: Polish bank increases capital
fourfold

   WARSAW


BANK IG, one of Poland's larger private banks, has reported a fourfold
increase on its original 57.1bn zloyts capital and reserve funds following
the sale of new shares plus a bonus issue.
Bank IG has also retained Coopers and Lybrand Deloitte, the international
accountancy firm, as advisers on the possible sale of 25 per cent of the
bank to a foreign bank.
The capital increase brings Bank IG's capital adequacy ratio to 7 per cent,
according to Mr Boguslaw Kott, the bank chairman. This is in line with
changes in banking laws to be implemented soon which require Polish domestic
banks to achieve a 6 per cent ratio by the end of this year.
Of the capital and reserves increase, 42.5bn zloyts comes from a scrip issue
after shareholders agreed last December to take new shares in place of an
interim dividend for the first nine months.
A further 131.4bn zloyts came from shares placed mainly with existing
investors such as Warta and PZU, the state-owned insurance companies.
PZM, a large Polish shipping company based in Szczecin which has taken a 9.6
per cent share in Bank IG, is also a new shareholder.
Bank IG reported a 23.3bn zloyts (Dollars 1.7m) net profit in 1990 while the
first nine months of last year saw net profits reach 61.2bn zloyts.
The bank has also applied to Poland's Securities Commission for permission
to be listed on Warsaw's fledgling stock exchange. If successful, Bank IG
would be the first bank to appear alongside the 11 companies whose shares
are traded twice a week on the exchange.
Aachener und Munchener (AMB), the German financial holding company, said it
has agreed with French bank Credit Lyonnais to begin talks on Credit
Lyonnais taking a stake in AMB's banking unit, BfG Bank, Reuter reports.
