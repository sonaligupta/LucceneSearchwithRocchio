FT  23 APR 93 / International Company News: Z-Landerbank struggles to
Sch508m


   By IAN RODGER


Z-LANDERBANK Bank Austria eked out a net income of Sch508m (Dollars 45m)
last year, but only after extraordinary gains on asset sales covered bad
debt provisions of Sch6.3bn.
However, in its first full year of operations since the merger of the
Zentralsparkasse group of Viennese savings banks and Osterreichische
Landerbank in the autumn of 1991, Austria's largest bank made considerable
progress towards cutting costs and improving margins.
Net interest income rose 3.5 per cent to Sch10.9bn, as the bank benefited
from falling interest rates and, later in the year, greater spreads.
Commissions were up 9.3 per cent to Sch2.5bn.
Operating profit was up 1.2 per cent to Sch3.4bn and bank officials
indicated that nearly half came in the fourth quarter.
Total assets grew 5.8 per cent to Sch544.9bn. Capital rose 9.2 per cent to
Sch27.8bn, providing a BIS ratio of 9.3 per cent.
The directors are recommending that the dividend for 1992 be cut from 14 per
cent to 10 per cent.
Creditanstalt Bankverein, Austria's second-largest bank, said its pre-tax
profit surged 46 per cent in the first quarter to Sch1.15bn, due mainly to
booming securities trading.
