FT  24 NOV 92 / SA lures back investors


   By MICHAEL HOLMAN


DISINVESTMENT from South Africa has been reversed over the past year,
according to the Investor Responsibility Research Centre (IRRC), an
independent Washington-based research institute, writes Michael Holman.
According to the 1992 edition of the IRRC publication, International
Business in South Africa, 508 non-US companies have direct investment or
employees in South Africa, up from 454 a year ago. Of these, 153 are
British, 142 German and 111 are American.
US companies are also returning to South Africa, but in much smaller
numbers, says the report. Since President George Bush lifted the ban on new
investment in July 1991, five US companies have established offices,
bringing the total of US companies with direct investment or employees up to
111.
US disinvestment from South Africa began on a substantial scale after the
violence of the mid-1980s, with the number of US companies in the republic
falling from 267 in May 1986 to 168 by October 1987 to a low of 106 in 1991,
according to IRRC statistics.
But the report notes that US companies remain reluctant to invest in South
Africa 'because of more than 60 state, city and county selective contracting
laws that penalise companies doing business in South Africa when awarding
contracts'. Investors are also discouraged by violence and political
uncertainty, the report adds.
The trend towards establishing non-equity links with South African companies
'has continued to increase dramatically', the report continues.
It says that 303 non-US companies have non-equity links (such as licensing
or distribution agreements) with South African companies, a net increase of
132 from a year ago. US companies with non-equity links rose by 23 to 256.
