FT  12 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Review Panel clears Oceana


   By ANDREW JACK


Oceana, the South African-controlled investment company, has been cleared by
the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the UK accounts watchdog, over the way
it shows profits from Etam in its annual accounts.
But the action did nothing to reduce the feud between Oceana and Etam, the
fashion retailer for which it made an unsuccessful hostile bid last year.
Oceana was left with a 34.4 per cent stake in Etam, and has used equity
accounting in its accounts, which allowed it to show 34.4 per cent of the
company's profits as its own.
Equity accounting requires a shareholder to have 'significant influence'
over the company in which it has a holding. Etam says Oceana has no such
power, and complained to the Review Panel. Oceana has no board members or
co-operation agreements with Etam, and can only block special resolutions at
an annual meeting.
