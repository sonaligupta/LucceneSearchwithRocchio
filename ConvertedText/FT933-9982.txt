FT  06 AUG 93 / Letter: Buba was perhaps in the right


   From Mr THOMAS MARTINI


Sir, May I suggest that you fundamentally underestimated the wisdom and
skill of the Bundesbank in the recent ERM turmoil?
According to your headlines and comments in the last few days, (mainly
London-based) economists, analysts and foreign exchange dealers have
repeatedly been taken by surprise by several Buba decisions. When dealers
can no longer take bets with winnings guaranteed, what better proof is there
than that the German central bank has successfully burst the speculative
bubble?
The French franc has not been devalued, nor should or will it be in the
medium term as French fundamentals look somewhat better than those in
Germany - so the second goal is about to be achieved. And the Paris-Bonn
axis has been strengthened.
Finally, the UK and some other countries have been given enough room again
to participate in the European process if they so wish. The third goal is
achieved - Cunctator Major or his successor can no longer shelter behind
allegedly irresponsible German monetary policy, but will have to make his
own strategic political decisions on the UK's place in Europe.
