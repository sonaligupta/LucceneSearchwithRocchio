FT  16 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Kat-Parts


A Financial Times article published on March 14, 1991 was the subject of a
court statement yesterday. Mr Noel McMichael, solicitor for Kat-Parts Inc,
told Mr Justice Drake in the High Court in London that the article, headed
'Moles unearth spare parts scam' concerned the efforts of Caterpillar Inc,
by the use of private investigators, to eliminate a counterfeiting network.
He said the article, which was substantially based on information provided
to the FT by Caterpillar, accepted that Kat-Parts had been identified as
part of a counterfeiting network which was costing it several million US
dollars a year and enabling Mr William Dann, the head of Kat-Parts, to fund
an extravagant lifestyle. The FT now accepted that it should not have
portrayed this and other matters as proven fact.
The newspaper's solicitor, Mr Richard Shillito, agreed that the FT wished to
make clear that while Caterpillar had brought an action against Kat-Parts in
the US District Court for the southern district of Texas, Houston, in which
allegations of dealing in counterfeit parts are made against them, Kat-Parts
are vigorously defending the proceedings. The issues are yet to be
determined in the action.
In the meantime, he agreed, Kat-Parts is not restrained from dealing in
Caterpillar spare parts nor, as a result of the denial of an application by
Caterpillar in the US proceedings which was heard on May 9, 1991, is it
restrained from trading under the name Kat-Parts Inc.
Kat-Parts had assured the FT that spare parts which it agreed to supply to
Caterpillar's agents were all manufactured or supplied by companies which
were authorised Caterpillar sub-contractors. Kat-Parts had also assured the
FT that it does not employ a team of immigrant workers and that Mr Dann does
not have a luxury trailer on the Kat-Parts site in Houston, nor a house in
France and does not lead an extravagant lifestyle, the solicitor said.
