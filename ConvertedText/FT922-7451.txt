FT  19 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Footwear quotas 'could raise EC trainer
costs'


   By ANDREW HILL


   BRUSSELS


CONTROVERSIAL proposals to impose an EC-wide quota on imports of cheap
Chinese footwear could increase the cost of trainers for EC consumers,
according to manufacturers.
Trade officials from the 12 member states yesterday discussed a Commission
proposal for EC quotas in different categories of shoes, including the
growing market for trainers.
They broke up without agreement, with a majority said to favour the quota
proposal. Britain, Germany and the Netherlands asked the Commission to
supply further economic justification for the measure for their meeting this
week.
Chinese officials are in Brussels to discuss the proposals. China might
suggest a voluntary agreement to restrain exports, but Brussels does not
seem to favour such deals.
According to the Commission, Chinese footwear imports doubled between 1990
and 1991, from a large base. 'If they carried on at that rate there would be
no EC industry in five years,' a Commission official said yesterday.
But sports shoe companies such as Nike and Reebok contest the legality of
the Commission proposal, claiming it is too widely drawn. They are also
irritated they have been given little time to respond. Many EC imports of
popular brands of trainer are made in the Far East, with a growing share
coming from Chinese factories. In Reebok's case, the factories are built and
run by the Taiwanese in China. Reebok claims import quotas will increase the
price of trainers.
Instead of abolishing quotas altogether, the Commission decided to press for
harmonised Community quotas in specific areas, assessed according to the
value of imports. Quotas will be abolished in other markets, such as beach
shoes and waterproof footwear.
The Commission will meet Chinese officials this week.
