FT  07 JAN 94 / More evidence of consumption rise


Further evidence of buoyant consumer spending in the Christmas period came
yesterday when the Bank of England announced that the level of bank notes in
circulation in the week to January 5 was 8.6 per cent higher than the same
week last year.
The figure was higher than market expectations and followed a sharper than
expected December rise in M0, the narrowest money supply measure.
