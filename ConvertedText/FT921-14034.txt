FT  17 JAN 92 / Nissan flexes more of its muscle: Increased UK capacity will
be good for domestic components suppliers


   By JOHN GRIFFITHS


Nissan has set alarm bells ringing in the boardrooms of indigenous European
car manufacturers. Its announcement today that it would increase its car
production capacity in the UK by more than a third is bound to increase
Continental anxiety about the Japanese penetration of an already fiercely
competitive European car market. From producing just a handful of cars in
1986 when it opened its plant in Sunderland, in north-east England, Nissan
will be able to produce 300,000 cars annually from next year.
Overnight, French and Italian car makers have been forcefully reminded of
Peugeot chairman Jacques Calvet's portrayal of 'transplants' in the UK as 'a
Japanese aircraft carrier off the coast of Europe'. Traditionally protected
by their governments from Japanese imports, the French and Italians have
most to fear from increased production of Japanese cars classified as
European because they are built in the UK.
Nissan's latest expansion lifts official combined capacity projections for
Nissan, Toyota and Honda plants in the UK to 700,000 units within the next
five years. This will represent about 6 per cent of the European car market.
Since Toyota and Honda - the only other Japanese transplants in the UK  - do
not even start producing cars at their plants at Derby and Swindon
respectively until the end of this year, developments at Nissan are likely
to be viewed as a precedent for faster-than-expected expansion at Toyota and
Honda as well.
If expectation becomes reality, little additional production would be needed
to make nonsense of the EC Commission's 'working assumption' that Japanese
manufacturers will be producing 'only' 1.2m cars and light commercial
vehicles in the single market in Europe by the end of the decade.
UK government officials are already privately calculating that the figure is
likely to be much closer to 2m, with 1m in the UK alone by that time. That
being so, Nissan's announcement appears set to spark a new round of debate
about Japanese penetration of Europe's car market, and the role to be played
by the transplants within it.
What Nissan's expansion plans do indicate is that European consumers are
more than willing to buy the Japanese products now coming on offer.
According to Mr Ian Gibson, the former Ford executive who is managing
director of Nissan Motor Manufacturing (UK), Nissan had been 'well on the
conservative side in estimating how fast we could grow a customer base in
Europe'.
This was partly because of the big difference in the reception given on the
Continent to the one type of car being made in Sunderland - the Primera -
compared with its boxy predecessor, the Bluebird.
In its final year of production 40,000 Bluebirds were sold on the Continent.
Last year, the more sophisticated Primera found 112,000 Continental buyers,
and Mr Gibson says it has not been possible wholly to meet demand.
Significantly, 40,000 of the sales were to Germany, one of Europe's most
discriminating markets. Later this year, Nissan will start building a second
model, the Micra, which it believes will be as popular as the Primera.
The hostility of some Continental car makers notwithstanding, Nissan's
expansion is likely to give considerable satisfaction to European, and
particularly British, component makers, whose parts can account for up to 70
per cent of the vehicle's content.
Purchases from European and British suppliers will jump from Pounds 600m
last year to Pounds 850m in 1993, according to Mr Gibson.
The UK-based components industry's share of what Nissan will spend for parts
is set to jump by one half from Pounds 420m last year to Pounds 655m next
year. Its share of the spending will rise from 70 to 77 per cent. This added
business will help the components sector to offset reduced volume elsewhere
as a result of the UK car market collapse, Mr Gibson says.
The larger share is partly due to extra suppliers being recruited for the
Micra.
But part, too, is extra business for Continental European components groups
such as Bosch of Germany and Sommer and Raydell of France. These  -
surmising that the UK-based motor industry is not only going to produce many
more cars but be raised to Japanese standards of competitiveness - want to
be on the UK production bandwagon as it starts to roll in earnest.
Bosch, with its Pounds 100m alternator plant in South Wales, provides one
example. Sommer which supplies trim is another. It is actually setting up
shop on a site adjoining the Sunderland plant.
The biggest beneficiaries, however, are the 122 UK companies which have been
supplying Nissan from the start or who have joined as the Primera developed.
'Anyone supplying for the Primera has been a natural choice for supplying
Micra parts as well,' says Mr Gibson. Only about a dozen suppliers, unable
to meet or sustain Nissan's performance criteria have fallen by the wayside.
In north-east England, an area which until Nissan arrived had no motor
industry, the number of suppliers has grown from three when Nissan first set
up to 22. By next year, there will be 26. Spending with these will double
Pounds 280m.
The UK, however, is unlikely to be the principal beneficiary of the Pounds
150m investment in plant and equipment for the needed capacity expansion,
which includes more body pressing facilities and a greatly expanded engine
production facility. With relatively little left of the UK machine tool
industry, much will come from Germany and Japan.
The predominance of European suppliers appears to vindicate Japanese
contentions that there is no prospect of a march on Europe by Japanese
component suppliers of the type which has caused so much disruption to the
North American industry.
The history of Nissan UK's development so far is a compliment to the UK
components industry in particular, says Mr Gibson, who throughout his long
career with Ford - not least in setting up its often-troubled Halewood plant
on Merseyside - has acquired plenty of experience of the parts industry.
The development of Nissan's relationship with the UK components industry has
been a long and occasionally painful business. It has dawned only gradually
on some suppliers that they were expected to design and develop their own
components for Nissan cars - albeit to a comprehensive brief. This gave them
more autonomy than they were accustomed to in the normal, frequently
adversarial relationships with European car makers.
The fact that they have, or are fast acquiring, strong research and
development capabilities makes feasible Nissan's declared intention to
conceive, design and develop cars in Europe for European consumers, says Mr
Gibson.
'What has been really impressive though is the extent to which UK component
makers have been working with us as an opportunity to leapfrog their
continental competition.'
So far, says Mr Gibson, the inroads made by UK-built Nissans in the UK have
been made at the expense not of indigenous manufacturers but of other,
mainly Continental importers.
Ford, the UK market leader, has lost sales, but many industry observers
share Nissan's opinion that Ford's problems are self-inflicted. While
Nissan's output has been rising, Rover, Vauxhall and Peugeot Talbot have
also increased their share of the UK market. Mr Gibson, therefore, appears
right in his contention that it is mainly Continental imports which are
suffering.
With some 189,000 UK-built Nissans due to be shipped across the Channel next
year, that is not a message Peugeot's Mr Calvet or Fiat's Gianni Agnelli
will want to hear.
