FT  11 APR 94 / UK Company News: Companies slightly more optimistic


   By DAVID WIGHTON


Britain's small and medium-sized businesses are only slightly more
optimistic about their prospects than they were six months ago, but there
has been a big improvement in confidence in Spain, according to a survey by
3i and Cranfield School of Management.
Expectations have also improved in France, where sentiment mirrors that seen
in the UK a year ago. According to the survey, this suggests that French
companies can expect their economy to strengthen in the second half of 1994.
There has been some improvement in German confidence over the past six
months, but most companies remain pessimistic about prospects.
In the UK there has been a 50 per cent rise in companies seeking external
finance.
