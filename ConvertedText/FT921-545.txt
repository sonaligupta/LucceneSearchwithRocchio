FT  28 MAR 92 / Finance & The Family (At A Glance): Trust sales exceed
purchases


Investors sold more unit trusts than they bought in February, with sales
exceeding purchases by Pounds 30m. Gross sales for the month, at Pounds
569.6m, were less than half the figure for the same month last year. The
Unit Trust Association blamed election uncertainty for the lack of investor
interest.
The five year performance record of unit trusts also looks poor, and will
continue to do so until the stock market crash of 1987 drops out of the
statistics in November this year.
