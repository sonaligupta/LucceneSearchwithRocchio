FT  16 JAN 92 / The Lloyd's Report - Analysis: Changes are intended to
spread risks and rewards - Pooling by agents


   By RICHARD LAPPER


AMONG the least expected of the task force's recommendations is the
setting-up of members' agents pooling arrangements, or Mapas, to allow
agents to pool all the syndicate participations of the Names whose affairs
they handle, to spread risks and rewards more evenly, Richard Lapper writes.
The agent would pool all portfolios and allocate units in the pool to Names,
constructing a kind of unit trust, as distinct from a separate portfolio of
participations on separate syndicates for each Name.
The idea was mooted in the summer of 1990, but after extensive discussion in
the market the Lloyd's council took the decision at the beginning of last
year not to introduce it.
The task force says that was 'an unfortunate decision' and - given the
market's troubles - 'there would now be much more interest in this scheme'.
In particular, it says, a large slice of the market's losses in 1988 were
heavily concentrated among a minority of Names. 'The extreme losses of a few
Names bring not only great hardship to those Names but also considerable
damage to the reputation of the society as a whole.'
The introduction during the past year of new techniques to streamline
managing agent accounting - known as managing agent unitised accounting
(Manuac) - would make the introduction of Mapas easier and simpler. Such
techniques eliminate 'the need for managing agents to prepare syndicate
accounts for each Name.'
Under Manuac, the managing agent will declare an overall result for the
syndicate and distribute a payment to each members' agent pro rata.
The task force suggests that savings, perhaps up to Pounds 12m a year, can
be realised by the introduction of Mapas.
