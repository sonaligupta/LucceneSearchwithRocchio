FT  19 APR 94 / Warning on Russian N-plants

   ST PETERSBURG


Russia does not have the technical or financial capacity to process the
nuclear waste produced by its 15 Chernobyl-style reactors, Mr Yuri
Vishnevsky, president of the state committee for the supervision of nuclear
and radiation safety, said yesterday. Mr Viktor Gubanov, head of the
committee for safety and ecology at the ministry for atomic energy, said
Russia was finalising a federal programme to process nuclear waste but cash
shortages could prevent the programme being implemented in full. Mr Gubanov
said the ministry was ready to pay Rbs520m towards the project but it would
actually cost five or six times that.
