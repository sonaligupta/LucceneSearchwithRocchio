FT  08 NOV 94 / International Company News: Telecom Italia - Correction


In the FT survey on Italian Industry and Technology, published on October
25, the article on the telecoms sector stated that 60 per cent of Telecom
Italia's investment was financed by debt, and 40 per cent from internal
resources. The company points out that those figures refer to the coverage
of capital invested as at December 31 1993, before the merger of state-owned
telecoms companies, and not to annual investment, which is financed entirely
from internal resources. In 1994, Telecom Italia expects capital expenditure
to be more than covered by cash-flow.
The annual turnover of the company in the 1993 pro forma profit and loss
account was approximately L27,000bn (Dollars 17.27bn) and not L2,700bn, as
incorrectly reported.
