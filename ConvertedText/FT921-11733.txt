FT  30 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading


DEALERS OF stock index futures reported a dull session yesterday, with no
follow- through on the strong buying which occurred in the last few minutes
of Monday's trading.
A strong opening had been expected for the March contract following Monday's
late squeeze and the firm overnight performance on Wall Street. However,
there was little in the way of buying interest and sellers sent March
drifting lower. The poor Wall Street opening sent the contract to 2,562, the
low of the day, although a recovery was seen late in the session as Walls
Street bounced.
March closed at 2,578, down 16 from Tuesday and around 16 above its
estimated fair value premium of 16. Turnover was only 5,176 contracts.
The traded options market also experienced a dull session with turnover
reaching only 22,820, down from Monday's 28,724. The FT-SE 100 option traded
4,018. Dealers expected a higher total ahead of its January expiry this
week.
Tesco was the busiest stock option following a late spate of trading. It
traded 3,221 lots, with James Capel reported to have carried out a majority
of the day's business. This was followed by British Steel with a total of
1,676. Fisons was also busy, trading 1,493 lots.
