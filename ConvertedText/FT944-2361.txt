FT  16 DEC 94 / Counties reprieved in Banham reforms


   By JOHN AUTHERS


Most English counties will survive under reforms announced yesterday by Sir
John Banham, chairman of the Local Government Commission, reversing plans to
abolish them.
Sir John described the reorganisation of local government as a 'gamble', and
said there was no evidence that authorities created by the restructuring
would improve services.
The changes he announced would cost up to Pounds 90m to implement and
additional administrative costs of up to Pounds 35m.
Only Berkshire and Dorset, of the 18 counties for which he announced
proposals yesterday, will be abolished. That brings the total of counties to
be replaced with unitary councils - which combine the powers of district and
county councils - to eight.
Sir John has already announced that a further 26 county councils will
continue in their present two-tier form, and is expected to confirm next
month that the remaining five will also maintain the two-tier system.
In September last year, Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, said he
wanted two tiers to continue only in 'exceptional' circumstances.
However, Rutland and Herefordshire have regained their independence as
unitary authorities, having lost it in the last review in 1974. In total,
yesterday's proposals call for 20 unitary authorities to be created, with a
combined annual revenue expenditure of about Pounds 10bn and a total
workforce of about 250,000.
Sir John predicted that Rutland residents would face extra annual
administrative costs of Pounds 100 a head, but he described public support
as 'overwhelming'. Mr Alan Duncan, Rutland's Conservative MP, said local
people were 'jubilant'.
Mr Frank Dobson, the shadow environment secretary, claimed the review was
'becoming more and more chaotic and inconsistent'.
