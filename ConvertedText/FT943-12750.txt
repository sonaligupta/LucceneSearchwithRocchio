FT  23 JUL 94 / Greenspan helps dollar to rise


   By PHILIP GAWITH


Comments by senior US financial officials yesterday helped the dollar rise
to its highest level in nearly three weeks, writes Philip Gawith.
Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, restated his view
that a strong dollar was in the interests of the US economy. His remarks
followed an earlier statement from Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary,
that he believed 'very strongly' in a strong dollar.
The US currency closed in London at DM1.5955, nearly two pfennigs up on its
Thursday close of DM1.576. In New York it closed at DM1.598.
It was only modestly up against the yen in London, closing at Y98.72 from
Y98.685. In New York it finished at Y98.95. Dealers say the unresolved
US-Japan trade dispute, and Japan's large current account surplus, are
impediments to further strength in the dollar.
The week has been characterised by the concerted efforts of US officials to
persuade financial markets that they want a firmer dollar. The belief that
the Clinton administration was, at best, indifferent to the currency's fate
was one factor accounting for its recent weakness.
Analysts are reluctant to predict that the dollar's recovery will continue.
Most argue that action, in the form of higher interest rates, is also
needed.
