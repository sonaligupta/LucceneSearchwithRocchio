FT  29 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Warning of defence job losses


   By DAVID WHITE


   A STARK VISION of the future for the defence industry


with the possibility of more than 300,000 job losses by the end of the
decade - is outlined in a report due to be unveiled by the Campaign for
Nuclear Disarmament tomorrow, David White writes.
The report by Mr John Love-ring of Bristol University's School of Advanced
Urban Studies was commissioned by CND.
Reductions under the government's Options for Change review suggest about
100,000 job losses by 1995 according to the report, which puts current
defence industry employment at 600,000.
But it says the decline for the whole of the 1990s is likely to be much
steeper. It cites some 30,000 job cuts announced since 1990 and predicts
that employees in production, assembly and administration will be the
hardest hit.
Mr Lovering calls for savings from the defence budget to be used to finance
expansion in alternative markets. He also wants to see the launch of EC
policies to redirect resources. His report says the Labour party's proposals
for a defence diversification agency are 'inadequate'.
