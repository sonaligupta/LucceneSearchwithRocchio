FT  27 SEP 94 / People: WEW


WEW, the company previously known as Amber Day which runs the What Everyone
Wants chain of discount stores, has lost another senior executive. Elaine
Gray, 34, the buying director, has left by mutual agreement for 'personal
and private reasons'.
Peter Carr, chairman, says he is sorry to lose Gray, who joined the company
at a young age and worked there for nearly 17 years.
Following the resignation last month of managing director Ian Grabiner, and
the loss of a chief executive and two chairmen within the past two years,
Gray's departure is a blow for the group, which is currently engaged in an
expansion programme. However, Carr says recent restructuring of the buying
department, with the addition of four new people, will lessen the disruption
caused by her departure.
