FT  02 NOV 93 / Decline reported in export losses


   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor


NCM, Britain's leading export credit insurer, yesterday said it had detected
tentative signs of economic recovery in continental Europe.
In its latest report on the export outlook it says fewer exporters are
suffering losses because of non-payment, and payment delays have become less
severe.
The quarterly study by Cardiff-based NCM Credit Insurance shows that
non-payment problems eased in 11 of the 12 EC markets in the year to
end-September compared with the year to end-June. The exception was
Luxembourg, which is not a significant export market for the UK.
Payment delays increased by 12 per cent in the year to September, but this
marks a significant improvement from the picture three months earlier, in
which NCM reported a worsening of 52 per cent year-on-year.
'Our findings suggest that in some parts of continental Europe the recession
may have bottomed out,' said Mrs Connie Randall, NCM's director for business
strategy and reinsurance.
She nevertheless warned that bankruptcies were expected to be high in
Germany and business conditions uncertain in Belgium, France and Greece. 'In
the short run, the outlook for UK exports to Europe remains bleak,' she
said.
NCM, which provided insurance cover for Pounds 14bn of UK exports last year,
accounting for 80 per cent of the market, reported a dramatic deterioration
in payment delays in Italy - 72 per cent up in the year to end-September. In
Spain and France delays were reduced by 10 per cent and 18 per cent
respectively. Whereas one in five exporters to France experienced payment
defaults in the year to end-June, just one in 11 reported defaults in the
year to end-September.
