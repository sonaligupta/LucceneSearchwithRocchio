FT  27 MAY 93 / International Company News: Cambridge expects 'significant'
losses


Cambridge Group, the Dublin-based asset financing and confirming company,
said yesterday that it expected to report 'significant losses' for the year
to February 28 1993.
The losses put Cambridge in breach of its banking covenants and the banks
have been asked for a temporary waiver of these breaches, pending a review
of its business and renegotiation of banking facilities.
The company said the losses were due mainly to provisions in the confirming
division, because of the impact on customers in the second half of high
interest rates and exchange rate volatility.
The division's business was under review and the group annual results would
be delayed pending publication of the review.
No final dividend would be proposed.
In the six months to August 31 Cambridge saw pre-tax profits fall 43 per
cent to IPounds 1.43m.
During the period, debt facilities were increased by IPounds 9m to IPounds
74.5m.
