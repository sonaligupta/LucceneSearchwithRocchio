Stone-Consolidated, the newsprint arm of Chicago's Stone Container, halved
its losses in 1993. It said prices in the US were improving and inventories
declining.
The 1993 loss was CDollars 68.7m (USDollars 51.2m) down from CDollars 110m
in 1992 on sales of CDollars 928m, up 10.4 per cent. Paper shipments were
1.3m tonnes, up from 1.25m. The company said costs had been reduced and
strong timber prices and a lower Canadian dollar had helped.
