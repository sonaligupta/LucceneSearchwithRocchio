FT  02 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Kinnock warns on role of successor


   By RALPH ATKINS


MR Neil Kinnock warned Labour MPs yesterday that his successor as party
leader should not be forced to devote as much effort as he had to internal
reorganisation but must be allowed to 'accentuate the positive'.
He backed implicitly as swift a review as possible of the party machinery
after the general election defeat. His successor should be seen as winning
for the party, not within the party, he said.
At the same meeting, Mr Roy Hattersley, outgoing deputy leader, said the
party had spent so much time on internal reform and making clear what a
Labour government was not going to do that it had had neither the time or
the opportunity to set out what it stood for.
In spite of concern by some Labour MPs that the party's election inquest
would prove too superficial, Mr John Smith, shadow chancellor and favourite
to win this month's leadership election, wants any reform of Labour's links
with trade unions completed by the 1993 autumn conference.
Mr Smith is adamant that policy changes should not be rushed.
Mr Kinnock, in what may have been his last speech as leader to the
Parliamentary Labour party, said that 'years of denigration' of the party by
the Tory media had contributed to Labour's defeat.
