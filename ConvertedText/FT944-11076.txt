FT  08 NOV 94 / Arts: Today's Television


   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY


The 'Ooh isn't it ghastly show me more' school of journalism seems to be
steadily taking over BBC1. Today's Natural Neighbours is all about spiders
and why they frighten so many people. It is almost impossible to read the
description of the programme without hearing the voice of Vincent Price: 'As
night falls, spiders in and around the house start their predatory
wanderings ..' (8.30). You have to hand it to the people who run Channel 4's
culture series Without Walls: they really do attack sacred cows. Yet even
they have surely never taken aim at anything quite as sacrosanct as
tonight's target - Mother Theresa of Calcutta. In a programme produced by
Tariq Ali, journalist Christopher Hitchens argues that the supposed saint is
actually a demagogue and a servant of earthly powers (9.00). The second part
offers a dramatisation of the last days of rock singer Janis Joplin (9.30).
Like most half-way-competent British films these days, Peter's Friends was
over praised when released in 1992. It is a comedy of manners about six
friends who meet again 10 years after leaving university (10.00 C4).
