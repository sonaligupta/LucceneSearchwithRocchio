growth

DESPITE lower tobacco profits from Australia and a difficult year for luxury
goods, the Swiss-based Richemont group, controlled by the Rupert family in
South Africa, recorded an 11 per cent rise in earnings in the year to March.
Sales rose by 4 per cent to Pounds 3.1bn while pre-tax profits advanced by a
similar margin to Pounds 620m (Dollars 1.15bn). Attributable profits, before
extraordinary items, were 11.3 per cent higher at Pounds 197.3m. Earnings
per depositary unit rose 11.3 per cent to Pounds 343.60, while dividends per
unit are being increased by 11.1 per cent to Pounds 56.25.
The company also plans to subdivide the Richemont units in the ratio of 10
to 1 to bring them to a level more comparable with the shares of other
leading companies on the Swiss stock exchanges.
Richemont has large interests in tobacco and luxury goods. Companies and
brand names which form part of the group include Rothmans, Dunhill, Cartier
Monde, Mont Blanc pens and Piaget watches.
Richemont is a highly sought after share in Johannesburg, because of its
hard currency earnings. Its market capitalisation of about R19.2bn (Dollars
6.86bn) is the highest of any industrial company on the Johannesburg Stock
Exchange. It is trading on a price/earnings multiple of 23.2 and a dividend
yield of 0.7.
Tobacco operating profits from subsidiaries rose by 15.4m to Pounds 367m,
due largely to improved profitability in Canada, Germany and Poland.
Meanwhile, operating profits on the luxury goods side rose to Pounds 214.6m
from Pounds 206.1m. Costs savings helped boost Cartier's profits by 7.6 per
cent to 163.6m. Sales at Dunhill were 10.6 per cent higher at Pounds 230.4m
due to the purchase of a substantial interest in Alfred Dunhill's Japanese
distributor. Dunhill operating profits were marginally higher at Pounds
55.7m.
