FT  25 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Tomkins


Footnote to the debate on corporate governance. News yesterday that Tomkins'
Mr Gregory Hutchings has been awarded a 54 per cent pay increase puts him
third in a league table of top directors' pay at UK engineering and holding
companies as a multiple of average employee remuneration. His near-Pounds 1m
package puts him on a multiple of 60, against 80 at Hanson and 68 at TI
Group. Intriguingly five of the top seven companies combined the post of
chairman and chief executive, while the other two (Tomkins and Williams)
could not be described as overweight with non-executive directors.
