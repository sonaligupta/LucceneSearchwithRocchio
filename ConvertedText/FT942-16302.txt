FT  11 APR 94 / World Bond Markets: London


   By PHILIP COGGAN


The main statistic of the week will be Friday's retail price index for
March. After February's disappointing numbers, the markets will be looking
for a fall in the underlying rate (excluding mortgage payments) to 2.6 per
cent. The headline annual rate is expected to be unchanged at 2.4 per cent.
Mr James Barty, UK economist at Morgan Grenfell, says he thinks the last
inflation numbers caused an over-reaction, but adds, 'the markets are going
to want an assurance there has been no pick-up in inflationary pressures'.
Another statistic that will be closely watched is the January whole world
trade figure. The December Pounds 1.6bn deficit awakened fears that the UK's
tendency to suck in imports was recurring. Analysts are hoping that the
January deficit will have dropped to Pounds 1.3bn.
Gilts seemed to have stabilised last week, despite strong data on UK
industrial output. By the time trading resumed on Tuesday, the US payroll
numbers, published on Good Friday, were digested with relative calm.
According to SG Warburg Securities, spreads versus US Treasuries have
narrowed to 70 basis points from 128 basis points two weeks ago. But a more
sustained rally may need firmer evidence that fears of a revival in US and
UK inflation are unwarranted.
