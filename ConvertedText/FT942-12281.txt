FT  30 APR 94 / PIA chief warns on sales cash disclosure


   By NORMA COHEN


Mr Joe Palmer, chairman of the Personal Investment Authority, yesterday
warned that new regulations requiring sales agents to disclose their
commission arrangements 'will not be a panacea', Norma Cohen writes.
Mr Palmer told the conference in Brighton of the National Association of
Pension Funds: 'Many people are justifiably concerned about commission bias.
But I'm not sure that changing the commission structure will be a panacea
which ushers in a new utopia.'
Mr Palmer also said that the Treasury and the Securities and Investments
Board were still concerned about the ability of a small life insurer to
regulate the sales activities of a much larger tied agent, such as a
building society.
