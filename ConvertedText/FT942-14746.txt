FT  19 APR 94 / Observer: Bloated


Political hacks were distinctly thin on the ground at BBC Enterprises'
launch party for the publication of Tony Benn's diary tapes at the House of
Commons yesterday.
Indeed, it seemed largely to be an exercise in feeding numerous
functionaries from obscure corners of the BBC, many of whose ample titles
barely fitted onto the name tags. A surprising proportion proved more than a
little vague on the subject of the Benn product.
