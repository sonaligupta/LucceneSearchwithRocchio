FT  12 MAR 93 / International Company News: Swedbank pushed further in the
red by credit loss surge


   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES


SWEDBANK, the Swedish savings bank, underlined the extent of the crisis in
the Swedish banking sector when it announced a sharp increase in operating
losses to SKr11.8bn (Dollars 1.5bn) in 1992 from the SKr4.4bn it suffered a
year earlier.
The bank blamed its performance on a surge in credit losses, which amounted
to SKr18.5bn, or 4.5 per cent of total lending, compared with SKr10.2bn in
1991.
It expects loan losses to continue at a high level in the next two years
because of the continuing crisis in the Swedish economy.
The bank has applied to the government for support to ensure that its
capital adequacy ratio stays above 8 per cent.
Swedbank was only formally established at the end of 1992, following the
merger of 11 different savings banks, although the merger is retroactive to
January 1 1992.
The 1991 figures are pro-forma.
The operating result before loan losses climbed 17 per cent to SKr6.8bn from
SKr5.8bn.
Two-thirds of loan losses stemmed from the real estate sector, with private
individuals accounting for just 10 per cent of the total.
The bank said its 20 largest losses accounted for SKr6.4bn, or 35 per cent
of the total.
Total problem exposures after provisions amounted to SKr25.7bn, or 6 per
cent of total lending, at the end of 1992 when its capital adequacy ratio
stood at 9.3 per cent.
The bank is aiming to cut expenses by SKr2bn by the end of next year from
their 1991 level of SKr9.6bn.
Last year it cut 1,280 full-time jobs.
This helped it to reduce expenses by 12 per cent.
