FT  26 OCT 92 / Construction Contracts: Work begins on new jewel house at
Tower of London


BUILDING WORK will begin next month on the expanded Pounds 10m Jewel House
project at the Tower of London. The design and construction work is being
managed by LEHRER McGOVERN INTERNATIONAL, part of the Bovis Construction
Group.
The new Jewel House will open for Easter 1994 and will accommodate over
2,500 visitors per hour - a total of 20,000 visitors a day - whereas the
present area was designed in the 1960s for a peak attendance of 5,000
visitors daily.
The new display area will be three times larger than at present and will be
spread over the whole of the ground floor of the Duke of Wellington's
barracks. The design incorporates a short length of slowly moving floor past
the most important jewels.'
The main objectives are to provide better viewing facilities, incorporate
the highest level of security, allow access for disabled people and
eliminate long queues.
LMI has assembled a team of design consultants and other specialists who are
working closely with experts from the historic royal palaces.
Mr Ken Percy, who is in charge of the project for LMI, said: 'We won this
assignment because we were able to demonstrate that we had the skill,
experience and depth of resources necessary to handle a very complex and
highly sensitive project.
'In total there are over 20 trade contractors involved in the project and at
peak we anticipate around 100 people working on the site. Given the
sensitive nature of the project, strict security precautions are already in
place and will remain in force for the duration of the work.'
