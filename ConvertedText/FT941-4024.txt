FT  12 MAR 94 / Rightwing whites agree to poll


A boycott of South Africa's first all-race elections by rightwing whites
appeared to have ended yesterday when the Freedom Front submitted a list of
candidates just before a midnight deadline. The decision brought to 27 the
number of parties participating in the April poll. The Inkatha Freedom Party
of Zulu chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi is the only sizeable faction to fail to
meet the nomination deadline. An electoral commission official said Inkatha
would be dropped from the ballot paper.
