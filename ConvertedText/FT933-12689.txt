FT  23 JUL 93 / Prosecutor speaks: Discovery of data seen as link with ex-GM
executive


Excerpts from the Darmstadt prosecutor's statement:
Investigative proceedings have now been opened, in addition to those against
Mr Lopez and Mr Gutierrez, against two other former employees of Opel AG who
also moved to VW.
On 22.06.93 four boxes of documents located in a property in Wiesbaden
Breckenheim were made available to. . . police. The two former employees of
Opel AG against whom preliminary proceedings have also been initiated, lived
there. In addition to papers the boxes contained files, overhead
transparencies and slides.
Examinations so far show that these are documents from Adam Opel and GM. In
the meantime, some of the documents have been evaluated and clarified by
extensive examination of witnesses. According to this it would seem that the
documents handed over contain data from the technical development centre of
Adam Opel and are also related to the small car project (O-car). These
documents were only available to top representatives of the management. The
documents included sales strategies, cost savings and information about the
new Vectra.
Some of the overhead projection transparencies and photographic slides were
(allegedly) assembled, and translated into German, at the express wish of Mr
Lopez. Investigation will continue, with special attention to witnesses from
VW.
