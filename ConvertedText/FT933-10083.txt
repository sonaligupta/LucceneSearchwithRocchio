FT  06 AUG 93 / Functions of a German supervisory board


AS ITS NAME suggests, the prime function of a German company's supervisory
board is to oversee the activities of the board of management, ensuring
efficiency and proper conduct.
Its key active roles include the selection of executive directors and
approval of large capital investments or acquisitions.
In principle, though not in law, 'the supervisory board bears the same
responsibility for mistakes as the management board,' according to Mr Tom
Sommerlatte, European head of the Arthur D. Little consultancy.
The composition varies, but certain constants apply. Large shareholders,
often banks, are strongly represented; retired senior management board
members are almost always found a place, with other seats reserved for
employee representatives. Politicians, academics, insurance experts and
lawyers are optional extras.
At Volkswagen, almost 20 per cent owned by the Social Democrat Lower Saxony
government, the membership includes two senior SPD politicians and nine
representatives of employees and unions. Mr Otto Lambsdorff, former head of
the liberal Free Democrats, speaks for the DSW shareholders' association.
