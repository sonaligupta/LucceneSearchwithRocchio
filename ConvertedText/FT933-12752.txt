FT  22 JUL 93 / International Company News: Acquisition lifts Martin
Marietta


   By RICHARD WATERS


   NEW YORK


MARTIN Marietta, the US defence contractor which took over GE Aerospace in
April, recorded a 25 per cent rise in second-quarter net income due to a
first-time contribution from its acquisition.
Net income rose to Dollars 124m, from Dollars 99m in the second quarter of
1992, on sales up from Dollars 1.6bn to Dollars 2.6bn. Earnings per share on
a fully-diluted basis fell to Dollars 1.98 from Dollars 2.06, reflecting an
increase of 14.5m in the shares outstanding as a result of a convertible
stock issue connected with the GE transaction.
New debt associated with the takeover took gearing to 41 per cent by the end
of June, which the company described as 'manageable'.
For the first half, before the effect of a change in accounting for
retirees' health benefits, post-tax profits were Dollars 200m, or Dollars
3.62, compared with Dollars 174m, or Dollars 3.57, in the first six months
of 1992.
Around Dollars 1.2bn of sales in the second quarter came from the company's
new electronics division, forged after the takeover. This unit achieved an
operating margin of 9 per cent, compared with a 10 per cent margin in the
space division.
