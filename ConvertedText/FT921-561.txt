FT  28 MAR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar drops in Europe


THE DOLLAR dropped sharply yesterday in European trading and was also
suffering in New York at DM 1.6445/52 and Y133.14/19 mid-session in New
York, writes Andrew Jack.
In low-volume Asian trading, the dollar had weakened slightly against the
yen and firmed against the d-mark, with most trading being pre-weekend
position adjustments, according to dealers. It closed at Y133.85 and DM
1.6637.
During the day in London it had drifted below DM 1.66 after an early
speculative attempt to break DM 1.6620 failed. In the late afternoon in
London a single speculator, rumoured to be a south east Asian central bank,
sold dollars in a thin market. It closed at DM 1.6440 and Y133.15.
In New York, the release of mixed US economic data appeared to have little
effect on the dollar. February personal income rose 1.1 per cent, while
spending increased 0.9 per cent, against analysts' prediction of 0.7 per
cent and 0.8 per cent. Freddie Mac, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corporation, showed that the average interest rate for a 30-year fixed
mortgage was 8.98 per cent for the week ended March 27, down from 9.03 per
cent last week.
'The dollar is range-trading, trying to see what the lowest levels might
be,' said Mr Michael Feeny, senior dealer at Sumitomo bank in London. 'It
started falling before the numbers came out and was more driven by the
d-mark/yen. There is just routine dollar trading. It is very, very quiet
before the year end.'
Mr David Cocker, treasury adviser at Chemical bank in London, said: 'The
main activity was selling of the dollar out of New York. 'It was purely
speculative trading in a narrow range and nothing to do with the economy.
There was some attempt to up it up yesterday which failed so now they were
selling again.' 'The big thing today was the d-mark/yen. There is still no
sign of the long expected Bank of Japan interest rate cut. The Bundesbank is
just keeps laying down the law. Its European monetary union conditions are
getting stricter and stricter, reflecting the public waking up to the
economic realities.'
The mark rose to an 11-week high of Y1.235 and 109.69/82 Swiss francs in
Frankfurt in afternoon trade. This was partly fuelled by a hawkish speech
from Herr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, a Bundesbank board member, who told an
investment conference in Berlin that it would be intolerable if monetary
growth exceeded Bundesbank targets. This caused further speculative selling
of the dollar.
Sterling gained on the dollar fall, gaining more than one cent to close at
Dollars 1.7380 against Dollars 1.7260 at the start of trade. It dropped 0.19
pfennigs to close at DM 2.8581. The trade index closed up 0.1 and 90.2.
