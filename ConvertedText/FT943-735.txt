Venezuela's GDP contracted by 2.7 per cent during the first half of 1994,
compared to the same period last year, according to preliminary figures
published by the Central Bank of Venezuela. Venezuela's GDP registered
negative growth of 1 per cent in 1993, and the government is projecting a
3.3 per cent contraction for 1994. The consumer price index for the Caracas
metropolitan area rose by 29.4 per cent for the six-month period, compared
with full-year 1993 inflation of 46 per cent. The government estimates that
inflation will reach 65 per cent this year, but it may top 80 per cent. The
bank also reported that international monetary reserves stood at Dollars
8.86bn at the end of June 1994, down from Dollars 12.7bn at the close of
1993, and an overall balance of payments deficit of around Dollars 2.7bn for
the first half of 1994.
