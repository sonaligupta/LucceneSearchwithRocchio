FT  09 JAN 92 / Plan to increase modern manufacturing techniques in
engineering endorsed by NEDC


   By ANDREW BAXTER


A PLAN to increase the use of modern manufacturing techniques, skills and
training in engineering was endorsed unanimously yesterday by the National
Economic Development Council, Andrew Baxter writes. The NEDC initiative is
intended as a response to UK engineering's more deep-seated problems, many
of which have been exacerbated by the recession. The council endorsed the
plan after its meeting heard a paper combining the work of the NEDC's
engineering industry sector group and its engineering skills working party.
Afterwards Mr Bill Jordan, chairman of the industry group and president of
the AEU engineering union, said: 'The best of British companies are doing
the right things, but they are in such a thin layer across the line of
manufacturing. If we want to succeed against international competitors, we
have to turn the specific into the general.' Mr Jordan rejected charges that
the NEDC initiatives were timid. The degree of upheaval needed by companies
such as Rover attempting such a programme represented the biggest challenge
they had ever faced.
