FT  30 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow retrieves initial fall on
consumer data

Wall Street
US share prices were mixed yesterday, after bouncing back from declines made
in the morning on the heels of falling bond prices, writes Lisa Bransten in
New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished just 1.01 off at 3,738.55. The
Standard & Poor's 500 gained 1.01 at 455.17, while the Nasdaq composite
stood out with an advance of 5.74 to 751.47. New York SE volume totalled
287m shares.
For the first time in more than a week, the stock market acted in tandem
with the bond market, which was off sharply in the morning after a stronger
than expected report on consumer confidence.
The Conference Board reported that consumer confidence hit 101.3,
substantially higher than economists' expectations of about 89.
While some economists immediately wrote off the figures as an aberration,
others pointed to them as an indication of strong inflationary pressures in
the economy. Thus the market is worried that the Federal Reserve might raise
interest rates in the short term, causing an erosion of corporate earnings.
Initially share prices fell as sharply as the bond market, with the Dow off
more than 20 points in the morning, but prices pushed back up towards the
afternoon. The Dow passed briefly into positive territory before slipping
back into slightly negative ground.
Santa Fe Pacific put on Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 16 3/4 after the railroad
company put off a shareholders meeting in order to negot-iate with Union
Pacific, which had made a hostile bid for Santa Fe.
Union Pacific also rose, by Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 46 5/8 , on the news
because it increased the likelihood that the larger railroad would complete
its bid.
American Brands firmed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 34 3/8 after confirming that
it was holding 'serious discussions' regarding the sale of its Franklin Life
Insurance unit with financial group American General. The latter eased
Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 26.
Shares of the aerospace division of General Motors gained Dollars  1/2 at
Dollars 33 1/8 on news that GM's Hughes had signed an agreement that would
allow it to offer more than 400 professional basketball games in the 1994-95
season over its satellite television service DirecTV. GM was down Dollars
1/8 at Dollars 38 1/4 .
Both National Medical Enterprises and American Medical Holdings gained
ground on news that a Congressional waiting period required before the two
companies could merge had passed without requests for more information.
National Medical firmed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 13 7/8 and American Medical
Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 24 1/4 .
Retailers posted another strong day, buoyed by early reports that consumer
spending should be higher this holiday season. Dayton Hudson rose Dollars 1
3/8 to Dollars 80, Sears Roebuck Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 48 1/4 and Dillards
Department Stores Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 28 1/2 .

Advances in heavily weighted metal and industrial products shares lifted the
Toronto Stock Exchange 300 composite index to a modest gain on the day, in
spite of weakness in bond markets. The overall performance for Toronto
stocks was mixed.
The TSE 300 closed 15.23 up at 4,103.72. Falls led rises by 404 to 302 after
volume of 50.6m shares valued at CDollars 668.9m, but 10 of the 14
sub-indices were higher, led by transportation, metal, industrial products
and conglomerate stocks. Real estate, financial services and oil issues
posted the biggest declines. The golds group added 1.05 per cent, although
the New York spot bullion price eased 40 US cents to USDollars 382.95 an
ounce.
