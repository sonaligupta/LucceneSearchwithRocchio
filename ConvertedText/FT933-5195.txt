FT  04 SEP 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar weakens on payroll


   By JAMES BLITZ


NEW questions were raised about the direction of the dollar/D-Mark exchange
rate yesterday after the US non-farm payroll figure for August turned out to
be a great deal worse than the market had expected, writes James Blitz.
The market had been anticipating a net rise in the payroll figure by 144,000
in August, but it turned out to be a drop of 39,000 on the month. There were
a few silver linings in the report, with an upward revision to the July
payroll increase from 162,000 to 211,000.
But the overall impact of the data could not fail to push the dollar down,
especially since they are seen as a precursor to the figures for the US
economy that will come out later this month.
Having been at DM1.6518 against the German currency at the start of the day,
the dollar dropped to a low of DM1.6175 and later closed at DM1.6225.
Against the yen, the dollar also weakened, closing at Y105.00 from a
previous Y105.85.
Mr Marc Hendriks, head of international interest rate research at Swiss Bank
Corporation, believes that the dollar is heading downwards.
He believes that pressure on the dollar will come from the fact that
institutional investors' portfolios are heavily overweight in dollars -
perhaps to the tune of 10 per cent.
Late last month, Mr Michael R, Rosenberg, Managing Director of International
Fixed Income Research at Merrill Lynch, gave a presentation in London at
which he claimed that global investors had a net exposure of 66.75 to the
dollar on his index, up from 48.50 in November 1991. A reading of 50.00
would be neutral, and anything above that suggests an overweight position.
In Europe, the focus of attention was again on heavy selling of the Belgian
franc, despite another round of sustained intervention from the central bank
of Belgium. Again, the market perceived flaws in a high interest rate policy
to defend the currency, and this weakened the franc.
The Belgian currency fell from a close of BFr21.49 against the D-Mark on
Thursday night to as low as BFr21.83 yesterday. It later closed at BFr21.77.
The currency slid sharply in the exchange rate mechanism grid. On Thursday
evening, some 4.01 percentage points had separated it from the weakest
currency, the Danish krone. Last night, that differential amounted to only
2.73 percentage points.
The French franc was one of several European currencies which weakened. It
closed at FFr3.525 to the D-Mark from a previous FFr3.522. Sterling closed
at DM2.4775 from a previous DM2.4750.
