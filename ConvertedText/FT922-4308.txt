FT  06 JUN 92 / Milosevic pressed to quit


   By JUDY DEMPSEY


   BELGRADE


Serbia's rival political parties and nationalist movements yesterday began
jockeying for position as pressure on President Slobodan Milosevic to resign
gained momentum in the ruling establishment, writes Judy Dempsey in
Belgrade. In Mr Milosevic's ruling Serbian Socialist party, 14 deputies of
the parliamentary club yesterday broke ranks by withdrawing from the club.
The Socialists won the majority of parliamentary seats in last Sunday's
elections. The rival ultra-nationalist Radical party, led by Mr Vojislav
Seselj, won 33 of the 138 seats, which signals the the growing influence of
a militant, armed party in the republic.
Rapid fragmentation of Mr Milosevic's support is also taking place in the
Serbian Academy of Sciences, and Belgrade University, the cream of the
establishment and previously supporters. Forty-seven out of 90 academy
members present signed a petition demanding his resignation.
