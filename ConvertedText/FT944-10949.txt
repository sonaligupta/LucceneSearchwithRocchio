FT  08 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: L&G warning


   By PETER JOHN and JEFFREY BROWN


Life assurance group Legal & General slipped on news that the Texas
Department of Insurance was fining it Dollars 8.7m for mis-selling of
policies to pensioners.
The claim relates to Banner Life, L&G's US subsidiary. Analysts said
Banner's involvement in Texas represented a tiny part of L&G's overall
business, but they were concerned that the case could turn the US spotlight
on to a very sensitive area.
Mr Jonathan Sheehan of Credit Lyonnais Laing said: 'It does not look
particularly material, but in the current climate where the life sector is
not in favour it does not help sentiment.' Legal shares receded 7 to 428p.
