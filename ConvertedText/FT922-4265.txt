FT  06 JUN 92 / International Company News: Metallgesellschaft profits
static in first six months

METALLGESELLSCHAFT, the Frankfurt-based metals, mining and engineering
group, yesterday reported profits fractionally down for the first six months
of the current year.
Pre-tax profits were DM161.5m (Dollars 100.9m) in the six months to the end
of March - just DM700,000 lower than the DM162.2m made in the first half of
last year. Turnover for the six-month period rose by 17 per cent to
DM11.83bn, mainly because of acquisitions.
The company said that the flat performance - signalled earlier this year by
chief executive Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch - reflected poor prices for
non-ferrous metals and difficult conditions in its other markets, especially
for its Kolbenschmidt car parts subsidiary.
Looking ahead, the company said that it assumed results for the full year
would meet its expectations, in spite of difficult market conditions,
continued uncertainty over metal prices and a lack of evidence of a decisive
upturn in the economic outlook in Germany.
The company said profits from engineering would drop over the course of the
year, in spite of a rising order book, but it had high hopes for the
contribution from the businesses bought last year from Stora of Sweden -
Buderus (building materials and stainless steel goods), Dynamit Nobel
(explosives and plastics) and Cerasiv (ceramics and engineering plastics).
