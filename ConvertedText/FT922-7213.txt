FT  20 MAY 92 / Germany promises new way to charge foreign lorries on road
network


   By QUENTIN PEEL


   BONN


Germany yesterday promised to find some new way to charge foreign lorries
using its road network for transit, after the European Court of Justice
ruled that its present tax plan was contrary to the Treaty of Rome, writes
Quentin Peel in Bonn.
Mr Gunther Krause, transport minister, expressed disappointment at the
result, and promised to put forward a new plan which would be 'fair to
German interests and conform to EC law'.
He said the government's aim remained the same: to ensure that all road
haulage should pay directly for using German roads. This should reduce
congestion on the autobahn system, strengthen the competitiveness of the
railways, and make the whole transport system more environmentally friendly.
The tax would have required all heavy goods vehicles using the German roads,
with a permitted loaded weight in excess of 18 tonnes, to pay an annual
licence fee ranging from DM2,000 (Pounds 680) to DM9,000 (Pounds 3,060).
The European Court decided the tax contravened the article of the Rome
Treaty forbidding discrimination against road hauliers from other member
states.
