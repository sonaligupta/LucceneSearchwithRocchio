FT  05 JUN 92 / Observer: Swiss courage


Switzerland's reputation for security and stability has taken knocks lately.
But Zurich Insurance, one of the biggest of its kind in Europe, wants to
leave no doubt about its continuing strength.
Asked how it would shape up to the most damaging sequence of disasters
imaginable, chief executive Rolf Huppi was pat with the answer. The worst he
could think of, he replied, was the California coast sliding into the ocean
followed by a massive earthquake in Tokyo, a hurricane sweeping up the US
eastern seaboard, and torrential storms swamping western Europe.
'Then we would flinch,' he said . . .but hastily added: 'I don't think it
would kill us."
