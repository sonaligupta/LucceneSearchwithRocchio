FT  16 JAN 92 / World Trade News: BP quits Qatar gas project


   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES


BRITISH Petroleum said yesterday it would pull out of Qatar's huge liquefied
natural gas (LNG) export project. BP said its 7.5 per cent stake in Qatargas
would now revert to the Qatar General Petroleum Corporation, which holds a
70 per cent share in the project.
Qatargas was set up seven years ago to export LNG from the country's North
field. The Dollars 5bn project to develop the world's largest gas field is
run by the QGPC (Qatar's state energy company) and three foreign partners.
Total, a French resources company, and Mitsui and Marubeni, Japanese trading
houses, have 7.5 per cent each of the project.
BP said its decision to pull out was made for internal reasons and that,
given the calls on its investment funds, it would get better returns
elsewhere.
