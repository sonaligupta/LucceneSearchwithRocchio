FT  14 APR 94 / UK Company News: NM Smaller Australian


A conversion share issue by NM Smaller Australian Companies Trust has raised
Pounds 27.9m through a placing and intermediaries offer, approximately
doubling the size of the trust, which was launched in December.
However, like most investment trust issues in the last few weeks, the
outcome fell short of the target size, set at Pounds 35m.
Another conversion issue, from Fleming European Fledgeling Investment Trust,
has raised Pounds 14.7m, well below its target of about Pounds 50m. Of the
new money, Pounds 10.5m came from an institutional placing, and Pounds 4.2m
from a public offer.
