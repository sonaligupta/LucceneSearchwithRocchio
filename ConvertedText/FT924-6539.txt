FT  20 NOV 92 / Technology: Taking a shine to synthetic diamonds


   By DELLA BRADSHAW


A diamond chunk the shape of an eagle is the promise of a technique
developed at Pennsylvania State University for producing cheaper industrial
diamonds. The process borrows techniques from the two existing methods of
synthetic diamond production, but adds an ingredient of its own - a fine
powder of silicon or metal dust.
As with the original General Electric process, the technique starts with
solids - graphite, carbon or wood. This is mixed with the silicon or metal
powder and then heated in an atmosphere rich in atomic hydrogen - in a
similar way to the chemical vapour deposition process.
The shape of the final diamond product can be determined at the beginning of
the process - a wire, sheet or cube. The method can produce solid diamonds
in layers of up to about 50 microns, but the larger diamond shapes are
porous. Pennsylvania State University: US, 814 865 3421.
