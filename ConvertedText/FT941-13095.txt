FT  27 JAN 94 / People: Bantz shifts to NatWest


Bruce Bantz has been appointed head of global asset securitisation at
NatWest Capital Markets, a new post set up to reflect a stronger focus on
its securitisation business.
Bantz, previously vice president, treasury funding, at Citibank's credit
card securitisation arm, will be based in London and will report to Garry
Southern, managing director of NatWest Capital Markets.
Europe's nascent market in asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities is
dwarfed by the US market, and has so far failed to take off.
Southern says he expects no explosive growth but predicts the market will
move up a gear or so over the next few years.
NatWest has been involved in several sterling mortgage-backed deals, and has
set up a vehicle called Thames Funding, which acts as a conduit for
corporate asset-backed commercial paper.
While sterling will remain a priority, NatWest plans to expand into other
European markets.
