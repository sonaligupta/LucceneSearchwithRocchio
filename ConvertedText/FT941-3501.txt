FT  16 MAR 94 / Customs won over by baggy fashions


   By ANDREW JACK


Trends in teenage fashion finally reached senior officials at the Customs &
Excise Department, who have agreed to stop children's baggy clothing falling
into the value added tax net.
In sombre statement yesterday, the department announced it would issue a
revised schedule of maximum measurements of clothing and footwear eligible
for relief.
The effect will be to waive VAT on sales of baggy trousers and sweatshirts
in sizes designed for children aged up to 14.
The move followed 18 months of discussion with clothing manufacturers, which
claimed that the latest styles of baggier clothing were being unfairly
excluded from the VAT relief applicable to children's clothes. 'This
reflects the fact that fashions change and children are getting bigger,'
said Ms Liz Fox, assistant director of the British Clothing Industry
Association.
Customs officials had raised worries about whether adults would be able to
squeeze into the clothes and wear them skin-tight. They have now got around
the problem by permitting extra large chest and waist measurements, but more
child-length sleeve and inside leg sizes.
'Grown-ups aren't going to get away with it,' a Customs official said
yesterday, adding that girls' shoes between sizes 1 1/2 and 5 1/2 would have
relief from VAT provided they were not fashion shoes.
