FT  01 NOV 93 / Observer: Old song


The professional advisers behind the rescue of Canary Wharf seem somehow to
have preserved their sense of humour during the last few months of
negotiations. But, as children, they were clearly all far too serious-minded
to watch cartoons.
The company that rises Phoenix-like in place of Olympia & York to control
the Docklands development is called Sylvester Investments, apparently named
after the cartoon cat that pursued Tweety Pie, the canary.
Only problem is, in the cartoon Tweety Pie was never caught. Unlike the
bankers and other creditors to Canary Wharf. . .
