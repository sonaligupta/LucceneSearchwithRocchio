FT  29 APR 94 / International Company News: Poseidon Gold holds steady

Poseidon Gold, part of the Normandy Poseidon group, yesterday announced
operating profits of ADollars 52.2m (USDollars 36.7m), after tax, for the
nine months to end-March. This compares with ADollars 51.6m in the same
period of the previous year.
The company, which recently won a contested bid battle for Aztec Mining,
said equity production for the nine-month period was 548,342 ounces, a 1.6
per cent increase over the corresponding period of 1992-93. The average gold
price received by the PosGold companies was ADollars 586 per ounce, compared
with an average spot price of ADollars 555.
Great Central Mines, the Australian mining group whose shares soared last
year when it became known that a New York rabbi had prophesied it would
enjoy significant finds, is to spin off its diamond exploration interests
into a separate company and concentrate on gold mining.
The diamond interests will be transferred to Astro Mining, at an
'anticipated' value of ADollars 7m. Astro will issue 70.2m shares to GCM,
which will pass them on to its current shareholders, on a pro-rata basis.
GCM is run by Mr Joseph Gutnick, a member of the ultra-orthodox Lubavicher
sect whose leader is Brooklyn-based Rebbe Schneerson.
GCM's market capitalisation rose to more than ADollars 1bn last year on the
back of the discovery of 'microdiamonds' in the Greater Nabberu region of
Western Australia and talk of the rabbi's prophesy.
The diamond interests have yet to prove economic, but GCM has subsequently
discovered a more promising gold deposit at Bronzewing in Western Australia.
