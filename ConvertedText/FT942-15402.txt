FT  15 APR 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Computer becomes a piano
teacher


   By DELLA BRADSHAW


Would-be pianists for whom lessons still involve practising scales may soon
be relieved of the boredom with colour, sound and action software which
teaches the piano for a fraction of the cost of a human teacher.
The Pounds 109 Musicware Piano Course One gives pianists the equivalent of a
year's music lessons, from the basics to playing with both hands, reading
music and so on.
Developed in Redmond, Washington, by Musicware Piano, and distributed in
Europe by Et Cetera, of Lancashire, the software can be used by anyone with
a Windows PC, keyboard and sound card.
Musicware: US, 206 881 9797. Et Cetera: UK, 0706 228039.
