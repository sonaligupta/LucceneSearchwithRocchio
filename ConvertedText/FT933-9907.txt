FT  06 AUG 93 / International Company News: Canadian urges deal on
reservations


   By BERNARD SIMON


   TORONTO


CANADIAN Airlines International has made a desperate plea for its
arch-rival, Air Canada, to sanction its withdrawal from a computerised
reservations network in which both airlines are shareholders.
The plea comes amid signs that time is running out for Canadian in its
efforts to complete a far-reaching alliance with American Airlines.
The deal is conditional on Canadian pulling out of the Gemini reservations
system, and joining American's Sabre network. Canadian has warned that
failure to cement the American deal before the end of the year would mean
almost certain bankruptcy.
Canada's director of competition policy yesterday asked the competition
tribunal to dissolve Gemini or to order Gemini to dispose of its core
'hosting' business, which handles airlines' internal seat management.
However, Canadian is concerned that the tribunal may not approve either of
these actions or, if it does, that the issue could remain bogged down in
appeals far beyond the year-end deadline for completion of the deal with
American.
The Calgary-based airline has offered Air Canada and Covia, a unit of United
Airlines, CDollars 20m (USDollars 15.5m) in compensation for its withdrawal
from Gemini.
Air Canada, which favours a merger of the two domestic airlines, has so far
refused to sanction a break-up of Gemini's ownership.
