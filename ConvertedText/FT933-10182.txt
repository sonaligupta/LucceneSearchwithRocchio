FT  05 AUG 93 / UK Company News: United Breweries reduces deficit to Pounds
189,000


   By CATHERINE MILTON


UNITED Breweries, the regional brewer and pubs operator, is believed to be
considering a capital restructuring for the second time in nine months.
It yesterday reported pre-tax losses down from Pounds 283,607 to Pounds
189,376 in the six months to May 31.
The board, which does not propose to pay an interim dividend, has not yet
examined the restructuring proposal, which might allow a payment sooner
rather than later.
The restructuring would involve writing off a negative profit and loss
reserve of about Pounds 3m against a share premium reserve of just over
Pounds 6m, and requires the approval of the High Court.
Since last November the ailing Wiltshire brewery has been managed by the UB
Group of India, the sub-continent's largest brewer and distiller. It forms
part of UB's assault on the UK drinks distribution market.
Mr Vijay Mallya, head of the UB Group, and his family have a 15.5 per cent
stake in the USM-quoted company.
Turnover for the half year improved to Pounds 2.09m (Pounds 1.33m)
reflecting the acquisition of 37 pubs at the end of last year. Operating
margins rose to 9.44 per cent (4.49 per cent).
Mr Mallya said he had not anticipated the length of the UK recession: 'We
are not magicians.'
The small Stourbridge-based brewery, producing existing brands at near full
capacity, made a small contribution to profits but represented less than 1
per cent of the group's assets.
Mr Mallya said United Breweries made a nominal profit in May and was likely
to be profitable in the second half, but this might not translate into a
full year pre-tax profit.
UB Group has granted United Breweries sole distribution rights across the
European Community of four spirits brands which it plans to launch later
this year. It is introducing its UK-brewed Kingfisher beer into some of its
77-pub estate, which is being refurbished.
Draught Kingfisher has been excluded from a distribution joint venture with
Kent-based Shepherd Neame, which brews the brand in the UK under licence.
Bottled beer will continue to be distributed to Indian restaurants and
off-licences by the joint venture.
Interest charges rose to Pounds 386,320 (Pounds 343,511). Debt of Pounds 8m
gives gearing of 100 per cent, down from 350 per cent. Losses per share were
0.48p, down from 4.97p.
The company raised Pounds 6.9m in a placing and open offer in December as
part of a capital restructuring, and spent Pounds 8m on 37 pubs.
