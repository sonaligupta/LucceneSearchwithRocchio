FT  20 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Germany


The alarming feature of Daimler-Benz's nine-month figures is the sheer speed
of the downturn since the summer. Even at the six month stage in June the
company was predicting an improvement over the full year. The worst of the
damage has come in cars and trucks. Mercedes sold 15 per cent fewer cars in
its home market during the third quarter - a sure sign that the
reunification bubble has burst. By promising to cut 10 per cent of its
workforce over two years, Daimler-Benz is striking a tough posture. The
worry is that German companies are behind the international competition with
their house-keeping. The 2,000 redundancies announced by BASF yesterday look
like a company getting to grips with costs, but ICI was at a similar stage
in 1991.
