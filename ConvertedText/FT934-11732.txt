fall in sales

SHISEIDO, Japan's largest cosmetics company, reported a fall in sales for
the first six months to September due to the decline in consumer confidence,
but managed to post a marginal rise in profits thanks to cost reductions.
Non-consolidated pre-tax profits for the six months to September rose 1.8
per cent to Y15.7bn (Dollars 148m) on a 0.6 per cent fall in sales to
Y199.8bn. After-tax profits rose 1.8 per cent to Y7.7bn.
Sales of cosmetics remained flat at Y138.6bn, while toiletries declined 3.2
per cent to Y48.1bn. The company said higher overseas procurement of
ingredients and materials due to the high yen, contributed to profits.
For the year to March, Shiseido expected pre-tax profits of Y32.5bn on sales
of Y401bn and after-tax profits of Y15.3bn.
