FT  16 NOV 93 / Portuguese police accused

AMNESTY International, the human rights organisation, said yesterday it had
received a large number of complaints of torture and ill-treatment of
detainees by Portuguese police and prison service officers.
'It is unusual and highly disturbing to receive such a large number of
allegations from a European (Union) member.'
It said the most common forms of alleged ill-treatment were repeated kicks,
punches, kneeing, pistol-whipping and beatings with truncheons. Detainees
have also reported beatings with rubber and flexible metal hosepipes. Others
have claimed to have had objects forced into the anus and to have been
threatened with physical - including sexual - assault.
Portugal will answer the charges in Geneva today before the UN Committee
against Torture. Mr Fernando Duarte, Portugal's director of prison services,
said the treatment of prisoners had greatly improved and there had been no
fresh allegations of ill-treatment in recent years.
'Public service officers from all branches of law enforcement and prison
services are acting with virtual impunity - despite the Portuguese
government's voluntary accession to the UN Convention against Torture in
1989,' Amnesty said.
