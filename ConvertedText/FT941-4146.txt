FT  12 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Provisions hit DBS Management


A further provision for the disputes relating to the sale of bond-based
equity release schemes resulted in DBS Management, the financial services
group, reporting pre-tax profits down from Pounds 1.03m to Pounds 356,000
for the half year ended September 30.
Mr Kenneth Davy, chairman, said that progress was being made with the
release schemes and he did not think further provisions would be needed.
Turnover improved to Pounds 24.9m (Pounds 18m) resulting in trading profits
higher at Pounds 1.44m (Pounds 1.17m). Earnings per share were 7.8p (28.3p)
or 5.9p (18.6p) fully diluted.
