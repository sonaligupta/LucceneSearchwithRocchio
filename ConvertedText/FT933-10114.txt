FT  05 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Hickson activity


   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and ZHANG TINGTING


Realisation that one institution had sold a large stake in Hickson
International, the specialty chemicals group, came too late to affect the
share price significantly, but dealers said some 5 per cent of the company's
equity changed hands yesterday.
One institutional fund is believed to have disposed of its holding, and
after official dealing ended the Seaq electronic dealing system showed a
large number of block trades carried out at 204p a share and total turnover
of 11m shares.
The principal shareholders are Baring, Britannic Assurance, PDFM - the UBS
fund management arm - and Gartmore. The initial feeling was that PDFM had
sold its 5.6 per cent holding, but the fund said it had not been involved
and the finger later pointed to Gartmore, which in April was recorded as
holding 4.1 per cent of the issued equity. Hickson shares finished a penny
easier at 213p.
