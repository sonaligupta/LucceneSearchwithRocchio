FT  08 NOV 94 / Observer: Party for the people


You have to travel far these days to see a proper celebration of the 1917
Bolshevik revolution. To Hanoi in fact, where communist officials
commemorating the 77th anniversary yesterday laid wreaths at a statue of
Lenin.
The newspaper Hanoi Moi declared the revolution 'the most glorious event of
the 20th century', while party ideologist Vu Huu Ngoan wrote in another
paper, Nhan Dan, that 'we have to build a clean, strong, well-organised
party . . . the failure of perestroika in the Soviet Union reminds us that a
socialist-oriented society must have renovation'.
In Moscow, pro-communists were banned from Red Square. Instead, a group of
Western clowns did tricks for children: 'Here's the proletarian revolution;
now you see it, now you don't'
