FT  24 OCT 94 / Italy party chief in merger plea


   By ANDREW HILL


   MILAN


Mr Gianfranco Fini, leader of the MSI/National Alliance, Italy's
extreme-right political grouping, yesterday promised hardline neo-fascists
in the MSI that a full merger with the National Alliance would open a
'wonderful new phase' in the party's history. At a meeting of MSI leaders on
Saturday, Mr Fini confirmed plans to absorb the old party, founded after the
war by followers of fascist dictator Benito Mussolini, into the
'post-fascist' Alliance, which has been part of Italy's governing coalition
since the March elections. The proposal, broached last month, will be put to
MSI members at a party congress to begin on January 25.
Though Mr Fini's speech drew angry reactions from hardline MSI members, it
got broad support from most of his audience. Mr Fini reinforced his message
yesterday by urging MSI members not to ally themselves with the hard left in
Italian politics against the government. 'The MSI was the political
instrument of the alternative right wing; the National Alliance is the
instrument of the right wing in government,' he said.
In public relations terms, a merger would be the most important step yet
taken by Mr Fini to distance the Alliance from its neo-fascist roots and to
mollify hostile public opinion outside Italy. Last week, TV pictures were
broadcast round the world of MSI/National Alliance deputies taking part in a
brawl with opponents in Italy's lower house of parliament.
