FT  02 NOV 93 / Ford cuts Escorts by up to Pounds 1,370


   By KEVIN DONE


FORD, the leader of the UK new car market, has cut the prices of some of its
Escort range by up to Pounds 1,370, Kevin Done writes.
Ford, which has been heavily criticised in recent weeks by the retail motor
trade for 'forcing registrations' and 'distorting' the true state of the new
car market, said it was 'moving away from dealer incentives towards more
customer-focused incentives'.
The Escort was the best-selling car in the UK for the first nine months of
the year on aggregate, but came under pressure in September when it fell to
fourth place with the rival Vauxhall Astra coming second. Ford's market
share fell to 18.8 per cent in September.
The company said yesterday that it was launching a 'One Price' programme for
the Escort range, offering the saloon, hatchback or estate models at one
maximum price in each of three specification levels.
The Escort LX range, for example, previously at Pounds 10,890 to Pounds
12,260, will now have a maximum list price of Pounds 10,890 regardless of
body style or engine capacity.
