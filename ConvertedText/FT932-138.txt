FT  30 JUN 93 / Letter: Service contract rights


   From Mr MICHAEL D VARCOE-COCKS


Sir, Corporate lawyer Ronnie Fox writes that the starting point for
calculating a payment for termination of employment of an executive is (my
emphasis) the amount that the executive would have earned during the
unexpired notice period (Letters, June 28).
Although I agree broadly with the rest of the letter, as a fellow corporate
lawyer, I believe the starting point should be what the executive would have
been entitled by contract under his service agreement (including any
provisions for mitigation), although earnings for the unexpired notice
period may form an important element in the final amount. Mr Fox is right to
point out the unfairness of mitigation in the case of a senior executive in
his 50s, but where such an executive is able to move quickly to a new job on
comparable terms, there is no reason why his compensation should be not be
mitigated if that is what the service agreement provides.
The agreement is what the parties negotiated at the outset and, where senior
executives are concerned, they will have had a reasonable say in the terms.
The agreement should foresee a broad range of possibilities and provide a
reference point for both employee and employer to assess the likely result
of early termination.
