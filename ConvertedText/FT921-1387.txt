FT  24 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Nestle/Perrier


Paris is preparing for the denouement of the most absorbing cross-border
continental European takeover tussle since the three-cornered fight for
Societe Generale de Belgique. Details of the carve-up between major
participants will only be announced today, but whatever the sweeteners the
Agnelli family is being forced to retreat with a bloody nose.
The irony is that the story has not been one of foreigner in shining armour
frustrated by Machiavellian intrigue at the French establishment. The
Agnellis look to have got what they deserved for trying to avoid paying a
fair price for Exor, and then conniving in what looked like a dubious, and
subsequently disallowed, poison pill manoeuvre which was masterminded by
Exor and Perrier chairman Jacques Vincent.
