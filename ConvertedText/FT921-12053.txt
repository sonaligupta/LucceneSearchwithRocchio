FT  29 JAN 92 / Observer: Teething trouble


The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development's first equity
investment in a privately owned eastern European company - Hungary's
Microsystem - looks to be less than a textbook case of how to harness
international equity flows for cash-strapped entrepreneurs.
Microsytem approached Salomon Brothers International for help with a small
equity private placement last May. EBRD, which had hired Salomon's European
investment banking chief Ronald Freeman to head its own merchant banking
operation, also got involved. All went well until Salomon's London office
began feeling the fall-out of the US treasury bond scandal.
Upset by the lack of commitment and high turnover of Salomon staff working
on the deal, Microsystem chairman Peter Vadasz complained to Lord Young, the
former UK cabinet minister and Salomon director, who had introduced him to
the firm in the first place. Vadasz said Salomon's handling of his placement
resembled something written by Kafka, and its 'irresponsible, cynical and
unaccountable' behaviour was damaging his company.
The appeal to Mrs Thatcher's former troubleshooter seemed to do the trick.
Salomon plumbed its own pocket to make up the difference, enabling its
partner EBRD to close its first equity investment in eastern Europe, and
everyone is smiling again.
But it may take a little longer to repair Salomon's reputation in an area
where it was supposed to reign supreme.
