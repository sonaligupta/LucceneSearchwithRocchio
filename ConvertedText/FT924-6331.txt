FT  21 NOV 92 / Finance & The Family: At A Glance - Mortgage lending picks
up a little


Building societies reported a small increase in mortgage lending activity
last month. Net advances increased to Pounds 683m in October, up from Pounds
446m the month before. But the new figure is still less than half the amount
lent by building societies in most months during the first two-thirds of the
year.
Mark Boleat, director-general of the Building Societies Association, said
that the pick up 'although very modest, occurred against the backdrop of
considerable uncertainty in the financial markets and extinguished household
confidence.'
Meanwhile, a large number of banks and building societies cut their mortgage
rates to about 8.5 per cent this week. Cheltenham & Gloucester, which had
undercut the market with its 9.05 mortgage rate when the standard rate was
9.25 per cent, also dropped its rate to 8.5 per cent.
