FT  29 JAN 92 / Letter (1): SIB findings on life assurance policy
terminations challenged - and 'polarisation' defended


   From Mr HUGH SCURFIELD


Sir, In three consecutive issues of the FT ('Life policies oversold' and
'Tied agents 'are overselling life policies'', January 24; 'The trouble with
endowments is. . .', January 25; 'City watchdog and the public', January 27)
reference is made to a Securities and Investments Board-sponsored
investigation into early termination rates of life assurance policies. It
seemed to me there must be some fundamental error in the investigation and I
examined the Norwich Union figures included in the survey.
Our first year termination rate in 1990 was 2.6 per cent for 10- and 25-year
endowments - a very reasonable figure. The figure included in the analysis
for Norwich Union showed a level three times higher than this. This has
confirmed my view that the investigation is flawed and I suggest no further
conclusions should be drawn from it.
