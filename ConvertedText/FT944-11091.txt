FT  08 NOV 94 / People: Readicut International


David Lenham, 47, deputy finance director of the McKechnie engineering
group, has taken over as finance director of READICUT INTERNATIONAL, the
West Yorkshire textile manufacturer. He replaces John Gibson who has left.
Lenham's arrival has been characterised as a 'team-building exercise' and is
understood to be unconnected with the financial performance of the group
which reports its interim results in a fortnight's time.
