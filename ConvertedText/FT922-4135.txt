FT  06 JUN 92 / TGWU opposes Labour reforms


   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor


THE TGWU general union, Britain's biggest union and largest affiliate to the
Labour party, yesterday signalled its intention to block any radical reform
of the link between the unions and the party.
Mr Bill Morris, TGWU general secretary, said his union would draft a motion
for the Labour conference that would reject most of the reforms being
canvassed, including the idea of giving party membership to union members
paying the political levy.
He suggested, however, that his union executive believed there could be
radical reform of the Trades Union Congress. Mr Morris said the TUC should
stop 'reinventing the wheel' by performing functions individual unions could
do for themselves, and should abandon the fiction of influencing the
government with its alternative economic analyses.
Mr Morris refused to say that Mr Norman Willis, TUC general secretary, was
the right man for the job. 'We work with the leader we have,' he said.
The TGWU statement is the latest sign of opposition to the radical shake-up
of union-Labour links that was envisaged after the general election.
All three candidates for the Labour deputy leadership now stress the
importance of retaining the link. The Nupe public-service union warned last
week that unions would not fund Labour if they had no direct influence in
the party.
Several unions, including the TGWU and the GMB general union, oppose the
Labour national executive committee's proposal to exclude unions from
selection and reselection of party candidates.
Mr Morris also countered charges that the TGWU's backing for Mr John Smith
and Mrs Margaret Beckett as leader and deputy leader was not justified given
the number of members consulted.
