FT  11 APR 94 / Observer: Sinking fortune


The flying fickle finger of fate strikes again. Even before The Sunday Times
had published its list of Britain's 500 richest people, some of its
information was looking a bit obsolete.
Take Sir Neville Bowman-Shaw and brother Trevor, who are chairman and
vice-chairman of the Lancer Boss lift truckmaker. The Sunday Times, worried
that it had 'seriously undervalued' the brothers' business, decided to more
than double the size of the family fortune to Pounds 66m. 'It is clearly a
company run with a conservative balance sheet by its far-sighted
management,' concluded The Sunday Times's wealth-watchers.
Unfortunately, Sir Neville had to call in receivers to several of Lancer's
British subsidiaries on Friday after German banks withdrew support for
Steinbock Boss, its Munich subsidiary.
