FT  30 JUN 93 / Sharif tightens grip on Punjab

   ISLAMABAD, NEW DELHI


THE GOVERNMENT of Mr Nawaz Sharif, the Pakistani prime minister, last night
sought to take control of the Punjab, the country's most populous province
and an important industrial and agricultural region.
A resolution passed in a joint sitting of parliament asked the president to
impose direct federal rule in the province.
The move was seen as an attempt to head off potential opposition from within
the Punjab provincial assembly.
There were fears that the imposition of direct rule could cause the worst
setback to government-opposition relations since Mr Sharif's return to
office, and his efforts to begin negotiations with all his political rivals.
'These people have subverted the constitution,' said Ms Benazir Bhutto, the
opposition leader. Her People's Democratic Alliance said the government had
pushed through the resolution although there was no breakdown of the
provincial government, which would require federal rule. Opposition MPs
walked out before the final vote.
A joint report by the US-based Asia Watch and Physicians for Human Rights,
published today, says Indian security forces in Kashmir 'have systematically
violated international human rights and humanitarian law by summarily
executing detainees and killing civilians in reprisal attacks', Reuter
reports from New Delhi.
'Extra-judicial executions and disappearances in Kashmir number at least in
the hundreds,' said the report.
The rebellion in Kashmir, the only Moslem-majority region in mainly Hindu
India, flared in 1990. Moslem rebels want independence or merger with
Pakistan.
