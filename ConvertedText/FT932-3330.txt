FT  15 JUN 93 / BCCI liquidators seek fee approval


   By ANDREW JACK


LIQUIDATORS to the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International plan
to seek advance approval of their fees for the coming year at the first
meeting of the formal creditors' committee, scheduled to take place on
Monday.
Accountants from Touche Ross will present the five-strong committee - whose
names were made public yesterday - with their planned budget for the
liquidation. The submission may help deflect criticism of the firm over the
level of fees it has so far billed, which amounted to more than Dollars 133m
between July 1991 and January 1993 on the UK liquidation alone.
A report on the liquidation, submitted to the Department of Trade and
Industry by Touche earlier this year, showed realisations during that period
of Dollars 648m against payments of Dollars 280.4m.
That included other expenses such as Dollars 37m on legal costs and Dollars
18m to BCCI's Luxembourg liquidators.
The informal creditors' committee, in operation until last month, had a
remit to review the fees charged by Touche but had no formal powers. The
formal committee, expected to meet monthly, has greater control under
English insolvency law.
In two separate resolutions at the first formal meeting of BCCI creditors at
London's Wembley Arena last month creditors voted in favour of establishing
a liquidation committee and selected for it five of the 24.
The committee may face some stormy sessions. Elected members include a
representative from the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, owed more than
Dollars 72m, and Dr Adil Elias, chairman of the BCCI Depositors' Protection
Association, who is owed nearly Dollars 2m.
Bury Metropolitan District Council, owed Dollars 13m, is also a member,
along with Film & Photo Pension Fund, owed Dollars 1m, and Visa
International Services Association, owed nearly Dollars 2m.
