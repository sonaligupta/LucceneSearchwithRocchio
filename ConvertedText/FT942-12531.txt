FT  29 APR 94 / Cars to Newcastle


   By CHRIS TIGHE


Nissan's new import and export terminal on the Tyne, designed to handle as
many as 300,000 vehicles a year, began operating yesterday, Chris Tighe
writes.
A cobalt-blue Micra made at the Japanese carmaker's nearby plant at
Sunderland was the first vehicle to be driven from the 27-acre terminal on
to the waiting car carrier. The ship City of Sunderland - built in Hiroshima
because Nissan was unable to find a British shipyard able to construct such
a ship - left the Tyne four hours later, carrying Micras and Primeras
destined for the carmaker's Amsterdam distribution terminal which serves
northern and eastern Europe.
Her sister ship, City of Barcelona, is due to cross the North Sea today with
another 900 Sunderland-made cars. This weekend the first imports to the Tyne
arrive in one of the company's 5,500-car capacity ships.
Nissan, which last week won its third successive Queen's Award for Exports,
is the UK's biggest car exporter. Last year its exports were worth almost
Pounds 1bn to the UK. This year the Sunderland plant will export up to
180,000 cars to 36 countries, including Japan.
Until now most Nissan exports and imports went through Teesport. Winning the
business was a coup for the Port of Tyne, which built the terminal for lease
to Nissan.
