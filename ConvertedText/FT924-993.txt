FT  21 DEC 92 / Why recovery may depend on higher bank margins


   By EDWARD BALLS


THE COMBINATION of accumulating bad debts, vocal complaints from small
businesses and a chancellor who is determined to ensure that all interest
rate cuts are passed directly to borrowers has made this a trying year for
Britain's banks. But, however justified it may be to criticise the
competence of UK bankers, their willingness and ability to lend will be a
central determinant of the pace of economic recovery next year. Whether
Britain's banks are able to start lending again soon may depend on whether
they are able to ignore Mr Norman Lamont's strictures.
Two items of economic news in the UK last week confirm the banks'
difficulties. On Thursday, Barclays bank announced a record Pounds 240m
write-off to cover property-related losses on loans made at the height of
the late 1980s boom. On Friday, the Bank of England announced that
commercial bank lending in November fell, unexpectedly, by Pounds 600m.
Nor are these problems peculiar to Britain, as the OECD acknowledged in its
latest gloomy economic outlook. Commercial banks in the US and Japan, as
well as in the UK, lent too much too cheap in the late 1980s to risky
property-related ventures, many of which have subsequently collapsed along
with the land and property prices upon which their financial health
depended. The banks are still trying to repair the damage to their balance
sheets.
This asset price collapse has bitten deep into the profits of the commercial
banks. The average rate of return on total assets of US banks was 0.73 per
cent in 1990-91 compared to 0.83 per cent in 1981-89. The average return
earned by UK banks was also 0.83 per cent in 1981-89 but has since fallen to
0.56 per cent in 1990-91, while the average return earned by Japanese banks
has slipped from 0.62 per cent to 0.40 per cent over the same period.
Commercial banks in all three countries have responded to this fall in
profitability by contracting credit growth. The charts, taken from the OECD
outlook, show the collapse in the growth of bank lending in all three
countries since 1989, particularly in the US and UK where credit has been
contracting this year.
Yet it is the rise in UK bank margins on existing loans, not the
unwillingness of the banks to make new loans, that has aroused the
chancellor's ire. Barclays and National Westminster have both raised the
average margin over the base lending rate that they charge to small business
from 3.1 percentage points 18 months ago to 3.5 percentage points today.
Are the UK banks behaving unfairly? The mark-up over the base lending rate
of UK banks is certainly bigger than that of US banks, and has risen
further. Mr Christopher Snyder, president of the Loan Pricing Corporation, a
New York-based financial information company, says that the average mark-up
over the prime lending rate for middle market loans is 1.35 percentage
points, while smaller and less credit worthy borrowers might face a 2
percentage point mark-up. He estimates that this mark-up has risen by about
0.3 percentage points over the past two years.
Yet this comparison between mark-ups is puzzling because UK bank profits are
both smaller and have fallen further than in the US. It is also misleading.
For the US banks have been encouraged by the Federal Reserve to rebuild
their balance sheets through a more direct means. While the Fed has reduced
US short-term interest rates to half UK levels by cutting the rate at which
it lends to commercial banks, the gap between the prime rate and the Fed
Funds rate has risen by 1.5 percentage points over the last two years, as
the chart shows. In the UK, by contrast, the gap between the base overdraft
rate and the money market rate is both much smaller - 0.5 percentage points
compared to over 2.5 percentage points in the US - and has been falling
recently.
So while the average US bank mark-up over prime is smaller than the mark-up
over the base lending rate in the UK, US banks margins over market interest
rates are both larger and have risen more than in Britain. And the US has a
recovery.
