FT  25 MAR 92 / Election 1992: No change on the bunometer - Ballot Box


They take their politics seriously in the West Country. Not content to wait
for the outcome of the general election, voters in the Somerset seaside
resort of Minehead are expressing their political preferences daily through
purchases at the local baker's.
Steve Wells, proprietor of the Wheatsheaf Bakery in The Parade, is baking
and selling buns with icing to match the colours of the political parties
and recording purchasers' preferences through a bunometer in the shop
window.
The results of the political bun-fight are unequivocal. Of the 250 buns sold
since baking started on Saturday, 51 per cent have been blue, 37 per cent
yellow and 12 per cent red.
Psephologists might note that the bun breakdown exactly reflects the running
order in the constituency at the last general election. Minehead lies within
defence secretary Tom King's safe Conservative seat of Bridgewater: the
turnout for the blue buns is identical to the 51 per cent vote for King in
1987. The SDP Alliance polled 30 per cent that year, and Labour 18 per cent.
Flavour cannot be a factor since, apart from the colour of the icing, all
the buns are the same.
