FT  16 JUN 93 / Midlands toll M-way scheme opposed


   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent


PUBLICATION yesterday of detailed plans for the first toll motorway, around
the north-east side of Birmingham and the Black Country, ran into immediate
opposition from environmentalists and local residents. The protests provide
a preview of the arguments that will be voiced at a public inquiry into the
road next year.
Mr Robert Key, the roads minister, opened an exhibition in Coleshill,
Warwickshire, of plans for the motorway, which will be called the Birmingham
Northern Relief Road. He was greeted with chants of 'save our countryside,
no more roads', and comments ranged from 'shame', to 'people along the line
of this road have had a gut-full', and 'you can tell MacGregor (the
transport secretary) we don't want his rotten road'.
The objections make it inevitable that a public inquiry - the second on the
proposed motorway - will take place next year. Trafalgar House and Iritecna,
the Anglo-Italian joint venture that will build and run the motorway, hope
to win clearance for the road by 1996 and open it in 1998.
Both the joint-venture company and the Department of Transport believe the
motorway will relieve congestion on the M6, a point contested by the
environmental group Friends of the Earth. Local residents are perturbed by
the toll road's route through the green belt and the prospect of disturbance
to adjacent villages.
Trafalgar House estimates the cost of the motorway at Pounds 500m. The road
would run from the M6 east of Cannock, Staffordshire, around the conurbation
to rejoin the M6 near Coleshill, by the junction of the M6 with the M42.
Plans for the motorway have been debated since 1980. Proposals for a second
orbital toll road on the western side of Birmingham and the Black Country
are less advanced.
