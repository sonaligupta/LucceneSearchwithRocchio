Meanwhile British Alcan's recycling plant in nearby Warrington is evidently
in danger of being wound up because it can't get enough cans. The reason is
that the native Brits are unusually resistant to the environment-friendly
habit of saving their drinks-tins after swallowing the contents, preferring
to throw them away.
The plant plans to stave off liquidation by importing a billion used cans a
year from North America, where 60 per cent of citizens save their
drinks-tins for recycling as against a mere 10 in the UK.
