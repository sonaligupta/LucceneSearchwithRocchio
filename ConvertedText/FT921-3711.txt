   AGDAM, AZERBAIJAN, KIEV


ARMENIAN rocket attacks on the Azerbaijani town of Agdam yesterday killed at
least five people and injured about 60, writes Jim Bodgener from Agdam,
Azerbaijan.
The town's market, school and about 40 houses were hit. Ambulances, cars and
jeeps were still bringing in the wounded to an improvised hospital at the
railway station two hours after the second salvo at midday
The intermittent rumble of artillery duels echoed from the Karabakh
mountains, about 8km from Agdam.
A school teacher said they had been attacked by 'tanks with the help of
uniformed Russians'.
Chrystia Freeland adds from Kiev: Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian
president, said yesterday that Azerbaijan had requested Ukrainian protection
from what it described as 'Armenian aggression'.
Mr Kravchuk said Ukraine would not become involved militarily in the
conflict.
He added, however, that it would put forward a peace plan at the March 20
meeting of leaders of the Commonwealth of Independent States in Kiev.
