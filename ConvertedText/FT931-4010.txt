FT  12 MAR 93 / International Company News: Compass Airlines to be wound up


   By BRUCE JACQUES


COMPASS Airlines, the independent Australian domestic air service, has
failed to secure emergency funding and will be wound up. The company
yesterday applied to the Queensland Supreme Court for appointment of a
provisional liquidator.
This followed the failure of Mr Richard Barber, the receiver/manager
appointed last week, to pull together a funding package to allow the company
to continue trading.
Compass' demise means the Australian domestic airline industry will revert
to a duo-poly, split between Australian Airlines, a Qantas subsidiary, and
Ansett, which is jointly controlled by the News group and Thomas Nationwide
Transport (TNT).
Problems at Compass emerged publicly earlier this month when directors asked
for the appointment of a receiver/manager because of delays in securing a
ADollars 9.2m (USDollars 6.5m) funding package.
The funding package had been promised by Mr Doug Reid, deputy chairman of
Compass, who appeared yesterday in a Melbourne court on two charges of
making false statements to other board members.
It is the second time in as many years that attempts to operate a third
domestic airline service in Australia have foundered.
The earlier attempt, also called Compass and using much of the same staff,
collapsed in 1991.
