FT  01 DEC 94 / International Company News: Way clear for Australian float


   By NIKKI TAIT


The way was cleared yesterday for the sale of Aerospace Technologies of
Australia, the aircraft component manufacturer, to the private sector after
legislation was passed in the federal parliament in Canberra.
The company, which was born out of the former Government Aircraft Factories
and constituted as a government business enterprise in 1986, is currently
wholly-owned by the federal government. Its main business is as a components
supplier to the big aircraft manufacturers, like Boeing or McDonnell
Douglas, although it also has a service role in the local aviation market.
The potential privatisation was announced a year ago, and expressions of
interest closed this month. The government has said it would prefer to sell
ATA as a whole, but a piecemeal approach may be considered. It is hoped a
deal can be finalised early next year.
In 1992-93, ATA notched up exports of over ADollars 130m.
