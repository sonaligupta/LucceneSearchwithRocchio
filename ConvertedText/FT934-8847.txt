FT  13 NOV 93 / Share price plunge investigated

   PARIS


France's stock market watchdog, the Commission des operations de bourse,
said yesterday it was examining the way Euro Disney released its results
this week and the movement in the leisure group's share price, writes John
Ridding in Paris. Euro Disney's shares have fallen by more than 25 per cent
on the Paris and London stock markets following Wednesday's announcement of
first year results showing a net loss of FFr5.3bn, largely the result of
exceptional charges.
The COB said the investigation was a routine procedure in cases of large
share price movements and announcements concerning large losses or
acquisition bids. It did not imply criticism of the company and was not to
be confused with the opening of a formal inquiry. The size of Euro Disney's
exceptional losses, which totalled FFr3.6bn, took the market by surprise and
increased the urgency of a capital restructuring at the group.
Yesterday, the share price fell sharply in Paris, closing down FFr5.5 at
FFr32.5. In London, where it suffered a steep decline on Thursday, when the
Paris market was closed, the company's shares rose 2p to 370p.
