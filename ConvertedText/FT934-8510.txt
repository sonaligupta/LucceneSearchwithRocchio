FT  15 NOV 93 / International Company News: CS Holding pays SFr416m to raise
stake in Bank Leu


   By IAN RODGER


   ZURICH


CS HOLDING, the parent company of the financial services group built around
Credit Suisse, has bought an additional 15 per cent stake in Bank Leu,
Switzerland's fourth largest bank, for SFr416m (Dollars 278m) in shares and
cash.
The move, which raises CS's holding in Leu to 70 per cent, is aimed at
strengthening its capital base and consolidating its position as
Switzerland's largest financial services group. CS said it also plans to
make a five-for-one share split
The Leu shares were bought from BK Vision, a specialised investment company
controlled by Mr Martin Ebner's BZ banking group, at the rate of one CS
share and SFr720 in cash for every six Leu shares.
At a stroke, this makes BK Vision, which is known for trying to influence
the management of companies in which it takes positions, one of the largest
shareholders in CS Holding with roughly 2 per cent.
It is already the largest shareholder in Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS),
with approximately 5 per cent of the equity worth some SFr1.5bn.
CS will make an offer this morning to the remaining Leu minority
shareholders on the same terms, which represent a 15 per cent premium over
Friday's closing price of SFr592 per Leu share.
CS acquired its current 54 per cent stake in Bank Leu through a hostile
takeover bid in 1990, ironically, beating out a competitive bid from the BZ
group.
Since then, the process of integrating the bank, which has both a large
international private clientele and a local commercial business in the
Zurich area, into the CS group has proceeded slowly.
