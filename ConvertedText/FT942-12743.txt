FT  28 APR 94 / People: Sweet taste in the mouth for Malik-Noor at Regina


Shiraz Malik-Noor yesterday completed his victorious return to power at
troubled royal jelly company Regina by being appointed chief executive;
Monday's extraordinary general meeting had put him back on the board.
Paul Geoghegan, the chairman who fought valiantly to keep Malik-Noor away
from the company at which he (Malik-Noor) is major shareholder, has stood
down.
He has been replaced by Guy Neely, a former finance director at Glaxo and
treasurer of the Mercers Company, who was voted onto the board at the
tumultuous EGM.
Malik-Noor had called another EGM in order to propose the removal of
Geoghegan and finance director Tony Shakesby from the board, but this has
been cancelled and Shakesby will remain.
