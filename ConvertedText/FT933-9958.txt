FT  06 AUG 93 / 'Better times' for slimmer BP


A STRONG gain in second quarter profits yesterday took British Petroleum a
step further to recovery from last year's heavy losses.
The group unveiled operating profits of Pounds 581m on a replacement cost
basis, which excludes the effect of changes in the value of oil inventories.
Last summer BP plunged deep into loss after making a charge of more than
Pounds 1bn following the ousting of its former chairman Mr Bob Horton.
Mr David Simon, the chief executive, said: 'It is no longer the worst of
times. It is not yet the best of times. But it is better times.'
The result was better than the market had been expecting and BP's shares
gained 2 1/2 p to 306p.
Much of the improvement came from the severe cost-cutting campaign
instituted by Mr Simon. Several thousand people have left the company, and
more than Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn) of assets have been sold so far this
year.
Among the group's operations, the refining and marketing side made the
strongest advance by more than trebling profits compared to last year. Oil
exploration and production was up over the first half as a whole. But the
chemicals business continued to suffer from the squeeze in margins,
recording a first half loss of Pounds 37m, including Pounds 24m of
restructuring charges.
Mr Simon said the group was still aiming to reach its target of Dollars 2bn
profit by 1995, along with capital spending of Dollars 5bn a year, and
annual debt repayment of Dollars 1bn. The improvement also meant that a
rights issue was unnecessary. But the returns being earned were still not
high enough, and it was too soon to increase the dividend.
