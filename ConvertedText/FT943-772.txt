Germany's banks came under fire from the country's main political parties
yesterday, and the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) pledged to clip their
wings if it wins the general election on October 16. Chancellor Helmut Kohl
said he took seriously the complaints of small companies that big banks were
too powerful, and his liberal Free Democrat (FDP) coalition partners said
bank representation on company boards should be limited. The comments were
made in written replies to questions submitted by the Federation of Small
and Medium-Sized Businesses, a lobby group representing 29,000 companies.
