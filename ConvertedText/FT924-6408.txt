FT  21 NOV 92 / BR halts Tilbury line upgrade


   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent


BRITISH RAIL has reversed a decision to spend Pounds 50m on the
re-signalling of the London Tilbury and Southend line, one of the country's
worst-performing railways.
Thousands of commuters had expected the re-signalling to end frequent
interruptions to services caused by breakdowns in the 60-year-old equipment.
BR blamed the move on the financial settlement imposed in the Autumn
Statement last week. It said it no longer had enough money to go ahead with
the project.
The scheme is one of several investment programmes BR has put on indefinite
hold. Others are the renewal of trains and track on the west coast main line
from London Euston; the replacement of the 40-year-old trains on the Kent
Coast routes; and implementation of the Thameslink 2000 project to improve
capacity of the north-south cross-London link.
In addition, BR said much of the routine renewal of the railway
infrastructure would give way to temporary repairs.
BR said safety would not be compromised by the cuts. On the London Tilbury
and Southend line, fail-safe devices meant equipment failures caused signals
to turn to red.
The Department of Transport said BR had been given as much money as the
government could afford in a tough spending round, and had been left Pounds
230m better off as a result of the settlement.
BR said the extra funds would be mopped up by the purchase of 188 Networker
trains which the government approved during the general election campaign
this year.
London Underground has set up a hot-line to provide managers with up-to-date
information on workers' support ahead of next week's Tube strike called by
the RMT rail union. The company is determined to run a strike-breaking
service from Tuesday but the RMT said: 'We are confident that our members
will support the strike call.'
