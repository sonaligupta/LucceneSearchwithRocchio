FT  19 APR 94 / S Korea and US agree hard line

The US will not hold new high-level discussions with North Korea unless it
accepts full international nuclear inspections by early May, US and South
Korean officials agreed yesterday.
South Korea meanwhile received its first shipment of Patriot missiles to
defend military bases against possible attacks by North Korean Scud
missiles. The missiles, which arrived in the port of Pusan, will be deployed
by the end of the month.
Mr Robert Gallucci, who heads the US policy group on North Korea, reaffirmed
the condition for talks with Pyongyang during a meeting in Seoul with Mr Kim
Sam-hoon, his South Korean counterpart.
North Korea has claimed direct talks with the US would solve the dispute
over nuclear inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Pyongyang is believed to be seeking US diplomatic recognition in return for
accepting inspections.
South Korea on Friday withdrew a demand for an exchange of envoys with North
Korea, clearing the way for renewed talks between Washington and Pyongyang.
The special envoys would have discussed inter-Korean nuclear inspections,
which would be more intrusive than those conducted by the IAEA.
The decision was meant to break a diplomatic impasse by separating
inter-Korean talks from US-North Korean negotiations. South Korea had
previously insisted the two sets of negotiations be conducted
simultaneously, but North Korea has refused to do so.
