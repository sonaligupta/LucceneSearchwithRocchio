FT  05 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei rises 1.8% in
volatile region

   TOKYO


Investors failed to react to the decision by the US government to reinstate
the Super 301 trade provision, and share prices gained ground on active
buying by arbitrageurs and investment trust funds, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average rose 360.14, or 1.8 per cent, to 19,966.00, up 0.8
per cent on the week, having fallen to a low of 19,627.96 in the morning and
peaking at 20,052.11 in the afternoon.
Investors, who had expected the yen to rise on the announcement of the
revival of Super 301, were relieved after the Bank of Japan's heavy yen
selling intervention kept the currency from rising against the dollar.
The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 19.96 to 1,622.29, while
the Nikkei 300 rose 3.98 to 299.30. Volume totalled 294m shares against
410m.
In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.39 to 1,341.11.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone rose Y30,000 to Y958,000, along with other
multi-media related stocks. NEC rose Y24 to Y1,020 and Sony gained Y120 to
Y6,180.
Arbitrage buying supported banks with Industrial Bank of Japan rising Y50 to
Y3,310 and Fuji Bank gaining Y30 to Y2,290. Brokerages were also firm, with
Nomura Securities up Y20 to Y2,290 and Daiwa Securities advancing Y50 to
Y1,730.
Hitachi, the day's most active issue, lost Y2 to Y925, posting its third
consecutive fall on profit-taking.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 260.63 to 22,069.16 in volume of 104.7m
shares. Roundup
There were a spread of performances among the region's markets yesterday.
HONG KONG remained volatile with the market again moving upwards, helped by
steadier activity overseas. The Hang Seng index gained 116.16 to 9,918.19,
down 1.8 per cent over the week.
Turnover fell to HKDollars 4.7bn from Thursday's HKDollars 5.3bn.
Domestic investors concentrated on property stocks, with the sub-index
improving 389.64 or 2.13 per cent, to 18,648.57. Investors are anticipating
strong results from property companies later this month.
SEOUL fell for the fourth consecutive session, the composite index shedding
5.61 to 896.55, a week's loss of 2.5 per cent. Turnover rose to Won459.4bn
against Thursday's Won429.4bn.
Export-oriented companies went against the trend: Samsung Electronic rose
Won100 to Won71,100 and Hyundai Motor Won600 to Won42,300.
TAIWAN firmed 3.9 per cent on reports that the central bank would raise the
Dollars 5bn ceiling on combined foreign investment in the market.
The weighted index rose 215.13 to 5,672.87, only marginally higher across
the week. Turnover was impressive at TDollars 73.1bn from Thursday's
TDollars 38.7bn. The financial sector climbed 6.3 per cent, while
electronics were favoured by foreign investors.
MANILA fell across the board, the composite index dipping 91.23 to 2,606.82
as turnover rose to 823.6m pesos from Thursday's 817.9m. The market has
fallen nearly 12 per cent since last Thursday - the market was closed on
Friday - with foreign institutional investors remaining absent and domestic
retail investors selling heavily.
PLDT lost 25 pesos to 1,865, after a drop of 50 cents to Dollars 66.75 on
overnight trading in New York.
AUSTRALIA retreated sharply on worries over a possible rise in US interest
rates. The All Ordinaries index dived 34.6 to 2,116.8, a week's loss of 1.5
per cent. The market is now at its lowest level since December 24 1993.
BOMBAY lost 4.4 per cent, partly in continued reaction to Monday's budget
and worries over falling prices of Indian global depositary receipts on
international markets. Brokers commented that this might stop foreign
institutional investors from buying in the Indian bourses. The BSE index
shed 175.07 to 3,806.65, bringing its fall since Monday, when budget
proposals were presented, to 11 per cent.
BANGKOK rose on strong buying of financial stocks. The SET index put on
18.87 to 1,359.25, off 4.2 per cent across the week. Turnover was Bt7.7bn.
