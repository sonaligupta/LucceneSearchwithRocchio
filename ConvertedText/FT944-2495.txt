FT  16 DEC 94 / Nigeria's government attempt to thwart illegal currency
dealings


   By MICHAEL HOLMAN, Africa Editor


In an unprecedented attempt to crack down on the country's black market in
foreign currency and reinforce its controversial exchange rate policy,
Nigeria's military government has made it an offence to disclose the street
value of the naira, Michael Holman, Africa Editor, writes.
In a decree issued last week, the authorities warned that to 'publish or
cause to be published exchange rates and interest rates other than that
approved by the Central Bank' would be an offence.
The penalty for individuals breaching the decree is a fine of N100,000
(Pounds 2,900 or Dollars 4,500) or two year imprisonment, or both.
In January the government pegged the foreign exchange rate at N22 to the
dollar and closed the secondary or parallel market which allowed investors
to bring in and change dollars at the open market rate, which was between
N45 and N50 earlier this year.
The government also capped bank lending rates at 21 per cent. Privately the
government admits the measures have failed, with inflation rising to more
than 100 per cent on an annual basis, and the market rate of the Naira
plunging from N50 to N100 between June and November this year as receipts
from the country's exports failed to keep up with the demand for foreign
currency.
