FT  06 JUN 92 / German refugee vote


   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES


   BONN


The German parliament is to speed the processing of asylum seekers and the
expulsion of non-political refugees, writes Christopher Parkes in Bonn.
Asylum hearings will be limited to six weeks, rights of appeal reduced and
'collection camps' set up for asylum-seekers. Almost 160,000 have arrived
this year.
Although the new asylum regulations will come into force on July 1, doubts
were immediately raised about their effectiveness.
The Bundestag also passed new rules on the taxation of unearned income,
which must overcome stern opposition in the upper house, the Bundesrat,
before they can come into effect. The opposition voted against changes
raising the tax-free threshold on interest income to DM6,000 (Pounds 2,060)
a year for individuals and DM12,000 for couples.
