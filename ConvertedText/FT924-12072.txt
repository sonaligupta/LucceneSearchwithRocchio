FT  22 OCT 92 / International Company News: Hurricane helps reduce Texaco
earnings by 6%

   NEW YORK


TEXACO, the US energy group, yesterday disclosed a 5.9 per cent decline in
third-quarter net earnings, which it attributed to costs associated with
property damage caused by Hurricane Andrew and debt-related expenses.
The drop - from Dollars 286m to Dollars 269m - translated into earnings per
share of 94 cents, down from Dollars 1.01 a year ago. But Texaco maintained
that without special charges its third-quarter 1992 net would have been
Dollars 1.10 a share, or Dollars 309m.
Revenues were 6.9 per cent higher at Dollars 10bn.
For the first nine months of 1992 net income dropped by 26.4 per cent to
Dollars 714m on revenues 2 per cent lower at Dollars 27.97bn.
Mr James Kinnear, chief executive, said the operational performance in the
quarter reflected benefits from better crude and natural gas prices, as well
as efforts to control expenses. These benefits, however, were dampened by
weak refinery margins in the US and in major international markets.
In operating terms, exploration and production earnings in the US were
Dollars 189m in the quarter, against Dollars 129m a year ago. Manufacturing
and marketing earnings were Dollars 87m, up from Dollars 82m last time.
Exploration and production operating income outside the US was Dollars 66m,
down from Dollars 89m in the third quarter of 1991. Non-US manufacturing and
marketing operating profits were also lower, at Dollars 86m against Dollars
118m a year ago.
Texaco's petrochemical losses in the third quarter were Dollars 8m, compared
with Dollars 3m earnings last year.
On Wall Street, Texaco's share price closed Dollars  1/4 higher at Dollars
62.
