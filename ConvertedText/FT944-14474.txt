FT  22 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Brewers


Shares in the UK's leading brewers held their ground this week in spite of
the fall in the overall market. This burst of out-performance reflected
hopes of a wave of mergers leading to rationalisation of the industry.
Rationalisation is clearly desirable. There is 25 per cent overcapacity in
the sector and price pressures are intense. Taking out capacity would give a
reduced number of brewers scope for improving margins. They would be able to
cut production and distribution costs and push through increased prices. An
opportunity for such a shake-up may present itself if Foster's Brewing Group
 -currently reviewing its commitment to the UK - decides that it should sell
Courage. Were Scottish & Newcastle to emerge as the buyer for the UK's
second-biggest brewer, as rumoured in the market, the move could prompt
Allied Domecq to extract itself from its Carlsberg-Tetley joint venture.
Such concentration would significantly boost the industry's profitability.
The government would be bound to look askance at any merger between S&N and
Courage, since the new entity would have a combined market share of 32 per
cent. But that does not mean they should shrink before even testing the
political water. A review of the competition regime, five years after the
introduction of the 'Beer Orders' limiting brewers' ownership of pubs, is
overdue. An S&N move on Courage would be a welcome catalyst to change in the
sector and oblige the government to take a fresh look at the broader
competition issues.
