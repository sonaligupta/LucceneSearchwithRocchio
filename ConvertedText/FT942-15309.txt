FT  15 APR 94 / International Company News: US insurer to sell two
businesses in shake-up


   By MARTIN DICKSON


Continental Corporation, the 12th largest property/casualty insurer in the
US, yesterday announced a restructuring of several business units, involving
a Dollars 45m pre-tax charge, and said it planned to sell two businesses:
Continental Canada and Casualty Insurance.
It expects to record a gain on the disposals. Mr John Mascotte, chairman,
said it was an opportune time to sell these 'highly-marketable, successful
and autonomous operations'.
The sales and restructuring would improve customer service and give
additional capital for growth in strategic businesses.
Continental Canada is the third largest writer of business insurance in
Canada and concentrates mostly on mid-sized companies. It wrote Dollars 333m
in premium last year and employed 740.
Casualty Insurance is the leading workers' compensation insurer in Illinois.
It wrote Dollars 362m in premium last year and employed 320.
Continental's reorganisation centres on the field claims operation of its
agency and brokerage division, which represents two thirds of its insurance
writings. The aim is to put more claims adjusters on the road and
consolidate back-office functions.
This, together with other restructuring moves, will cut 680 jobs from the
group's 12,255 workforce.
