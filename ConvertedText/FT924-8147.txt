FT  12 NOV 92 / The Matrix Churchill Scandal: Matrix director may sue
Customs


   By JOHN MASON


CUSTOMS MAY be sued for malicious prosecution following the collapse of the
Matrix Churchill trial. Mr Trevor Abraham, former Matrix commercial director
and one of three men cleared of illegally exporting machine tools to Iraq,
is considering bringing a prosecution, his solicitor Mr Nicholas Devine of
Blythe Liggins, said yesterday.
Mr Devine claimed that the trial had been brought by Customs in an attempt
to embarrass the Department of Trade.
It would be necessary to establish negligence or fraud to prove the
prosecution had been malicious, he said. 'It has been suggested from an
early stage that the whole thing was prompted by internecine strife between
Customs and the Department of Trade and Industry.
'A former DTI minister and three civil servants in his department were put
up on a stand to be shot at, embarrassed by cross-examination and made to
look foolish.'
He claimed Customs should have abandoned the case long before it went to
trial.
'There is certainly evidence which would suggest it should never have been
begun. Someone somewhere in Customs was in possession of all the facts, all
the details, all the evidence and must have known the case was ill-founded
and yet allowed it to proceed.'
Mr Devine said documents detailing the government's 'hidden agenda' of arms
sales to Iraq and awareness of the nature of Matrix Churchill lathes
contracts had been available to prosecutors at an early stage.
'These men were accused of misleading the DTI by prosecutors who must have
known there hadn't been any misleading,' he said.
