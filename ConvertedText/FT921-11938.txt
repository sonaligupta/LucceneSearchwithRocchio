FT  29 JAN 92 / Bank managers' judgment attacked


   By CHARLES BATCHELOR


BANK MANAGERS pay too much attention to narrow financial criteria and not
enough to factors such as management skills and technical knowledge when
assessing business proposals.
This was one of the conclusions of a survey of 30 managers in the West
Midlands carried out by researchers from Birmingham Polytechnic.
Presented with the same business proposal - a real plan for a company to
provide information technology services to quantity surveyors - half of the
managers turned it down while half were prepared to back it.
Bank managers gave disproportionate attention to the founders' ability to
provide security for a loan when assessing risk, the researchers said. They
concluded that managers were trained to be generalists and called for more
specialisation.
Most of the bank managers paid little attention to the business's plans to
recruit a director to handle information technology issues although this
would have been crucial to its success, the researchers said.
Reasons given for rejection included the fact that the venture was
undercapitalised, was too speculative, or was being launched at the wrong
time.
