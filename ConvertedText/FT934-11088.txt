FT  02 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: Ball denies resignation was
linked to US probe


   By PATRICK HARVERSON


MR George Ball, who has resigned as senior executive vice-president at Wall
Street brokers Smith Barney Shearson, denied that his departure was linked
to the US government's investigation of a scandal at Prudential Securities,
the firm he once led.
Prudential has agreed to pay at least Dollars 371m in fines and restitution
to clients who bought billions of dollars of high-risk property and energy
limited partnerships in the 1980s after they had been wrongly told by
Prudential brokers that they were low-risk investments.
Mr Ball was chief executive of Prudential, then known as Prudential-Bache,
between 1982 and 1991. Investigators are reported to be considering civil
proceedings against former Prudential executives.
Although reports said Mr Ball was ousted from his post at Smith Barney
because of concern that the firm's reputation would be harmed if such a
high-profile figure faced charges relating to the Prudential scandal, Smith
Barney said Mr Ball had informed them of his plans to leave several months
ago.
