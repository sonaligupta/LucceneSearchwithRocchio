FT  28 APR 94 / International Capital Markets: CBoT in Globex move

The Chicago Board of Trade is negotiating to extend its participation in
Globex, the electronic trading system, even as it explores alternatives for
after-hours trading.
The futures exchange, which earlier this month voted not to continue its
Globex partnership with Reuters, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Matif,
was due to drop off Globex trading screens today.
However, the CBoT and the CME are under pressure from their member-firms to
reach a compromise. The CBoT has said it would develop its own local
after-hours trading system, but it would not be available until late summer.
Globex customers hope at least to keep the CBoT on line until an alternative
is available. 'We'd love to see no time in the dark (for CBoT T-bonds),'
said Mr John Benjamin, a managing director of Smith Barney Shearson in
Chicago.
A statement issued jointly by the CME, Matif and Reuters late on Tuesday
said: 'At the request of the CBoT, (we) are prepared to offer an extension
of the period for listing the CBoT's instruments on Globex until May 20
1994. This offer is made in view of the overwhelming support for Globex by
members and customers and their desire for the CBoT to reverse its decision
to withdraw from Globex.' Mr Patrick Arbor, CBoT chairman, said the
extension had not been agreed upon. 'They've set a price tag (for the
extension) that we haven't agreed to,' he said.
