FT  12 APR 94 / Algeria's PM quits amid crisis

Algeria's president, Mr Liamine Zeroual, yesterday replaced his prime
minister after less than eight months in a surprise move which came as the
government took measures to put the economy back on course.
The resignation of Mr Redha Malek and his cabinet in favour of a team to be
led by Mr Mokdad Sifi, transport minister, came shortly after Algeria's
army-backed rulers undertook a steep devaluation of the dinar as part of an
agreement with the International Monetary Fund.
At the weekend the government sent a letter of intent to the IMF which will
pave the way for a Dollars 1bn (Pounds 678m) standby credit and economic
reforms. These are aimed at liberalising the economy which is increasingly
crippled by a debt-service ratio of over 100 per cent and a confrontation
between the army and supporters of radical Islam. Since Mr Malek took office
last August, Moslem fundamentalists have stepped up their violent campaign
with random attacks on foreigners.
Mr Sifi, aged 53, has served in high-ranking posts in the ministries of
commerce, public works and finance.
France yesterday pledged its support for Algeria's new economic measures,
while awaiting announcement of the composition of the new government.
'France has always said it is ready to play its part in helping the Algerian
people and we will continue in this direction,' Mr Richard Duque, the
foreign ministry spokesman, said yesterday.
In practical terms, this means France is holding open a largely unused
FFr6.3bn (Pounds 732m) credit line granted to Algeria last year. Some FFr5bn
of this is export-credit tied to the purchase of French goods, and should
help maintain Algeria's imports from France which would otherwise be
severely hit by the 40 per cent devaluation.
