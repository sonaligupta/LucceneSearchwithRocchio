FT  07 JAN 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool


Although there will ne no auction test of world wool values till next week,
the market in the UK and other consuming countries is coming back to life
after the holidays.  Deliveries are going out reasonably well, and there is
some buying interest from Continental Europe.  Prices in several currencies
are tending dearer because the US dollar has been a little stronger, and the
Australian dollar has improved against the US. With prices likely to tend
dearer even if wool is unchanged in dollar terms, precautionary covering is
indicated by some traders, and selling prices for wool tops are slightly
higher.
