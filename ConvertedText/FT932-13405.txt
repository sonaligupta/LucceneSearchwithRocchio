FT  23 APR 93 / Letter: Rail needs subsidy to compete


   From Prof RONALD DORE


Sir, Perhaps Mr Gill (Letters, April 20) does not leave his ivory car very
often to travel by rail. Surely he knows that no railway can compete with
road without subsidy from taxpayers - not even in Japan with its amazing
population densities. The amount of subsidy/debt depends in part on
political judgment of the externalities, of the social benefits a decent
rail service provides, and not just on efficiency. If you want measures of
the latter, how do British Rail and German Rail stack up on, say, passenger
miles per worker hour, investment as a proportion of turnover, average
vintage of rolling stock, proportion of trains on time?
