FT  24 NOV 92 / Controls on travel cover meet attack


   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent


TRADING STANDARDS off-icers, the travel industry and Labour launched an
immediate attack on package-travel regulations laid before parliament
yesterday.
Trading standards officers said they would be able to check that travel
companies had taken out insurance, as required by the regulations, but would
not be able to say whether the cover was sufficient to protect consumers.
The proposed regulations give travel companies three ways to ensure that
customers are protected against corporate collapse. Companies can be bonded
to an approved trade body, such as the Association of British Travel Agents
(Abta), for a percentage of turnover; they can insure against insolvency on
behalf of their customers; or they can hold pre-payments on trust.
Companies operating outside approved trade bodies will be monitored by
trading standards officers.
Baroness Denton, consumer affairs minister, said the regulations aimed to
protect package travellers 'without making the cost of holidays prohibitive
by imposing an unfair burden on the smaller operators'.
The Institute of Trading Standards Administration said: 'We're happy to go
along to see whether a company is covered or not. But it's not our job to
find out whether that cover is adequate. We believe that can only be done in
detail by accountants and actuaries.'
It said trading standards officers would have preferred a scheme under which
all travel companies would have to be licensed.
Abta said the government's failure to set up a central licensing authority
'will result in company failures next year, with red faces in Whitehall and
Westminster'.
