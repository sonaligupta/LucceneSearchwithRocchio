FT  09 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Corporate bonds


If investors really do intend to buy more bonds this year, it makes sense
for companies to seek debt market finance. Yesterday's issues from Tesco and
Southern Electric might thus be the start of another flood of UK corporate
sterling issues in 1992.
The signs are certainly propitious. Not only do utility companies have a
natural appetite for fixed rate borrowings, with their large capital
spending programmes. Low spreads over gilts also mean opportunistic
borrowers like Tesco can swap all - or in yesterday's case part - of the
proceeds into cheap floating rate debt. Companies worried about the
fickleness of today's commercial banking relationships may find even high
real fixed rates worth paying to extend their debt maturities.
Whether new issue volume will exceed last year's record, calculated by the
International Financing Review at Pounds 8.5bn, is another matter. A run of
poor profits and dividend cuts could yet undermine the investor appeal of
corporate bonds. Even so, the prospective volume gives the clearing banks
food for thought. With highly-rated customers securing long-term funds
elsewhere, the quality of their loan books suffers accordingly.
