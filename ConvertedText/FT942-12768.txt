FT  28 APR 94 / Labour completes Euro-manifesto


   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent


Labour yesterday put the finishing touches to a manifesto for the European
elections which endorses its commitment to a minimum wage but leaves working
hours to employers and unions.
Labour hopes the manifesto will destroy Tory claims that it is committed to
a 35-hour, four-day week and scrapping Britain's veto on legislation.
Officials said it was designed 'to put Britain at the heart of Europe, where
we can fight effectively for our interests instead of abandoning them as the
Tories have'.
The manifesto, drawn up by a committee led by Mr Neil Kinnock, the former
Labour leader, will be published at the beginning of the party's official
campaign, three weeks before the June 9 election.
Mr John Smith, the party leader, said much work had to be done to make the
case for a minimum wage, indicating that the manifesto would not bow to
leftwing demands for a precise figure.
The manifesto sets out Labour's commitment to the social chapter of the
Maastricht treaty on European Union, and repeats the party's support for
economic and monetary union, including a single currency.
It says that limits on working hours - proposed by the manifesto of the
European Socialist party, to which Labour is also committed - will be 'an
option' for negotiation between unions and employers.
A Labour government would insist on retaining Britain's veto on taxation,
budget, security and defence proposals, although it would allow majority
voting in the Council of Ministers on other matters, including social,
environmental and health issues.
