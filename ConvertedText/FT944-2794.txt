The company is to restructure its regulated business as a result of the
industry's price review, writes Roland Adburgham. The move is likely to
result in redundancies of about 10 per cent among its workforce of 600. The
industry regulator has set the company's K factor, which determines by how
much prices can rise above inflation, at 1 per cent for each of the next
five years. 'To ensure at least the matching of the efficiency criteria
underlying the determination, it will be necessary to take a number of
actions including a major internal restructuring programme,' said Sir John
Wills, chairman. The company reported a 15 per cent rise in pre-tax profits
to Pounds 4.73m (Pounds 4.12m) for the six months to September 30, helped by
a Pounds 700,000 profit from the sale of non-operational properties. The
interim dividend is 12p (11.1p); earnings per share were 49.2p (44.5p) basic
and 45.3p (39.9p) fully diluted. Turnover rose 4 per cent to Pounds 31.3m.
Operating profits were Pounds 6.55m (Pounds 6.4m), after a Pounds 1.1m
provision for costs of reorganising and reducing staff levels.
