FT  29 JUL 92 / Directors jailed for 'massive frauds'


TWO DIRECTORS of a computer company have been jailed for what a judge
described yesterday as 'frauds on a massive scale' against finance houses.
Mr Terence Harvey and Mr John King, directors of Computer Investment
Leasing, were sentenced to 18 months and 12 months respectively and
disqualified from being company directors for two years. They admitted
obtaining property by deception.
Judge Watts said at Southwark Crown Court, London, that well over Pounds 1m
had been extracted from finance houses, more than Pounds 700,000 of which
had been lost.
The prosecution said the company had once been a success, but with the
downturn in the leasing market in 1987 had faced substantial overheads. To
keep the company afloat Mr Harvey, of Hulcote, Milton Keynes, and Mr King,
of Putnoe Street, Bedford, had raised capital by making bogus leasing
agreements for new equipment, but had defaulted on repayments to finance
houses.
