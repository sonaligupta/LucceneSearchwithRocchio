FT  14 APR 94 / Recycling levy 'must fall on consumers'


   By BRONWEN MADDOX and JENNY LUESBY


Customers should bear much of the cost of schemes to recycle and recover
waste packaging, the packaging industry said yesterday in a strongly worded
statement.
In a statement at its annual lunch in London, the Packaging and Industrial
Films Association called for a levy on retailers to help pay for recycling
proposals.
Mr Robert Atkins, environment minister, told the industry gathering that if
it wanted to avoid 'detailed prescriptive legislation from government' on
recycling, it had to come up with its own proposals quickly.
Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, has called on the industry to find
ways of recycling between half and three-quarters of the UK's waste
packaging. Last year, the UK recycled less than a third of its 7.3m tonnes
of household and commercial waste packaging.
According to estimates published in February by an industry working group,
recycling or recovering half of waste packaging would add 1p to every Pounds
10 food shopping bill. Ambitious recycling targets could cost Pounds 100m to
implement, industry estimates suggest.
Ministers and industrialists are concerned that whatever the solution
devised in the UK, a new European packaging waste directive, to be voted on
soon by the European parliament, may impose additional expensive
obligations.
According to these plans, countries must recycle between 25 per cent and 45
per cent of packaging waste within five years of the directive coming into
force.
The Confederation of British Industry yesterday called for a levy to finance
recycling schemes to be raised 'as close as possible to the consumer'.
'If you place this levy early in the production chain it will affect
exports,' the employers organisation said.
