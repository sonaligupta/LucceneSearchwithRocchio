FT  20 APR 91 / EC partial membership suggested


   By DAVID BUCHAN


   BRUSSELS


THE European Community should consider partial membership for countries such
as those in eastern Europe which crave the political security of being in
the EC well in advance of being able to meet the economic test of EC
membership.
This concept of 'affiliate' membership was floated yesterday by Mr Frans
Andriessen, EC external affairs commissioner, in a speech in Brussels framed
mainly with eastern Europeans in mind but which could pertain to current
negotiations to create a European Economic Area (EEA) with members of the
European Free Trade Association (Efta).
He called for 'creative thinking to define arrangements whereby the
Community could offer the benefits of membership, and the accompanying
enhanced stability, without weakening its drive towards further integration
and without subjecting the fragile structure of new market economies to
excessive pressure.'
An 'affiliate' would have 'a seat at the Council of Ministers table on a par
with full members in specified areas', as well as representation in the
European Parliament, Mr Andriessen told Eurochambers, the association of EC
chambers of commerce.
