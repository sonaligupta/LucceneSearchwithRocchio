FT  29 JUL 92 / GPMU backs collective deals


   By DAVID GOODHART


STRONG preference for traditional UK collective bargaining in contrast with
the continental European system of works councils has been expressed by the
print union GPMU in a motion for this year's TUC Congress.
The GPMU motion also speaks out against European-level negotiations between
the European TUC and Unice, the European employers body. It says that if
European collective bargaining is developed, it should be done at sectoral
level.
Mr Tony Dubbins, leader of the GPMU, said: 'We don't want to end up with the
ETUC or the TUC starting to assume a collective bargaining role on behalf of
print workers.'
The motion challenges the increasingly Europhile consensus of several larger
unions, such as the GMB general union, and of the TUC itself. At last year's
Congress, a motion was passed praising the continental model of statutory
employee consultation and calling for an examination of how such practices
can be adapted to UK traditions.
In spite of the GPMU's assertion of 'traditional values' in UK industrial
relations - which is certain to fail at the Congress - the union has been
developing a very close working relationship with IG Druck, the German print
union.
Several GPMU officials have been on courses in Germany lasting five weeks
and a less numerous group is soon to embark on a four-month course,
including learning German.
The relationship between the unions is probably closer than the more
publicised alliance between the British AEU engineering union and the German
IG Metall, and Mr Dubbins said it was likely to become increasingly close.
The union has also benefitted from a Pounds 1.5m European Community grant to
the European Graphical Federation, the European grouping of print unions,
for a series of seminars to examine the strategies of Europe's printing
multinationals.
