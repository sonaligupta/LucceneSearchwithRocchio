FT  30 JUN 93 / International Company News: Kawasaki Steel blames loss on
Armco shake-up

KAWASAKI STEEL, the Japanese steelmaker, yesterday blamed a group loss of
Y30bn (Dollars 283m) on the restructuring of Armco Steel of the US, in which
it holds a 50 per cent stake, and on loan losses at a Japanese financial
subsidiary.
Kawasaki is still attempting to squeeze profits from Armco, in which it
acquired a stake in late 1988.
The acquisition was one of a series by Japanese steel-makers seeking to
enhance their US presence without increasing exports from Japan, which are
still a sensitive trade issue.
Group sales at Kawasaki slipped 5 per cent to Y1,310bn, while pre-tax profit
fell 69.7 per cent to Y16.1bn.
However, net profits were eroded by the company's half-share of a Dollars
460m loss at Armco, arising from the dismantling of old facilities and the
introduction of continuous casting equipment.
Another leading Japanese maker, Kobe Steel, reported a group loss of
Y14.3bn, which it said arose from weak domestic demand for steel and
machinery, and from about Y10bn in investment losses incurred by a leasing
subsidiary, Shinko Lease.
For the year ending in March, Kobe had reported a parent net profit of
Y11.76bn compared with a group net profit of Y27.25bn in the previous year.
Sales were down 8.3 per cent to Y1,334bn.
Japanese steel companies are attempting to clear the debris from the late
1980s, when some financial subsidiaries became active players on the stock
market, while others were part of the rush to lend to property developers.
Kobe Steel forecast a net profit of Y5bn for the current year, although the
continued weakening of the domestic economy could force a revision later in
the year.
The company is hoping for sales of between Y1,310bn and Y1,320bn, down
slightly on last year, but assisted by strong demand from China.
NKK, another Japanese steelmaker, reported a group net loss of Y4.45bn,
compared to a net profit of Y8bn in the previous period, and also said
profits were hurt by a Dollars 48m loss at its US steel acquisition,
National Steel.
Group sales were down 3.8 per cent to Y1,858.6bn.
