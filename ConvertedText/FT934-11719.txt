FT  29 OCT 93 / International Capital Markets: IFC helps finance Grupo Idesa
plants


   By ANTONIA SHARPE


THE International Finance Corporation (IFC), the private sector arm of the
World Bank, is providing a Dollars 57.5m syndicated loan to Grupo Idesa, a
Mexican petrochemicals company, to help finance the construction of two
plants at an estimated cost of Dollars 108m.
The IFC is also providing an equity investment of Dollars 8m. It has
approached DEG, the German finance company for investments in developing
countries, to put up an additional Dollars 7.5m as a separate loan.
The rest of the project's cost will be financed by Idesa's internal cash
generation. The plants should take between two and three years to build.
Idesa, one of Mexico's largest exporters of chemicals, will pay a spread of
between 2 1/4 and 2 1/2 per cent over the London interbank offered rate
(Libor). It will pay the banks participating in the loan through the IFC.
Of the IFC's total loan, Dollars 42.5m has been placed with a group of
banks, lead-managed by Dresdner Bank Luxembourg. The lead manager will earn
a front-end fee of 1 per cent and the managers will earn  3/4 per cent.
The syndicated tranche of the loan will have a maturity of seven years,
while the IFC's own-account loan will have a maturity of nine.
The IFC said environmental considerations weighed heavily in Idesa's
decision to locate its plants in an industrial park in Morales, in Veracruz,
next to the petrochemicals complex which will supply the raw materials. The
proximity will eliminate the need to transport hazardous chemicals over long
distances.
One of the plants will produce 200,000 tons per year of ethylene glycol,
used to make polyester fibres and resins for packing applications. The other
will produce 20,000 tons yearly of ethanolamines.
