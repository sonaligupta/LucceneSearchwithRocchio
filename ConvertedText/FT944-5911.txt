FT  01 DEC 94 / Observer: Post haste


Benazir Bhutto and Michael Heseltine were obsequiously congratulating each
other on their respective careers at Oxford University during their tete a
tete at the Confederation of British Industry yesterday.
The Brits seem to assume that flattery will get you everywhere and Bhutto
was, after all, the first foreign woman to become president of the Oxford
Union.
Feeling rather left out by all the talk of undergraduate days, John Major
eventually managed to butt in with a question for Bhutto as to whether she
had privatised her country's post office yet. 'I recommend it,' he threw in
mischievously.
'A little chat with an Oxford colleague will tell you all the advantages.'
