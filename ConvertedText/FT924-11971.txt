FT  23 OCT 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (19): Keep an eye on
your deposit if you rent through an agency - Living in someone else's house
means wear and tear is a constant worry


   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU


THE UK is overwhelmingly a property-owning society, with the private rental
sector accounting for only 7.4 per cent of the total housing stock.
But for a variety of reasons, many people are now becoming tenants.
Some foresee a prolonged period of low inflation and high real interest
rates, so that owning property may not be the good deal it was for much of
the 1980s. Others have sold their homes and are renting on a short-term
basis while looking for the right property to buy.
Once you have settled the economic arguments, the main drawback to renting
is that you are living in someone else's property. You are unlikely to be
able to redecorate the place to your taste, and if you have children (or
lots of parties) you will be constantly worried about wear and tear to the
property.
Until the 1988 Housing Act, it was arguably more desirable to be a tenant
than a landlord. But, as the accompanying article explains, the renting
sector shifted in favour of landlords once the Act had come into force on
January 15, 1989, doing away with protected tenancies for new tenants.
A landlord, instead of needing grounds for possession in order to evict a
tenant, can now evict them at two months' notice once the first six-month
period under the new assured shorthold tenancy is up.
Finding a property to rent
People usually find a flat or house through the classified columns, estate
agents or a letting agency.
The advantage of the last is convenience, though the drawback is that you
pay for the service. (If you find a property through an estate agent, the
person wishing to let it pays.)
The collapse of a number of letting agencies in the past few years has
highlighted the risk that tenants could lose their deposit. There are no
legal requirements, comparable to those required of solicitors or financial
advisers, for the holding of deposits in separate client accounts.
John Andrews was one of the lucky ones. He used the letting agency, Busy
Bees, to rent a flat in Finsbury Park, London, but was upset about the
amount of money extracted from him:
'They wanted one month's deposit, a six-week arrangement fee for finding the
place, and one month's rent in advance. I had to write out a cheque for near
on Pounds 1,000.'
Busy Bees went bust a year ago. Mr Andrews had already moved on and
recovered his deposit from the agency, but others lost the money they had
left with it.
Ensure that the letting or estate agent is a member of the Association of
Residential Letting Agents, or the National Association of Estate Agents.
The association gives guidelines to member firms, including the stipulation
that tenants' deposits be put in a separate account. You are entitled to
have this deposit returned to you with interest.
Do not pay a fee to a letting agency until it finds the place you are
renting - it is illegal for the agency to extract money from you before
then.
The tenancy agreement
If you rented on or after January 15, 1989, you will fall into one of three
categories of tenant:
1. Assured shorthold tenant. This is now the most common form of tenancy
arrangement. Your tenancy is for a fixed six-month period, during which you
cannot be evicted. At the end of the six months, the landlord can evict you
but has to give you two months notice.
2. Assured tenant: This gives you greater protection. You have a right to
stay for a fixed period of time unless the landlord has grounds for
possession - there are about 20 grounds. The rent can be assessed by the
landlord once a year.
3. Non-assured tenant: If you are neither of the above, you are likely to be
a non-assured tenant. People who have a resident landlord may not realise
that they fall into this category. Those who do not pay rent, or have a
company let, are also non-assured tenants.
You have few rights as a non-assured tenant, and could be given only four
weeks notice to leave, although your landlord would have to go to court to
evict you, according to Shelter.
Many people do not realise that a verbal agreement is just as legally
binding as a written agreement. 'In many cases it can be better,' said John
Goodwin, of Shelter, 'because a written agreement tends to have a lot of
exclusion clauses.' But take a friend who can act as a witness to back you
up if necessary.
If you sign a written agreement with your landlord, have it looked at by a
solicitor, the Citizen's Advice Bureau or a Housing/Law advice centre.
Moving in
You will be required to pay a deposit, usually equivalent to a month's rent.
You should certainly not agree to more than two months' rent unless your
tenancy is more than 21 months. Shelter's advice is that, when paying the
deposit, you get a written statement from the landlord, stating clearly how
much deposit has been paid and whether or not it is returnable. Also, get
the landlord to state what it could be used for, such as breakages or unpaid
rent.
If there is no inventory, take one yourself and get the landlord to sign it.
If you are presented with an inventory, carefully check all the items, and
if you notice defects on some items, tell the landlord - you do not want to
be told that the bath has to be replaced because you chipped it, when you
had noticed that it was chipped when you moved in.
Rents
The new Housing Act means that landlords can charge the market rent, rather
than a 'fair' rent as previously required. They can also review the rent
every year. Under the assured or assured shorthold tenancy, you are not
eligible to take an appeal for a fair rent to a Rent Office. If you think
you are being charged above market rent, you should contact the Rent
Assessment Committee or your local Citizen's Advice Bureau.
Problems
A common problem is a refusal by the landlord to pay for necessary
maintenance of the property. But since he is obliged to do structural
repairs and to ensure that the amenities are working, you can take him to
court.
The Small Claims Court will resolve disputes involving sums up to Pounds
1,000 for a small fee.
Another common problem is that the landlord withholds the deposit when you
move out, saying that it will be needed to clear up the mess you left
behind. A practical, but not strictly legal, way of anticipating this
problem is to withhold your final month's rent to offset against the
potential loss of the deposit.
