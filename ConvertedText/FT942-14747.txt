FT  19 APR 94 / Observer: No quibble


Anne Wibble, formidable chairman of the governors of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, was yesterday explaining the significance of
St Petersburg as the venue for this week's relaunch of the bank under
Jacques de Larosiere's stringent regime. It was, she said, 'a city founded
in another reform era of watershed proportions during the reign of Peter the
First'. On marshland which he had won by conquest from her native Sweden,
she diplomatically omitted to add.
The conference audience, which included Viktor Chernomyrdin, prime minister
and possible successor to Boris Yeltsin, later had the benefit of her views
on the dangers of slow-paced reform. 'The gradualist approach can easily
lead to a vicious circle of generalised subsidies to non-viable activities,
continuous budget deficits, prolonged high inflation, falling exchange
rates, capital flight and economic stagnation.' On the subject of the
political costs to the likes of Chernomyrdin in the alternative tough-it-out
approach, she again chose to play stumm.
