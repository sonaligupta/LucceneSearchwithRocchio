FT  05 JUN 92 / Rivers watchdog sees improvement


THE National Rivers Authority said yesterday that there was an 'underlying
trend of real and sustained improvement' in the quality of bathing waters.
That is in spite of a fall in the number of beaches reaching European
Community standards last year.
The NRA's second annual report on bathing water found that 312 out of 414
beaches, or 75.4 per cent, complied with EC standards. That was down from
78.1 per cent in 1990 .
