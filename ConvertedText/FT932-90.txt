FT  30 JUN 93 / UK Company News: MS Intl moves ahead to Pounds 460,000


MS International, the Doncaster-based engineer, lifted pre-tax profits to
Pounds 460,000 for the 12 months to May 1.
The outcome, on turnover of Pounds 28.8m (Pounds 30.5m), compared with
Pounds 251,000 last time, or a deficit of Pounds 1.52m restated for FRS 3.
At the operating level, profits jumped 90 per cent, from Pounds 330,000 to
Pounds 626,000. Mr Michael Bell, chairman, said the increase was achieved
despite the lack of recovery in the group's markets. 'There remained a
distinct reticence by customers to commit for capital projects', he said.
Net cash balances of Pounds 430,000 at the year end compared with borrowings
last time of Pounds 780,000.
Earnings per share emerged at 1p (losses of 5.5p under FRS 3) but the
proposed final dividend is held at 1.5p to maintain the total for the year
at 2.5p.
