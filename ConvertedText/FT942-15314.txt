FT  15 APR 94 / International Company News: New HK company data service


   By SIMON HOLBERTON


   HONG KONG


Extel Financial, a subsidiary of the Financial Times Group, and Wardley Data
Services have announced plans for a company research service offering data
about Hong Kong-listed companies on CD-Rom.
Wardley Data, a subsidiary of HSBC's Wardley merchant bank group, provides
the most widely-used system for accessing information about Hong Kong
companies. This paper-based product is updated regularly.
The new product, Wardley Extel Workstation, will provide information on all
listed companies in Hong Kong, as well as in Singapore, Malaysia and
Thailand. Indonesia would soon be added. All data is updated weekly on a
fresh disc.
The workstation runs on any IBM-compatible personal computer. Extel and
Wardley said it provided a powerful data search and retrieval capability.
They said the service, offering information about more than 10,000 listed
companies, would be the most extensive corporate data package in Hong Kong.
Extel will gain access to Wardley's customer base of between 300 and 400
users. It expects the hard-copy service will be phased out within three or
four years.
