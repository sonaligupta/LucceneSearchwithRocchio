FT  27 SEP 94 / Warning over costs of building new N-plants


   By MICHAEL SMITH and DAVID LASCELLES


Proceeds from the privatisation of Nuclear Electric, the state power
company, would be as much as Pounds 7.2bn less if the company was committed
to building new power plants, says an analysis published yesterday.
Cola, a consortium of local authorities opposed to new nuclear-plant
construction, says Nuclear Electric has substantially underestimated the
government support required for investment in new plant.
Support for Sizewell C, on the Suffolk coast, could amount to Pounds 4.5bn
and another station at Hinkley Point in Somerset would add more, Cola says.
'Government support on such a scale cannot be justified, because nuclear
power stations do not provide strong net environmental and strategic
benefits,' it says.
In a study commissioned by Cola, Mr Gordon MacKerron, senior research fellow
at Sussex University, forecasts that the capital cost of building Sizewell C
is likely to be Pounds 4bn to Pounds 4.6bn, compared with Nuclear Electric's
estimate of slightly more than Pounds 3.5bn. Nuclear Electric and Scottish
Nuclear should be privatised, not as specialist nuclear companies but as
companies with power generation as their main business, says the Institute
of Economic Affairs.
In a submission to the government's nuclear review, the free-market
think-tank says the companies should be allowed to diversify into other
lines of business, as far as shareholders and the competition authorities
permit.
