FT  22 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses shiver as US T-bond
yield tops 8%


   By Our Markets Staff


As the yield on US T-bonds went over 8 per cent again yesterday, bourses
shivered and Mr Albert Edwards at Kleinwort Benson said that the US economy
was growing 'way out of control', writes Our Markets Staff.
US inflation was only at mid-trend after its rise from zero to over 3 per
cent so far this year, Mr Edwards maintained; the yield on treasuries could
rise sharply in the near term, he said, and European financial markets
remained vulnerable.
FRANKFURT analysts made some attempts to relate share price movements to the
economic fundamentals - an M3 growth rate slightly above expectations, the
weak dollar and its effect on export margins - but this was mostly talk, as
chemicals and financials moved back to the forefront in the sector rotation
process.
The Dax index fell 47.73 to 2,022.22 on the session, down 4 per cent over
five days after a 7.3 per cent rise in the previous week. In the
post-bourse, the Ibis-indicated Dax hit 2,007.19 before closing 35.55, or
1.5 per cent low at 2,016.606. Turnover fell from DM7.4bn to DM7bn.
Big post-bourse losers included Allianz, Deutsche Bank and Bayernhypo in
financials, and BASF and Hoechst in chemicals, all with falls in the 2 to 3
per cent range.
PARIS closed a disappointing week with a further fall as the market was
depressed by German and US data, which led some institutional investors to
fear that further interest rate rises could be imminent. The CAC-40 index
finished down 25.28 at 1,842.09, off 4.7 per cent on the week.
Generale des Eaux lost FFr21, or nearly 5 per cent, to FFr425 as investors
reacted with disappointment to its 5 per cent rise in first half profits,
while Eurotunnel, which had suffered from negative publicity following
breakdowns of its Eurostar trains, put on FFr1.55 to FFr17.55 on
bargain-hunting.
AMSTERDAM had options volatility to contend with along with outside
influences that beset the continent in general. The AEX index finished down
3.52 at 399.85, after a low of 397, for a loss on the week of 2.2 per cent.
Nedlloyd was among the worst performers on the day, off 4 per cent at Fl
48.90, following news that the EU commission had blocked an agreement
between 15 shipping companies in transatlantic container trade. Analysts
said that this would mean that shipping rates would come down, with a
consequent effect on company earnings.
Gist-Brocades, the consumer goods group, lost 50 cents to Fl 44.40, in line
with the market trend, and in spite of an upgrade by James Capel. The broker
put out a buy note following the company's announcement at the end of
September that it was to get out of the US yeast market, in which it had
been fighting a losing battle with domestic producers since 1988. This, said
Capel, was a brave decision and meant that the group could concentrate on
pursuing its interests in growth markets, particularly in emerging economies
such as India, Egypt and Mexico.
ZURICH continued the retreat that has taken the market 3.0 lower over the
week in a consolidation after last week's gains and in the face of the weak
dollar. The SMI index fell 22.3 to 2,508.6, prompting the expectation that
next week could see it around the 2,480 level at which it found support
during early July and at the start of this month.
The banking sector continued lower, with UBS bearers down another SFr6 to
SFr1,139 and CS Holding losing SFr9 to SFr529.
Hoare Govett recommended a switch from UBS to the relatively weak CS Holding
which it saw as a fundamentally undervalued, high quality investment with
very positive earnings growth prospects.
Roche certificates lost SFr85 to SFr5,590, taking their loss over the week
to 5.9 per cent following the mine month figures on Monday.
MILAN was again depressed by speculative selling of Fiat and the Comit index
lost 1.49 to 617.49, taking the week's loss to 2.7 per cent.
UBS commented that domestic institutions were still reported to be
overweight in Italy and serious buying was unlikely until the BCI index
approached the 580 level. Foreign investors were staying well away and were
unlikely to return until the political scene became brighter.
Fiat finished L50 easier at L6,030, having picked up from a day's low of
L6,030.
