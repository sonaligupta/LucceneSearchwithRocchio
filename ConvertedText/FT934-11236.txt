FT  02 NOV 93 / Male managers 'block progress for women'


   By RICHARD DONKIN


A SIEGE mentality among male junior and middle managers is continuing to
block the progress of women in the workplace, a leading campaigner for
women's employment rights said yesterday.
Lady Howe, chairman of Opportunity 2000, the Business in the Community
initiative, told the organisation's second anniversary celebrations that
lack of awareness among men in lower management turned them unwittingly into
'benign saboteurs'.
She was backed by Ms Kay Struth of the surveyor-personnel management unit at
Customs and Excise, who said: 'There are some men who do not want to accept
that women can be equal in some areas.'
Mr David Sainsbury, chairman and chief executive of supermarket group J.
Sainsbury and a founder member of Opportunity 2000, said his company had not
felt a backlash from promoting career opportunities for women.
'It makes commercial sense to encourage women to progress to higher
management positions,' he said. 'For every woman at section manager level
who leaves because her wish for development is frustrated, we estimate it
costs us Pounds 5,000 to find and train a new recruit to the same standard.
For store managers and their deputies the figure is nearer Pounds 10,000. No
business can afford this level of waste.'
Lady Howe said the campaign's membership had doubled to 216 in the past
year. She said members were beginning to change their employment cultures,
bringing greater opportunities for women.
As examples of good practice she cited part-time working opportunities
introduced this year by the Metropolitan Police, a personal development
programme for women at clerical level at Barclays Bank, and senior
job-sharing at British Airways.
She said more than a third of the campaign's members had said that the
recession had restricted their scope to alter the balance of their
workforce.
