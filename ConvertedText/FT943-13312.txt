FT  20 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Standard Chartered


Standard Chartered is no exception to the rule that any bank which chooses
to focus on emerging markets is likely to run high risks as well as reap
high rewards. That much is inevitably reflected in its share rating, but the
art for a management trying to improve that rating is to minimise the risks
without foregoing the rewards. If its dismissal of two employees at Mocatta
is evidence of a stronger management grip, then it should be welcome. So
should the appointment of Mr John McFarlane to Hong Kong, where he will run
the markets business.
But investors would delude themselves if they assumed that all emerging
market risk could be eliminated in this way. Nor will Standard find the
going easy. Its reputation with its customers as well as investors will
suffer if it is continually forced to wash its dirty linen in public. Mr
McFarlane says Standard will eschew business that compromises the bank's
high ethical standards. That is laudable, but it could also be a handicap to
apply rigorous Western standards in markets with different customs and
traditions.
Nor can the discipline be confined to operational risk. Standard's recent
accounts have been remarkable for the low level of bad debt provisions in
the Asia Pacific region - only Pounds 48m on total assets of Pounds 23bn
last year. Whether this proves sufficient when the region's economy turns
down will be another test of management grip.
