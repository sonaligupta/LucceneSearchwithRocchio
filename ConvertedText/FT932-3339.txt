FT  15 JUN 93 / Foden expands workforce by 20%


   By JOHN GRIFFITHS


FODEN, the Cheshire-based truckmaker owned by Paccar of the US, has
recruited 80 additional employees to cope with what it describes as sharply
rising demand for its vehicles in the UK.
The move, which increases Foden's workforce by 20 per cent to 480, provides
another tentative sign that the UK truck market is starting to recover from
its most severe recession since the second world war.
But Iveco-Ford, the UK market leader, remains pessimistic about the outlook
for the truck market this year. It said yesterday it expected 1993 sales of
all trucks to be virtually the same as last year's 32,000.
The company said: 'We do expect an upturn in the final quarter of this year,
but have absolutely no thoughts about expanding the workforce.'
Iveco-Ford said yesterday it had added three more dealer outlets to five
formerly contracted to rival Leyland Daf.
Mr Rod Heather, Foden's managing director, said yesterday that orders for
some types of vehicles it produces were up more than 40 per cent compared
with last year.
Foden, however, is a small supplier in the UK truck industry, now producing
about four trucks a day, although it has capacity to produce 10.
It is being cautious about its expansion, and the additional workers it has
hired have only temporary status. Permanent employment terms are expected to
be offered only if it becomes clear that the recovery can be sustained.
Most of the truck industry has continued to shed jobs since the UK
commercial vehicle market first plunged at the end of 1989.
