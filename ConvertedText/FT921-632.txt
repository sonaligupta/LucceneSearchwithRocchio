FT  28 MAR 92 / Books: New life for Biography


   By J D F JONES


CONCISE DICTIONARY OF NATIONAL BIOGRAPHY Oxford Pounds 95 (Pounds 125 after
June 1), three volumes boxed
OXFORD University Press recently announced that the Dictionary of National
Biography is to be 'revised' in what will apparently be a root-and-branch
job; it will take ten years.
In the meantime, the Press has issued a rearranged three-volume summary of
the much-loved Dictionary, covering the whole period up to 1985. The
inevitable problem, as with the earlier Concise version, is that the need to
reduce each entry very savagely - the average entry is one-fourteenth of the
original - effectively deletes the elegance and charm which are among the
delights of the 31-volume full edition, in addition to truncating the detail
to a point where this Concise DNB becomes no more than a comprehensive
reference book.
