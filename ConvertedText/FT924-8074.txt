FT  13 NOV 92 / Ukraine coupon replaces rouble

UKRAINE said yesterday it was abandoning the rouble at midnight last night,
replacing it with coupons as a stepping stone to introducing a new currency.
Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the republic's president, announced that 'the rouble
should cease to circulate in Ukraine' from midnight and that it would cease
to be legal tender in Ukraine. A new currency coupon, called the
karbovanets, will be introduced for all transactions from today.
A government order said accounts in Ukrainian banks would be transferred
from roubles to karbovanets coupons.
Holders of roubles were ordered to exchange them for karbovanets within
three days in unlimited quantities at an exchange rate of one karbovanets
coupon per rouble.
Ukraine announced soon after the collapse of the Soviet Union last year that
it would leave the 'rouble zone.' It introduced coupons early this year, but
the rouble stayed legal tender for accounting.
The move to the karbovanets appears to be a half-way house between the
rouble and a new Ukrainian currency, to be called the grivna. Mr Leonid
Kuchma, the new Ukrainian prime minister, said on television this week that
introduction of the grivna would have to wait for the establishment of a
stabilisation fund, and for economic reform.
The karbovanets represents a step back for the Ukrainian leadership, which
had until recently talked of the imminent introduction of a full-blooded
independent currency. Since his appointment Mr Kuchma has taken a sharply
different line from Mr Kravchuk in calling for closer co-operation with
Russia and has repeatedly called attention to Ukraine's weakening economy.
