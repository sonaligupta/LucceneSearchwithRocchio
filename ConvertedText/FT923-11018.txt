FT  27 JUL 92 / Sunday racing gets off to a flying start


   By CHRIS TIGHE


PRESSURE ON the government to revise the web of laws which constrain
commercial activity on the sabbath in Britain increased yesterday when more
than 20,000 people attended the country's first Sunday horse race meeting at
Doncaster.
Shetland pony races, brass bands, a fashion show, a Scud missile display,
children's games and a parade by former racing favourites, including Red Rum
and Desert Orchid, contributed to a carnival atmosphere.
The racing, in which jockeys Lester Piggot, Willie Carson and Steve Cauthen
took part, produced some exciting finishes too.
The course management, selected by the Jockey Club to stage the event, was
able to charge admission without breaking the 1780 Sunday Observance Act by
laying on musical entertainment. But the 1963 Betting, Gaming and Lotteries
Act explicitly bars on-course Sunday betting, and so all betting at the
track was banned - a move enforced by surveillance and an undercover police
operation.
Anyone at the course wanting to bet had to telephone off-track to bookmakers
or the Tote.
The Horse Race Totalisator Board said the afternoon's seven races generated
Pounds 117,000 in bets to the Tote, mostly from people telephoning from
home. A comparable non-Sunday event at Doncaster would, he said, have
resulted in bets of about Pounds 200,000. Most of yesterday's crowd seemed
content, or at least resigned, not to bet. The bookies' area was turned over
to children's entertainments.
The Doncaster management, which had budgeted for a 17,000-strong crowd, was
delighted with the attendance and the good-natured atmosphere.
In a small nod to Sabbatarians, a short service was held at noon with
prayers and communal singing of Abide with Me.
