FT  13 APR 92 / People: Plum job at O&M


The top of the advertising tree is still largely dominated by men, but the
Texan-born Charlotte Beers, 56, has bucked that trend by taking one of the
industry's plum jobs as chairman of Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide, part of the
WPP marketing services group.
Beers - a graduate in maths and physics  - has one of the most impressive
track records in US advertising. In 1987 she became the first - and as yet
only  - woman to chair the American Association of Advertising Agencies.
Before joining O&M she spent ten years as chief executive of Chicago-based
Tatham, part of the Paris-based Euro RSCG group, the world's sixth largest
advertising group. In her stint there Tatham quad-rupled its billings.
Beers takes over from Graham Phillips, 53, who after 27 years with O&M is to
take a rather more back seat as vice chairman. Martin Sorrell, WPP's chief
executive, stresses the smoothness of the transition - Phillips himself
sought out Beers to head up the agency, which has billings of some Dollars
5.4bn annually.
Beers says she is 'elated to be working rather than be the subject of so
much press speculation' as to which agency she would be joining. She picked
out O&M because 'I've always had an image of O&M as the best brand of
agency. Another attractive aspect is that there has been such a natural
transition, with Graham still being there in support.'
