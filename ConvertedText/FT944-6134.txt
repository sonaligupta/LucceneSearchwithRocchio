FT  30 NOV 94 / International Company News: American General in talks to buy
Franklin Life


   By RICHARD WATERS


   NEW YORK


American General, the Houston-based life insurance group, is in talks to buy
Franklin Life, a subsidiary of American Brands, in a deal understood to be
valued at about Dollars 1.2bn.
The deal could be the first in a series of acquisitions by American General,
which last month outlined a plan to double its market capitalisation by the
end of the decade.
Mr Harold Hook, chairman, said the company, which is currently valued at
Dollars 6bn and has total assets of Dollars 44bn, planned 'two or three'
significant acquisitions.
American General is already locked in a hostile Dollars 2.6bn all-cash bid
for Unitrin, another US life company.
The proposed purchase price for Franklin - which neither company would
comment on, but which was confirmed by one person close to the deal - would
value Franklin at slightly less than its book value, which stood at Dollars
1.3bn at the end of 1993. At this level, the deal would be very attractive
to American General, said Ms Margaret Alexandre, an insurance analyst at
Salomon Brothers. Other insurance companies have generally been sold at
between 0.9 and 1.5 times book value.
Franklin, with assets at the end of 1993 of Dollars 7.1bn and operating
profits last year of Dollars 228m, is among the most profitable and
best-capitalised companies in the industry.
At nearly 13 per cent at the end of last year, its capital/assets ratio was
ahead of most competitors, according to Mr Patrick Finnegan of Moody's, the
US rating agency. The average ratio for the life companies tracked by
Moody's was 8.8 per cent.
If successful, American General is expected to use some of Franklin's extra
capital to reduce the purchase price of the deal. This echoes its plan to
take capital out of Unitrin, which is also heavily-capitalised by industry
standards.
