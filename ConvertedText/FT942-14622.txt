FT  19 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Eastern Elec. firm


   By PETER JOHN, CHRIS PRICE, CHRISTINE BUCKLEY and STEVE THOMPSON.


Eastern Electricity was one of only a handful of FT-SE 100 constituents to
make any substantial progress yesterday, the shares advancing strongly to
close 8 1/2 higher at 656p following turnover of 4.7m.
The rise came as the company paid a big premium to complete its share
buy-back programme. Yesterday Eastern bought 4.1m shares at 675p a share .
Eastern received shareholder approval to embark on a share buyback programme
involving 13.5m shares last August. Yesterday's deal produced an average
buyback price of 553p a share for the whole re-purchase programme.
Other regional electricity stocks made good progress at the outset of
trading, helped by ongoing speculation that the whole of the electricity
distribution and generation sectors may benefit from increasing speculation
of potential stake-building and merger activity which could take place
before the Government's golden shares in the companies disappear in March
1995.
Also helping to drive the sector was a story that the National Grid, owned
by the 12 'recs' was being prepared for a public flotation next year.
