FT  20 APR 94 / Arts: New secretary for Arts Council


Former actress Mary Allen has been appointed secretary-general of the Arts
Council. She replaces Anthony Everitt, who resigned as secretary-general in
February after the debacle over the funding of Lon-don's orchestras. Allen
has been the council's deputy secretary-general since 1992.
Announcing the appointment yesterday, Lord Gowrie, who recently succeeded
Lord Palumbo as chairman, said: 'We were all agreed that the strongest and
most resolute candidate, Mary Allen, should carry the day.'
Allen, who once starred in the Rocky Horror Show in the West End of London,
said: 'We have tough choices ahead. But all of us are whole-heartedly
committed to serving the arts, one of the strongest components of our
national life.'
