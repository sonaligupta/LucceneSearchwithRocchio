FT  17 JAN 92 / Property problems increase losses at NatWest Bancorp


   By ALAN FRIEDMAN


   NEW YORK


NATIONAL Westminster Bancorp, the wholly-owned US subsidiary of Britain's
National Westminster Bank, yesterday revealed a Dollars 371.5m (Pounds 207m)
loss for 1991, up from Dollars 352m in 1990.
The 1991 loss, struck after Dollars 567.7m of loan write-offs and Dollars
689.5m of bad debt provisions, was in large part the result of property
problems caused by NatWest's high lending to New York developers in the late
1980s.
Mr John Tugwell, the NatWest main board member who took charge of the New
York subsidiary last April in the wake of huge property loan losses,
yesterday said the fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 29.8m was significantly
lower than losses earlier in the year. He said the US bank is now trading
profitably and will be in the black in its first quarter.
He also noted that operating expenses last year were only slightly higher
(Dollars 790.8m compared with Dollars 746m) and the Dollars 88m bad debt
provisions in the fourth quarter were below the Dollars 292.6m of the last
quarter of 1990.
Mr Tugwell acknowledged that the Dollars 859.5m of cumulative losses since
1989 were high. But he argued that 'the pain has been taken and there is a
silver lining in that all thoses losses are tax credits which will mean we
won't pay any tax for some time'.
NatWest injected Dollars 450m into its troubled US operation last year as
loan loss problems mounted. Mr Tugwell stressed that non-performing loans at
year-end totalled Dollars 1.15bn, down from Dollars 1.3bn at the end of last
September. That means 8.16 per cent of the bank's total loan book is
non-performing. About 50 per cent of the non-performing loans is in
property. This means some 30.6 per cent of NatWest Bancorp's total property
loan book of Dollars 1.8bn is now non-performing.
Mr Tugwell stressed that the bank's core capital-to-assets ratio of 6.33 per
cent is strong compared with most US banks and claimed the ability to
improve operating profits while absorbing the impact of property problems
shows the bank's strength. Net interest income in 1991 was Dollars 706.8m,
down from Dollars 737.5m in 1990. Non-interest income rose to Dollars 283.9m
from Dollars 243.6m.
