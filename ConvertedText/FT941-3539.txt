The US has informed Japan it is considering claiming damages against
Japanese construction companies which allegedly fixed contracts to build a
US navy base in Japan, government officials acknowledged yesterday, writes
Michiyo Nakamoto in Tokyo.
Mr Kozo Igarashi, minister of construction, said the ministry will
investigate US allegations that 73 Japanese contractors conspired to fix
contracts to build the US navy's Atsugi Base between 1984 and 1990 and
charged inflated prices for their work.
The US has informed Japan's foreign affairs ministry that it is preparing to
seek damages of Y1.1bn (Pounds 7m) against the Japanese contractors, Mr
Igarashi said yesterday. 'As the ministry which oversees and instructs the
industry, we will look into the matter and deal with it appropriately,' the
minister said.
