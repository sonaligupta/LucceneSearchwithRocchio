second quarter


   By ROBERT GIBBENS

IMASCO, the Canadian tobacco, financial services, fastfood and retailing
group, continued strong profit growth in the second quarter, despite the
persistent North American recession.
Imasco, 40 per cent owned by BAT Industries of the UK, reported net profits
for the June quarter of CDollars 94.6m (USDollars 78.8m) or 73 cents a
share, up 11 per cent from CDollars 85.5m or 66 cents a year earlier.
Revenues advanced 2 per cent to CDollars 2bn.
First-half earnings rose 15 per cent to CDollars 158.2m or CDollars 1.21 a
share, from CDollars 137.4m or CDollars 1.04 a share, on little-changed
revenues of CDollars 3.9bn.
The biggest gain came in tobacco products. Imperial Tobacco lifted its
domestic cigarette market share to 64.2 per cent, up 3.7 percentage points.
Canada Trust, the financial services arm, increased net profits by 3 per
cent in the second quarter and 11 per cent in the first half. Drug stores
raised profits by 10 per cent in both periods, despite Canada's weak retail
environment.
Hardee's, the US fast-food subsidiary, suffered an 18 per cent fall in
first-half profits, but new marketing efforts were 'encouraging.'
