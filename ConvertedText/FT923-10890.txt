FT  28 JUL 92 / Anti-Mafia investigator shot dead


   By AGENCIES


   CATANIA


GUNMEN riding a pair of motorcycles killed an anti-Mafia police investigator
last night as he drove home from work, Agencies report from Catania. The
attack appeared to defy a big government crackdown on the Mafia.
Inspector Giovanni Lizzio, 46, was shot in the head and chest as he drove
alone in Catania, Sicily's second largest city. He was dead by the time he
reached hospital.
The inspector was killed eight days after top anti-Mafia judge Paolo
Borsellino and his five escorts were killed by a car bomb in the Sicilian
capital, Palermo. Italian state television said Insp Lizzio led Catania's
investigation into widespread Mafia extortion of eastern Sicilian merchants
and businessmen.
The government has sent thousands of troops to the island in an attempt to
curb Mafia activity there.
