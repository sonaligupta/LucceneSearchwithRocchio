FT  08 NOV 94 / People: Myring quits


David Myring is to leave his job as finance director of SWALEC, the regional
electricity company for South Wales next summer. When appointed in 1988 he
was the first rec finance director to be appointed from outside the industry
in the run-up to privatisation. An Oxford graduate, he had worked in the oil
industry heading up the commercial division of Britoil, now part of BP.
Myring, 52, has told the company he is not intending to take up full-time
employment elsewhere; 1995 'seems an appropriate time for me to bow out,' he
said.
As Myring has elected to step down he will not be entitled to compensation.
However, before he goes, he will be able to take options on 35,000 shares at
451p. At yesterday's price of 820p this would give him a gross profit of
about Pounds 130,000 if he chose to sell them.
Options on another 15,000 shares will elapse because he will leave before he
becomes entitled to buy them.
