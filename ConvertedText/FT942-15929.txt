FT  13 APR 94 / Plan to cut coal jobs withdrawn


British Coal last night withdrew plans to cut hundreds of pit jobs because
of 'speculation' about the number of miners to be made redundant.
The corporation had warned union leaders at a meeting near Mansfield,
Nottinghamshire, that up to 800 jobs could go at four pits over the next
year. Pits at Harworth near Worksop, Thoresby near Mansfield, Bilsthorpe
near Newark, all in Nottinghamshire, and Daw Mill in Warwickshire were
likely to be hit, union officials were told.
