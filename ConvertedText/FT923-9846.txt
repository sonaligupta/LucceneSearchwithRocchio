FT  03 AUG 92 / Letter: What ICI's accounting really says


   From Prof D R MYDDELTON


Sir, Proposals for radical restructuring of ICI are certainly overdue ('ICI
sets out radical plan to split its operations', July 31). After proper
allowance for inflation, the results over the last 20 or 30 years have been
truly awful.
In real terms the dividend is lower than it was in 1979, before the famous
nominal cut in the 1980 dividend. Indeed, in real terms ICI's dividend per
share is lower than it was as long ago as 1959.
Even more shocking is that ICI's historical cost accounts significantly
understate depreciation of fixed assets. Using constant purchasing power
accounting to allow for the effects of inflation, I reckon ICI has actually
made a real loss in ten of the last 15 years.
And according to my calculations, real CPP earnings have not fully covered
ICI's dividend in any single one of the past 17 years.
This is an indictment of ICI's performance. It is, however, also a sad
commentary on the state of UK accounting.
