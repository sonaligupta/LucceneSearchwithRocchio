FT  06 NOV 93 / Warning over new ways of working


   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff


BRITAIN is poorly placed to take advantage of radical changes in employment
demands into the next century, a leading employment specialist said
yesterday.
Mr Michael Wilmott, director of social and economic research at the Henley
Centre, told a London conference that Britain was falling behind its
competitors in education and training. The development of both areas, he
said, was essential to supply a growing sector of 'knowledge workers' -
executives who know how to put knowledge to productive use - that experts
have forecast will dominate workplaces.
'Britain is not well placed to take advantage of the worldwide movement
towards the knowledge economy,' he said.
The employment revolution was being defined by a greater desire for flexible
working hours and working from home, according to surveys.
Employees' priorities were also changing, said Mr Wilmott, quoting a social
change survey carried out by the centre among employees earning more than
Pounds 15,000. When people were asked which of five options they considered
the least pleasant aspects of their job, the most widespread response - from
35 per cent of respondents - was work-related stress, followed closely by
travelling to and from work and long hours. Only a quarter listed poor
salaries.
