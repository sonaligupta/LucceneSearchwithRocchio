FT  16 NOV 93 / French student protest to continue


   By DAVID BUCHAN


   PARIS


FRENCH STUDENT leaders yesterday called for further demonstrations on
Thursday after leading a protest march through Paris' Latin Quarter to the
National Assembly which was debating next year's education budget.
Elsewhere students briefly blocked trains leaving Rennes in Brittany and in
the south students occupied part of the university of Aix-en-Provence. But
the demonstrations in protest at what students see as the Balladur
government's neglect of higher education did not draw the massive support
that its leaders had hoped.
Mr Jean Glavany, the Socialist party spokesman, denounced the government for
abandoning the previous Socialist government's priority for education, and
described as 'laughable' the present government's attempts to deal with
understaffing in France's universities.
The main problem sparking yesterday's demonstrations seems to be the surge
of students embarking on courses this autumn in social sciences and
psychology, whose university faculties have become very overcrowded, while
many vacancies exist in universities' technical faculties.
