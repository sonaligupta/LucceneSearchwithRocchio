FT  04 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: ACIL faces repayments of
ADollars 19.2m after ruling

   LONDON, SYDNEY


AUSTRALIAN Consolidated Investments (ACIL), the Australian investment
company which owns Bell Resources, faces repayments of ADollars 19.2m plus
interest to European retail investors, following a decision in the British
Court of Appeal last week.
The court found that the issuer's option to call a Dollars 200m convertible
Eurobond issued by Bell Resources Financial Services did not override the
investors' put option, set at a higher price.
'We believe the decision removes a degree of uncertainty from the market
(for investors holding bonds with put options),' said Mr David Newport, an
executive in the distressed debt division of Bankers Trust, which acted in
conjunction with the Law Debenture Trust Corporation on behalf of
bondholders.
Burton, the UK retailer, has already amended the documentation of a similar
deal, to clarify bondholders' rights to exercise the put option, he added.
Directors of ACIL may seek leave to appeal against the decision in the House
of Lords, following last week's overturning in the Court or Appeal of an
earlier decision in the High Court in 1991.
ACIL directors said yesterday that, acting on legal advice, they had not
provided for the Dollars A19.2m in the company's latest accounts. 'The
company is obtaining legal advice as to its legal position, including the
prospects of appeal to the House of Lords,' they said.
The dispute arose when bondholders last year tried to exercise the put
option providing for early repayment of principal at 117.7 per cent of par
value on November 13, 1991. Instead, bonds were redeemed at 103 per cent of
their par value, when the company exercised its call option.
