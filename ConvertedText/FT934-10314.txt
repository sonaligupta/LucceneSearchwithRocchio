FT  05 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Medeva unsettled


   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY


Trading in Medeva was in a state of flux yesterday after a court ruling over
its patent battle for its Hepatitis B drug took many by surprise.
Early in the session Medeva shares rose strongly on speculation that the
ruling, which had been widely tipped to be announced yesterday - a few weeks
earlier than expected - would be positive for the company. The price moved
up and even as some unofficial news filtered into the market that the ruling
had gone against Medeva, traders found it difficult to believe and the rise
continued. The shares hit a high of 135p, from 125p.
But a sell-off began as nerves started to grip the market and turnover rose.
Official confirmation of the ruling accelerated the slide and the price
rapidly headed towards its day's low of 109p.
A rally was mustered as the market digested the company's statement that it
would appeal against the judgment on its patent dispute with Biogen.
Turnover at the close was a hefty 14m, putting Medeva as the fourth most
heavily traded stock yesterday in the market.
One analyst said that the panic reaction to the ruling was understandable as
the company's medium and long-term future largely hinges on its Hepatitus B
drug. The shares closed at 119 1/2 p.
Other pharmaceuticals had a fairly unremarkable day. Wellcome continued to
bounce back after its poorly received figures with a rise of 11 to 716p.
SmithKline Beecham 'A' moved up 2 1/2 to 418p and Zeneca, still enjoying
positive sentiment over its heart drug, added 3 at 771p.
Figures from Boots sent the shares tumbling, before rallying as analysts and
institutions returned from what was seen as a positive post-results meeting
with the management. They were eventually 6 ahead at 511p after turnover of
8.8m.
Although the headline figure was at the bottom end of expectations, there
were a number of exceptional costs and the underlying performance from the
group's core businesses was considered generally satisfactory by many stores
analysts. Most edged their full-year forecasts up to around Pounds 470m.
Food retailers remained under a cloud as the sector reeled from the results
from J. Sainsbury on Wednesday and the supermarket group's talk of price
cuts and tight margins. A number of brokers were negative towards the
sector, although there were few fundamental changes of view. Sainsbury
slipped a further 9 to 376p in big turnover of nearly 7m. Argyll Group
declined 5 to 269p and Kwik Save 6 to 614p.
Food manufacturers were a similar story, with shares falling on the
continuing poor sentiment. Associated British Foods retreated 8 to 477p,
with Kleinwort Benson and James Capel said to be negative. Dalgety receded 9
to 442p as a big placing of 4.9m shares at 430p was recorded.
Shares slipped back in the telecoms sector as the market digested two sets
of results. Figures from BT were said by analysts to be generally pleasing,
but the level of dividend growth disappointed some. The fully-paid shares
fell 9 to 467 1/2 p, while the partly-paid slipped 10 to 217 1/2 p, the
latter on 23m traded.
BT's comments about the growth of fibre optic cabling helped BICC rise 6 to
403p. There was also some talk of BT using its brand for Cellnet, a hint
that some in the market took to mean that BT was about to buy out
Securicor's share of the cellular system. Securicor put on 5 at 1120p. BT
was also said to be distancing itself from recent speculation that it was
eyeing Thorn EMI, which eased 3 to 968p.
Results from Hong Kong Telecom, 58 per cent-owned by Cable and Wireless,
came in line with expectations, but C&W shares were reined in by
profit-taking, losing 13 at 480p.
Royal Bank of Scotland put on 3 at 367p after reports that Smith New Court
was positive.
SG Warburg, which announces its interims next Tuesday, ended 9 off at 909p,
after dipping below 900p at one stage.
Some nervousness ahead of impending interim results left BOC Group 11 down
at 651p in a generally weak chemicals sector. Its results are due in just
under a fortnight. Courtaulds, which posts its half-time figures the
following day, weakened 11 to 480p.
