FT  01 NOV 93 / International Company News: Stronger yen hampers
shipbuilders - Heavy Industries


   By ROBERT THOMSON


   TOKYO


JAPAN'S shipbuilders reported an increase in profits over the last three
years that ran against the tide of most companies' earnings, but their
results in the first half suggest that the yen's appreciation has left them
facing another period of restructuring.
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and the other leading heavy industrial companies
are reporting sales increases from ship and heavy equipment orders received
two or more years ago, but they are struggling against South Korean and
other international competitors.
MHI reported a 1.7 per cent fall in pre-tax profit to Y61bn (Dollars 575.5m)
on a 5 per cent fall in sales of Y1,056bn, though of more concern to the
company was an 8.7 per cent fall in orders received during the period from
April to September, compared to a year earlier.
Japanese shipbuilders attempted to reduce their dependence on the ship
market during the late 1980s, which had been an unreliable source of
earnings, but the recovery in ship demand in the late 1980s and the fall in
domestic industrial equipment orders has again increased that reliance.
In MHI's case, ship and steel structure sales rose from 10.9 per cent to
17.2 per cent of total sales over the past year. But orders for ships during
the half just ended fell 20.9 per cent on a year earlier, and the company's
recent experience in bidding for an order of seven LNG carriers for Qatar
highlights the extra burden of a strong yen.
MHI, Mitsui Engineering and Shipbuilding, and Kawasaki Heavy Industries won
a joint order for seven vessels from Qatar Liquefied Gas for the vessels,
which will be used to supply Chubu Electric Power, a electricity utility
based in central Japan.
But the bid price, reportedly Y26bn per vessel, is below the current
break-even cost of Y30bn for that type of carrier, according to Japanese
industry specialists, and the companies are facing a loss on the project if
the yen remains in the range of Y100-Y110 to the dollar.
Mr Matthew Ruddick, transport machinery specialist at James Capel Pacific,
said the heavy industrial companies have a relatively high export to sales
ratio, which makes them more vulnerable than many other industries to a
strengthening of the yen.
He said South Korean competitors, able to build a very large crude carrier
for Y9bn against the Y10bn in Japan, are winning orders at the Japanese
builders' expense, but the filling of the South Korean order books will
create demand for new vessels.
KHI reported a 24.8 cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y6.1bn, explaining that
the fall in interest rates over the past year had reduced its repayment
burden and improved its balance on financial items, compensating for an 8
per cent slide in operating profit during the period.
For the full year, KHI expects a 20.5 per cent fall in pre-tax profit to
Y18bn on a 0.5 per cent increase in sales to Y960bn. Sales rose 2.5 per cent
in the first half, due to ship and industrial machinery competitions, but
orders during the period were Y331.1bn, down from Y408.5bn a year earlier.
Kawasaki exports motorcycles, and the yen has slowed growth in this market,
which has been strong in east Asia during the last two years. The company is
planning to increase its overseas procurement of parts and materials by 30
per cent in the next year.
The rush of Japanese investment in east Asia is likely to mean weak orders
for plant and machinery in the domestic market. It could produce a rise in
export orders, though the companies' competitiveness will be hurt by the
strong yen.
They do not expect much help from defence orders, expected to remain
sluggish. Sumitomo Heavy Industries, which had a pre-tax loss of Y1bn,
compared with a profit of Y741m in the previous period, said orders in its
ship, steel structures and defence division were down 33 per cent, though
orders for environment-related and other general equipment rose 77.8 per
cent.
