FT  24 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Kohl is urged to head off veto


   By QUENTIN PEEL

CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl of Germany was urged yesterday to use his good
offices to prevent any French veto of the EC-US farm trade agreement.
The deal, negotiated last week, was hailed as a breakthrough by all main
political groups and lobbies in Germany, except the farmers' union. Even
farmers merely voiced sympathy for their French counterparts, but said they
would not organise violent protests.
The government cautiously welcomed the deal, and hoped France would not try
to veto it. Mr Dieter Vogel, government spokesman, said he hoped France
would be reassured by the examination of the deal by the European
Commission. He implied it might be possible to find some mitigation for
France during the investigation.
The most forthright endorsement came from the German Federation of Chambers
of Commerce (DIHT), the liberal Free Democrats in the ruling coalition, and
the opposition Social Democrats (SPD). The farm spokesman of Mr Kohl's
Christian Democrats, normally close to German farmers, expressed cautious
support.
The DIHT said the EC's external trade policy could not be allowed to fail
because of the French farmers' protests. It urged the German government to
use all its influence to ensure France backed the deal.
Mr Florian Gerster, SPD European affairs minister in Rhineland-Palatinate,
urged Mr Kohl to show firmness to France and dissuade it from vetoing the
deal and provoking a trade war with the US.
Mr Egon Susset, the Christian Democrats' parliamentary spokesman on
agriculture, said the deal should 'give room for manoeuvre once more to
European agricultural policy, and get the farming industry out of the dock'.
The deal should be critically examined, to ensure it did not go beyond the
Common Agricultural Policy reform agreed in the EC last May.
