FT  05 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: From Matthews to Malaysia


   From Mr DAVID MATTHEWS


Sir, I have a customer in Malaysia to whom I have sent the following letter:
'Dear Mr Wong,
Everyone in this country is sorry to hear that Malaysia is placing a ban on
British products, in our view totally illogically because the English press
is not controlled in any way by the British government.
'There seems only one way for the normal businessman to bring this home to
your citizens and I am afraid that is by the simple decision not to buy
anything else from your country. We will not, therefore, be buying any more
bookcases and it is a pity because they are a good product and they are
beginning to sell well.'
I suggest that similar letters from other readers could only be beneficial]
