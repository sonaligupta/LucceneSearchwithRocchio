FT  26 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Rebuff to Smith on block vote


   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent


LABOUR LEADER Mr John Smith suffered a setback yesterday at the MSF
technicians' union conference when delegates rejected the use of the
principle of one-member, one-vote instead of the union block vote for the
selection of Labour parliamentary candidates.
Mr Smith had spoken at the conference the day before, defending the proposal
for one-member, one-vote. Its rejection is a particular blow because it
suggests that his efforts last week to avert the prospect of a confrontation
with the unions over the issue are fail-ing.
At last Wednesday's meeting of Labour's ruling national executive committee,
Mr Smith proposed softening the original proposals by suggesting individual
union members should receive full party membership for a reduced rate.
