FT  19 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Ofwat proposes tough standards


TOUGHER service standards for water companies and increased compensation for
customers suffering through a failure to comply have been suggested by the
Office of Water Services (Ofwat), the industry's regulator.
Mr Ian Byatt, director general of Ofwat, has sent a series of proposals to
the industry to upgrade the current guaranteed standards scheme introduced
when the companies were privatised in 1989, and for a new code of practice
about compensating customers in areas of sub-standard service.
Mr Byatt has asked for responses by July 1, after which specific proposals
will be brought forward.
