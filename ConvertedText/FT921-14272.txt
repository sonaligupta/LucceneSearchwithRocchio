FT  16 JAN 92 / International Company News: Aluminium companies depressed


   By BARBARA DURR

EXTREMELY poor aluminium prices depressed results at two of America's
largest aluminium companies, Alcoa and Reynolds Metals.
Alcoa, the world's biggest producer of aluminium, suffered in addition from
heavy charges of Dollars 217m related to the costs of environmental
clean-ups and a restructuring.
In the fourth quarter, before the charges, Alcoa earnings were Dollars
25.6m, or 30 cents a share, compared with Dollars 134.6m, or Dollars 1.58 a
share, for the 1990 quarter.
After the charges, the fourth quarter came in at a loss of Dollars 191.4m,
or Dollars 2.26, compared with a loss of Dollars 140.4m, or Dollars 1.61,
for the year-ago period.
For all of 1991, Alcoa's net income, before the charges, fell to Dollars
279.7m, or Dollars 3.27 a share, on revenues of Dollars 10bn, compared with
net income of Dollars 570.2m, or Dollars 6.59 per share, on revenues of
Dollars 10.9bn in 1990.
While this was bad enough, once the charges were taken, the company's net
income dwindled to Dollars 62.7m, or 71 cents a share, down from Dollars
295.2m, or Dollars 3.40, in 1990.
At Reynolds, net income in the fourth quarter rose to Dollars 23.7m, or 40
cents a share, compared with Dollars 15.1m, or 25 cents, in the year-ago
quarter. However, in the fourth quarter of 1990, results were hit with a
Dollars 93.9m charge for environmental clean-ups.
For 1991, the company's net income dropped to Dollars 154.1m, or Dollars
2.60 a share, on revenues of Dollars 5.78bn, compared with Dollars 296.6m,
or Dollars 5.01, on revenues of Dollars 6.08bn.
Mr William Bourke, chairman of Reynolds, said the poor results were
attributable to 'the obstinate recession and a worldwide oversupply of
aluminium which has pushed prices, in real terms, to their lowest levels
ever'.
Margins were seriously eroded for both ingots and fabricated products, he
said.
Both companies had increased their shipments last year. Alcoa shipped 2.8m
metric tons, up from 2.7 m metric tons in 1990. Reynolds shipped 1.47m
metric tons, up from 1.42m in 1990.
