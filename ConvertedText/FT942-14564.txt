FT  20 APR 94 / More US spy cases loom, says CIA chief


   By REUTER


   WASHINGTON


Mr James Woolsey, director of the Central Intelligence Agency, said
yesterday more cases of Americans selling secrets to foreign agents were
about to unfold, Reuter reports from Washington.
He told NBC's Today Show that the CIA was not the only agency penetrated by
the Soviet Union and cases were being made against present and former
officials based on information obtained from abroad after the collapse of
communism.
CIA official Mr Aldrich Ames has been charged with being a Soviet 'mole' in
the CIA and blamed for the deaths of US secret agents in Russia. He and his
Colombian-born wife, Rosaria, are awaiting trial on espionage charges.
Mr Woolsey said there were similar cases in the works and indicated that Mr
Ames had yet to co-operate with government investigators, despite reports
that he is willing to help if the government promises leniency for his wife.
'As communism collapsed in East Germany and in the Soviet Union as well as
in eastern Europe and other countries, the CIA has come across a good deal
of counter-intelligence information,' Mr Woolsey said. 'We have shared this
as appropriate with law enforcement agencies in the US.' he said.
'People should not have the impression that the Aldrich Ames case is the
only counter-intelligence case,' he added. Even if Mr Ames refuses to tell
the full story of his alleged involvement with the Soviet Union in return
for cash, Mr Woolsey said, US investigators will be able to find out what
happened.
