FT  20 APR 94 / Investor confidence lifts value of financial rand


   By MARK SUZMAN


   JOHANNESBURG


The financial rand, South Africa's main barometer of investor sentiment,
soared yesterday on news that Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom
party had decided to participate in next week's election.
The volatile currency, which last week hit a record low of R5.71 to the
dollar, rose steadily during the day and closed in London at R4.915, up 43
cents on the day.
The commercial rand, the main trading currency, also shrugged off its recent
slide to finish at R3.5575 to the dollar against R3.6605. South African
gilts firmed significantly on the news, with long bond yields down 0.25 per
cent.
On the stock market, gold shares declined as the gold price weakened on
reduced fears of mine disruptions, but industrials finished up 166 points at
5,924. The all-share index at one stage rose 141 points before profit-taking
left it 110 points up at 5,080. The day's gains almost completely made up
losses suffered last week after the initial failure of talks with Inkatha.
Trading was relatively thin as local institutions held on to their stocks
while foreigners were looking for new investments. The combination of the
financial rand's rise and stock market strength meant that, in dollar terms,
some blue-chip shares saw gains of around 8 per cent on the day. 'Everyone's
turned buyers again,' said Mr Nick Pagdon, director of Smith New Court
Securities in London.
'The sentiment's still all politically driven,' remarked another broker,
'but at least this time the movement is up.'
Mr Cedric Savage, president of the South African Chamber of Business, said
the move would help create a positive investment climate. However, analysts
warned against undue optimism about foreign investment.
