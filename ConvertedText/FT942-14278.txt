FT  21 APR 94 / S Africa to bid for helicopter order


   By BERNARD GRAY


South Africa is to enter the competition to supply the British Army's new
attack helicopter. The invitation is a landmark in the country's efforts to
penetrate export defence markets.
The Ministry of Defence has allowed the South African Denel company to
tender its Rooivalk helicopter, following an approach from the company last
November. Denel has teamed up with Marshall of Cambridge to mount the bid.
A decision on which helicopter to use is expected next spring, and the
Pounds 2bn order for up to 100 helicopters is one of the army's top
priorities. Attack helicopters are now considered with tanks as the main
battlefield offensive weapons.
The invitation to Denel comes at a time of increasing defence links between
the UK and South Africa. Britain is to help train the new South African
army, formed from the merger of the old defence force and the armed wing of
the African National Congress.
South Africa is also thought to need six corvette ships. When the arms
embargo is lifted Swan Hunter might be in the running to build them.
