FT  26 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Community care spending helps Tunstall
advance to Pounds 3.17m


   By CATHERINE MILTON


TUNSTALL GROUP lifted first half pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.55m to Pounds
3.17m, thanks partly to higher spending by local councils under the
government's community care policy.
The shares surged 34p on the announcement to close at 447p.
The group, which supplies emergency communication and security systems,
improved turnover to Pounds 22.2m (Pounds 19.6m) in the six months to
end-March, which coincides with the local authority year-end.
Tunstall Telecom achieved Pounds 750,000 in sales of communications and
management control centres for community care administrators. It also won
'major orders' worth Pounds 800,000 from councils to cover requirements for
emergency communications devices for community care patients now living
outside hospitals.
More than 60 per cent of sales went to the UK public sector and Tunstall
said it expected to double sales of hospital communication and security
products in each of the next few years, from a low starting point.
Overseas sales improved Pounds 2.3m to some 22 per cent of the group's total
turnover, against 20 per cent at the September year-end. Tunstall ComSystem,
a German hospital communications subsidiary, had been 'temporarily slowed'
by the downturn in Germany, but its market was under-developed. The group
aims to establish a European network of associated companies and
subsidiaries.
Tunstall Electrics contributed Pounds 2m against Pounds 400,000 for the last
full year, stemming from contract manufacturing, although it continued to
fulfil its role as a supplier to group companies. One analyst pointed out
that 60 per cent of that turnover was to one company, Pace, the consumer
electronics maker.
Net interest payments were Pounds 148,000 (Pounds 89,000). Tunstall had
Pounds 5.2m cash at March 31, up Pounds 900,000 on the year-end.
Earnings per share moved up to 13.3p (10.2p) and the interim dividend is
lifted from 2.25p to 2.5p.
