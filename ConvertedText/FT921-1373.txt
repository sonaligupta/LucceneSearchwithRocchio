FT  24 MAR 92 / International Company News: Amex and AT&T target small
business community


   By MARTIN DICKSON


   NEW YORK


AMERICAN EXPRESS and American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&T), two corporate
giants under pressure from nimble rivals, have joined forces in an attempt
to woo the US small business community.
They announced yesterday that AT&T's corporate calling card and the American
Express corporate charge card would be jointly marketed to small businesses
as a single entity.
The system will allow small businesses which are American Express corporate
card members to charge AT&T telecommunications expenses along with other
out-of-office expenses and get a single monthly statement.
American Express is under pressure from the Visa and Mastercard credit card
operations.
