FT  29 JUL 92 / Number crunchers to figure on TV


   By ANDREW JACK


FOR PEOPLE who do not get enough of accountants during the working day,
television is to bring the profession into their homes late at night in the
autumn.
BBC Television's Select service, which offers programmes by subscription
using existing channels after hours, will broadcast one-hour slots once a
week to be called Business Account.
The programmes, produced by a company called Accountancy Television with the
backing of seven sponsors including BBC Select itself, will concentrate on
training for accountants in industry, commerce and smaller firms.
They will cover news, technical updates and training issues in the
profession, and will be accompanied by a weekly glossy magazine containing
programme details and training materials.
Subscribers will pay a basic Pounds 750 in the first year, which includes
the decoding device for unscrambling broadcasts. The venture will need at
least 10,000 subscribers to recover the initial Pounds 1.5m investment.
Insomniac number lovers who subscribe can watch the broadcasts at 2.15am on
Thursdays. Others can record the programmes and watch them at more
conventional times.
An introductory programme on September 17 and the first two full programmes
on October 1 and 8 will be unscrambled to try to tempt potential
subscribers.
