FT  12 MAR 93 / The Taurus Collapse: Angry City takes stock of lost money
and time


THE CITY was angry and surprised at yesterday's confirmation that the Stock
Exchange was cancelling the Taurus share settlement system.
Even after news leaked out on Wednesday that Taurus was likely to be
scrapped, many had not expected such a move.
Mr Michael Lawrence, finance director of the Prudential and chairman of the
100 Group of leading finance directors, said: 'A number of companies have
invested a lot of time and money in Taurus. I hope something can be
salvaged.'
Ms Judith Vincent, head of company and commercial law at the Confederation
of British Industry, said no one had been expecting the news - the CBI had
been planning a conference with the Stock Exchange for June on Taurus.
'Don't intrude on private grief,' she said. 'This is a shock. Certainly no
one expected it.'
Companies were counting the costs of cancellation. One stockbroking firm
estimated that it had spent about Pounds 1m on preparations for Taurus.
Estimates of banks' expenditure as share custodians and registrars vary. One
banker estimates that service registrars have spent between Pounds 30m and
Pounds 40m in the past three years on developing Taurus-suitable computer
systems.
Mr Martin Dorset, commercial director of Premier Systems, a computer
software company which had spent more than Pounds 1.5m working on
Taurus-related packages, said: 'It is a wasted investment for us, our
clients and everyone else in the market. It is fairly painful.'
Mr Geoffrey Madrell, head of Pro Share, said: 'The whole thing was put
together by committee. Now all the compromises have broken out into the
open.'
Mr David Adams, chief executive of Manchester's Henry Cooke Lumsden, one of
the leading firms of stockbrokers outside London, said: 'It's devastating
that so much money has been wasted. The whole thing has been driven by big
institutions and the notion that you had to have lots of interlinked systems
to ensure competition.'
Mr Robert Binney, business executive for global securities services in
Europe for Chase Manhattan, said: 'We will be the laughing stock of Europe.
We have a Third World settlement system in a first-rank financial centre.'
He said the Bank of England task force would have to risk some vested
interests being 'bent out of shape' in order to produce an automated
settlement system quickly.
Mr Terry Pearson, head of global custody at Royal Bank of Scotland, said the
bank had spent 'many millions' on Taurus, and that it had 'all gone down the
tubes totally'. Attention should now be focused on automating settlement for
institutional trading, leaving retail bargains on the current paper-based
system. 'The result might be a two-tier market. If that is unavoidable, we
should do it.'
Mr Christopher Bull, finance director of RTZ, said he was 'shocked' by the
news, and called the Stock Exchange's failed development a 'fiasco'. He said
it damaged the credibility of the UK software industry if it could not
devise a system that worked after the time and money spent on it.
Institutional fund managers were highly critical of the exchange. 'We are
the laughing stock of Europe,' said Mr Gordon Lindsey, managing director of
custody and investor services at the UK's largest fund manager, Mercury
Asset Management. 'It's done serious harm to London as an international
financial centre.'
Britain is one of the few countries not to offer paperless trading and
settlement. Germany, France, Switzerland, Spain, Italy, Hong Kong and even a
few emerging markets such as Taiwan, Korea and Indonesia have such trading.
Countries with such a service generally have speedier, cheaper settlement
systems, according to the institutional investors who use them though most
exchanges with paperless trading deal in 'bearer' shares which do not
designate ownership.
In the US, most transactions are 'demobilised' - all share certificates are
placed in a central depository, the Depository Trust Company, and settlement
is via book entry systems.
Private investors wishing to possess share transactions may do so - after
paying administrative costs.
'It is possible that the answer for Britain is a US-type system,' said Mr
Michael Robarts, a director of Fleming Asset Management.
Italy, once described by fund managers as a nightmarish stock exchange where
transactions could remain unsettled for months, may offer some lessons.
Following the stock market crash of October 1987, the Italian government
worked on making Monte Titoli, the securities clearing and settlement system
established in 1978, more effective. Such was their success that by 1992 it
held securities valued at L100,000bn, and there are now no physical
exchanges in the daily settlement of transactions in the Bank of Italy's
settlement rooms.
