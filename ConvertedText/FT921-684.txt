FT  27 MAR 92 / Man accused of insider dealing is sent for trial


   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent


THE FIRST person to be prosecuted in Scotland for insider dealing since 1981
has been sent for trial at the High Court in Edinburgh.
Mr Thorold Mackie, an investment analyst, was committed for trial from
Edinburgh sheriff court, charged with an offence under the 1985 Company
Securities (Insider Dealing) Act.
The charge alleges that while employed by Bell Lawrie White, an Edinburgh
stock-broker, he was in possession of unpublished price-sensitive
information about the imminent issue of a profits warning from Shanks &
McEwan, the waste management group, and 'counselled or procured' two Bell
Lawrie White salesmen to deal in the shares.
The previous case of insider dealing in Scotland was also the first in the
UK. In 1981, Mr John Bryce, a former partner in an Edinburgh firm of
investment managers, pleaded guilty. He was given an absolute discharge
after depositing Pounds 1,400 compensation.
