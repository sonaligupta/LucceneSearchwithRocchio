FT  15 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Restructuring leaves Manweb lower -
Distributor has no plans to merge with other recs as speculation boosts
shares


   By MICHAEL SMITH


Mr John Roberts, chief executive of Manweb, said yesterday the electricity
distributor had no plans to merge with other regional companies. 'Our aim is
to remain an independent business,' he said, announcing the first-half
results.
The Chester-based company reported a 40 per cent increase in the interim
dividend, in spite of a sharp decline in pre-tax profits and turnover.
In common with other companies in the sector it saw a strong rise in its
share price - up by 51p to 831p - although much of the increase was due to
speculation about bids and mergers.
Mr Roberts said Manweb was on track to cut jobs in the main distribution
business by 150 during the year. This would contribute to a 500 reduction in
the five years to 1997. Annual costs of Pounds 20m would be taken out by
then.
Pre-tax profits in the six months to September 30 fell by 58 per cent from
Pounds 54.9m to Pounds 23.2m on turnover lower at Pounds 394m, compared with
Pounds 437m.
The result was struck after exceptional costs including a Pounds 21.3m
restructuring provision.
Mr Roberts said Manweb planned, along with other recs, to demerge its full
holding in the National Grid, assuming flotation went ahead.
Earnings per share were 13.9p, compared with 34.1p, and the interim dividend
advances from 7p to 9.8p.
The dividend rise is the second highest in the sector so far. The company
said it was partly the result of rebalancing interim and final payments. The
underlying increase was about 15 per cent.
The company said profits before interest, restructuring and debt redemption
costs increased from Pounds 43.3m - also excluding one-off items - to Pounds
56.2m.
Manweb attributed the 10 per cent fall in turnover to a 13 per cent
reduction in supply business sales, where margins were tight. In the
distribution business, turnover rose 7 per cent to Pounds 126m.
The company is introducing price cuts of 2 per cent for domestic customers
from January 1.
It is also introducing a Pounds 6.8m energy efficiency scheme in Knowsley,
Merseyside, putting up half of the investment with the EU providing the
balance.
Mr Roberts said Manweb would pay up front for installation on customers'
premises for energy saving technology. 'By sharing the savings with the
customer we will receive a commercial return on our investment.'
