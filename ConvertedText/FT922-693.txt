FT  26 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Stoddard Sekers advances 30%


Stoddard Sekers achieved a 30 per cent profits increase in what the company
termed 'a most testing period.'
On sales up 7 per cent at Pounds 46.1m (Pounds 43m) the pre-tax figure
advanced from Pounds 2.51m to Pounds 3.26m in the year to March 31.
The company makes Wilton and Axminster carpets and fabrics. Mr Hugh
Laughland, the chairman, said the widely-predicted rise in consumer
confidence had failed to materialise. Demand remained low and the current
year had started disappointingly.
The final dividend of 1.875p (1.95p) makes an increased total of 2.625p
(2.5p) payable from earnings per share of 3.8p (2.8p).
The year ended with shareholders' funds at Pounds 19.4m (Pounds 18.5m)
borrowings of Pounds 330,000 (Pounds 590,000) and gearing at 1.7 per cent.
