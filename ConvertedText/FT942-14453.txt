FT  20 APR 94 / UK Company News: Chelsfield back in the black with Pounds 3m


   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent


Chelsfield, the property company headed by Mr Elliott Bernerd that joined
the stock market in December, yesterday announced pre-tax profits of Pounds
3.2m for 1993, against losses of Pounds 18m last time.
Net assets per share increased from 147.3p to 160p and after adjusting for
last December's share issue, there was a 15 per cent rise in shareholders'
funds over the year.
The company has put off plans to list its Atlanta residential apartments -
in a joint venture with P&O - as a Real Estate Investment Trust on the New
York Stock Exchange, as a result of the volatility of the US equity market.
However, Chelsfield said it was still seeking 'progressive realisation of
value' from the portfolio, which it acquired when it bought Laing Properties
with P&O in 1990.
Chelsfield said it was beginning redevelopment on a Pounds 4m scheme in New
Bond Street, London. It also expects to begin work on the redevelopment of
Wool House, south-west London, later this year. The company has planning
consent to build 115,000 sq ft of offices to a design by the late Sir James
Sterling.
Since the year end, the company has sold about Pounds 10m of property.
Operating profits increased from Pounds 1.38m to Pounds 17.3m, mainly
because of an increase from Pounds 7.76m to Pounds 13.7m in net income from
properties, and a turnround in fixed asset investment income from a Pounds
2.07m loss to a Pounds 6.51m profit.
Costs relating to the reorganisation of Pall Mall Properties fell from
Pounds 5.35m to Pounds 866,000. Net finance costs fell from Pounds 16.7m to
Pounds 13.9m.
Net borrowings at the year end totalled Pounds 143.4m, leaving net gearing
at 57 per cent.
Earnings per share were 4.1p, compared with losses of 26.6p. As anticipated
at the time of listing, the group has not paid a dividend for 1993, but 2.4p
is expected for the current year.
