FT  11 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Facility to boost E Europe travel


   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor


A MULTI-MILLION dollar facility to stimulate tourism in central and eastern
Europe is being launched this week by the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development, in collaboration with the World Travel and Tourism Council.
The facility will be made up of three parts: a fund for infrastructure
projects linked with stimulating travel and tourism; a fund for private
sector tourism projects such as hotels and holiday resorts; a third,
smaller, tranche for consultants commissioned to make feasibility studies.
EBRD funds will be matched by private sector investment 'in the form of
know-how and expertise,' said Mr James D. Robinson, WTTC chairman.
Travel and tourism in the region have been badly hit lately. Earnings fell
more than 8 per cent between 1989 and 1990, the last year for which the WTTC
has data. Capital investment in the region's travel and tourism is projected
to fall from Dollars 76bn in 1990 to Dollars 65bn (Pounds 45.7bn) this year.
