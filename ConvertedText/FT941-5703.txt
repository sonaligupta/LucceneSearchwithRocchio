FT  04 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets: Johannesburg ahead on steady foreign
demand


   By MATTHEW CURTIN


   JOHANNESBURG


South Africa had a better day yesterday in an unusually volatile week and
the overall index finished 50 higher at 4,931, writes Matthew Curtin in
Johannesburg.
The bullion price's descent below Dollars 380 an ounce took the gold shares
index 19 lower to 1,904. Industrial shares, however, remained buoyant, led
by strong overseas demand for Iscor, the steelmaker which produced
unexpectedly good half-year results last week. The stock lost 2 cents on the
day at R2.86 but the industrial index climbed 46 to 5,679.
The contradictory set of circumstances facing investors was dominated in
mid-week by initial confidence and then disillusionment with the degree of
progress in talks between the African National Congress and the Zulu Inkatha
Freedom Party. The weak gold bullion price and falling global markets also
contributed to instability, but deal-ers reported steady, if more subdued,
demand from over-seas investors for blue chip issues.
Mr Mike Brown at the stockbrokers, Frankel, Pollak, Vinderine, said that
local institutions were proving strangely hesistant, still weighing up the
shift in market sentiment at the end of 1993, brought on by the wave of
foreign buying which changed notions of value on the JSE.
Overseas investors could be forgiven for a wait-and-see approach as
elections loomed, but local fund managers might be missing out on an
opportunity to pick up good value scrip before another bout of foreign
investment.
