FT  28 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Subsidiarity should be for the birds


   From Mr ALAN TRENCH


Sir, Leolin Price QC (Letters, April 25) thinks that the issue of the
Cardiff Bay barrage raises serious concerns about the European Union and the
principle of subsidiarity. However, he does not seem to understand what
subsidiarity requires in the form implemented by the Maastricht treaty (and,
for environmental matters, by the Single European Act).
Subsidiarity means not only that the EU should not act when it is
inappropriate for it to do so, but, conversely, that it should act when it
is appropriate.
In the case of the Cardiff Bay barrage, the principle of subsidiarity
positively requires action at Union level, because habitats such as this are
used by birds which travel across Europe. Only when birds can be made to
stay within national boundaries will the situation be otherwise. The real
cause for concern is that the Commission has left it so late in the day to
show interest in a scheme which will have such a far-reaching effect.
