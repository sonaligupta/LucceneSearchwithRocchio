FT  08 JUN 92 / Supervisors 'confused' on functions


   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff


SUPERVISORS are confused about what they do and where they fit into company
structures, according to a Confederation of British Industry report
published today.
The report says that in some companies supervisors 'form a distinct
organisational tier which can become the 'piggy in the middle', trusted
entirely by neither management nor workforce and confused about their own
role'.
The competence of the UK's more than 1m supervisors has a significant effect
on business productivity, and the report, Focus on the First Line,
contributes to recent concern about the standard of supervision in the UK.
The National Economic Development Office last year criticised Britain's
supervisors as badly trained, especially in comparison with those in
Germany. A second study found that 96 per cent did not see improving
productivity as their most important goal.
Training for supervisors remains unsatisfactory and will have to adapt
because the job itself is changing rapidly, the CBI says.
The widespread move away from multi-tiered management means supervisors are
acquiring new roles as team leaders who support their workers rather than
deploying, inspecting and controlling them.
