FT  01 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Referral for SB Holdings buy


   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent


The Monopolies and Mergers Commission is to investigate the acquisition of
Kelvin Central Buses, a Glasgow-based operator, by SB Holdings, the holding
company of Strathclyde Buses.
Mr Jonathan Evans, corporate affairs minister, said yesterday that the
acquisition raised concerns about competition in the bus market in and
around Glasgow.
The Monopolies Commission is required to make its report by March 8. The
referral decision was taken on the advice of Sir Bryan Carsberg, the
director general of fair trading.
Kelvin Central was sold to its management by the Scottish Transport Group
for Pounds 1 in 1990 and bought by SB Holdings for Pounds 11.1m in
September.
A 20 per cent stake in SB Holdings was acquired by Stagecoach, the largest
UK bus group, on November 15, for Pounds 8.3m. Stagecoach said it might
acquire a larger stake in SB Holdings at a later stage, though the Office of
Fair Trading has said it would look into the deal.
SB Holdings was also acquired by its managers from Strathclyde Council in
1993. It has annual turnover of Pounds 86m, owns 1,330 vehicles and employs
3,700 staff.
