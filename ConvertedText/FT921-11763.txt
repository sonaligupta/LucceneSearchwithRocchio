FT  30 JAN 92 / International Company News: Bang & Olufsen stems losses


   By HILARY BARNES


BANG & Olufsen, the Danish television and audio equipment maker, staunched
its losses in the first half to November 30.
The group reported a first half profit of DKr2m (Dollars 322,000) compared
with a loss of DKr45m in the first half of last year and a full-year loss of
DKr145m. Sales were up 10 per cent to DKr1.16bn from DKr1.05bn.
The result after depreciation was turned from a DKr6m loss to a profit of
DKr24m and net financial costs were cut from DKr42m to DKr22m. There was a
management reorganisation last year, when Mr Anders Knutsen took over as
managing director.
