Avesta Sheffield, the Swedish-British stainless steel producer, yesterday
approved a SKr592.5m (Dollars 75m) one-for-seven rights issue to back an
aggressive investment programme and lift profits.
The company plans to spend more than SKr1bn over the next three years,
aiming to raise profits by SKr600m a year by 1997. Last year it cut losses
after financial items to SKr98m from SKr574m in 1992.
The largest investments include upgrading the company's melting shops in
Avesta and Sheffield.
