FT  19 APR 91 / International Company News: Travel side holds back American
Express


   By BERNARD SIMON


AN IMPROVED performance by American Express's banking, brokerage and
information businesses in the first quarter was tarnished by a 25 per cent
tumble in net income from its travellers' cheque and other travel-related
services.
The company's overall net earnings reached Dollars 264m, or 55 cents a
share, compared to a loss last year of Dollars 620m, or Dollars 1.50. The
loss was due to a Dollars 787m charge for restructuring and accounting
changes at Shearson Lehman Brothers.
Revenues rose 6.5 per cent to Dollars 6.3bn. The travel businesses, which
make up 38 per cent of revenues, were hit by the Gulf war, the recession,
and a Dollars 50m loan-loss provision. Earnings from this source fell to
Dollars 162m from Dollars 215m.
Sales of travellers cheques fell 14 per cent to Dollars 4.4bn.
Although the number of American Express credit cards continues to rise, the
company said the rate of increase had slowed as a result of tighter credit
criteria and less active solicitation of new customers.
Shearson Lehman recovered to a Dollars 51m profit, from last year's Dollars
915m loss, largely reflecting the improved climate in the securities
industry as well as a 13 per cent cut in fixed expenses. Revenues from
market-making and principal trading soared by 81 per cent to Dollars 467m.
