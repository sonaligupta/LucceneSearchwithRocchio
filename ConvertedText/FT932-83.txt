FT  30 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Hanson shares dip on US strike warning


   By MAGGIE URRY


SHARES IN Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate, dipped 3 1/2 p to 222 1/2
p yesterday after a representative of the United Mine Workers of America
told analysts the union planned to escalate strike action against Peabody,
Hanson's coal mining subsidiary.
Peabody suffered 'significant' costs from a strike in February, although not
the Pounds 15m claimed by the UMWA. The strike resumed in May after talks
broke down. Mr Ken Zinn, of the UMWA, said this one would cost Hanson 'much
more'.
Mr Zinn accused Peabody of setting up a new company, Premier Coal, which he
said would open non-union mines and so get round agreements on job security.
Mr Irl Engelhardt, chairman of Peabody, said Premier had applied for mining
licences but would not be opening any mines as the fall in the coal price
made the reserves uneconomic to mine.
Mr Engelhardt said the union mines were 28 per cent less productive and had
higher labour costs than non-union mines. He said Peabody wanted a contract
with the union which would make union mines competitive.
