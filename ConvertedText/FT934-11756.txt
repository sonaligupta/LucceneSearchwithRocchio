FT  29 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Asset growth at Mezzanine Cap


   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor


MEZZANINE Capital & Income Trust 2001, a split capital investment trust
which invests in US debt and unquoted equities, yesterday declared a 10 per
cent increase in its interim dividend to 5.5p.
The capital shares of the trust were the best performing of all investment
trust shares over the five years to October 1 with growth of 307.6 per cent
(mid-market to mid-market with income reinvested). The net asset value per
capital share rose by 7.1 per cent from 255.3p to 273.4p over the six months
to September 30.
The trust paid a special interim dividend of 4p during the first half
following the flotation of American Safety Razor, one of Mezzanine's highly
concentrated portfolio of investments. Mezzanine also realised its equity
holding in Custom Chrome, which supplies accessories for motor cycles.
In June, the trust, which is managed by Jordon Zalasnick Advisers, invested
Dollars 9m (Pounds 5.9m) in LePage, a tape manufacturer.
Earnings per income share were 6.96p (5.22p) and net assets per income share
at the end of September were 122.7p.
The trust has an unusual split between the rights of capital and income
shareholders. The first 100p of assets goes to those who own capital shares;
the next 100p to income shares; after that 90 per cent goes to the capital
and 10 per cent to the income shareholders.
