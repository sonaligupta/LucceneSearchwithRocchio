FT  23 APR 93 / Retailers back cut in CD prices


TWO leading music retailers said yesterday they favoured a cut in compact
disc prices but that it was up to manufacturers to take the initiative.
Sir Malcolm Field, group managing director of WH Smith, told the Commons
national heritage committee that the high price of CDs was stifling demand.
The most important buyers of music were aged 16 to 24 and the price of a CD
represented about 10 per cent of average weekly take-home pay, he said.
Mr Brian McLaughlin, UK managing director of HMV, said he disagreed with Sir
Malcolm that sales are depressed by high prices. He said HMV's CD sales had
grown well over the past three years.
He said, however, that consumer resentment was likely to grow as a result of
the issue's publicity. HMV hoped to see lower prices, he added.
Both Sir Malcolm and Mr McLaughlin said, however, that retailers could not
reduce prices on their own. Sir Malcolm said CDs had the lowest gross
margins of any product sold by WH Smith with the exception of newspapers.
