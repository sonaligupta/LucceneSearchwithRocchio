FT  22 DEC 92 / International Company News: Snecma warns of heavy loss for
year


   By Alice Rawsthorn in Paris


SNECMA, France's state-controlled aircraft engine maker, yesterday warned
that it would make a substantial loss in 1992 and that it saw no prospect of
a return to the black next year.
Mr Gerard Renon, chairman, said the group had been badly affected by the
problems of its customers in the civil aviation industry and by the general
economic slowdown. Snecma specialises in the production of engines for
Airbus jets in both the civil and military sectors.
The chairman, who recently announced a first-half loss for the company,
forecast continued losses for the second half of this year. This would
produce an overall loss of around FFr600m (Dollars 112m) for 1992,
significantly higher than 1991's loss of FFr68m. Snecma lost FFr302.75m on
consolidated sales of FFr6.1bn in the first six months of this year.
Mr Renon also warned of a probable fall in sales for 1992 of around 6 per
cent or 7 per cent to FFr13.5bn. He anticipated a further fall in sales, and
sustained pressure on profitability, next year. 'Given the pressure on sales
and margins, it will be difficult for us to return to break-even,' he said.
Snecma has suffered from depressed demand in 1992. The level of production
of its CFM 56 engines has fallen from 880 in 1991, to 770 this year, and to
a projected 550 in 1993. This problem was recently aggravated by the
cancellation of an order from Northwest Airlines of the US for 74 Airbus
fitted with CFM 56 engines made by the French group and General Electric,
its US partner.
The company has already taken steps to cut costs. Mr Renon warned that there
could be more temporary lay-offs and short-time working at its production
plants, but said there would be no increase in the 800 job losses already
announced. 'We mustn't over-react,' he said. 'We have to ensure that we have
the capacity to recover in the medium term.'
