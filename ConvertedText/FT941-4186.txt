FT  12 MAR 94 / Abta wins holiday insurance test case


A schoolgirl and her teacher yesterday lost a High Court test action against
the Association of British Travel Agents over a holiday insurance premium
that was not repaid when an Abta member became insolvent.
The value of the claim, on behalf of 54 other pupils at Nower Hill School,
Pinner, north London, was just Pounds 10, but a further 25,000 cases rested
on the outcome.
The teacher had booked the holiday with Abta member Adventure Express Travel
Services. The company became insolvent before the party was due to leave,
and Abta refunded the money already paid except for the insurance.
The teacher claimed that the deduction by Abta, which denied liability, was
a breach of what it had promoted as 'the Abta promise' and that the
association was therefore in breach of contract.
Mr Justice Mitchell ruled that the Abta notice, which explains to customers
the form of protection Abta extends to them, did not contain words of
contractual promise and therefore no contract existed between the teacher
and Abta.
