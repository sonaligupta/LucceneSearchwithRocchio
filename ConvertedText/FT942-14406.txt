FT  20 APR 94 / International Company News: Sales surge helps Reliance
improve profits by 79%

Reliance Industries, the chemicals and textiles conglomerate which is
India's biggest private sector company, yesterday announced a 79 per cent
increase in net profits to Rs5.76bn (Dollars 184m) for the year to March 31,
due to sharp increases in sales and production capacity.
Reliance, which completed a Dollars 300m global depository receipt equity
issue in February, its third international offering, posted a 30 per cent
increase in sales to Rs53.46bn from Rs41.06bn.
Operating profits increased by 20 per cent to Rs10.59bn from Rs8.81bn, and
cash profit to Rs8.28bn from Rs6.02bn. Total expenditure rose to Rs44.04bn
from Rs32.93bn.
Mr Anil Ambani, joint managing director, said the company's results, which
had shown 'an improved performance on all major indicators', also reflected
the changes in depreciation norms recently announced by the Indian
government which, he said, were 'now in line with international standards
prevalent in this industry. Thus these changes will truly reflect the life
of our assets and a fair charge on the profit and loss account in our
business.'
The company - which has more than 2.6m shareholders, the largest
shareholding group in India - reported that earnings per share would
increase by 60 per cent to Rs21.24 from Rs13.24 in spite of a 12 per cent
growth in equity capital to Rs2.71bn from Rs2.42bn.
The Bombay-based company started 35 years ago as an integrated textiles
business, adding synthetic fibres, fabrics, chemicals and plastics, and most
recently, oil and gas production.
The group launched India's largest corporate fundraising exercise last year.
Reliance raised Rs8.6bn from the Indian public, the first slice of a
Rs21.7bn convertible bond issue for a new company, Reliance Petroleum, which
plans to construct a Rs51.4bn oil refinery, India's largest private sector
investment to date.
