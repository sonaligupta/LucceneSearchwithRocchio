FT  13 MAR 92 / Devaluation results in a stern test for Lagos


   By MICHAEL HOLMAN


   LAGOS


RISING consumer prices and a weakening naira were being closely monitored by
Nigeria's military government yesterday as the market responded to last's
week's decision to float the national currency.
Foreign exchange bureaux in Lagos valued the naira at between 19.50 and
19.75 to the US dollar, down from Monday's Central Bank fixing of 18. The
rate was 10.6 naira to the dollar before last Thursday night's announcement.
The bureaux do not set the official rate, which will be done each Tuesday by
the Central Bank in response to demand, but they are an important market
indicator.
Uncertainty about the implications dampened initial responses to the
devaluation, but prices of many items, with and without an imported content,
have started rising sharply over the past 48 hours.
Government officials point out that the prices of many goods already
reflected the premium on scarce foreign exchange, and were hoping that
post-devaluation increases would be comparatively modest. The cost of
domestically produced staple foods, they say, should change significantly.
Lagos bankers believe the naira should stabilise, and perhaps recover
slightly, as a liquidity squeeze and other measures - including promised
curbs in government spending - take effect.
But a testing period lies ahead, in which government will come under
pressure to back down from a decision widely seen as causing Nigerians more
pain, with no gain.
Neither the local press nor the government have linked the devaluation to
terms for a new stand-by agreement with the International Monetary Fund,
which would pave the way to further external debt rescheduling.
