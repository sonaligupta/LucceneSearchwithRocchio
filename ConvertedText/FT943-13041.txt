FT  21 JUL 94 / 'Big gaps' in Brent Walker records


A former senior Brent Walker accountant instructed to investigate
allegations of improper transactions within the property and leisure group
was unable to find documents relating to the deals, the Old Bailey heard
yesterday.
Mr David Day, a former group chief accountant, was giving evidence in the
trial of Mr George Walker, the company's former chairman; and Mr Wilfred
Aquilina, its former finance director.
The two men deny charges of theft, false accounting and conspiring to
falsify the company's accounts. The prosecution claims they fraudulently
boosted Brent Walker's profits by Pounds 19m.
Mr Day, a prosecution witness, said that in 1988 he was asked by Mr Aquilina
to investigate press claims that transactions within the company's film
division had not been properly handled, but found 'large gaps' in the
supporting documentation relating to the transactions.
Mr Walker and Mr Aquilina reacted with 'no great surprise', he said.
The prosecution claims these transactions, concerning the sale of film
rights, were bogus and a means of disguising the illegal profit-boosting.
The trial continues today.
