FT  15 APR 94 / Charges over Chile metals losses


   By DAVID PILLING


   SANTIAGO


Two former executives of Codelco, Chile's state copper company, have been
charged with defrauding the state in connection with losses of more than
Dollars 200m (Pounds 135m) made on metals futures trading in London and New
York.
Mr Owen Guerrini and Mr Carlos Derpsch, former head and deputy head of sales
respectively, were the immediate superiors of Mr Juan Pablo Davila, the
futures operator accused of making the unprecedented losses.
Codelco, the biggest copper producer in the world, accounts for 20 per cent
of Chile's foreign exchange earnings.
The two former executives were charged on Wednesday and both were denied
bail. Mr Davila, also charged with defrauding the state, is also being held.
A fourth executive, Mr Gonzalo Trivelli, former vice-president of sales, was
released for lack of evidence. His uncle, former President Patricio Aylwin
who stepped down last month, has proclaimed Mr Trivelli's innocence.
Various teams investigating the futures losses have still not discovered
exactly how Codelco managed to lose the equivalent of 0.5 per cent of
Chile's gross domestic product in a matter of months.
It remains unclear whether controls to prevent big losses were deliberately
circumvented or whether the board of directors had been informed of
Codelco's speculative - rather than hedging - activities. Even the amount of
losses, put at anywhere between Dollars 207m and Dollars 312m, is still in
question.
The new administration of President Eduardo Frei has pledged to modernise
the unwieldy structure of Codelco. Privatisation has been ruled out but the
company's six divisions are to be split into autonomous units, some of which
would be able to undertake joint ventures with the private sector. Codelco
speculation on metals futures has been suspended indefinitely.
