FT  30 OCT 93 / Mayhew endorses Irish peace plan


   By TIM COONE


SIR PATRICK MAYHEW, the Northern Ireland secretary, last night strongly
endorsed the peace plan outlined by the Irish government earlier this week
as a basis for future round-table negotiations on Northern Ireland, Tim
Coone writes.
Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Any Questions programme he said: 'I don't believe
the principles can seriously be objected to and we want to consider them
very carefully and to see whether, applying those to the talks process, we
can't take that process on and through to success.'
Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party,
said on the same programme that three of the Irish government's points
included proposals made in the Hume-Adams peace initiative.
Mr David Trimble MP, home affairs spokesman for the Ulster Unionist party,
warned the British government 'to be on guard against the Irish government,
which is cynically recycling the Hume-Adams proposals'.
