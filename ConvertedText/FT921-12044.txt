FT  29 JAN 92 / Letter: Charges on overdue money


   From Mr B J MCGINITY


Sir, Further to your article on companies' financial policies (January 27).
In a number of European countries, for example Germany and Sweden, companies
are automatically charged interest on monies not paid to their suppliers by
the appropriate due date.
This is a significant benefit to small companies which, if they do not
receive payment from their customers, can charge as much as 8 per cent over
the prevailing bank rate. It is therefore advantageous for the larger
companies to pay bills promptly as their interest charges on bank overdrafts
are below this level. The absorption of this principle into British company
law would, I believe, dramatically improve both confidence and liquidity in
business.
