FT  28 SEP 94 / Bonn to subsidise carriage maker

The German government and the Treuhand privatisation agency will provide a
capital injection for Deutsche Waggonbau, the east German rail carriage
maker and one of the last big enterprises to be privatised, writes Judy
Dempsey in Berlin.
The subsidies, which will run into 'triple figures', will finance
restructuring and compensate for losses incurred following the virtual
collapse of DWA's markets in Russia, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the federal
economics minister, said yesterday.
The government's pledge to grant more financial support to DWA, estimated to
total DM390m (Pounds 160m) for this year alone, coincides with the last
weeks of the federal election campaign. The pledge is also another attempt
to make DWA more attractive for private investors.
Before German unification, the giant complex, spread over three east German
states, employed more than 25,000. That figure has since been reduced to
7,000 and more redundancies are forecast if the Treuhand presses ahead with
'strategy DWA 2000', a plan for producing a new generaton of passenger
trains. Job losses will however be resisted by both the state governments
and IG Metall, the engineering trade union.
