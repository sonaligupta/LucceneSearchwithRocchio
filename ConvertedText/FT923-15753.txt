FT  01 JUL 92 / UK urges early action on Earth Summit goals


   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor


BRITAIN is hoping to secure a commitment from all the leading industrial
countries to set the end of 1993 as the deadline for implementing many of
the decisions taken at the Rio Earth Summit.
The prime minister, Mr John Major, has written to the heads of government of
all the European Community and Group of Seven countries proposing an
eight-point plan to preserve the momentum created by the event.
The points were agreed by EC leaders at their recent Lisbon summit. They
will now be put to the G7, which includes the US, Japan and Canada, at next
week's summit in Munich.
Mr Major wants industrial countries to ratify the Rio convention on climate
change and draw up plans to implement it by the end of next year.
He is proposing a similar deadline to draw up plans for the second Rio
treaty, on protecting bio-diversity, though he is not pressing for
ratification because the US has already refused to sign. Other points in his
letter include a suggestion that countries say how they will implement
Agenda 21, the Rio action programme, and give financial support to help
poorer nations implement it.
