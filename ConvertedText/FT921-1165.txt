FT  25 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Pollsters nervous over opinion fluctuations


   By RICHARD EVANS


THE SPREAD in opinion polls from a Labour lead of five percentage points to
a similar Conservative lead is worrying for pollsters nervous about their
reputations, and puzzling to politicians and public alike.
In fact, the apparently wide variation in results is not as big as it seems.
During the 1987 campaign, the Tory lead ranged from four to 18 points, but
as the lead itself did not change much less attention was paid to the
variation.
This time the range is 10 points, but because the lead has changed and the
two main parties are so evenly balanced, the differences in results are much
more obvious.
Most vulnerable to criticism is the Harris Research Centre, which gave the
Tories a five-point lead in yesterday's Daily Express - out of line with
most weekend polls - and Labour a four-point lead in a poll for ITN last
night.
Mr Robert Waller, Harris research director, said: 'We do not think there has
been a big shift of opinion. But most polls are based on interviews done
during the week and our Express interviews were over the weekend. This could
have made a difference.' The disparity between the two polls was not as
great as it first seemed, given the accepted error range of three to four
percentage points, he said.
Weekend polling, especially in the home, is more likely to find commuters
and professional people, and could therefore favour the Tories. Another
factor in the disparity might be that the poll for ITN was based on more
than 2,000 interviews - about twice the number for the Express poll.
Most published polls assess the state of the parties across the whole of
Britain, excluding Northern Ireland, which has a different party structure.
Five companies - Gallup, NOP, Mori, Harris and ICM - poll regularly using
face-to-face interviews. All are members of the Association of Professional
Opinion Polling Organisations, which lays down the ground rules.
Polls use the quota system, which ensures that interviewees are a
representative demographic sample of a constituency, with divisions by sex,
class and age. The results are weighted from experience to offset any
limitations.
National polls conducted by in-home interviews by Harris and others aim for
between 1,000 and 1,500 interviewees in 100 constituencies or sampling
points, selected to give an accurate political reflection of the country as
a whole.
ICM favours in-street interviewing in town and city centres and uses 54
sampling points. Some pollsters use both techniques and vary interviews
between day and evening, and some do two-day polling. Audience Selection
specialises in telephone polls.
What divides the pollsters is the order in which questions are put. Mr Bob
Worcester, chairman of Mori and the doyen of British pollsters, argues that
the main question of voting intention should be put first, whereas Gallup
has always put it after 'warm-up questions' on the government's record and
standing of party leaders.
National polls are regarded as much more reliable than regional or
constituency ones, as there is more information to assemble a national
profile. Regular interviewers are trained - none of the organisations is
employing extra election staff.
Except in 1970, when all but one of the final polls picked the wrong winner,
the record in recent general elections has been a good. There is already
nervousness that this time the pollsters could find themselves publishing an
accurate poll but still picking the wrong winner.
'It is a bit of a nightmare,' said Mr Bob Wybrow, Gallup's polling director.
'But if there is a hung parliament there could be another election by
November and we'd cry all the way to the bank.'
