FT  28 MAR 92 / UK Company News: BDM has Pounds 29m price tag in market
float


   By RICHARD GOURLAY


BRITISH DATA Management, a business services group, yesterday announced that
it was seeking a Stock Exchange listing through the placing of 52 per cent
of the company at 125p.
The placing values the company at Pounds 29.1m and puts the shares on a
multiple of 11 times prospective earnings of 11.4p, based on a pre-tax
profits forecast for the year to June of Pounds 3.5m.
About Pounds 10m of the proceeds will repay debt and reduce gearing to give
the new public company nil gearing.
The balance is being taken out of BDM by three directors, led by the
chairman Mr Stephen Crown, who bought the present operating divisions from
Britannia Security Group in 1989 for Pounds 10m.
Most of the shares were placed yesterday with a variety of institutions, but
1m were placed with private investors.
BDM's main subsidiary, Britannia Data Management, is the UK's largest
contract storer of oil exploration data for major oil companies. It is also
involved in off-site storage of documents and back-up computer data and the
long-term storage of archives.
BDM also owns Eurocrate, the UK's second largest supplier of removal crates,
and Britannia Storage Systems, which is involved in design and installation
of data storage systems.
Mr Crown said that division had been hit by recession but was the only
profitable area in 1989 and provided essential cash flow for the group.
Mr Crown will retain 32 per cent of the company. He said none of the
directors would be selling in the near future and that he would allow his
stake to fall as the group grew through acquisitions.
In the year to June 1991, BDM made operating profits of Pounds 2.3m on sales
of Pounds 12.68m, and paid Pounds 1.17m in interest on debt taken on to
finance the acquisition from Britannia Security Group before it was taken
over by ADT. In 1990 operating profits were Pounds 989,000 against losses of
Pounds 253,000 in 1989.
Mr Crown said BDM would be the only quoted company dedicated to data
management.
NM Rothschild sponsored the placing and Smith New Court was broker.
