FT  04 AUG 92 / Italian financial markets welcome wage deal


   By HAIG SIMONIAN


   MILAN


ITALY'S financial markets rebounded strongly yesterday in response to
abolition of the scala mobile wage indexation system and signs that Prime
Minister Giuliano Amato's new government is having some success in
countering the country's economic ills.
Shares at the Milan stock exchange had one of their best days in months; the
Comit equity index closed at 416.64, up almost 15 points from Friday's close
of 401.72.
The lira recovered strongly in the foreign exchange markets, breaking
through the psychologically important barrier of L755 against the D-Mark, to
be fixed at L754.95, its highest level against the D-Mark for weeks.
Equity dealers described the deal to end the scala mobile, agreed on Friday
night, as historic, even if many details of future wage bargaining
arrangements have still to be fleshed out. Mr Nino Cristofori, the labour
minister, said yesterday that negotiations between the government, employers
and unions would restart in early September at the latest, with a view to
concluding talks by the middle of the month.
However, some brokers cautioned that yesterday's surge in prices came
against a thin market, which had also been affected by a breakdown of the
screen-based dealing system and signs of selling by some foreign investors.
Mr Leonida Guadenza, a leading Milan broker, warned against over-enthusiasm.
Some bankers felt that the country's new mood of industrial harmony could be
shattered by the consequences of Saturday's resignation by Mr Bruno Trentin
as secretary-general of the CGIL union federation.
Mr Trentin's decision could prompt uncertainty and division within Italy's
biggest trade union group, whose executive is split between a majority
sympathetic to the Democratic Party of the Left - which groups most of the
former members of Italy's communist party - and the Socialists, and a
faction aligned with the Reconstructed Communism party, which includes many
of the hard-left members of the former communist party.
