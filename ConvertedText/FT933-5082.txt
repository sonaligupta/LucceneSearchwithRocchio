   KUALA LUMPUR


MALAYSIA'S gross domestic product grew by 10.4 per cent in the second
quarter, writes Kieran Cooke in Kuala Lumpur. This compares with 9.6 per
cent in the same period last year and 7.6 in the first quarter, according to
the central bank. Growth for the year could now average out at more than 8
per cent, analysts think.
Manufacturing output rose 17.4 per cent in the second quarter. Agricultural
production went up 8.1 per cent, mainly thanks to palm oil.
