FT  14 APR 94 / International Company News: ACCBank shows 28% rise


   By TIM COONE

ACCBank, the state-run Irish bank which the government has said it intends
to privatise, reported a 28 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to IPounds
11.2m (Pounds 10.8m) for the year to December 31.
Originally dedicated to the agricultural sector, the bank has in the past
six years diversified into the personal lending and small business sectors.
Net interest income expanded by 9.4 per cent to IPounds 37.1m in 1993, and
total assets rose by 8.3 per cent to IPounds 932m. Administrative costs were
up 9 per cent to IPounds 23.6m. Dealing profits of IPounds 1.6m gave an
important boost to the bottom line.
The bank reported a loan book of IPounds 574m, two thirds of which has a
maturity of more than five years. A further IPounds 218m was loaned to other
banks, 75 per cent on short-term deposits of less than three months.
Mr Dan McGing, chairman, pointed out that this marked the sixth successive
year of double-digit growth, although he acknowledged that the level of
performance would be difficult to maintain.
Total dividends are doubled to IPounds 1.53m, which go to the Irish
government as the 100 per cent shareholder.
Two years ago Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance minister, said that the
government intended to dispose of the bank, but the present Fianna
Fail-Labour coalition appears to be procrastinating over whether to
privatise it or merge it into a larger entity with other financial
institutions from both the private and public sectors.
