FT  03 AUG 92 / Poles back reforms


   By AGENCIES


   WARSAW


THE Polish parliament approved constitutional amendments at the weekend
giving greater powers to the president and prime minister, agencies report
from Warsaw.
The Sejm (lower house) adopted the so-called small constitution by 241 votes
to 55, with 55 abstentions. The vote was just seven votes above the
two-thirds majority needed to pass the amendments, which redefine relations
between the government, president and parliament.
The package aims to prevent conflicts between the president and the
government such as those which accompanied the short-lived goverment of Mr
Jan Olszewski, formed in December 1991 and dismissed by the Sejm in June.
However, while the amendments allow the president to appoint a cabinet, they
prevent him from dismissing it.
