FT  13 MAR 93 / Liberal judge to quit supreme court


   By JUREK MARTIN


JUSTICE Harry Blackmun, one of the two most liberal members of the US
Supreme Court, has said he expects to retire soon.
The 84-year-old Nixon appointee also announced that he thought Justice Byron
White, the only Democratic appointee on the court but now one of its more
conservative voices, might also soon quit. Last week the Washington Post
reported that Justice White had hired no new office interns for the term
beginning after the summer.
Justice Blackmun and Justice John Paul Stevens, named by President Ford,
have operated to great effect in a court intended by Presidents Reagan and
Bush to acquire a more conservative mould. Their judicial alliances with
Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, David Souter and Anthony Kennedy, three swing
votes who have sometimes confounded conservative expectations, have often
frustrated the doctrinaire right wing judicial agenda on issues like
abortion.
If the two justices retire, President Bill Clinton would be the first
Democrat to make Supreme Court nominations since President John Kennedy
appointed Justice White in 1962.
Other departures are possible, but Justice Blackmun said that unless Mr
Clinton won a second term, when more vacancies might occur, he thought
conservative predominance on the Supreme Court could last until the next
century.
Mr Clinton is unlikely to find a judge more progressive than Justice
Blackmun, though Justice White has more often than not voted with court
conservatives. Mr Mario Cuomo, the governor of New York, is among those
regularly mentioned as a possible Clinton nomination.
