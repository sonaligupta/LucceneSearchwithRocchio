FT  25 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Bridon cut down to Pounds 3.6m loss


   By RICHARD GOURLAY


BRIDON, the wire rope manufacturer, reported a slide into losses after
margins collapsed under extreme international competition.
Losses amounted to Pounds 3.6m, against pre-tax profits of Pounds 10.1m last
time. Sales fell to Pounds 319m (Pounds 336m). Losses per share were 6.4p
(earnings of 14.3p) but the company decided to pay a reduced final dividend
of 1.5p, giving a total for the year of 4p, half the 1990 level.
The share price slipped from 89p to 75p.
Mr David Allday, chief executive, said the recession had had a dramatic
impact on margins, which had fallen from 4.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent. The
group had also faced relocation costs and a large bad debt.
The group would now enjoy the benefit of a large contract with Shell, Mr
Allday said, and should return to profitability and a covered dividend. 'And
when the economy turns around we are not going to chase volume but margins.
Technically we are the most cost efficient in Europe.'
COMMENT
When a company swings from Pounds 10m pre-tax profits to losses of Pounds
3.6m, one might be forgiven for wondering how it can justify paying a
dividend. When that company is in the wire rope business, one of the most
cut-throat of European engineering industries, the question is all the more
pertinent. The simple answer is that if Bridon had not paid a dividend,
shareholders would have very little reason to stay with the company at all.
And there is a chink of light. The longer recession in Europe continues, the
more likely Bridon - as one of the most efficient producers - is likely to
emerge at the top of a battered pile. Nevertheless, recovery will be slow.
Pre-tax profits of about Pounds 1.5m are expected for 1992, giving 2.1p
earnings that would again not cover the dividend.
