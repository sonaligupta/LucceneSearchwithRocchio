FT  16 NOV 93 / Bottomley calls for more work on health


   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent


MORE HARD work will be needed to meet some of the government's Health of the
Nation targets, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, said yesterday.
The Health of the Nation strategy is intended to produce measureable
improvements in the areas of coronary heart disease and strokes, cancer,
mental illness, sexual health and accidents.
Mrs Bottomley told a review of its first year that 16 of 19 targets where
new figures were available were moving in the right direction. But this was
not the case with obesity, suicide and smoking among young people.
More people were obese than previously thought - 13 per cent of men and 15
per cent of women compared with 7 per cent and 12 per cent in 1986-87.
Suicide figures showed a slight increase, while there had been only marginal
changes in smoking among 11-to-15-year-olds between 1990 and last year.
In addition to the three problem areas identified by Mrs Bottomley, a
government report yesterday shows faster progress will be needed elsewhere
to meet the targets.
In the past year there was a 4.8 per cent reduction in the number of people
under 65 dying from coronary heart disease, but the document says 'the
current rate of progress will have to improve' to meet the targets.
The report brought fresh calls from Dr Sandy Macara, chairman of the British
Medical Association Council for a ban on cigarette advertising.
