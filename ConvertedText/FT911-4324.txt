FT  19 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Chancellor still sure of an upturn


   By IVOR OWEN


MR NORMAN LAMONT, the chancellor, told the Commons yesterday he was 'still
confident' of an upturn in the economy in the second half of this year,
writes Ivor Owen.
Labour MPs cited the record rise in unemployment in March, increasing to
more than 2m, as further evidence of the failure of government policy.
To cheers from his supporters Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, said Mr
John Major was 'truly the prime minister of unemployment'.
Mr Lamont, who stressed that the unemployment figures lagged behind the
general performance of the economy, refused to be drawn on the prospects for
a further reduction in interest rates.
