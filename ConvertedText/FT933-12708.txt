FT  22 JUL 93 / International Company News: Leif Hoegh posts sharp advance

LEIF HOEGH, one of Norway's biggest shipowners, yesterday announced
first-half pre-tax profits up sharply to NKr471m (Dollars 64.45m) from
NKr120m in the same period last year.
The improvement was helped by a NKr258m gain from the disposal of assets, a
stronger dollar, improved markets for tankers and dry bulk carriers, and
lower interest payments. Mr Olav Geir Foss, director, forecast full-year
pre-tax profits of about NKr400m, up from NKr278m in 1992.
Earlier, the shipowner forecast operating profit in 1993 would rise to about
NKr350m from NKr309m in 1992.
Mr Foss said the value of the group's share and bond portfolios had also
increased.
Group freight revenue in the period rose to NKr1.21bn from NKr1.08bn as
operating profit increased to NKr176m from NKr161m. Bona Shipholding, the
group's tanker and dry bulk carrier operation, boosted first half operating
profit to NKr67m from NKr21m.
The advance was attributed to stable freight rates for oil products from
North Africa to Europe and the US, and to higher rates for dry bulk cargoes
such as grain, coal and phosphates.
The group's car-carrier operation saw operating profit decline to NKr115m
from NKr128m, mostly because of the disposal of two vessels and a weaker
trend in the market.
