FT  17 JAN 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries' slide continues despite
encouraging data

   NEW YORK, LONDON


THE SLIDE in US Treasury prices continued yesterday morning, despite good
news on inflation.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 15/16 at 104
1/16, yielding 7.646 per cent. The two-year note was also easier, down  1/32
at 99 29/32 , yielding 5.033 per cent.
The market firmed in early trading, thanks primarily to the Labor
Department's report that the consumer price index rose just 0.3 per cent in
December.
The number was in line with market expectations, although a 0.4 per cent
gain in energy prices was bigger than forecast. Overall, though, the news on
prices was good, and should have provided support for the bond markets.
Bond prices soon turned around, however, partly in response to a 49,000
decline in weekly state unemployment claims, but mostly because the market
does not have the stomach, at least for the moment, for further gains.
UK GOVERNMENT bonds rallied strongly on the mortgage rate cuts and
unemployment figures announced yesterday. Much of the gain, however, was
wiped out as the US Treasury market's fall pulled gilt prices lower.
Trading was mainly futures-driven, with the Liffe gilt futures contract
climbing to a high of 97.26 from its opening of 97.03, before settling at
97.14 in the late afternoon. The volume in the Liffe futures contract was
double the normal level at 42,000 contracts.
The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 gained nearly half a point at
one stage, from its opening level of 115 9/16 , but fell back to 115 3/4 by
late afternoon.
The news that Abbey National and Halifax, the two largest UK
mortgage-lenders, were cutting their mortgage rates, and the release of
unemployment figures which showed a slowdown in the rate of increase, were
both seen by the market as positive for the government.
THE WEAKENING in US Treasury bond prices helped to pull down the European
government bond markets, wiping out earlier gains.
In Germany, the cash and futures markets closed lower. The Liffe bund
futures contract, which opened at 88.38, fell from a high of 88.44 to close
at 88.16 on a volume of 46,000 contracts. Traders reported strong demand for
five-year bunds earlier in the day, but said the US Treasury bond market's
fall prompted considerable volatility towards the close of trading.
In the French market, government bonds fell  1/3 of a point in
futures-dominated trade, wiping out the gains made on Wednesday. The March
bond future ended at 108.72, down 36 basis points, on a volume of 139,184
lots.
JAPANESE government bonds ended the day unchanged in Tokyo in dull trading.
The yield on the benchmark No 129 issue closed at 5.395 per cent, having
traded in a range of 5.385-5.415 per cent.
The Bank of Japan drained funds from the money market yesterday on the first
day of the new reserve period for banks. The overnight call money rate
inched up to 5 17/32 per cent, while three-month certificates of deposit
remained at 5.28 per cent, traders said.
