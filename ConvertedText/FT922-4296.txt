FT  06 JUN 92 / Torus scientists vote for strike


ALMOST 200 scientists on the Joint European Torus project based in Abingdon,
Oxfordshire, voted by a three-to-one majority for strike action.
The IPMS Civil Service union said this was the latest step in a 10-year
battle for pay parity with European colleagues on Torus who earn twice as
much.
