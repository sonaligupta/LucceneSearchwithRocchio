FT  12 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow outperformed by small
growth stocks

   NEW YORK


Wall Street
AFTER A weak opening, US share prices posted modest gains, although
small-capitalisation growth stocks traded on the Nasdaq system once again
outperformed the wider market, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 14.86 firmer at 3,240.33, buoyed by
heavy demand for drug stocks. The Standard & Poor's 500 gained 3.58 at
422.20, while the American SE composite put on 3.15 at 388.81. The Nasdaq
composite advanced afresh by 7.16 to 634.92 in active trading. Turnover on
the New York SE was very heavy at 243.7m shares.
Outside influences on the market were scarce, with no economic statistics of
importance due for release, and the bond markets closed for the Veterans Day
holiday.
The pattern of the first two days of the week was repeated, with blue chips
struggling to make headway amid active two-way trading but secondary stocks,
especially more spec-ulative issues traded over the counter which attracted
extremely strong demand, registering decent gains on steady investor demand.
Profit-taking continued to plague some leading cyclical stocks, especially
those that had benefited from demand linked to the Presidential election. In
the weeks running up to the November 3 poll, investors had bought into
cyclical shares that were expected to benefit from a new Democratic
administration's plans for increased government spending. By the start of
this week, those same investors had begun to book some of the profits earned
during the run-up to polling day.
Among the cyclical shares, International Paper lost a further Dollars 1/4 to
Dollars 62 7/8 after broking house Bear Stearns lowered its rating on the
stock from 'attractive' to 'hold'. The broker also reduced its earnings
estimates because of concern over the sluggishness of the white paper
business and the company's exposure to weakening European markets. Westvaco,
another paper company also downgraded by Bear Stearns, slipped Dollars  5/8
to Dollars 35.
Pharmaceuticals, especially those recently hit by selling on fears that a
Clinton administration would put controls on drug prices, rallied strongly.
Johnson & Johnson moved up Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 50 3/8 , Pfizer Dollars
2 1/2 to Dollars 77 1/8 and Merck Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 44 7/8 .
Federated Department Stores firmed in early trading but slipped back to end
steady at Dollars 16 7/8 in turnover of 2m shares after the retailer
reported third-quarter net income of Dollars 31.6m, a dramatic turnround
from the Dollars 61m loss incurred at the same stage a year ago.
Other retailers were also firmer, boosted by signs of a modest recovery in
sales. Sears appreciated Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 43 3/4 , JC Penney Dollars
 7/8 to Dollars 76 3/8 and The Gap Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 31 1/4 . The
exception was Wal-Mart, down Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 62 after seeing its
stock rating cut by PaineWebber.
On the Nasdaq market, Nordstrom jumped Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 35 1/4 as
investors applauded the company's 29 cents a share third-quarter profit, an
improvement on the 24 cents earned in the 1991 period.
Canada
TORONTO was steadier, bolstered by a rally in Canada's heavyweight gold
shares and strength in pharmaceuticals.
The TSE 300 index gained 9.2 at 3,286.4, although declines slightly
outnumbered advances by 259 to 251 after volume of 25.1m shares. Dealings
were thin due to a Remembrance Day bank holiday in Canada and the US
Memorial Day.
