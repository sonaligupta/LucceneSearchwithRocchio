FT  05 AUG 92 / People: Counter moves posted


After little more than a year as boss of Parcelforce, 56-year-old Peter
Howarth (left) has been brought back in to the mainstream business of the
Post Office and been put in charge of the Royal Mail, which earns the bulk
of the PO's profits.
The return of Howarth, who joined the PO in 1953 and had been Royal Mail's
assistant managing director, is the most important of a series of top
management changes following 49-year-old Bill Cockburn's appointment as the
PO's next chief executive. It is also a further sign that the sale of the
loss-making Parcelforce parcels business is imminent.
John Roberts (right), Cockburn's rival for the chief executive's job,
remains managing director of Post Office Counters whose turnover is around a
quarter of the size of the Royal Mail.
However, Roberts, 48, is to take on wider responsibilities at group level.
He will assist Cockburn on the planned sale of Parcelforce and will help
formulate the PO's response to the government's recently-announced review of
the future of the PO. He will also take over the group responsibilities of
Ken Young, the PO deputy chairman, when he retires at the end of this year.
Richard Dykes, a 47-year-old ex-civil servant who joined the PO in 1986 and
is currently director of operations of Post Office Counters, becomes acting
deputy managing director of that company. He will be responsible for its
day-to-day management and will report to Roberts on major issues.
Meanwhile, 43-year-old Malcolm Kitchener, Parcelforce's financial director,
seems to have made the right move when he quit Fisons and joined the public
sector 18 months ago. He becomes Parcelforce's acting managing director.
However, unlike his predecessor he has not been given a seat on the PO
board.
