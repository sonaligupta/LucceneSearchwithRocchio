FT  21 NOV 92 / Society sues ombudsmen


   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU


ALLIANCE & Leicester, the third-largest building society, is taking legal
action against the building society ombudsmen, the industry's watchdogs, and
suing two individual investors 'to clarify certain issues relating to the
ombudsmen scheme', particularly the scope of the ombudsmen's jurisdiction.
The specific issue is that of obsolete accounts - those that are no longer
being marketed. Many investors complain when their savings account is
replaced with a new one and the rate of interest paid on the obsolete
account is reduced. Investors are often unaware that their account has
become obsolete.
The Alliance & Leicester has issued a writ claiming that the ombudsmen are
not entitled to investigate its Gold Plus, Ready Money Plus and Ordinary
Share accounts - all instant-access accounts now closed to new savers.
The three building society ombudsmen say they are required to consider all
complaints within their terms of reference, and especially to consider
whether a complainant has be unfairly treated. 'This includes looking at the
interest rates set by a society on the complainant's account.'
