FT  06 AUG 93 / UK Company News: DCC offer values Flogas at IPounds 79.4m


   By PAUL TAYLOR


DCC, the Dublin-based private industrial holding company founded and run by
Mr Jim Flavin, yesterday bid 325p a share to lift its 29.9 per cent stake in
Flogas, the publicly quoted Irish distributor of liquefied petroleum gas, to
60.1 per cent.
The bid values Flogas, which is the UK and Ireland's second largest supplier
of LPG, at IPounds 79.4m (Pounds 74.5m). Its shares closed at 240p.
Yesterday Flogas directors, who are recommending the partial cash offer,
estimated that the group would report a pre-tax profit of IPounds 6.5m for
the six months to June 30, equivalent to earnings per share of 23.3p. The
offer price represents a multiple of 13.9 times estimated earnings.
In the 13 months to June 30 last year Flogas reported pre-tax profits of
IPounds 7.2m and earnings per share of 23.9p.
DCC, which has interests in five core sectors including the energy and waste
oil management sector, said it was making the partial bid to expand its
interests in this area.
Under the terms of the offer, Powerimpact, a subsidiary of DCC in which the
executive directors and another executive of Flogas will have a 20 per cent
minority interest, is bidding for up to 7.37m Flogas shares.
Flogas shareholders, other than DCC which already holds 7.32m Flogas shares,
who accept the offer will be assured of receiving 325p for up to 43 per cent
of their individual holdings. Flogas directors hold 1.87m shares, equivalent
to a 7.6 per cent stake.
DCC said that Flogas would retain its existing executive and non-executive
directors and management.
The committee of independent Flogas directors, advised by SG Warburg, has
said that it considered the partial offer to be fair and reasonable and have
unanimously recommended it.
