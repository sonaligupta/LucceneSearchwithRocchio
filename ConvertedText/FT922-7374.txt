FT  19 MAY 92 / International Company News: NKK re-emphasises steel
operation

   TOKYO


NKK, the Japanese steel company, yesterday announced a new long-term
management plan that re-emphasised the importance of its core steel-making
business, and conceded that new business areas would contribute less to
profits than previously forecast.
The company also said it had agreed to a 50-50 joint venture with Bethlehem
Steel of the US to produce treated sheets for the US construction industry.
The joint venture, formed through a US subsidiary of NKK, National Steel
Corp (NSC), is expected to have capital of around Dollars 16m and to employ
85 workers.
Japanese steel producers have been concerned by a US industry plan to pursue
an anti-dumping action against Japanese and other foreign companies, and it
is hoped in Tokyo that the Bethlehem deal will ease tension between the two
industries.
In 1988 NKK announced a long-term plan for the year 2000. At the time of the
announcement, Japanese steelmakers were drafting restructurings designed to
reduce their reliance on steel products and increase new business
activities.
These plans had been prompted by a sharp decline in national steel
production, from 105m tonnes in 1985 to 98m tonnes in 1986. Demand then grew
sharply in tandem with the rapid expansion of the Japanese economy in the
late 1980s.
In the original plan, NKK expected new businesses would account for 25 per
cent of annual sales by the year 2000, but that figure has been revised
downward to 16 per cent.
Engineering business is expected to account for 31 per cent of sales, up
from the forecast 25 per cent; steel is expected to account for 53 per cent,
up from 50 per cent.
Steel companies had predicted that urban development projects would be a
prime source of income, but NKK has halved its expected earnings in that
sector by the year 2000 to Y100bn (Dollars 746.2m).
Companies were planning to develop old factory sites and under-utilised
land, but property development is no longer seen as a promising area of
growth with the plunge in land prices.
