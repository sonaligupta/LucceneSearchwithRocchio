FT  17 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Polish shipyard deal threat


   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI


   GDYNIA


HIGH insurance costs are threatening a big contract worth Dollars 90m
(Pounds 50m) won by Poland's Gdynia shipyard to build two tankers for
Burmeister and Wain from Denmark.
The contract for the two 90,000-tonne Aframax vessels, which marks a key
step towards recovery for the debt-burdened yard, was signed in mid-November
by the Danish shipping and ship-building company.
The Danes, however, are finding that the high costs of insuring the 75 per
cent down payment on the vessels, which are due for delivery at the end of
1993, could mean they will take the order elsewhere.
Ironically, Mr Henryk Ogryczak, the Gdynia yard's managing director, notes
that the problem comes as the yard is emerging from a time of considerable
uncertainty.
The new Polish government has adopted a more interventionist approach to
industry than its predecessors.
Indeed, Mr Andrzej Olechowski, the deputy trade minister, has said,
referring to the Burmeister contract: 'Our shipyards are an important part
of Poland's export capacity and they must not be permitted to disappear.'
The Gdynia yard continued to be modernised until the end of the 1970s, when
shipyards elsewhere were being closed.
Mr Ogryczak, who left the yard in 1985 to start up his own business and
returned last year as managing director, is negotiating a restructuring of
Gdynia's Zl 2,000bn (Pounds 98m) debt with its creditors, who include the
government, suppliers and banks. He has also set in train plans to rent out
the yard's spare storage at maintenance capacity. The yard at the moment is,
among others, building three 150,000 tonne bulk carriers for Dreyfuss from
France and two 90,000 tonne tankers for Zenith of the UK. The value of
Gdynia's present orders exceeds Dollars 200m (Pounds 112m).
