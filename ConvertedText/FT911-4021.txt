FT  22 APR 91 / Money Markets: Political risks


STERLING HAS moved from the bottom of the European exchange rate mechanism
to be second strongest within a short space of time, leading to attacks on
the DM3.00 level against a generally depressed D-Mark. This poses the
question of how much higher the pound is likely to go and in this context it
has to be admitted that levels of DM2.9250, DM2.9500 and DM2.9750 proved no
barriers to the advance.
An attack on DM3.00 failed early last week but when the German Bundesbank
left interest rates unchanged at its council meeting sterling edged up
towards DM3.00 again.
The strength of both the wide ranging currencies in the ERM, sterling and
the Spanish peseta, has led to suggestions that they may soon move to the
narrow 2.25 per cent band.
Reaction from the UK Treasury was to refer back to the chancellor of the
exchequer's Budget speech. At that time Mr Norman Lamont said it was his
long term intention, but there were no plans for the time being.
This still appears to be the government's policy during a period when
sterling could become vulnerable to political risk. Local government
elections take place in England and Wales next week, amid expectations that
the results will influence the timing of a general election.
If Conservative candidates do well locally it will increase speculation
about a June election. Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor has tried hard
to dispel the idea that Labour is the party of devaluation, but foreign
investors are likely to remain nervous. On the other hand a return to power
of the Conservatives is unlikely to provoke a strong surge in the value of
the pound, which tends to leave most of the risk on the downside at present.
