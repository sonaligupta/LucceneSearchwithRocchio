FT  29 APR 94 / UK Company News: British Land Quantum buy


   By SIMON DAVIES


Total property investments of the British Land Quantum Fund have been taken
up to Pounds 500m with the Pounds 70.5m purchase of a freehold building at
122 Leadenhall Street, in the City of London, writes Simon Davies.
Mr John Ritblat, British Land chairman, said the property, bought from Union
Bank of Switzerland, offered an excellent location at an attractive price.
Average rents were about Pounds 30 per sq ft, but there are large rent-free
periods on some leases. The building had been substantially refurbished
following the damage from the IRA bomb explosion in 1992.
The property, with a net area of almost 180,000 sq ft, is 80 per cent let to
Banque Indosuez and is believed to be on a yield of 7.5 per cent.
The purchase follows the fund's acquisition of the Pounds 19.2m Barwell
Business Park and the Pounds 128m purchase of a portfolio from Royal
Insurance.
The fund was formed last June between British Land and Mr George Soros as a
Pounds 500m investment partnership, but it is looking to invest up to Pounds
1bn in the UK property market.
In addition to its property holdings, the fund will also hold the British
Land stake in Stanhope. It plans to use this in an attempt to buy Broadgate
Properties.
