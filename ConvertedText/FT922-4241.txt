FT  06 JUN 92 / Finance and the Family: At a glance - Unit trusts find
favour


The result of the UK general election and the higher limit for unit trust
Peps led to the highest sales of unit trusts for 12 months in April,
according to the Unit Trust Association. Total sales were exactly Pounds
1bn, while the total number of unit trust accounts held rose for the first
time since June 1990.
Funds under management grew to Pounds 59.36bn, the highest figure since
October, up from Pounds 55.98bn in March, and aided by strong stock market
performance. Increased demand for Peps also helped - about 230,000 new unit
trust Peps were opened in the last three weeks of April, while net
investment, at Pounds 151m, was the most on record for any month since sales
of Peps began.
