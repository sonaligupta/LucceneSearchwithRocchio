FT  28 SEP 94 / Debt plan set for controversy


   By PHILIP COGGAN


   VALLETTA, MALTA


Commonwealth finance ministers are likely to welcome the UK's initiative on
debt relief when they issue a communique at the end of their meeting in
Malta today.
UK chancellor Mr Kenneth Clarke has proposed that the debt burden of poor
countries be relieved by extending the Trinidad terms, which cover bilateral
debt, to debt owed to financial institutions such as the International
Monetary Fund.
The debt relief programme would be financed by sales of up to 10 per cent of
the IMF's Dollars 40bn of gold reserves.
While the support of the Commonwealth countries will be welcomed by the UK,
it is likely to face serious opposition at the IMF meeting in Madrid next
week.
Some nations will be cautious about the gold sales, since this will be
perceived as weakening the creditworthiness of the IMF.
