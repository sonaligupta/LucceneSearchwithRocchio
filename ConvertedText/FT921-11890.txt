For the six months to September 30 Etonbrook Properties achieved pre-tax
profits of Pounds 300,366, against Pounds 1.52m last time after property
sales of Pounds 11.8m.
Turnover comprised only rental income. There were no property sales this
time.
Mr Jonathan Harris, chairman, said that a liquidator had been appointed to
one of its tenants which would result in a loss of some Pounds 53,000 in
rental income in the second half, although he added that a new tenant was
being sought. Total rental income for the first half amounted to Pounds
317,453 (Pounds 342,488).
Earnings fell from 30.1p to 4.5p. There is no dividend.
