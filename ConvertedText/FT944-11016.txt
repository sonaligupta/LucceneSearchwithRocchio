slides


   By BETHAN HUTTON


Henderson Administration, the fund management group, increased pre-tax
profits by 22 per cent to Pounds 11.2m for the six months to September 30,
compared with Pounds 9.2m last time.
Funds under management and administration increased from Pounds 12.2bn to
Pounds 13.7bn. Inflow of net new funds was Pounds 401m in the six-month
period and Pounds 981m over the year.
The strongest growth areas were retail funds, particularly investment trusts
and peps, and international funds, which rose from Pounds 984m at March 31
to Pounds 1.4bn. Funds under administration - mainly retail funds managed in
Luxembourg for banks to market under their own names - grew from Pounds
1.4bn to Pounds 1.6bn over the six months.
Pension funds under management slipped from Pounds 5.1bn at end-September
1993 to Pounds 4.7bn 12 months on.
Mr Ben Wrey, chairman, said: 'Reversing the flow of funds from our pension
fund company is among our highest priorities.' Part of the strategy for this
is the appointment of Mr Dugald Eagie as managing director of Henderson
Pension Fund Management.
Further expansion of the international division is planned, with another
office, probably in south-east Asia, likely to open within a few months. Mr
Jeremy Edwards, managing director, added that the group was not ruling out
further acquisitions after the Touche Remnant takeover.
The interim dividend is 13.5p (12.5p), payable from earnings of 36.37p
(28.23p). 'Barring unforeseen circumstances' last year's final of 31.5p will
at least be maintained.
