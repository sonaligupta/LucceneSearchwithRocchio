FT  22 DEC 92 / Arts: Today's Television


   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY


We are in that dreadful pre-Christmas period when the broadcasters unload
the dud movies which they bought in packages along with the good ones they
are reserving for the high days and holidays. There are at least six duds
tonight, and the only offerings of any note are the last in the
Troubleshooter 2 series, and John Huston's film The Treasure of the Sierra
Madre.
In Troubleshooter 2 Sir John Harvey-Jones casts his eye over the old Ipswich
brewery Tolly Cobbold, bought a couple of years ago by two enthusiastic
entrepreneurs who wanted to save it from closure (9.50 BBC2).
The Huston film is not his best, nor Humphrey Bogart's either, but
considering its technical limitations this story of gold prospectors falling
out is remarkably gripping (11.45 BBC1).
If you want to understand the low standard of British audience participation
talk shows watch Donahue: The 25th Anniversary (11.55 ITV). Where the object
on a British show such as 'Kilroy' seems to be heat and controversy, Donahue
thinks on his feet.
Of course American willingness to discuss ultimate intimacies in public
helps.
