ISS, the industrial cleaning group which plans a listing on the New York
Stock Exchange this year, reported an increase in pre-tax profits to DKr593m
(Dollars 60m) in 1993 against DKr377m in 1992.
Net profits advanced to DKr462m from DKr266m, while turnover was up at
DKr13.30bn from DKr11.35bn, of which 38 per cent was in the US, 35 per cent
in Scandinavia and 24 per cent in Europe. Group employment increased to
125,900 from 115,000.
The group said the 17 per cent advance in turnover and 13 per cent increase
in operating profits took place while important markets such as Finland and
Sweden were in recession and against a background of currency turbulence.
The Swedish and Finnish currencies depreciated against the krone by around
20 per cent.
The Dollars 93.5m acquisition of the National Cleaning Group of the US on
June 1 doubled the size of the group's North American operations. An
unchanged DKr10 per share dividend will be paid, but after a one-for-five
subscription issue last year the total pay-out increases to DKr51.9bn from
DKr43.3bn.
The East Asiatic Company, the trading group with extensive interests in East
Asia, moved back into the black with a net profit of DKr144m in 1993
compared with a loss of DKr1.18bn in 1992.
Profit after net financial items increased to DKr275m from a 1992 loss of
DKr128m. Sales were up at DKr11.12bn from DKr10.29bn for the companies
continuing in the group. The group has restructured over the past 18 months,
selling off its container line shipping services and the Plumrose food
processing companies in the UK, the USA, Australia and New Zealand.
