FT  30 APR 94 / Banks seek to restrict societies


   By ALISON SMITH


Leading banks have launched a campaign to stop building societies being
given a new range of freedoms as a result of the government's review of the
Building Societies Act 1986.
The British Bankers' Association has submitted a memorandum to the Treasury
which argues that the existing regulatory regime for societies is justified,
given their unique privileges.
The association argues that changes to societies' powers should be looked at
on the merits of each case, but that the legal framework - which some
societies want removed - should be retained so long as they are mutual
organisations.
In recent months competition between banks and building societies for market
share in mortgage lending and for retail deposits has intensified.
The review was announced in January as part of the government's
de-regulation initiative. The first conclusions, which are due to be
released next month, are expected to include an increase in the ceiling on
the amount of money that societies can raise on the wholesale markets, from
40 per cent to 50 per cent.
They are also expected to reduce the need for societies to communicate
individually with their millions of members in some circumstances.
Abbey National and TSB have been among the most vocal banks arguing that
societies should not receive greater freedoms without having to become more
accountable to their members.
While the emphasis in the association's memorandum is on maintaining the
existing restrictions, some banks would like to see the rules on takeovers
relaxed.
Mr Peter Birch, chief executive of Abbey National, has proposed ending the
power of societies' boards to block an offer from another organisation by
refusing to put it to society members for a decision.
