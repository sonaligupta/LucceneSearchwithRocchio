FT  25 AUG 92 / Surinam arms handover


   By CANUTE JAMES


REBEL groups in Surinam are surrendering weapons to representatives of the
Organisation of American States following a peace agreement with the
government, writes Canute James.
The deal ended eight years of civil unrest in the republic, which forced
thousands of Surinamese to seek refuge in French Guyana. Mr Ronny Brunswijk,
leader of Jungle Commando, the main rebel group, said democracy and civil
rights for the country's bush negroes had either been achieved or promised.
The truce promises economic relief for the former Dutch colony of 400,000
people. At the height of the fighting, three years ago, rebel groups
targeted bauxite mines and refineries and electricity generating stations,
setting back the already weak economy.
The government has agreed to establish special economic zones to benefit
communities which supported the rebels.
