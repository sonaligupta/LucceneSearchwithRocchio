FT  16 DEC 94 / Caracas takes over more banks


   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor


   CARACAS


Venezuela's banking crisis this week claimed another victim, as the
government took over the Grupo Latinoamericano, a conglomerate of 43
financial and other companies, because of troubles at the two banks it
owned.
The two banks in the group controlled by Mr Orlando Castro - Republica and
Progreso - will continue operating. They were taken over following the
failure to service loans made earlier this year by government agencies in an
attempt to prop up the bank and, more recently, settlement difficulties. The
group 'had a liquidity problem and a solvency problem,' according to Finance
Minister Julio Sosa.
The takeover means the state now owns about 70 per cent of the banking
system, following a crisis which erupted at the start of the year.
Ironically, the first bank to go under - Banco Latino - reopened its doors
this week, as did its Edge Act subsidiary in Miami.
Mr Sosa said in an interview that he believed the crisis was drawing to a
close. 'I think we are more or less getting to the end of it. People now
realise that their deposits are OK.' Government policy now is to keep the
banks operating.
