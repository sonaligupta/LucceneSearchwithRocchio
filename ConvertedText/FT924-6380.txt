FT  21 NOV 92 / UK Company News: National Grid shares will not be floated


   By MICHAEL SMITH


THE 12 regional electricity companies (RECs), which own the National Grid,
yesterday decided against selling shares in the company.
National Grid Holdings, which is made up of representatives from the 12,
said in a brief statement that after extensive board discussion it had
decided listing the shares would be inappropriate.
A flotation had been under consideration for several months. Some of the
RECs had been pressing strongly for it, though the uncertainty surrounding
the industry during the pit closures review had made an immediate move
unlikely.
Many shareholders will nonetheless be disappointed. Mr Chris Rowland,
electricity analyst for Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said he would be very
disappointed if a listing had been ruled out on principle.
The RECs would be passing up the opportunity to add value of about 80p per
share, he said. As a result some shareholders would sell their holdings
earlier than they would otherwise have done, he maintained.
The 12 companies each control between 5.5 and 12.5 per cent of the National
Grid Company's shares. Supporters of a flotation say it would release funds
for distribution to shareholders.
Opponents say it would antagonise politicians and the electricity industry
regulator.
