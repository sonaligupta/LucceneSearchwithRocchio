FT  20 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: UBS returns to the Japanese
bond business

THE launch this week by Union Bank of Switzerland of SFr300m in 2 3/4 per
cent notes for Daiwa House Industry marks the return of the country's
largest bank to the Japanese section of the Swiss franc bond market after
being effectively blackballed for several months.
'UBS is proud to be mandated by a prestigious issuer like Daiwa House, and
we are looking for further business,' Mr Arthur Wulkan, senior
vice-president of UBS, said.
The row developed as a result of some peculiar customs in bond issuing for
Japanese companies in Switzerland. The main problem is that Japanese banks
and securities companies closely associated with an issuer get large
allocations even if they have no real placing power.
They then tend to sell their bonds quickly in the market. When conditions
are fair, this is an opportunity to make easy profits, but when conditions
turn sour, as they did last year, it means the lead manager has to become a
buyer of last resort.
The unhappiness of the big Swiss banks with this practice came to a head
when several Japanese financial houses sold their allocations of an issue
led by UBS for Takashimaya, the leading department store group, in a grey
market even before the issue was launched.
An angry UBS abruptly cancelled their allocations, leaving them unable to
fulfil their grey market sales contracts. The bank then followed up by
setting new rules for its syndicates to prevent the grey market action.
Some of these rules, notably insisting on an alphabetical listing of
syndicate members, offended Japanese sensitivities, and the entire Japanese
financial community retaliated by effectively blackballing UBS. The bank,
which ranked a strong third among book runners last year with SFr1.76bn in
issues, had not led a single one this year until the Daiwa House issue.
UBS eased its tough stance in April, saying it would respect Japanese
customs and 'show appropriate flexibility'.
A leading Japanese securities company official in Zurich said yesterday he
thought the big Japanese banks would continue to try to convince their
clients not to use UBS as a lead manager. However, Japanese securities
companies tended to sympathise with UBS.
