FT  01 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Negative asset value at Gresham House


   By ANGUS FOSTER


GRESHAM HOUSE, the investment trust specialising in unquoted companies and
property, had a negative net asset value at December 31.
Gresham, which yesterday announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 8.87m (Pounds
16.7m) for the year, said its net asset value per share collapsed to minus
18p on December 31, against a value of 129p a year earlier.
The announcement was issued after the stock market closed, and the shares
were unchanged at 18p.
The loss included Pounds 6.92m of unspecified exceptional losses. Last year,
Gresham's exceptional losses were Pounds 15.1m as some of its larger
holdings were put into receivership or hit by recession.
The company said discussions with its bankers about an Pounds 8.5m
refinancing were continuing 'satisfactorily'. But it warned shareholders
that any break-down in negotiations would 'make it very difficult for your
board to continue the group's operations'.
Dividend and interest income from investments fell sharply to Pounds 471,000
(Pounds 2.05m), although rental income improved to Pounds 1.35m (Pounds
1.22m). A sale of property investments is scheduled to continue, the company
said.
But Gresham's property development company has been placed into
administrative receivership following a dispute with Customs and Excise. The
property arm has therefore, in line with accounting standards, been
deconsolidated from the group's balance sheet, although consolidated in its
profit and loss account, the company said.
In separate litigation regarding a finance company, Gresham intends to
appeal to the House of Lords against a recent unfavourable ruling.
There was an extraordinary gain of Pounds 2.34m following over-provisioning
in previous years. The loss attributable to shareholders was Pounds 6.48m
(Pounds 16.8m). Losses per share totalled 208.3p (395.9p). No dividend is
recommended.
