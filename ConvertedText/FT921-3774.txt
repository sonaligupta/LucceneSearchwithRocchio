FT  12 MAR 92 / Election '92: Plan to speed up actions over debts


   By CHARLES BATCHELOR


THE Lord Chancellor's Office yesterday announced a five-point plan to
improve the handling of claims for the payment of debts made under county
court small-claims procedures. The proposed changes are due to take effect
in July.
This followed the Budget announcement of plans to simplify court procedures
for the recovery of debts. Ministers have faced many complaints from
business organisations that slow payments were putting companies out of
business.
The planned changes involve:
Dispensing with preliminary hearings in all but the most exceptional cases
so claims can be dealt with at a single hearing.
Changing court procedures so judges can help litigants who are not legally
represented to put their case.
Allowing claimants to be represented in court by someone who is not a
lawyer. This could include a Citizens' Advice Bureau official, an accountant
or a family member. Providing better information on reclaiming expenses.
Requiring judges to explain orally their decisions.
Claims for the repayment of debts make up 90 per cent of all civil actions.
Most are dealt with in county courts under the small-claims procedure. The
maximum size of claim which can be dealt with under this process was
recently doubled to Pounds 1,000.
The changes were welcomed by the Federation of Small Businesses. It has
campaigned for the courts to take on automatic responsibility for enforcing
judgments. Claimants currently have to return to court if a defendant does
not pay up.
