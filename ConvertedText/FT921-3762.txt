FT  12 MAR 92 / Economic Viewpoint: Pros and cons of Pounds 32bn deficit


   By SAMUEL BRITTAN


If Norman Lamont had rigorously stuck to the balance-over-a-cycle doctrine,
and rejected, as he claimed, the case for giving the economy a kick-start,
then he would not have remitted any taxes at all in net terms. As it is, he
is facing the election as the chancellor who courageously insisted on only a
moderate bribe. Whoever wins the UK election on April 9 will inherit a
mighty Budget deficit. The Pounds 28bn Public Sector Borrowing Requirement -
or Pounds 36bn without privatisation proceeds - is only the beginning. The
Treasury estimate for 1993-94 is Pounds 32bn.
Although these are huge numbers in terms of the money with which most of us
are familiar, a reasonably confidence-inspiring British government of any
party would have no difficulty in financing the coming deficit, if it really
were just the peak resulting from a recession, and it started shrinking fast
in later years.
I do not agree with all the arguments of the cynics, for instance on growth.
The Treasury projects a path for real growth excluding North Sea oil output
of 1 3/4 per cent in the coming financial year, rising to 3 per cent the
year after and averaging 3 1/2 per cent in the middle 1990s.
Why should there not be an output recovery? Taking into account the
recession years, the average growth rate would still be only 2 per cent per
annum over 1990-97. Are the cynics saying that productivity will not rise
enough to support such a growth rate? This is not supported by the data.
Or are they saying that growth at this rate, starting from a very high
unemployment rate, and a substantial margin of unused capacity will lead to
a resumption of inflation? Or are they saying that there is a balance of
payments constraint on growth? The UK in a hard ERM, leading to Emu, has the
same kind of balance of payments constraint as Sussex or Normandy.
Alternatively, will growth be low because the demand will not be there: that
is, people will not spend enough? If that were so, there might be a case for
budgetary red ink after all. Let me, as my computer keyboard would say,
'save' this possibility to discuss below.
Meanwhile there is another and more likely reason why the Treasury forecasts
are too optimistic. This is that they assume no further addition to public
spending plans and no tax remissions before 1995, and then extremely modest
ones. (The forecasters could easily adjust their computers to tax increases
under Labour, coupled with a corresponding boost to spending.)
The dubious assumption is that spending will be limited in this way. An
analysis by Goldman Sachs suggests that Pounds 10bn of next year's PSBR,
representing 1 1/2 per cent of gross domestic product, represents
discretionary increases in spending or tax remissions.
Such political pressures will not come to an end after an election; and they
will be encouraged by the lessening of the automatic penalty on excess
borrowing of a run on sterling which was experienced in the 1960s and 1970s.

It is thus necessary to ask more coolly what harm a Budget deficit does. The
verbal puritanism of City folk, who make a living from lending and
borrowing, is inadequate.
The harm is expressed simply by the slogan: 'Today's borrowing is tomorrow's
taxes.' In other words we will have to suffer the deadweight burden of
raising taxes from one sector of the population to pay as interest to
another. Such transfers and the consequentially high tax rates, do distort
the economy.
If the debt to GDP ratio is rising, the amount of such deadweight transfers
will increase. The maximum borrowing consistent with stability in the ratio
is about 1 1/2 per cent to 2 per cent of GDP or about Pounds 10bn in today's
values. The balanced budget doctrine simply gives a margin of error and
enables us to avoid controversies over issues such as the treatment of items
like privatisation revenues or council house sales. So far so good.
Unfortunately, most of the people who raise the alarm about rising debt and
the Italian-type traps which could emerge, take one thing for granted,
without bothering to argue it. This is that the national income is given and
that servicing extra debt is a pure deadweight burden. This does not answer
but simply ignores the Keynesian argument that a fiscal stimulus raises
output and employment and thus has something real to show in return for the
irritations of the transfer.
But the argument changes radically if a fiscal stimulus really will lead to
more real jobs and output. The gain could far exceed the transfer burden of
the Debt interest.
Let us suppose that there were a problem of demand deficiency. The concept
can be illustrated by the Red Book projections showing a growth of Nominal
GDP of 6 1/2 per cent on the next financial year falling steadily to 5 1/4
per cent by 1996-97. By this time, the hope is that underlying inflation
will be down to 2 per cent, leaving 3 1/4 per cent for real growth. Demand
expansion of much less would leave insufficient headroom for growth.
So the question boils down to whether extra borrowing will generate extra
output or jobs, more than temporarily, or not. Some three years of borrowing
at the current rate would add nearly Pounds 100bn to the National Debt and
cost very roughly Pounds 10bn in gross interest payments. If there were
nothing to show for it in current output, the result would be something like
3p on the basic rate of income tax.
So before resorting to red ink, we need to be sure (a) that extra output
really will result, and (b) that a fiscal stimulus is the best way of
providing it.
The UK's Medium Term Financial Strategy is based on the assumption, as the
Red Book puts it, that growth depends on supply side forces, and by
implication that demand deficiency is temporary and self-correcting. During
every recession voices can be heard saying that this is no longer the case
and that depression is once more a danger. Like the boy who cried 'wolf',
these voices may one day be right, but have up to now been wrong.
One monetarist argument against a fiscal stimulus is out of date. This says
that if a deficit is financed by selling bonds, interest rates will rise,
and the demand stimulus thus be cancelled out. The argument has lost its
force in a liberalised international capital market where the borrowing of
one medium sized government has little impact on international real interest
rates.
There are, however, other reasons for hesitation about using the Budget to
stimulate demand. There is the old argument about dangers of bad timing.
There is the newer one that stimulation may be ineffective in view of the
private sector's tendency to offset tax giveaways by saving more and tax
increases by saving less.
My own way of cutting the Gordian knot is to regard monetary policy as the
main instrument for demand management. It is more flexible, operates with
fewer lags, and does not have the transfer burden associated with fiscal
policy.
None of these arguments lose their force because monetary policy is being
run by the Bundesbank. If it really were the case that a radically different
monetary policy were required in Germany to underwrite growth without
inflation than in other European countries, then indeed the ERM would have
outlived its value.
Experience suggests, however, that very similar forces are at work in most
European countries, even if they operate with a lag; and I can hardly
imagine that a much higher real interest rate would be appropriate east of
the Rhine than west of it. So we are left with a rather low-level case for a
temporary fiscal stimulus while the pressures of German reunification give
Bundesbank policy a restrictive bias.
Given all the many other uncertainties about how far a fiscal stimulus,
going beyond the automatic stabilisers, really helps, and the looming
increase in the deadweight burden of debt interest, I would compromise by
saying that any fiscal injection should take the form of investment - not in
the accounting sense, but in the more fundamental sense of raising the
country's underlying productive capacity. Mr Lamont's remissions were not of
that kind. Nor are the Labour alternatives.
