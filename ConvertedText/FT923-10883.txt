FT  28 JUL 92 / Australia boosts jobs with Pounds 300m scheme

AUSTRALIA'S hard-pressed Labor government yesterday unveiled plans to spend
ADollars 767m (Pounds 300m) over three years to provide training and
subsidised jobs for young workers hit by recession and weak economic
recovery.
Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, said the scheme would cost ADollars
297m this year, ADollars 335m in 1993-94 and ADollars 135m in 1994-95. It
follows a ADollars 720m expansion of technical and further education
announced earlier this year.
The announcement reflects the government's sensitivity to youth unemployment
in the run-up to the next federal election, which must be held by June next
year. The conservative opposition has opened a significant opinion poll lead
over the government since total unemployment reached a record 11.1 per cent
in June. Nearly 36 per cent of workers under 19 are unemployed.
Mr Keating said the employment package would provide a six-month training
course and a subsidised job for young workers unemployed for more than 12
months.
The scheme will also improve existing training and job search allowances,
and finance benefits for young people who join environmental improvement
projects.
The spending programme will not be offset by savings from other elements of
the federal budget, which is expected to be more than ADollars 12bn in
deficit this year, following a deficit of ADollars 9.4bn in 1991-92.
