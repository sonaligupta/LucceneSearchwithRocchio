FT  22 APR 91 / High German demand only bright spot in European car sales
gloom


   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent


NEW CAR sales in western Europe (including eastern Germany) fell by 3.3 per
cent in March, to an estimated 1.32m.
Demand is continuing to surge in Germany, where sales last month jumped by
an estimated 35.5 per cent to about 424,000 (including eastern Germany),
compared with 313,000 in West Germany a year ago.
New car sales in Germany in the first quarter were 44.2 per cent higher than
a year ago, say industry estimates.
Elsewhere demand has plunged, however, and new car sales in the first
quarter in western Europe excluding Germany were an ominous 14.6 per cent
lower than a year ago at 2.54m.
New car registrations in March were lower in 14 of 17 national markets
across western Europe, including, most significantly, four of the five
leading volume markets: Italy, France, the UK and Spain.
While sales in Italy in March were 4.5 per cent lower than a year ago,
demand in the UK plunged by 19.1 per cent, in France by 18.5 per cent and in
Spain by 29.3 per cent.
In the first three months, sales fell in 15 of 17 markets across western
Europe, with increases achieved only in Germany and Greece.
Overall western European new car sales in the first quarter were 2.8 per
cent lower than a year earlier, at 3.62m, but Germany is the sole factor
moderating the decline and accounted for 30 per cent of the total western
European car market in the first quarter.
The diverging fortunes of Germany and the rest of western Europe is leading
to a sharp contrast in the performances of the big six volume car-makers in
Europe.
Volkswagen, General Motors (Opel/Vauxhall) and Ford - the three leading
groups in the German market - have all recorded strong sales increases this
year.
The Peugeot group of France, which includes Citroen, has been hardest hit.
It has slipped from third to fifth place in the western European new car
sales league, falling behind both General Motors and Ford, after suffering
an estimated 14.1 per cent drop in sales in the first quarter. Its market
share has dropped to 11.7 per cent from 13.2 per cent a year ago.
The Volkswagen group, which includes Audi and SEAT, and was the leader of
the western European car market for the past six years, increased its sales
volume by about 8.9 per cent to an estimated 595,000. It boosted its market
share to a record 16.5 per cent, from 14.7 per cent a year ago.
The challenge from the Fiat group, which includes Lancia and Alfa Romeo, has
faded. The Italian car-maker, which has been forced into short-time working
for much of the past eight months at several of its domestic car plants,
suffered a 13.3 per cent fall in new car sales in the first quarter, with
its market share tumbling to 13.3 per cent from 15.4 per cent a year ago.
It is under heavy pressure in the domestic Italian market, where its share
in the first quarter fell to 47.8 per cent from 55.5 per cent a year ago and
58.5 per cent in the first quarter of 1989.
Both GM and Ford succeeded in increasing their sales volumes, helped by
their presence in the German market, and both have made important gains in
European market share.
Both French car-makers lost ground sharply in the first quarter. Renault,
which recently announced an 87 per cent drop in group net profits for 1990,
remains under heavy pressure, with an estimated 8.7 per cent drop in car
sales volume in the first quarter.
