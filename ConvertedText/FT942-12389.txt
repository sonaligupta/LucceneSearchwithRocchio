FT  29 APR 94 / International Company News: Christiania Bank advances 79%

Christiania Bank, Norway's second biggest bank, yesterday reported a rise in
first-quarter net profit to NKr375m (Dollars 51m) from NKr209m in the same
period last year.
It attributed the advance primarily to a lower level of loan losses and a
NKr250m gain from the disposal of the bank's 47 per cent interest in Norsk
Skibs Hypothekbank.
Net interest income fell slightly to NKr744m from NKr779m while non-interest
income declined to NKr595m from NKr699m.
Non-interest income was affected by losses of NKr155m on bonds and
certificates - against a gain of NKr169m in last year's first quarter - as a
result of interest rate upheaval.
Non-interest expenses rose to NKr771m from NKr695m due to allocations of
NKr14m to the Commercial Banks' Guarantee Fund and NKr20m associated with
the takeover of branches in the west coast city of Bergen previously owned
by Fokus Bank, Norway's third biggest commercial bank.
Operating profit, before loan losses, fell to NKr569m from NKr724m, while
provisions for losses on loans and guarantees were cut sharply to NKr191m
from NKr504m. Credit losses in the retail market were low but losses on
loans to the fisheries sector were a burden, it said.
