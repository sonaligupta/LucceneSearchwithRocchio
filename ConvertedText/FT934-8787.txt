FT  13 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Ashley in court move over Spanish claim


   By PEGGY HOLLINGER


ASHLEY Group, the once lossmaking window blinds and timber company, which
recently returned to profit expects to take its legal battle to reclaim
Pounds 20m, for the sale of a Spanish subsidiary, to the courts before the
end of this month.
The company said yesterday that a court date would be set within the next
few days. Mr James White, chairman, said he was confident the court case
would be decided before the end of the year.
Ashley sold Digsa, its Spanish supermarket business, in May for Pounds 53m
to the Hong Kong-based group, Parafax. Of this, Pounds 33m was debt with the
remainder to be paid in four equal instalments, the first payment being due
last week.
The deferred payment was secured on certain assets, which Ashley claims
could be repossessed if Digsa sought protection from creditors similar to
Chapter 11 in the US. Digsa did so in September and Ashley is launching
legal action to reclaim the assets.
Mr White said yesterday he would not even consider the possibility that the
courts could find in Parafax's favour.
Ashley reported interim profits of Pounds 1.6m in September, after losses,
largely incurred on the Spanish retailing side, of Pounds 13.8m.
Three directors associated with the Spanish diversification left the company
last month.
