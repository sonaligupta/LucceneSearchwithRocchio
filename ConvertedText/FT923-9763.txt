FT  04 AUG 92 / International Company News: Battle for LTV arm intensifies


   By MARTIN DICKSON


   NEW YORK


THE long and tortuous battle for ownership of LTV's aircraft and missiles
businesses intensified yesterday when LTV announced plans to sell to Martin
Marietta for Dollars 440m and a rival bidding team, led by Loral and the
Carlyle Group, countered with an offer of Dollars 445m.
The flurry of activity followed last week's announcement that Loral wanted
to buy LTV's missiles business for Dollars 240m. This would be in a joint
bid with the Carlyle Group, a Washington investment firm, and defence
company Northrop, which would bid Dollars 190m for the aircraft side.
The result was a package deal worth Dollars 430m.
However, LTV said yesterday morning that it had reached a preliminary letter
of agreement with Martin Marietta on a Dollars 440m bid, consisting of
Dollars 396m in cash and Dollars 44m in preferred stock.
Last night, Loral said that it and Carlyle would be making a bid of Dollars
445m, of which Dollars 424m would be in cash and Dollars 21m in preferred
stock, which it said was superior to the Martin Marietta deal.
Any final package still needs the approval of the bankruptcy court which
oversees the assets of LTV, which has been in chapter 11 bankruptcy since
1986.
Loral said last night that it hoped that the court would give due attention
to its latest offer.
Martin Marietta first appeared in the bidding in April when, in conjunction
with Lockheed, it made a Dollars 385m bid for the LTV businesses. However,
that bid was rejected by the courts in favour of a Dollars 450m offer from
Thomson-CSF of France and Carlyle.
Thomson withdrew from the bidding process last week, as Loral came in, after
the French company ran into hostility to its bid in Washington, where there
was concern over the possible leaking of US defence secrets to foreign
powers.
