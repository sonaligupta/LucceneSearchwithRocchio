FT  20 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading


   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY


Fierce volatility threw equity derivatives into turmoil as massive swings of
sentiment coursed through the market, writes Christine Buckley.
The head of derivatives at one broking house said that volatility was
'staggering' and had not been seen in such a frenzied form since the last UK
general election.
The June contract on the FT-SE 100 began ascending its rollercoaster track
quite firmly, adding 14 points in early trading after it had opened ahead of
the previous day's close. The big plunge came on upset in the bund market
with the selling so fierce that the contract fell from its intraday high of
3,157 to 3,104 in about two hours.
It mustered a pre-lunch rally before an optimistic opening on Wall Street
sent the next surprise and the contract bounced to 3,150. But nervousness
was quick to return and June fell back to finish at 3,127, trailing the cash
market by several points after taking the fair value carrying costs into
consideration.
Institutions are said to be wary of the extreme volatility with the climate
likely to be enjoyed by only hedge funds. But one market expert cautioned:
'It is impossible to call this market at the moment. No-one knows which way
it is going.'
Options were comparatively quiet with about half of the activity in index
products. Turnover was 35,580 lots.
