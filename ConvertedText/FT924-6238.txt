against the other currencies of the exchange rate mechanism have been
reduced by 6 per cent.
The new Ecu central rates are the following (in units of national currencies

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Spanish and Portuguese governments will implement strictly all the
measures necessary to ensure that the objectives of their convergence
programmes are achieved.
The Spanish government will immediately lift the special measures on some
foreign exchange transactions which it recently imposed. It will give the
highest priority to meeting the budgetary targets and implementing the
structural measures laid down in the convergence programme.
The ministers and governors draw the attention of the two governments to the
vital importance of restraint on the growth of labour costs.
Member states whose currencies are in the exchange rate mechanism will
implement economic and monetary policies in such a way as to improve their
convergence on price stability and ensure the stability of their currencies
within the parity grid.
The agrimonetary consequences of the present realignment will be examined by
the competent bodies.
The new bilateral central rates and the compulsory intervention points in
the exchange rate mechanism will be communicated by the central banks in
time for the opening of foreign exchange markets on 23 November 1992.
