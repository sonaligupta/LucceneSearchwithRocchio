FT  25 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Cost control behind 6% improvement at
Halifax


   By DAVID BARCHARD


PRE-TAX PROFITS at Halifax Building Society, the largest UK mortgage lender,
rose by 6 per cent in the year to January 31 1992 despite the recession. The
improvement was achieved largely by tight control of costs.
Profits after provisions were Pounds 628m, up from Pounds 593m.
Provisions against bad loans soared from Pounds 107m to Pounds 229m, of
which likely losses on house purchase were Pounds 191m (Pounds 56m). The
society gave no details of the number of homes it took into repossession
beyond saying that they were line with the rest of the industry, implying a
likely total of about 10,000 homes.
Mr Jim Birrell, chief executive, said that early in 1991, the society had
decided to cut its cost base and lend at reduced levels in response to the
problems of the mortgage market.
The society's mortgage business contracted during the year, with net lending
falling from Pounds 5.32bn to Pounds 3.92bn, a decline of 26 per cent. The
number of loans made in the year was down from 211,000 to 188,000.
Its share of the UK mortgage market declined from 16 per cent to 14 per
cent.
The society's total lending book grew from Pounds 44.8bn to Pounds 48.5bn.
Retail savings had a good year with a net inflow of Pounds 4.6bn; as a
result the society paid back about Pounds 400m of wholesale funding.
The cost-income ratio for the Halifax Group dropped from 48.5 per cent to
43.6 per cent, the lowest in over a decade. The cost-income ratio for
Halifax's core building society operations dropped to 38 per cent - well
below the industry average.
Mr Birrell said Halifax was pleased to have achieved the reduction without
cutting either staff or capital.
Operating losses on Halifax Estate Agencies were down from Pounds 18.3m to
Pounds 6.6m. Halifax also lost Pounds 3m on the Halifax Visa Card, a joint
venture with Bank of Scotland.
However, one sting in the tail of the results is that they are probably the
last in which the society's total asset size is greater than that of Abbey
National, its faster-growing rival.
Halifax's total assets of Pounds 58.7bn (Pounds 54.1bn) are now only a
whisker ahead of Abbey National's Pounds 57.4bn. On previous form, Abbey
National is now certain to overtake Halifax this year.
