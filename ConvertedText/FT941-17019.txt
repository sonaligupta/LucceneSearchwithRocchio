FT  06 JAN 94 / International Capital Markets: CGIP follows trend with
FFr994m issue

   PARIS


CGIP, the holding company, has become the latest French group to take
advantage of the buoyant Paris financial markets, by announcing a FFr994m
convertible bond issue.
The company, which last year took part in a high-profile deal to raise its
stake in CarnaudMetalBox, the Anglo-French packaging group, is giving
existing investors first claim to the issue by offering them one convertible
bond for every eight shares that they already own.
The new bonds will be priced at FFr1,350 each, against a market price of
FFr1,218 for CGIP shares, which fell FFr32 yesterday.
CGIP's industrial interests include a stake in the Cap Gemini Sogeti
computer services concern. It has been keen to raise new capital since the
CarnaudMetalBox deal, which depleted its cash resources and prompted it to
sell a number of assets.
The CGIP issue follows a recent stream of cash-raising exercises by French
companies. Credit Commercial de France, the banking group, this week
announced a share issue of between FFr1.3bn and FFr1.5bn.
Unedic, the French unemployment benefit fund, has asked banks for proposals
on how best to launch a bond worth up to FFr22bn, Reuter reports from Paris.
