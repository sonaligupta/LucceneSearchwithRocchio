FT  30 OCT 93 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Aluminium prices hit
8-year lows


   By RICHARD MOONEY


THE SHAKY foundations of the aluminium market slipped again this week,
allowing prices for the metal at the London Metal Exchange to subside to the
lowest levels for eight years.
The three months delivery position closed yesterday at Dollars 1,067.50 a
tonne, down Dollars 8.25 on the day and Dollars 47.75 on the week, after the
already-tottering market was shaken by news of another five-figure addition
to the record stocks in exchange warehouses.
Most of the week's fall happened on Tuesday, when long-standing support
around the Dollars 1,100-mark gave way under the weight of gloomy world
economic conditions, the seemingly inexorable stocks rise and continuing
unrestrained exports from the former Soviet Union.
On his return from talks in Brussels, Mr Alexander Shokhin, Russia's deputy
prime minister for foreign economic relations, said in Moscow on Wednesday
that agreement had been reached with the European Commission on the outlines
of a solution to the row over the aluminium exports with which his country
is flooding the world market.
But with details of the agreement's thorniest component, the ceiling to be
set for Russian exports, remaining to be decided the market was able to take
little heart from that.
Although the pace of the fall was slower during the second half of the week
most analysts thought it would only be a matter of time before a bear
assault was mounted on the next technical support area, around Dollars 1,050
a tonne for three months metal. And if that gave way the market could soon
find itself within hailing distance of 45 cents a pound (Dollars 991 a
tonne), which the Anthony Bird consultancy group has identified as 'a
disaster price' that would quickly force western producers to close another
2m tonnes of annual capacity, on top of the 1.4m tonnes already temporarily
shut down.
Early in the week zinc had been among the weakest of the LME contracts, the
three months price falling Dollars 29.50 to Dollars 920 a tonne at one
point. That fall was regained with interest, however, as buyers were
encouraged by persistent, though unconfirmed, rumours that a European
production cut announcement was imminent. At yesterday's close the three
months price stood at Dollars 958.75 a tonne, up Dollars 9.25 on the week.
Lead also recovered from an early decline to end marginally higher on
balance. Support was found on a dip to Dollars 403 a tonne for three months
delivery on Tuesday and with trade buying appearing at Dollars 410 yesterday
the price closed at Dollars 416.50 a tonne, the highest level since early
August.
Dealers explained the the lead market had been helped to shrug off a further
LME stocks rise to a record 293,450 tonnes by continuing bullish sentiment
following Thursday's news of a shutdown at Mexico's Monterrey smelter,
tightness in supplies of concentrates (an intermediate material) and an
upturn in consumer demand.
The tin market fared less well, although the appearance of demand in the Far
East yesterday ensured that the three months price finished more that
Dollars 100 above Tuesday's low of Dollars 4,660 a tonne.
Last week's near-Dollars 200 rise had been wiped out by Monday's close and
the sellers remained in the ascendancy until after Tuesday's announcement
that members of the Association of Tin Producing Countries had agreed at
their meeting in Kuala Lumpur to cut exports by 13 per cent in 1994 to
78,000 tonnes.
Earlier news that China, the world's biggest tin producer, had decided to
join the association made little impact on the then bearishly inclined
market.
At the London bullion market gold prices fluctuated quite violently without
ever threatening to break out of the present narrow trading range. After
alternating rises and falls of up to Dollars 4.50 a troy ounce had been met
by trade selling at the top and bargain hunting at the bottom the price
ended the week just 80 cents up at Dollars 368.80 an ounce.
Silver followed a similar pattern, though in this case the sellers got the
better of the exchanges and the cash price ended 6 cents down at Dollars
4.38 1/2 an ounce.
Coffee futures were in retreat early on at the London Commodity Exchange,
but ended near the top of the week's range.
Technical selling in New York pushed the January position down to Dollars
1,171 a tonne at one stage before the market responded positively to news
that Brazil had approved funding arrangements for the stockpile purchases it
would be required to make under the producers' export retention scheme.
Doubts about Brazil's effective participation in the scheme had been
undermining market sentiment in recent week's.
The January price climbed to Dollars 1,222 a tonne at one stage yesterday
but edged back to close at Dollars 1,210, up only Dollars 5 on balance but
still comfortably above the psychologically significant Dollars 1,200 level.
Cocoa futures peaked early, the March contract touching Pounds 985 a tonne
on Tuesday. With this and subsequent movements towards Dollars 1,000 meeting
strong resistance, however, dealers concluded that the market was becoming
'range-bound' and that some fundamental encouragement would be needed to
provide fresh impetus for the stalled bull run, which many thought still had
a long way to go.
