FT  02 NOV 93 / Debts sink Japanese builder


   By WILLIAM DAWKINS


MURAMOTO Construction yesterday became Japan's biggest financial failure for
more than 45 years when it filed for protection from its creditors, with
debts totalling Y590bn (Pounds 3.7bn).
This is the largest single potential loss to hit Japan's banking system
since the collapse in asset prices began two years ago, sending the economy
into recession.
Leading creditor among the 50 banks exposed to the group is Nanto Bank, the
main regional bank in Nara prefecture, western Japan, where Muramoto, the
country's 24th largest general construction group, is based. Nanto has Y56bn
of loans to Muramoto, compared with a deposit base of Y3,000bn.
It is followed by Daiwa Bank with Y45bn, which has led creditors'
negotiations with the company, Long Term Credit Bank of Japan with Y38bn and
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank with Y28bn.
Muramoto's creditor banks could absorb the loss, a senior Bank of Japan
official said. However, the move could increase banks' caution when lending
is already sluggish.
Teikoku Databank, the private credit research agency, attributed Muramoto's
collapse to the failures of property companies with which it had undertaken
joint developments. Like other property companies across Japan, they were
hit by the prolonged decline in property prices.
Muramoto, an unlisted company capitalised at Y2.4bn and with sales of
Y291.5bn last year, specialised in public works projects. However, it
diversified into golf course construction and property development in the
late 1980s.
