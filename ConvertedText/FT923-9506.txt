FT  05 AUG 92 / Companies House status under attack


   By ANDREW JACK


COMPANIES HOUSE, the government's corporate information agency, has come
under attack for its monopoly position.
Mr Michael Whitwell, chief executive of Jordans, the corporate information
and services group, has written to Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs
minister, to highlight areas he believes need scrutiny.
His letter follows an announcement last month by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade
and industry secretary, that Companies House would be subject to a review of
its operation, role and 'how its work can best be carried out in the
future'. It is expected to start in the autumn. It will consider a range of
options on the agency's future, including full or partial privatisation and
contracting out some activities.
Mr Whitwell's concerns echo those of other private-sector suppliers of
corporate information, who are worried that Companies House has benefited
from its position as the legal depository of information on all of Britain's
1m limited liability companies.
One of the published operating principles of Companies House is that it
'will not abuse its monopoly position as the central source of company
information'. But some bulk users of the information it provides say prices
have risen sharply since it became one of the first executive agencies under
the government's Next Steps initiative in October 1988. Accounts for the
year to March 31 show a surplus of Pounds 1.57m and a turnover of Pounds
32.4m, up from Pounds 20.6m in the previous year. A further Pounds 17m in
income last year was paid directly to the Department of Trade and Industry.
Mr Heseltine left open the possibility of privatising Companies House,
saying at the time of the announcement: 'The government's job is to govern,
not to administer.'
