FT  05 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow climbs after mixed jobs
report

Wall Street
After an indecisive start, US share prices rose across the board yesterday
in the wake of a mixed February employment report that was seen as mostly
positive for equities, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 7.88 at 3,832.30, but
off its high for the day. The more broadly based Standard & Poor's 500 ended
up 1.73 at 464.74, while the American Stock Exchange composite finished 0.83
higher at 466.48 and the Nasdaq composite 5.97 firmer at 790.55. Trading
volume was 312m shares, and rises outpaced declines by 1,271 to 807.
For an increasingly nervous stock market, yesterday's keenly-awaited
February jobs data ultimately proved to be good news. At first, however, it
looked anything but, with bond prices tumbling after the Labor department
announced a 217,000 increase in monthly non-farm payrolls, and a drop in the
civilian unemployment rate from 6.7 per cent to 6.5 per cent.
The rise in payrolls was much bigger than expected, and the decline in the
jobless rate came as a surprise, prompting the bond market to worry that the
strong numbers would persuade the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates
again to stop the rapidly growing economy from pushing up inflation.
A second glance at the data, however, proved more rewarding. Among the
positive aspects were a sharp downward revision in the January payrolls
number and a weaker-than-expected worker earnings figure. Consequently, the
bond market bounced back impressively from its early losses, with the yield
on the benchmark 30-year government bond dropping from above 6.9 per cent to
end near 6.83 per cent.
Stocks also benefited. After a mixed start, share prices turned decisively
higher around mid-morning, and just before midday the Dow was sitting on a
gain of more than 20 points before it edged lower during the afternoon. The
stock market was ultimately pleased with the February jobs report because
while it showed continued strength in the labour market, it was not strong
enough to spook the bond market. Stocks were also cheered yesterday by news
of a 0.3 per cent rise in leading economic indicators.
Among individual sectors, car stocks continued to outshine the wider market.
Chrysler put on Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 59 3/8 , General Motors added
Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 62 1/8 , and Ford climbed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars
65 1/8 .
Financial stocks, which have been hit hard recently by concern about the
impact of rising interest rates on bank and brokerage company profits,
rebounded. Citicorp rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 39 1/2 , Chemical added
Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 36 1/3 , Chase Manhattan firmed Dollars  1/2 to
Dollars 31 1/2 , and NationsBank rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 47 3/4 .
On the Nasdaq market, technology sector leaders were mostly higher, with
Apple up Dollars 1 at Dollars 36 3/4 and Intel up Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars
69 5/8 .
Canada
Toronto stocks closed up on positive sentiment and a slightly higher gold
price.
The TSE 300 composite index rose 28.31 points to 4,398.56 in volume of 61.3m
shares. On the week, the index was up about 35 points.
Utilities, mining and industrial products gained 1.53 per cent, 1.43 per
cent and 1.40 per cent respectively, and banks, consumer products and energy
were flat.
