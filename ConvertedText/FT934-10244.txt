FT  06 NOV 93 / Demolition at Elstree halted


BRENT WALKER, the property and leisure group, has agreed not to carry out
any demolition at Elstree film studios pending the hearing of a High Court
application by Hertsmere Borough Council.
The council is seeking to enforce a planning condition which, it says, binds
the owners to maintaining the 15-acre Hertfordshire complex for film
production until 2015. Mr Justice Lindsay adjourned the case until next
month.
