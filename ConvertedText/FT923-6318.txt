FT  25 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Tough task ahead for Lep chairman


   By JANE FULLER


ONE OF the questions asked of Mr David James, right, at yesterday's Lep EGM,
was whether he would have time for the onerous task he had taken on, bearing
in mind his other chairmanships at Davies & Newman and Eagle Trust, writes
Jane Fuller.
Part of his reply was that 'I probably work not less than an 80-hour week.'
His fees at Lep are Pounds 35,000 a month.
Altogether, the professional charges for the restructuring amounted to
Pounds 10.3m, which Mr James acknowledged might be 'a hard pill to swallow'
for shareholders.
They will have a chance to consider the 1991 accounts at another
extraordinary meeting, once the finalised figures have been signed off by
accountants Touche Ross.
Mr James mentioned that the new board would be reviewing the accounts from
previous years.
There was an 'enormous amount of investigative work' to do to see whether
any of the losses might be recovered. He had brought in a small team of new
executives, who were on subsidiary boards.
Two new non-executive directors would be appointed shortly.
Of the directors facing shareholders with him yesterday, Mr Michael Kirkman,
second from left, was re-elected at the brief annual meeting that followed
the EGM.
Also pictured, from left, are Mr Philip Hampton, a non-executive who was not
standing for re-election, Mr John East, finance director since December
1988, and Mr Peter Percival, company secretary since May 1978.
