FT  21 DEC 92 / Letter: Drafting of multilateral trade organisation is
unacceptable


   From MYRIAM VANDER STICHELE and MICHAEL WINDFUHR


Sir, You rightly draw attention to the problems arising from the creation of
a new multilateral trade body - MTO - in the Uruguay Round ('US poses new
Gatt quandary', December 15). An article of December 16 ('Round and round go
the Uruguay trade reform negotiators') mentions in contradictory way the US
worries about the status of the MTO and its rules, which should curtail US
unilateral actions.
You do not mention, however, concerns recently expressed by more than 150
organisations from more than 30 developing and industrialised countries
dealing not only with the environment but also with development.
They fear that the MTO, which would be outside the United Nations system,
and would collaborate with the International Monetary Fund and the World
Bank, would further concentrate international economic decision making in
the economically powerful industrialised countries. Developing countries and
their populations would be excluded.
The MTO would be the forum for future negotiations with no equitable
decision-making process. It would be an end to any attempt to create an
international trade organisation which takes a more integrated approach to
trade policy and rules. An MTO as currently drafted is unacceptable.
