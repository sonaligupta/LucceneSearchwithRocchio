FT  30 JUN 93 / UK Company News: ICI and Du Pont fibres swap expected
shortly


   By PAUL ABRAHAMS


AN ASSET swap between Imperial Chemical Industries of the UK and Du Pont,
the US group, is expected to be completed within the next few days.
The deal, which involves ICI and Du Pont exchanging their respective fibres
and acrylics businesses, was first announced in April last year, but has
been held up by objections from the American Federal Trade Commission, the
US competition authority. The two companies had originally hoped to conclude
the swap by the end of last year.
However, ICI will not receive the full Pounds 250m provisionally agreed when
the swap was first revealed because of deteriorating trading conditions in
the European fibres market. The sector is suffering from over-capacity,
sluggish demand and poor prices. Demand in the automotive market is
particularly depressed.
The FTC's clearance will prove a relief for other chemicals companies. There
have been fears that efforts to rationalise the industry in some loss-making
sectors could fall foul of competition authorities in the US and Europe.
It remains unclear whether the FTC will insist ICI disposes of any of its
American acrylics operations. These are small, however, and will not prevent
the company becoming the world's largest manufacturer of acrylics with sales
of about Pounds 500m. Du Pont's business has sales of about Pounds 160m.
Du Pont is acquiring fibres operations with sales of about Pounds 600m a
year. The company has had only limited fibres production in Europe, but will
now become one of the leading nylon manufacturers in the continent.
The American company still has to find a buyer for 12,000 tonnes of nylon
carpet production in Europe. The European Commission said the capacity had
to be sold.
