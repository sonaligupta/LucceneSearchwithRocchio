FT  28 APR 94 / International Company News: Unions urge protection for bank
shareholders


   By ANDREW HILL


Italian bank trade unions yesterday called on a new government to protect
small shareholders against the influence of institutional investors on the
boards of Italy's newly privatised banks.
In the last 10 days, the outcome of shareholder meetings at Banca
Commerciale Italiana and Credito Italiano has led to claims that the state
sell-off has concentrated power in the hands of a few institutions, led by
Mediobanca, the secretive Milan merchant bank.
On Tuesday, BCI's new board named Mr Lionello Adler as chairman, following
the unexpected departure of his predecessor at Saturday's shareholder
meeting.
Mr Adler is chairman of Cartiere Burgo, a quoted Italian paper manufacturer
which owns just over 1 per cent of BCI and has strong links with Mediobanca.
The merchant bank is said to have been behind a last-minute decision to
remove BCI's former chairman, Mr Sergio Siglienti, from a list of 14 BCI
directors proposed at the group's shareholder assembly on Saturday.
