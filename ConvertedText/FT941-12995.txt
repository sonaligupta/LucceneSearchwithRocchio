Compaq Computer registered record fourth-quarter and year-end results amid
'unprecedented demand' for its personal computer products. The US company
aims to overtake IBM and Apple Computer to become the world's largest PC
manufacturer by the end of next year.
Net income jumped to Dollars 151m, or Dollars 1.73 a share, well above the
highest Wall Street predictions. In the fourth quarter of 1992, net income
was Dollars 89m, or Dollars 1.10.
Fourth-quarter sales were Dollars 2.2bn, a 55 per cent increase over the
Dollars 1.4bn reported for the same period in 1992.
For the year, the PC manufacturer reported revenues of Dollars 7.2bn, an
advance of 75 per cent over Dollars 4.1bn in 1992 while net income more than
doubled to Dollars 462m, or Dollars 5.35, against earnings of Dollars 213m
or Dollars 2.52 for 1992.
Sales in North America grew by 100 per cent in 1993 to Dollars 3.7bn. In
developing markets including Japan, Latin America and the Pacific rim ,
sales were up 111 per cent at Dollars 800m. European sales grew 61 per cent
in local currencies, but the strengthening dollar reduced growth to 44 per
cent at Dollars 2.7bn. Worldwide, unit shipments reached 3.1m, an increase
of 98 per cent over 1992.
Last week, Compaq revealed plans to expand its manufacturing facility in
Scotland. It is increasing its production in Singapore and opening a
facility in China.
During 1993, the company expanded its distribution adding more than 6,500
third-party re-sellers to total about 16,000 worldwide.
Compaq has made progress toward becoming the world's leading supplier of
PCs, Mr Eckhard Pfeiffer, Compaq president and chief executive said. It held
about a 10 per cent market share. If trends continued, it could overtake
Apple Computer and IBM to become the number one PC manufacturer in 1995, he
predicted.
