FT  21 JUL 94 / US denies setting deadline for Haiti rulers


   By JUREK MARTIN


   WASHINGTON


The US yesterday increased the war of words on Haiti's military leaders but
denied that any deadline had been set for them voluntarily to relinquish
power.
President Bill Clinton, who had been quoted as saying he was 'more
determined than ever' to bring about a change in Haiti's leadership, denied
the existence of a deadline.
So did his special envoy, Mr Bill Gray, whose comments in another interview
had been interpreted as pointing to an October 1 target date. Asked by USA
Today what would happen when the treaty enabling the US to repatriate
Haitians expired in October, he replied, 'Our expectations are that the
'three stooges' will not be in power' by that date. He was referring to Lt
Gen Raoul Cedras, the army chief, Brig Gen Philippe Biamby, army chief of
staff, and Lt Col Michel Francois, who heads the police.
The administration has, meanwhile, begun a new round of talks at the United
Nations that could lead to the authorisation of a UN peacekeeping force in
Haiti, and even UN endorsement of a US-led invasion by a multinational
force.
However, Congressman Bill Richardson returned from Haiti on Tuesday saying
that Lt Gen Cedras might be ready 'to make a move' to avoid a US invasion.
After talks with Mr Clinton yesterday, Mr Richardson said he thought
invasion should be 'a last resort'. Current US policy, he said, 'is working,
economic sanctions are biting, the refugee policy is also working. I think
it's important we be patient.' Other congressmen at the meeting reported no
sense of an imminent US invasion.
But Mr Gray ruled out protracted discussions with the junta. 'We are only
open to one negotiation; when are you leaving?' he said. He was dismissive
about popular US opposition to an invasion: 'You don't make foreign policy
by polls.'
