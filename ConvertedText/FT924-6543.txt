FT  20 NOV 92 / People: New chairman for Forum UK


Baroness Denton, who founded Forum UK, one of Britain's top women's
networks, is stepping up to become president; she is to be replaced as
chairman by Pam Garside (right), who takes over for a two year period.
Forum UK, which has 175 members and is part of the International Women's
Forum, was founded in 1989. Its members meet two or three times a month,
including a regular breakfast at the Ritz. Employment secretary Gillian
Shephard is a member, as is Barbara Mills, director of public prosecutions.
Garside says the most contentious issue she faces in taking over an outfit
that has been 'nurtured from nothing into a flourishing organisation', is
whether or not to hold numbers at the present exclusive level. She is also
keen to forge links with the Continent, pointing out that the international
forum is very much American-dominated, and that there is, for instance, no
off-shoot in Germany as yet.
Garside, who was brought into Forum UK at the beginning, spent 10 years,
until 1989, studying and working in America. She took a masters in hospital
and health care administration from the University of Minnesota, and spent
six years at Health One Corporation, Minneapolis. She now runs her own
consultancy 'New Health'; is director of organisational development at North
West Thames Regional Health Authority; and is a visiting fellow of the
school of management at Imperial College.
