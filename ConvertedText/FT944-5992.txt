FT  01 DEC 94 / 24-hour shopping starts today


Shops will be legally allowed to open 24 hours a day from Monday to Saturday
for the first time from today.
Mr Michael Forsyth, home office minister, announced yesterday that
shop-opening provisions in the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act would
come into force today.
The change comes less than four months after the Sunday Trading Act made
Sunday opening legal.
