FT  02 JUL 92 / UK Company News: ICL buys personal computer distributor


   By ALAN CANE


ICL, the UK-based computer manufacturer in which Fujitsu of Japan has an 80
per cent stake, is spending an initial Pounds 30m to buy Technology, a
leading personal computer distributor.
Its intention is to overtake IBM, Compaq and Dell, the US manufacturers, to
become the dominant supplier of personal computers and open systems in the
UK. It is aiming for sales of more than Pounds 500m within five years.
Technology has reseller agreements with IBM, Compaq and Toshiba, however,
which implies that ICL will, for the first time, be marketing rival products
in competition to its own.
IBM refused to comment yesterday, saying its reaction would depend on ICL's
future strategy for its acquisition.
ICL has a thriving personal computer business based on machines designed and
built by Nokia, its wholly-owned Scandinavian subsidiary, worth Pounds 100m
a year. Its existing direct sales channel is growing at 25 per cent a year
but Mr John Gardner, ICL (UK) managing director, said: 'If we want to be
number one, we will have to grow faster than that. There is a limit to
organic growth.'
Technology, which made pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.3m last year on sales of
Pounds 130m, is privately held. The main shareholder is Schroder Ventures.
The total price of the deal, which could rise to Pounds 40m, will depend on
future performance.
ICL will merge its own third party distribution activities into the company,
which will continue to be run by Mr Derek Lewis, chairman and chief
executive, and his management team. ICL business is expected to comprise
about 45 per cent of Technology's total activities.
The combined group will be the UK's largest personal computer and open
systems reseller and distributor with revenues of some Pounds 250m, ahead of
P&P and Computacentre, its two main rivals.
