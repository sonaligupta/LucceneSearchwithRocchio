   MONTREAL


Nike, the US sports footwear and apparel group, is buying Canstar, Montreal,
the world's biggest ice hockey equipment maker, for CDollars 546m (USDollars
395m) cash.
Canstar's largest shareholders, including chairman Mr Icaro Olivieri, own 46
per cent of the equity and will tender.
Nike's price is CDollars 27.50 per Canstar share compared with Canstar's
share price of CDollars 17 in the market at Tuesday's close.
Nike said Canstar's principal brands, Bauer and Cooper, had global
reputations and would give Nike entry into team sports equipment.
Canstar has a strong position in in-line skating, roller hockey and figure
skating equipment. Nike said Canstar would operate as an autonomous unit
with existing management.
