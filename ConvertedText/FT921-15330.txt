FT  10 JAN 92 / Observer: Collared


Etonians will no doubt be relieved by news from Outer Mongolia that a
fellow-wearer of the old school tie is now out of the Ulan Bator clink where
he was banged up just before Christmas.
Mongolbank International chairman Sukh-Erdene, who was accorded the neckwear
and dubbed an honorary un-official Etonian two years ago, had been arrested
along with the central bank governor over some unpleasantness concerning
Dollars 82.4m (Pounds 45.2m) allegedly missing as a result of bungled
foreign-exchange transactions.
The incident aroused much excitement in Mongolia. The 31-year-old
Sukh-Erdene is great grandson of national hero Sukh-Bator, who led the 1921
revolution. And the descendant's honorary Etonian status is apparently
regarded as scarcely less distinctive.
It was bestowed on him at a Mongolian Embassy reception after he had
recognised the Etonian tie sported by Nicholas Wolfers, group adviser at
Midland Bank. In Outer Mongolia, they apparently still teach bankers to spot
such key characteristics.
