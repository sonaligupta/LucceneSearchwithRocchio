FT  23 APR 93 / Observer: Verdant prose


Officials at the Japanese Finance Ministry seem to be catching a British
disease - the premature spotting of green shoots. They also seem to have
caught another irritating habit - the copious use of cliche. Well to the
fore yesterday were 'light at the end of the tunnel' and the economy
'hitting bottom'.
But the normally conservative ministry lapsed into more typically Japanese
prose when it claimed that 'butterbur buds are beginning to sprout from
underneath the melted snow'.
