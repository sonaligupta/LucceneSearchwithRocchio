FT  15 NOV 93 / Watchdog widens disclosure talks


   By ALISON SMITH


THE SECURITIES and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, will today
embark on a further stage of its consultation on making life insurance sales
agents tell consumers more about policies. It will set out ideas to those
involved in the consultation process about how to present the information
which sales agents will have to provide, such as the cash commissions they
receive.
SIB was told by the Treasury in July to produce draft rules on greater
disclosure by the end of the year. To meet that deadline proposals must be
put to the board meeting in the first half of next month.
The life industry has vigorously resisted the disclosure of commissions.
SIB's task was complicated by the Treasury's decision to require all sales
agents, not only independent financial advisers who sell the products of
many companies, to portray accurately their commission on each sale.
The method of calculating commissions must address the difference between an
independent financial adviser who relies solely on commission, and sales
staff in banks or building societies who receive salaries as well as sales
bonuses.
It must also take account of the costs of the overheads independent advisers
meet from their commissions.
Companies will have to tell consumers by how much their charges are likely
to reduce returns, and how early surrender would affect the value of a
policy. They must also allow low-cost sales outlets to charge less for the
same product than high-cost outlets.
The Treasury's decision followed its review of a report from the Office of
Fair Trading which concluded that proposals on disclosure from SIB,
supported by the life insurance industry, gave prospective customers too
little information to choose products wisely.
