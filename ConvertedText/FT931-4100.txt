FT  12 MAR 93 / Letter: Quality needs a more rigorous standard (2)


   From Mr HARRY MELROSE


From Mr Harry Melrose.
Sir, As the 24th third party assessment body accredited by NACCB, and the
only one established in Scotland, we appreciate the visibility given by
Charles Batchelor.
Public ignorance of the process of accredited certification is indeed the
root cause of the opportunity openings for cowboys. Many believe that the
British Standards Institution controls all assessment and certification
activities including the NACCB, and no difference is perceived between BSI
and its subsidiary, BSI Quality Assurance, which operates as one of the 'two
dozen' certification bodies.
The Association of British Certification Bodies was formed in 1992 and
complaints regarding assessment and certification activities should be
addressed to the secretary at 2 Park Street, London W1A 2BS.
