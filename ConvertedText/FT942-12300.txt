FT  30 APR 94 / Cusani gets eight yearsin jail for corruption: Sentence ends
months of intense media coverage

Italy's most gripping courtroom drama went off the air this week when a
Milan judge condemned Mr Sergio Cusani, a financial consultant to the
Ferruzzi-Montedison industrial group, to eight years in prison for
corruption and false accounting,
It was the first time a sentence had been transmitted live on Italian
television, ending six months of intense media coverage of the trial, which
featured guest appearances by stars of the discredited old political regime.
Mr Cusani helped conceal Montedison's illicit contributions to ruling
political parties, including the L150bn (Pounds 62m) 'mother of all bribes.
This sum smoothed the way for Ferruzzi-Montedison to pull out of Enimont,
its ill-fated joint venture with the state-owned Eni energy and chemicals
group, at a huge profit in 1990.
The judge ordered Mr Cusani to repay L167.8bn to Montedison, Ferruzzi's
principal industrial subsidiary company.
The sentence, handed down on Thursday night, amounts to a victory for the
prosecutor, Mr Antoni Di Pietro, Italy's best-known and most charismatic
investigating magistrate, who had asked for a seven-year sentence.
During the trial he began to uncover a network of political corruption more
widespread than most Italians had suspected.
The final day of the 400-hour trial did not disappoint armchair viewers. In
a desperate last stand, Mr Cusani accused the Milan magistrates of driving
Mr Raul Gardini, chairman of Ferruzzi, to suicide last year by not
responding to the tycoon's pleas to be questioned on the Enimont affair.
The crowded courtroom also had to be cleared before the sentence could be
delivered, after police officers discovered a small bomb.
