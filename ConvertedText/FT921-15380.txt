FT  10 JAN 92 / World Trade News: OECD export credit rates


THE Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development announced new
minimum interest rates for officially-supported export credits for Jan 15 -
Feb 2 1992 (Dec 15 - Jan 14 rates in brackets):
D-MARK 9.51 per cent (9.68);
FRENCH FRANC 10.31 (10.20);
GUILDER 9.75 (9.90);
ITALIAN LIRA 12.25 (12.06);
YEN 6.40 (6.70);
PESETA 12.87 (12.79);
STERLING 10.89 (10.85);
SWISS FRANC for credits of less than eight years 8.30 (same); for credits of
more than eight years 8.55 (same);
US DOLLAR for credits of up to five years 7.09 (7.52); for credits of over
five years 7.49 (7.92).
These rates are published monthly by the Financial Times, normally around
the middle of each month. They apply to all export credits. However, on
those to middle-income and poor developing countries the OECD matrix rate
can be used if lower.
This matrix was changed most recently on July 15 1990 and will be subject to
change on February 15.
