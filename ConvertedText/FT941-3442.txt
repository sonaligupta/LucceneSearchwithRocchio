FT  16 MAR 94 / Observer: Rapid progress


Whether or not Whitewater is more than an affair, it has clearly gripped the
imagination of London's stockbrokers. In less than a week various bits of
Warburgs, James Capel and UBS have sent out research with the same heading -
Whitewater Rafting.
Hey guys, let's show a bit more creativity. In an effort to raise the
standard of headline writing among City stockbrokers, Observer is offering a
bottle of the finest malt for the most original Whitewater headline on a
piece of published research.
