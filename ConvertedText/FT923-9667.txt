FT  04 AUG 92 / UK Company News: London Pacific boosts Govett profits to
Dollars 29.7m


   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor


GOVETT, the financial services group, recorded a 14 per cent increase in
interim pre-tax profits to Dollars 29.7m (Pounds 15.5m) for the six months
to June 30.
More than half the group's operating profits came from London Pacific, a US
insurance company which sells annuities through the intermediary market.
London Pacific's first half profits were 37.6 per cent higher at Dollars
14.5m.
In the UK, the group is best known for its investment management activities,
particularly its John Govett subsidiary.
Group funds under management increased from Dollars 5.2bn to Dollars 5.8bn,
with the bulk of the increase coming from client inflows, in particular US
mutual funds and specialised futures funds in the UK.
Investment management fees rose nearly 30 per cent to Dollars 18.1m, helped
by the acquisition of US fund manager ACI, now renamed Govett Institutional
Investment.
However, the acquisition and the growth of the mutual funds business led to
a 45 per cent increase in operating expenses to Dollars 15.9m. Investment
income fell to Dollars 4.8m (Dollars 5.23m) in the wake of lower US interest
rates.
Operating profits were Dollars 27.6m (Dollars 23.4m) and after net profits
on investments of Dollars 2.07m (Dollars 2.53m), pre-tax profits were
Dollars 29.7m (Dollars 26m). After tax of Dollars 7.06m (Dollars 5.35m),
fully diluted earnings per share were 28.5 cents (25.5 cents).
The company is paying a gross dividend of 9.5 cents (8.5 cents).
The shares rose 4p to 107p on the news yesterday, having touched a peak of
333p before the crash of 1987. Mr Ian Whitehead, chief financial officer,
said the group hoped to widen its shareholder base by an American Depositary
Receipt scheme in the US.
Mr Arthur Trueger, the executive chairman, said 'the outlook for the balance
of the year is encouraging. While always vulnerable to unexpected
developments, our business is very diversified and growing in all areas.'
