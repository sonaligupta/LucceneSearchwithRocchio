FT  22 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading


   By JOEL KIBAZO


A firm opening on Wall Street, together with a squeeze in the second half of
the session, helped stock index futures reverse an earlier slide, writes
Joel Kibazo.
After opening at 3,078, the first part of the day was marked by a slide in
the September Footsie contract, with traders disappointed by the
Bundesbank's decision to leave interest rates unchanged. It fell to a low of
3,066.
But improving bonds, a stronger dollar and the good start to trading in the
US came to the rescue of September in early afternoon trading. James Capel
was reported to have been a good buyer, as was UBS. That strong demand
brought about a squeeze in the last hour of trading which saw September
advance to the day's peak of 3,120.
Profit-taking in the closing minutes saw the contract finish at 3,114, up 38
from its previous close and around 12 points above its fair value premium to
cash of around 6 points. Volume was 13,314 lots.
Turnover in traded options improved to 34,612 contracts from Wednesday's
27,216. Among the index options, the FT-SE 100 option saw 8,193 lots
transacted and the Euro FT-SE 3,122.
Hanson was the busiest stock option with 5,059 lots dealt. It was followed
by Lasmo at 3,852 and Shell at 2,571. Ladbroke and British Gas were also
busy.
