FT  22 APR 91 / US Money and Credit: Traders confused by mixed signals


   By NIKKI TAIT


THE STORY in the US bond markets last week was all about what did not
happen.
Ten days ago, traders were confronting two sets of relatively benign
inflation data, in turn preceded by some grim employment figures. Not
surprisingly, they concluded that there was good reason to stimulate the
economy further, and sufficient scope for a further easing of US interest
rates to take place.
A couple of hours into Monday morning, this conviction was disappearing
rapidly. The Federal Reserve moved into the open market for Treasury
securities earlier than usual, draining reserves from the banking system.
That was immediately interpreted as a signal that any speculation about a
further rate reduction was off the mark.
Accordingly, bond prices fell back, and the yield on the 'benchmark' long
bond descended to 8.24 per cent, compared with 8.12 per cent at the end of
the previous week.
Newspaper stories - in the Washington Post, in particular - suggested that
the Fed had decided against any further action before its next
policy-setting Open Market Committee meeting in mid-May.
Coming on top of the recent speculation about policy divisions within the
Federal Reserve Board, dealers concluded that there might be more than a
grain of truth in the rumours. So by the end of the week, and after some
sharp price falls on Thursday and Friday, the yield on the 30-year Treasury
bond had widened to 8.25 per cent.
Signals from the corporate sector are, at best, mixed. The current reporting
season, for example, only covers the first three months of the year, when
Gulf-related factors were confusing the commercial environment. Although
numerous executives have said that they view the months ahead with
confidence, firm evidence to back this up is flimsy.
April, moreover, will be the first month this year to reflect the 'post-Gulf
environment', and data for this period will only arrive in early May.
So it is scarcely surprising that views on the rate at which the economy may
recover - and the future scenario for interest rates - should vary. Wall
Street brokers, Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, for example, suggest that 'the
recession is either over or is just about to end'.
They go on to argue that 'there is little reason to believe that the Fed
will ease monetary policy further - in fact, at this point in time, any
easing of monetary policy would probably be a mistake by the monetary
policy.'
Britain's James Capel, by contrast, is less emphatic. 'The chances of
another Fed ease are certainly not zero if inflation continues to fall and
the recovery proves to be elusive or slow, but it will clearly take at least
another month . . . for further clarification,' its analysts say.
But if developments on the interest rate front proved a vain hope, there is
still activity in the corporate bond segment.
According to one estimate, around Dollars 6.5bn-worth of new non-convertible
issues were brought to the market last week, compared with little more than
Dollars 3bn-worth a fortnight ago. There was even some talk of a revival in
'junk bond' issues, as a chunky offering from RJR Nabisco, the tobacco and
food combine that was taken private through a Dollars 25bn leveraged
buy-out, pulled in investors.
The RJR deal was certainly not modest. The size of the issue of senior notes
was doubled from the initial plan - Dollars 1.5bn-worth against Dollars 750m
 -and carried a 10.5 per cent interest rate.
The scale of the offering, moreover, looked all the more impressive when
placed against the total value of junk bond offerings in 1990 - just Dollars
1.3bn. And it was, perhaps, just bad luck that the stock's trading debut
should coincide with Friday's tumble in bond prices. By the close, the new
bonds were down  1/2 at 99 1/2 .
However, it would be dangerous to conclude that RJR's success heralds the
rebirth of junk bond finance.
For a start, there is a barrier on the investment side. In the past, two of
the main sources of demand for such stocks have been thrifts and insurance
companies, and both have had their wings seriously clipped.
The RJR yield, moreover, was scarcely typical of the 'junkier' end of the
non-investment grade market.
In short, a little extra risk for a little extra return may sell. Beyond
that, it is probably unwise to go.
