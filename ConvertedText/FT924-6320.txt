FT  21 NOV 92 / Directors' Share Transactions


   By ANGUS MACDONALD, Directus Ltd


DEALING by directors remains at a relatively low ebb, but we are starting to
see a pick-up in option-related activity which indicates that normal trading
conditions are about to be restored.
Marks and Spencer is very much the giant in the stores sector. The recent
interim results further enhanced its reputation but Simon Sacher has sold
50,000 shares at 326p, still near their 1992 high of 348p.
The sales in Betterware should be taken in context with purchases made by
other directors at the same time. Managing director Andrew Cohen disposed of
372,500 shares but Robert Thornton acquired 937,500. Since Cohen continues
to hold almost 60m jointly, this sale is relatively insignificant.
Betterware has proved one of the success stories of the '90s so far, and
recent interim results were again much better than analysts' expectation.
Louis Goodman, managing director of City Site Estates has proved a keen
supporter of his own shares. The latest purchases were made at 12p, since
when the shares have bounced quite sharply.
