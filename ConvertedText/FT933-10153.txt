FT  05 AUG 93 / International Company News in Brief: Ciments Francais


   By REUTER


   PARIS


CIMENTS Francais, the French cement group, said first-half 1993 revenues
fell 13 per cent, to FFr6.59bn (Dollars 1.1bn) compared with the first half
of 1992, Reuter reports from Paris.
It said the decline was due in part to falls in certain currency rates
against the franc, and the overall economic slowdown in France. Foreign
exchange fluctuations accounted for a FFr119m drop in revenues.
On a comparable and constant exchange-rate basis, revenues would have fallen
7.4 per cent. The company expects the decline in revenues for the second
half to be less than the first.
The biggest declines in revenue were in France and Belgium, at FFr3.97bn,
down 10 per cent.
