FT  22 OCT 92 / International Company News: Enso-Gutzeit cuts loss after
rationalisation

ENSO-GUTZEIT, the Finnish pulp and paper group, cut losses to FM283m
(Dollars 59m) in the first eight months from FM384m a year earlier.
Its performance benefited from rationalisation, but the pace of its recovery
slowed in the second four months because of continuing over-capacity and the
weak dollar. Sales rose 4.7 per cent to FM6.38bn, with the biggest increases
recorded for pulp and paperboard, sawn goods and laminating papers.
The operating margin was FM917m, or 14.4 per cent of sales, against FM740m,
or 12.2 per cent, a year ago. Exchange losses on foreign loans were reduced
to FM126m from FM289m. The loss per share was FM2.33, against FM3.10.
The group declined to give a forecast for the full year because of exchange
rate uncertainty, but said losses would be lower than the FM950m last year.
Finland's decision in September to float the markka will raise financial
expenses by FM400m, but cash flow will improve.
Celsius, the Swedish state-owned industrial-military group, made a profit
(after financial items) of SKr345m (Dollars 61m) for the first eight months
compared with a profit of SKr427m in the previous corresponding term, writes
Robert Taylor in Stockholm.
Net sales increased to SKr7.7bn from SKr5.6bn, and the order books totalled
SKr22bn at the end of August.
The profit for the whole of 1992 is expected to be similar to last year's
total of SKr507m.
