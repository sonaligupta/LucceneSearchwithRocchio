FT  20 JUL 94 / People: Manley's own award


Harry Manley has been trying to retire for some time. But after more than 30
years in the television and film business he has not managed to achieve it.
For 30 years he worked at Colour Film Services; he started there as company
secretary when it was really a film laboratory. By the time he retired, he
was managing director of a much broader company involved in everything from
video to the latest computer technology.
For more than 13 years, Manley, 59, served on the board of management of The
British Academy of Film and Television Arts and became finance director for
three years after his retirement; he is an accountant by training. He
retired to concentrate on entertainment industry charities; he is treasurer
of the Children's Film Unit.
But now he has embarked on a second career. Having been enticed back to
Bafta this year to run the organisation's famous awards ceremony - the
British equivalent of the Oscars - following the resignation last year of
Bafta director Tony Byrne, Manley has now been appointed chief executive.
' I haven't got a contract. All the people on the board are my friends. I
will stay as long as they want me,' he says.
The film and television organisation has been facing financial problems
mainly because a new lease was signed virtually on the day the recession
arrived and conference business began to dry up. 'We are very bullish about
the future. We have survived and things are beginning to look up,' he says.
