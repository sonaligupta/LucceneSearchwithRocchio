FT  30 JAN 92 / The Bush Budget: White House approach signals break with
Republican past - Budget analysis


   By MICHAEL PROWSE


   WASHINGTON


THE BUDGET represents a significant retreat for President George Bush from
past Republican policies.
For the first time in years, the administration is not projecting budget
balance in the medium term. Meanwhile, the welter of tax cuts proposed to
combat recession in the short run contradict the spirit of the Reagan tax
reform act of 1986, which tried to reduce distortions and create a level
fiscal playing field.
The administration expects economic growth to resume this spring and
accelerate through the year.
The main forces spurring recovery are lower interest rates and the budget's
mild fiscal stimulus. The projections show gross domestic product growing by
2.2 per cent between the fourth quarters of last year and this year and then
averaging about 3 per cent until 1997.
Consumer price inflation is expected to stabilise at just over 3 per cent.
Unemployment is forecast to decline slowly, from 6.8 per cent this year to
5.3 per cent in 1997.
The short-term projections are roughly in line with private sector
forecasts. The longer-term projection of 3 per cent growth, however, is
relatively optimistic. The Congressional Budget Office, an independent
adviser to Congress, recently forecast growth of about 2.6 per cent a year
after the immediate recovery from recession.
The administration attributes the difference to the president's growth
package which it says will raise the real growth rate by 0.4 percentage
points per year.
Most of the tax measures are expected to be inexpensive. Excluding the
change in withholding rules, the total impact is to reduce receipts by about
Dollars 5.2bn (Pounds 2.87bn) this year.
The biggest revenue loser is the temporary investment tax allowance for
companies, which will cost Dollars 6.1bn. The capital gains tax cut is
forecast to raise Dollars 600m this year, rising to Dollars 3.8bn next year.
Over time the most costly proposal - the planned increase in the personal
tax exemption for children - does not take effect until fiscal 1993, when it
is projected to cost Dollars 4.4bn.
The budget nevertheless reveals a substantial deterioration in the outlook
for the federal deficit, both in the short and long run. This year's deficit
is expected to reach a record Dollars 400bn, compared with a projection of
Dollars 281bn this time last year and recent estimates of about Dollars
350bn.
More serious, the administration has abandoned hope of achieving budget
balance in the medium term.
The deficit is not expected to fall significantly below Dollars 200bn (about
3 per cent of GDP) in the next five years. This time last year, Mr Richard
Darman, the budget director, projected a modest surplus by 1996.
Mr Darman, however, says this budget is prudent. The administration has not,
as many feared, abandoned the discipline of the 1990 budget enforcement act.
The president has not raised the caps on discretionary spending programmes,
nor transferred spending between different sections of the budget - for
example between defence and domestic programmes.
He points out, however, that as a matter of arithmetic the proposed defence
savings of about Dollars 50bn up to 1997 are roughly sufficient to offset
the cost of the proposed Dollars 500 per child increase in the personal tax
exemption, which is the most costly of the president's permanent tax
changes.
The administration is willing to amend the budget enforcement act to allow
defence cuts to be used as an offset if Congress objects to other cuts
needed to finance the child tax exemption.
Mr Darman claims that the president's policy proposals, by stimulating
faster growth, will more than pay for themselves. Relative to business as
usual, they would reduce the deficit by a total of Dollars 66bn by 1997. Why
then has the deficit outlook deteriorated?
In the short term, the recession is to blame. Over the longer run, Mr Darman
singles out the explosive growth of spending on mandatory or 'entitlement'
programmes. Total mandatory spending is projected at Dollars 767bn next
fiscal year, more than half the total federal budget.
The biggest programmes are pensions and health care for the elderly and
poor. Mandatory spending is expected to rise at an annual rate of 7.2 per
cent over the next five years.
Mr Darman says that if growth of mandatory programmes were restricted to
compensate only for inflation and population growth, cumulative budgetary
savings of nearly Dollars 390bn over the next five years would be possible.
He therefore proposes to remedy a 'fundamental flaw in the present system of
budget discipline' by introducing a specific cap on growth of mandatory
programmes akin to the caps on discretionary programmes agreed in 1990.
Under his proposed cap, mandatory spending would be permitted to grow 2.5
percentage points a year faster than population plus consumer price
inflation. If comprehensive health care reforms were introduced, this
ceiling would be reduced to 1.6 percentage points in excess of population
growth and inflation.
The administration says tougher controls of mandatory spending are
'inescapable' if deficits are to be controlled in the future. It remains to
be seen, however, whether curbs on highly popular entitlement programmes
will prove politically possible. In an election year, the answer is almost
certainly 'no'.
