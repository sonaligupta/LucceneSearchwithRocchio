FT  20 NOV 92 / Observer: Ah so


The Japanese have a new word for the state of their economy: sokobai. But
one place where you won't hear it spoken is Nippon Syntex's immunological
research centre north of Tokyo - staff there must use the translation
'crawling along the bottom'.
The reason is that the pharmaceuticals group has banned the use of Japanese
at the centre, making English its official language instead. 'We're visited
by researchers from all over the world,' explains a spokesman, 'and we want
them to feel at home.'
