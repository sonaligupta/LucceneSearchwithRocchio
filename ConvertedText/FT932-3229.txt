FT  15 JUN 93 / International Company News: Bischoff resigns as Sandoz
finance chief


   By IAN RODGER and REUTER


   ZUG


MR VICTOR Bischoff, chief financial officer of Sandoz, has left the Swiss
pharmaceutical and chemicals group 'by mutual agreement'.
Mr Bischoff, who led the formerly secretive group's moves towards greater
transparency and involvement in international capital markets, is the third
senior executive to leave in recent months.
Mr Max Link, formerly head of Sandoz' pharmaceutical division, has left to
head another drug company, and his successor, Mr Rolf Soiron, has also moved
on.
Their departures come at a time when the group appears to be preparing for
the succession to Mr Marc Moret, the autocratic 69-year old chairman.
Mr Moret announced in March that he would step down as president of the
executive board, but would carry on as chairman and chief executive officer.
Mr Daniel Wagniere, head of the group's US subsidiary, is to succeed him.
'This would appear to be further shake-out from the recent top-level
changes,' said Mr Peter Smith, pharmaceuticals analyst at brokers James
Capel in London.
Sandoz declined to give any reason for Mr Bischoff's departure.
He joined the group in 1987 and became a member of the executive board in
1990.
Landis & Gyr, the Swiss electro-mechanical engineering group, yesterday said
that Mars Electronics International, a unit of Mars Inc, had acquired the
assets, trade marks and technology of its Sodeco Cash Management Systems
unit, Reuter reports from Zug.
Landis & Gyr said its Sodeco unit employed around 80 people, and had annual
sales of SFr30m (Dollars 20.7m).
A company spokesman was not immediately available to comment on financial
details of the transaction.
