FT  22 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Boots rises 4% in first quarter


   By NEIL BUCKLEY


Boots, the chemist, retailing and pharmaceuticals group, confirmed the
picture of moderate recovery in retail sales with news that its sales were
up 4.4 per cent in the first quarter of its financial year.
Some analysts were disappointed by the figures - particularly a 5.3 per cent
fall in total sales at Do It All, the DIY joint venture with WH Smith - and
the shares ended 13 1/2 p down at 522p.
The size of the fall, however, was said to be largely due to a programme
sale of retail stocks by an institutional investor.
Sir Christopher Benson, at his last annual meeting as chairman before
handing over to Sir Michael Angus, said sales were satisfactory in a
'difficult if improving environment'.
Total sales at Boots the Chemists were up 4.2 per cent, with like-for-like
sales, which exclude new store openings, up 2.8 per cent.
High-margin health and beauty and personal care products were up 8 per cent,
and although sales of toiletries had been affected by poor weather in June,
they recovered in July.
Among the other retailing businesses, Boots Opticians lifted sales 8.9 per
cent, Halfords 7.6 per cent, and Childrens World 19.4 per cent.
However, sales at AG Stanley, which operates the Fads home decorating
stores, were down 0.4 per cent, and Do It All was down 5.3 per cent in a DIY
market described as 'dull'.
On the pharmaceuticals side, the prescription drugs business increased sales
6.4 per cent, helped by a strong performance from Synthroid, the thyroid
treatment, in the US.
Boots Healthcare International, the over-the-counter drugs business, also
improved sales by 6.4 per cent.
However, sales at Boots Contract Manufacturing fell 3.6 per cent, largely
due to the withdrawal of the Manoplax heart drug which it was manufacturing
last year.
