FT  28 JUL 92 / People: Goldring ventures into consultancy


It's rare to find an optimistic fund manager these days but 42-year-old
Howard Goldring seems to fit the bill. He has chucked in his job as director
of global strategy at Allied Dunbar Asset Management and set up his own
consultancy, Alberon Associates.
'I felt the recovery was coming and wanted to be in place when it came,'
says Goldring, who has been a fund manager for 12 years. He will continue to
work as a consultant for Allied Dunbar and write a monthly newsletter on
global investment strategy. But he is keen to get more heavily involved in
business - he was a non-executive director of Ernest Jones before it was
taken over by Ratners - and work on some venture capital projects.
He has been appointed a non-executive director of Michael Heller's London &
Associated Investment Trust. Despite its name, London & Associated is not an
investment trust but a property company specialising in investing in
shopping centres and parades.
It is one of three public companies, chaired by the 56-year-old Heller who
made his first fortune when he sold the family's KP Foods business to United
Biscuits. His other vehicles are Bisichi Mining, a speculative mining stock,
and Electronic Data Processing, a highly-rated computer software company.
Goldring, who says that he has known Heller for some years, owns 300,000
shares in London & Associated, which gives him the biggest shareholding of
any director save the chairman. The Heller family owns 40.4m shares, or 58.5
per cent of the equity.
Allied Dunbar, which manages Pounds 9bn of funds, says that Malcolm Baker,
who looks after European investments, will assume Goldring's
responsibilities.
