FT  22 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Rebel Barrs to oppose plans to enfranchise
non-voting shares


   By RICHARD WOLFFE


Mr Nicholas and Mr Robert Barr, the brothers who are attempting to unseat
their uncle, Mr Malcolm Barr, as chairman of Barr & Wallace Arnold Trust,
yesterday pledged to vote down the board's plans to enfranchise non-voting
shares.
The brothers, who speak for 30 per cent of the voting shares, sent a letter
to Hambros, the leisure and motor distribution group's financial advisers,
stating their opposition to the board's resolution. The board needs a 75 per
cent majority to succeed.
They also repeated their demands for the removal of Mr Malcolm Barr along
with his chief executive, Mr John Parker, and his finance director, Mr Brian
Small. A second meeting will vote on Mr Parker and Mr Small before December.
'This did not start out as a family feud,' said Mr Nicholas Barr. 'We tried
to the best of our ability to persuade Malcolm Barr to take a graceful and
dignified exit from his position on the board. He chose to have no interest
in any of those proposals.'
The board yesterday declared its intention to continue with its EGM, and is
expected to issue a document next week, which is thought to include an
audited profit forecast, as well as details of the 1-for-1 scrip issue to
compensate ordinary shareholders for the loss of voting control.
Ironically, enfranchisement is one of the rebels' principal proposals for
modernising the company. The group's 10m non-voting shares are mainly owned
by institutions.
Nicholas and Robert are the sons of Mr Stuart Barr, the managing director
who died two years ago.
