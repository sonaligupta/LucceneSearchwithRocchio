FT  27 MAY 93 / AT&T challenges Europe and steals a march on BT: Worldsource
launch targets multinationals' needs


   By ANDREW ADONIS and MARTIN DICKSON


THE RACE is on to become 'global outsourcer' for the telecommunications
needs of the world's multinationals, write Andrew Adonis and Martin Dickson.
American Telephone & Telegraph's launch this week of 'Worldsource', a set of
customised international business telecoms services, marks a determined bid
for this pitch by the largest US carrier. British Telecom, the privatised UK
operator, has similar ambitions, and as liberalisation forces the other
large European telecoms carriers to look outwards, they too could enter the
field.
The goal is simple: to become the 'one-stop shop' for the 2,500-odd large
companies with globally dispersed operations - managing and integrating
their international networks, offering them the latest in data and voice
facilities, and providing a single point of contact however dispersed the
company's outlets.
Worldsource aims to do virtually that by creating a web of partnerships with
other operators. This week it announced a link-up with Kokusai Denshin Denwa
of Japan and Singapore Telecom, and indicated that Unitel of Canada, Telstra
of Australia and Korea Telecom intend to join soon. It plans to take
Worldsource into Europe next year.
With analysts predicting that turnover in international telecoms traffic
will more than double by the year 2000, the financial stakes are immense. It
is significant that AT&T launched Worldsource in the Asia-Pacific: the
region has the world's fastest growing telecoms sector.
Essentially, Worldsource enhances the existing Global Software Defined
Network service, by adding features like single billing, full integration of
international data and voice networks, and improved dialling, circuit
availability and network management standards. Says one City telecoms
analyst: 'It's innovative - but international telecoms is increasingly a
commodity business based on price, and of itself Worldsource does little to
make it cheaper.'
Extending the service to Europe is critical to Worldsource. AT&T is
budgeting to spend Dollars 350m (Pounds 230m) over the next five years
providing facilities and upgrading equipment in Europe. Mr John Foster,
director of AT&T's communications services in Europe, said he was keen to
talk to 'almost any' of Europe's telecoms operators about a link-up.
Since Worldsource does not give AT&T exclusive rights over its partners,
most of Europe's state telecoms operators appear to have little to lose from
participation. Unless, that is, they want to be global outsourcers
themselves, and are anxious to give no succour to AT&T.
BT, however, has already signalled its determination to go-it-alone. Nearly
two years ago BT launched its global outsourcing venture Syncordia, which
now boasts nine customers and an annual revenue of about Dollars 200m
(Pounds 130m). Furthermore BT and AT&T are currently locked in a battle with
US and UK regulatory authorities over access to each other's public fixed
network.
So AT&T could have difficulties in the UK. But it is not restricted to BT:
Mercury is a potential partner, while newly-licensed public telecom
operators Ionica National Grid's Energis are building their own networks.
As for BT, Worldsource could encourage the UK operator to link up with MCI.
There have been rumours for months that this might happen, but the drawback
from BT's point of view is that it would put itself squarely in AT&T's
sights, since MCI is AT&T's most important rival in the US.
AT&T, moreover, has shown itself ruthless in hitting back at global
competition from MCI. MCI's only big alliance so far, announced last year,
was with Stentor, a Canadian long-distance consortium, under which MCI
technology is being used to create a fully integrated international network
between Canada and the US. AT&T immediately retaliated by taking a minority
stake in Unitel, Stentor's upstart Canadian rival, and sued MCI for patent
infringement.
Just how strong demand will be for Worldsource is not clear. At the launch,
AT&T put together an impressive group of companies who said they needed the
service. If the likes of Unisys, Honeywell, Motorola and United Parcel
Service meant it, the world could truly be AT&T's oyster.
