FT  01 DEC 94 / World Trade News: US to sell helicopters to Egypt


   By REUTER


   WASHINGTON


The US plans to sell 12 Apache attack helicopters made by McDonnell Douglas
Corporation to Egypt for Dollars 318m, the Defence Department said
yesterday. The package would include four spare Hellfire missile launchers,
six spare engines and night vision and targeting systems, the Pentagon said
in a statement informing Congress that Egypt was seeking the Apaches. Egypt
had already bought 24 of the Apaches and the additional sale would not upset
the military balance in the Middle East, the announcement said. The proposed
sale is expected to be completed without opposition from Congress.
