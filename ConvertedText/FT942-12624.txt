FT  28 APR 94 / International Company News: Lion Nathan posts 42% increase

Lion Nathan, the New Zealand brewing group, yesterday reported a 42.2 per
cent rise in tax-paid profits to NZDollars 113m (USDollars 65m) for the six
months to February 28, helped by an improving contribution from its
Australian interests.
Mr Douglas Myers, chief executive officer, said profits from the Australian
subsidiaries received a setback during September and October, during
industrial trouble that cut production. He said market share had recovered
in the last quarter, although continued problems were being encountered by
the fall in the overall Australian beer market.
In New Zealand the company had increased its market share of the beer market
to 59.3 per cent, against the Singapore Breweries-Heineken joint venture
which recently gained control of DB Group, Lion Nathan's leading competitor.
Mr Myers said the company was confident profits would exceed NZDollars 200m
in the full year before any abnormal items.
The interim dividend from retained earnings is being lifted by 1 cent to 7.5
cents a share.
Earnings per share were 20.6 cents, against 17.3 cents.
