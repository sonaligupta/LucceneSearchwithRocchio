FT  16 JAN 92 / International Company News: Intel's strong results beat
analysts' predictions

   SAN FRANCISCO


INTEL, the leading maker of computer microprocessor chips, reported strong
fourth-quarter results, bringing revenues and earnings for the year to
record levels and well above analysts' projections.
Dr Andrew Grove, president and chief executive, said: '1991 was an
outstanding year for Intel.' Revenues for the year rose by 22 per cent to
Dollars 4.78bn, up from Dollars 3.92bn in 1990.
Net income was Dollars 819m, or Dollars 3.92 a share, compared with Dollars
650m, or Dollars 3.20.
Fourth-quarter results were strong, with revenue of Dollars 1.21bn, up 15
per cent from Dollars 1.05bn for the same period in 1990. Net income of
Dollars 189m, or 90 cents a share, increased from Dollars 164m, or 80 cents,
for the fourth quarter of 1990. Wall Street analysts had forecast
fourth-quarter earnings of about 84 cents a share.
Intel's success, despite a broad decline in the semiconductor market, stems
from the popularity of its latest microprocessor products. Its 486 and 386
microprocessors form the 'brains' of most personal computers.
'In 1992, these chips will be the centre of our product line. We will expand
their production and offer several new products in these families,' said Dr
Grove.
Although Intel is facing increasing competition in the microprocessor
market, particularly from Advanced Micro Devices which last year launched
its own version of the 386, Dr Grove declared his determination to maintain
Intel's dominant market position.
