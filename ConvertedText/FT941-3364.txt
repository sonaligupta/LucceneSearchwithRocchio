FT  16 MAR 94 / International Company News: Nike net slides as sports shoes
lose appeal


   By FRANK MCGURTY


   NEW YORK


Nike, the US athletic footwear and apparel marketer, yesterday posted a
sharp downturn in revenues and earnings for its third fiscal quarter.
The poor performance reflected lagging US sales of its mainstay line of
basketball shoes, which have fallen out of fashion with young people over
the past year.
Net income in the three months to the end of February amounted to Dollars
63.2m, or 85 cents a share, well below last year's Dollars 89.4m, or Dollars
1.16.
Revenues dropped 10 per cent to Dollars 871.8m, against Dollars 972m last
time. In the US, sales were down 14 per cent at Dollars 562m. International
revenues dipped 2 per cent to Dollars 260m, but would have shown a 4 per
cent improvement if the effect of currency fluctuations were excluded.
