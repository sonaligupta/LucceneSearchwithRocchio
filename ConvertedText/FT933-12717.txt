FT  22 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading


   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY


CAUTION again ruled the day in stock index futures as dealers refused to be
moved by good retail sales figures, Christine Buckley writes.
Institutional players were notable by their absence and there were few
buyers of the September FT-SE 100 contract, although sellers pushed up the
day's volume to quite a strong showing at 11,526 contracts.
The September contract started trading at 2,832, some 8 points up from its
previous finish, and its high of the session - only one point ahead at 2,833
 -was quickly reached. Thereafter it was downhill all the way.
The retail sales figures failed to pep up sentiment as bearish market
stories on the retail sector and fears over brand names took their toll.
Weak performances on the French and German markets added to the gloom, as
did fading hopes of German interest rate cuts.
As the opening of Wall Street approached, the contract sunk to the day's low
of 2,802. An afternoon rally pushed it up to a close of 2,818, about a point
ahead of its fair value premium to cash.
A low profile was similarly the order of the day in traded options, which
mustered a volume of 24,010 contracts.
The highest of the stock options was Lasmo, which traded 2,245 lots,
although 2,000 of these were down to one broker buying 1,000 of the August
puts and selling 1,000 November puts.
