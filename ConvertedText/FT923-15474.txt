FT  02 JUL 92 / People: Insurance moves


John Wybrew is to take up the posts of chairman and managing director at
Windsor Life, rejoining the company after a two-year hiatus at British
American Assurance Company in Singapore. Wybrew, who joined Windsor in 1965,
replaces Brian Wood who resigned in April after insurance regulators
temporarily suspended the company's entire sales force, insisting that
proper training and testing procedures be put in place.
Windsor Life is wholly owned by the US's fourth largest insurance company,
New York Life, which has been running the company since Brian Wood's
departure. Wybrew was instrumental in Windsor Life's rapid expansion during
the 1980s - an expansion which presumably led to its acquisition by New York
Life in the first place.

The shakeout among the higher echelons of Britain's troubled construction
companies continues with the news that Jack Mawdsley, chief executive of
Tarmac's large quarry products division is to quit the group at the end of
this year.
The company's statement says Mawdsley, who is 53, is leaving to 'pursue
personal interests' which had been 'sadly neglected' during his 22 years at
the Midlands-based construction and building materials group.
One of the reasons behind Mawdsley's departure, however, may have been
disagreements over policy decisions taken by Sir Eric Pountain who gave up
day-to-day running of the company in February when he stood down as Tarmac's
chief executive. Sir Eric remains chairman.
In particular, Mawdsley opposed the continued high level of investment made
in housebuilding while other divisions including his own have had their
spending curtailed. He is understood to have been frustrated by Sir Eric's
reluctance to expand the quarry products division in continental Europe.
His decision to retire at the end of this year is understood to have been
taken before Sir Eric announced that he was standing down as chief executive
in favour of Neville Simms.
