FT  15 NOV 93 / People: Shell's md of UK exploration


Heinz Rothermund (right) is to take over as managing director of Shell UK
Exploration and Production on January 1. He replaces Chris Fay, who has
moved up to chairman and chief executive.
Rothermund, a Swiss citizen and an engineering graduate of the Swiss Federal
Institute of Technology, first came to the UK in 1976, serving a stint as
offshore installation manager on the Brent 'B' platform. He later assumed a
senior offshore design post and became project manager for the Tern field,
before moving on in 1982 to Shell's operations in Nigeria.
Those were the 'glory days' of the North Sea, he said yesterday from his
office in Hanover, where he is chief executive of BEB Erdgas und Erdoel, an
oil and gas joint venture between Shell and Esso.
Recent developments in the German gas market 'are not comparable' to events
taking place in the UK, he concedes, but the future of the British gas
industry will figure heavily in his new job overseeing the UK largest
offshore operator, accounting for about a third of national oil and gas
production. 'I will be extremely curious to see how the UK gas market
develops.'
Rothermund does not expect to face radically different challenges in
exploration and development. But he admits that the task of finding and
developing oil in the deep water to the west of Shetland will press offshore
technology to its limits.
Rothermund hopes he will find some changes in social circumstances. When he
last lived in the country 'I was always finding myself defending Britain at
parties' against a wave of disparaging remarks from the British themselves.
'In those days I was very surprised to see them run down their country so
much. It has so much to offer.'
