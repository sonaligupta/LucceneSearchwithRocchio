FT  27 SEP 94 / Disposals at Kodak near end


   By TONY JACKSON


   NEW YORK


The sale of L&F Household to Reckitt & Colman brings Eastman Kodak almost to
the end of the ambitious disposal programme announced in May by Mr George
Fisher, its new chairman. The deal also brings total cash raised by the
programme to Dollars 7.2bn (Pounds 4.6bn), leaving Kodak apparently
debt-free.
More important in strategic terms, it virtually completes Kodak's strategy
of returning to its basic business. This the company defines as 'imaging' -
not only traditional photographic activities but the high-tech world of
multi-media, with which Mr Fisher is familiar from his previous job as boss
of the electronics firm Motorola.
The one substantial disposal remaining is the rest of L&F, consisting of DIY
products such as wood finishers. Kodak is coy about the size of this
business or how much it might fetch. However, a clue can be derived from the
fact that when it decided to sell L&F in two parts - on the grounds that it
could not reach its target price for the business as a whole - that price
was rumoured to be about Dollars 2bn.
Also to be sold are a small technology subsidiary, NanoSystems, and the
research and development headquarters of Sterling, the drug company which
Kodak sold to Sanofi of France earlier this year. Sanofi has agreed to lease
the building from Kodak for a year.
When Mr Fisher arrived at Kodak last December, some observers were sceptical
about his ability to turn around a company which seemed to have lost its
way. However, the speed at which he has moved has won Wall Street's
admiration.
