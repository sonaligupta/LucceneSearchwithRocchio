FT  08 NOV 93 / Railway safety scheme faces axe


   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent


AN ADVANCED rail safety programme proposed after the Clapham train crash in
south London five years ago could be axed because, at a cost of Pounds 600m
to Pounds 700m, it is too expensive.
British Rail said yesterday that it was continuing its evaluation of
Automatic Train Protection, a computerised system which takes over if a
driver takes a wrong decision.
But it acknowledged that development of the programme had been delayed by a
cash shortage, and that 'very significant funding' would be needed before it
could be brought into use.
There are concerns that ATP is too expensive in relation to the safety
improvement it would bring.
Railtrack, the organisation that is due to take over responsibility for
track and signalling, said it would be guided by an evaluation being carried
out by BR. Railtrack is to start operating next April as part of rail
privatisation.
The proposal for ATP was made in a report by Sir Anthony Hidden QC into the
Clapham train crash, which killed 35 people in December 1988. The report
recommended that the system should be introduced on BR's trunk routes within
five years of it having reached a satisfactory stage of development.
BR has been testing ATP equipment supplied by German and Belgian companies
during the past 18 months. It is used on two routes, between London and
Bristol and between London and Aylesbury, to check its performance on both
InterCity and local networks. The system is not in general use on any
international rail system though it has been applied locally around the
world, BR said.
A problem with introducing ATP is that it has to be adapted to very
different types of train, some heavy and travelling fast and others lighter
and running more slowly.
