FT  27 OCT 92 / First Maxwell civil action


THE FIRST civil litigation over the Maxwell affair began yesterday when US
publishers Macmillan Inc began a 12-week High Court action to recover its 56
per cent controlling interest in Berlitz International Inc.
Macmillan is seeking the return of 5.8m Berlitz shares worth more than
Dollars 100m from Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings, Swiss Volksbank and
Credit Suisse.
Lord Irvine QC, for Macmillan, said the three financial institutions claimed
the shares were pledges to them to secure lendings to private companies
owned by the late Robert Maxwell.
