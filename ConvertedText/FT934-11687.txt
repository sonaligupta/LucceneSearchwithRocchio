FT  29 OCT 93 / International Company News: Mediobanca


   By ROBERT GRAHAM


   ROME


SHAREHOLDERS in Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank, yesterday approved a
L1,020bn (Dollars 625m) capital increase to provide for the forthcoming wave
of privatisations in Italy and to cover portfolio write-downs as a result of
recession and the Ferruzzi-Montedison collapse, writes Robert Graham in
Rome.
There had been speculation that the three banks controlled by Iri, the state
holding company - Credito Italiano, Banca Commerciale Italiano (BCI) and
Banca di Roma - would use their combined 25 per cent stake to delay the
move.
