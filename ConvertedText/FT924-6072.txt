MALAYSIA Airlines (MAS) has announced a reorganisation of its operating
structure, writes Kieren Cooke in Kuala Lumpur.
The national carrier's domestic and international operations are to be
separated in various key areas, in particular in marketing and sales. A
considerable staff reorganisation is also underway.
MAS says the new structure will help it meet 'current and future
challenges.' MAS has also given details of its 5.5 per cent increase in
pre-tax profits to MDollars 153.46m (USDollars 61.2m) for the six months to
end-September.
Included in the profit figure was MDollars 139.5m gained from the sale of
two B737-200 and two DC10-30 aircraft.
