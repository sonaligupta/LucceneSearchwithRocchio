FT  25 MAY 93 / International Company News: Profits warning lowers Kellogg's
share price 5%

A WARNING on second-quarter earnings sent Kellogg's share price sharply
lower yesterday.
The US cereals group expects earnings per share in the quarter to be about
10 per cent lower than the 68 cents in the same period last year.
It sees record earnings per share for the full year but achieving
double-digit growth over last year's Dollars 2.75 a share 'will be
challenging', it added.
By the close the shares were down Dollars 2 3/4 , or almost 5 per cent, at
Dollars 53 7/8 on Wall Street.
Mr Arnold Langbo, chairman and chief executive officer, said they were being
hit in the short term by 'slower-than-expected recoveries from recession in
key markets such as Europe, Mexico and Australia. These conditions are being
complicated by unfavourable foreign currency exchange rates and by trade
inventory adjustments.'
The company remained optimistic about its global growth prospects.
Last month, the group reported first-quarter earnings per share 7 per cent
higher at 74 cents, excluding one-off items.
General Mills, the packaged foods and restaurants group, is to restructure
some of its consumer foods manufacturing facilities and close some
restaurants to help offset the impact of expected new federal tax and
healthcare policies.
The company said yesterday it would take a fourth-quarter charge of Dollars
45m to Dollars 50m (28 to 30 cents a share). It expected the actions to lead
to Dollars 15m in after-tax savings savings (9 cents) in fiscal 1994.
A total of 31 of the company's 1,075 restaurants in North America will be
shut down, half of the closures coming in Canada.
Mr Bruce Atwater, chairman, said fourth-quarter operating performance was
expected to be on target as were the full-year results before exceptional
items.
