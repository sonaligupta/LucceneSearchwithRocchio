FT  30 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Plucking the wrong geese


   From Mr PETER MORGAN


Sir, Your leader, 'How to pluck the geese' (October 27) does a disservice to
the wealth-creating sector, which is your constituency. Government spending
has risen by about 50 per cent in real terms since 1979-80. In the five
years between 1992-93 and 1997-98 it is expected to rise by 32 per cent. In
the five years to April 1994 government spending has been rising three times
faster than taxes.
Public spending is forecast to be Pounds 314bn in 1993-96. A Pounds 20bn cut
would be a reduction of less than 6.5 per cent. Few of your readers would
balk at achieving such a budget reduction in their own business over a
30-month period. Most of them have already done it more than once.
You conclude: 'Whatever Mr Clarke does, the geese will hiss. But he has no
prudent alternative. They will have to be plucked once again.' This is
defeatist. The industrial sector went through the mill in the early 1980s
recession. The service sector has gone through it in the early 1990s. Now it
is the turn of the public sector. You are encouraging the chancellor to
pluck the wrong geese.
