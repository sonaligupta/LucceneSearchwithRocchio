FT  29 JUL 92 / Shephard promises spotlight for NVQs


   By CHRIS TIGHE


THE government must do more to increase awareness of National Vocational
Qualifications, the new national system of assessment based on workplace
competence, Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, said yesterday.
NVQs, intended to give employers quality-assured and cost-effective ways of
meeting their skill needs, are being developed to end the under-use and
undervaluing of vocational qualifications in the UK.
Mr Michael Howard, Mrs Shephard's predecessor, said this year that NVQs
would provide the best, most comprehensive, flexible and directly relevant
system of vocational qualifications in the world.
Mrs Shephard said she was dissatisfied with awareness of NVQs. 'I'm very
satisfied with employer take-up but I'm not satisfied with the profile of
NVQs,' she said at Teesside Training and Enterprise Council, where she
launched a Pounds 500,000 Tec-funded scheme to promote NVQ training among
Cleveland companies.
Mrs Shephard said a 'big boost' to NVQs might coincide with the training
event the government was planning in September for the European Community
presidency.
Since the first NVQs became available in 1988, 150,000 certificates have
been awarded.
