FT  13 APR 94 / Building industry hiring rate rises


The construction industry is hiring twice as many permanent staff as it did
during the corresponding period last year, says a survey commissioned by the

The survey, conducted by Montrose Technical Recruitment, provides further
evidence of a broad-based recovery in one of the industries worst affected
by the recession.
