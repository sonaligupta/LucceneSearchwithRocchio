FT  23 NOV 92 / Survey of Eastern France (4): Textbook solution - Epinal's
industrial diversity brings success


   By WILLIAM DAWKINS


EPINAL, capital of the department of Les Vosges, is a textbook case of how
to respond to the long-term decline of a traditional industry.
Until 30 years ago, it was the thriving capital of the French textiles
industry, known for its images d'Epinal, popular cotton prints of French
historical scenes.
Since then Epinal and the wooded valleys around it have lost 35,000 textile
industry jobs in the face of low-cost Far Eastern competition, so that today
the sector employs only a quarter of the workforce. Les Vosges' reputation
as an area that fears it has much to lose economically was further
re-inforced when it produced a solid majority against the Maastricht treaty
in the September referendum. Yet Epinal has survived the textile downturn
surprisingly well, by turning its mechanically well-qualified and
comparatively cheap workforce to other sectors, such as paper - another
traditional Vosges industry - and engineering, which between them now employ
a quarter each of the department's workforce.
The Vosges softwood forests and the proximity of cheap nuclear-generated
electricity have attracted leading Scandinavian paper companies on the
look-out for an entry to continental Europe, such as Norsk-Skog Industrier,
which last year opened a FFr2.8bn paper plant at Golbey just outside Epinal,
the department's biggest ever foreign investment.
Engineering has become the department's biggest single employer, partly
through the creation of small independent businesses by former textile
workers.
The sector has also been helped by the arrival of foreign investors like
Trane, the US producer of heating and cooling equipment which is the largest
private sector exporter in Lorraine, and whose presence has inspired the
start-up of around 10 subcontractors since its arrival at Golbey in the
early 1960s.
'We have found here a flexible workforce, able and willing to adjust to new
techniques,' says Mr Antonio Gallo, Trane's sales director for Europe and
Africa.
