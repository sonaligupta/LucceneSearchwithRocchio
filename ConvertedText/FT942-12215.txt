FT  30 APR 94 / Markets Report: Dollar wobbles


   By PHILIP GAWITH


The Federal Reserve yesterday took the unusual step of intervening in the
markets to stop the dollar from falling through previous lows, writes Philip
Gawith.
After repeated bouts of intervention, the US currency was trading in the
evening at Y102 and DM1.6640 after touching intra-day lows of Y100.55 and
DM1.6430.
The Fed first bought dollars for D-Marks at DM1.6590 per dollar, and then
later at DM1.6585 and DM1.66. It bought dollars for yen at Y101.45-101.50
and again at Y101.90.
The last time the Fed intervened, at the behest of the Treasury, to support
the dollar was on August 17 last year when the dollar fell to Y100.30.
Elsewhere, comments from Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president,
suggesting that German interest rates might fall faster than anticipated,
led to frenzied trading in Euromark futures.
The Fed's intervention was confirmed by Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury
secretary, who commented: 'US monetary authorities intervened today in
foreign exchange markets to counter disorderly conditions. This is in line
with our previously articulated policy which recognises that excessive
volatility is counterproductive to growth. We stand ready to continue to
cooperate in foreign exchange markets.'
Intervention by the Fed overshadowed positive US data, which the market
ignored. March single family home sales rose by 11.1 per cent, the biggest
jump in six months. The purchasing management association of Chicago said
its business barometer rose to 67.6 per cent in April from 66.5.
Analysts were sceptical about whether the Fed's activities offered the
dollar more than a temporary respite. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at
Citibank, commented; 'It is round one to the Fed, but unless it is sustained
and a lot heavier, I think markets will again test the previous lows of the
dollar.'
He said that so long as US/Japan trade talks remained stalled and Japan
experienced political paralysis, 'the US administration will not be averse
to a stronger yen.'
The D-Mark had a mixed performance in Europe yesterday. It was slightly
weaker against the French franc, which closed at FFr3.427 from FFr3.429. It
closed slightly higher at L959 from L958.3 against the Italian lira.
Mr Tietmeyer's comments, delivered in a magazine interview, led to a frenzy
of afternoon activity on the futures markets. Mr Richard Phillips, analyst
at brokers GNI, said the bullish tone of the Bundesbank president's comments
had encouraged a lot of investors to start taking long positions again.
'People got very bulled up on the prospect of a rate cut,' said Mr Phillips.
Trade was heavy with the June contract trading nearly 52,000 lots. The
future closed at 94.92, 13 basis points up on Thursday's close.
The Bank of England yesterday injected Pounds 824m into the UK money markets
after forecasting an Pounds 800m shortage. Market conditions were easy with
overnight rates moving between 3 and 4 1/3 per cent.
Sterling rose against the dollar, closing at Dollars 1.5163 from Dollars
1.5073, but ended slightly lower against the D-Mark, at DM2.5126 from
DM2.5167.
