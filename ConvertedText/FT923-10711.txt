FT  29 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Higher European sugar
production estimated


   By REUTER


   RATZEBERG


SUGAR PRODUCTION looks set to rise this year in both eastern and western
Europe, FO Licht, the influential German sugar statistics agency, said in
comments accompanying its third estimate of 1992 European sugar beet
plantings, reports Reuter from Ratzeburg.
It increased its estimate for the eastern European sugar area to 3.99m
hectares (9.8m acres) from a previous forecast of 3.73m ha. The area remains
slightly below last year's 4.08m ha, however.
'When it is recalled that last season yields were extremely low it can be
appreciated that sugar output could substantially exceed last season's
figures and lead to an eastern European output more than 1m tonnes higher,'
Licht said.
On the basis of average yields for the last five seasons Licht projected
that western European output would rise by about 2m tonnes. But weather
conditions suggested, however, that the projection could well be exceed.
The area under sugar in western Europe was put at 2.66m ha, unchanged from
the last estimate issued in April and only marginally below 1991 plantings
on 2.67m ha.
The total 1992 European area was put at 6.65m ha, up from a previous
forecast of 6.39m ha but down from 6.75m ha in 1991.
