FT  29 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Fisons plant gets licence for UK after
refit


   By PAUL ABRAHAMS


FISONS, the pharmaceuticals group, yesterday said the UK's Medicines Control
Agency had relicenced its refitted Holmes Chapel plant in Cheshire.
Fisons was forced to refurbish the factory after the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) banned two products, Opticrom, a hayfever medication,
and Imferon, a blood product, following the discovery of quality control
problems. Before a plant can start manufacturing after refitting, it must be
relicenced by the Medicines Control Agency.
Analysts expect FDA officials to visit the Holmes Chapel facilities in
mid-March. They believe it may take some weeks after the visit for the FDA
to licence the site. Until then, the two products will continue to banned in
the US.
Last month Fisons said the ban would reduce its profits by Pounds 65m.
Shortly afterwards, Mr John Kerridge, chief executive and chairman, resigned
for reasons of ill-health.
Fisons shares closed up 20p at 369p.
