FT  16 MAR 94 / People: Wheatley joins with Ashtead


Alan Wheatley, a former senior London partner of Price Waterhouse, has been
appointed a non-executive director and deputy chairman of Ashtead group, the
fast-growing plant hire company.
Ashtead, which began as a Pounds 458,000 management buy-out ten years ago,
was floated on the unlisted securities market in November 1986 and was the
last winner of the USM company of the year award. Its market capitalisation
has risen from Pounds 8m to Pounds 127m and pre-tax profits have jumped from
Pounds 533,000 to around Pounds 5.2m in the current year, according to some
stock market estimates.
Chairman Peter Lewis, 53, who founded the company with managing director
George Burnett, 46, says that the company has grown to a stage where it
needs a non-executive director with 'bigger company experience'. Wheatley,
55, who stepped down as chairman of 3i last year, is a non-executive
director of NM Rothschild, British Steel, Forte and Legal & General.
