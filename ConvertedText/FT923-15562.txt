FT  01 JUL 92 / Observer: Taxing issue


A battle royal has developed in Malaysia between the Sultan of the staunchly
Muslim state of Kelantan and Anwar Ibrahim, the country's finance minister.
It's all about whether the Sultan paid a trifling MDollars 2.1m in import
tax for a Lamborghini sports car.
Originally, the car had been held by Malaysian Customs on its arrival at
Kuala Lumpur airport. Then the Sultan turned up - and simply drove the car
away. At first, the government, in the person of Anwar, insisted that the
import duty on the Lamborghini had to be paid. The Sultan dug in his heels.
Last week, the government said the proper procedures had been followed and
the issue was now settled.
Not so, says the Sultan. He says he has not paid any import tax.
Furthermore, the Sultan's palace has issued a statement insisting that the
government and Anwar make a public apology for the undue embarrassment
caused to the Sultan.
