FT  05 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: The challenge that paid off - Debbie
Harrison on Rothschild Asset Management


   By DEBBIE HARRISON


Rothschild Asset Management is the main investment management company within
the Rothschild Group, one of the world's leading independent merchant
banking and asset management organisations. Although the company has not
been rated by Standard & Poor's, several of its funds have achieved S & P's
top AAA award.
As a unit trust personal pension provider, Rothschild is one of the most
successful financial institutions to challenge the virtual monopoly held by
the life assurance offices in this multi-million pound market. Its
combination of clear charges, flexibility and good performance pushed the
Rothschild managed personal pension plan rapidly to the top of the league
tables.
Apart from Rothschild, the only other unit trust personal pension provider
now is Gartmore, while Murray Johnstone offers company unit trust pensions.
Fidelity, which withdrew from the individual personal pensions market
recently, is to enter the company market soon.
To the consumer, there might seem little to choose between a unit trust
personal pension and a life office unit-linked plan since, in both cases,
premiums buy units in a chosen fund and the price of these units goes up and
down depending on the performance of the underlying assets.
The charging structure of the two products is quite different, though. As a
unit trust group, Rothschild can pay only single premium commission of 4-5
per cent to advisers selling its products. This is financed out of the
bid/offer spread, which is levied on all contributions throughout the term.
On top of this, there is an annual management fee of 1 per cent.
Unit-linked plans also have these charges. But there are extra 'initial' or
'capital' unit charges in the early years which are used to pay the adviser
the commission that would be earned over the entire term of the plan. On top
of these extra deductions, there are policy fees and administration charges.
The point to note about unit trust personal pensions is that the charges are
explicit and there are no penalties if the contract stops early. This does
not necessarily mean they are cheaper than unit-linked plans over the long
term but unit trust pensions do offer genuine portability without penalty.
The Rothschild managed personal pension fund, which invests in a portfolio
of equities, bonds, gilts and deposits, came 11th out of 83 managed funds in
the latest Money Management survey*. Looking at results on a year-by-year
basis, however, the performance is rather volatile. The fund was a top
performer between 1988 and 1992, then took a dive. By 1993, it had slipped
into the bottom 25 per cent of funds. The UK major companies equity fund had
a similar downturn.
According to marketing director Peter Rees, the investment philosophy of the
personal plans mirrors that of the institutional pension funds. 'This leads
us to invest predominantly in high-quality equities which, over the long
term, should provide a consistent, above-average return while the fund
benefits from the enhanced marketability and security afforded by this
significant bias in favour of blue chip stocks,' he says.
'A side effect, however, has been that the fund did not participate in the
strong gains shown by second-line stocks (smaller companies) over the past
12 months and so has tended to underperform in the short term. Nevertheless,
we remain convinced that the basic strategy is correct.'
The group offers a range of funds investing in American, European and
Japanese markets. But, for investors approaching retirement, it suggests
using the managed, gilt and deposit funds to consolidate gains. A phased
switching to these funds over the seven years leading up to retirement can
be arranged. But the gilt fund, which achieved a top quartile (top 25 per
cent) position in 1989, has performed below average ever since, while the
deposit fund has performed consistently below average since its launch in
1988.
Although small in numerical terms, the 1,600 Rothschild transfer plans
account for more than 20 per cent of its total personal pension business.
Rees points out that most of the transfers came through independent advisers
who were responsible for assessing each case. He adds: 'We now issue warning
letters to all customers who come to us directly and who are considering
transferring their pension. These letters outline the main points to
consider in a transfer and recommend that clients seek full advice from
their employer and/or an independent adviser.'

Charges: At present life office illustrations of what your investment
may produce use a standard basis for charges set by Lautro (the Life
Assurance and Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation). To reveal the impact
of real charges on the final fund of Rothschild Asset Management's
managed unit-trust plan, we asked for illustrations using actual charges
for a man aged 45 who expects to retire at age 65 (ie, a 20 year
contract), paying (a) Pounds 200 per month and (b) a stand alone single
premium of Pounds 10,000. Illustrations using Lautro standard charges,
which in fact are much lower than charges used by most providers, are
shown in brackets. The last illustration gives a theoretical value if
no charges were made. The growth assumptions are Lautro's standard 6
per cent and 12 per cent.

The charges on Rothschild's plan over the full 25 year period are about
average for the industry. However, unlike most life office plans, there
is no heavy weighting of charges in the early years of the plan and so
there are no penalties on decreasing or stopping premiums, early
transfer or retirement.
