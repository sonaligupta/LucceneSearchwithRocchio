FT  15 APR 94 / Mexican kidnap threat


   By Agencies


   MEXICO CITY


Kidnappers who seized the chairman of Mexico's largest banking group last
month have threatened to kill him unless their demands are met, agencies
report from Mexico City.
'We're set on executing him if you don't fulfil our conditions,' said a copy
of a typed letter, dated Tuesday and addressed to Grupo Financiero
Banamex-Accival, which is headed by billionaire Mr Alfredo Harp Helu.
He was abducted on the morning of March 14 while driving to work from his
home in Mexico City.
The letter was accompanied by a hand-written plea, apparently from Mr Harp,
and a photograph of him beside a newspaper dated April 12. 'Pay the ransom,
my life is in danger, give me the opportunity to return to you and to my
family,' said the letter.
Banamex-Accival officials were not available to comment. Police said the
family had asked that the police stay out of negotiations.
The documents did not disclose the ransom being sought or any conditions set
by the kidnappers, who accused the financial group of callousness in hiring
insurers to assist in the case.
