FT  13 APR 94 / International Company News: Exceptional costs mask better
sales at Engen

Engen, the South African energy company, reported a decline in net profits
to R228m (Dollars 63.2m) in the six months to February, from R257m for the
corresponding period last year.
The fall was almost entirely due to the R17m exceptional cost to cover
retrenchments, and to a one-off inventory loss of R37m for the decline in
the oil price. The interim dividend was maintained at 55 cents.
The added costs masked a slight improvement in operating income, to R282m
compared with R257m last year. The retrenchments, which will reduce the
company's total workforce by around 500, will be absorbed in full over the
current financial year. The costs are likely to come to R60m.
Turnover rose to R4.03bn from R3.56bn, while borrowings were up to R512m
from R218m. This reflected increased capital expenditure on the company's
R800m Phase II upgrade project, which will give Engen the capability to
process cheaper crudes while lifting output 22 per cent.
Mr Rob Angel, chief executive, said gearing would continue to rise, from its
current 16 per cent to around 26 per cent next year, because of the
expansion.
The bulk of turnover came from domestic sales of petrol to the South African
market. These rose from 14.7m barrels to 15.2m barrels. The biggest area of
growth was in exports, which soared 133 per cent, from 1.8m barrels last
year to 4.2m barrels, and covered sales to more than 20 countries, most of
them in Africa.
Mr Angel said he hoped to see continued growth in the African market, and
noted that Engen was well-placed to raise its presence on the continent.
