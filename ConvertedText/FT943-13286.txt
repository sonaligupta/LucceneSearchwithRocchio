FT  20 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Division shares hold price rise


   By PAUL TAYLOR


Shares in Division Group closed 4p lower yesterday at 129p, maintaining most
of the 28p gain achieved on Monday after the Bristol-based virtual reality
computer technology company announced a strategic alliance and product
development agreement with Hewlett-Packard, the US computer group.
The agreement helped Division's shares climb to a high of 133p on Monday -
the company was floated at 40p a share in May last year.
The deal is designed to strengthen both companies' offerings in the growing
market for virtual reality applications in computer-aided design, training
and medicine.
As part of the agreement, virtual reality software developed by Division, an
acknowledged market leader, will be adapted to run on Hewlett-Packard's
powerful HP 9000 Series 700 workstations.
The two companies will also collaborate on future generations of
high-performance graphics products.
Division, which is due to report its interim results next month, also warned
that although sales growth continued to be 'very strong', it would
nevertheless report a deficit.
The company said the loss would reflect its continued heavy investment in
product development, particularly in the area of high performance graphics
systems.
