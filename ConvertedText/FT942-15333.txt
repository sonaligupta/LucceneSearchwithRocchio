FT  15 APR 94 / UK Company News: Export growth behind 80% rise at Lamont


   By SIMON DAVIES


Lamont Holdings, the Northern Ireland-based textiles group, reported a surge
in 1993 profits, reflecting strong export growth and a substantial
contribution from Alexander Drew, its fabric printing subsidiary.
After two years of decline, pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 11.4m, up 80
per cent on the previous Pounds 6.31m. The shares firmed 9p to 433p.
Turnover increased by 18 per cent to Pounds 136.1m, with export sales to the
Americas and east Asia almost doubled to Pounds 17m following the setting up
of sales offices in New York and Hong Kong.
Lamont's performance continued to be hampered by losses from its core Shaw
carpets business. However, all other group operations experienced growth,
and overall, the carpet divisions contributed operating profit of Pounds
1.3m, against a small loss in 1992.
Sir Desmond Lorimer, chairman, said profit margins in the carpet division
remained weak because of 'over-capacity in the industry'. This was more than
compensated for by the fabrics division, and operating profit margins
(excluding discontinued businesses) rose from 6.7 per cent to 9.3 per cent.
Shaw was also affected by a recent capital expenditure programme and an
unsuccessful push upmarket. Sir Desmond said in spite of difficult trading
conditions it was expected to return to profitability in 1994.
The fabric manufacturing and printing business remained the main
contributor, with operating profits of Pounds 10.6m. Alexander Drew, which
was acquired in April 1992, will be strengthened by the merger with
Cunningham Johnson, the recently acquired fabric printer which is on a
nearby site.
The results were hit by the elimination of Pounds 617,000 of goodwill on the
sale of the computer division, partly offset by a Pounds 394,000 profit from
a property disposal.
At the year end, net borrowings stood at Pounds 10m, marginally down from
1992, and gearing fell to 23 per cent.
A final dividend of 9p makes a total of 12.5p (12p), payable from earnings
ahead by 59 per cent to 25.57p (16.09p) per share.
