FT  06 JAN 94 / Pattern for change


   By LOUISE LUCAS


Mr Chris Patten, governor of Hong Kong, is likely to introduce the more
controversial elements of his democracy reform proposals to the Legislative
Council in March, according to the government radio, Louise Lucas reports.
Beijing has already reacted strongly to the tabling of the so-called
non-controversial elements, which include lowering the voting age to 18 from
21, and says it will dismantle all elected bodies upon regaining
sovereignty.
