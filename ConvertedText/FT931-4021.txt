FT  12 MAR 93 / International Company News: Poor film releases reduce
Paramount profits to Dollars 1m


   By ALAN FRIEDMAN


   NEW YORK


LOWER operating earnings from its entertainment division and seasonal losses
in publishing caused a sharp decline in net profits at Paramount
Communications during the first quarter of fiscal 1993 ended January 31.
The company recorded first-quarter net income of less than Dollars 1m, or 1
cent per share, compared with Dollars 18.4m, or 16 cents, in the first three
months of fiscal 1992.
Revenues also declined, to Dollars 943.7m in the quarter from Dollars 1.07bn
a year earlier.
Paramount said the weak performance of film releases resulted in lower
operating income, despite higher contributions from television programming
operations.
Entertainment results in the first quarter also reflected lower operating
income from television broadcast stations and theatrical exhibition
operations.
Paramount added that its theme parks division, acquired in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 1992, suffered a small loss.
