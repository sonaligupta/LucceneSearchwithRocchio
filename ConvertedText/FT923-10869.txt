FT  28 JUL 92 / Part-time working urged for rail staff


   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor


BRITISH RAIL wants up to one third of its staff to work part time by the end
of the decade, according to Mr Paul Watkinson, personnel director.
Only about 5 per cent of BR staff are on part-time contracts. But Mr
Watkinson told the magazine Personnel Today: 'We have to change the shape of
our labour force. We're a service business and I would be looking for
between 25 and 30 per cent part-time staff.'
He said that the changes would occur regardless of whether staff worked for
BR or a franchise holder. He added that part-timers' pay and conditions
would match those of full-timers according to the hours they worked.
BR managers believe that they run a classic 'peaks and troughs' business
making part-time work appropriate. This applies to ticket sales but also to
train driving and signalling functions.
Mr Watkinson's comments appear to confirm several recent reports that it is
the public sector that is now more concerned with increasing the number of
part-timers than the private sector.
RMT, the main rail union, described the plan as 'really stupid' and said it
was inspired by the fact that part-time workers have fewer rights and are
less likely to join unions.
Nearly one third of British companies have asked people leaving their jobs
to repay the cost of their training.
Most managers believe job leavers should repay part or all the costs of
their training, according to the magazine Personnel Today. Some 28 per cent
of companies taking part in the survey conducted by the Industrial Society
had such policies, while a further 8 per cent were considering it. Overall
55 per cent of managers favoured the idea, and only 26 per cent ruled it
out.
