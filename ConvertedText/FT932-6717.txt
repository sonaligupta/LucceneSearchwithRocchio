FT  27 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Thorp report sent to Howard


THE Pollution Inspectorate has passed its report on the public consultation
into British Nuclear Fuels' controversial Thorp reprocessing plant at
Sellafield to Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary. He is expected
to take several weeks to consider it.
The department has received legal advice that it may need to consider the
wider economic and social case for Thorp to guard against legal action by
pressure groups.
