FT  23 JUL 93 / Boots to sell French retailer for Pounds 41m

BOOTS, the retailing and pharmaceuticals group, agreed yesterday to sell its
French retail subsidiary Sephora for Pounds 40.9m, as it reported
encouraging trading figures and said it saw signs of recovery in the UK
retail sector.
Sir Christopher Benson, chairman, told an annual meeting disrupted by animal
rights protesters that group sales in the three months to June were up 7.7
per cent on last year. 'Some further recovery in the retail sector' was
expected during the year.
Sephora is being sold to French retailer Altamir for FFr360m (Pounds 40.9m),
made up of FFr178m for the shares and FFr182m to repay inter-company loans.
Sir James Blyth, chief executive, said Sephora made a profit last year in
spite of tough market conditions, but Boots' strategy demanded that all
businesses were capable of producing 'significant value' for shareholders.
'It is Boots' only retail interest outside the UK and will not meet our very
demanding performance criteria in the foreseeable future,' he said.
Sephora has made a substantial turnaround in the past few years, from an
operating loss of FFr60m in 1988 to a small profit of FFr0.27m last year.
With 38 shops, it is the market leader in a highly fragmented sector which
numbers 2,500 French cosmetics and perfume retailers.
Shareholders heard yesterday that all Boots' businesses except Do It All,
the DIY joint venture with W H Smith, enjoyed sales increases in the first
quarter. Sales were up 5.3 per cent at Boots the Chemists, 10.4 per cent at
Halfords, 15.8 per cent in Children's World, 8.6 per cent in Boots
Opticians, 3.2 per cent at A G Stanley, 11.1 per cent in Boots Healthcare
International, and 17.1 per cent in Contract Manufacturing. But sales at Do
It All were down 7.2 per cent in a 'severely depressed' market.
Sir Christopher reiterated the company's commitment to its pharmaceuticals
division - where sales were up 11.5 per cent - despite the withdrawal of the
Manoplax heart drug. The division was developing a 'strong and encouraging
new product pipeline', including an anti-obesity agent, schizophrenia
treatment and anti-diabetic agent.
