FT  05 AUG 92 / Observer: Soldiering on


In all the comings and goings at NatWest it is easy to forget that dear old
Tom Frost, who was replaced as NatWest's chief executive by young Derek
Wanless only four months ago, still works there.
While all the Blue Arrow prosecutions have been halted, Frost, who has never
been charged with any offence, is still centrally involved in the DTI's
ongoing investigation into the affairs of the National Westminster Bank.
Both Frost and NatWest vehemently deny any suggestion of a cover-up, but
Frost still decided to withdraw to the sidelines as a deputy chairman to
give himself time to present his case.
Since he is only a year away from retirement, the outcome has no bearing on
his future career. But his decision to relinquish the reins will look more
like noble self-sacrifice if his bank is exonerated.
