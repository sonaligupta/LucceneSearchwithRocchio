FT  29 OCT 93 / 450MW dam to begin operating in 1997


A controversial 450MW dam in southern Chile, potentially the first phase of
a Dollars 3bn hydroelectric project, is likely to begin operating in 1997
following signing by the International Finance Corporation of a Dollars 120m
loan deal. The Pangue dam, already under construction, is likely to cost
Dollars 450m.
Agreement from the IFC, which also plans to take an equity stake of up to
Dollars 4.7m, removes an important obstacle from a project plagued by
environmentalist opposition and courtroom wrangles.
Opponents say Pangue, the first of a possible six dams, will endanger the
ecosystem of the Bo-Bo river and threaten the Pehuenche Indian culture.
Endesa, the dam's main shareholder, says environmental impact will be
minimal; only 400 hectares of land will be flooded and a handful of people
relocated.
Although the IFC agreement has been signed, disbursement of funds depends on
'completion and public release of a satisfactory downstream impact study',
according to Mr Kent Lupberger, IFC manager for the region.
