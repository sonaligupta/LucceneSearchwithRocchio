FT  13 APR 94 / International Company News: Bank of New York lifts profits
in opening quarter

   NEW YORK


Bank of New York, the north-eastern banking group reportedly currently
contemplating a merger with its regional rival Fleet Financial, yesterday
unveiled first quarter profits of Dollars 178m, up from Dollars 134m a year
earlier.
The results translated into fully-diluted earnings per share of a record
Dollars 1.75, up from Dollars 1.30 a share in the same quarter of 1993.
The bank reported that net interest income increased four per cent to
Dollars 396m in the quarter, thanks to wider interest rate spreads, and
increasing loan demand.
Bank of New York also said that its credit card business was strong during
the quarter, as was fee income business, particularly from securities
processing, syndications and factoring. Income from foreign exchange and
other trading, however, fell during the period.
The results cheered investors on Wall Street, who bid up Bank of New York's
shares Dollars 2 to Dollars 55 3/4 on the New York Stock Exchange.
