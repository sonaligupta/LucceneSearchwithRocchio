FT  16 NOV 93 / Observer: Off-balance


Hilmar Kopper, boss of Deutsche Bank, does not miss a trick. Like any other
sensible banker, he is mindful of the topsy-like growth of those
clever-clever instruments such as yield curve swaps, look-back options and
forward rate agreements, lumped under the catch-all name of derivatives.
Hence, quizzed recently as to whether he had yet thought of a nickname for
the Trianon tower, the bank's third skyscraper in Frankfurt opened earlier
this month, Kopper hesitated not a moment. Given that the newcomer is taller
than the existing pair, dubbed 'Soll und Haben' (assets and liabilities),
why not call it 'derivatives'?
