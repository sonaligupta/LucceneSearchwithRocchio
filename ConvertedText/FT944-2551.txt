FT  16 DEC 94 / Arts: Today's Television


   By MARTIN HOYLE


There's something tawdry about Friday night's programming, as if those telly
execs had written off most of their viewers to post-work drinks or office
outings. Commuters who make it home by sixish in the misguided hope of
something good on the box can choose between a repeated American sitcom
(C4), a repeated Australian soap (ITV), puppets on BBC2 followed by a
repeated tec series a quarter-century old with the 'cult' label (that is, it
never achieved mass popularity) slapped on it. The news on BBC1 reassures us
that 'The Best Television in the World' still caters for adults at twilight.
So does Sounds of the Sixties (7.15pm BBC2). Try to work out why the Bee
Gees made it big and Procul Harum disappeared. Deploy the video to
circumvent the overlapping Harry Enfield and Chums (9.30pm BBC1) and The
Trial (9pm BBC2). The latter is too slick to contribute to the argument over
televising live court proceedings. Enjoy it, like any other soapish
entertainment set in the city that inspired the story of Jekyll and Hyde.
