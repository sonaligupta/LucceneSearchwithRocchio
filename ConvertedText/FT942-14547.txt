FT  20 APR 94 / M0 estimate cut to 5.6% growth


The Bank of England has cut its estimates for M0 growth, the narrow measure
of money supply, after changes to the way it calculates seasonal
adjustments.
M0 growth in the 12 months to March is now estimated at 5.6 per cent,
compared with the earlier estimate of 5.8 per cent. Notes and coins, the
largest element of M0, grew at 5.8 per cent in the 12 months to March,
against the previous estimate of 6.1 per cent. Figures for earlier months
have also been adjusted.
