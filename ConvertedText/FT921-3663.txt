FT  13 MAR 92 / Letter: UK potato board contests reckoning of chips


   From Mr JOHN A MARKHAM


Sir, Readers of David Blackwell's article ('Chips down for UK potato board',
February 27) on the industry should be made aware that, since 1989, imports
of processed potato products have levelled off in spite of three consecutive
dry, low yielding seasons.
Fully 70 per cent of British imports of processed products come from the
Netherlands. We imported 150,500 tonnes of Dutch products in 1991. France
imported 100,800 tonnes and Germany 224,100 tonnes from the Netherlands that
year. As neither Germany nor France have area controls, this suggests
British import levels are not determined by the Potato Marketing Scheme, but
relate to competitive advantages and policies of the Dutch.
The prices of potatoes in the UK do not seem to have the adverse effect on
profitability that you suggest. The Grocer (November 11) compares returns on
capital for food companies in the UK. Nearly all those with substantial
potato interests perform above the food industry average; better than most
other industrial sectors.
