FT  12 APR 94 / Portugal's budget deficit plans: Economic Watch


Portugal's 1995 budget is being drawn up with a planned primary deficit of
about 5 per cent of gross domestic product, according to Mr Eduardo Catroga,
the finance minister. This would represent a fall from a planned primary
deficit of 6 per cent this year and a revised deficit of 7.1 per cent in
1992, he said. 'The fundamental guideline of the 1995 budget is a
continuation of the objective of budget consolidation,' he said. He
reiterated the centre-right government's determination to reach the budget
deficit target set in its programme of economic convergence with the
European Union.
