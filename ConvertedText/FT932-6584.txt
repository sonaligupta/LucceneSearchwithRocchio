FT  27 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: La Rosa signs exploration
venture


La Rosa, wholly owned by Bolivian mining group Emusa and individual
enterpreneurs has signed an exploration joint venture with Billiton, part of
the Royal Dutch Shell oil group. Exploration work is expected to start in
the next few weeks. The contract covers the Don Mario ore body in tropical
eastern Bolivia. Preliminary exploration, including bore holes, have
revealed an estimated 7m tonnes at ore reserves in total. The ore body is a
polymetallic mix of copper, gold and silver. The contract should have a
duration of 2 to 3 years, with production starting in up to 6 years. Shell
has had an offer for Billiton from Gencor, the South African group, but
Emusa believes the La Rosa deal will not be affected.
Pan-Andean Resources, a British quoted company, was yesterday signing a
major oil exploration joint venture with YPFB, the Bolivian state
hydrocarbons group. Mr John J. Teeling, Pan-Andean chairman, said the joint
venture covers 1.39m hectares in the tropical Chapare region in central
Bolivia. The contract is for 30 years.
