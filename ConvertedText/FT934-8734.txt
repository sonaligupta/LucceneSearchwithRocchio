FT  13 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Complex structure, attractive
returns


   By PHILIP COGGAN


THE NEW business expansion scheme from the Anglia Polytechnic University is
so complicated you almost need a degree to understand it, writes Philip
Coggan. Flexit 2, sponsored by Richard Ellis Venture Consultants, could run
for as much as 31 years, at the option of the university. Nevertheless, it
is designed to offer attractive returns even if it runs beyond the normal
five-year period.
The Pounds 7.7m raised will be used to provide accommodation for students on
campus in Chelmsford. At the end of year five, the university will have the
option to buy back the properties at the equivalent of a share price of
128p. That would give higher-rate taxpayers an annualised return of 14.92
per cent, or 10.67 per cent basic rate taxpayers.
A 128p return is higher than anything available on other university schemes.
But Flexit 2 is not cash-backed and the university might decide not to
exercise its option, so there is a higher risk.
If the option is not exercised, the properties will be transferred into two
trusts in December 1998. Investors will receive an immediate cash payment of
29p a share plus a rental income, equivalent to around 51.8p a share over
the next five years. The university will then have further options to buy
back the properties after 10, 15, 20 and 25 years. The sums are designed to
give investors a gross return of 14.36 per cent over 10 years. If they pay
tax at 40 per cent on the rental income, the return falls to 12.64 per cent
net; however, the rental income is classed as Schedule A for tax purposes
and can be offset against some other property borrowings.
The university will have a strong incentive to buy the property after five
years since, at that point, the cost of its funds will rise substantially.
The most likely outcome, according to Richard Ellis, is a scheme exit after
five years.
