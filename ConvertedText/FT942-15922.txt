FT  13 APR 94 / Jobs strategy for Derwentside


A draft strategy to create at least 2,600 jobs in Derwentside, County
Durham, by 2000 was outlined yesterday to councillors.
The district, which suffered from the 1980 closure of the Consett
steelworks, the shutdown of other industries and the earlier loss of coal
mining, has already been the focus of intensive job creation for more than a
decade.
