FT  12 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow climbs as end is seen to
correction


   By PATRICK HARVERSON


   NEW YORK


Wall Street
US share prices ended mostly higher yesterday as the stock market started a
week packed with important economic statistics in an upbeat fashion, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 14.57 up at 3,688.83, while the
Standard & Poor's 500 gained 2.77 at 449.87. Secondary indices, however,
languished, with the American Stock Exchange composite closing 0.55 off at
440.66 and the Nasdaq composite 0.60 easier at 748.11. New York SE volume
was moderate at 243m shares, and rises outpaced declines by 1,167 to 1,008.
Although equities opened firmer, it was not until late morning that blue
chips began to post anything more than modest gains. Analysts said there was
no particular news that inspired the buying, and attributed the rise to a
growing feeling among investors that the market's recent correction - which
saw the Dow lose 10 per cent of its value over two months - was ended.
Market sentiment was also seen as positive ahead of this week's crucial
inflation data. The March producer prices index is due out today, and is
expected to show only a slight increase in prices, while an equally modest
rise is forecast for the March consumer prices index, which will be released
tomorrow. Investors seem confident that the data will reassure the bond
market that inflation is not getting out of hand, in spite of the recent
sharp spurt in economic growth.
Although the market has been unnerved in recent weeks by political
developments overseas, traders said the raids by US fighters on Serbian
mil-itary positions in Bosnia-Hercegovina overnight and again yesterday had
little impact on trading.
Automobile manufacturers were all higher in the morning, buoyed by reports
that analysts believe rising interest rates will not undermine the strong
recovery in car sales, but they dropped back from their peaks. Chrysler
climbed Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 52 1/4 in heavy volume before falling back
to finish Dollars 1/4 up at Dollars 51 1/8. General Motors gained a net
Dollars 3/8 at Dollars 58, but Ford Motor failed to stay in positive
territory and closed Dollars 3/8 down at Dollars 58.
Bank stocks were in demand as Wall Street anticipated another strong
quarterly reporting season from the sector. BankAmerica rose Dollars 3/4 to
Dollars 41 1/2, Chemical Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 38 5/8, Citicorp Dollars 1
to Dollars 39 3/8 and Nationsbank Dollars 2 to Dollars 51 3/8.
On the Nasdaq market, leading technology issues were mixed. Intel lost
Dollars 3/16 at Dollars 69 3/16.
Canada
Toronto closed a sluggish session lower on tumbling gold shares and a soft
bond market. The TSE 300 index shed 24.4 to 4,303.0 and falls led advances
by 436 to 324 after volume of 45.5m shares valued at CDollars 566m.
Twelve of the 14 sub-indices declined. The golds group dropped 2.8 per cent
as the bullion price in New York fell USDollars 6.30 to USDollars 378.25 an
ounce.
Brazil
Brokers in Sao Paulo said that a 7.9 per cent rise in share prices reflected
a thin market, and buying to square portfolios ahead of the futures index
and options settlements tomorrow and next Monday. The Bovespa index was
1,221 higher at 16,595 at the close.
