FT  12 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Move to push futures funds in
Europe


   By TRACY CORRIGAN


NEWPORT Investment Management is launching the first offshore managed
futures fund to be advised solely by UK-based specialists. The Newport
Number 1 Fund, launched today, will focus on growth, while two subsequent
funds will focus on protection and income and will be marketed to investment
managers, writes Tracy Corrigan.
The move represents a further effort to promote the growth of a European
managed futures industry. While the US managed futures industry now has more
than Dollars 20bn under management, the market in Europe is still at an
early stage.
European investors have shown some resistance to the concept of futures as a
separate asset class, and often view futures funds as risky.
Those funds which have been marketed in Europe are typically managed in the
US, where there is a large pool of expertise among so-called commodity
trading advisers (CTAs). The Newport fund will have a team of six
sub-advisers who come from both trading and fund management backgrounds.
'Derivatives have emerged as a new asset class at a time when conventional
instruments are struggling to meet investors' expectations,' said Mr Garnet
Harrison, chairman of Newport Investment Management.
