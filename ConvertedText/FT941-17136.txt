FT  06 JAN 94 / Docklands rail chief decision


Sir Anthony Gill is likely to be the next chairman of the Docklands Light
Railway, which connects the City of London to Canary Wharf and east London.
The nomination of Sir Anthony, chairman and chief executive of Lucas, the
car parts group, is expected to be ratified at a DLR board meeting tomorrow.
However, he is not expected to take up the position until the spring, when
Mr George Simpson, at British Aerospace, takes over at Lucas.
