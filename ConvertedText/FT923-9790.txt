FT  03 AUG 92 / Poor outlook for building equipment


   By ANDREW BAXTER


THE European construction equipment market outside Germany is forecast to
fall 18 per cent this year, according to a report which further underlines
the combined effects of German unification and recession elsewhere.
Corporate Intelligence Group of London, in a mid-term review this week,
identifies Germany as the only market that will grow appreciably this year,
with unit sales predicted to rise 16 per cent from 36,429 last year to
42,480.
The group's forecast for the European market overall this year remains
unchanged at 5 per cent. But its forecast for Germany contrasts sharply with
its prediction in the spring of a fall in demand this year as
post-unification equipment buying tailed off: there is continuing
'phenomenal' demand for wheeled loaders, mini-excavators and wheeled
excavators, according to the group's latest review.
The better-than-expected performance in Germany is balanced by predictions
of much sharper declines in Italy, Spain, and France, where prospects have
worsened over the past three months. And apart from Norway, where a marginal
1 per cent increase from a low base is predicted, all Scandinavia will fall
further into deep recession.
The UK market is likely to fall a further 4 per cent from 9,212 units to
8,860 this year, says the group.
