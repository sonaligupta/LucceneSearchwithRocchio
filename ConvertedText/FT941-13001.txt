FT  27 JAN 94 / UK Company News: TDG in talks to sell engineering offshoot


Transport Development Group is negotiating to sell Beck & Pollitzer
Engineering to its management.
With annual sales of more than Pounds 20m, B&P Engineering is an
international contractor engaged mainly in industrial removal and
installation contracts. Net assets were Pounds 7.3m at December 31 1992.
Mr Michael Cox, managing director of TDG's hire division, said the company
was outside TDG's main activities and a sale to management would allow the
group to develop further its core activities.
