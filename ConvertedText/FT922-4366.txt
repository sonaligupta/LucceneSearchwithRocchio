FT  05 JUN 92 / Trebling in number of water disconnections


   By RICHARD EVANS


THE NUMBER of water-supply disconnections nearly trebled in the last
financial year, according to Ofwat, the industry's economic regulator.
Ofwat said the figures, published today, were 'very worrying'. A total of
21,286 homes in England and Wales had their supplies cut off in 1991-92,
compared with 7,673 in the previous year.
The National Consumer Council described the figures as 'horrifying'. It
said: 'As water charges are bound to rise in future, the problem will only
get worse.' The National Association of Citizens' Advice Bureaux demanded
tougher safeguards to protect vulnerable people who could not pay their
bills.
Ofwat gave four possible explanations for the rise: higher bills in a
recession; increased efforts by the companies to recover debts; rising home
repossessions; and direct billing to council tenants.
The figures are certain to fuel criticism of the water companies, which have
been under fire for rising charges, big profits and high salaries for senior
executives.
The surge in disconnections is in contrast to the trends in the electricity
and gas industries. Electricity disconnections in the UK fell from 70,000 in
1989 to 55,000 the following year and to 38,720 last year. About 18,000 gas
customers were disconnected last year, a fall of 1,000 on the previous year.
The fall is due in both cases largely to the introduction of pre-payment
meters.
Top of the water disconnections league was South Staffordshire, which turned
off the tap in 3,494 homes last year. The company also had the highest rate
of disconnections for every 10,000 homes billed, 75.87 - about seven times
the national average.
It said it owed a duty to its paying customers to collect money from those
who would not pay, but help was always available for those with genuine
difficulties. Of the households disconnected, 80 per cent paid and were
reconnected on the same day.
Others with a high rate of disconnections for every 10,000 homes billed
were: Mid Kent (37.05), Cambridge (33.16), and Welsh Water (28.66). Among
those with the lowest rate were Thames (0.21), Wessex (0.94), North Surrey
(0.64), Cholderton and Wrexham (both nil).
