FT  28 JAN 94 / Radioactive waste 'should be buried'


   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent


Highly radioactive nuclear waste should be buried deep underground, one of
the authors of a new report on managing nuclear waste said yesterday.
But Mr Peter Saunders, an energy consultant formerly with the UK Atomic
Energy Authority, said that 'time is on our side' as much of the high-level
waste produced in the past 20 years would have to cool for several more
decades. This would give scientists time to evaluate the best techniques.
The report, compiled by a panel of chemists and energy specialists for
Brunel University, London, surveys the methods used for storing nuclear
waste in Europe.
The government has not yet announced whether the forthcoming review of the
nuclear industry will cover the controversial question of the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste.
