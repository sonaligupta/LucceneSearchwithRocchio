FT  15 NOV 93 / International Company News: Konica to reduce workforce by
10%

KONICA, the photographic materials and business machine maker, reported a
32.6 per cent fall in pre-tax profit to Y3.38bn (Dollars 318m) for the half
year to September and said that its workforce would be cut by almost 10 per
cent over the next two years.
Sales for the period slipped by 8.6 per cent to Y168.2bn, as the yen's
appreciation hurt export earnings. There was an operating loss of Y652m, its
first in 24 years, but success in foreign exchange dealings helped the
company to report a pre-tax profit.
Konica intends to cut its workforce from 5,500 to 5,000 by March 1996, but
said this would be achieved through hiring fewer graduates, and not by
making workers take early retirement, which is still controversial in Japan.
For the full year, Konica expects a pre-tax profit of Y5bn, compared to
Y7.6bn last year, on sales of Y340bn, down just over 1 per cent.
