FT  06 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris tumbles as Euro Disney
loses ground


   By Our Markets Staff


THE APPROACH of another public holiday left northern Europe muted and mixed
yesterday, as it digested this week's 'No' vote in Copenhagen and the French
decision to go on the referendum trail. But Mediterranean bourses were more
clearly depressed, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS took another tumble, but this time it had nothing to do with the
aftermath of the Danish vote. Euro Disney took centre stage as investors
began to sell on almost any excuse, some analysts said. Weakness here fed
through into the CAC-40 which finished 13.29 lower at 1,981.58, although off
the day's low of 1,974.99, for a fall of 2.5 per cent over the week.
The theme park made a number of comments after the close on Thursday which
led to a wave of selling when trading opened: the company said that it did
not expect to make a profit this year and is disappointed at the attendance
figures over the first 50 days.
County NatWest in London has cut its dividend forecast to FFr1.00 from
FFr1.50 and notes that the planned second park has been postponed. A
downgrading of Walt Disney, Euro Disney's US parent, by Morgan Stanley later
in the day only added to the stock's woes and it sank to a year's low of
FFr108.1 before firming a little to close down FFr5.80, or 5 per cent at
FFr109.50 with some 1.7m shares traded.
Other features of the day included Bernard Tapie Finance, up FFr3.50 at
FFr138.50 after a brief suspension in the morning on group net loss for
1991. Geophysique advanced FFr44.00 to FFr684.00 on good first quarter
results and prospects for the year, while Promodes was FFr80.00 firmer at
FFr3,500 following a positive analysts meeting.
FRANKFURT saw some action in second liners as the majors stayed mainly flat.
After a 1.59 gain to 714.27 for the FAZ at midsession, the DAX index closed
3.24 lower at 1,789.07; falls on the week were 1.0, and 0.8 per cent.
Volume fell from DM6.8bn to DM5.6bn, anticipating Monday's holiday.
Linotype, one of the disappointments of 1991, rose another DM17 to DM418 on
higher orders and the indication of a return to the dividend list this year.
Steels rose after a Commerzbank report gave measured, but limited, support
to their cyclical recovery prospects. Preussag rose DM3.60 to DM430.50 and
Klockner-Werke by DM2 to DM126.50.
Berliner Bank, state controlled, rose DM11 to DM290 after the Berlin city
coalition government approved its merger with two other state-owned banks.
MILAN reacted to a rise of half a percentage point in the Bank of Italy's
interest rate on advances to banks. This was followed after hours by a Banco
di Napoli increase of a half a point in prime and top rates, and three
quarters of a point in other rates.
The Naples-based bank is one of Italy's leading commercial banks and its
lead is likely to be followed. Meanwhile, the Comit index fell 5.48 to
487.42 for a loss of 1.8 per cent on the week. Banks and insurances were
weak on the interest rate move but Fiat tried to lead the way down, dropping
L118 to L5,282 before recovering to L5,330 on the kerb.
ZURICH was stirred only by Sandoz, described as particularly undervalued in
a report on Swiss chemicals majors by Mr Jonathan Spink of Williams de Broe.
Sandoz certificates topped the active list and rose SFr90 to SFr2,920 as the
SMI index closed 3.1 lower at 1,918.8, little changed on the week.
AMSTERDAM weakened slightly in spite of encouraging results on Thursday from
KLM and Ahold. The CBS Tendency index closed down 0.1 at 130.5 and was 0.4
per cent lower on the week.
Ahold improved Fl 1.00 or 1.1 per cent to Fl 88.20 following first quarter
results which came out after the close on Thursday. KLM likewise had a
reasonable day, advancing to the day's high of Fl 41.10 before easing to
close up 10 cents at Fl 40.40. Prudential Securities of the US, however, has
cut its rating for the airline group to hold from buy.
Aegon was again active, up 50 cents at Fl 124.20. The insurer has set next
Tuesday for its 2-for-1 stock split. Nedlloyd weakened on options selling,
down 90 cents at Fl 59.50.
BRUSSELS strengthened with trading in Solvay accounting for some 20 per cent
of total volume. The Bel-20 index firmed 1.44 to 1,225.54 but was down 0.6
per cent on the week. Petrofina saw its fourth consecutive fall to close
down BFr75 at BFr10,575 in volume of some 6,140 shares.
MADRID weakened as the market continued to react to the Danish 'No' vote on
the Maastricht treaty. The general index ended down 3.42 to 254.64, a drop
of 2.45 per cent over the week. However, analysts are forecasting lower
inflation data next week which is expected to improve sentiment.
STOCKHOLM featured losses at SE Banken where the A fell SKr2 to SKr33.50,
and the Affarsvarlden General index dropped 5.4 to 974.5 for a loss of 1.7
per cent on the week.
HELSINKI continued to fall in slow trade ahead of the next two weeks' crop
of interim results. The Hex index closed 3.2 lower at 813.7, 2.9 per cent
lower on the week.
