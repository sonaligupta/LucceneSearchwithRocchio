Vinythai, the Thai polyvinyl chloride (PVC) joint venture controlled by
Solvay of Belgium and Thailand's Charoen Pokphand group, is planning to
raise about Bt1.3bn (Dollars 52m) with a public flotation of one-sixth of
its shares on the Stock Exchange of Thailand.
Mr Thada Savetsila, a senior Vinythai executive responsible for marketing
and sales, said the main reason for this public offering by a Thai
petrochemical company was to refinance Vinythai's domestic debt.
Some of the proceeds will also be used to fund Vinythai's Dollars 200m
second phase. This will produce chlorine and vinyl chloride monomer (VCM), a
raw material for PVC, and should be completed by the end of next year. VCM
is currently imported.
Vinythai says its Dollars 300m first phase, completed two years ago,
produces 150,000 tonnes of PVC a year and has a Thai market share of 38 per
cent.
Shares are being sold at about Bt30 to Bt35 each. Some 75 per cent will be
reserved for Thai buyers and the remainder for foreign investors. The
company is publicising the offer this week with a roadshow in Hong Kong and
Singapore. Baring Brothers is international leader manager.
Among the lenders to Vinythai is the International Finance Corporation, the
private sector funding arm of the World Bank.
