FT  16 JUN 93 / Call for Banda to step aside


   By REUTER


   BLANTYRE


MALAWI opposition groups yesterday claimed victory in a referendum over the
one-party rule of President-for-life Kamuzu Banda and demanded he step aside
for a coalition government of national unity, Reuter reports from Blantyre.
Unofficial counts by the United Democratic Front (UDF) which it said were
based on returns by more than half the registered voters, gave between 73
and 86 per cent of the poll to those campaigning for western-style
dem-ocracy.
In a speech to hundreds of cheering, singing supporters at his headquarters
in Blantyre, Mr Bakili Muluzito, UDF leader, formally claimed victory in
mid-afternoon.
But independent analysts cautioned that many votes remained to be counted,
particularly in conservative, remote rural areas ripe for intimidation. They
pointed to sweeping successes by Mr Banda in the central region, where his
ruling Malawi Congress party (MCP) appeared to be taking 70 per cent of
votes. The opposition seemed to be registering landslides in the south, the
most populous area, and the north.
But some United Nations monitors said privately the opposition appeared to
be heading for a convincing win.
Mr Chakufwa Chihana, newly-freed trade unionist leader of the Alliance for
Democracy (Aford), which teamed with the UDF to fight Mr Banda, told
reporters in the capital Lilongwe that Mr Banda should resign as life
president of the MCP and become the figurehead of a transitional government
to prepare for multi-party elections.
'He no longer has the support of the country. We will give him a smooth
exit,' he said. 'Banda should call on me as executive prime minister to form
a council of ministers drawn from Aford, the UDF and the MCP.'
