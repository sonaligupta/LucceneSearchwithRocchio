FT  29 JAN 92 / Algerian party split on changes


   By REUTER


   ALGIERS


ALGERIA'S former ruling party, divided by the collapse of a three-year
experiment in democracy, decided yesterday to call a national conference,
Reuter reports from Algiers.
The National Liberation Front central committee, which began an emergency
meeting on Saturday, failed to decide whether to support the nation's new
rulers and whether the party's leadership should be changed.
FLN secretary-general Abdelhamid Mehri was a supporter of former President
Chadli Benjedid's democratic reforms, which were scrapped after Islamic
fundamentalists gained an unbeatable lead in the country's first multi-party
parliamentary election.
Many in the party want to endorse this month's army-backed upheaval in which
Mr Chadli resigned, the half-finished election was cancelled and
fundamentalist preachers were ordered to keep politics out of the mosques.
The new FLN meeting will include central committee members and
representatives of the rank and file.
Mr Mehri suggested yesterday that the emergency meeting be suspended and the
conference held.
'If the central committee wants me to announce my resignation to facilitate
things, I am ready to do so,' he told the committee.
He has faced a barrage of criticism from party ranks after he described the
new presidential council, headed by formerly exiled FLN dissident Mohamed
Boudiaf, as unconstitutional, and held talks with Islamic fundamentalists.
He first suggested the 15-man political bureau he heads should resign en
masse, but at a session on Monday offered only his own resignation.
The BBC, quoting Algiers radio, said early yesterday the FLN political
bureau had resigned. Committee members said no decision on a leadership
change had been taken.
