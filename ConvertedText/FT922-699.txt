FT  26 JUN 92 / Letter: IMF not prevaricating over Russian economic reform


   From SHAILENDRA J ANJARIA


Sir, Like you, the International Monetary Fund would like to see economic
reform in Russia proceeding as rapidly as possible (Leading Article: 'Russia
and the IMF', and 'IMF will advance Moscow Dollars 1bn', June 24). I am also
glad that you recognise the serious risk of hyperinflation. However, your
criticism of the IMF for prevaricating shows that you and your correspondent
in Moscow, John Lloyd, have been seriously misinformed.
In particular, it is not true that the IMF has insisted on balancing the
budget. We recognise the case for some foreign financing of the budget
deficit. Furthermore, your claims that the IMF has been insisting that oil
prices should be allowed to rise to world market levels this year and that
it has been trying to force all states of the former USSR to remain within
the rouble area are totally untrue.
The IMF has always understood the reason for the Russian government's wish
to have a gradual rise in oil prices to world levels over a two-year period,
as set out in the government's memorandum of economic policies in February.
The Fund's position on the choice of currency is set out clearly in the
managing director's speech at Georgetown University in April. The Fund
co-operated very closely with Estonia, the first state of the ex-USSR to
introduce its own currency.
Finally, the agreement between Mr Gaidar and the managing director last week
related to the procedures for speeding up the remaining work and not, as
implied by your reporter, to an agreement on a particular programme which
the Fund would support. Negotiations will soon resume in Moscow with a view
to reaching agreement on policies that we could recommend for international
support.
