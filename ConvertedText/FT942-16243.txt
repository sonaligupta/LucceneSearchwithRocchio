FT  12 APR 94 / Dublin to ease investment


   By TIM COONE


   DUBLIN


Ireland's 1994 finance bill, to be published today, includes measures to
improve the investment climate for small and medium-size businesses. It will
also provide additional attractions for the development of Dublin's offshore
financial centre and the city's derelict docklands. Mr Bertie Ahern, finance
minister, said the overall effect of the measures should have a 'broadly
neutral' effect on the government's borrowing requirement thanks to the
additional economic activity expected to be generated.
The measures include raising the thresholds for VAT registration and
increasing relief on capital gains tax, the introduction of capital
allowances for the purchase of computer software, and an easing of
restrictions on business expansion schemes. Of interest to UK mushroom
growers will be the ending of the preferential 10 per cent corporation tax
rate for Irish growers from this June.
