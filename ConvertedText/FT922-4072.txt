FT  08 JUN 92 / Letter: Maastricht ratification would herald legal maze for
business


   From Mrs CELIA HAMPTON


Sir, Politicians might like to consider the plight of the European
businessman - an intended beneficiary of the single market of 1993 - if the
11 decide to ratify the Maastricht amendments without Denmark.
In 1993, the businessman will have to obey the amended EC Treaty in 10
countries, including its new legally-binding objectives. Some of these, such
as the protection of consumers and the environment, are highly relevant to
everyday business and will be given practical meaning by the European Court.
In the UK, he will be able to ignore some of the employment-related rules
agreed by the 10, but he will have to comply with the new objectives. In
Denmark, he will have to comply with Community law as it is at present, but
he can ignore the new objectives. In Sweden, Switzerland or the other EFTA
countries, he will also have to obey existing Community law, without the new
objectives, under the EEA Agreement, but reliance on Community law will be
more precarious because there will be no common court to enforce it. In
Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland he will have to obey the parts of
Community law which are embodied in the three Association Agreements.
These extra layers of Community law will be in addition to the burden of
complying with local national laws. One could hardly blame the businessman
for staying at home: he will need a battery of lawyers to advise him every
time he strays abroad. For whose benefit were the Community and its single
market conceived?
For Community law, the Maastricht compromise allowing the UK to secede from
part of the Treaty (the 'social protocol') contained the seeds of
destruction. Adoption of the Maastricht amendments by only some of the EC
will secure germination.
