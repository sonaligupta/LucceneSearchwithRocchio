FT  19 APR 94 / Observer: Good Hope


The white South Africans who have bought up just about every seat on flights
out of the country before the election have mostly purchased return tickets
 -not least because they are cheaper than one-way fares.
One of their number who really will be ditching the return portion is
39-year-old Graham Bell, until recently the highly rated chief economist for
Johannesburg brokers Ivor, Jones, Roy. He arrives at Barings on Thursday to
start his new job as head of the merchant bank's South African sales and
research desk in London. A Jo'burg office is also planned, serving as a
regional base for business in other southern African countries, too.
The bank's timing may look to be on the foolhardy side of brave, but is no
doubt born of the confidence derived from beating other UK houses fair and
square into almost every other emerging market to date.
