FT  12 MAR 93 / Brewers warn of price rise on beer


   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE


BREWERS and beer drinkers across the country are urging the government to
drop a regulation - set to be enforced in April next year - that may spell
the end for the head on a pint of beer. The Brewers Society said that
abiding by the regulations might add 6p to the price of a pint.
Section 43 of the Weights and Measures Act requires a pint to be entirely
liquid - with no froth. But almost nobody outside Whitehall appears to want
the new regulation. There were only 23 formal complaints about short measure
throughout the country in 1991 - one for every 256m pints served.
The Campaign for Real Ale thinks that better training for bar staff and a
bit of common sense would ensure that customers were satisfied.
The society says the changes would mean ending the use of brim measure
glasses and adds that the re-equipment of every bar with line-measure
glasses would cost Pounds 19m.
Alternatively, the change could mean replacing bar pumps with a metered
dispensing system. If only 10 per cent of bars were converted, the society
estimates, it would cost Pounds 13.5m.
The society is asking the Department of Trade and Industry to reconsider by
examining the prime minister's deregulation initiative. This calls for a
review of rules that impose costs on industry out of all proportion to the
problems they are meant to solve.
