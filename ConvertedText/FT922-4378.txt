FT  05 JUN 92 / Miners offer pit buyout plans


REDUNDANT miners from Thurcroft Colliery in South Yorkshire, which closed in
December, will today present British Coal with plans for a buyout to save
the pit.
The proposal follows an employee buyout of Monktonhall colliery in Scotland
last month. If the Thurcroft plan succeeds, it will be seen as confirmation
that buyouts are an option for doomed pits.
