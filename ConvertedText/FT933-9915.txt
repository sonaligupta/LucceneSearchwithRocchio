FT  06 AUG 93 / International Company News: Quaker Oats edges ahead to
Dollars 575m for year


   By NIKKI TAIT


QUAKER OATS, the Chicago-based cereals, pet foods and beverage company, said
yesterday that earnings per share in the year to end-June rose by an
underlying 31 per cent to Dollars 4.25, excluding the effects of adopting
new accounting standards, restructuring charges and gains on assets sales.
At the operating level, Quaker saw profits rise from Dollars 540.2m to
Dollars 575.2m, a more modest 6.5 per cent advance, with sales increasing by
2.8 per cent at Dollars 5.73bn.
However, with accounting-related and restructuring charges excluded, and
gains from asset sales omitted, operating profits would have improved by 13
per cent.
In the final three months of the year alone, Quaker recorded operating
profits of Dollars 180m, down by 15.1 per cent over the previous year.
Sales reached Dollars 1.54bn, little changed from the levels achieved 12
months previously.
The company said that the decline in fourth-quarter operating profits was
largely due to increased advertising and merchandising expenditures across
most of its important product categories.
Quaker also announced that its board had authorised the buy-back of up to 5m
shares. The company recently completed a 3m share buy-back programme,
authorised in January 1993.
