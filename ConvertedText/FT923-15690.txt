FT  01 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Lonrho


Lonrho's interim figures contain fresh evidence of the perplexing rate at
which cash is draining out of the business. While the interim balance sheet
takes in disposals of Pounds 500m, net debt has fallen by only Pounds 192m,
to Pounds 903m. Allowance has to be made for Pounds 126m of off-balance
sheet debt consolidated in the period. But that still implies an underlying
cash outflow of Pounds 182m in the space of six months, which is somewhat
disquieting for a group whose market value is only just over Pounds 500m.
In such a context, the fact that the slashed interim dividend is only 5 per
cent covered by earnings seems almost irrelevant. That is not to say that
the profit and loss account makes cheerful reading. Net profit before
extraordinaries has fallen from Pounds 60m to Pounds 1m. That is struck
after Pounds 12m of property disposals taken above the line. From the
viewpoint of cash flow, it does not help that Pounds 13m of the interest
charge has been capitalised.
The market seemed to take some heart yesterday from Mr Rowland's promise of
much improved profits in the second half. But until it becomes clearer what
is happening to cash flow, there is no point in attempting to value the
shares on a fundamental basis.
