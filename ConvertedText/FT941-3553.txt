FT  16 MAR 94 / German retail sales edge up: Economic Watch


Retail sales in western Germany were 2 per cent higher in January than in
the same month last year. Sales in the whole of Germany were up 3 per cent,
2 per cent higher than in December. The increase was led by a 14 per cent
year-on-year rise in sales of cars and components. Pharmaceuticals sales
were up 11 per cent, and home furnishings 9 per cent. There was a 1 per cent
drop in sales of food, drink and tobacco, and a 4 per cent fall in textiles,
clothing and shoes. Overall economic activity in Germany 'increased
noticeably' around the turn of the year, the economics ministry said. The
ministry cited growing foreign demand, 'lively' housebuilding and 'further
clear progress' in eastern Germany's recovery as factors underlying this
resurgence.
Russia's industrial output rose 2.3 per cent in February from January, but
was 24.1 per cent below the level of a year earlier, the sharpest drop since
start of reforms in 1992. Some 4,280 enterprises shut down some or all
production last month.
Spanish industrial producer prices rose 1.1 per cent in January, compared
with a 0.2 per cent rise in December and 0.8 per cent in January 1993. The
monthly increase brings the rate for the year to 3.6 per cent in January.
