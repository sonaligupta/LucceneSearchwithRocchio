FT  24 AUG 92 / Plans laid to refloat cargo ship


PLANS to refloat a cargo ship driven on to rocks in a storm were being made
yesterday.
The 22 Egyptian crew of the Antigua-registered Sea Reefer were rescued by
lifeboat and two RAF helicopters after the vessel dragged her anchor and
struck rocks near Peterhead harbour, Grampian, on Saturday night. Nobody was
injured.
Aberdeen coastguard said yesterday that a tug was standing by and an attempt
would be made to refloat the 2,800-tonne refrigerated vessel after an
inspection to ensure no oil escape.
