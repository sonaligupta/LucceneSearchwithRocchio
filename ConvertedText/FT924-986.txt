FT  21 DEC 92 / Fears over EC trade law go unresolved


   By ANDREW JACK


PROPOSED simplifications to EC trade regulations due to start next month
remain in doubt in spite of a directive approved last week.
Mr Mike Arnold, a value added tax partner at accountants Price Waterhouse,
warned that a clause in the directive delaying its introduction for another
year might cause chaos.
The directive came in response to 'triangulation', in which a company in one
country uses a sub-contractor in a second country to supply to a customer in
a third EC state.
The directive reduces the red tape required to administer VAT. A company's
intermediary will be able to submit a single customer to account for the
VAT. Under the directive, EC member states will not have to adopt the
necessary laws and procedures to introduce the agreement until January 1994.
Mr Arnold said that, as a result, customers in countries that had not
introduced the legislation during the next year might refuse to account for
the VAT themselves.
