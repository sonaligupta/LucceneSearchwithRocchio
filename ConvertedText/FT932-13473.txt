FT  23 APR 93 / World Trade News: EC sets Czech and Slovak steel limits


   By ANDREW HILL


   BRUSSELS


THE volume of Czech and Slovak steel imported into the EC will be allowed to
rise by about 36 per cent this year, compared with 1991 figures. But EC
tariff-quotas will still lead to a sharp cut in imports compared with 1992.
The European Commission approved on Wednesday a series of tariff quotas on
Czech and Slovak steel imports, as part of wider measures to protect the
struggling EC steel industry.
The quotas are the result of a delicate compromise between Sir Leon Brittan,
trade commissioner, and his colleague Mr Martin Bangemann, responsible for
industry.
Under the compromise, the 1993 increase meets Sir Leon's demands, but
restrictions are tightened in 1994 and 1995, in line with Mr Bangemann's
wishes.
The Community will also treat coils more generously than other products,
allowing imports of 200,000 tonnes in 1995, more than double the 1991
volume.
Imports of other products will be roughly 46 per cent higher next year than
in 1991, and 60 per cent higher in 1995. Above those levels, punitive
tariffs are likely to be imposed.
By 1995, imports of hot rolled strip from the Czech and Slovak republics
will be permitted up to 48,000 tonnes, cut length steel up to 112,000
tonnes, sheets up to 135,000 tonnes and wire rod up to 250,000 tonnes. In
most cases that is still lower than the volumes believed to have been
imported last year.
