FT  16 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Crest Nicholson in Pounds 14.6m land deals


Crest Nicholson has, through its Crest Strategic Projects subsidiary,
entered into transactions totalling Pounds 14.6m on parts of its
landholdings at Swindon, Chippenham and Stowmarket. Each of the sales is in
excess of cost.
The transactions, together with proceeds already received from the Pounds
27.6m sale of four commercial properties announced last month, have
contributed to a significant cut in group bank borrowings, which on October
31 amounted to Pounds 40.5m net.
