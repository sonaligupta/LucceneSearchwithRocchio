FT  21 APR 94 / Nissan profits slashed to Pounds 2m


   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent


Nissan, the Japanese car-maker, suffered a steep fall in profits at its UK
manufacturing operations last year.
The company is set to announce that the net profits of Nissan Motor
Manufacturing UK, the group's Sunderland assembly plant, were between Pounds
1m and Pounds 2m, compared with Pounds 29.3m in 1992 and Pounds 18.4m in
1991.
Output at the plant rose 38 per cent last year to 246,281 cars from 179,000
a year earlier - but Nissan was forced to halve production in the final two
months of the year.
Under the impact of the steep fall in new-car sales in continental European
markets last year, Nissan had to reduce UK production to a one-shift
operation by abandoning the night shift for four months from November.
It has also cut its Sunderland plant workforce by almost 600 jobs to about
4,000 through a voluntary severance package.
Production was cut to reduce excess stock levels, and the need to reduce
inventories further will continue to depress output during 1994.
Production this year is expected to be below the 1993 level and is forecast
to total between 200,000 and 240,000. Nissan said that it expected overall
new-vehicle sales in Europe to grow by between 1 per cent and 2 per cent
this year, and it forecast that its sales in Europe would be unchanged at
about 480,000 following a fall of 8.3 per cent last year.
Mr Ian Gibson, Nissan Motor UK managing director, and manufacturing and
purchasing vice-president of Nissan Europe, said yesterday that the
Sunderland plant was the most efficient car production facility in Europe.
But it had embarked on a three-year programme to match the standards of
Toyota - the best of the Japanese manufacturers in Japan - by 1996.
Mr Gibson said the plan called for increases in productivity at the
Sunderland plant of about 10 per cent a year in each of the next three
years. Productivity had been raised by 10 per cent in 1993. The plant's
total cost performance was already superior to Nissan's domestic Japanese
plants, said Mr Gibson, helped in part by the strong appreciation of the
yen.
Nissan was aiming to improve its efficiency in the UK with assistance from
its suppliers. It has set the target of 25 per cent of its suppliers
reaching a reject performance of 100 parts per million this year and 50 per
cent achieving this target by 1996.
