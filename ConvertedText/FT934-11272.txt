FT  02 NOV 93 / The secret art of disguising tax rises: Emma Tucker explains
what fiscal tricks Kenneth Clarke may have up his sleeve


   By EMMA TUCKER


THERE IS an art to disguising tax increases which the UK government has
started to refine. Tax increases announced in the March Budget amounted to
the equivalent of an extra 7p on the basic rate of income tax, a fact which
escaped the notice of most taxpayers.
So whatever else happens on November 30, an increase in the basic rate from
25p to 26p or more should be ruled out. But that does not mean Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor, cannot raise revenue through higher income tax.
One option, potentially lucrative and harder to interpret than a rise in the
basic rate, is to alter the present system of personal tax allowances.
All taxpayers currently receive a certain part of their income tax-free. For
single taxpayers below the pension age, that personal allowance is Pounds
3,445 a year.
The value of the tax relief that this provides is determined by the
taxpayers' marginal tax rates. So those paying tax at the rate of 40 per
cent receive relief worth Pounds 1,378 - 40 per cent of Pounds 3,445. Bottom
rate taxpayers get only 20 per cent, or Pounds 689.
The Institute for Fiscal Studies has calculated that restricting the
personal allowance to the lowest 20 per cent rate for all taxpayers would
generate revenue of more than Pounds 5bn a year.
Such a move would lead, in effect, to all individual tax bills being
calculated as if the allowance did not exist. The bills would then be
reduced by Pounds 689 - 20 per cent of Pounds 3,445.
People who pay only the bottom rate of tax would thus be no worse off. High
earners would be hit hardest as the threshold at which the top rate of tax
starts to be paid would be reduced. The 40 per cent band now cuts in at
Pounds 27,145 (after the tax-free Pounds 3,445, the next Pounds 2,500 is
taxed at 20 per cent and the next Pounds 21,200 at 25 per cent). With the
allowance restricted to 20 per cent, the top rate of tax would be paid on
any income over Pounds 23,700. But as the institute points out: 'A reform of
this sort would represent a very hefty increase in taxation, especially if
it were to be imposed on top of the tax increases already announced.'
To soften the blow, Mr Clarke could spend some of the revenue raised on
widening the 20 per cent income tax band, due to be widened to Pounds 3,000
in April next year. The institute reckons that half the revenue raised
through restricting allowances to 20 per cent would be enough to widen the
20 per cent tax band to about Pounds 5,250.
Such a move would look good coming from an administration that insists it is
still aiming for a 20p in the pound basic rate of income tax. Even after
doing this, the package would raise more than Pounds 2.5bn.
'If restricting the value of allowances were to be presented as part of a
move towards a 20 per cent standard rate of income tax, then widening the 20
per cent band would add credibility to this claim and would also reduce some
of the cash losses,' the institute said.
More adventurous, and politically easier to sell, would be to 'give back'
some of the Pounds 5.7bn raised by restricting allowances in the form of a
basic rate tax cut.
According to the institute, a cut in the basic rate to 24 per cent from 25
per cent would reduce the additional revenue earned from the restricted
personal allowance scheme to about Pounds 3bn. A more drastic cut - to 23
per cent - would leave only about Pounds 400m net additional revenue.
Whichever way the chancellor chooses to play it, both packages would
generate more revenue than the unpopular decision, announced in the March
Budget, to levy value added tax on domestic fuel, which next financial year
will raise a paltry Pounds 950m. Restricting allowances would also be less
regressive.
The government is unlikely to go as far as restricting the personal
allowance to 20 per cent in this Budget, even with the sweeteners. On top of
the measures announced in March, it would eat heavily into the pay packets
of top-rate taxpayers. A simpler and more palatable option is to freeze the
value of the personal allowance rather than increasing it in line with
inflation. When this happens taxpayers do not see the amount they take home
at the end of the month decrease even though, in real terms, they are worse
off.
According to the institute, freezing allowances, coupled with freezing the
point at which higher-rate tax starts to become payable, would raise an
extra Pounds 670m a year.
'With low inflation this is a relatively inconspicuous and painless way of
raising income for tax,' the institute says.
Tinkering with tax allowances thus offers the government a potentially
lucrative source of revenue. It also has the advantage of being harder to
grasp than a straightforward rise in the basic rate.
As Mr Chris Giles of the institute puts it: 'You would notice the bottom
right hand corner of your pay package go down, but generally you wouldn't
understand why.'
