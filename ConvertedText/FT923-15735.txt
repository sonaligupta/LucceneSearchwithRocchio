FT  01 JUL 92 / State to sell 1,750 factories


   By CHRIS TIGHE


ENGLISH ESTATES, the government's commercial property developer, is to seek
a buyer for 100 industrial estates worth a total of between Pounds 40m and
Pounds 50m.
The agency believes it can find one purchaser for the portfolio, in spite of
the recession. It comprises 1,750 small factories and workshops in northern
England and is the largest single package it has put on the market.
The sale is part of disposals aimed at raising up to Pounds 120m this
financial year to support the agency's development programme.
Although particulars about the 100-estate portfolio will not be available
until next month, English Estates is already receiving inquiries about the
3.15m sq ft of floorspace which produces Pounds 6.5m a year in rental
income.
Rents on the units, 85 per cent of which are occupied, mostly on short-term
tenancy agreements, average less than Pounds 3 a sq ft, but English Estates
says there is scope for growth once the recession ends.
English Estates, set up in 1936 to develop factories in the depressed areas
of England, is now also active outside the assisted areas.
It was told in 1990 to sell its Department of Trade and Industry-funded
assets to generate income.
In 1991-92 it raised Pounds 92m by selling 756 units totalling 5m sq ft.
