FT  12 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Activity in Burton


   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON


Disappointing finals from Burton prompted very heavy turnover in the shares,
which fell 10 3/4 to 66 1/4 p. Analysts downgraded their full-year forecasts
for the stores group as fears abounded that margin pressure will continue to
impact on revenues in the next financial year.
Although the pre-tax profits figure came at the bottom of market
expectations, it was the decline in sales since the year-end in August which
most worried commentators. 'The latest figures show that margins seem to be
under pressure in their core businesses,' said a stores specialist.
Burton blamed the fall on its stores modernisation programme which meant the
closure of a number of sites. However, analysts said this simply underlined
the difficulties facing the group in the short term and was a continuing
factor likely to overhang the shares. Burton launched a Pounds 163m rights
issue last January to cut debt and fund the accel-erated refurbishment
programme. Analysts downgraded to a range of Pounds 43m to Pounds 60m for
1994. By the close turnover came to 49m shares.
Switching out of Shell and into BP drove the latter up 2 to 359 1/2 p on
higher than usual turnover of 10m shares. Other oil issues attracted
intermittent bouts of selling pressure, with Enterprise 4 off at 461p and
Lasmo 2 1/2 easier at 128 1/2 p.
Pict Petroleum featured the small exploration stocks, racing up 9 to an
all-time high of 157p after the market began to pick up hints of a
substantial exploration success in North Sea well 29/2c. Pict has a 17.5 per
cent stake in this well, which optimists think could contain up to 100m
barrels of oil.
Scholes edged up to 173p after the chairman's positive remarks at the agm,
while Molyneux jumped 6 to 71p after the preliminary figures.
Cable and Wireless attracted a series of flurries of strong buying interest,
with numerous UK and overseas funds chasing the shares after the Hong Kong
market moved up to an all-time high point. The stock price settled 10
stronger at 495p on exceptionally heavy volume of 9.6m shares.
Vodafone was bolstered by hints of renewed US demand, finishing 5 1/2 firmer
at 546 1/2 p after keen turnover of 5.7m.
GEC shares were looking decidedly wobbly late in the session after one of
the market's most aggressive marketmakers offered the stock in size. The
close for GEC was 334p, down 7, with 6.1m traded.
Diversified media conglomerate Pearson, which owns the Financial Times,
advanced 16 to 574p after announcing a 63 per cent gain in third-quarter
profits to Pounds 100.6m. The announcement came with details of the Pearson
demerger of Royal Doulton.
The group is to give one Royal Doulton share for every 10 Pearson shares
held. After the figures were given, analysts lifted full-year forecasts to
around Pounds 209m.
Television shares were boosted by growing optimism that the government will
not oppose mergers within the industry. The most likely takeover candidates
are considered to be Anglia, which improved 16 to 415p, LWT, 10 higher at
508p, and Yorkshire Television, up 15 at 206p.
Publisher United Newspapers retreated 12 to 523p on growing nervousness over
the threat that VAT will be imposed on newspapers when the Budget is
announced at the end of November.
Mirror Group Newspapers held firm at 154p as the group said it was
considering a takeover bid for all or part of Irish Press Group.
With Paris closed, there was big turnover in Euro Disney as investors
continued to sell following Wednesday's announcement of huge losses and
financial restructuring require-ments. The shares again tumbled, closing 68
weaker at 368p after an unusually high 258,000 shares traded. The stock has
now fallen 29 per cent in the past two days.
Food manufacturing stocks were mostly resilient to the recent spate of
negative news and comments. Cadbury-Schweppes was lifted by a positive note
from Kleinwort Benson and the shares added 4 1/2 at 470p. Strauss Turnbull
and Hoare Govett were optimistic on prospects for Northern Foods, 6 higher
at 228p.
However, Tate & Lyle, off 6 at 376p, was said to be undermined by cautious
comments from SG Warburg. Unilever was weighed down by nerves and
profit-taking ahead of results due today. The stock dropped 27 to 1103p.
In a dull drinks sector, Allied-Lyons stood out, the shares adding 6 at
552p, with Kleinwort Benson positive.
Cautious comments on Burton's current trading left Storehouse trailing, the
shares losing 9 to 185p.
Worries over the chief executive's post at Lucas Industries were said to
have once again undermined the shares, which finished 3 1/2 cheaper at 173p.
USM-quoted Sherwood Computers came under pressure at the outset of trading,
opening around 25p weaker at 120p and promptly plunging to 90p after
revealing that full-year results will fall below market expectations. By the
close the shares had fallen even further, settling 60 down at 85p, having
touched 83p.
Kewill Systems, on the other hand, was chased higher, closing 11 firmer at
255p, the shares' highest level since they plummeted almost 30 per cent in a
single session in January 1992. Kewill is scheduled to announce interim
figures on November 22.
