FT  26 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Scantronic Holdings reduced to Pounds 2.54m


Scantronic Holdings, the alarms and signalling equipment group, announced
lower pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.54m for the year to March 31. Last time
they were Pounds 3.22m.
Turnover was Pounds 36.1m, against Pounds 42.9m, but the result last time
included Pounds 6m of turnover from Alarm Parts, since sold.
Mr Christopher Brookes, the chairman, said that minimum growth in overall
demand had been experienced but Scantronic had benefited from increased
market share. The north American activities had been helped by the
completion of a rationalisation programme.
For the current year, he said trading profits had been strong in the first
quarter and that the full-year performance should be enhanced by the
contribution of recently-released products, including those from the new
Arrowhead sensor division.
Operating profits fell from Pounds 3.74m - which included Pounds 317,000
from Alarm Parts - to Pounds 2.96m. The pre-tax figure was after a fall in
interest charged to Pounds 422,000 (Pounds 1.79m).
The directors are recommending an unchanged final dividend of 2.185p, which
holds the total at 2.975. Earnings per share fell to 2.18p (3.83p).
There was an extraordinary credit of Pounds 1.03m (Pounds 2.45m).
