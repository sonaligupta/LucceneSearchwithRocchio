FT  22 DEC 92 / Terror attack may affect Greek vote


   By KERIN HOPE


   ATHENS


A TERRORIST attack on a deputy from Greece's ruling New Democracy party has
left the government awkwardly placed for today's parliamentary vote on the
1993 budget, writes Kerin Hope in Athens.
New Democracy in effect lost its one-seat majority in the 300-member chamber
yesterday after Mr Eleftherios Papadimitriou, a backbencher who sat on the
parliamentary budget committee, was shot in the leg by a gunman who stopped
the politician's car in an Athens suburb. Mr Papadimitriou was reported to
be in a stable condition after surgery, but it was not clear whether he
would be able to take part in the vote.
Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, the prime minister, is already under pressure
from prominent deputies who object to his efforts to introduce structural
reform. He has tried to rally New Democracy by claiming the budget debate
amounts to a vote of confidence in his government.
