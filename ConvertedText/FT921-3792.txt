FT  12 MAR 92 / Guy's hospital trust avoids deficit


   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent


MANAGERS at Guy's Hospital, London, have told staff that the trust hospital
will break even this financial year in spite of predictions of a Pounds 2m
deficit.
Guy's and Lewisham, the best-known of the government's first self-governing
trusts established last April, was identified as heading for a Pounds 2m
deficit in a Department of Health memorandum leaked by the Labour party last
month.
Yesterday Mr Peter Griffiths, chief executive, said that the trust would
break even. Staff have been told that in its first year of operation the
Guy's and Lewisham trust will have treated 6,000 more patients than in the
previous 12 months while remaining within its income.
There have been allegations - denied by managers at Guy's - that additional
government money has been channelled to the trust by ministers, who would
find it embarrassing for the most prominent trust hospital to fail to meet
its targets.
During a stormy first year as a trust, expenditure at Guy's was cut by
Pounds 9m, largely through eliminating posts.
Mr Griffiths said Guy's had reduced its overall unit costs by 9 per cent. He
hoped this would enable the trust to remain competitive in the new
contract-based system of funding health care.
While Guy's managers say they hope to avoid further cuts such as this year's
loss of posts, 1992-93 will see the start of a big drive for improved
productivity. London's hospitals face a maintenance backlog of nearly Pounds
450m, according to the King's Fund Commission, a charity concerned with the
development of the health service. It found that the four Thames regional
health authorities faced a maintenance backlog of more than Pounds 900m.
