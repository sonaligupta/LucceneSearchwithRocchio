FT  12 MAR 92 / EC opens new inquiry into BAe 'sweeteners'


   By ANDREW HILL


   STRASBOURG


THE European Commission yesterday opened a new inquiry into the legality of
'sweeteners' paid to British Aerospace by the UK government when the company
bought Rover, the carmaker, in 1988.
Sir Leon Brittan, the EC competition commissioner and a former Conservative
cabinet minister, promised to open a new probe last month after the European
Court of Justice overturned on a technicality the commission's 1990 decision
to order repayment of the Pounds 44.4m of sweeteners. The court said the
commission should have opened a separate investigation to discover whether
the sweetners were illegal state aid. It did not look into the substance of
the case.
Sir Leon's fellow commissioners, meeting in Strasbourg, backed his call for
a full state-aid inquiry. Their decision is set to revive the controversy
surrounding the original BAe/Rover deal - and Sir Leon's reaction to it - at
a time when all British political parties are seeking electoral ammunition.
But commission officials said the election campaign was not a factor in the
timing of the announcement.
The commission said it was 'still of the opinion that the measures taken by
the British government in 1988 constituted illegal state aid'. In spite of
that, the inquiry is unlikely to be completed before the election.
