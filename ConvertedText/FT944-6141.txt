FT  30 NOV 94 / International Company News: Goldman secures fresh equity


   By PATRICK HARVERSON


   NEW YORK


Goldman Sachs, the privately-owned Wall Street investment bank, has secured
Dollars 250m in equity capital from a Hawaiian institution, in a deal that
boosts outside ownership of the firm above 20 per cent for the first time in
its 125-year history.
The injection of fresh capital comes at a crucial time for Goldman. This
year, its earnings have dropped sharply because of unfavourable conditions
in investment banking and trading businesses worldwide.
The bank has also seen a larger-than-normal number of partners retire,
including several senior executives.
The bulk of Goldman's capital comes directly from the pockets of its
partners, so any dilution of its partnership base has serious long-term
implications for the firm.
Goldman, like other Wall Street investment banks and securities houses,
needs a large reservoir of capital to conduct much of its business. Partly
to shore up its capital base, Goldman named a record number of new partners
earlier this year.
The Dollars 250m investment by the Kamehameha Schools/Bishop Estate, a
Hawaiian educational trust, will entitle it to between 4 per cent and 5 per
cent of Goldman's annual profits.
The trust, which was established in 1884 on the death of a Hawaiian
princess, mainly comprises land holdings throughout the Hawaiian islands. It
made a similar investment in Goldman Sachs two years ago.
The Kamehameha deal marks only the fifth time that non-partners have
invested in Goldman, and lifts outside ownership of the firm to 20.5 per
cent from 16.5 per cent.
