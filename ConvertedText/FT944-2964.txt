FT  15 DEC 94 / Bankruptcy ruling a blow to Tapie's political ambitions


   By DAVID BUCHAN


   PARIS


The political career of Mr Bernard Tapie, the French populist radical,
appeared to have been marred last night by a decision of the Paris
commercial court to put personal companies of the former tycoon into
liquidation.
Under French law, people declared bankrupt are banned from holding office
for five years.
Mr Tapie had been mentioned as a leftwing candidate for the presidency to
fill something of the void left after Mr Jacques Delors' decision not to run
as the Socialist candidate. He had also shown every intention of running for
mayor of Marseilles next year. Mr Tapie, who has been fighting a series of
tax, football bribery and corporate investigations by appealing against
every court ruling against him, said last night that he would appeal against
yesterday's decision.
But it is likely to remove any presidential or mayoral hopes he may have
had. It was not clear last night whether the ruling would allow him to
continue as a national deputy and a Euro MP.
The Paris court yesterday ruled that two of Mr Tapie's companies, personally
underwritten by Mr Tapie and his wife, Dominique, should be liquidated
because their 'liabilities far exceeded their assets' - his Paris mansion
and his Marseilles yacht.
A lawyer for Credit Lyonnais, the troubled state bank which has been
pursuing Mr Tapie for the FFr1.2bn (Pounds 142m) he owes it, said the
decision might cost the bank FFr1bn, apparently because the state had first
call on Mr Tapie for unpaid tax.
The ruling blocks Credit Lyonnais' planned auction today of Mr Tapie's
17th-century Paris mansion. Its future will be decided by a court-appointed
liquidator. Mr Tapie still faces other court cases concerning the fate of
his industrial holdings, consisting chiefly of a health food chain and
makers of weighing machines.
