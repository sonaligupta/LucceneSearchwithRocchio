FT  15 JUN 93 / Business and the Law: US patent action poses threat to
computer makers - Legal briefs


Mr Harry Aine, a US inventor and lawyer, has launched a patent petition with
the US International Trade Commission which, according to lawyers defending
the action, could cripple the multi-billion dollar personal computer
industry.
Mr Aine owns a patent taken out in 1987 for a process by which metal disks
for hard disk drives are coated with a protective layer of pure carbon. With
the help of Chicago law firm Kirkland & Ellis, Mr Aine is pursuing 20
foreign and US-based disk and disk-drive manufacturers which he claims are
infringing his patent.
According to the US National Law Journal, the list includes Seagate
Technology and Digital Equipment of the US, and Asahi Komag of Tokyo, but
not International Business Machines which has been licensed by Mr Aine.
In his petition lodged at the end of March, Mr Aine asked the ITC to ban
permanently the entry into the US of all disks, disk drives and computers
that infringe his patent. He told the ITC that an estimated 6.53m infringing
disks were produced a month by non-licensed companies. Under ITC rules the
Commission must rule on the case within one year.
