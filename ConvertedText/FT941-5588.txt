FT  05 MAR 94 / International Company News: James Crean in the black with
IPounds 15.9m


   By TIM COONE


   DUBLIN


A turnround from pre-tax losses of IPounds 15.4m to profits of IPounds 15.9m
(Pounds 15.3m) was announced by James Crean, the Dublin-based industrial
holding company, for the year to December 31.
The 1992 loss was after an exceptional IPounds 32.4m charge for the
write-off of IAS, an aircraft leasing subsidiary. There was an exceptional
IPounds 300,000 charge in 1993 relating to a disposal.
Operating profits dropped by 8 per cent to IPounds 22.2m on turnover up 8
per cent at IPounds 245m.
The company said that competitive market conditions had squeezed margins,
especially its office products division.
However, Mr Brian Molloy, chief operations officer, pointed to the overall
sales growth across the group which he said was indicative of a lifting of
recessionary conditions and should bring 'a sharp upswing in margins' in its
wake.
Net borrowings at the year-end were IPounds 77.8m (IPounds 69.7m). Last
month the group announced a 35-for-100 rights issue, together with a
convertible loan stock issue, to raise a total of IPounds 62.8m before
expenses. This will be used to reduce gearing to 40-50 per cent, leaving
between IPounds 15m and IPounds 25m for acquisitions being sought in the
food sector in the US and electrical wholesaling sector in the UK.
Inishtech, the 70 per cent-owned subsidiary which earlier this week
announced an 11 per cent growth in pre-tax profits to IPounds 8m,
contributed 40 per cent of Crean's profits. Crean has announced its
intention to acquire the remaining 30 per cent of Inishtech through a share
swap, but Inishtech's independent directors have now indicated that they
will seek a cash alternative in any offer. This could absorb a significant
part of the funds being raised for other acquisitions.
Earnings per share, after goodwill amortisation and exceptionals, were 20.6p
(76.1p losses). Unadjusted earnings were 27.4p (29.3p).
A final dividend of 7.865p (4.635p) is recommended for a total of 13.5p
(12.5p).
COMMENT
Crean has seen its turnover almost double in the past five years, but
profits and earnings per share have been declining since 1989 while gearing
has leapt to 83 per cent. Shareholders are now to be called upon to clean up
the balance sheet, through a rights issue at a tempting 20 per cent discount
to the current share price of 325p. Fully diluted earnings of 25p per share
can be expected in 1994, giving a prospective p/e of 13, cheapish for the
sector, but maybe rightly so given performance to date.
