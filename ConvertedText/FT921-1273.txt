FT  25 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Sunset + Vine improves 48%


Sunset + Vine, the television programming and services group, returned to
the growth track with a 48 per cent expansion in interim profits.
On turnover ahead some 31 per cent to Pounds 2.46m, the pre-tax line for the
six months to end-December rose to Pounds 363,000 (Pounds 246,000).
Mr Colin Frewin, chief executive, attributed the performance to efforts made

at the final commissioning stage, he added.
The interim dividend is maintained at 1.5p, payable from earnings of 4.6p
(3p) per share.
