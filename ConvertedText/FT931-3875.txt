FT  13 MAR 93 / Letter: Bill and Hillary, maybe - but not President Chelsea


   From Mr ABDULRAHMAN ABDI


Sir, Michael Thompson-Noel, whose columns I enjoy, quotes himself (Hawks &
Handsaws: 'A word from your clutter buddy,' February 27) as telling
President Clinton: 'You could be in the White House for eight years. After
that, Hillary Rodham Clinton could be president, followed by Chelsea (who
will presumably rule the country from 2008 to 2016). We are talking 2016,
William.'
While it is quite possible that Clinton may get re-elected in 1996 and that
his wife, Hillary, may also run the White House for two terms after he
leaves office, it will be impossible for Chelsea to get elected in 2008]
Why? Because she is only 13 years of age and will be 29 by the time both her
father and her mother served two terms each and left office. And our
constitution does not allow the election of 29-year-olds to the Oval Office.
It says: 'Neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not
have attained the age of 35 years'.
Mr Thompson-Noel, who told us that he paid a visit to California and read
light material (like The New York Times and a Joseph Wambaugh novel) should
have picked up a cheap paperback copy of the US Constitution.
