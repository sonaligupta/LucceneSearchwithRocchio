FT  12 NOV 92 / Warning of threat to 2,000 Navy jobs


THE GOVERNMENT will tomorrow announce the loss of about 2,000 Naval support
jobs and the closure of Portland Naval training base, unions said last
night.
Mr Jack Dromey, general secretary of the TGWU general union, warned that the
unions would resist any attempt to close the base and would call for an
independent inquiry if the government tried to implement the cuts.
The Ministry of Defence last night confirmed an announcement was expected
today about the Dorset base and the future location of operational sea
training.
According to the unions about 1,400 civilian jobs are at risk at Portland
and between 300 and 500 at the Portsmouth Naval Base, with others under
threat elsewhere.
The threat to Portland comes less than two years after it gained a reprieve
from closure.
The base had been in line for closure under the Options for Change review of
the armed forces but it was saved when it was found that the cost of
relocating would exceed the savings.
