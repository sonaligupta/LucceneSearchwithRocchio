FT  30 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: Dealers in Russian trading
initiative


   By RICHARD LAPPER


International debt dealers are to form a trade association as a means of
bringing greater order and stability to the Russian dollar-denominated bond
market.
Their initiative, which is linked to the broader New York-based Emerging
Markets Traders Association, follows recent volatility in the market for
so-called 'Minfin bonds', Dollars 7.9bn of which were issued by Russia's
ministry of finance in May 1993.
'All we are trying to do is make it more investor friendly,' said Mr Peter
Bartlett, vice-president of France's Banque Indosuez, which co-sponsored a
conference on the market earlier this week.
Banque Indosuez, together with other institutions - including two which
co-sponsored the conference, BCEN-Eurobank and the US-based New Alliance
Corp - are backing the trading association.
Daily volumes rose earlier this year to as much as Dollars 100m a day - with
the sharp decline in the rouble in early October leading to a surge in
activity, putting heavy pressure on the trading infrastructure.
More recently volumes have dipped to as little as Dollars 15m a day,
partially reflecting a more general lack of enthusiasm for emerging market
debt.
Mr Bartlett insisted that the market had been workable and efficient but
that it was now necessary to bring greater order by formalising practices.
'High volumes mean that the settlement system began to show signs of
fatigue,' said Mr Bartlett.
Settlement of trades can also be awkward, as unlike many hard currency bonds
issued from emerging economies, the Russian bonds must be held and
transferred within Russia.
