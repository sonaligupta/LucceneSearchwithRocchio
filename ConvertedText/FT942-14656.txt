FT  19 APR 94 / International Capital Markets: Polish Development Bank plans
debut


   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI

The state-owned Polish Development Bank (PDB) is planning an issue of
short-term hard currency bonds through the ING Bank in London, in Poland's
first appearance in the international capital markets.
The PDB sees the Dollars 100m three-year programme as paving the way for the
government's plans to place Dollars 1.5bn worth of bonds abroad once the
country's 43 per cent reduction deal on its Dollars 12.2bn debt with the
London Club of commercial bank creditors is finalised this autumn.
Terms on what is effectively a certificate of deposit programme have yet to
be fixed but the ING says that they will be above Mexican bank yields and
below Brazilian or Argentine bank yields. The CDs are to be issued for
between a week and six months but initially they will be limited to 90 days.
The PDB already has a domestic CD programme in place serving companies
listed on the Warsaw stock exchange.
The bank, which is 91 per cent state owned, is itself planning to apply
later this year for a Warsaw bourse listing coupled with a new share issue
which would boost its capital from its present 1,207.3bn zlotys to 1,407.3bn
zlotys. Last year the PDB reported a 147.9bn zloty net profit on a balance
sheet worth 6,582.2bn zlotys.
