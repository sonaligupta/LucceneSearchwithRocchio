   By REUTER


   WASHINGTON


The IMF approved a Dollars 1.5bn loan for Russia yesterday in a long-awaited
deal that should help pave the way for billions of dollars of additional aid
from the west to its former communist foe. The move by the International
Monetary Fund's board comes after months of difficult negotiations and
represents a vote of confidence in President Boris Yeltsin's government.
