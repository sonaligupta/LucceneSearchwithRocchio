FT  26 MAY 93 / Government Bonds: German bunds rally on better inflation
data

   LONDON, NEW YORK


GERMAN government bonds, which have suffered a sell-off in the wake of
Denmark's vote in favour of the Maastricht Treaty a week ago, sprang back to
life yesterday with a half point rally.
The bounce was prompted mainly by technical factors, dealers said, although
the latest inflation figures also helped sentiment, with the state of North
Rhine-Westphalia reporting a 3.9 per cent rise in prices year-on-year.
The bund future contract opened at 93.86 and reached a high of 94.32, ending
the day at around 94.30. Volume was heavy at 83,000 contracts. The DTB June
Bobl future rose to 98.63 from 98.33.
DETAILS of the French government's new FFr40bn bond depressed long-dated
government debt prices, but short-dated issues remained firm.
The June 10-year future settled at 117.10, down 0.06, while the 10-year OAT
yielded 7.19 per cent against 7.18 per cent at the previous close.
THE Bank of Spain trimmed its key money market rate by 25 basis points to
11.25 per cent at yesterday's auction of central bank certificates, giving a
small lift to bond prices. The 10-year 11.30 per cent bond yielded 10.91 per
cent, against 10.92 per cent on Monday.
UK government bonds traded in a narrow range ahead of today's gilt auction
of Pounds 3bn of 7 3/4 per cent stock due 2006, and ended the day slightly
firmer.
Market participants said the gilt market has held up reasonably well ahead
of the auction, helped by healthy overseas interest. 'We haven't seen the
usual pre-auction setback,' commented Mr John Shepperd, economist at SG
Warburg Securities but there was plenty of speculation about how
well-covered the auction will be.
AFTER posting early gains on news of weak consumer confidence, longer-dated
US Treasuries fell back.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  3/32 at 101
7/16 , yielding 7.006 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was up
1/32 at 99 7/16 to yield 4.163 per cent.
Prices struggled to make ground in the morning, undermined by a rise in gold
prices, and a fall in the dollar, triggered by comments from a Treasury
under-secretary on Japan's trade surplus being cut due to the strong yen.
Although the long end of the market rallied after the Conference Board
announced that its index of consumer confidence fell from 67.6 in April to
61.5 in May, longer-dated securities gradually slipped back as the dollar
moved lower against leading currencies. Comments from Federal Reserve
chairman Mr Alan Greenspan, who spoke positively of the economic outlook,
also contributed to the late declines.
Prices at the short end recovered from early weakness, however, in the wake
of strong demand for the Treasury's Dollars 15.75bn two-year note auction.
JAPANESE government bonds recouped their early losses to end the day higher,
helped by the combination of a favourable auction result, a generous
injection of funds in the money market by the Bank of Japan, and news
reports that the central bank is worried that long-term interest rates are
too high.
Yesterday's auction of new 10-year bonds went better than expected, dealers
said. The new Y800bn bond issue - known as the No 159 JGB - has a coupon of
4.9 per cent and matures in June 1993. The bonds were sold at an average
price of 100.06, corresponding to a yield of 4.891 per cent.
