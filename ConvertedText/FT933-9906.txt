FT  06 AUG 93 / International Company News: New head at Salomon bond arm


   By PATRICK HARVERSON


   NEW YORK


SALOMON Brothers, the Wall Street securities house, announced yesterday that
Mr Dennis Keegan, co-head of its European operations, would be returning to
New York to take over the firm's US bond arbitrage department.
Mr Keegan, who has been with Salomon for 13 years, succeeds Mr Lawrence
Hillibrand, who is due to leave the firm at the end of this year. Salomon
said the two would run the department together for an unspecified
'transition period'.
Mr Keegan has had a previous foray into the highly complex, and highly
profitable, world of bond arbitrage. In 1988, he was appointed joint head of
fixed-income in London with special responsibility for arbitrage trading.
He takes over at a crucial time for Salomon. Several members of its bond
department have left this year, including Mr Eric Rosenfeld, former head of
bond trading.
When Mr Hillibrand announced his decision to leave the firm last month,
analysts expressed concern about the impact of his departure. Salomon's bond
arbitrage group uses complicated formulae to bet large amounts of capital on
discrepancies in the value of different securities, generating millions of
dollars of revenues for the firm. Mr Hillibrand was an extremely successful
trader, earning Dollars 23m in pay and bonuses during 1990 alone.
Salomon said Mr Stephen Posford would become sole head of the its European
operations.
Mr Walid Chammah resigned yesterday as head of fixed-income capital markets
at First Boston to join rival Wall Street investment bank Morgan Stanley. Mr
Chammah is the latest senior executive to leave First Boston, the US arm of
the global investment banking group CS First Boston.
