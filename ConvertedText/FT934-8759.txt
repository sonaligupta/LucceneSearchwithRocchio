FT  13 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Unilever


Unilever's shares have gyrated wildly this year and both the bears and the
bulls found plenty of fresh ammunition in the company's third quarter
results. European operating profits slid 2 per cent. But that represented a
resilient outcome in the face of recession, especially considering that the
poor summer, which led to Europeans licking fewer lollies, may have cost
Unilever some Pounds 20m. In the US it was a mixed bag too. Procter &
Gamble's determined price offensive hit the detergent market but Unilever
made progress selling cosmetics and perfumes, which bodes well for the
critical Christmas period.
Unilever will still do well to remain as robust in the developed world, with
retailers on the rampage and recession plaguing mainland Europe. The real
investment interest concerns Unilever's progress in the rest of the world.
Its results may have been flattered by acquisitions, but double-digit growth
in underlying sales and profits highlighted Unilever's momentum in these
markets. This year, profits from the world outside Europe and North America
may represent more than 20 per cent of the total. With US investors, in
particular, paying hefty premiums for exposure to emerging markets, that
makes it all the more puzzling that Unilever remains on such a sizeable
rating discount to the London and Amsterdam markets.
