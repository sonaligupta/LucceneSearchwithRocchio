FT  28 APR 94 / UK Company News: Tesco seeks bigger share of petrol


   By NEIL BUCKLEY


Tesco is to become the first UK grocery retailer to operate roadside petrol
stations - with convenience stores attached - in an attempt to increase its
share of the petrol market.
The UK's second biggest superstore group has sold petrol for 18 years and
already operates almost 200 stations selling its own-label petrol alongside
its grocery superstores.
It has now acquired its first two stand-alone stations, at Barnes and
Thornton Heath in south-east London.
These trial stations will be relaunched under the Tesco Express name next
month. As well as selling petrol, the stations will include 2,000 sq ft
shops selling a range of everyday items including fresh and frozen foods.
