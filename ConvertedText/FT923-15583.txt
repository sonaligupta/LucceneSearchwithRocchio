FT  01 JUL 92 / Cezanne sketch fetches Pounds 792,000: Saleroom


   By SUSAN MOORE


A PREVIOUSLY unpublished preparatory study of Cezanne's masterpiece 'Les
Grandes Baigneuses' was sold for Pounds 792,000 at Christie's on Monday
night. In a slim offering of 60 lots by the London auction house, drawings
were included in an attempt to maintain consistency of quality if not price.
The top-priced work was Monet's 'Charing Cross Bridge, La Tamise', which was
estimated at between Pounds 2m and Pounds 2.5m. It sold for Pounds 2.145m.
Interest was greatest in the so-called 'signature pieces' - works that
exemplify the best of an artist, with Chagall's exuberant 'La Grande Parade'
finding a a new home for just over Pounds 1m.
A lustrous and richly textured still life by Monticelli sold for Pounds
319,000, and Fantin-Latour's 'Roses', a minor masterpiece, found its sales
target of Pounds 165,000.
Perhaps the greatest surprise of the sale was the failure of a good and
early Dali which was bought in at Pounds 160,000. The sale totalled Pounds
7.986m with 24 per cent bought in.
