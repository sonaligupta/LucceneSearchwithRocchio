FT  23 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: EC aid for Scots/Ulster power link


   By Our Political Staff


SIR Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, told MPs yesterday that
the European Community was prepared to make a contribution toward the cost
of construction of an electricity interconnector under the Irish Sea, which
would provide the first electricity power link between Scotland and the
province.
Last year the go-ahead was given for a gas pipeline from Scotland to Ulster.
Sir Patrick said: 'The European Commission will be contributing 35 per cent
of the costs of the interconnector as it fits in very well with the policy
of trans-European networks.'
He said an interconnector would end the isolation of the Northern Ireland
electricity system and increase security of supply. But he stressed the
go-ahead was subject to planning permission.
Mr William Ross, Ulster Unionist MP for Londonderry East, said it was vital
that Northern Ireland's electricity industry was allowed to compete fairly
via the interconnector in supplying power.
Sir Patrick said it would be advantageous if there was competition
introduced into the supply of electricity to Ulster.
But Labour's Mr George Foulkes (Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley) protested:
'It will bring expensive electricity from Scotland, rather than cheaper
electricity generated in Northern Ireland from lignite, coal and gas.'
Sir Patrick said the claims of lignite would be taken into account.
