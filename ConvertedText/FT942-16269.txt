FT  11 APR 94 / Beijing to freeze vehicle ventures

China will freeze numbers of vehicle assembly plants until 1996 under a new
automotive policy to be announced soon, the official Business Weekly
reported at the weekend.
The policy, sketchy details of which appeared, lays down local-content rules
and sets out a blueprint for the industry's development beyond the year 2000
and appears to close the door, for now, on foreign makers that do not
already have ventures.
Foreign manufacturers assembling vehicles in China include Volkswagen of
Germany, Citroen and Peugeot of France, Chrysler of the US, and Daihatsu,
Suzuki and Fuji Heavy Industries of Japan.
Conspicuous by their absence are the larger Japanese manufacturers,
including Toyota, Nissan, Honda and Mitsubishi. The Japanese were slow to
respond to opportunities in China, preferring to rely on exports.
The moratorium on new plants is aimed at allowing local industry to
consolidate after recent rapid changes, including the entry of foreign
manufacturers.
Local-content rules laid down in the policy call for 40 per cent locally
sourced parts for new ventures, rising to 60 per cent after three years,
according to Business Weekly.
China produced 234,000 cars in 1993 and plans to increase output to 350,000
this year. Imports reached 310,000 units in 1993, but that almost certainly
understates numbers of vehicles entering China by a wide margin, since
smuggling is rife.
At 1 January there were 1.2m passenger cars in China, 70 per cent of which
were imported. China reduced tariffs by 70 per cent from the beginning of
the year to 150 per cent for larger cars and 110 per cent for smaller
models.
Volkswagen is producing 100,000 sedans a year and has increased local
content to 80 per cent. The Germans have plans to introduce new models to
range more widely across the Chinese market.
China is home to about 120 vehicle manufacturers, but many are tiny, turning
out as few as 10 vehicles per week. Such enterprises are struggling to
survive in the new, more competitive era.
Restrictions on numbers of car assembly plants will not apply to components
manufacturers, which are flooding into China in search of opportunities.
Ford and General Motors are establishing components joint ventures in order
to build a platform for entry to the China market once restrictions on new
assembly plants are lifted.
