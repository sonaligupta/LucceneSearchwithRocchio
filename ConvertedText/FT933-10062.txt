FT  06 AUG 93 / US factory orders show rise of 2.6%

   WASHINGTON


ORDERS received by US factories rebounded 2.6 per cent in June, the first
rise in three months and the biggest increase this year, the Commerce
Department reported yesterday.
In another positive report, the US Labour Department yesterday indicated a
decline in the number of workers filing new unemployment claims in the week
ending July 31. Claims fell to a seasonally adjusted 336,000, against
396,000 a week earlier.
In all, new orders for manufactured goods increased Dollars 6.4bn in June,
following a 1.6 per cent drop in May. New orders for the first half of this
year were 6.1 per cent ahead of the equivalent period in 1992. Orders for
defence goods, which have been declining, were up 8.1 per cent, the first
rise since March. Excluding the defence category, orders still rose 2.5 per
cent.
The orders rise was above Wall Street economists' expectations of a 2 per
cent increase.
Transportation equipment provided the largest increase in June, most of it
for aircraft and parts. Excluding transport equipment, new orders for
durable goods increased by only 0.3 per cent.
The rise was more significant in the non-durable goods sector, where orders
rose 1.3 per cent to Dollars 124.1bn for products such as chemicals and
foods.
Shipments of both durable and non-durable goods rose in June, by 2.3 per
cent and 1.3 per cent respectively. However, the number of unfilled orders
declined, particularly for durable goods, which fell to the lowest level
since August 1988.
