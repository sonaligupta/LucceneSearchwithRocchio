FT  26 MAY 93 / 'Travelgate' five get return tickets


   By JUREK MARTIN


IN WHAT appeared to be a humiliating climbdown, the White House last night
reversed the summary dismissal of five of the seven travel staff sacked last
week and ordered an internal investigation into the controversy now known as
'travelgate'.
The five were not restored to their jobs but placed on administrative leave
with full pay pending the investigation. If cleared they would be eligible
for federal employment. The travel office head, Mr Billy Dale, has retired
under the threat of dismissal and his deputy's sacking was confirmed.
Mr George Stephanopoulos, the chief spokesman, conceded that 'we didn't
handle this as well as we would have liked'. He added that Mr Thomas 'Mack'
McLarty, the chief of staff, accepted responsibility for any mistakes and
would personally conduct the internal investigation.
The controversy, reflecting badly on the competence of White House staff,
has made it all the harder for President Bill Clinton to persuade Congress
to pass his budget package, on which the House is due to vote tomorrow.
This incident, combined with the affair of Mr Clinton's Air Force One
haircut last week, has made the president and his staff the butt of
criticism and ridicule on the floor of Congress, in the media and by the
nation's comedians.
Mr Stephanopoulos also admitted the White House was wrong to release an FBI
statement last week implying a criminal investigation into the travel office
was justified on grounds of non-competitive practices and poor accounting.
Ms Janet Reno, attorney-general, has complained the White House approached
the FBI without her knowledge.
