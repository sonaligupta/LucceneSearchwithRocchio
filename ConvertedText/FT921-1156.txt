FT  25 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Mellor's gap - Ballot Box


The Conservatives will have to be more careful with their arithmetic. David
Mellor, the chief secretary to the Treasury, repeated again yesterday the
charge that John Smith's shadow Budget would represent 'the largest ever
increase in taxation' during peacetime. He was wrong.
The Treasury's own figures show that the Pounds 6.8bn which would be raised
in a full year by Mr Smith's plan to abolish the National Insurance ceiling
and introduce a new 50p top rate of income tax is comfortably below the
equivalent increase raised by Sir Geoffrey Howe in his 1981 Budget.
Sir Geoffrey's decision to respond to the 1980-81 recession with a swingeing
cut in public borrowing added Pounds 4.3bn (relative to an indexed tax base)
to revenues. In today's prices that would amount to Pounds 7.9bn. The
Conservatives might recall that Sir Geoffrey's package was judged
subsequently to have been the turning point for the economic success of the
1980s.
