FT  29 JAN 92 / International Company News: Genbel beats mining setback


   By PHILIP GAWITH


GENBEL, the investment arm of South Africa's second largest mining house,
Gencor, overcame declining earnings in its mining and resource-based
investments to lift earnings and dividends by 11 per cent in the six months
to end-December, writes Philip Gawith.
Distributable income rose to R82.3m (Dollars 29.4m) from R74.5m, equivalent
to a rise in earnings per share from 17.1 cents to 19 cents. The dividend
was lifted to 15 cents from 13.5 cents. Gencor has announced its R2bn rights
offer, the largest in the country's history, has been priced at a 14.5 per
cent discount to the market price.
