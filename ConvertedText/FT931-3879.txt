FT  13 MAR 93 / Is the economy showing any flickers of life?: With the
Budget three days away, Financial Times reporters have taken the temperature
of Britain to see whether economic recovery really is under way. There are
some grounds for optimism but a good deal of uncertainty remains


   By MICHAEL CASSELL, NEIL BUCKLEY, JAMES BUXTON, CHRIS TIGHE, IAN
HAMILTON-FAZEY, ROLAND ADBURGHAM, PAUL CHEESERIGHT and GILLIAN TETT


IT IS 17 months since Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, told his party
faithful in Blackpool: 'The green shoots of economic spring are appearing
once again.' One year ago, Mr John Major, the prime minister, assured an
election campaign meeting in Nottingham: 'The recession will end when the
election is over.'
Their premature optimism has haunted them ever since.
Next week, Mr Lamont presents his third Budget and risks derision if he is
bold enough to claim that revival is under way. But, this time, there could
be something in it. A clutch of figures published in the past few days
suggest that the longest recession since the 1930s may be ending.
Housebuilders report sales rising by more than a fifth in the first eight
weeks of the year. Registrations of new cars rose by 16 per cent in
February, though only against the worst monthly sales figure since 1976.
The appetite for buying on credit also appears to be improving, with
consumer borrowing rising in January to three times the level expected.
Some of the latest company results for 1992 have pleasantly surprised the
City and have been accompanied by increasingly optimistic forecasts.
But there have been several false dawns. As Mr Joe Logan, managing director
of Scotsman Publications, says: 'You get green shoots at this time of year.
But you can also get five degrees of frost.'
The brighter his view of underlying economic prospects, the more prepared
the chancellor will be to consider unpopular measures in his attempts to
narrow the widening gap in government finances. The more fragile the economy
remains, the less willing he will be to contemplate any measures capable of
sabotaging recovery.
So as the chancellor fine-tunes his 'make-or-break' Commons statement, the
Financial Times has sought to test the business mood of the nation to see if
recovery is really under way and, if so, to what extent.
The first impressions are of a country which believes the worst really is
over, that the economy has bottomed out. Parts of the north have escaped the
harshest effects of the recession and report improving conditions. Mr Trevor
Furlong, managing director of the port of Liverpool, says: 'We are coming
out the other side.'
In the south, confidence has taken such a battering that signs of limited
improvements in economic activity are treated with scepticism. Throughout
the country, there is nagging uncertainty about what happens next.
Consumer confidence is hailed by politicians and industrialists as the
all-important missing ingredient for recovery. So far, it remains in short
supply. The position is encapsulated by Mr Ian Lawrie, a Nottingham
department store manager: 'Trade is fragile, fickle, undependable but,
tantalisingly, showing little glimpses of improvement.'
Not surprisingly, the outlook for employment - among the last beneficiaries
of revival - remains generally bleak.
Manufacturing industry is slowly regaining its confidence. Express
Engineering, a family-owned engineering business in Gateshead, says some
orders are up three times on a year ago, most of them from UK companies
planning to boost output.
Mr Christopher Moore, managing director of Rigby Maryland, a West Yorkshire
wire manufacturer, reports his 'best January ever' with a good February to
follow. More jobs are to be created.
Profits are another matter: 'Profitability - what's that word?' asks Mr Alan
Armitage of Armitage Engineering in Washington, Tyne and Wear: 'The name of
the game is survival. The nicest thing anybody in accounts could ever say to
me is 'You've broken even'.'
A steady improvement in commercial activity is reflected in the volume of
national telephone traffic. Both fixed and mobile telephone networks point
to more domestic and business calls. There are more new connections and
customers are spending more despite some cuts in charges.
Parts of the packaging industry are seeing signs of an upturn, but it is
difficult to draw conclusions. Moreover, as the industry supplies much of
what it produces to the food industry, it has been cushioned to some extent
from the recession.
Mr John Cobring, marketing manager at United Glass, one of the UK's largest
glass container manufacturers, said sales grew 1 per cent last year. But
after a quiet January, sales in February were up 4 per cent on the previous
February.
The housing market, which heralded the arrival of the recession, is also
expected to lead the economy back to higher ground. Here, there are real
grounds for encouragement.
Residential property markets are increasingly active and, most importantly,
this time the trend appears as though it is being sustained. Builders are
again selling and mortgage lending is rising, though prices may not respond
for a long time. Mr Mike Jackson, chief executive of Birmingham Midshires
Building Society says 'business is on the up', with mortgage offers in early
1993 tripling from a year earlier. Mr Jim Philbin of Norwich and
Peterborough Building Society reports a big upturn in interest which has
'taken us a bit by surprise'.
Britain has been waiting so long for good news, it seems, that it might take
some considerable time for evidence of any lasting upturn to sink in.

gap with London is rapidly reducing. You now have to pay Pounds 12,000

As a supplier of temporary and casual staff we tend to be a lead
indicator, because companies take on temporary staff until they are
completely sure that things are better. Overall we have seen an upturn
since Christmas, but we've been reluctant to say this is a recovery
because of the seasonal factors.

'There has definitely been a big upturn in business. it has taken us a
bit by surprise. It remains to be seen whether this is a blip. We
expect out busiest time will come in the spring. The rise may be partly
due to regional factors - because East Anglia had been hard hit by the
recession, prices had fallen particularly low. People have realised
that there are some almost ridiculous bargains to be had. Buyers are
still cautious, but they are now starting to dip their toe in.'
Jim Philbin, assistant general manager, Norwich and Peterborough
Building Society. Compared to the same period last year, applications
have risen by between about 5 per cent and 6 per cent. January and

Northumbrian Environmental Management, is a waste management subsidiary
of Northumbrian Water. It has two landfill sites in north-east England:
in Northumberland and Tyne and Wear. Volumes were slightly up, by up to
5 per cent, in January and February 1993, against the same months in
1992.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
'We see a slight pick-up, but it's not dramatic and there is no sign of
construction waste increasing. Prices are really under pressure: in
1993 real prices are likely to fall marginally. There is plenty of
capacity and volumes have probably dropped. On the construction side we
don't see any change, there are people quoting substantial price
reductions so the volume of the market has shrunk.'

Traffic on Forth Road Bridge: The number of vehicles crossing the
bridge rose by 5 per cent in 1992 but was almost unchanged at 3.9m in
the three months between November and January.
'We had very bad weather and high winds for much of January, but
February should show a one and half per cent rise.'
Jim McColm at the bridge office

Armitage Engineering, Washington, Tyne and Wear: Founded 23 years ago,
specialises in high specification machining and fabrications. Jan-Feb
1993 order book worse than one year ago.
'There's a shortage of work, people are screwing you pricewise, then
don't pay you in a reasonable period of time. There are so many people
like ourselves, desperate for business, who will go in on a loss leader
basis, on the off chance it will lead to further work. We're like a lot
of lemmings committing suicide. Profitability? What's that word? The
name of the game is survival. The nicest thing anybody in accounts
could ever say to me is: you've broken even.'

Rigby Maryland, wire manufacturer, Liversedge, West Yorkshire: Its
stainless steel wires go into ropes, cables, knitted mesh and welded
mesh. Annual turnover Pounds 8m.
'We have had our best January ever with sales revenue up 16.4 per cent
on last year. February was pretty good too, with an 11 per cent rise.
Over the two months, we did 8 per cent more in tonnes. We exported 40
per cent, but domestic sales are up too. Devaluation of sterling has
helped: the Germans cannot compete on prices, the Japanese have almost
disappeared out of the market, Korean prices are tied to the dollar and
they are struggling. Only the Italians are still in there.'

Tamar Bridge: The southern link between Devon and Cornwall, which
carried 13m vehicles in 1992, carried just one vehicle less in January
and February than in the same months last year.
'Perhaps someone wasn't feeling well that day.'
Severn Bridge between England and South Wales carries up to 17m
vehicles a year, three times the amount when it opened in 1967. The
toll went up to Pounds 3.10 in January. Severn River Crossing took over
the bridge last April
'At times traffic is higher than we anticipated and there are
indications that traffic growth may be returning.'

Steel stockholder -6% SALES *
The position is clouded by an attempt to make price rises stick. Sales
so far this year are about six per cent below the 1992 first quarter,
but have been been on a gentle upward trend since last October, deemed
to be the bottom of the cycle.
'No one expects things to get worse'

Stockholders, Birmingham

Sports Club: Young's Health Studios, Luton, Beds: Membership has fallen
by about 8 per cent compared to the same period last year. However,
profitability has risen by 25 per cent, primarily because of price
increases, and a switch from annual membership to shorter payment
systems.
'People are still spending money at health clubs in the south-east but
they prefer to pay on short-term membership. What worked for health
clubs in the 1980s isn't going to work in the 1990s. People now have
more and more time, but don't want to join a health club for a year
because they don't know if they will be in work for a year.'
