FT  08 NOV 93 / Ukraine missile talks deadlock


   By REUTER


   ODESSA


Ukraine and Russia acknowledged on Saturday making little progress in two
days of talks to settle a dispute on dismantling and disposing of former
Soviet nuclear missiles, Reuter reports from Odessa.
Foreign ministers of the two most powerful former Soviet republics differed
openly on interpreting an agreement signed in September providing for
Ukraine to send nuclear warheads to Russia for destruction.
