FT  27 MAY 93 / International Company News: Loss at Dutch packaging group


   By RONALD VAN DE KROL


KNP BT, the newly-formed Dutch paper, packaging and printing equipment
group, has announced a 'modest' loss for the first quarter of 1993. It said
the downward trend continued into April and May.
The company also announced a reshuffling of its role as a sales agent for
Germany's two biggest manufacturers of printing equipment, MAN Roland and
Heidelberg. This will allow it to meet conditions laid down by the European
Commission when it approved the KNP BT merger earlier this month.
Mr Robert van Oordt, chairman, cautioned that it would not be easy for KNP
BT to post a net operating profit for 1993 as a whole. He said the company
would be taking 'substantial' extraordinary charges this year to pay for an
accelerated programme of reorganisation and integration. It would also be
pursuing cost cuts worth Fl 150m (Dollars 82m).
Another goal is to make unspecified divestments of non-core activities.
As part of a new geographic split, KNP BT is to create two legally-separate
organisations to represent Heidelberg in Europe and Mexico and MAN Roland in
eastern Asia, Australia and New Zealand. To do this, it will be divesting
four subsidiaries with combined turnover of Fl 400mto Fl 500m.
