FT  28 APR 94 / International Company News: CRA warns it may fail to
maintain results

CRA, the Australian mining and resources group in which RTZ of the UK holds
a 49 per cent interest, yesterday warned it was unlikely to match its 1993
operating profit result in the current year.
Mr John Uhrig, chairman, told the annual meeting in Melbourne that 'if metal
prices and currencies remain as they are at present there will be a
substantial reduction in sales revenue in 1994, compared with last year,
making it difficult to come near the 1993 level of profit from operations in
1994'.
Last year, CRA saw sales revenue of ADollars 5.93bn (USDollars 4.17bn) and
an operating profit before tax of ADollars 1.06bn, up from ADollars 730.7m
in the previous year. Mr Uhrig said that, while the year 'had started fairly
strongly,' coal profits had been hit by recent industry-wide stoppages
called to protest at the price agreements reached between the Australian
producers and Japanese buyers.
'The next three quarters will feel the impact of lower prices for iron ore
and coal sold to Japan,' he said.
The company, which has been critical of the Australian federal government's
native title legislation and warned that this would drive exploration
activity overseas, also said that it expected to concentrate around 70 per
cent of its exploration efforts in Australia this year, compared with around
80 per cent last year.
Directors came under fire from an Indonesian representative, who queried the
adequacy of compensation agreements being paid to local residents in project
areas there and the provision of electricity and water to villagers. CRA, he
was told, paid 'what is proper and appropriate for the people, and the
situations they are in'.
