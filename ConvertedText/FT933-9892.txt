FT  06 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei dips as Hong Kong
resumes advance

   TOKYO


SHARE prices tended to slip back as most investors waited for the
inauguration of the new government, which was delayed by the Liberal
Democratic Party's attempts to stall the start of the parliamentary session,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average lost 71.91 to 20,425.64 in quiet trading. The index rose
to the day's high of 20,557.46 in the morning, but retreated on small-lot
selling by investment trusts and public funds, setting a low of 20,376.24 in
the afternoon.
Volume shrank to 230m shares from 301m. Declines outscored rises by 625 to
330, with 195 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks
finished 2.00 easier at 2,227.44. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was a
slight 0.56 firmer at 1,263.95.
The special parliamentary session to name Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, head of
Japan New Party, as prime minister failed to start as scheduled as the LDP
and the coalition parties failed to agree on parliamentary procedures.
Meanwhile, speculation arose of an imminent cut in the official discount
rate, but most investors remained on the sidelines.
Market participants focused on the debut of Taito, a video game maker, on
the second section of the Tokyo stock exchange. The public offering price of
Taito was a record Y7.27m. A lack of sellers pushed the stock up to a bid
price of Y9.2m after an initial trading price of Y9.01m. Investors were
encouraged by Taito's projection of a 65 per cent rise in pre-tax profits
for the current year to March.
Financials were supported by expectations of a discount rate reduction.
Trust banks gained ground, with Sumitomo Trust and Banking adding Y30 at
Y1,420, while insurance companies also strengthened, Tokio Marine & Fire
appreciating Y30 to Y1,340.
In Osaka, the OSE average receded 121.42 to 22,369.95 in volume of 21.8m
shares.
