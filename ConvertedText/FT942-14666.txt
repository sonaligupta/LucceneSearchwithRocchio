Energie-Versorgung Nieder-osterreich (EVN), the Austrian regional energy
utility, yesterday announced a rise in operating profits for the six months
ended in February, with increased sales of electricity, heating and natural
gas to private and industrial customers.
Earnings from ordinary operations amounted to Sch1.28bn (Dollars 106.3m) on
sales totalling Sch6.13bn. The earnings reflected an increase of 7.3 per
cent over the figure for the same period a year earlier.
The improvement was achieved despite a mild winter and pointed to strong
results for the full year, the company said.
The positive results were reflected in a 45 per cent rise in the value of
EVN shares on the Vienna stock exchange, with the price of a share rising to
Sch1,596 in February from Sch1,100 on September 1.
The company has looked to expand its activities in central and eastern
Europe and recently signed co-operation agreements with JMP and JME, two
Brno-based Czech utilities, supplying natural gas and electricity
respectively.
This follows two earlier agreements signed with JCE, a south Bohemian
electricity company, and Degaz, the Hungarian gas supply company.
'These agreements represent a preparatory step in a process which we hope
will lead to EVN taking stakes in one or more of these companies,' said Mr
Rudolf Gruber, EVN chairman.
Last week EVN was awarded a AA+ rating on its senior unsecured long-term
debt by Standard & Poor's, and a Aa3 rating by Moody's.
