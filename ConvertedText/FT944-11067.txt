FT  08 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: No effect on basic rates


   From Mr SIMON SAPPER


Sir, Your article on innovative and performance related pay experiments in
BT ('Telecoms union supports pay test', October 26) may cause some confusion
among your readers in one key respect: I should make it clear that the
remuneration policy relates only to sales commission on top of a guaranteed
100 per cent of existing basic pay rates. There is therefore no substitution
of basic pay for any element of performance related pay in the trial you
refer to.
The National Communications Union and BT have worked extremely closely on
the development of this project in the Nottingham/Derby area which is
designed to improve operational efficiency with a comprehensive package of
measures involving attendance patterns, multi-skilling and remuneration.
We welcome an opportunity to clarify this as we work towards a successful
outcome of this exercise.
Simon Sapper,
assistant secretary,
National Communications Union,
