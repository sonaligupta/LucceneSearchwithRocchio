FT  20 APR 91 / International Company News: Kellogg trades strongly


   By NIKKI TAIT

PROFITS strength shown by Kellogg, the world's largest manufacturer of
ready-to-eat cereals, in the final quarter of 1990 continued into the first
three months of the current year.
Kellogg said yesterday it made profits of Dollars 163.1m in the first
quarter, up by almost 70 per cent from the same period a year earlier. Sales
were 17.6 per cent higher, at Dollars 1.42bn, while earnings per share rose
from 79 cents to Dollars 1.35. This was well towards the top end of
analysts' expectations.
The company attributed the performance partly to the continued strength of
its international business - the element of the business which has been
viewed as fuelling recent growth.
In particular, analysts have suggested there may be scope for margin
improvement on the overseas business. Foreign cereal sales already account
for more than half Kellogg's tonnage.
However, Mr William LaMothe, chairman, also suggested the group was seeing
an improvement in the domestic market.
This has been a weaker area during the past few years, as competitors have
encroached. Mr LaMothe conceded that conditions were still 'extremely
competitive'.
