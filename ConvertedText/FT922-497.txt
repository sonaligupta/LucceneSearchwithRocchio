writedown

BHP, Australia's biggest company, tipped into the red in the final quarter
of last year following a surprise ADollars 312m (Dollars 236m) write-down of
its troubled investment in Foster's Brewing.
The write-down saw BHP's earnings more than halve from ADollars 1.36bn to
ADollars 588.8bn in the year ended May, 1992 on an 11 per cent fall in
turnover to ADollars 14.96bn.
The company declared a final-quarter loss of ADollars 96.9m after the
write-down against a ADollars 223.2m profit previously. The annual dividend
has been held at 40.5 cents a share.
The write-down was received calmly, with BHP shares holding steady at
ADollars 14.34 on Australian stock exchanges. Analysts noted that underlying
earnings, excluding the write-down, were in line with expectations, falling
21 per cent to ADollars 900.8m.
The result confirmed the company's minerals division as its best earner,
with a net profit contribution of ADollars 653.8m, down 21.2 per cent.
The write-down reflects the diminished value of BHP's interest in
International Brewing Investments (IBI), the vehicle which holds a 32 per
cent interest in Foster's Brewing.
