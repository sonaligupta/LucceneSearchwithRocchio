FT  28 JUL 92 / Letter: Need for dose of realism


   From Mr M WHITEWELL


Sir, Ernst & Young's survey, 'Managing in a zero growth economy', appears to
highlight a fatal flaw in business strategy, often replicated by the
government of the day; that of over-optimism ('Owner-managers' optimism
faulted', July 22). Lord Hanson's and Lord White's philosophy of judging the
suitability of an acquisition by assessing the downside risk rather than the
potential benefit has much to commend it.
What we need in the UK is a large dose of realism. Until living standards
are more closely related to achievable gross national product we will
continue to experience economic woes. Clearly we must strive for a fairer
society but this must be based on the foundation of living within our means.
What we most need is a return to commonsense pay levels, property values,
interest rates and the like which are determined by the UK's economic
standing vis a vis that of other countries.
I find it ironic that so many businesses attribute their problems to high
interest rates. High labour costs, low productivity and the cost of
servicing loans obtained for questionable commercial ventures (often secured
against inflated property values) are must more significant.
