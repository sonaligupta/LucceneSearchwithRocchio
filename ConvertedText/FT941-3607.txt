FT  15 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): US investors await week's
economic data


   By FRANK MCGURTY


   NEW YORK


Wall Street
US share prices showed little change yesterday as investors cautiously
awaited a batch of economic news due out later in the week, writes Frank
McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished a slight 0.28 higher at 3,862.98
and the Standard & Poor's 500 edged up 0.95 to 467.39. Secondary markets
fared a little better, the American SE composite adding 2.08 at 468.06 and
the Nasdaq composite 3.60 at 792.80. New York SE volume amounted to 260.2m
shares and rising issues led declines by 1,149 to 943.
After Friday's heady 32-point Dow advance, a sober mood returned to Wall
Street. Investors were facing a series of economic reports over the course
of the week, and the anticipation reinforced a general sense of uncertainty
which has dominated the market since the beginning of February.
February producer price data, due today, and last month's consumer price
index, to be released the following day, were commanding the most attention.
With bond traders expecting the reports to supply further evidence of
accelerating inflation, US Treasury prices weakened and the yield on the
benchmark 30-year issue again crept within strik-ing distance of 7.0 per
cent, a symbolic point of support.
During yesterday's session, the pessimistic scenario on inflation was
reinforced by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. Its February survey of
regional economic conditions showed an unsettling increase in prices paid by
manufacturers in the south-east, a possible harbinger of a broader trend.
The report also indicated strong economic conditions in the region, but on
balance, the likelihood of continued weakness in bonds left equity investors
in a timid mood.
The negative sentiment was most evident in the blue chips, which meandered
within a narrow range of their opening levels during the morning.
Smaller-capitalised issues managed to post modest gains.
The Dow was held back by Walt Disney, down Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 45 7/8
on heavy volume. The stock fell on news of a restructuring plan for its Euro
Disney theme park.
Technology stocks were well represented in the NYSE's most active list.
Digital Equipment advanced Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 32 3/8 after announcing
plans to issue 20m depositary shares priced at Dollars 25 each.
International Business Machines gained Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 57 1/2 ,
while Unisys added Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 16 1/4 on volume of 4.3m shares.
Elsewhere, Federal Express climbed Dollars 3 to Dollars 70 5/8 on news of a
14 per cent rise in delivery volume last month.
Among banking issues, Chemical moved ahead Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 37 3/4
after Mr Judah Kraushaar, an analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York, raised
his rating on the stock to 'buy'. Bankers Trust New York put on Dollars 1
1/4 at Dollars 75 5/8 .
On the Nasdaq, Microsoft was marked up Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 83 7/8 after
the company unveiled new applications software for Apple's Macintosh
computers. Apple was Dollars  7/8 higher at Dollars 38 1/8 .
Canada
Toronto posted a solid gain in fairly heavy trading. The TSE 300 composite
index ended 23.5 stronger at 4,470.4.
Advances outscored declines by 466 to 311. Volume of 75.7m shares was well
below Friday's 95m, while trading value was CDollars 681.7m. Most sectors
were firmer but golds eased.
