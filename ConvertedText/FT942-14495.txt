FT  20 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Free trade challenge cannot be met
with job instability


   From Mr MARIO DUNN


Sir, I am somewhat confused by Martin Wolf's arguments ('A fortress would be
no defence') against Labour protection. He argues for lower levels of
protection so that European workers can 'compete' in a world market, parts
of which employ child labour or adult workers at a fraction of European
labour costs.
I would be surprised if an article in the FT said anything else. Yet can
this be the same Martin Wolf writing in the recent issue of Demos? His
article on unemployment in that magazine states: 'The best possibility,
however, would be to imitate the Japanese . . . The Japanese solution was
the highest rate of formation of physical and human capital in the
industrial world, combined with a labour market that gave new opportunities
to outsiders and job protection to insiders. This is the only route towards
the trio of higher output, higher employment and better jobs.'
