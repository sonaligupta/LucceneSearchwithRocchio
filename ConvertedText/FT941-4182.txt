FT  12 MAR 94 / Capital issues reach record


   By PHILIP COGGAN


Companies announced new capital-raising issues worth Pounds 6.86bn in
February, the highest monthly total since records began in 1986, Philip
Coggan writes.
The figures, published by the Bank of England yesterday, show that companies
are still taking advantage of what, in historic terms, are low bond yields
and high share prices.
Of the total, Pounds 4.92bn was in sterling and of this Pounds 2.1bn was in
the form of ordinary shares.
Actual gross issues in February totalled Pounds 4.84bn. After redemptions of
Pounds 2.01bn, the net figure was Pounds 2.83bn.
New issues have been high since the start of 1993, and the evidence is that
companies are replacing bank loans, accumulated during the recession, with
bond and share issues.
