FT  05 AUG 92 / World Trade News: China leans on Israel to drop Taiwan jet
deal


   By HUGH CARNEGY

CHINA is putting pressure on the Israeli government not to go ahead with a
proposal to sell 40 Kfir fighter aircraft to Taiwan, a deal which could be
worth Dollars 400m (Pounds 210m) to Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI), the
country's main arms-maker.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister, has become involved in intense
discussion within the government over the issue. It pitches Israel's
newly-forged diplomatic relations with Beijing against an important contract
for the biggest state-owned company, which is struggling to restore profit
margins after lapsing into losses in the late 1980s.
IAI has refused to comment on the deal, but is known to have been in
discussion with Taiwan about the Kfir sale for some time. Although a
relatively old aircraft, IAI has the advanced avionic and weapons technology
to make an up-to-date version of the Kfir, originally a copy of the French
Mirage.
China only opened diplomatic relations with Israel earlier this year.
Israeli officials are concerned that going ahead with the Kfir deal could
jeopardise lucrative trade prospects in China which it began to nurture
before official ties were completed.
The agreements establishing diplomatic links included Israel's signature on
a document which in effect acknowledged that Taiwan was a province of China,
not an independent state.
But supporters of the Kfir sale argue that other countries have sold weapons
to Taiwan without damaging their trade with China. The final decision will
rest with Mr Rabin.
