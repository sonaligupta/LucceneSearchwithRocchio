FT  15 DEC 94 / Observer: Tasty profit


Know your beer - a venture capitalist's view. No doubt there are all sorts
of good financial reasons why Phil Goodwin, 3i's man in Manchester, is
putting Pounds 13m of equity into the Pounds 35.5m management buy-out of
Presspart from BTR.
But Goodwin's latest investment has also been guided by his taste buds.
Apparently, Presspart has cracked the secret of how to make the widget which
puts the fizz in beer cans out of metal rather than plastic.
Apart from making it easier to recycle empty cans, the all-metal device
functions at normal draught beer drinking temperatures so imbibers can taste
the hops better. 'I really don't like canned draught beer that's been
over-chilled in the fridge to make the widget work,' opines Goodwin. Nice to
find a venture capitalist who knows about more than champagne.
