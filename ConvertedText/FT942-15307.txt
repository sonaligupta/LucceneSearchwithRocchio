FT  15 APR 94 / International Company News: AEG plans further reshape as
deficit reaches DM1.2bn

AEG, the electrical engineering division of Daimler-Benz, reported 1993 net
losses of DM1.2bn (Dollars 700m), against a profit of DM10m in 1992, and Mr
Georg Stockl, the chief executive, predicted that the company would not
break even until 1995.
Turnover fell by 3 per cent to DM11bn and operating losses totalled DM500m,
compared with DM200m last time.
The company said it had set aside a further DM600m for more restructuring
and is to spend about DM150m on an additional 7,000 redundancies. The
workforce fell by 3 per cent to 58,921 last year.
Mr Stockl said demand in Germany, the company's most important market, had
continued to fall but orders in the first two months of 1993 were 68 per
cent higher than the year before, due largely to an order from the German
Railways for the updated high-speed InterCityExpress II.
None of the company's five divisions made a profit last year. The
microelectronics, railway technology and automation divisions suffered the
heaviest losses. The company said it hoped to merge its auto electronics
unit with another manufacturer.
AEG said it was about to complete the sale of its household appliance
division, which employs 9,000 people, to Electrolux, the Swedish group. The
European Union is expected to rule this year on whether the sale meets
competition requirements, the company said.
The Frankfurt-based company is to be further integrated into Daimler-Benz,
Germany's largest industrial concern. It will take over the diesel engine
operations of the Motoren-und Turbinen-Union, another Daimler subsidiary,
and will be known as AEG Daimler Benz Industrie.
There will be further restructuring until the company is left with 50,000
employees. Most of the redundancies will be in the railway technology
division, the company said.
