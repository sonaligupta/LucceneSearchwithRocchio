FT  22 JUL 93 / UK Company News: NW Water gets 90% take-up for scrip


NORTH West Water, the privatised water company, yesterday said that it had
received elections for its enhanced scrip dividend in respect of some 322m
shares - about 90 per cent of its issued capital.
The company, which is unlikely to have any mainstream corporation tax
liability for some time due to substantial capital allowances, made the move
to help it eliminate unrelieved advance corporation tax. It intends to
direct the money saved to its international business.
The enhanced scrip option was equivalent to a dividend of 21.405p. Swiss
Bank Corporation, which agreed to purchase new shares at a value equivalent
to 20.9769p, yesterday said that shareholders representing about 81m shares
(25 per cent of the elections) had accepted its offer.
The reference price determining the number of new shares issued under the
scheme will be announced next Wednesday.
