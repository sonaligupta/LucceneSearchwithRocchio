FT  06 NOV 93 / Court order in 'scam' inquiry


   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent


THE SECURITIES and Investments Board yesterday obtained a High Court
injunction to prevent Overseas Client Services, a company based in Hong
Kong, from carrying out unauthorised investment business in the UK.
The action arises from an investigation by SIB into the activities of OCS,
Gresham Futures and two individuals, Mr Peter West of Brighton, East Sussex,
and Mr Paul Bingham of Northwood, Middlesex.
Neither the two companies nor the two men are authorised under the Financial
Services Act to conduct investment business.
Asking for the injunction, counsel for SIB Ms Barbara Dohmann QC, said:
'This was a complicated scam where clients believed they were buying options
on recognised exchanges but instead they got bets and mirrors trades. The
scheme operated like a can-opener on their accounts.'
Mr Justice Lindsay, granting the injunction, said there was evidence of a
strong prima facie case that OCS had traded in breach of the Financial
Services Act. Both Mr West and Mr Bingham deny any dishonesty.
The injunction also prevents OCS making misleading statements and concealing
material facts about its operations.
Gresham and Mr West also gave the court undertakings not to conduct
unauthorised investment business or make misleading statements. Mr Bingham
undertook not to make misleading statements or conceal material facts.
