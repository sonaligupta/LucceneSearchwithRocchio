FT  20 APR 94 / US backs fund for green jobs in Third World

   WASHINGTON


The Clinton administration is to provide Dollars 50m (Pounds 34m) in
guarantees for a Dollars 70m fund to direct private capital to environmental
businesses working in developing countries. This is the first of a series of
business-related initiatives for Earth Week.
The guarantees will be issued by the US Overseas Private Investment
Corporation for medium-term notes to be placed by J P Morgan, the investment
bank. The fund will be managed by Global Environmental Emerging Markets
Fund, a limited partnership, which has raised Dollars 20m more.
Mrs Ruth Harkin, Opic president, said the fund could eventually make loans
totalling some Dollars 500m-Dollars 700m. It is a prime example of the kind
of 'public-private' initiatives the administration will support to develop
new technologies and boost exports. It requires private sector companies
also to put their own money at risk.
The environmental fund is the fifth private equity fund Opic has supported.
Two more region-specific funds are to be announced and more are in the
pipeline.
Mr H Jeffrey Leonard, president of Global Environment Management
Corporation, said the growth areas for trade in environmental technology
were clean water and clean energy. 'Rapidly industrialising countries in
Asia, Latin America and eastern Europe need to increase dramatically the
production of electricity to maintain economic growth.'
The US Commerce Department is for the first time taking a big role in Earth
Week activities, which are taking place globally this week and are aimed at
focusing attention on environmental issues. It yesterday briefed journalists
on its work to develop a 'green GDP', a statistical analysis of the
environment as it relates to the economy.
