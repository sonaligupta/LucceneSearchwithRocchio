FT  26 MAY 93 / Miners' co-op in need of Pounds 3m


MONKTONHALL Mineworkers, the miners' co-operative which is leasing a mine
near Edinburgh from British Coal, needs a capital injection of Pounds 3m to
overcome its financial crisis and become viable.
A report by Quayle Munro, the Edinburgh merchant bank, says that Monktonhall
is unable to develop new coalfaces because of lack of finance - due to
initial underfunding and operating losses.
The losses have exceeded the Pounds 1.6m of initial capital, all of which
came in Pounds 10,000 subscriptions from the 160 miners.
