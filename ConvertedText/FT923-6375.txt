FT  25 AUG 92 / Letter: Base tax on public results


   From Mr GEORGE COPEMAN


Sir, The most effective way to minimise the creative accounting described by
Terry Smith in his book, Accounting for Growth, is to charge corporation tax
based on a company's published accounts, as in Germany.
This point was explored by David Waller ('Germans draw line at two sets of
accounts', March 19). The Anglo-American world now has one set of accounts
for investors and another for the tax man.
There would need to be an adjustment period of about five years to change to
a single set of accounts. But a bonus would be more management attention to
real organic growth than to financial engineering.
