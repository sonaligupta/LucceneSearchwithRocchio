FT  29 APR 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Water purification on the move


   By ANDREW FISHER


Clean water is scarce in many remote parts of developing countries. Meaubile
Water Systems, a UK company, has developed a treatment system that can be
put on a truck or left in one place.
The unit, incorporating a filtration and treatment system, can handle some
550 litres an hour, using chlorine dioxide to clean the water as it comes
from the contaminated source. 'Dams have been built, boreholes drilled and
water tanks erected but if the water is tainted or contaminated, disease and
death will follow,' says John Wright, managing director.
Meaubile can also be used by breweries and food and drinks companies.
Wright, seeking funds for production, has spoken to a Thai trading company
about possible local manufacture.
Meaubile: UK, 0283 36715
