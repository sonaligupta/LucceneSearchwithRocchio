FT  25 MAR 92 / International Company News: John Fairfax unveils plans for
25% float

JOHN FAIRFAX, the Australian newspaper group controlled by Mr Conrad Black,
yesterday announced plans to float 25 per cent of its shares. The move is
the last stage of a four-year recovery from a bungled takeover.
Fairfax, which publishes the Sydney Morning Herald, the Australian Financial
Review and other newspapers, said it would float 173.25m shares at ADollars
1.20, capitalising the group at about ADollars 830m (USDollars 633.50).
The flotation comprises 15m new shares and 158.25m clawed back from
institutions which subscribed to an earlier equity raising by Tourang, the
vehicle for Mr Black's acquisition of Fairfax.
Mr Black owns 15 per cent of Fairfax through his Daily Telegraph group in
the UK. Hellman and Friedman, the US investment bank which co-owned Tourang,
owns 5 per cent of the stock.
The institutions which subscribed to the earlier float retain about 55 per
cent of Fairfax, which was put into receivership by its banks in 1990, two
years after Mr Warwick Fairfax bought out other family shareholders in a
highly leveraged takeover.
A prospectus released by Ord Minnett, the firm of stockbrokers, forecast a
net profit of ADollars 57m for the year to June 1993, on revenue of ADollars
782m. The prospectus said pre-tax profits would be ADollars 123m in the
current year, and ADollars 165m in 1992-1993.
