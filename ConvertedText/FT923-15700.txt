FT  01 JUL 92 / Arts: Today's Television


   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY


The new agony aunt chat show series Fighting Back today features former
Wimbledon champion Arthur Ashe who was told at the height of his career that
only open heart surgery could save his life. Then, after two major
operations, he was told he had been infected with Aids via a blood
transfusion (7.30 BBC1).
Radio 3 has a live relay from Covent Garden of the new production of The
Flying Dutchman (7.55) with James Morris in the title role and Julia Varady
(much admired by FT opera critic Max Loppert) as Senta. According to
Loppert, the production goes off with a bang.
A new season of BBC2's filmed single dramas, 'ScreenPlay' begins with The
Countess Alice by Alan Cubitt. Wendy Hiller, 80 this summer, plays a
countess who caused a scandal as a young woman when she married a Prussian
count. Her daughter, played by Zoe Wanamaker, decides that, following the
demolition of the Berlin Wall, she will visit the old family home in
Mecklenburg.
Channel 4's collection of sitcom pilots, Bunch Of Five, has been a pretty
mixed lot. The last of them (10.30) is called 'Miles Better'.
