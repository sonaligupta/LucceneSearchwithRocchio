FT  08 NOV 94 / Monitoring urged for management training


   By RICHARD GOURLAY, Growing Business Correspondent


The Confederation of British Industry yesterday questioned the effectiveness
of government spending in the development of management skills in smaller
companies.
Mr John Parsons, chairman of the CBI's small firms council, said the
government spent Pounds 100m a year supporting programmes aimed at
developing management competence but little was known about whether it
achieved its objective.
He said: 'Evaluation of government schemes for small and medium-sized
enterprises tends to focus on take-up rates and customer satisfaction,
avoiding the difficult but vital task of isolating the actual impact on
business performance.'
Mr Parsons said the Department of Trade and Industry spent Pounds 50m a year
on developing management competence. When pump-priming money and the
management development element of the Investors in People programme was
included government spending in this area came to more than Pounds 100m a
year.
The CBI called for more rigorous research into the effectiveness of
management development programmes, most of which are delivered via training
and enterprise councils and business links organisations.
The call for more focused government spending follows research by Warwick
Business School earlier this year which showed there was no evidence that
management development programmes made companies more successful in terms of
lower failure rates or greater profitability.
