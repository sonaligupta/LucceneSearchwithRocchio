FT  14 APR 94 / Warning to Turkey on Kurds


   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN

Germany yesterday warned the Turkish government against military excesses in
its campaign against Kurdish separatists in south-eastern Turkey, days after
German arms shipments were stopped after parliamentarians said they were
being used against Kurds. 'The Kurdish question can only be solved
peacefully on the basis of an agreement between the Turkish government and
the Kurds,' Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister, told the Bundestag. The
question of German arms shipments to Turkey, which were halted on Friday,
has topped the political agenda in recent days. A similar case, following
delivery of German tanks in April 1992, cost the then defence minister his
job. Mr Kinkel (pictured above, left, with Chancellor Helmut Kohl) said Mr
Hikmet Cetin, Turkish foreign minister, had repeatedly assured him that
German arms were not being used against the Kurds but only for defence of
Turkey's borders with Syria and Iraq.
