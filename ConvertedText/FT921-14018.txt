FT  17 JAN 92 / UK Company News: TVS to sell stake in CBS/MTM studios


   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent


TVS ENTERTAINMENT is selling its 50 per cent interest in the CBS/MTM studios
to the Walt Disney company for Dollars 27m (Pounds 15m) cash.
CBS/MTM is a joint venture between CBS, the US media group, and MTM
Entertainment, the US television production company bought by TVS for
Dollars 320m in 1988. TVS has been badly hurt by the high price and
subsequent poor performance of MTM.
Mr Rudolf Agnew, chairman of TVS, which loses its broadcast franchise for
the south of England at the end of 1992, said: 'We want to continue as an
independent producer. It's early days to know exactly how that will work
out, but as an independent producer we don't need to own our own studios.
This sale is therefore a further attempt to strengthen our balance sheet.'
Mr Agnew pointed out that CBS had a 30-day option to buy TVS's holding in
MTM, though he was not aware of any plans to exercise it.
The 20 studios are spread across a 39-acre site in Los Angeles. They
incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 600,000 in the year ending December 31
1990.
Last November, after learning it was to lose its franchise, TVS decided to
cut its regional programmes by two hours a week - 14 per cent - to the
minimum 12 1/2 hours required. The group's 800 staff are facing a phased
redundancy plan.
At the time, TVS said that its bankers had reaffirmed its bank facilities
until the end of the franchise. TVS has a US facility of about Dollars 95m,
which was organised by Chemical Bank. TVS's indebtedness prior to
yesterday's announcement stood at Pounds 75.8m.
Last December, the compan's application to the High Court for leave to seek
a judicial review of the Independent Television Commission's decision was
turned down on the basis that it waited too long before mounting a
challenge.
The south of England franchise was awarded to Meridian Broadcasting last
October, even though TVS outbid Meridian by more than Pounds 20m.
