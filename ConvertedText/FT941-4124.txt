FT  12 MAR 94 / International Company News: Norsk Hydro to raise NKr5bn by
rights issue

Norsk Hydro, the Norwegian energy and fertilisers group, is raising up to
NKr5bn (Dollars 676m) - some 10 per cent of its stock market value - through
an international rights issue, to strengthen financial flexibility.
Hydro intends to use the proceeds to reduce interest-bearing debt, finance
expansion and invest in new North Sea oil and pipeline projects.
The government has recommended that the state, which holds 51 per cent of
Hydro's share capital, participate with NKr2.6bn to maintain its 51 per cent
stake in the company.
Hydro could conceivably raise NKr600m in the domestic market, where 15.5 per
cent of its share capital is held, and the remaining NKr1.8bn in foreign
markets, where 33.5 per cent of shares are traded.
Mr Jens Stoltenberg, Industry and Energy Minister, said he was confident the
state would win the necessary approval from the Storting (parliament) to
participate in the move. It intended to table a proposal before Easter to
enable the issue to take place in June.
The state's shareholding in Hydro would be reduced to 45 per cent if it did
not acquire new shares.
Proceeds of the issue are to be used to reduce interest-bearing debt from
NKr24bn to between NKr15bn and NKr20bn. Hydro also plans to spend about
NKr8bn annually over the next five years, partly to finance participation in
North Sea oil and pipeline projects.
Expansion opportunities are also being sought in Asia and in downstream
businesses.
Hydro's last rights issue was in 1988, when it raised NKr2.5bn. Since 1988,
the company has invested NKr50bn. Half of this has been related to oil and
gas projects, which have since doubled Hydro's production to around 9.4m
tonnes of oil equivalent in 1993.
Last year, Hydro made a net profit of NKr1.2bn - excluding gains from the
disposal of a stake in Freia Marabou, the Norwegian chocolate producer -
against NKr1.8bn in 1992.
