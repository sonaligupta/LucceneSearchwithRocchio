FT  11 NOV 92 / International Company News: SNC declines to CDollars 2.8m

SNC, the international engineering and construction group, saw earnings fall
to CDollars 2.8m (USDollars 2.2m), or 19 cents a share, in the first nine
months, from CDollars 6.1m, or 51 cents, a year earlier. It attributed the
decline to the North American recession and delays in overseas work.
Revenues were CDollars 492m, against CDollars 370m.
Third-quarter profit was CDollars 2.1m, or 14 cents a share, against
CDollars 2.4m, or 19 cents, on revenues of CDollars 173m, against CDollars
151m.
SNC has cut engineering and administrative staff and will feel the financial
benefits next year. Its manufacturing activities have declined to about 25
per cent of the total business.
It is looking for more international work and has won
engineering-construction contracts in Mexico, Africa, Indonesia and Russia.
