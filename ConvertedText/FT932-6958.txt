FT  26 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Headline in talks and requests share
suspension


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


MR TIM Hely Hutchinson, founder of Headline, the publishing group, is on the
takeover trail.
Headline's shares were suspended at 290p at the company's request. A
statement said it had reached an advanced stage in talks which were expected
to lead to a substantial acquisition.
Dealing in the shares of Headline, which is capitalised at more than Pounds
34m, will recommence after details of the planned acquisition have been sent
to shareholders.
Mr Hely Hutchinson was not available for comment but rumours in the
publishing industry suggested that Hodder and Stoughton was the likely
target.
Mr Philip Attenborough, Hodder's chief executive, was not available
yesterday.
