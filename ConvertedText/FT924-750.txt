FT  22 DEC 92 / International Company News: Siddons Ramset urges bid snub


   By KEVIN BROWN


SIDDONS Ramset, the Australian hardware and fasteners group, yesterday urged
shareholders to reject competing hostile takeover offers from BBA, the UK
toolmaker, and Illinois Tool Works, the US engineering group.
In a formal response to BBA, Siddons said an independent valuation by
Schroders Australia had valued the company's stock at between ADollars 2.60
and ADollars 3, representing a significant premium to both offers.
Mr Roger Flynn, managing director, said the ADollars 1.81 a share offer by
BBA, made through its subsidiary Pacific BBA, was totally inadequate and had
been rejected unanimously by the board.
Mr Flynn said Pacific BBA 'does not appear to be serious about its cash and
paper offer', which has been overbid by a cash offer of ADollars 2 a share
from W. A. Deutsher, an Australian subsidiary of Illinois Tool.
He said Pacific BBA 'must decide soon whether they are up or out'. However,
ITW's offer was below the full value of the company and had been rejected
unanimously by the board.
Schroders estimated Siddons total worth at between ADollars 120m (USDollars
82.7m) and ADollars 139m. Pacific BBA's cash and paper bid values the
company at ADollars 86m. The cash offer from W. A. Deutsher values it at
ADollars 94m.
Schroders forecast that Siddons' sales would increase to ADollars 188m this
year from ADollars 168m in 1991-92, while operating profit after tax but
before abnormals and extraordinaries would rise to ADollars 7.1m from
ADollars 3.2m. Siddons shares closed four cents higher at ADollars 1.96.
