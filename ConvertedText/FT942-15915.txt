FT  13 APR 94 / Lautro fines member Pounds 65,000


   By ALISON SMITH


Lautro, the self-regulating organisation for the life assurance industry,
has fined one of its members - Manulife - Pounds 65,000 after rule breaches
associated with an individual company representative, Alison Smith writes.
Manulife must also pay Lautro's costs of Pounds 35,000, and has undertaken
to ensure that any customer adversely affected will be compensated.
The disciplinary action related to the company's failure to make enough
checks on someone who worked for it as a representative for about 18 months
from January 1991.
The fine is considerably lower than some that Lautro has levied recently,
notably the Pounds 225,000 imposed on Aegon life assurance company and the
Pounds 180,000 on Legal & General.
