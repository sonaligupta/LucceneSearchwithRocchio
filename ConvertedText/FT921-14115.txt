   By REUTER


THE LONDON International Financial Futures Exchange's (Liffe) Italian
Government Bond (BTP) futures and options contracts may now be offered or
sold to customers located in the US, Liffe said, Reuter reports.
The move follows approval by the US Securities and Exchange Commission and
the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
'We now expect a sizeable demand for BTP futures and options contracts to
come from our members' clients located in the US who, up until now, have
been restricted from using the contracts,' Liffe's chief executive, Michael
Jenkins, said.
