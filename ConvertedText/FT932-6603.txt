FT  27 MAY 93 / International Company News: Strong quarter for Bank of
Montreal


   By BERNARD SIMON

BANK of Montreal and Bank of Nova Scotia, Canada's third and fourth-biggest
banks respectively, set the ball rolling on Canadian banks' second-quarter
earnings reports yesterday, with BMO posting the stronger performance.
Its earnings climbed by 21 per cent, but Bank of Nova Scotia's income edged
up only fractionally. BNS suffered a sharp drop in return on shareholders
equity. BMO's earnings rose to CDollars 173m (USDollars 136m), or 63 cents a
share, in the quarter to April 30 from CDollars 143m, or 53 cents, a year
earlier. Return on shareholders equity climbed to 14.2 per cent from 13 per
cent. Loan loss provisions widened to CDollars 163m from CDollars 125m, but
the level of non-performing loans at the end of the quarter was 14 per cent
lower than three months previously.
The bank's loan-loss forecast for 1993 remains at CDollars 650m, up from
CDollars 550m last year.
The stronger second-quarter performance was ascribed to a 7 per cent growth
in loan volumes and the receipt of CDollars 24m before tax from the sale of
non-performing Brazilian bonds.
Bank of Nova Scotia's second-quarter earnings were CDollars 172m, up from
CDollars 171m. Per-share earnings dipped to 71 cents from 75 cents, while
return on equity fell to 14.2 per cent from 16.4 per cent.
