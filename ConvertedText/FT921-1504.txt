FT  24 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Bemrose tops Pounds 5m in difficult market


   By PETER FRANKLIN


BEMROSE Corporation, the printing group, was able to maintain annual profits
and dividends in spite of tough conditions in its markets.
Pre-tax profits for the year to December 28 1991 came to Pounds 5.06m
(Pounds 4.91m) and the final dividend is again 7.45p for an 11.75p total.
Mr Rodger Booth, chief executive, said the result had been achieved despite
an increase in the effective tax rate to 35 per cent against 22 per cent
last time.
In the UK, profitability in the security and promotional printing division
declined amid tough conditions. Worst affected was the advertising calendar
and diary business, said Mr Booth.
However, with a view to a recovery, in July 1991 Bemrose acquired Moments
Calendars for Pounds 1.1m.
Demand for Henry Booth tickets was strong and in May the ticket printing
division of Almex was acquired for Pounds 750,000. Cost savings here had
progressed to plan, Mr Booth said.
ESP, the bar code printing business acquired in November 1990, achieved good
growth in both sales and profits.
During the year GNP Booth and Bemrose Decorative Products were sold to
management teams. There was an extraordinary charge relating to closures and
disposals amounting to Pounds 1.4m.
In the US, with the exception of Janesville Group - the etched crystal
manufacturer - all activities achieved growth.
Group turnover declined to Pounds 48.6m (Pounds 50.6m) while earnings per
share slipped to 19.87p (23.21p). Gearing at the year-end increased to 57
per cent (44 per cent).
