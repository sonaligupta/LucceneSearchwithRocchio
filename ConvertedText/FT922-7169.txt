FT  20 MAY 92 / BA shares rise on 119% growth


   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent


BRITISH AIRWAYS has staged a strong recovery from the worst slump in civil
aviation with pre-tax profits more than doubling in the year to March 31.
The 119 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 285m from Pounds 130m
the previous year sent BA shares 5 per cent higher yesterday.
The company broke even in the fourth quarter compared with a Pounds 210m
loss the year before which included Pounds 120m in exceptional restructuring
charges.
The shares, also boosted by a 20 per cent increase in BA's final dividend,
gained 15p yesterday to close at 302p. The company is increasing the final
dividend to 7.24p against 6.05p in each of the past two years, making 10.18p
for the full year, a rise of 15 per cent.
Lord King, chairman, said the performance was 'highly creditable' given the
impact of the recession and the Gulf crisis on airline travel.
He said BA was in no hurry to forge a partnership with another airline but
emphasised he remained committed to the concept of a global airline.
'Finding a right partner remains high on the agenda,' he said. Merger
negotiations between BA and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines collapsed in February.
BA's performance reflects a recovery in airline operations and the company's
efforts to hold down costs. Although it faced increasing competition at its
London Heathrow hub last year with the arrival of new carriers, Sir Colin
Marshall, chief executive, said BA had managed to gain market share there.
Profits after tax rose 168 per cent to Pounds 255m (compared with Pounds
95m), equivalent to earnings of 35.3p a share against 13.2p last year.
There was also an additional Pounds 140m after-tax extraordinary gain from
the sale of BA's engine overhaul business to General Electric of the US.
Turnover rose 5.8 per cent to Pounds 5.2bn and BA's passenger traffic was up
1.8 per cent.
The company shed 4,560 jobs last year cutting employment to 48,453 people at
the end of March.
Overall costs rose 2.3 per cent to Pounds 4.8bn last year reflecting UK pay
settlements and real increases in airport landing fees and air traffic
control charges.
Capital and reserves grew by Pounds 326m and net borrowings fell by Pounds
53m, giving a seven percentage point improvement in the net debt to capital
ratio at 42 per cent.
Lord King said recession in the company's main markets meant recovery to
more normal trading conditions had not been as swift as hoped. But growth
prospects remained sound.
