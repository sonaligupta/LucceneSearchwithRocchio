FT  15 APR 94 / World Trade News: Cairns Group to remain


   By FRANCES WILLIAMS


The Cairns Group of farm product exporters is to stay in being, to continue
the push for agricultural trade reform, Mr Bob McMullan, Australia's trade
minister, announced in Marrakesh yesterday
The 14-strong group, chaired by Australia, was set up, just before the
Uruguay Round talks began, to lobby for reductions in trade-distorting farm
subsidies. Other members are Canada, New Zealand, Brazil, Chile, Argentina,
Thailand, Uruguay, Colombia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Fiji, Hungary and the
Philippines.
The Uruguay Round deal involves cuts of a third in agricultural export
subsidies and a fifth in domestic farm supports, over six years. Further
negotiations are planned before that period is up to reduce subsidies
further.
US and Canadian ministers failed to resolve a dispute over Canadian wheat
exports to the US. Negotiators said the talks would resume at midday today
in an attempt to reach agreement before an April 22 deadline for US
sanctions.
