FT  02 NOV 93 / Cofan tribe force workers at a Petroecuador site to stop
drilling

   QUITO


ABOUT 50 Indians from the Cofan tribe, armed with spears and shotguns,
forced workers at a Petroecuador site in Ecuador's Amazon forest to stop
drilling last week, in a protest at planned oil exploration, writes Raymond
Colitt from Quito. The Indians later agreed to a temporary resumption of the
exploratory work if Petroecuador's director came to the area for further
negotiations. President Duran Ballen authorised drilling at the well in the
Cuyabeno nature reserve in September. but the work has since been surrounded
by controversy.
