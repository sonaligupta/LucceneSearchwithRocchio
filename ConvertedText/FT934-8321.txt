FT  16 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Renold resumes interim after jump to Pounds
2.4m


   By DAVID BLACKWELL


RENOLD, the chain and gear manufacturer, yesterday resumed interim dividend
payments as pre-tax profits trebled to Pounds 2.4m for the six months to
October 2.
Mr David Cotterill, chief executive, said the company was starting to reap
the benefits of its Pounds 33m capital investment programme between 1989 and
1992.
However, while there was some improvement in UK and US markets, there were
no signs of recovery on the continent. The company, Europe's biggest
chain-maker, would continue to look for higher margins and new business.
The shares rose 9p to 108p yesterday.
Profits were struck on turnover of Pounds 65.4m, up 12 per cent from a
previous Pounds 58.4m, largely reflecting sterling's devaluation. At
constant exchange rates the gain was 2 per cent.
The result also included a Pounds 500,000 charge for redundancies following
a 10 per cent reduction in the German labour force. The company now employs
a total of 2,600 people, down from 4,000 in March 1989.
The chain division, which accounts for 60 per cent of the group's business,
increased profits in the UK. Cost reductions in Germany helped the business
to withstand the severe recession there.
Mr Cotterill said the gears business had 'a horrible year' in 1992-93. The
Milnrow gears business had now returned to profit in the UK.
Holroyd, which makes rotors used in air conditioning and refrigeration, was
'doing very well'.
Net borrowings fell from Pounds 14.7m to Pounds 10.1m, giving gearing of 19
per cent (28 per cent). Interest payable eased to Pounds 800,000 (Pounds
1m).
The tax charge fell from 39 per cent to 21 per cent, reflecting the fact
that much of the profit increase was earned in the UK, where tax losses are
available. Earnings per share more than quadrupled from 0.7p to 2.9p.
The interim dividend of 0.7p compares with last year's total of 1p.
Renold recently raised Pounds 400,000 from the sale of its interests in two
small lossmaking businesses.
