FT  27 JAN 94 / Observer: Papal bull


A Basle reader inquires whether the German central bank will henceforth be
signalling a change in official interest rates with puffs of coloured smoke.
His question is prompted only indirectly by the Bundesbank president's
perceived proximity to God.
The staunchly Catholic Hans Tietmeyer, a former altar boy who once thought
of becoming a priest, has been chosen as one of 40 members of a new
interdenom-inational Academy of Social Sciences - set up by the Pope. The
new seat of learning is an offshoot of the eminent but obscure Pontifical
Academy of Sciences and, like the latter, will meet in a 16th century summer
palace in the Vatican gardens. The idea is to examine global problems with
the benefit of the church's sociological teachings.
Should make a nice break from studying the minutiae of M3.
