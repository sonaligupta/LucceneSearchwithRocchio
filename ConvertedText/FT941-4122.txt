FT  12 MAR 94 / International Company News: Grumman shares soar 18%


   By MARTIN DICKSON


   NEW YORK


Shares in Grumman rose 18 per cent yesterday as Wall Street prepared for a
Dollars 2bn bid battle over the defence contractor between Martin Marietta,
which launched an agreed takeover on Monday, and Northrop, which unveiled a
hostile offer on Thursday night.
Grumman shares, which started the month at Dollars 37 1/2 , soared a further
Dollars 9 7/8 to Dollars 64 3/4 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange
following Northrop's cash offer of Dollars 60 a share, valuing the group at
Dollars 2.04bn.
Mr Peter Aseritis, an analyst at First Boston, said that 'a bidding war
could result in a winning bid that does not make economic sense'.
Martin Marietta said it would respond to Northrop's bid 'in an appropriate
manner at the appropriate time'.
Hostile bids are unusual in the defence sector, and Martin Marietta
complained that 'the attack by Northrop degrades the entire character of the
rational consolidation taking place within the US's national security
industrial base'.
Northrop coupled Thursday's bid with an attack on Grumman's board for
entering into a deal with Martin Marietta, even though Northrop and Grumman
had spent months in late 1993 and early 1994 discussing a friendly merger.
It complained that Grumman had neither informed Northrop it was in
negotiations with another party or invited the company's best bid.
It described as 'improper and illegal' a so-called lock-up agreement, under
which Grumman will pay Martin Marietta Dollars 50m if its offer for the
company is outbid.
