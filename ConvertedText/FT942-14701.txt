FT  19 APR 94 / UK Company News: Acquisition lifts Creston to profit


In the half year to December 31, Creston Land and Estates, the property
concern, achieved a turnround from four years of losses. Pre-tax profits
were Pounds 14,000 against losses of Pounds 57,000.
The result included Pounds 143,000 from the property activities of
Co-ordinated Land and Estates, acquired last June, offset by losses of
Pounds 129,000 on continuing operations.
Mr Ronald Hooker, the chairman, said that the reorganisation of British
Patent Glazing's activities into the Bradford premises had resulted in
substantial cost savings.
Turnover moved ahead to Pounds 2.84m (Pounds 2.4m). Earnings per share were
0.03p (0.25p losses).
