FT  23 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Tiphook


Trying to put a fair value on Tiphook's shares is one of the market's more
esoteric diversions. Following its poor annual results, British investors
have shunned the shares, driving the price down to a point where they yield
more than 12 per cent. The London market harbours an innate suspicion of
companies which support Pounds 1bn of debt on shareholders' funds only
one-fifth that level and have an unhappy history of haemorrhaging cash.
Yet tastes clearly differ in the US where Tiphook has developed something of
a fan club. The televised ruminations of a US fund manager  - and
substantial shareholder - about a possible bid sparked a surge of interest
in Tiphook's ADRs. Tiphook's denial that it was in any takeover talks failed
to damp investors' ardour. Its shares closed 24 per cent higher yesterday.
Of course, Tiphook could become a bid target; GE Capital recently bought its
rival TIP Europe. Nevertheless, the hope seems a tenuous thread by which to
suspend such a heavy weight of financial worries. Tiphook must be fervently
praying that last night's telephone conference with 500 US investors does
not have the same effect on its share price as its recent talks with UK
analysts.
