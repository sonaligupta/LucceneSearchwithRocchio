FT  08 JUN 92 / Major urged to head off BCCI litigation


   By ANDREW JACK


MR KEITH VAZ, the Labour MP, yesterday urged the prime minister to intervene
in negotiations between the shareholders and creditors in the collapsed Bank
of Credit and Commerce International to prevent lengthy litigation.
His plea comes in advance of consideration today in the High Court of the
liquidation plan prepared for BCCI by Touche Ross, the accountancy firm,
which includes compensation of Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 926m) to creditors.
The creditors adjourned a previous hearing to seek 'clarification' of the
settlement announced in February by Touche Ross and already approved by the
government of Abu Dhabi, the bank's majority shareholder. Creditors
criticised the size of the settlement and have threatened to take the risk
of suing for higher returns rather than accept it.
Mr Vaz would like the High Court hearing adjourned. He called on Mr John
Major to establish a panel to recover further assets from the bank and to
assemble compensation measures including pensions for the 1,200 BCCI staff.
'If the creditors sue, it will be disastrous and put back any compensation
agreement for years,' he said.
