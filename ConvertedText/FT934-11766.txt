FT  29 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Ramco improves to Pounds 297,000


PROFITS OF Ramco Oil Services improved from Pounds 250,000 to Pounds 297,000
pre- tax over the six months to June 30. Turnover slipped by Pounds 300,000
to Pounds 2.57m.
Directors of the USM-quoted energy services group said there were
contrasting performances from the operating companies.
'Excellent' figures from the Ramco Alnas associate were partly offset by
weaker results from the tubular services activities overseas, in particular
the pipeline business.
They added that the tubular services arm was to relocate to new premises at
Badentoy, which they believed would improve its competitive position in the
UK.
Associates contributed Pounds 143,000 (took Pounds 11,000) to first half
profits. Earnings per share emerged at 1.27p (0.95p).
The shares dipped 5p to 150p.
