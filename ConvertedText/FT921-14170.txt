FT  17 JAN 92 / Letter: 'Open season' attack is no cure for pensions ills,
while new structure is logical answer to abuses


   From Mr RICHARD CLARK


Sir, John Plender asks whether it is moral for employers to take holidays on
pension contributions and avers that the practice is not illegal. Maybe it
should be made illegal. Pensions have recently been defined in the courts as
deferred pay, and are therefore employees' property, effectively held on
trust by employers.
Perhaps the way to remove the opportunity for the abuse of company pension
funds is to do away with them altogether. Employees could be encouraged to
have personal pensions which would be fully transportable, and employers
would be obliged to contribute at a rate to be fixed and agreed. The
pensions would be provided by institutions such as the existing life houses
which clearly decide on merit where to invest the funds; any 'surpluses'
become bonuses.
This may seem revolutionary, but one only has to ask 'whose pension is it
anyway?' and the logic becomes increasingly attractive.
