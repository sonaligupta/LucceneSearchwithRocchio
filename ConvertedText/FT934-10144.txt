FT  06 NOV 93 / How to Spend It: The National Trust Gift Catalogue


The National Trust Gift Catalogue, National Trust Enterprise, PO Box 101,
Melksham, Wiltshire SN12 8EA. Catalogue free. Tel: 0272-244725.
The catalogue for the home-loving set. Nothing very trendy or high-tech here
 -instead there is lots of charm and endless pretty things for the house,
from the Stourhead Temple Teapot photographed left (Pounds 18.95) to
potpourri dishes, cache-pots, candles and candlesticks. There is a good
section for the gardening set - aprons with pockets (Pounds 14.75), shed
tidies with pockets (Pounds 14.95) as well as tapestry kits, soaps and
lotions and the NT's own collection of foods. For the outdoor life look out
for a collection of folksy knitwear - if your taste runs to sweaters with
sheep or ducks, this is the catalogue for you.
