FT  21 NOV 92 / Slight rise in optimism recorded


   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff


OPTIMISM about the economy crept higher yesterday as share prices rose to
within a few points of their all-time high and a survey suggested that fewer
people felt gloomy about the economy in general.
A survey of consumer confidence by Gallup, the market research company,
between November 5 and 17 found that the Autumn Statement last week appeared
to have had a positive influence on people's expectations.
Pessimists continued to outweigh optimists about the general state of the
economy but Gallup said there was now a greater tendency to expect an
improvement than there was a month ago.
Other results were less promising. In particular, the number of people
expecting unemployment to increase reached its highest ever level. Four out
of five people expect unemployment to increase over the next 12 months.
The survey concluded a week of conflicting evidence on the state of the UK
economy.
Better-than-expected retail sales figures and an increase in bank lending
last month added to the bullish sentiment on the stock market yesterday.
Other official figures this week showed that output of the economy,
excluding oil and gas extraction, fell in the three months to September,
dragging the recession into its ninth quarter.
