FT  12 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Abbeycrest declines to Pounds 1.35m


ABBEYCREST, the UK's biggest manufacturer of gold and silver jewellery, saw
profits before tax for 1992 dive 60 per cent, from Pounds 3.35m to Pounds
1.35m.
The outcome, however, was slightly ahead of analysts' expectations and the
shares firmed 6p to 70p.
Turnover declined 26 per cent to Pounds 44.5m (Pounds 60m), largely because
sales to its one-time largest customer, believed to be Ratners, fell by
Pounds 19.6m.
Operating margins fell from 7.2 per cent to 3.2 per cent, with operating
profits down to Pounds 1.75m (Pounds 4.32m). Net interest payments fell to
Pounds 399,000 (Pounds 967,000).
Gearing has been reduced to 7 per cent (52 per cent). Ms Michele Delmain,
analyst with Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said: 'The company's gearing very much
depends on when they get paid. The figure shows they were out there very
effectively collecting their receivables.' She estimated average gearing
over the current year would be about 30 per cent.
A final dividend of 2p is proposed for an unchanged total of 3.2p. Earnings
per share were 3.8p (9.8p).
