FT  21 JUL 94 / International Company News: German bank takes over Swiss
firm


   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES


   FRANKFURT


Bayerische Vereinsbank is to take complete control of Bank von Ernst, an old
Swiss firm specialising in private business.
It will take over the 50 per cent it does not own from the
Creditanstalt-Verein in Vienna, subject to approval by the relevant
authorities, the bank said yesterday.
Bank von Ernst, with a balance sheet total of SFr1.7bn (Dollars 1.2bn), has
branches in Bern, Zurich, Geneva and London, and employs 250 people.
It has representative bureaux in Frankfurt, Tokyo, Miami and Caracas.
Bayerische Vereinsbank said it intended to strengthen Bank von Ernst's
business with institutional clients, especially in asset management and
capital markets business.
Detailed terms were not disclosed, although the Viennese partner in the deal
is to take over Bayerische Vereinsbank's minority holdings in two Austrian
banks.
Since Bayerische Vereinsbank's 1992 purchase of the Schoellerbank had given
it full coverage of the Austrian market, its 4.7 per cent in the Bank fur
Oberosterreich und Salzburg, and a similar stake in the Bank fur Tirol and
Vorarlberg were no longer of any strategic importance, Bayerische
Vereinsbank said.
