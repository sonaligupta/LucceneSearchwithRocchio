FT  07 JAN 94 / Whitehall 'spends up to Pounds 900m on advice'


   By ROLAND RUDD


Consultancy work used by government departments could be worth up to Pounds
900m a year, according to Whitehall officials.
The significant growth in the use of outside consultants by ministers has
prompted a wide-ranging scrutiny of the government's use of external
consultants.
Ministers believe departments spend anywhere between Pounds 100m and Pounds
900m a year on consultancy work.
Sir Peter Levene, the prime minister's adviser on efficiency, who yesterday
announced the review, said: 'We need to define precisely what we mean about
consultancies so that the same criteria are used by each department.'
The Cabinet Office's efficiency unit will then be able to estimate for the
first time what the government is spending on management consultants,
merchant banks and accountants.
The unit has established a team of civil servants from five departments to
work on a report which it plans to publish by the middle of the year.
Whitehall officials said the government would be looking at why departments
often take on expensive consultancies staffed by former civil servants.
'Those same civil servants cost the government a fraction of what they
charge when they move into the private sector,' said one official.
The review will be examining processes for hiring and managing of
consultants.
