FT  29 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Bullish factors propel Dow to
all-time high

Wall Street
US SHARE prices soared to new record highs yesterday, spurred by good
economic news, strong quarterly earnings and heavy program buying, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 23.20 stronger at an all-time
closing peak of 3,687.86, but below its high for the day of just over 3,700.
The Standard & Poor's 500 gained 3.12 at 467.73, while the American SE
composite ended 2.29 ahead at 477.35 and the Nasdaq composite up 1.61 at
773.49. New York SE volume totalled 301m shares.
The tone was positive from the start after investors and analysts responded
to the news that gross domestic product climbed by 2.8 per cent in the third
quarter.
Although the increase was in line with expectations, what cheered the
markets was the fact that GDP would have risen by 3.4 per cent in the
quarter if it had not been for the impact of crop losses incurred during the
summer floods in the mid-western states.
There was other good economic news in the form of a decline of 4,000 in
weekly jobless claims. Yet it was the GDP data that initiated much of the
buying, coming on the heels of a string of recent figures showing a gradual
improvement in the economy.
These signs, allied with some good third-quarter corporate results, have
been behind the record-breaking surge in stock prices over the past few
weeks. Yesterday's gains were boosted by a round of mid-morning computerised
buy programs, which at one stage lifted the Dow above 3,700 for the first
time ever.
Eastman Kodak was the star of the day, forging ahead Dollars 4 7/8 to
Dollars 63 5/8 in volume of 8.2m shares as investors celebrated the
appointment on Wednesday night of Mr George Fisher as the group's new
chairman.
Mr Fisher was previously chairman of Motorola, where he earned a reputation
as a highly successful manager. The news left Motorola down Dollars 1 3/8 at
Dollars 104 1/4 .
Xerox jumped Dollars 5 3/4 to Dollars 76 3/8 after reporting third-quarter
earnings of Dollars 1.28 a share, up from Dollars 1.07 a year earlier.
General Motors climbed Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 49 in volume of 5.5m shares
after the group revealed a narrowing in its third-quarter loss to 49 cents a
share, down from the Dollars 1.86 a share shortfall incurred a year ago.
Also sharply higher were Chrysler, up Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 57, and Ford,
ahead Dollars 2 7/8 at Dollars 63 1/8 .
Airline issues were in demand, with UAL advancing Dollars 6 1/4 to Dollars
153 and Delta Dollars 1 to Dollars 58 1/4 , both lifted by news of improved
quarterly earnings.
Canada
TORONTO was driven higher in heavy trading by good third-quarter earnings
reports and the strong performance on Wall Street.
The TSE 300 index finished 37.8 ahead at 4,235.2, marking the first time it
has closed above the 4,200-point plateau. Advancing issues outnumbered
declines by 516 to 294. Volume came to 70.4m shares.
Thirteen of the 14 sub-indices rose, led by the real estate group, up 2.8
per cent. Transportation gained 1.9 per cent and mining also 1.9 per cent.
