FT  14 APR 94 / UK Company News: IAWS improves to IPounds 2m


Profits of IAWS Group, the Dublin-based food and agricultural company, rose
from IPounds 1.19m to IPounds 2.03m (Pounds 1.96m) pre-tax for the half year
ended January 31.
An improvement in turnover to IPounds 218.2m (IPounds 176.2m) reflected
stronger dollar and sterling exchange rates and a full contribution from UK
acquisitions in fertiliser and fish meal.
Earnings emerged at 1.47p (0.93p) and the interim dividend is lifted to
1.15p (1p).
Trading in the second half, the more important period, continues
'satisfactorily'.
