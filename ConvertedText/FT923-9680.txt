FT  04 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Benson resumes dividends


BENSON GROUP, the acquisitive Midlands-based engineer, returned profits of
Pounds 915,000 pre-tax for the year to May 31, a strong improvement over the
previous year's Pounds 142,000.
Turnover rose from Pounds 10.2m to Pounds 12.56m and margins at the trading
level more than doubled to 8.8 per cent. As foreshadowed in February,
dividends are being restored via a 0.1p payment. Earnings emerged at 1.09p
(0.39p).
The five acquisitions made during the year have been fully integrated and
each made a positive contribution to profits. One-third of group products
were now sold overseas.
Year-end gearing was reduced from 70 per cent to 30 per cent.
