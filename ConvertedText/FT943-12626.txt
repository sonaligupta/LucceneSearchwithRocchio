FT  23 JUL 94 / Briefcase Q&A: Incompetent solicitors


My wife and I bought our main residence in Billericay, Essex, in November
1987 for Pounds 210,000. As our main residence it is, of course, exempt from
capital gains tax.
In April 1993, we purchased a flat in London. It is our understanding that,
within two years of the second purchase, we must declare which of these
properties will be our main residence for CGT exemption purposes. If we opt
for the London flat, can we index-link the price of the Billericay house
from the date of purchase in 1987, or does the indexation apply from April
1993 only?
Also, would we need to have the house valued at that time if indexation is
applicable from April 1993?
Your solicitors - who appear to be incompetent - should have suggested that,
at the very least, you ask your tax office for CGT4, the free explanatory
pamphlet for owner-occupiers. You should now do just that.
You will see from the CGT4 that indexation on both properties runs from
their respective purchase contract dates; thus, the value of the Billericay
house in April 1993 is irrelevant.
