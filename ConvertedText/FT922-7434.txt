FT  19 MAY 92 / Asda sheds 500 jobs in store management


   By JOHN THORNHILL


ASDA, the troubled grocery chain, has declared 500 management jobs redundant
at its 206 stores.
The Leeds-based company plans to limit job losses by redeploying some staff.
The move follows the loss of 350 jobs at Asda's headquarters in January.
Asda, the Yorkshire area's biggest employer, said the latest job cuts
reflected the cost benefits from the company's investment in a centralised
distribution network.
Mr Paul Dowling, corporate affairs director, said: 'Part of the saving is a
reduction in the number of people directly employed in goods reception in
our medium and large stores.
'Elsewhere, we have changed the nature of the managers' tasks. There is . .
. greater concentration on dealing with customers.'
On average, each Asda store employs about 20 managers in a variety of
functions. The affected staff were seen yesterday by their store managers
and offered alternative employment where possible.
The company said the annual savings would amount to the 'single-figure
millions'.
Retail analysts expect a sharp fall in profits before tax and exceptional
items.
