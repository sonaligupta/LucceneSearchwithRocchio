FT  19 APR 91 / Minister to see pension managers


   By ERIC SHORT


MR TONY NEWTON, social security secretary, has agreed to meet
representatives of 18 of Britain's largest employers on Wednesday to discuss
equal state pension ages for men and women, writes Eric Short.
The pensions managers, who had written to Mr Newton calling for action on
equalisation, met last night in Torquay, where they are attending the annual
conference of the National Association of Pension Funds.
Occupational pension schemes are required to equalise pension ages for men
and women after last year's Barber judgment in the European Court. This
judgment has resulted in confusion for company schemes as their
administrators endeavour to equalise benefits within a framework of unequal
state pension ages.
The pension managers, whose spokesman is Mr Michael Swift, head of the ICI
pensions department, believed the quick results needed could be achieved
only by a direct approach to the government.
The independent initiative by the leading companies is seen as something of
an embarrassment for the association, which has adopted a lower profile in
seeking government action.
Mr Peter Stirrup, the departing NAPF chairman, told the conference yesterday
that the association was continuing to present its case on equal pension
ages and the Barber judgment at Westminster and in Brussels.
