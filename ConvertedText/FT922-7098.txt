FT  20 MAY 92 / President defies premier


   By NICHOLAS DENTON


HUNGARY'S president, citing a danger to 'democratic order' in the country,
yesterday confronted the government on its attempts to exercise control of
the media.
Mr Arpad Goncz, the president and a member of the Liberal opposition, said
he was refusing to carry out the prime minister's recommendation to sack the
head of the state-owned radio.
He referred to the danger of 'serious damage to the democratic operation of
the state,' a claim rejected by the government, setting the scene for a
constitutional stand-off.
Mr Jozsef Antall, the conservative premier has made it plain he sees the
radio station as hostile to the party's interests. Yesterday he responded
with a prickly defence of his government's policy, saying: 'poor relations
with the press are due to the fact that I have high standards for the
media.'
It was the latest and most dramatic episode in a struggle between government
and opposition for influence over the media which has dominated domestic
politics since free elections in 1990.
