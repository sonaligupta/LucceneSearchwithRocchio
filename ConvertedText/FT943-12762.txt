FT  22 JUL 94 / International Company News: BBV expands despite 14% decline

Banco Bilbao Vizcaya plans to spend Pta15bn (Dollars 116m) opening 250 urban
bank branches in Spain before the end of next year despite a 14 per cent
first-half fall in its net consolidated profit.
The expansion, which will lift the group's network to nearly 3,000 branches,
indicates BBV's ambitions to keep a strong share of the domestic deposit
base despite its failure to outbid Banco Santander in the auction for
Banesto, the fourth-ranked Spanish bank, last April.
BBV's six-month profit fall to Pta38.3bn was blamed on exceptional bond
market losses that analysts estimated could have touched Pta50bn. The
group's core banking business, in contrast, showed a healthy 6.2 per cent
rise to Pta220.9bn in its net interest margin.
Spending restraints which kept personnel costs to a rise of 0.8 per cent and
brought overall expenditure down by 0.3 per cent allowed the group to
increase its operating income by 18 per cent to Pta87.3bn.
BBV expects to recover part of its debt market losses, and also loan
provisions, in the second half of this year and is confident that it will
post similar year-end results to 1993 when its net profits rose by 2.3 per
cent to Pta71bn.
