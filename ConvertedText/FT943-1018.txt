FT  27 SEP 94 / Parliament ousts Estonian premier

Estonia's prime minister, Mr Mart Laar, was swept from office yesterday in a
vote of no-confidence. After an emotional two-hour debate in which Mr Laar
was accused of repeatedly lying to the people, deputies voted by 60-27, with
one abstention, for the radical pro-marketeer to leave office. 'The
credibility of the prime minister has sunk below the critical line,' said Mr
Jaan Kaplinski of the opposition Centrist party.
Deputies accused Mr Laar, a member of the conservative Fatherland party who
has held office since October 1992, of destroying public confidence by
deceit, high-handedness and promoting secrecy in government. Mr Laar had won
the backing of western financial organisations with a tough line on spending
and budget policies. He will remain in office until a new candidate is
chosen in talks among parliamentary parties in the next few days. Deputies
made clear that pro-market reform policies would be unchanged.
