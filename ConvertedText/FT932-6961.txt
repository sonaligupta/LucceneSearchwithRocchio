FT  26 MAY 93 / UK Company News: PhoneLink checks into USM


   By ALAN CANE


THE UNLISTED Securities Market yesterday gained its first recruit since its
reprieve from closure when PhoneLink, a Birkenhead-based computing services
company, placed 8.9m shares at 155p a share, valuing it at Pounds 55m.
Now three years old, PhoneLink has developed a novel technique for
extracting information from commercial computer databases quickly and
economically. Mr John Lyon, commercial director, said the decision to go to
the USM had been made because the company could not yet meet the financial
criteria for a listing.
The placing, by Allied Provincial, of about 25 per cent of the equity raised
Pounds 9.9m net of expenses. The shares were placed with a group of
institutions each of which now holds less than 3 per cent of the total. Mr
Trevor Burke, PhoneLink's founder and chief executive and his wife Heather,
client services director, will each receive Pounds 1.3m as a result of the
flotation. Mr Burke retains a 52.5 per cent interest in the company.
PhoneLink intends to use the funds raised to improve the company's
Birkenhead site and to buy a second production site. It estimates this will
cost Pounds 5.1m. Some Pounds 600,000 will be spent on developing existing
business and the rest will be used to promote and market Tel-Me, the
company's flagship product which will be launched in the first quarter of
1994. In the year to March 31 PhoneLink's turnover amounted to Pounds
923,000. Pre-tax profit was Pounds 31,000 after writing off development
expenditure of Pounds 414,000.
PhoneLink's revenues to date come from Datacare, a service based on its
information retrieval software used for the automated bulk retrieval of
telephone numbers by banks and utilities among others.
A second application will be BT Teledirectory which will enable BT customers
to obtain telephone numbers from a personal computer attached to PhoneLink's
system.
Dealing in the shares begin on June 1.
