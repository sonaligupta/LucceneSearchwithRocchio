FT  13 APR 92 / Najibullah to hand over power to neutral council


   By REUTER


   ISLAMABAD


PRESIDENT Najibullah's Afghan government at the weekend accepted a plan to
hand over power to a neutral council and end 13 years of civil war, Reuter
reports from Islamabad.
Mr Abdul Wakil, foreign minister, was quoted by the official Kabul Radio as
saying the United Nations plan to set up the 15-member council had been
'accepted completely'.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, announced in Geneva on
Friday that an agreement had been reached to set up the council of neutral
people to precede a full-fledged interim government which must hold
elections.
Kabul Radio quoted Mr Wakil as calling Mr Boutros Ghali's announcement 'a
practical step towards peace and reconciliation'. The regime is opposed by
hardline guerrillas based in neighbouring Pakistan.
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said most hurdles in the Afghan peace
process had been removed.
A majority of the guerrilla groups were backing the UN plan, he added. 'I
wish that one or two who are left should respect the majority opinion,' he
said.
