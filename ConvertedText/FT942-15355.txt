FT  15 APR 94 / UK Company News: NatWest Bancorp advances


   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor


The pressures on banks from falls in bond and equity prices emerged
yesterday when NatWest Bancorp, National Westminster Bank's US retail bank,
reported an Dollars 8.2m fall in income from its securities portfolio in the
first quarter.
The pre-tax result jumped to Dollars 69.8m (Pounds 47.8m), against Dollars
56.7m, while post-tax profits amounted to Dollars 62.6m (Dollars 60.7m).
Non-interest income fell to Dollars 79.7m (Dollars 96.5m) because of a fall
in securities gains to Dollars 2.6m (Dollars 10.8m) and a non-recurring
Dollars 8.7m sale of stock in the first quarter of 1993.
The bank said that its core performance, excluding non-recurring items, had
increased by 40 per cent. Net interest income rose to Dollars 221.3m
(Dollars 192.3m). However, the return on average equity fell to 11.61 per
cent (13.03 per cent).
