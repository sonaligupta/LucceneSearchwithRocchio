   LONDON


Mr Yeltsin will meet Mr John Major, UK prime minister, in London on January
30, before the UN Security Council summit called by Britain to discuss the
disintegration of the Soviet Union, writes Ralph Atkins in London. Mr Major
is anxious to see Russia integrated swiftly into the UN and to discuss the
security implications of the constitutional upheavals there.
Mr Norman Lamont, chancellor of the Exchequer, yesterday called on UK legal
firms, and financial and insurance to find places for up to 1,000 people
from the former Soviet Union seeking work experience.
