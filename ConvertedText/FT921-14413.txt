FT  16 JAN 92 / International Company News: Olivetti reveals difficulties
with 5% decline in demand

OLIVETTI, the loss-making Italian computers and office equipment group,
yesterday gave an insight into its trading difficulties by announcing a
decline in sales of around 5 per cent to L8,600bn (Dollars 7.17bn) for last
year.
No figures for profits were released. However, some analysts expect the
company to report a loss of at least L200bn for 1991, compared with net
earnings of L60.4bn in 1990.
At a press conference held to coincide with the group's move to a simplified
operating structure, Mr Elserino Piol, Olivetti's director for central
operations, was confident that measures now under way would restore
profitability this year.
The downturn has been particularly acute in Europe. According to industry
sources, European demand for computer hardware fell by 4.9 per cent in
1990-91 and would be static in 1991-92, while prices fell by 35 per cent to
40 per cent in 1990-91.
Mr Bruno Lamborghini, Olivetti's director of economic research, warned that
oversupply, coupled with soft demand and the continuing shift to smaller but
more powerful computers, meant further price cuts were inevitable this year.
However, the reductions were likely to be less severe than in 1990-91.
Olivetti intends to confront the crisis with a mixture of innovation, cost
savings in the form of across-the-board labour cuts and further transfers of
production from Europe to cheaper manufacturing regions such as Singapore.
In stormy meetings with unions last week, the company called for a further
2,500 job cuts in Italy this year. Unspecified redundancies are also
expected at the group's foreign operations, which employ around half its
47,000 workforce.
Olivetti hinted that cuts could hit its Triumph Adler subsidiary in Germany,
which has already closed one plant in Frankfurt.
The decision to move production outside Europe would focus on lower-cost
products, such as office equipment, in which Triumph Adler specialises.
Olivetti's presence in office equipment products would be 'rationalised,' it
warned.
