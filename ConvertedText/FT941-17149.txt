FT  06 JAN 94 / Former banker to sue over BCCI


   By ANDREW JACK


Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfouz, former chief operating officer of the National
Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia, is preparing to sue the government of Abu
Dhabi in connection with the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce
International, writes Andrew Jack.
In a writ expected to be lodged very soon, perhaps today, in London's High
Court, Sheikh Khalid calls for damages of several billion dollars and
alleges conspiracy and deception against him by the Abu Dhabi Investment
Authority and senior officials in the government, the majority shareholder
in BCCI.
The action calls for an indemnity against Sheikh Khalid in the case of any
award against him as the result of a Dollars 10.5bn lawsuit brought by the
liquidators to BCCI against him and National Commercial Bank (NCB).
It also demands a permanent injunction against an alleged continuing
conspiracy between Abu Dhabi and other parties including the liquidators to
BCCI against Sheikh Khalid.
The government of Abu Dhabi said last night: 'This appears to be an attempt
to divert attention from the liquidators' case against Mahfouz.'
At the end of last month Sheikh Khalid concluded a settlement in which he
paid Dollars 225m (Pounds 151.3m) in exchange for a waiver of fraud and
racketeering charges against him brought by Mr Robert Morgenthau, the New
York district attorney.
