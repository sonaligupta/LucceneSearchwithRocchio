FT  25 AUG 92 / France prefers to raise interest rates to protect franc
against ERM

FRANCE would prefer to raise interest rates, as it has in the past, to
protect the franc rather than support any realignment of the ERM, according
to economists in Paris, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris.
'I don't think France would have anything to gain from realignment, but it
could lose a lot of political credibility if it was forced to abandon its
'franc-fort' stance,' said Mr Robin Hubbard, chief economist at Paribas. 'So
far there isn't enough pressure from the dollar to make realignment a
serious possibility. But if the French do vote 'no' in the Maastricht
referendum next month, then France and Germany may have to choose between
realignment and raising interest rates. If necessary the French probably
would go for higher rates.'
