FT  24 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow eases as investors stay
on the sidelines

   NEW YORK


Wall Street
US SHARES eased slightly yesterday as investors and dealers stayed on the
sidelines in the absence of fresh economic news and a lead from the bond
markets, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 4.25 off at 3,272.14, having spent
the entire session trading in a narrow range a few points below last
Friday's closing mark.
The Standard & Poor's 500 slipped 1.39 to 409.91 and the Nasdaq composite of
over-the-counter stocks receded 2.45 to 621.83. NYSE turnover was extremely
light at 157m shares, and falls led rises by 984 to 692.
The direction of investor sentiment remained uncertain yesterday, although
the recent ability of the Dow to hold its own under pressure at the 3,200
level has led some analysts to predict there is enough support for stocks to
push the leading index to new highs in coming sessions.
Du Pont gained Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 46 7/8 in active trading after
Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrett, the brokerage house, raised its valuation of
the stock from 'moderately attractive' to 'very attractive'.
Mr William Young, the DLJ chemicals analyst, upgraded Du Pont because he
thinks the benefits of recent cost cutting and improved fibre, chemical and
automotive markets have brightened the earnings outlook for the group, which
he says may increase its annual dividend later in the year.
Harley-Davidson climbed Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 62 7/8 after Morgan Stanley
added the maker of luxury motorcycles to its model portfolio.
Phillips Petroleum ended Dollars  1/4 down at Dollars 23 5/8 on reports that
its chairman had warned that first-quarter earnings would be 'lousy' and
that there was little chance of an improvement in net income until the third
quarter of this year.
Coleman firmed Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 27 1/4 after Shearson Lehman Brothers
had initiated research coverage of the stock with a prediction of
outperformance. The company went public in January for Dollars 19.50 a
share.
Intel retreated Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 63 1/4 on 2.2m shares as the stock
came under pressure in the wake of a profile in Barron's magazine which
highlighted the increasing competition that the company faces.
Canada
TORONTO weakened after reports of debt worries for privately held Olympia &
York Developments put pressure on the financial services and the real estate
and construction sectors.
The composite index lost 26.3 to 3,443.7 and falls led rises by 118 to 64,
while volume on the exchange totalled 27.1m shares. The financial services
sub-group dropped 2.5 per cent on worries over banks' exposure to O & Y debt
or other commercial real estate borrowers.
The real estate and construction index declined 83.2 to 6,149.0, with
Bramalea and Trizec 'A', both O & Y interests, pressuring the sector most.
Bramalea fell 15 cents to CDollars 3.75 and Trizec 'A' CDollars 3/8 to
CDollars 7 1/8 .
Bank of Montreal slipped CDollars 1 to CDollars 42 1/4 , Bank of Nova Scotia
CDollars 1 1/8 to CDollars 20 1/8 , Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce
CDollars 1 to CDollars 29 3/4 and Royal Bank of Canada CDollars  1/2 to
CDollars 24 3/4 . These four banks are said to have the largest exposure to
O & Y's debt in Canada.
