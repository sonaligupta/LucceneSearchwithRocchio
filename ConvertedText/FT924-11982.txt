FT  23 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Kwik Save buys 12 Grandways


   By PEGGY HOLLINGER


KWIK SAVE, the UK's biggest discount chain, has bought 12 Grandways
supermarkets from privately owned William Jackson for Pounds 13.6m.
The deal comes only a week after Argyll, the supermarket group, paid William
Jackson Pounds 23m for nine stores. The sale to Kwik Save marks William
Jackson's exit from the increasingly competitive supermarket sector. The
family-run company intends to focus on the convenience store market.
Kwik Save said yesterday that the stores, based in Yorkshire and Humberside,
were 'an excellent strategic fit'.
Mr Keith Lovell, finance director, said the difference in price paid by
Argyll and Kwik Save could have been down to 'basic economics . . . A
discounter like us could not afford to pay as much as the majors.'
Kwik Save will fund the purchase through bank borrowings. Mr Lovell said
gearing would remain 'negligible' even after the acquisition.
Earlier this year, Kwik Save had targeted a debt to equity ratio of less
than 10 per cent by the year-end. The acquisition would not be dilutive, he
added.
The 12 stores, which will be handed over on a phased basis, would add
approximately Pounds 45m to sales on an annual basis. They are mostly larger
than the average Kwik Save target of 8,000 sq ft.
Mr Lovell said the company would trade out of 12,000 sq ft in the bigger
stores, and convert the remaining space for rental to concessions.
