FT  11 APR 94 / The Markets: Fighting off the spectral bear - Global
Investor


   By MARTIN DICKSON


   NEW YORK


The coming week may be crucial in establishing whether the recent bounce in
US bond and equity markets signals an end to their sharp slide - at least in
the short run - or was merely a respite from bearish forces.
Last Tuesday's 82 point jump in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and its
further advances later in the week, certainly had many of the classic
characteristics of a market turning point, with an avalanche of anxious
selling suddenly switching to a surge of bargain-hunting buying.
The rebound was also statistically very tidy: a wide array of analysts had
forecast a 10 per cent market correction, and lo, the market turned after a
9.7 per cent drop - right in line with the historical average for a market
correction, both in scale and duration.
But relying on history can be dangerous, and this comforting picture could
be a little too neat. Certainly, Friday's market reversal demonstrated how
closely sentiment in the equity sector remains tied to continued nervousness
among bond traders over the prospects for growth and inflation, and the
possibility of further tightening by the Fed, at or before its May 17 policy
meeting.
This week fixed income desks have to weather a barrage of statistical data,
ranging from the consumer and producer price indices, which should give
comfort to the market, to figures for retail sales, business inventories and
industrial production, any one of which could spook traders if they are so
minded.
Still, the first quarter corporate results season beginning this week should
at least remind equity investors that the US economic outlook remains
remarkably benign, promising solid growth of 3 to 4 per cent, strong
productivity gains, and an annual inflation rate of 3 per cent or less.
Corporate profits in many sectors are likely to be up 10 to 15 per cent this
year, with double digit gains possibly extending to the end of 1995.
The Fed's tightening has had the beneficial effect of knocking a lot of
froth off a market which at the start of the year was beginning to look
dangerously overstretched.
It now looks much closer to fair value, judged by traditional yardsticks.
For example, Abby Joseph Cohen of Goldman Sachs reckons the S&P 500 is
selling at roughly 14 times 1994 operating earnings per share, whereas in
previous periods when inflation was 3.5 per cent or less, the average p/e
was 16.4. A further dip to, or below, the recent trough would throw up
attractive buying opportunities.
Mutual funds
The strength of the US equity market over the next few weeks will depend in
substantial part on the behaviour of the individual investors who have
poured cash into mutual funds over the past two years - and are now
suffering their first serious reversal.
In the wake of the Fed's February tightening, the first phase of the market
correction was driven mainly by market professionals - investment bank
trading desks and the overly maligned hedge funds, which were forced to
liquidate holdings to reduce their leverage. Fund managers window dressing
portfolios at the end of the first quarter also played a part.
Small equity investors remained reasonably sanguine, in part because until
two weeks ago the brunt of the market's decline was borne by the fixed
income sector. The latest statistics suggest there is still a net inflow to
equity mutual funds, albeit at a rate much reduced from the start of this
year, and there are signs of some movement back into the safe haven of money
market funds.
But will these investors will remain quite so relaxed when their fund
managers' first quarter performance statements pop through the letterbox?
The concern is probably overdone. First, small American investors have grown
used to large market swings since the 1987 crash. Second, the overwhelming
weight of professional advice, reaching them from brokers and media pundits,
is that they are not witnessing a prolonged bear market and that they should
avoid selling at the bottom.
Third, with short-term interest rates still very low in real terms, money
market accounts have limited allure, though that will gradually change as
the Fed goes on tightening.
A gradual shift back to money market accounts could exert some drag on
equities, but it is arguable that this will be offset by increased buying of
US equities from corporate pension funds and foreign investors, attracted by
the expanding economy and likelihood of a strengthening dollar.
Mexico
The recovery in US equities last week was mirrored in Chile and Argentina,
which were among the many emerging markets to take a nose-dive after the
Fed's February tightening. But notably absent from this Latin bounce was
Mexico, where stocks fell sharply on the week.
The Mexican market is now down some 25 per cent from its highs of early
February, as domestic political turmoil has reinforced the bearish
sentiments from across the Rio Grande.
Investor nervousness following the peasant rebellion in Chiapas and the
killing of Luis Donaldo Colosio, presidential candidate for the ruling PRI
party, have combined with rising US interest rates to put pressure on the
Peso and force short-term interest rates up sharply.
That, in turn, has analysts revising downwards their estimates for GDP
growth, with some cutting a half a percentage point off figures which
previously ranged from about 2.5 to 4 per cent.
Nor is there much hope of an early end to the political uncertainty, amid
growing evidence that Colosio's death was the result of a conspiracy, rather
than the action of a lone gunman, and continued rumblings from Chiapas.
The PRI's new presidential candidate, Ernesto Zedillo, who belongs to the
party's economic reformist wing, still seems likely to win the August 21
election, though that remains far from cer-tain, given that he has never
held elective office and the party's old guard dislikes him.
Geoffrey Dennis of Bear, Stearns does not see an imminent return to the kind
of virtuous economic and political circle which would substantially lift the
market, but argues that the uncertainty is simply delaying an eventual
upturn from the recent recession.
'Once you get recovery, and the North American Free Trade Agreement also
starts to kick back in, you logically set off on a four, five, six-year
period of sustained growth.'
Provided, of course, that the political upheavals in the first few months of
this year are not merely scratching the surface of more violent political
divisions, which have yet to emerge.
Australian dollar
The price of gold, which rose sharply in March on inflation fears and South
African violence, could move closer to the Dollars 400 mark over the next
few weeks if the run-up to South Africa's election in late April produce
more serious clashes between Zulu forces and the ANC. But given the
influence of South African politics on the metal, is it sensible to use the
gold price as an indicator of inflation psychology, as Mr Alan Greenspan,
the chairman of the Fed, said he was doing recently?
David Hale, chief economist of Kemper Financial Services, argues that Mr
Greenspan should be paying more attention to the Australian dollar as a
barometer of inflationary expectations over the next few months: 'Most
international investors regard it as a good proxy for global inflation
trends because commodities account for about 80 per cent of Australia's
exports and commodity producing companies account for over one third of the
country's stock market capitalisation.'
What does its recent performance show? The currency rose sharply in
late-1993 but since the Fed tightened it has been in a trading range below
its January peak, suggesting that the Fed's tightening has successfully
dampened inflationary fears.
