FT  22 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Dividend hint in utilities


East Midlands Electricity put on one of the best performances in a strong
sector as speculation swept the market late in the day that the company
might be poised to announce a massive special dividend payment to
shareholders.
The rumour circulating among dealers was that East Midlands would on Monday
reveal a one-off payment of 85p a share. This would be a way of avoiding the
restrictive legislation surrounding a possible share buy-back scheme.
All the regional electricity companies (Recs) received permission to buy
back up to 10 per cent of their shares. However three companies - East
Midlands, Southern and Yorkshire - have so far now bought back any shares.
The Recs have now entered their pre-results closed seasons which means that
neither the company nor its directors may deal in shares until the results
are made public. East Midlands shares rose 8 to 711p.
