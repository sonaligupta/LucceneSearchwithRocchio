FT  12 MAR 93 / International Company News: Azabu dismisses 'over-zealous'
bank advisers

AZABU Building, a leading Japanese developer which has Y700bn (Dollars
5.95bn) in outstanding debts, has dismissed the bankers transferred to
restructure the company, apparently because they were over-zealous in
selling-off properties.
Azabu's unusual move is particularly embarrassing for its main bank, Mitsui
Trust and Banking, which had provided the developer with a new president and
senior management staff, all of whom were told that they were no longer
wanted.
The dismissal of the staff was organised by Mr Kitaro Watanabe, one of the
country's best-known developers and stock speculators, who was supposed to
have resigned from active management and taken the ceremonial position of
chairman early last year.
But Mr Watanabe, who still controls a majority of Azabu shares, decided the
Mitsui Trust staff were taking the restructuring far too seriously in that
they were actually selling buildings.
Many Japanese 'restructurings' merely involve the shuffling of buildings
around affiliates in the hope that the property market will quickly improve,
and Mr Watanabe was angry that Mitsui was trying too hard to recover its
money.
'We agreed that Mitsui should sell some of our assets, but if they sell all
of our assets, we would have no business left. Mr Watanabe has a special
feeling for his hotel in Hawaii (the Hyatt Regency Waikiki) and the bankers
even wanted to strip that off,' Azabu said.
Meanwhile, Mitsui Trust claims to be mystified by the ailing company's
sudden belligerence: 'We don't know what they really want to do. We had
agreed on a restructuring and they have suddenly ended the agreement and now
we have no communications with them.'
