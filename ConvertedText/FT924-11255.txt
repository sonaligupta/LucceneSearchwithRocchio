FT  27 OCT 92 / Shephard set to challenge employment spending plans


   By LISA WOOD and ALISON SMITH


MRS Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, is to challenge the spending
proposals for her department put forward by the government's public
expenditure committee.
Mrs Shephard, who along with other ministers was summoned to appear before
the committee, is the first cabinet minister so far to disagree formally
with its recommendations.
The proposals will be considered by the cabinet this week for the first
time.
Other ministers who are likely to put their views to the cabinet are Mr
Peter Lilley, social security secretary, Mr John MacGregor, transport
secretary, and Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary.
The departmental budgets of all three are under particular pressure.
High-profile policies such as London Underground's possible Pounds 1.8bn
extension of the Jubilee Line and the introduction of the council tax next
year are likely to be subjects on which other senior ministers will want to
express views.
The largest part of the Department of Employment's budget is spending on
Youth Training and the adult long-term unemployed.
Training and Enterprise Councils are also playing a leading role in
co-ordinating the counselling and retraining of miners.
The cabinet is likely to have at least one other discussion of the spending
plans before Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, announces the decisions of
his committee in the Autumn Statement on November 12.
As the cabinet agreed in July to stick to the Pounds 244.5bn planned level
of public spending for 1993-94, the discussions will be about the
distribution of government spending within that total rather than any rise
in the total available.
