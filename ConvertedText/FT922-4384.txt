FT  05 JUN 92 / Japan troops bill clears hurdle in parliament


   By Agencies


   TOKYO


JAPAN'S ruling Liberal Democratic Party early today pushed a controversial
bill through a parliamentary committee allowing the despatch of Japanese
troops overseas as United Nations peacekeepers, agencies report from Tokyo.
The bill was passed by the upper house committee after a chaotic 16-hour
session, despite shouting and sign-waving by members of the opposition
Socialist Party. The Socialists vowed to continue the fight when the bill
goes to a vote in a plenary session of the upper house later today.
An earlier version of the bill was passed by the lower house of parliament
late last year amid similar turmoil. The ruling party, which lacks a
majority in the upper house, then agreed to amend the bill as part of a pact
with two small centrist parties in order to get the bill through the upper
house.
As a result, the bill must eventually go back to the lower house for
re-approval, which could take a week.
The bill is designed to allow Japan to send a 2,000-member army unit to take
part in UN peacekeeping missions such as the one in Cambodia. But the
Socialists say the bill violates Japan's post-1945 constitution, which bans
military force to solve international disputes.
They have vowed to stage an 'ox-walk' in the upper house, a form of
fillibuster where members take about 30 minutes each to complete a single
vote.
The Socialists staged protests as the long committee hearing was brought to
a halt with the vote early today. Deputies shouted 'go home' at police
swarming into the committee room.
