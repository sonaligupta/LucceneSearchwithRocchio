FT  17 JAN 92 / International Company News: Siemens ahead 6% in first
quarter


   By ANDREW FISHER

SIEMENS, the German electrical and electronics group, yesterday reported a 6
per cent rise in first-quarter net profits to DM398m (Dollars 249m) and
indicated that earnings for the year ending September 1992 would be around
DM2bn.
It said profits on industrial activities would improve this year after a 20
per cent fall in 1990-91, mainly caused by heavy losses on computers through
its acquisition of Nixdorf and on semi-conductors.
Siemens' profits growth last year stemmed from the doubling of its financial
income to around DM2bn. Mr Karl-Hermann Baumann, the finance director, said
this mainly comprised interest on its large cash and securities holdings,
with Siemens also benefiting from lower write-downs to reflect the value of
its DM15bn of securities.
This year, Mr Baumann expected financial profits to decline slightly. Last
year's jump propelled group pre-tax profits 21 per cent ahead to DM3.4bn.
Because of higher taxes, net profits were only 7 per cent higher at DM1.8bn.
Computer activities produced a net loss of DM781m, which Siemens expects to
be reduced sharply this year. It is also striving to reduce the much
increased semi-conductor losses of some DM500m.
Last year's net profit was a return on turnover of 2.5 per cent, and Mr
Heinrich von Pierer, deputy chief executive and chief executive-designate,
said Siemens hoped to maintain the rate of return in 1991-92.
This yield would produce net profits of about DM2bn, based on his forecast
that turnover should rise by 10 per cent to just over DM80bn. He also
expected new orders to grow by 5 per cent to DM86bn, a sharp slowdown from
last year's 21 per cent increase.
The consolidation of new businesses accounted for 9 per cent of the inflow,
the rest mainly reflecting heavy demand for infrastructure-related products
in the energy, transport, and telecommunications fields. New orders in east
Germany totalled DM3.3bn.
In the first quarter of this year, the new order inflow eased by 1 per cent
to DM20.1bn, with a 4 per cent rise at home and a 5 per cent fall abroad.
Mr von Pierer said the economic slowdown in important markets such as the US
and parts of western Europe would be reflected in the order books.
