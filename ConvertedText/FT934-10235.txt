FT  06 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Historical significance suggested by
Proton cars deal in Europe


   From Dr DENIS MACSHANE


Sir, So a British company is now to distribute made-in-Malaysia Proton cars
in Europe ('World Trade News: 'Proton sets up European venture', November
3). Will historians note this announcement as meaning a) the end of Britain
as an industrial nation with a new role as the sales department for the
third world; b) the empire striking back after 100 years of being forced to
buy made-in-Britain products; c) the beginning of a south-north transfer of
high-tech, high-quality goods?
Or is it time that categories such as 'third world', 'south', or 'developing
countries' are thrown away and new language is found to describe and to
integrate the Asian manufacturing and exporting nations?
