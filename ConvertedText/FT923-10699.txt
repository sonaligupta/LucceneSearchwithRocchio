FT  29 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading


   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE


A QUIET day's trading in stock index futures was enlivened by a late burst
of buying activity which left the market at a premium, writes Christopher
Price.
The September contract opened brightly with buyers deciding Monday's falls
had been overdone, and within minutes it had climbed to 2,370. But the
momentum was short-lived as independent traders sent September tumbling, and
by 9.30am the contract was trading at 2,361, its lowest point of the day.
Support was triggered at this level and September began a slow climb,
although buyers remained scarce. A firm Wall Street helped confidence, and
as on Monday, September finished with a flourish as the last hour's trading
saw a squeeze, County NatWest and BZW being prominent among the buyers.
September ended at 2,387, up 32 points from the previous close and at a
premium of 8 points to its estimated fair value of 12. Volume was a poor
5,298.
Business in the traded options market was similarly quiet, with 19,696
contracts dealt, some 4,200 below Monday's level. The FT-SE option had
nearly 7,000 lots traded. BTR was the busiest stock option on 1,284
contracts.
