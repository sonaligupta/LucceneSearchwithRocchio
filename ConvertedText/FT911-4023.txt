FT  22 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: Cater Allen quits market


   By SARA WEBB


CATER Allen Holdings, the UK financial services and broking group, has
closed down its gilt-edged market-making division.
It joins a long list of houses that have pulled out of the gilts market
since Big Bang in 1986 as a result of over-capacity.
Mr James Barclay, chairman of Cater Allen, said there were no signs of
market conditions improving, despite the fact that the government has
returned to borrowing in the gilts market this year.
Cater Allen Securities, incurred a loss of Pounds 2.5m in the year to April
1991 after a slightly lower one previously.
Since Big Bang, the number of gilt-edged market-makers has fallen from 27 to
18.
