FT  29 APR 94 / International Company News: Eastern says it may fly again


   By RICHARD TOMKINS


Eastern Airlines, once one of the best-known names in US aviation but now
defunct, may start flying again under a plan being considered by its
administrator.
Mr Martin Shugrue, court-appointed trustee of the company under the US
bankruptcy code, said that he was looking at the possibility of re-starting
the airline as an alternative to pressing ahead with its liquidation.
The plan is believed to involve using some of the 50 or so Eastern aircraft
now owned by the airline's senior secured creditors and stored in the Mojave
Desert, California. Its supporters believe that if Eastern can raise the
required capital, it could become another of the low-cost start-up carriers
that have successfully taken market share from the bigger US airlines.
Eastern went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March 1989 amid a bitter power
struggle between its unions and its then chairman, Mr Frank Lorenzo. It kept
flying during attempts to organise a rescue, but was grounded - apparently
for good - in January 1991.
Mr Shugrue, a former vice-chairman and chief operating officer of Pan
American World Airways, was appointed Eastern's trustee in April 1990, and
has since been supervising plans for its liquidation.
Yesterday, however, Mr Shugrue claimed Eastern's creditors would get more
money if the airline went back into business.
