FT  05 AUG 93 / Letter: Risk and the cost of capital


   From Mr JEREMY LEVER


Sir, Lex (August 2) suggests that if electricity companies operate with 'too
much' equity, they incur an 'unnecessarily high cost of capital'. But surely
a company's weighted average cost of capital depends on the riskiness of its
operations and is independent of the company's gearing and hence of the
proportion of that risk borne by shareholders and bond-holders respectively.
Thus, the higher the gearing, the smaller the equity base that is called on
to bear the primary risk: therefore the riskier the equity and, in
principle, the higher the equity's beta. This should offset the effect of
the high gearing in reducing the proportion of the company's total capital
that incurs the debt-equity premium. Otherwise companies could reduce their
cost of capital simply by increasing their gearing - as indeed Lex seems to
believe.
Has Homer nodded?
