FT  06 NOV 93 / How to Spend It: Pick your presents off the mat - Mail-order
catalogues are a mixed bunch. But choose wisely and you could find your
heart's desire, says Lucia van der Post


   THERE ARE some frightening statistics about catalogues


such as that by mid-October, the average American will have been deluged by
68.35 catalogues, the mail-box will have folded up under the struggle and
the accumulated pile on the hall floor will constitute a fire hazard. All
this may also explain why so few novels get read. In the UK we are luckier.
Most (though not all) deluging is our own fault. My solution? When in doubt,
don't send off for the catalogue just in case. Be selective. Decide which is
the one for you, whether it be a charity you choose to support or a
commercial catalogue which is mostly likely to satisfy the desires of your
nearest and dearest. Here, then, is a taster of some of the best catalogues
around. If you send for them now you still have time to have a stress-free
Christmas present-buying time.
