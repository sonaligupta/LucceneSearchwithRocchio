FT  16 NOV 93 / UK Company News: GRE buys US motor insurer for Dollars 100m


   By RICHARD LAPPER


GUARDIAN ROYAL Exchange, the insurer, yesterday made its biggest acquisition
for more than four years, paying Dollars 100m (Pounds 65m) to acquire
American Ambassador Casualty, a Chicago-based motor insurance company, from
Allianz, the German insurer.
The deal, subject to the approval of US regulators, increases GRE's exposure
to the specialised non-standard motor insurance market in the US. 'It
demonstrates GRE's commitment to controlled growth in selected markets,'
said Mr Jim McDonough, international director.
American Ambassador complements GRE's Globe American subsidiary in Ohio,
which also specialises in non-standard risks such as older drivers,
specialist cars or drivers with poor records. The two businesses are in
geographically close locations but have little territorial overlap.
American Ambassador achieved gross premium income of Dollars 88m in 1992 and
a pre-tax profit of Dollars 16m. The company has produced an underwriting
profit for each of the last five years and net assets were Dollars 81m at
the end of 1992. Premium income at Globe amounted to Pounds 39m.
After the deal GRE will derive 11 per cent of its insurance income from the
US, an increase of more than a quarter. The cash consideration is being met
from existing resources and will reduce GRE's net asset value per share by
about 1p. Its solvency ratio, 55 per cent at June 30 1993, will be reduced
to 53.5 per cent.
