FT  29 APR 94 / World Stock Markets: Mexico claws back some of early losses


Mexico
Equities recovered some of the ground lost earlier as investment funds made
end-of-month portfolio adjustments. The key IPC index of 36 top shares ended
down 11.55 points or 0.5 percent to 2,321.33 in active trade of 92.4m.
Analysts said the index may rise in coming sessions to its next technical
resistance point of 2,380, a point at which profit-taking could break out.
Advancing shares topped declining issues 40 to 39.
Textile company Cydsa A series led gainers, with an advance of 7.32 per
cent. Analysts noted Cydsa's report of a loss of 140.87m new pesos in the
first quarter came out too late to affect trading in the stock.
Other rising issues were food producer Herdez A series, up 5.18 per cent,
tile maker Porcelanite A shares, gaining 5.18 percent, and Palacio de Hierro
1 shares, up 5.01 per cent.

quarterly numbers and led declining issues with drops of 15.89 per cent and
9.09 per cent, respectively.
