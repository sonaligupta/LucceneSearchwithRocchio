FT  16 DEC 94 / Funds for local transport schemes


Local authorities have been given the go-ahead to spend more on public
transport projects such as bus priority routes, cycle lanes and pedestrian
safety schemes under funding plans announced by the government yesterday.
The number of local authority schemes has trebled to 37 while the funds
available have increased from Pounds 13m to Pounds 64m.
Mr Brian Mawhinney, transport secretary, unveiled a total local authority
spending programme of Pounds 960m in 1995-96 compared with just over Pounds
1bn planned for this year. However, only Pounds 298m of this total is grant,
compared with Pounds 342m this year. The rest comprises approvals for loans.
