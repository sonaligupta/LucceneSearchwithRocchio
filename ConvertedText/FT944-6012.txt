Mannesmann, one of Germany's leading engineering groups, will begin a joint
venture with Baoshan Iron and Steel to provide a full range of services for
the construction of steel plants in China and south-eastern Asia. The new
operation, in which Mannesmann Demag Huttentechnik (MDH) will hold a 51 per
cent stake, will be called Demag Metal Plant Technology and is to be based
in Shanghai. MDH has built a number of steel plants in China over the last
30 years. The joint venture would enable them to compete more effectively in
other markets in the region, Mannesmann said.
