FT  21 OCT 92 / Bribery claims hit Labor in Australia

THE political integrity of Australia's ruling Labor Party was severely
damaged yesterday by the conclusions of an inquiry into allegedly corrupt
relationships between politicians and businessmen in Western Australia.
Two former Labor premiers of the state were criticised by a Royal Commission
appointed to investigate a series of business dealings known as 'WA Inc',
which are alleged to have cost taxpayers more than ADollars 1bn (Pounds
423m).
The most serious criticism was of Mr Bryan Burke, premier from 1983-1988,
who was found to have acted improperly in handling political donations from
businessmen, and in the 1987 rescue of an investment bank run by Mr Lauri
Connell, a WA entrepreneur.
The inquiry also criticised Mr Peter Dowding, who replaced Mr Burke as
premier and Mr Ray O'Connor, the last Liberal (conservative) premier of WA,
who was accused of accepting a ADollars 25,000 bribe.
The report is likely to prove highly damaging to WA's minority Labor
government, and to Mr Paul Keating's federal Labor government, which must
hold its seats in WA to win the next federal election, due by June next
year.
The six-volume report made no significant mention of federal politicians, in
spite of speculation that illicit campaign funds solicited in WA may have
helped finance Labor's 1987 and 1990 federal election campaigns.
However, the WA government did not release an appendix to the report dealing
with possible breaches of criminal law, which was sent direct to the state's
director of public prosecutions.
The Royal Commission said there was impropriety by politicians and public
officials in a number of areas, including the award of a casino licence and
a purchase by the state government of a mining company from Mr Alan Bond,
the former chairman of Bond Corporation Holdings.
The Commission is expected to produce a second report, in addition to its
confidential recommendations to the DPP, recommending substantial changes in
government procedures to prevent corruption, including strict restrictions
on political appointments to the public service.
