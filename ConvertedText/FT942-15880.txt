FT  13 APR 94 / Observer: Peyton's place


Michael Heseltine, who likes to call himself president of the board of
trade, clearly has failed to charm the likes of Lord Peyton, former Tory
minister.
Peyton has spotted the fact that the government bill to privatise British
Coal fails to acknowledge the office of president of the board of trade, and
suggests that this means 'the president of the board of trade does not in
fact exist'. Wittily enough, he adds: 'Such a state of affairs would
obviously be greeted with mixed feelings by many people.'
Like who, my lord?
