FT  12 MAR 94 / International Company News: Banesto contest opened to
foreigners


   By DAVID WHITE


   MADRID


European banks are to be allowed to bid for control of Banco Espanol de
Credito (Banesto), the troubled Spanish bank for which the Bank of Spain is
mounting a rescue operation.
European Union regulations have forced the Madrid authorities to change
plans which would have ensured that Banesto, with a network of 2,500
branches, stayed in Spanish hands. Bids for the bank were to have been
restricted to banks participating in Spain's Deposit Guarantee Fund, which
is bearing much of the burden of the rescue operation.
However, Mr Luis Angel Rojo, Bank of Spain governor, yesterday told a
parliamentary committee investigating the Banesto affair that these plans
had been abandoned because they would breach European Union rules.
The change also means Argentaria, the state-controlled banking group, can
compete on an equal footing with other bidders. The conditions previously
under discussion were expected to force Argentaria to pay a premium, since
it only began contributing to the fund in 1991.
Argentaria is one of three Spanish banks to have declared an interest in
Banesto, alongside Banco Bilbao Vizcaya and Banco Santander. There is also
speculation about a consortium bid by savings banks.
The deadline for bids has been set for April 25, with a decision due to be
announced on May 9.
The Deposit Guarantee Fund is to plough Pta285bn (Dollars 2bn) into Banesto,
with half coming from the banking sector and half from the Bank of Spain.
The fund will also provide an interest-free loan to Banesto of about
Pta300bn, and will initially subscribe to a Pta180bn capital increase,
making up 73 per cent of Banesto's restructured equity base.
Would-be buyers will have to bid for the whole of this stake and commit
themselves to keeping a fixed proportion.
