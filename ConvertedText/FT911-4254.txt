FT  20 APR 91 / UK Company News: Hawtal Whiting hit by adverse exchange
rates


   By STEVEN WATKINS


POOR TRADING conditions and adverse exchange rates reduced profits at Hawtal
Whiting, the engineering consultancy group, from Pounds 2.17m to Pounds
884,000 pre-tax for 1990.
The 59 per cent downturn was struck on turnover 24 per cent ahead to Pounds
61.58m (Pounds 49.7m).
Mr John Whitecross, chairman, said stringent attempts to cut costs brought
working capital down early in 1990, but a worsening position with debtors
caused a second half rise.
Capital expenditure was down to Pounds 2.7m (Pounds 5m), with borrowings
averaging 52 per cent of capital employed over the year.
Mr Whitecross said that with profits concentrated in the high tax countries
of Germany and the US, and relief currently unavailable on the company's
trading loss in Canada, taxation was an exceptional 84 per cent of profits
at Pounds 743,000. Accordingly, earnings per share fell to 0.14p (16.9p).
The dividend is an unchanged 4p.
