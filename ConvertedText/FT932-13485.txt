FT  23 APR 93 / Holiday bonus from downturn


   By CHARLES LEADBEATER


THE Japanese economic downturn is at least bringing an unaccustomed benefit
to the loyal ranks of Japanese workers: longer holidays.
Most of Japan is preparing to shut down from the end of next week for the
annual 'golden week' holiday, when more than 1m Japanese tourists are
expected to take advantage of the yen's recent strength to travel abroad.
A Labour Ministry survey published yesterday suggests most will have
slightly longer than usual to enjoy their travels. The ministry's survey of
about 1,300 companies found that the average company was providing its
workers with 5.5 days holiday, an increase of half a day from last year.
However at some particularly hard-pressed companies the annual holidays are
being extended even further. Two car component makers are reported to be
giving their workers 12 consecutive days' holiday, while a leading maker of
musical instruments is giving its staff no fewer than 16 days' leave.
In contrast semiconductor makers, which are enjoying strong demand from the
revival of the US economy, have cut holidays to four days from five last
year.
