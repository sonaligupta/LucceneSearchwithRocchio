FT  27 MAY 93 / Backing for Swedish budget


   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES


   STOCKHOLM


Sweden's centre-right minority government yesterday finalised a deal with
the opposition New Democracy party which ensures broad parliamentary support
for the supplementary budget proposals which it announced last month, writes
Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm. The government has agreed to scrap
personal allowances for higher rate taxpayers and to reduce VAT on hotels
and internal travel as part of the agreement.
In return New Democracy has said it will vote for a plan to cut housing
benefits by SKr3bn over three years. The reduction is part of a broad
package of savings designed to reduce Sweden's SKr200bn budget deficit.
