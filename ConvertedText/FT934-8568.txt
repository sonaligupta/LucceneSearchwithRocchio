FT  15 NOV 93 / People: Morrison and Davies get 'divorced'


David Morrison, Goldman Sachs' London-based international currency expert,
has taken a leaf out of the book of Michael Jordan, the US basketball star
who has just announced that he is quitting at the peak of his career. Still
only 41, Morrison is giving up one of the best-paid economic jobs in the
City by resigning as a general partner of Goldman Sachs.
Gavyn Davies, 42, Morrison's long-standing partner, describes Morrison's
decision to retire as 'like a divorce'. The two of them have worked together
for more than a decade; they started as economists at stockbrokers Phillips
and Drew in the late 1970s, moved to Simon & Coates in 1981 and then to
Goldman Sachs in 1986. Two years later they were both made general partners
of the US investment bank, confirming their position as two of the most
respected economists in the City of London.
Morrison, who will be a limited partner of Goldman and will retain an office
there, had begun to tire of the pressures involved in working for a
high-powered US investment bank - the constant travelling and the need to
make speeches all the time.
'Maybe there are fresh challenges out there,' says Morrison, who has not
ruled out re-emerging in the financial markets at some stage. But for the
moment he intends to spend more time with a family which is growing up
rapidly, indulge his passion for motor sport and devote more effort to
helping handicapped children.
Morrison's departure at the end of this month means that Gavyn Davies will
become head of European investment research and chief international
economist. Jeremy Hale will take responsibility for the firm's foreign
exchange forecasts.
