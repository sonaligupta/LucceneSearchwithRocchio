FT  22 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading


   By JOEL KIBAZO


CONTINUED expectations of a cut in UK base rates led to another strong
opening in Footsie futures though the lack of confirmation later dampened
enthusiasm, writes Joel Kibazo.
Trading in the December futures contract on the FT-SE opened at 2,685 and
the expectations on interest rates drove it sharply ahead to reach 2,705
around mid-morning.
The positive mood, however, gave way to caution which left December gently
falling back to the day's low of 2,675 just before lunchtime.
The contract then traded in a 30-point range of 2,675 and 2,695 for the rest
of the session with Wall Street having no impact on the day's activities.
Once again, the future traded at a strong premium to cash throughout the
session although dealers reported fewer opportunities for arbitrage
activity.
December ended at 2,696, up 39 on Wednesday's strong finish and around 29
points above its estimated fair value, the premium that takes into account
dividends and carrying costs. Fair value is estimated at around 23. Turnover
at over 12,000 contracts was very healthy.
Traded options were once again very active with volume reaching 39,021 lots.
The FT-SE 100 option traded 13,525 contracts while Lasmo was the most
actively dealt stock option, recording a total of 2,444 trades by the close,
and was followed by Asda at 1,823.
