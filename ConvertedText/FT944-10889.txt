FT  09 NOV 94 / German parties near policy deal


   By JUDY DEMPSEY

Talks between the three German parties hoping to form the next government
are due to end on Friday, Mr Peter Hintze, general secretary of Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's governing Christian Democratic Union (CDU), said yesterday.
At the same time, the CDU, the Christian Social Union, its Bavarian sister
party, and the Free Democrats, the junior partner in the coalition, expect
to elect the chancellor on November 15. A cabinet is expected to be chosen
within the next 10 days. Unlike previous coalition negotiations which lasted
several weeks, these talks, which have drawn up a rough policy agenda for
the next parliament, have tended to highlight similarities rather than
differences. The main differences, many of which were narrowed if not
resolved yesterday, have focused on taxation. One disruptive issue -
increased powers for police to introduce bugging in homes - has been deleted
from the agenda, while greater access to citizenship for the 6.8m foreigners
in Germany will be discussed on Friday. During yesterday's session, Mr
Hintze said a controversial 'solidarity' income tax surcharge of 7.5 per
cent would be decreased if the annual financial transfers to the five
eastern states were gradually reduced.
