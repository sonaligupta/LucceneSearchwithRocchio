FT  27 JAN 94 / Classic FM reaches out to Europe


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


Classic FM, the commercial classical music radio station, plans to transmit
on satellite to provide a service all over Europe. The decision is linked
with last week's announcement that Classic has been awarded one of two new
FM frequencies in the Netherlands.
Satellite is the easiest way to deliver the Classic signal to the Dutch
terrestrial radio transmitters but it will also mean that Classic will be
available to individuals across the continent.
Sir Peter Michael, Classic chairman, said yesterday: 'It certainly makes
broadcasting sense and it makes commercial sense.'
As well as using the latest satellite technology Classic - whose
shareholders include Time Warner, the world's largest media group,
Associated Newspapers and the GWR local radio group - plans to apply for
more broadcasting licences across Europe. Sir Peter expects the process of
de-regulation of broadcasting to continue and believes that classical music
is one of the most international of all media sectors.
The station, launched in 1992, is expected to apply for a radio licence
coming up in Finland and is interested in other Scandinavian markets.
Sir Peter emphasised that Classic was prepared to look at joint ventures
with continental European partners. As part of its campaign to win the Dutch
licence - beating 27 applicants for the two frequencies - Classic enlisted
the support of Dutch musicians. As a result leading Dutch orchestras such as
the Concert Gebouw are likely to feature on the station.
The audience for Classic, which has attracted a range of advertisers
including airlines, financial services and publishers, is estimated to be
more than 4.7m a week. Sir Peter said: 'It is now more effective than a
small ITV contractor as an advertising medium.'
