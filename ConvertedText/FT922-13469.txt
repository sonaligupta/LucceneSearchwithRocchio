FT  11 APR 92 / Money Markets: Rate cut hopes grow


SHORT sterling sprang ahead but rates eased only slightly as news of the
shock Conservative win in Britain's general election was absorbed by the UK
money markets.
Talk of an immediate cut in interest rates was considered premature, but
speculation that the authorities would reduce base rates in the next three
months continued.
The three-month interbank rate - they key indicator of future base rate
levels - eased only slightly on the day.
Mr Simon Briscoe, senior UK economist at Greenwell Montagu, said the
three-month rate suggested there was a fairly good chance of an interest
rate cut between now and July, but the market was not really 'gunning for a
cut'.
The authorities would probably wait for a stronger pound before deciding to
cut rates, he said.
In spite of the enthusiasm generated in the markets by the Conservative win,
poorer than expected inflation figures suggested there were still good
reasons for the government to wait before cutting interest rates. Figures
from the Central Statistical Office showed a year-on-year increase of 4 per
cent in February, compared with the market's forecast of 3.8 per cent.
'Having said so much about inflation, the Conservatives will have to make
sure they keep the lid on it,' said Mr Briscoe.
Three-month rates stood at 10 7/16 - 5/16 down from 10 7/8 -10 5/8 . One
year rates eased to 10 5/16 - 3/16 from 10 15/16 -10 13/16 .
The June contract opened 87 basis points higher at 90.01 but drifted back
during the day. With trading volumes touching highs not seen since Britain
entered the ERM, the contract stood at 89.92 in late trading.
The Bank of England forecast a liquidity shortage of Pounds 950m this
morning which it revised to Pounds 900 later in the morning. In early
operations it bought Pounds 18m of band-1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent. In
further morning operations it bought Pounds 308m of band-1 bank bills at the
same rate. It continued to operate in the afternoon buying Pounds 54m bills
including Pounds 1m of band-1 Treasury bills and Pounds 53m band-1 bank
bills both at 10 3/8 per cent. It provided late assistance of around Pounds
130m bringing total operations of the day to Pounds 510m. This left the
market apparently under-relieved by around Pounds 400m. But closing rates,
though high at around 11 1/2 per cent, did not suggest that the situation
was really that tight.
