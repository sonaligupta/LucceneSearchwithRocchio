FT  21 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: David S. Smith


Making paper should be a relatively predictable business since demand is so
closely linked to the economic cycle. But the competitive environment can
change extraordinarily quickly as David S. Smith's annual results make
clear. Last year, paper makers were obsessed with price battles with their
customers. This year, they have watched with a mixture of excitement and
alarm as pulp prices have shot skywards. The scale of the rise has made it
easier to pass on the pain to the end users. But, as Inveresk warned earlier
this month, that has not been universally possible.
Smith has done well to avoid the margin squeeze on most paper grades. The
Kemsley mill is complete and can take full advantage of the market strength.
Recent acquisitions are already proving their worth. Not only is Smith
benefiting from the pick-up in demand across Europe; it can also gain from
the greater market penetration for its recycled products.
Yet the 4 per cent rise in Smith's shares yesterday seems excessive after
the company's 33 per cent outperformance against the market over the past
year. Smith's tax charge will double from last year's 11 per cent, pegging
earnings growth. Besides, there is no guarantee that the benign trading
climate for recycled paper will continue. The absurd German recycling
scheme, which has distorted European recycled paper prices for years, has
finally been adjusted. But insanity could easily break out once again.
