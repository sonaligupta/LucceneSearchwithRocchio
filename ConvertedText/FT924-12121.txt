FT  22 OCT 92 / Letter: Captive market reliance undermines British Coal


   From Mr JOHN GRIFFITHS


Sir, The misfortunes of British Coal can to a large extent be ascribed to
the planning of British Coal's own management. It relied on the government
and the CEGB to provide and protect a captive market for it to continue to
sell effectively unrefined coal for naked burning in power stations.
Environmental protection was the least of its worries.
That is analogous to an oil company skipping the need for refineries and
telling its customers to design engines to run on crude petroleum.
With electricity privatised and clean natural gas available, there is no
defence for the traditional power station. Clean coal technology is
essential for new stations as, though the government placed no obligation on
the new generators to continue with British Coal, it insisted they reduce
atmospheric pollution.
The generators chose the obvious solution: gas. However, even had UK coal
been included, British Coal had placed all its development eggs for clean
coal technology in one basket. It had cornered the market for government
support and had barred the way.
Any technical merits of the British Coal 'Topping Cycle' cannot counter the
fact that it is unavailable.
More practical alternatives, of which British Coal was aware, are being
implemented overseas. These projects include British technology from sources
other than British Coal. When the inevitable return to coal takes place, the
UK will once more be relying on imported experience to even stay in the
race.
