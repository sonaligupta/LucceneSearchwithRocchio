FT  12 MAR 92 / Arafat renews blessing for Mideast peace talks


   By TONY WALKER

PALESTINIAN negotiators engaged in peace talks with Israel have shown
bravery and resilience, Mr Yassir Arafat said yesterday in a spirited
defence of continued Palestinian participation in the peace process.
The Palestine Liberation Organisation leader, who appeared to be answering
strong internal criticism of his decision to sanction the process without
direct PLO participation, said: 'Negotiating is a way of fighting in a calm
voice. In it there is a time to attack and a time to retreat. An hour of
negotiating with the enemy may be tougher than years of war.'
Opposition within the PLO stems partly from a fear among senior cadres of
the organisation being marginalised. Concern is also being expressed over
the growing visibility of Palestinians from the occupied territories at the
possible expense of the Palestinian leadership in the diaspora.
Both the Popular and Democratic Fronts for the Liberation of Palestine - the
two largest PLO factions apart from Mr Arafat's dominant Fatah group - have
stepped up criticism of the PLO's exclusion from direct participation.
Israel vetoed face-to-face negotiations with the PLO, and said it would only
deal with Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
