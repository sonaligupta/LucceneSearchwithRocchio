FT  11 APR 92 / UK Company News: Second half boost for Ulster TV


ULSTER Television showed a recovery through 1991 boosted by a significant 11
per cent increase in advertising revenue over the final quarter.
And for the opening three months of the current year there had been a 13 per
cent rise in revenue from that source.
'We remain cautiously optimistic about a gradual improvement in the economy
and are therefore forecasting some modest real growth in our advertising
income in 1992', said Mr John McGuckian, chairman.
In 1991 the group lifted pre-tax profit from Pounds 1.92m to Pounds 1.95m,
after making only Pounds 134,000 (Pounds 1.32m) in the first half as
advertising revenue fell 7 per cent from the effects of the Gulf war and
recession.
Turnover was up to Pounds 25.1m (Pounds 24.7m) with advertising income
accounting for Pounds 23.75m (Pounds 23.72m).
Earnings per share came to 16.18p (11.54p) before exceptionals and 11.26p
(10.82p) after. The proposed final dividend is 4.25p for a total of 7.5p
(6.75p).
