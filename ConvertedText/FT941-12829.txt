FT  28 JAN 94 / Warning made on anti-semitism


A group of leading religious figures yesterday said that anti-semitism was
'alive and literally kicking' in Britain, and called for a change in the law
to protect religious minorities.
The call came in a report for the Runnymede Trust, a body that monitors
trends in social affairs, by a commission that included Rabbi Julia
Neuberger and the Rt Rev Richard Harries, bishop of Oxford. The report says
that between 1984 and 1992 there was an 85 per cent increase in anti-semitic
incidents reported to the synagogues' Board of Deputies.
