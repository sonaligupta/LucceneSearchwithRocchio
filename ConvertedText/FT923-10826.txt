FT  28 JUL 92 / Goodyear reports record net income


   By JOHN GRIFFITHS


GOODYEAR Tire & Rubber, the only surviving large US-owned tyre company,
signalled an end to the recession that has gripped the industry for the past
two years by reporting record second quarter net income of Dollars 109.7m
(Pounds 57m), or Dollars 1.54 per share, on sales of Dollars 3.1bn.
The figure for Goodyear compares with net income of Dollars 22.5m, or 38
cents per share in the 1991 period. It lifted profits for the first half of
the year to another record Dollars 176m, or Dollars 2.48 per share, on sales
of Dollars 5.6bn.
Mr Stanley Gault, chairman, attributed the improved results to new marketing
strategies, production efficiencies, improved cost controls and lower raw
material costs. The former GEC senior executive, who has just completed his
first year in office, is himself widely credited with masterminding a
'cultural revolution' by transforming work practices.
Mr Gault said Goodyear had increased its share of the US replacement tyre
market, while benefiting from a slow but steady increase in US vehicle
production.
The tyre industry - which has a Dollars 53bn annual turnover - made Dollars
1bn collective losses in the past two years but could earn profits exceeding
Dollars 1.5bn next year, according to a study by the Economist Intelligence
Unit.
Excluding sale proceeds and charges associated with continuing restructuring
of Goodyear's global operations - it employs 97,000 worldwide - the
company's operating margin improved to 10.1 per cent in the second quarter
from 7.2 per cent a year earlier, and to 9.2 per cent in the half-year, up
from 6.2 in the year-ago period.
Consolidated debt has fallen to Dollars 2.5bn from Dollars 3.7bn in the
first quarter of last year, reducing Goodyear's debt to debt-plus-equity
ratio to 46.4 per cent from 66.1 per cent a year earlier.
The second quarter figures include an after-tax gain of Dollars 8.3m, or 12
cents a share, from restructuring. Tyre and related sales rose to Dollars
2.5bn in the quarter from Dollars 2.3bn a year ago, and to Dollars 4.8bn for
the half year, up from Dollars 4.3bn. Operating income was Dollars 231m
(Dollars 157.7m) for the quarter and Dollars 417.6m (Dollars 220.5m) for the
first six half. Worldwide unit tyre sales rose 13.3 per cent in the half.
In New York, Goodyear shares rose in early trading but closed at Dollars 62
5/8, down Dollars 3/8.
