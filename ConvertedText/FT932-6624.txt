FT  27 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Prime People sells Bowford for Pounds 1.06m


PRIME PEOPLE, the Manch ester-based specialist training group, yesterday
announced that it was selling Bowford Engineering Services only six months
after reversing into the company in a Pounds 2.8m deal.
At the same time, USM-quoted Prime People announced pre-tax losses of Pounds
392,255 for the 10 months to October 31, against Pounds 575,518 for the
whole of 1991. Mr Peter Hearn, who became chairman in January when Mr Alan
Greenough resigned, said the result was 'disappointing'. Turnover was Pounds
765,840 (Pounds 918,394 for year).
In January, the company warned that Bowford's turnover had failed to improve
from its level at the time of the acquisition. In the event, Bowford
incurred losses of Pounds 170,361 for the six months ended April 30, 1993.
Bowford has been sold to BA Holdings, a company formed by the trustees of
the family settlements of Mr John Ashford, a Prime People director, and Mr
Geoff Bowers and their respective wives. Mr Ashford and Mr Bowers founded
Bowford, which provides technically-based training services, in 1981.
Consideration for Bowford will be Pounds 1.06m. In addition, an intercompany
balance due to Bowford from Prime People of Pounds 637,250 will be waived
and 31m ordinary shares issued to the vendors of Bowford (other than Mr
Bowers) will be converted into 31m deferred ordinary which will have
essentially no rights.
Mr Ashford plans to resign as a Prime People director and will not receive
any compensation for loss of office.
The sale is subject to approval at an EGM to be held on June 18.
