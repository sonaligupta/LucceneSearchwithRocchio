FT  27 JAN 94 / Mercedes faces third loss at truck division

The commercial vehicle operations of Mercedes-Benz, the world's leading
truck maker, will suffer a third successive annual loss in 1994, Mr Helmut
Werner, chief executive, warned yesterday.
The car division, which also suffered an operating loss in 1993, was
expected to return to profit, however, helped by a forecast 12 per cent
increase in sales to 570,000.
Mr Werner said Mercedes, the automotive subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, had
embarked on a 'radical rethinking' of its production structure and would
increase the share of its car production outside Germany to 10 per cent in
the medium-term from 2 per cent at present. Production would rise in
countries such as the US, Mexico, South Korea and India. Mercedes expected
shortly to sign a deal with Tata, the Indian vehicle maker, to assemble up
to 15,000 E-Class cars a year from 1995.
The company would also cut the level of in-house manufacturing from 45 per
cent at present to below 40 per cent by 1998, making greater use of outside
components suppliers.
Mr Werner said Mercedes planned to enter more co-operative ventures with
other vehicle makers and suppliers. It was also seeking a significant
increase in productivity, not only in labour but also in capital and
organisation. Capital spending was being cut to DM18.7bn (Dollars 10.6bn) in
the five years from 1994 to 1998 from the DM21bn previously planned for 1993
to 1997.
Turnover was forecast to rise by 5 per cent this year to DM68bn following a
3 per cent fall last year to DM64.6bn. Daimler-Benz, of which Mercedes
accounts for about two-thirds of group turnover, made a loss of DM2bn in the
first nine months of 1993 under US accounting rules.
'We shall be able to achieve more with our available funds than in the
past,' Mr Werner said. 'High investment expenditure is not always a sign of
efficient performance.'
Capital productivity had fallen steadily in recent years leading to 'a
dramatic increase in depreciation', he said. 'We have to deploy our
investment more efficiently.' The company had cut costs by DM4bn in 1993,
and planned to close the cost gap with Japanese producers by 1998.
Mercedes planned to cut its domestic workforce by a further 8,000 jobs this
year to 151,000 by the end of 1994. Passenger vehicle production - cars and
four wheel drive vehicles - was forecast to jump to 850,000-900,000 by 1998
with the addition of new ranges.
