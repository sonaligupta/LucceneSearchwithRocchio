FT  29 APR 94 / International Company News: Moody's assigns ratings to
reflect derivatives


   By TRACY CORRIGAN


Moody's, the US ratings agency, plans to start assigning specific ratings to
institutions, based on their creditworthiness as counterparties in the
derivatives market.
The expanded coverage is designed 'to meet a clear market need for credit
assessments that apply specifically to the financial capacity of individual
obligors to meet their financial contracts,' said Moody's associate
director, Mr John Kriz.
He warned that bond and deposit ratings may not accurately reflect an
obligor's creditworthiness from a derivatives claim perspective.
As a first step, Moody's has assigned 'counterparty' ratings to 276 US banks
and thrifts which are participants in the derivatives markets. Twenty-five
of these ratings are lower than for the institutions' domestic deposit
ratings, typically by one notch.
The differences 'reflect analytical concerns such as the relative standing
and potential loss content of financial contract claims, such as
derivatives, vis-a-vis domestic deposits,' the agency said.
Until now, Moody's has rated only derivative products companies such as
Salomon Brothers' Swapco. Other ratings apply to the debt, rather than the
institution.
