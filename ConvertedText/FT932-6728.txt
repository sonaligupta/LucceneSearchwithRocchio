FT  27 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Welsh language post filled


LORD Dafydd Elis Thomas, former leader of Plaid Cymru in the Commons, is to
be chairman of the new statutory Welsh Language Board.
This was announced by Mr David Hunt, the Welsh secretary, when moving the
second reading of the Welsh Language bill in the Commons yesterday.
Mr Hunt looked to the bill, already approved by the Lords, to promote the
wider use of the Welsh language which was now enjoying 'something of a
renaissance'.
He said it would provide a flexible and lasting legal framework within which
the Welsh language could prosper and flourish for many generations to come.
