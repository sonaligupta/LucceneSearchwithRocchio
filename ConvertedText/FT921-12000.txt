FT  29 JAN 92 / International Company News: Nova set back by CDollars 675m
charge

WEAK chemicals markets and a large fourth-quarter writedown pushed Nova
Corporation of Alberta into a CDollars 629m (USDollars 542.2m) loss from
continuing operations last year.
The setback was due largely to an after-tax restructuring charge of CDollars
675m, the bulk of which was applied to chemicals assets. The company said
the charge would boost future after-tax earnings by about CDollars 50m a
year, thanks to lower depreciation expenses.
The net loss for 1991 was CDollars 923m, or CDollars 2.99 a share, compared
with earnings of CDollars 185m, or 55 cents a share, the previous year. The
figures include losses of CDollars 294m last year and CDollars 18m in 1990
from Nova's 43 per cent interest in Husky Oil, which has subsequently been
sold.
Revenues fell to CDollars 3.1bn from CDollars 4bn.
Fourth-quarter income from continuing operations, before the restructuring
charge was CDollars 7m, down from CDollars 67m a year earlier.
Nova said that while its natural gas pipeline business earned 'steadily
increasing profits', earnings were hit by the weak performance of the
chemicals division.
Operating income from pipelines for 1991 advanced to CDollars 365m from
CDollars 279m. Nova transports almost all Alberta's natural gas output from
the wells to export points on the province's borders.
But earnings from chemicals tumbled to CDollars 29m, including a CDollars
16m fourth-quarter loss, from CDollars 373m. While margins have stabilised,
they remain depressed. The company said it expected little or no improvement
in the chemicals market for the time being.
