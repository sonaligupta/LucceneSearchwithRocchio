FT  04 AUG 92 / Letter: Catalan flags fluttering in Olympic city make a
passionate point


   From Ms ELISABETH MIRO


Sir, I refer to Peter Bruce's article 'Catalan socialists and nationalists
play games with the Games' (July 24). While I respect and applaud a
diversity of opinions about the economic and political reality of Catalonia,
and recognise that it must be difficult for a person outside Catalonia fully
to understand the feelings of people who were born or who live and work
here, I must take issue with parts of Mr Bruce's article.
When he states that Catalonia is a 'small, semi-industrialised region on the
margins of Europe', he is ignoring economic statistics (Catalonia's gross
domestic product in 1991 stood at 102.28 per cent of the EC average), and
permitting prejudices to influence his definition of marginal. Many other
political and economic observers are, on the contrary, naming Barcelona,
Catalonia's capital, as the capital of the Mediterranean.
When he refers mistakenly to 'poor Madrid' as having had to fund half of the
Olympic housing, etc, may I remind Mr Bruce that Catalonia has always been a
net payer of taxes to the Spanish state and is merely receiving now public
investment that should have been undertaken years ago. Mr Bruce warns that
an 'occasional youth wearing 'Free Catalonia' on his T-Shirt' might throw
himself in front of the cameras. I suggest that Mr Bruce should visit
Barcelona and count the Catalan flags hung from balconies. He may conclude
that not only an occasional extremist youth feels Catalonia is his country,
but the majority of the population.
