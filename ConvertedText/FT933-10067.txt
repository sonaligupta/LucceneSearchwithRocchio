FT  06 AUG 93 / Mexican retreat on housing rights


   By DAMIAN FRASER


   MEXICO CITY


THE MEXICAN government has sought to quell rising protests at a law which
eliminates rent controls and curbs tenants' rights in Mexico City. It has
promised to protect existing tenants from the law's impact for five years.
The law, passed by Congress last month, removes ceilings on rent increases,
eliminates the one-year minimum for a housing contract, and simplifies the
legal eviction of a tenant. The aim was for the law to stimulate investment
in Mexico City's housing market, widely believed to have been depressed by
the rent controls and tenants' rights.
However, citizens' groups, unions and opposition parties bitterly opposed
the law, and led street protests against it.
President Carlos Salinas has partly bowed to this by promising to postpone
application of the legislation to existing tenants for five years. He will
also propose measures to stimulate housing investment.
The new law will apply to all new tenants, though, so citizens' groups are
to continue their protests.
