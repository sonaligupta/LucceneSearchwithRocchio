FT  05 AUG 93 / International Capital Markets: UK banks pick up further
Italian sell-off business

UK MERCHANT banks have won a further substantial stake in Italy's
privatisation plans with the announcement of valuers and co-ordinators for
some of the most important deals in the disposal programme.
Schroders and Fox Pitt Kelton are to value Ina, the life insurance group, in
which the government hopes to float an opening stake early next year.
Schroders has already carved out a strong position in transactions in the
financial services sector, while Fox Pitt Kelton is a specialist in
insurance.
Kleinwort Benson, the merchant bank which earlier valued the big Crediop
long-term lending group, has been appointed to value the Enel electricity
generating authority. Timing will depend on new laws changing the company's
monopoly and the tariff structure.
The treasury announced that four leading Italian banks would act as global
co-ordinators for the Ina flotation, along with Goldman Sachs. It also
confirmed the job of co-ordinating the sale of shares in the IMI financial
services group would be done by IMI itself and SG Warburg. A valuer for IMI
will be appointed by the end of this month.
Responsibility for appointing banks to value and manage the privatisations
of several other public sector groups has been devolved to their mangements,
which will have to reach a decision by September 15. The list includes Banca
Commerciale Italiana and Credito Italiano, two of Italy's biggest banks, the
Stet telecommunications holding company and the Agip oil group.
