FT  04 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Schroders rises in first half and increases
dividend


   By PAUL TAYLOR


SCHRODERS, the international merchant and investment banking group, said
yesterday that profits for the first half of 1993 were higher than for the
same period last year.
The group which currently does not disclose detailed interim figures, said
net profits for the whole of 1992 were Pounds 67m (Pounds 56.1m).
From next year the group will be required under the EC Bank Accounting
Directive to change the way its accounts are presented, to disclose its
inner reserves and charge loan losses in full in the year in which they are
recognised.
In a brief announcement to the Stock Exchange yesterday, Schroders said it
was increasing its interim dividend to 4p from 3p a year earlier.
Mr George Mallinckrodt, chairman, said that all functional and geographic
areas of the group had performed well. 'It was across the board. 'The first
half has been kind to us because the environment has been a good one.'
The 'star performer' in the first half had been the global investment
management business bolstered by rising markets, he added.
Schroders is believed to have between Pounds 42bn and Pounds 43bn in funds
under management.
