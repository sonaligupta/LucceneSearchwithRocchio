FT  05 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Anglian Water raises dividend by 10%


   By ANGUS FOSTER


ANGLIAN WATER, regarded as one of the most cautious of the 10 privatised
water companies, yesterday adopted a more aggressive dividend policy with a
proposed 10 per cent increase in dividends for the year to March 31.
The company is recommending a final of 13p to make a total of 19.3p (17.5p).
The rise gives real growth of 5.3 per cent making Anglian the first of the
water companies to depart significantly from the assumption of 4 per cent
real growth agreed during the 1989 privatisation. Earnings per share grew 13
per cent to 51.7p (45.9p).
The shares gained 8p to 437p as the stock enjoyed a partial re-rating.
Mr Bernard Henderson, chairman, said the increase was a reward for
shareholders and followed improvements in customer service.
But the decision may prompt another reprimand from the Office of Water
Services, the water regulator, which last year warned that dividend
increases should not be higher than for the stock market generally. This
view was rejected by the water companies.
Pre-tax profits increased 12 per cent from Pounds 152.6m to Pounds 171.3m.
'It's been a good year and we're in excellent shape,' Mr Henderson said.
Turnover advanced by 14 per cent to Pounds 523.1m (Pounds 460.6m), mainly
due to price increases of 15.2 per cent. However, the sion among industrial
customers. Increases this year will be lower at 9.4 per cent, but Anglian's
prices remain among the highest in the country.
Operating expenses increased 12 per cent to Pounds 241.4m, mainly due to
inflation and increased standards. Depreciation was 18 per cent higher at
Pounds 45.6m (Pounds 38.8m), reflecting the increased capital expenditure
programme to improve sewerage, water quality and beach quality.
Capital expenditure and infrastructural renewals rose 29 per cent to Pounds
294.9m. Mr Chris Mellor, finance director, said spending would rise another
Pounds 50m to Pounds 345m this year.
Net borrowings, which rose from Pounds 194.7m to Pounds 303.8m during the
year, will increase again and gearing is set to rise from 18 per cent at the
year end to 23 per cent, he said.
At the interim stage Anglian reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 91.9m on
sales of Pounds 261m.
