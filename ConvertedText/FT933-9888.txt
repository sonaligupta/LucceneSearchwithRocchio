FT  06 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Gold shares tumble as bullion
price weakens


Wall Street
US STOCK markets struggled to make any headway for the third straight day,
with share prices trading in a narrow range either side of opening values,
writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 3.08 easier at 3,548.97 and the more
broadly based Standard & Poor's 500 was 0.41 off at 448.13, but the Nasdaq
composite firmed 1.71 to 715.50, another all-time high. Trading volume on
the New York SE was 262m shares.
The inability of the stock markets to break out of three days of
directionless trading is due primarily to uncertainty over the passage of
President Clinton's first budget through Congress. Yesterday the House of
Representatives was due to vote on the deficit-reduction package, and today
the Senate is scheduled to pass its vote.
Although last-minute efforts by the Clinton administration appeared, as of
yesterday, to have ensured that the budget would be approved, investors fear
that if it falls at the final hurdle, bond prices will drop sharply,
triggering a rapid sell-off in the equity markets. Consequently, investors
and dealers have been reluctant to commit themselves to the markets over the
past few days.
Among individual issues, gold shares tumbled following a sharp decline in
gold bullion prices on world markets. American Barrick Resources fell
Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 24 3/8 , Newmont Mining Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 53
1/2 , Newmont Gold Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 45 1/2 , Homestake Mining
Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 18 3/4 and Battle Mountain Gold Dollars  3/4 to
Dollars 9 1/4 , all in exceptionally heavy trading.
Delta Air Lines receded Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 49 1/2 after the big carrier
announced sharp cuts in air fares as it fired the latest shot in the
long-running price war. Other carriers quickly reduced their own fares,
leading to heavy selling throughout the sector. AMR, parent of American
Airlines, fell Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 63 1/8 , USAir slipped Dollars  1/2
to Dollars 16 5/8 and UAL dropped Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 142.
Quaker Oats climbed Dollars 1 to Dollars 64 1/4 after the company announced
a 31 per cent increase in second-quarter earnings per share, a better
improvement than analysts had expected.
Retailers were mixed. JC Penney retreated Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 43 1/2
after announcing that its same-store sales fell 3.1 per cent last month,
while Wal-Mart put on Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 25 3/4 on news of higher
sales.
On the Nasdaq market, Microsoft advanced Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 74 3/4
after the company said that it plans to become a minority investor in
multi-media ventures.

HEAVY losses in gold shares drove the natural resource-heavy Toronto Stock
Exchange to a sharply lower close. Gold issues tumbled after Comex gold
futures fell steeply: most active were the December futures, which slid
USDollars 22.60 to USDollars 380.70 an ounce.
The TSE 300 index finished 41 points, or 1.1 per cent, down at 3,947.6 and
declines led advances by 454 to 296 after volume of 53.4m shares valued at
CDollars 577m. The golds sector index lost 738.1 points, or 7.7 per cent, to
8,848.5.
