FT  10 JAN 92 / Wintry conditions bring chaos to parts of country


Under the weather: Birmingham city centre was hit by flooding amid wintry
conditions that brought chaos to many parts of country. Up to 6in of snow
fell in mid Wales and rivers burst their banks in the West Country. The
village of Ewyas Harold in Hereford and Worcester was cut off by floodwater.
Northamptonshire and Cambridgeshire were among the worst affected areas,
with many roads impassable. The River Avon burst its banks at Clay Coton in
Northamptonshire and the A5 was closed by flooding at Towcester.
The Severn Bridge was closed to high-sided vehicles because of strong winds,
while storms disrupted Sealink's Irish Sea ferry crossings. Sailings out of
Holyhead and Fishguard were cancelled or delayed.
The A470 main route over the Brecon Beacons was blocked by snow, with
drifting caused by strong winds making other roads dangerous.
In Gloucestershire several main roads were closed by floodwater. One of the
main routes into Cheltenham was blocked when the River Chelt burst its
banks. In Scotland a combination of flooding and ice forced the closure of
roads near Gateside in Fife.
The worst of the conditions were expected to have cleared by this morning.
Most of the country can look forward to several days of cold, dry and sunny
weather.
