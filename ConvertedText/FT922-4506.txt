FT  05 JUN 92 / Observer: Enigma


Advertising agency Saatchi and Saatchi is never averse to a bit of
publicity, even though it has recently been in the news almost as much for
the financial crises of its parent group as for its advertising
achievements.
But can the British Conservative Party's favourite ad agency really be
considering taking on the campaign of the enigmatic H. Ross Perot, the
as-yet undeclared candidate for the US presidency? There are strong and
growing rumours that Saatchi and Saatchi has been approached by the gung-ho
Perot.
The selectively press-shy Maurice Saatchi restricted himself to a brief 'no
comment' - which isn't necessarily the same as 'not true'.
