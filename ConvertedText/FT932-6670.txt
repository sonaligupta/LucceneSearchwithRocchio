FT  27 MAY 93 / Observer: 'Committed' suicide


Are you a charismatic leader? If so, you would be well advised not to
mention the fact in a job application, not even if you are committed and
dynamic into the bargain.
All of those terms are on a black-list being circulated by London headhunter
John Courtis of phrases now odds-on to send executive candidates' hopes
crashing into the recruiter's waste bin.
It is likewise best to avoid describing yourself as seeking a new challenge
either as a self-starter, team-player, communicator, strategist or
conceptual thinker - whether or not successful, market-oriented, loyal,
assertive, conscientious, innovative, and/or enthusiastic.
One of the few claims that remain admissible in the Nasty Nineties, he says,
is membership of the high-IQ society Mensa . . . but only if you have since
resigned.
A further point, which might be useful to executives still in jobs as well
as to those seeking them, emerges from Courtis's advice on applying through
consultants, as distinct from directly to an employer. 'Never refer to them
as agencies,' he warns.
'Most agencies will be flattered if you call them consultancies. Nearly all
consultants will be offended if you call them agencies.'
So anyone with a score to settle against McKinseys or the like, now knows
how to proceed.
