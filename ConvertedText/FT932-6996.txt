FT  26 MAY 93 / Letter: First define money supply


   From Mr R A LEDINGHAM


Sir, Before the Bank of England develops even more sophisticated measures of
money supply, should it not be more precise in defining that which is being
measured? ('Bank may use new measure of money', May 17).
An increase in interest rates (ie price) tends to reduce the 'supply' of
money. Either money reacts in exact opposition to market forces, or M1 to M4
reflect money demand not money supply. In a closed economy, there will be a
distinct correlation between retail money supply and money demand. In the
UK's deregulated financial markets, with cross-border, cross-currency access
to funding and derivative markets, such a correlation is far from certain.
Should we not be considering more sophisticated direct measurement of money
demand? There could be two basic measurements, MD1 could aggregate
short-term borrowings at variable interest rates (credit card balances) and
MD2 could aggregate long-term borrowing at variable interest rates
(mortgages).
MD1 would serve to measure the effect of short-term interest rates on the
dynamics of the economy and MD2 would serve to remind us of how we got into
the mess in the first place.
