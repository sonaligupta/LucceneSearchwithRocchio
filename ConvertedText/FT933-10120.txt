FT  05 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei firms ahead of
new government taking office

ARBITRAGE activity dominated trading as most investors remained inactive
ahead of the swearing in of the new coalition government today, and share
prices firmed in tandem with the futures market, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The Nikkei average closed 139.91 up at 20,497.55. The index fell to the
day's low of 20,298.93 on a decline in the futures prices shortly after the
opening; but later rose to a high of 20,667.87 in the afternoon session.
Volume increased to 300m shares from 269m. Arbitrageurs led trading, while
some financial institutions were seen shuffling portfolios. Gains led
declines by 569 to 397, with 195 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all
first section stocks added 14.42 at 1,671.64, and in London the ISE/Nikkei
50 index edged up 0.22 to 1,269.44.
The futures market firmed on hopes of fiscal and monetary support for an
early economic recovery. Mr Jason James at James Capel said a more unstable
government suggested the higher possibility of income tax cuts, since more
elections would increase the importance of the ordinary voter.
Meanwhile, Dai-Ichi Mutual Life yesterday released a report assessing the
level of shares in cross-shareholdings. It said that 44 per cent of total
listed shares were held by stable shareholders. Taking this figure into
account, Dai-Ichi reckons that the average price-earnings ratio for Japanese
shares averages around 17 per cent.
Banks gained on hopes of lower interest rates. Industrial Bank of Japan
advanced Y100 to Y3,490 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Y50 to Y2,440.
Mitsubishi Kasei, a chemical maker, climbed Y19 to Y520 following reports
that the company had discovered an enzyme which causes Alzheimer's disease.
Nikken Chemical, an affiliate of Mitsubishi Kasei, moved up Y10 to Y1,280.
Exporters saw only modest gains due to looming fears over the higher yen.
Fujitsu rose Y6 to Y745 and NEC put on Y1 at Y1,000. Toyota Motor advanced
Y20 to Y1,670 but Nissan Motor lost Y4 to Y709.
In Osaka, the OSE average appreciated 54.28 to 22,491.37 in volume of 17m
shares, helped by buying of bio-technology and financial issues. Kyocera
moved ahead Y160 to Y6,440.
