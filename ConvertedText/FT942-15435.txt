FT  15 APR 94 / Accounting ethics proposed


A new ethical framework governing chartered accountants' objectivity and
independence was proposed yesterday by the profession's Joint Ethics
Committee.
The committee is suggesting an 'analytical approach' to replace the
piecemeal standards governing ethical standards.
It wants accountants to consider the expectations of those directly affected
by their work, the public, the environment in which the work is conducted,
the threats to objectivity and the safeguards needed to offset any threats.
