FT  01 DEC 94 / Magnet advisers agree out-of-court settlement


   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent


Advisers and bankers to the failed 1989 management buy-out of Magnet, the
fitted kitchen retailer, yesterday formally announced an out-of-court
settlement to end their large-scale legal action.
The terms of the settlement remain confidential but it is understood that
Arthur Andersen, the adviser to the Magnet management, has, as anticipated,
agreed to pay less than Pounds 50m to Bankers Trust which had originally
claimed damages of about Pounds 600m.
Bankers Trust, the US bank which headed a syndicate of banks which financed
the buy-out, had said Arthur Andersen was negligent in failing to provide it
with an objective report on Magnet's financial health. Arthur Andersen had
denied negligence, saying its duty was to Magnet, not Bankers Trust.
GE Capital had also sued Bankers Trust for Pounds 70m, claiming it had
failed to discharge its responsibilities as syndicate leader.
The Magnet buy-out proved one of the most conspicuous City disasters of the
late 1980s. It cost its backers, led by Bankers Trust, a total of Pounds
629m, making it the largest buy-out ever staged.
Lower-than-expected profits, the recession and high interest rates meant
that the highly-borrowed company rapidly ran into trouble. It was sold
earlier this year for just Pounds 56m.
