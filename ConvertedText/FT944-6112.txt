FT  30 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: Hillsdown Holdings steps up
size of syndicated loan


   By GRAHAM BOWLEY


Hillsdown Holdings, the UK food manufacturing group, is increasing the size
of a syndicated loan arranged by Kleinwort Benson and Barclays from Pounds
600m to Pounds 700m due to demand from participating banks, Kleinwort Benson
said yesterday. The loan is expected to be signed on December 9.
The loan is to refinance Hillsdown's existing Pounds 275m loan, launched in
1992, at 45 basis points over the London interbank offered rate (Libor). It
also replaces a CDollars 120m facility launched in 1991.
The facility fees on the deal are 12 1/2 basis points for the first five
years and 15 basis points for years six and seven. The margin on the deal is
15 basis points over Libor for the first five years and 17 1/2 basis points
for the remaining two.
Finnish Export Credit, the state-owned export-financing vehicle, has
launched a Dollars 180m three-year loan arranged by Chemical Bank. The
revolving credit is priced at 12.5 basis points over Libor and replaces a
Dollars 100m credit facility signed in January 1993 at a price of 55 basis
points over Libor.
Volvo, the Swedish motor group, has launched a Dollars 750m seven-year loan,
arranged by Enskilda Corporate and Svenska Handelsbanken. The facility is
priced at 15 basis points over Libor for years one to five and 20 points
over Libor for years six and seven.
