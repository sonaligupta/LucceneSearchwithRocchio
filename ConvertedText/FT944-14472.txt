FT  22 OCT 94 / Unease at N Korean nuclear agreement


   By FRANCES WILLIAMS, JOHN BURTON and GEORGE GRAHAM


   GENEVA, SEOUL, WASHINGTON


The US and North Korea signed an agreement yesterday to relax nuclear
tension in the Korean peninsula in spite of signs of international
reservations about the wisdom of providing financial aid and advanced
technology to a country that continues to flout the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation treaty.
The board of the International Atomic Energy Agency will meet in Vienna next
Tuesday to discuss what it considers the 'troublesome precedent' set by the
accord, under which Pyongyang will freeze and then dismantle its nuclear
programme.
The agency is concerned that there will be a delay of several years before
the agency can have full access to North Korea's nuclear sites, putting it
in non-compliance with the treaty.
Many South Koreans have also expressed reservations about the pact because
the US is felt to have made too many concessions to the North. In a recent
South Korean opinion poll, almost 60 per cent opposed the deal.
In Washington, President Bill Clinton said the agreement was 'a good deal'
for the US. 'The entire world will be safer as we slow the spread of nuclear
weapons,' he said. But the Republican party complained the administration
was rewarding North Korea for violating the non-proliferation treaty.
The framework document signed yesterday in Geneva outlines steps to be taken
by each side, starting with the freeze by North Korea of its existing
nuclear programme and a halt to the construction of two graphite-moderated
nuclear reactors.
The US will begin to form an international consortium to organise and
finance a Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.5bn) programme for two 1,000MW light-water
reactors.
