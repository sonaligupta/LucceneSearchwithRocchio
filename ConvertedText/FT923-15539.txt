FT  01 JUL 92 / International Company News: Pirelli unions seek meeting


   By HAIG SIMONIAN


UNION leaders at Pirelli, the loss-making Italian tyres and cables group,
yesterday sought an urgent meeting with Mr Giulano Amato, the new prime
minister, to discuss the plant closures announced by the group earlier this
week.
As part of its plan to return to profitability in 1992, Pirelli announced
the closure of a tyre plant at Messina, in Sicily, with the loss of 720
jobs. A further 300 redundancies will cover the group's Tivoli plant, near
Rome.
Earlier this year, Pirelli announced the loss of 500 jobs at various
operations in the Milan area.
Yesterday, unions called an eight-hour strike for today and threatened to
occupy the works destined for closure.
The latest job cuts in Italy follow a number of redundancies and plant
closures at Pirelli's foreign operations aimed at cutting costs and raising
productivity. The company announced earlier this week that it had broken
even at the operating level in the first five months of this year.
