FT  21 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading


   By JOEL KIBAZO


Stock index futures closed at the lowest level of the day as renewed fears
of higher US interest rates to combat inflation caused jitters in the London
market, writes Joel Kibazo.
Traders in the derivatives were unnerved during the afternoon by comments
from Mr Greenspan suggesting that the recent slide in the US dollar could
raise inflation.
The September contract on the FT-SE 100 had opened at 3,100, just ahead of
cash, and traded sideways for the next few hours, with the mid-morning
release of economic data on the UK money supply and retail sales making no
impact on trading.
The contract drifted lower just ahead of lunchtime on the back of a
weakening gilts sector, before Mr Greenspan's testimony brought about
concerted selling in the last hour, as dealers also reacted to a poor
opening on Wall Street.
September closed at 3,076, down 22 from its previous finish and at a 7-point
discount to its fair value premium to cash of about 6 points. Volume
improved to 14,322 lots.
There was also better turnover in the traded options sector. Closing volume
was 27,216 contracts, with 10,312 dealt in the FT-SE 100 option. BT led the
league table among the stock options, with a trade in the August 420 puts
being the biggest contributor to the day's total of 1,702.
