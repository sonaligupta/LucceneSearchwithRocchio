FT  12 MAR 92 / Election '92: Treasury forecasts - Correction


IN SOME editions of yesterday's FT, the article headlined 'Big boost in
government investment will help hesitant upturn', contained some errors. The
Treasury is predicting a 10.75 per cent increase in government investment
this year, not next year as stated. Business investment last year fell 11.75
per cent, while the Treasury's Autumn Statement in November projected growth
in gross domestic product this year of 2.25 per cent.
