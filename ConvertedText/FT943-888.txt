FT  27 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Sycamore director leaves


   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY


Sycamore Holdings, the loss-making laboratory, office, and garden furniture
group, yesterday announced the resignation of Mr Adam Kingdon, its
operations director.
In July the company announced the resignation of non-executive director Mr
Michael Hunton. Three days later Sycamore warned of substantial write-offs
for the financial year and said its bankers were reviewing the level of
financing facilities in light of the expected provisions.
In August Sycamore announced pre-tax losses for the six months to 31 March
of Pounds 1.84m, against losses of Pounds 6.85m; turnover was Pounds 9.71m
(Pounds 10.16m). Operating losses stood at Pounds 609,000 (Pounds 4.69m).
Sycamore has been in discussions with its bankers since last year, when the
value of net assets fell to less than half its called up share capital.
Mr Kingdon joined Sycamore in April 1993.
Sycamore's shares closed unchanged at  1/2 p yesterday.
