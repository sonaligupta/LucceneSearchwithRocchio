FT  07 JAN 94 / Collusion charge by Republicans


   By REUTER


   WASHINGTON


Top Republicans accused the US Justice Department yesterday of colluding
with the White House to shield documents related to President Bill Clinton's
involvement in a failed Arkansas real estate venture, Reuter reports from
Washington.
'It's mind-boggling to think that the White House and the Justice Department
would work together in a matter that might involve some criminal activity,'
said Mr Bob Dole, the Senate Republican leader, speaking on the Fox Morning
News.
'I don't know of any precedent for this,' he said.
'It seems to me this cries out for an independent counsel.'
The White House said on Wednesday that Mr Clinton's personal lawyer had
arranged to have the Justice Department subpoena records on Whitewater
Development, the failed vacation-home developer.
The subpoena had the effect of sealing the documents, closing them to public
scrutiny.
Ms Dee Dee Myers, the White House spokeswoman, said the White House began
yesterday to turn over the files, which she said amounted to 5 or 6 boxes of
material.
The files include 'things rounded up during the campaign, from accountants,
anything that (Clinton's lawyer) thinks is relevant,' as well as documents
discovered in deputy White House counsel Mr Vincent Foster's office after
his suicide on July 20, she told reporters.
Mr Newt Gingrich, number-two Republican in the House, yesterday called the
way the documents were supplied to the Justice Department 'very, very
disturbing.'
Republicans have been calling for an independent counsel to investigate
Clinton's dealings over Whitewater.
The Clintons deny any wrongdoing.
