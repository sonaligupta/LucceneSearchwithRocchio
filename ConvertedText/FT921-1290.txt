FT  25 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Shandwick Pounds 1.4m in the red


   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent


SHANDWICK, the public relations company, yesterday , reported a pre-tax loss
of Pounds 1.4m for the 15 months to October 31, slightly worse than
analysts' forecasts. For the 12 months to July 31 1990 there were pre-tax
profits of Pounds 21m
Turnover advanced to Pounds 198m (Pounds 163m) while operating profits
dropped to Pounds 14.4m (Pounds 24.8m) and losses per share were 8.9p
(earnings 18p).
Shandwick also announced a number of board changes. Mr Peter Gummer remains
as chairman and additionally takes over as chief executive from Mr Antony
Stoddard, who has resigned. Mr Stoddard will act as consultant for 12
months.
Mr Gummer, together with Mr John Huckle, finance director, and Mr Dermot
McNulty, chief operating officer who is now appointed a director, will form
the executive committee of the board. Mr Gummer will relinquish the chief
executive post in due course while remaining executive chairman.
The City was forewarned of likely losses by Mr Gummer last December, when
Shandwick's share price collapsed from 125p to 52 1/2 p. Since then it has
fallen further, closing yesterday at 29p. Analysts had been forecasting
pre-tax profits of between Pounds 10m and Pounds 14m for 1992.
Mr Gummer pointed to the Gulf war and recession as the causes of Shandwick's
profits' collapse. He said action had been taken to cut overheads. Staff -
50 per cent of the company's costs - had been reduced from 2,150 to 1,950.
Exceptional provisions of Pounds 9.3m covered severance and closure costs,
delayed and cancelled contracts and abortive acquisitions and joint
ventures. In October, net debt stood at Pounds 50m and has since increased
to Pounds 56m.
Shandwick had delayed announcing the results to finalise new banking
arrangements. Mr Gummer said the company had achieved an additional Pounds
5m facility, making Pounds 65m in total.
A proposed final dividend of 1.18p makes a total of 3.54p for the 15-month
period (3.5p).
