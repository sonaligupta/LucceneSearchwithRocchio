FT  08 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Gartmore


UK pension fund managers are more international in outlook than their peers
in other countries, as shown by the relatively high weighting they give to
non-domestic assets in their investment portfolios. But UK fund managers
suffer from parochialism insofar as the money they manage originates
overwhelmingly from the UK. The fiercely competitive UK market looks
increasingly ex-growth.
Gartmore's joint venture with NationsBank of the US is a smart answer to the
strategic challenge. It involves minimal initial outlay by either party and
is unlikely to make a contribution to Gartmore's earnings before 1996.
Nevertheless the deal promises to insulate Gartmore from further stagnation
in the UK. At the same time, it gives the UK group access to the US market,
where the share of pension fund money invested outside the US is set to rise
from 3.0 per cent to 11.5 per cent over the decade to 1998. Alone, Gartmore
could have hoped to have gained a modest share of this business. The
alliance with NationsBank brings together the US bank's distribution muscle
with Gartmore's investment expertise. As a result the joint venture's target
of managing Dollars 5bn of US money within five years looks attainable.
If so, the impact on Gartmore's profits will be substantial - and the 10 per
cent of Gartmore sold to NationsBank a price worth paying. The move will put
pressure on other UK fund managers to find partnerships.
