FT  02 JUL 92 / International Company News: Hitachi and IBM reach computer
printer deal

INTERNATIONAL Business Machines (IBM), the US computer company, and Hitachi,
the Japanese electrical machinery maker, have reached agreement on joint
development of computer printers for business use, the two companies said
yesterday.
Details of a final deal are being negotiated between Hitachi Koki, part of
the Hitachi group, and Pennant Systems, an IBM subsidiary responsible for
developing, manufacturing and marketing printers which was created during
the restructuring of the US company last year.
The latest deal between the two will lead to their first joint development
of printers, although Hitachi already supplies Pennant with the core engine
for its systems printers.
The aim of the agreement will be to reduce product development costs, as
well as to expand marketing channels for jointly-made products.
The office printer market is undergoing a shift away from large, centralised
printing systems to smaller, departmental systems which are cheaper andmore
flexible with more features. It is also becoming increasingly price-driven,
according to BIS Strategic Decisions, the high-technology market
consultancy.
IBM, a market leader for systems printers, is also a dominant player in the
centralised systems market which is being eroded by this trend.
Hitachi has considerable expertise in the manufacture of printer engines,
but mostly sells printers on an original equipment manufacture (OEM) basis.
