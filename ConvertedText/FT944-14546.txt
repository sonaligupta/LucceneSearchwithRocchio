FT  22 OCT 94 / Consumer spending on credit and debit cards down in
September


   By PHILIP COGGAN


Consumer spending on credit and debit cards fell in September, according to
figures released by the Credit Card Research Group yesterday, but the
decline was mainly due to seasonal factors, Philip Coggan writes.
The group said that card spending dropped from Pounds 5.02bn in August to
Pounds 4.68bn in September, although the August figures had been boosted by
bank holiday spending.
Figures for September's retail sales, published earlier this week, showed a
0.5 per cent monthly rise. The retail sales statistics are expressed in
volume terms and are seasonally adjusted.
Credit and debit card spending in 1994 has been substantially higher than in
1993, partly due to the growing use of cards as a method of payment. In the
three months to September, card spending was 17 per cent higher than in the
same period in 1993. Figures from the British Bankers Association and the
Central Statistical Office have also shown strength in personal sector
borrowing.
Over the past year, card spending has grown at a quicker rate among hotels,
the food and drink sector and other retailers. The slowest growth has been
in the entertainment sector. Debit card spending has grown faster than that
for credit cards, with the bulk of debit card spending occurring in
supermarkets and off-licences.
