FT  27 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow registers solid gains
after slow start

Wall Street
After a slow start, US share prices posted solid gains yesterday, aided by a
strong showing from Procter & Gamble and heavy demand for transportation
stocks, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 36.47 at 3,244.11,
having spent all but the last two hours of the day only a few points above
opening values. The more broadly based Standard & Poor's 500 finished 4.07
higher at 418.17, while the Amex composite closed up 1.92 at 376.16 and the
Nasdaq composite 1.61 higher at 598.91. Turnover on the NYSE was lighter
than in recent days at 188m shares.
Over the past week the markets have been busy and trading heavy as investors
repositioned their portfolios ahead of the November 3 election. That phase
appears to be over, and analysts said a new period of consolidation and
caution was likely to follow, with more investors moving to the sidelines as
election day nears.
The latest opinion polls, which showed Governor Bill Clinton's lead
narrowing after a surge in support for Mr Ross Perot, may have contributed
to yesterday's late gains, forcing those investors who had bet on a Clinton
victory to readjust their positions.
The absence of fresh economic news figures and the fact that the reporting
season is drawing to a close meant that trading was light compared to recent
weeks.
Among individual stocks, Procter & Gamble jumped Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 53
1/2 in heavy trading after the consumer products group announced an 18 per
cent rise in first quarter net income to Dollars 631m before a special
Dollars 200m reserve related to the divestiture of its juice business.
General Motors firmed Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 34 1/2 in turnover of 2.8m
after Mr Robert Stempel, the chairman, announced his resignation. His
departure had been widely predicted, but the company did not immediately
name a new chairman.
The other two car manufacturers were both firmer, buoyed up by recent good
sales figures. Chrysler put on Dollars 1 to Dollars 26 7/8 , and Ford firmed
Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 40 1/8 .
Paramount Communications fell Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 43 1/4 in active
trading after securities house Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock on concern
about entertainment group's the short-term earnings outlook. Phillips
Petroleum firmed Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 25 5/8 after reporting third
quarter net income of 38 cents a share.
On the Nasdaq market, Somatix rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 7 3/4 after an
analyst at broking house Oppenheimer said that the company should benefit
from gene therapy that could possibly become commercially viable next year.
Radius dropped Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 5 on disappointing fiscal fourth
quarter earnings.

TORONTO stocks ended higher in active trading boosted by several blocks of
Sceptre Resources shares. According to preliminary data, the 300 Index
gained 29.23 points, or 0.90 per cent, to 3,275.99. Advances led declines
253 to 241.
Volume of 39.2m shares was above Friday's 30.7m, and trading value was
CDollars 244m against the previous CDollars 290.6m.
Monday's volume included three block trades in Sceptre Resources totalling
about 9m shares. In all, about 10.6m Sceptre shares changed hands.
