FT  29 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Honeysuckle climbs 8%


HONEYSUCKLE Group, the USM-quoted designer of women's wear, reported an 8
per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 720,435 to Pounds 781,586 for
the year to May 31.
The improvement came from turnover up by Pounds 2m to Pounds 15.8m. Earnings
came out at 6.9p (6.3p) and an increased final dividend of 1.5p is proposed,
making a 2.25p (1p) total.
Mr David Serr, chairman, said growth in business was encouraging, if patchy,
and an extremely healthy start to the winter season had been only slightly
tempered by a recent slowdown in the retail sector.
The chairman added that orders for spring 1994 had exceeded expectations and
he was, again, projecting increased turnover and profits.
