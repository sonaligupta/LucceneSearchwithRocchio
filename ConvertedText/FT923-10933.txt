FT  28 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Nu-Swift drops to Pounds 20m


   By ANDREW BOLGER


NU-SWIFT, the fire protection, office cleaning and property group, reported
a fall in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 32.6m to Pounds 20.2m, in the year to
December 31.
Turnover fell to Pounds 326m (Pounds 342m). The company said its businesses
had suffered from difficult conditions in the UK and US, but costs had been
closely controlled and operating profits were reasonable.
The office cleaning and maintenance division had found trading conditions
difficult in the US,but improved efficiency and reduced costs meant results
in the first quarter of 1992 were 21 per cent ahead.
Following the disposal in 1990 of its holding in Sicli, the French fire
extinguisher company, Nu-Swift invested Pounds 49m in property which,
together with non-recourse borrowings of Pounds 78m, enabled it to acquire a
property portfolio, mainly offices in central London.
Earnings per share fell from 45.36p to 34.74p. A same-again final dividend
of 10p is proposed, to make an increased total of 20p (18p).
