FT  29 APR 94 / Turks seek to reassure creditors


   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN


   ISTANBUL


Turkish central bankers will today meet foreign creditors to explain
government plans for restructuring three Turkish banks which closed this
month. One foreign economist estimated the total foreign liabilities of the
three banks - Turkish Turizm ve Yatirim Bank, Marmara Bank and Impexbank -
at Dollars 200m. The banks' creditors are understood to include French,
German, US and Swiss banks. Turkish newspapers reported that the main
creditors were UBS and SBC of Switzerland. In the event of liquidation of
the three banks, domestic depositors are likely to have first call on the
banks' assets. A ceiling of TL150m (Pounds 3,240), raised from TL50m, has
been set as the amount payable to individual depositors.
Turkey will want to reassure foreign creditors, on the eve of talks with the
International Monetary Fund which start today. The talks are aimed at
winning Fund approval for Turkey's austerity programme, to pave the way for
Turkey to return to the commercial debt markets.
