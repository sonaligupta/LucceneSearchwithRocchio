FT  16 MAR 94 / Colombian army 'caused deaths'


   By STEPHEN FIDLER


Amnesty International, the London-based human rights organisation, yesterday
accused the Colombian armed forces and related paramilitary groups of
responsibility for most of the 20,000 political killings in the country
since 1985, writes Stephen Fidler.
Amnesty said governments had escaped international criticism in part by
hiding behind a public relations smokescreen, which portrayed a 'myth' that
drug traffickers and guerrillas were mainly to blame.
