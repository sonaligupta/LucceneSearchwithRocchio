FT  08 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Shake-up continues at New London


The reorganisation of New London, the oil industry services company,
continues with the announcement of a disposal, acquisition and results
showing reduced losses from continuing businesses.
The company is selling Well Solutions, its Texas-based energy industry
services supplier, for Dollars 16m (Pounds 9.7m) in cash and Dollars 1.5m in
convertible loan stock. Mr Paul Kesterton, chief executive, said the
proceeds would be used to buy International Tool & Supply for an initial sum
of Dollars 5.75m in cash and the issue of 20m new shares.
ITS operates a variety of international businesses serving the energy
industry, from distribution and procurement to designing and manufacturing
steam generators, and supplying products for the containment of oil spills.
The acquisition agreement included further payments in cash and shares,
contingent on ITS meeting certain profit targets.
New London also announced interim pre-tax profits of Dollars 685,000,
against a loss of Dollars 1.38m last time. Profits were helped by an Dollars
845,000 gain on the termination of discontinued operations. Sales fell from
Dollars 58.4m to Dollars 12.2m due to the sale of International Drilling
Fluids last year. Excluding IDF, sales rose from Dollars 11.8m.
Earnings per share were 0.6 cents (1.2 cents losses). There is no dividend.
The shares were suspended at 4p pending shareholder approval of the disposal
and acquisition on November 29. Dealings are expected to resume on December
1.
