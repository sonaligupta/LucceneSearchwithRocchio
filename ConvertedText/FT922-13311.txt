FT  13 APR 92 / Creation of Edinburgh as 'second capital' urged


EDINBURGH should become Britain's second capital and government departments
should be moved to Scotland, according to the Institute of Economic Affairs,
the rightwing think tank.
Professor Christie Davies, Professor of Sociology at Reading University,
says the creation of a second capital would create jobs and aid development
in Scotland and halt moves towards political independence.
Making Edinburgh a second capital would 'siphon off some of the excessive
development of the south-east and channel it to Scotland,' he says in an
article in Economic Affairs, the institute journal.
'An all-British presence in Scotland would provide Scotland with far more
jobs and a far greater sense of national importance than a regional assembly
or a Caledonian government ever could.'
Prof Davies warns that if Scotland became independent it would fall 'into
the kind of hopeless poverty that afflicts all the small countries on the
fringe of the European Community'.
