FT  16 NOV 93 / International Company News: Sumitomo Realty tumbles 31%


   By ROBERT THOMSON


   TOKYO


SUMITOMO Realty and Development, the Tokyo-based property developer,
suffered a 31.5 per cent fall in pre-tax profit to Y5.1bn (Dollars 48m) for
the first half, despite a 47 per cent increase in sales during the period.
The sales figure of Y190bn was boosted by sales of its land holdings,
intended to reduce the company's debt and to assist in covering losses
incurred by a finance subsidiary which is under reconstruction.
Eight commercial buildings were completed during the period, and another 11
are scheduled to be finished in the second half, putting pressure on
Sumitomo to find tenants in a weak property market.
Sumitomo officials estimated yesterday that the company's 147 buildings had
a vacancy rate of 10 per cent, compared to 7 per cent in March. It sold 368
apartments in the first half, and hopes to sell more than double that figure
during the second half.
Demand for residential apartments in Tokyo has recovered this year, after
three years of decline, but the vacancy rate for commercial space is
continuing to rise. In areas rapidly developed during the bubble years of
the late 1980s, the vacancy rate is as high as 50 per cent.
But developers which purchased land at the price peak in 1990 have been
under pressure to complete projects to ensure a return on their initial
investment, creating a continuing flow of building completions and
increasing the pressure on commercial rents.
