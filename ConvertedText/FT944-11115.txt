FT  08 NOV 94 / Machine tool industry in surplus


   By ANDREW BAXTER


The machine-tool industry recorded a trade surplus of Pounds 5.7m in the
first half of the year compared with a deficit of Pounds 7.7m a year
earlier, according to the Machine Tool Technologies Association, Andrew
Baxter writes.
The turnround continues the improved performance in the second half of last
year, which enabled the industry to achieve a trade surplus of Pounds 9m for
1993 - its first for 10 years.
In the first half of this year machine-tool exports rose 18.6 per cent to
Pounds 174.5m, due mainly to sales growth in the US and Far East.
Continental Europe remained relatively weak, although there were signs of
recovery, the association said.
Imports of machine tools rose 9 per cent to Pounds 168.7m, reflecting
improved manufacturing investment.
