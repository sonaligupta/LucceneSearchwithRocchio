FT  21 DEC 92 / Corporate 'bullying' case sent to DTI


   By ALISON SMITH


ALLEGATIONS that a large company has engaged in 'corporate bullying' have
been passed to the Department of Trade and Industry, giving ministers a rare
opportunity to take up a case where a small company feels unfairly treated.
The DTI believes that the fact that a copy of the material was sent to it
represents a step forward in its efforts to go into battle on behalf of
small businesses. In many cases, small companies are reluctant to complain
about their dealings with large companies, for fear that they will lose
business.
The letter given to the DTI is from a large company to one of its suppliers.
The large company asks its supplier for help in dealing with the difficulty
that prices for goods delivered for Christmas were set in the summer and so
were unable to take account of the impact on import prices of sterling's
devaluation after leaving the European exchange rate mechanism.
Explaining that it cannot absorb the sudden cost increase alone, the large
company seeks a 'contribution' to 'ensure a continued place for you as a
supplier'. A deduction would be made from the next payment to the supplier
company.
The DTI is conscious that some small businesses are unable to reject such
pressure. It believes, however, that legislation is not the answer because
companies might shrink from pursuing through the courts a matter so critical
to a commercial relationship.
Baroness Denton, minister responsible for small businesses, yesterday urged
small companies to present examples of when they had been badly treated by
larger companies, and promised to raise them with the other parties.
'This is more evidence that small firms are under the greatest pressure,'
she said. 'The future of this country's economy depends on the relationship
between small firms and large firms. Small and medium-sized firms are the
answer for employment.'
