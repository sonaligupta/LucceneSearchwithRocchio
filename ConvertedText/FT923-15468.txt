FT  02 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Turning off the tap


The resounding flop of the public half of The Telegraph's flotation raises
the question of whether UK corporations can still look to the equity market
as a source of funds. The Telegraph may be a special case, having suffered
unfairly from renewed publicity over the Mirror float. GPA may have been
special too, by virtue of the complexity of its business. But one scarcely
envies the advisers to MFI and Wellcome, or indeed to any company
contemplating a big rights issue.
It is not as if the Telegraph flop can be put down simply to a falling
market. Between the pricing of the issue and yesterday's close of the offer,
the FT-SE had fallen by only around 30 points. Nor is it a question of the
UK market being short of cash. Last week's gilts issue - the biggest in the
market's history - was swallowed readily enough by the domestic
institutions.
The real problem may simply be that in a period of terminal gloom about the
UK economy, investors have given up thoughts of capital gain and are
interested solely in security of income. This could prove a temporary phase
as the markets adjust to a new world of low inflation. But the companies
which offer such security - the utilities, for instance - are precisely
those which do not need cash in the first place. As with individuals, so
with corporations: those who were seduced into borrowing in the late 1980s
are perhaps being left to find their own salvation.
