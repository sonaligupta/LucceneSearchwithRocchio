FT  12 MAR 93 / US decision to undertake airdrop of humanitarian supplies
praised by UN high commissioner for refugees


   By MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS


MRS SADAKO OGATA, United Nations high commissioner for refugees, yesterday
praised the US decision to undertake an airdrop of humanitarian supplies in
eastern Bosnia, saying it was relieving much suffering, writes Michael
Littlejohns.
But in a closed-door briefing for the UN Security Council, she emphasised
that the operation could never be a substitute for land convoys, which still
constituted her agency's first priority. During the past few weeks lack of
land access had resulted in a 50 per cent reduction in food aid, previously
running at 8,000 tonnes a week.
Mrs Ogata will have talks in Washington with the Clinton administration
today.
