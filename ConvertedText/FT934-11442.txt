FT  01 NOV 93 / British Steel in Indiana contract


   By ANDREW BAXTER


BRITISH STEEL has won its first overseas contract for a pioneering
technology that reduces the amount of coke needed in blast furnaces, writes
Andrew Baxter.
Bethlehem Steel, one of the largest US steelmakers, is to install a system
for injecting granular coal into the two blast furnaces at its Burns Harbor
plant in Indiana.
The technology has been in use at British Steel's Scunthorpe works for about
10 years. Cokemaking is a capital-intensive and environmentally sensitive
process, but granular injection reduces the amount of coke required for
iron-making by up to 40 per cent.
Simon Macawber, the Doncaster iron and steelmaking equipment supplier, will
make and install the equipment at Burns Harbor. British Steel will provide
training, operating and technical assistance in the early production phase
and will receive royalties.
