South Korean companies issued Won491bn in convertible bonds in the first
quarter of this year, against Won398.2bn for all of 1993, the Securities
Supervisory Board said, Reuter reports from Seoul. In 1992, they issued
Won146bn in convertible bonds.
In April, South Korean companies planned to issue convertible bonds
totalling Won298bn, which will bring the four-month aggregate to Won789bn,
an official said. Analysts expect such issues to total between Won2,000bn
and Won 3,000bn for all of 1994.
The bonds are favoured by domestic companies keen to cut costs, as they
normally carry lower interest rates than corporate bonds.
Foreigners will be allowed to buy some convertible bonds from around June.
