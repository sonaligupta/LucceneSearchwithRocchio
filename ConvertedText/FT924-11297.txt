FT  27 OCT 92 / Bosnia's military commanders meet face-to-face

   SARAJEVO


Military commanders of Bosnia's three warring sides met face-to-face across
a negotiating table yesterday while their troops fought on throughout the
former Yugoslav republic, Reuter reports from Sarajevo.
Leaders of Serb, Moslem and Croat forces met at Sarajevo's shell-battered
airport for a closed door meeting chaired by the United Nations
peace-keeping force commander. It was the second encounter between the three
sides organised by the UN.
The leaders were expected to discuss practical ways of ensuring water and
electricity to the Bosnian capital, which has been surrounded by Serb
fighters since April. UN officials have called the talks a breakthrough. But
there was no visible effect on fighting in Sarajevo or other towns.
Heavy shelling rocked the capital's western suburb of Stup around midday and
mortars rained into a district near the UN headquarters, wounding five.
