FT  26 MAY 93 / Asia energy needs double

MR Daniel Ritchie, director of the World Bank's Asia technical department,
said yesterday that soaring economic growth rates in Asia meant that the
region's energy needs would double during the 1990s.
Speaking at a Financial Times Asian Electricity conference in Singapore, Mr
Ritchie said additional power capacity of between 125,000MW and 160,000MW
was needed in Asia by the year 2000 - costing a total of between Dollars
400bn and Dollars 500bn (Pounds 260bn and Pounds 326bn).
He said the private sector needed to become more involved in investing in
Asia's power sector as traditional ways of financing power projects -
through government funding or publicly guaranteed funds - were no longer
practical. So far only 10 power projects in the region have private sector
participation.
Representatives of several countries in the region outlined ambitious power
expansion plans. Mr Tajol Rosli Gazali, Malaysia's deputy energy minister,
said Malaysia now had an installed capacity of 4,890MW.
With an economy forecast to grow at an annual rate of 7 per cent over the
next 25 years, power demand would rise to 9,500MW by the year 2000 and more
than 29,000MW by 2015. Mr Tajol said that MDollars 100bn (Pounds 25bn) would
be needed over 30 years to implement such a power expansion programme.
Dr Pham Khanh Toan of Vietnam's Ministry of Energy said that the country's
energy consumption per capita was now one of the world's lowest.
He said a large-scale power expansion programme was urgently needed. Without
a growth in power output the Vietnamese economy could not expand. 'We
calculate that we will need between Dollars 20bn and Dollars 30bn in
investment in the power sector between now and the end of the century,' said
Dr Toan.
Speakers from Thailand, South Korea and the Philippines also outlined plans
to carry out large-scale expansion projects in the near future.
