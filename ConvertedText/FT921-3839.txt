FT  12 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris runs into profit-taking
as Continent falls mildly


   By Our Markets Staff and HILARY BARNES


DECLINES described as profit-taking in Paris, and consolidation in Frankfurt
left bourses looking mildly, but not seriously depressed yesterday, writes
Our Markets Staff.
PARIS dealers said that there was no evidence of heavy selling pressure. The
CAC 40 index closed at 1968.02, down 25.86 or 1.3 per cent, in turnover of
FFr2.3bn.
Euro Disney slipped 70 centimes to FFr163.60 and LVMH fell FFr142 or 2.9 per
cent to FFr4,670 as investors locked in recent gains.
Two-way business was reported in Chargeurs and Perrier. Chargeurs rose FFr12
to FFr1,230 ahead of its 1991 results which were released after the close; a
provision brought net profits well below analysts' forecasts.
Perrier, the market's potboiler, rose FFr25 or 1.6 per cent to FFr1,630
after Nestle said it would decide within a week whether to raise its bid for
the mineral water company. News that Arab Banking Corp now had a 3.5 per
cent stake in Perrier added to the takeover speculation.
Saint-Gobain fell FFr8 to FFr525. Nikko's Mr Michael Woodcock said that the
company told him during a visit this week that it had no evidence of a
pick-up in the US economy and that it was too early to buy its shares on
recovery hopes.
FRANKFURT warmed, relatively speaking, to the maintained dividend and
miniscule drop in profits at Bayer, after dividend cuts and fourth quarter
setbacks for BASF and Hoechst. Bayer shares, down DM3.70 to DM291.50 ahead
of the news, closed only DM1.20 lower at DM294.
Other blue chips, too, were mainly a shade lower as German equity markets
eased in thin to moderate trading. The DAX index lost 7.12 to 1,743.42 after
a 3.29 fall to 708.23 in the FAZ at midsession. However, Deutsche Babcock,
the engineer, ended DM6.90 higher at DM181.90 as its results swung back into
the black. Turnover fell from DM5.9bn to DM5.3bn.
MILAN rose in technical trading as dealers covered short positions in core
stocks ahead of the expiry of monthly options contracts today and the close
of the March trading account on Monday. The Comit index rose 1.97 to 514.70
in turnover estimated at L90bn after L70bn.
Among industrials, Fiat rose L70 to L4,895 and the tyre and cable maker
Pirelli was up L29 to L1,149. Generali led insurers higher with a L345
rebound to L30,000 on its 1991 results. Fondiaria rose L120 to L33,510.
A 20 per cent rise in 1991 net profit and a rise in the dividend also gave a
boost to Ambroveneto which rose L130 or 3.4 per cent to L3,960.
Telecoms bucked the trend on foreign selling, with Sip losing L16 to L1,347
and Stet down L26 to L2,255.
Bonifiche Siele continued to lose ground, falling L1,900 to L27,100. But BNA
ordinary shares lost only L1 to L5,169.
ZURICH's SPI index fell 7.7 to 1,127.8 as high money market rates drove
potential buyers out of the market and triggered profit-taking by others.
However, a buy recommendation helped bearers in the armaments and
engineering group, Oerlikon-Buhrle, which rose SFr22 to SFr402 in unusually
active trading which pushed them to number two on the active stocks list.
AMSTERDAM was depressed by London and a weaker opening on Wall Street. The
CBS Tendency Index eased 0.9 to 126.9 in turnover of Fl 571.4m.
The brewer Grolsch rose Fl 3 to an all-time high of Fl 207.00 after news of
a 10.6 per cent rise in 1991 net profit. But the electronics group Getronics
lost Fl 1.20 to Fl 33.60 after the company issued a cautious statement on
the outlook for this year.
Scandinavia was mixed. STOCKHOLM ended a ten-day uptrend as the
Affarsvarlden General index fell 5.5 to 986.0. Stora B fell SKr6 to SKr268
in a weak forestry sector, as the company's net profits fell 61 per cent and
the chairman and his deputy resigned.
In COPENHAGEN, writes Hilary Barnes, the pharmaceutical group Novo Nordisk
fell DKr4 to DKr530 in spite of a 22 per cent advance in profits while
Carlsberg, the brewer, saw its B shares down DKr7 to DKr322 following the UK
monopolies referral of the Carlsberg-Allied Lyons tie-up in Britain. The CSE
index was off 0.55 at 344.76 in moderate turnover of DKr291m.
However, HELSINKI extended its recovery to a second day as the Hex index
rose 11.4 to 878.3. OSLO closed slightly higher on Wednesday, helped by a
better-than-expected 1991 result from the insurer UNI Storebrand. The
all-share index rose 2.86 to 423.42 in moderate turnover of NKr212.64m,
while UNI Storebrand saw its ordinary shares add NKr2.50 to NKr49.50.
ISTANBUL rose 2.5 per cent on late buying, the market index closing 93.29
higher at 3,813.45.
