FT  22 DEC 92 / Palestinian deportees come under militia fire

TWO Palestinians were wounded yesterday when Israeli-backed militiamen fired
warning shots to stop about 415 deportees stranded in a Middle East no-man's
land from re-entering Israeli-held territory.
As the deadlock between Lebanon and Israel over the fate of the deportees
continued, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, told parliament in
Jerusalem his government was firm in its resolve not to let them return. 'I
confess there is no pity for them in my heart,' he said.
In Beirut, the Lebanese government repeated that it was not responsible for
the expelled Palestinians. And Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri told
humanitarian organisations they could no longer provide emergency aid.
The Israeli High Court adjourned until today its consideration of a petition
by civil rights lawyers to force the government to rescind the deportations.
In the US, General Colin Powell, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff,
added his voice to the US administration's criticism of the expulsions.
'Counterviolence and deportations are not the answer we need to Israel's
legitimate security needs,' General Powell told a Jewish audience at Yeshiva
University in New York.
Earlier, the deportees, expelled last week for their alleged links to
Islamic fundamentalist groups which had shot dead six Israeli soldiers, were
ordered by Lebanese troops to leave their makeshift camp in no-man's land in
south-eastern Lebanon and return southwards to Israeli-controlled territory.
Reporters at the scene said the South Lebanon Army, which is armed and
controlled by Israel, twice opened fire around the deportees and over their
heads with tank shells, mortars and heavy machineguns when they came within
several hundred yards of SLA positions at Zemraya on the edge of Israel's
Lebanese 'security zone'.
At nightfall, the deportees were said to have moved back towards their tent
encampment in the area between the Israeli and Lebanese armies to spend a
fifth successive night. The SLA planted mines to prevent another attempted
crossing and received water cannon and teargas.
Mr Rabin told the Knesset he would not be swayed by what he said was an
attempt to prove 'that these terrorists are unprotected and should be
pitied.' He said the expulsions were part of a fight against Islamic
extremists pledged to destroy the Middle East peace process.
Mr Rabin said he was convinced the peace negotiations would resume, despite
a suspension of the talks by the Palestine Liberation Organisation. But the
head of the Palestinian delegation to the talks, Mr Faisal Husseini, said
the immediate issue was securing the return of the deportees, not setting a
date for renewed talks.
