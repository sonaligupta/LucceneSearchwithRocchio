FT  02 NOV 93 / US nuclear fuel move may threaten Dounreay plant


   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent


MOVES by the US government to persuade Belgium not to send spent nuclear
fuel for reprocessing in Britain are causing alarm at the UK Atomic Energy
Authority's plant at Dounreay in Caithness, which sees the US action as a
serious threat to its reprocessing operation.
Dounreay has a contract worth about Pounds 3m with a Belgian research
nuclear reactor to take 144 rods of spent fuel and reprocess them,
separating uranium from other waste and returning it all to Belgium.
But the US Department of Energy is understood to have offered the Belgian
authorities a highly advantageous price for taking the spent fuel and
storing it in South Carolina. It is also believed to have offered to
indemnify the Belgians against legal action from Dounreay for breach of
contract.
In order to allow the speedy import of the spent fuel into the US, the US
Energy Department has waived the rule requiring an environmental impact
study to be carried out before it can be imported.
The Dounreay plant, where the experimental fast-breeder reactor is due to
close next year, is concerned that the US could make similar moves with
other consignments of spent nuclear fuel in Europe, wiping out Dounreay's
reprocessing business.
It hopes to win a contract to reprocess a further 500 rods from Belgium,
giving it a total of Pounds 15m-worth of business. It now fears it might
have to close the reprocessing plant with the loss of 40 jobs.
The Clinton administration opposes reprocessing because it increases the
stock of weapons-grade uranium.
The Studiekentrum voor Kernenergie, which operates the BR2 reactor at Moll
in Belgium, is close to deciding whether to accept the US offer, which is
understood to involve a price of about Dollars 4,000 (Pounds 2,700) per rod
compared with the Dollars 20,000 cost of reprocessing it.
