FT  29 APR 94 / UK Company News: Usborne offer could end its suspension


   By ANDREW BOLGER


Usborne, the grain trading and pig production company, said an offer had
been made for control of the company and that its shares could return from
suspension next month.
Shares in Usborne were suspended earlier this month at 19 1/2 p after the
group warned of substantial interim losses following problems on the pig
production side.
The group said yesterday that it had been informed that Mr David Frame, it
chief executive, had agreed to sell a 36 per cent stake in the company for
5p a share to a major shareholder, Mr David Thompson. This would give Mr
Thompson's company, Thompson Investments, control of just over 50 per cent
of Usborne's equity.
Following completion of his purchase of Mr Frame's shares, expected within
the next seven days, Mr Thompson will make an unconditional cash offer at
not less than 5p per share for all the outstanding shares, and loan the
group Pounds 10m to support the company's trading.
The board said it welcomed the financial commitment which Thompson
Investments had made to Usborne.
The interim results would be published as soon as practicable.
In the meantime, shareholders were advised to take no action until the
interim results have been released and the board has expressed its view on
forthcoming offer.
