FT  21 APR 94 / Smith slams 'electoral pacts'


   By DAVID OWEN


A row over electoral pacts broke out yesterday after Mr John Smith accused
the Conservatives of standing down local election candidates in four London
boroughs to squeeze out Labour and improve the Liberal Democrats' chances of
winning.
The Labour leader told an election rally in London last night that there was
evidence of 'a number of electoral pacts' between the other two leading
parties.
He said Tory candidates were standing down to give Liberal Democrats 'a free
run' in Barking, Haringey, Waltham Forest and Tower Hamlets.
'People in London should know that if they vote Liberal they may well be
supporting John Major by the back door.'
The Labour leader's claims were rejected as 'complete nonsense' by the
Liberal Democrats. There were 'at least nine councils where Labour and the
Conservatives were in cahoots', the party added.
Mr Smith said that Labour was putting forward candidates in all 1,917 seats
up for election in the capital. This was 75 more than the Tories and 308
more than the Liberal Democrats.
The Labour leader's speech followed hard on the heels of a Westminster press
conference at which leading Conservatives attacked Liberal Democrat policies
in London.
Meanwhile Sir Norman Fowler, the Tory chairman, targeted the Pounds 1.25m
advertising campaign being run by Unison, Britain's largest union, in
advance of the May 5 elections, branding it 'a shameful example of money
being spent to buy influence'. He said Labour gave Unison two 'pay-offs' in
return for the 'backdoor subsidy' to its campaign: 'a massive number of
votes at the Labour party conference' and 'a promise of a national statutory
minimum wage'.
