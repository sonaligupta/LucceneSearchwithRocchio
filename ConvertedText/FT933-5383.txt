FT  03 SEP 93 / Driven by the need to survive: Kevin Done and John Ridding
on the forces behind the Renault-Volvo merger


   By KEVIN DONE and JOHN RIDDING


AFTER three years of living together, Renault and Volvo are preparing to go
to the altar. The final touches are being applied this weekend to a
full-scale merger.
The deal sets a new high-water mark in the shake-out of the European motor
industry, as the continent's dwindling band of vehicle makers seek a place
among the survivors in the global industry of the next century.
Europe has become the central battle-ground of the world auto industry, as
the Japanese car makers follow their dramatic incursion into North America
during the 1980s, by building another regional production base in Europe
during the 1990s.
At the same time European car makers are under intense pressure to put their
houses in order before the expiry of the transitional period to a free car
market by the end of 1999, when all restrictions on Japanese car and light
commercial vehicle imports are supposed to be removed.
The Renault-Volvo merger moves the restructuring of the European auto
industry on to a new plane and is the first of the jumbo marriages.
Restructuring along national lines was completed long ago. The smaller
producers have nearly all been picked off: in cars, Jaguar by Ford, Saab by
General Motors, Seat and Skoda by Volkswagen and Alfa Romeo by Fiat; in
trucks, Pegaso and Ford Trucks by Iveco, Steyr by MAN, Leyland by Daf.
The new Renault-Volvo group will have a combined turnover of about Dollars
41bn. In the western European car market it will move into fourth place with
a combined share of 12.1 per cent (1992 figures) behind Volkswagen - which
includes Audi, Seat and Skoda - at 17.5 per cent, General Motors
(Opel/Vauxhall and including Saab) at 12.4 per cent and PSA Peugeot-Citroen
at 12.2 per cent. It will leap-frog both Fiat and Ford.
In cars, the impact of the merger will chiefly be felt in Europe. Renault
has long since pulled out of North America with the failure of its venture
with American Motors - it sold its stake to Chrysler in 1987. Volvo has only
0.7 per cent of the US car market.
It is a different story in the commercial vehicle industry, however, where
the merged group will challenge Mercedes-Benz for world leadership in heavy
trucks, where European producers dominate.
Volvo (through Volvo GM Heavy Truck Corporation with its WhiteGMC
brand-name), Renault (through Mack) and Mercedes-Benz (through Freightliner)
all have a substantial presence in the US market, where last year they
accounted for 44 per cent of heavy truck sales.
Volvo is much more the world player than Renault, with substantial
manufacturing operations in South America and a clear sales presence in the
Middle East and Asia.
In the European truck market, Volvo has a more significant presence than
Renault in heavy trucks, but Renault is in all market segments.
Renault-Volvo should move into second place behind Mercedes-Benz and ahead
of Iveco, part of Fiat.
The merger is being driven by an overriding imperative to force down costs.
The investment needed to develop new vehicles is such that only the biggest
battalions appear able to gain the necessary economies of scale. This week
Volvo began the launch of its new flagship heavy truck range, which has
taken seven years and an investment of SKr6.5bn (Pounds 530m) to develop.
The logic of the alliance formed in 1990 always meant that a full merger
would eventually emerge. It is the pace of the deal that has been dictated
by the ferocity of the competitive environment.
Mr Louis Schweitzer, Renault chairman and chief executive, has been
determined to drive the merger through as soon as possible. 'If you stop
moving it is bad, you must keep up the momentum.' he says. 'The advantage of
a complete merger is simplicity and speed. Agreement between two companies
does not go as fast as managing a single group.'
As long as Renault and Volvo have different shareholders there is a basic
problem of how savings and profits - or losses - are to be apportioned
between the two companies. According to Mr Schweitzer, 'it is clear there is
no way back.'
