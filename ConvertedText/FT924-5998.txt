FT  24 NOV 92 / Hong Kong TV maker to set up Tyneside plant


   By CHRIS TIGHE


THE HONG KONG-based Kong Wah consumer electronic and electrical products
group has chosen south Tyneside for its first European plant.
The company said yesterday that the Pounds 10m project would eventually
produce 1,000 wide-screen and digital stereo televisions a day for the
European market. It is to receive Pounds 3.25m in regional selective
assistance from the Department of Trade and Industry and will create 280
jobs.
The Redwood Group, Kong Wah's project manager and adviser, said the company
had decided on the project partly because it was concerned that European
Community quotas under which televisions made elsewhere can be imported
without tariff may be tightened.
This year, tariffs apply once colour television imports from non-Community
countries exceed 650,000 Ecus (Pounds 528,500) in total. The 1993 quota is
under negotiation in Brussels and there is to be a review next year of the
general scheme of preference under which the quotas operate.
European sales account for half the Kong Wah group's turnover - about
Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.6bn) in 1991.
The company, Hong Kong's largest television manufacturer, will start
production in September in a factory to be built in South Shields on land
reclaimed at a cost of almost Pounds 1m by the Tyne and Wear Development
Corporation. The company has started discussions on the UK sourcing of
components.
The project, for which other European locations, particularly France,
competed, qualifies for a European Coal and Steel Community loan. Kong Wah
is investing Pounds 3.25m and the TWDC is providing a Pounds 500,000 grant.
The news is a boost to south Tyneside, where the 18 per cent unemployment
rate is the highest of any English travel-to-work area.
Mr Lam Chung Kui, Kong Wah's chairman, said the north-east was recommended
by companies already there.
