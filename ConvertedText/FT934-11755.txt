FT  29 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Manchester City chief spurns approach


Mr Peter Swales, chairman of Manchester City Football Club, yesterday
dismissed an approach for the Premier League club from a consortium led by
Mr Francis Lee, the former England international.
Speaking at the club's annual meeting, Mr Swales said a proposal from the
consortium was received on Tuesday.
'It contains a number of conditions and does not involve a proposed offer to
all shareholders,' he said.
It fell 'well short' of reflecting the full value of the club, Mr Swales
added.
He reiterated that other parties remained interested.
The club has appointed Henry Ansbacher to 'establish the nature of their
interest'.
