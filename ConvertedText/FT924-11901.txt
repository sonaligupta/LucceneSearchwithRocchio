FT  23 OCT 92 / People: Patience needed for NHS job


Alan Langlands, who joined the National Health Service as a management
trainee in 1974, moves into the high-profile post of deputy chief executive
on January 1.
He will replace Andrew Foster, who has been appointed to head the Audit
Commission following Howard Davies's move to become director-general of the
Confederation of British Industry.
Langlands will deputise for Duncan Nichol, NHS chief executive, and will
head the service's performance management directorate which aims to improve
the quality and cost-effectiveness of health care.
He is currently general manager of North West Thames regional health
authority, one of the four regional authorities responsible for overseeing
health services in London and south-east England, and his new post will be
filled on secondment from the region.
His promotion will put him at one remove from the controversy about to break
out over proposals to close hospitals in the capital.
A graduate of Glasgow University, Langlands, 40, has held a range of other
management posts in the NHS, including manager of London's Middlesex and
University College hospitals. During the late 1980s he had a spell as a
health care management consultant.
The new post will test Langlands' patience with train travel. Arrangements
are in progress to move the head-quarters of the NHS management executive
from London to Leeds, and senior officials are likely to find themselves
spending a good deal of time in transit between the new Yorkshire
headquarters and Whitehall.
