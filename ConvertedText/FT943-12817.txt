FT  22 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Saville Gordon jumps to Pounds 5.6m


   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent


Shares of J Saville Gordon, the property group with merchanting interests,
yesterday rose 5p to 68p following the announcement of more than doubled
pre-tax profits and its first dividend increase for five years.
Pre-tax profits for the year to April 30 advanced from Pounds 2.35m to
Pounds 5.6m.
Earnings per share were 3.9p (1.4p). Although the final dividend was
unchanged at 1.7p, the total for the 12 months was 2.7p, against 2.2p for
the previous four financial years.
Turnover on continuing operations rose to Pounds 30.6m (Pounds 23.1m). The
progress was helped by a rise of nearly Pounds 3m to Pounds 18.7m in sales
of pipeline equipment, the resumption, after a year's absence from the
market, of property trading sales at Pounds 4.19m, and increased property
rental income as rent reviews produced higher revenue.
This year's rental income should be higher following the purchase of a
shopping centre and a portfolio from NFC, while demand is increasing on the
merchanting side.
Net asset value advanced to 58.3p (47.4p).
