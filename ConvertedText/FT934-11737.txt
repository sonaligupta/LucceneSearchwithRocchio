FT  29 OCT 93 / International Company News: Sharp gains at Norwegian insurer


   By KAREN FOSSLI


VITAL Forsikring, one of Norway's top three insurers, yesterday announced a
sharp rise in nine-month value-adjusted pre-tax profit to NKr3.13bn (Dollars
447m) from NKr22m in the same period last year.
The group's free shares rose by NKr4 to NKr90 on the Oslo bourse on the news
as the A-shares added NKr1.50 to NKr70.50. Vital attributed the advance to a
16.5 per cent increase in premium income and gains on securities.
Premium income in the first nine months of this year rose by NKr327m to
NKr3.64bn as gross financial income shot up by NKr2.02bn to NKr3.64bn, of
which NKr1.27bn was due to securities gains. By the end of last month, the
value of the group's securities portfolio had increased by NKr2.09bn to
NKr2.67bn. Insurance payments rose by NKr109m to NKr1.52bn as operating
expenses increased by NKr14m to NKr413m.
'Private market sales were fairly static until the end of summer, but the
September figures show an increasing awareness among the public of the need
for financial security and a good return on savings,' said Mr Bjoern
Elvestad, president.
He added that Vital's performance this year had strengthened the group's
capital base. Group assets increased to NKr40.01bn from NKr34.08bn. Of total
assets, bonds accounted for 44.9 per cent, loans 33.9 per cent, equities 9.3
per cent and real estate 4.2 per cent. Vital's capital adequacy ratio was
put at 9.2 per cent of risk-weighted assets.
Dyno Industrier, the Norwegian chemicals, explosives and plastics group,
said nine-month pretax profits improved to NKr234m from NKr133m in the same
period last year, helped by securities gains and low interest rates.
Group revenue rose by NKr49m to NKr6.07bn due to a stronger dollar and the
addition of businesses since last year.
Operating profit dipped by NKr17m to NKr298m as financial income increased
by NKr45m to NKr168m. Dyno cut financial expenses by NKr59m to NKr245m as
operating expenses rose by NKr442m to NKr5.38bn.
