FT  24 MAR 92 / Money Markets: Rates rise further


CONCERN over the Conservative Party's lag in the opinion polls and the
absence of an anticipated reduction in the February trade deficit helped
push rates up further in a worried market yesterday.
Interbank rates continued to firm, with the key three-month rate up 1/8 from
Friday's close to 10 7/8 -10 13/16 per cent. The six-month rate rose to
11-10 15/16 . The one-year rose as high as 11 3/32 -11 1/32 at one point but
closed back at 11 1/8 -11 per cent.
The June sterling contract opened down two basis points at 88.94 and jumped
to a peak of 89 before dropping slightly to close at 88.97.
The Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 1.4bn in the morning,
principally driven by a fall in treasury bills and maturing assistance, and
in bills for repurchase by the market.
It acted early, purchasing outright Pounds 75m in band 2 at 10 3/8 per cent,
Pounds 11m at 10 7/32 in band 3 and Pounds 3m at 10  3/16 in band 4, as well
as Pounds 1bn for resale to the market on April 3 and 6 at 10 7/16 per cent.
It revised the shortage to Pounds 1.3bn at midday and bought Pounds 206m.
That included Pounds 75m at 10 3/8 in band 1, Pounds 21m at 10 7/32 in band
3 and treasury bills of Pounds 22m at 10 3/16 and another Pounds 88m in
bills in band 4.
The afternoon forecast rose again to Pounds 1.45bn, and it purchased bills
totalling Pounds 155m in band 1 at 10 3/8 per cent. The Bank provided late
assistance of around Pounds 50m.
'The Bank of England was quite keen to be quite helpful,' said one dealer.
Overnight rates fell from 10 3/8 -10 1/4 per cent to 8 1/2 -8 per cent at
lunchtime following the operations from the Bank of England, but rose to 10
3/8 -10 1/4 by the close.
German call rates remained unchanged from Friday at 9.65/70 per cent, near
to the 9.75 per cent Lombard rate. This was in spite of an injection of
short-term funds into the money markets by the Bundesbank during the morning
estimated by one dealer at DM5-6bn.
Mr Peter Luxton, senior economist with Barclays Bank, stressed the
importance of a statement from the South African reserve bank that it would
be prepared to intervene for the first time since 1985.
'This marks a sea change in policy which will inject a degree of stability,'
he said. 'It should encourage foreign investment in what is a very thin
market which can be hugely volatile.'
