FT  30 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Bank warns on deposits


   By ALISON SMITH


THE BANK of England is issuing a leaflet to warn people about the dangers of
putting money into institutions which are not authorised by it to accept
deposits.
Called 'Money in the Bank,' it sets out some signs that should put people on
their guard - such as an offer of unusually high interest rates or an effort
to attract them into making loans to someone's companies.
It also spells out the difference between a deposit, where someone has lent
money and is entitled to have it back in full, and an investment, where
there is no promise to return the money but the lender is entitled to a
share of profits made.
The Bank is at pains to emphasise the lack of protection for someone who has
lost money with an unauthorised deposit-taker, and also the scale of the
problem.
In the cases being investigated by the Bank, up to Pounds 50m could have
been taken in illegal deposits.
'All too often, the losers are elderly and those least able to afford to
take the loss,' Bank officials say. They recall cases of pensioners who had
to return to work after losing money to unauthorised deposit-takers.
Investigations have led Bank officials to carry out interviews in such
unlikely places as London's Wormwood Scrubs prison, a brothel in Toxteth,
Liverpool, and the back seat of a two-door Ford Fiesta.
Over the past year, they have brought three prosecutions for taking
unauthorised deposits, all successful and all resulting in custodial
sentences.
Just under 500,000 leaflets are being printed and will be available from
post offices, Citizens' Advice Bureaux and libraries.
