FT  04 SEP 93 / Hunt may address TUC next year


   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor


MR DAVID HUNT, the employment secretary, is likely to break with political
tradition and address the Trades Union Congress - but not until next year,
according to senior TUC officials.
Mr Hunt, who has gone out of his way to make conciliatory gestures to the
unions, informally sounded out the TUC about addressing this year's
congress, which starts on Monday.
Officials said that his advance was politely rejected but they also made
clear that an invitation for next year was probable.
Mr John Monks, who takes over as the new general-secretary of the TUC next
week, is very keen to distance the union movement from the Labour party and
turn the TUC into a more apolitical organisation.
Mr Monks himself would probably have favoured a signal-setting invitation to
the minister this year but several senior trade union leaders would have
been less keen.
One TUC official said: 'It is a bit premature this year, especially given
that the minister has just steered through an employment law abolishing
wages councils.'
But many union leaders are impressed by Mr Hunt's record of working with
unions in his three years as Welsh secretary and believe he is sincere about
wanting regular contact.
