FT  20 MAY 92 / US 'clarifies' Palestinian refugee stance


   By HUGH CARNEGY

ISRAEL yesterday expressed satisfaction over a statement by the US that a
United Nations resolution asserting the right of return for Palestinian
refugees was not part of the terms of reference for the Middle East peace
negotiations.
The government had pressed Washington for such a public statement after Ms
Margaret Tutwiler, the state department spokeswoman, announced last week
that the US supported UN Security Council Resolution 194, adopted in 1948,
which included the right of return, or compensation, for Palestinian
refugees.
Although not a change in official US policy, Ms Tutwiler's announcement
aroused alarm in Israel. Mr David Levy, the foreign minister, said Ms
Tutwiler's statement amounted to an obstacle to the negotiating process if
it was not 'clarified'.
Ms Tutwiler said on Monday that the only UN resolutions included in the
terms of reference for the peace process were resolutions 242 and 338, which
envisage Israel surrendering Arab territory in exchange for peace and a
'just' - but unspecified - solution for the 2.5m refugees.
