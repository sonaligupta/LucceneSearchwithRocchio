FT  04 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: Abbey National's fixed bond - At a
Glance


Abbey National is launching a five-year fixed-return bond which guarantees a
return of 40 per cent gross or 30 per cent net after five years. This is
equivalent to 6.63 per cent gross per annum, or 5.14 per cent net. The bond
is aimed at people approaching retirement or anyone else expecting to become
a non-tax payer within the next five years, as they will be able to receive
the interest gross when the bond matures. The minimum investment is Pounds
1,000. No interest will be paid on bonds closed before the maturity date of
1 December 1998, and redemption is not possible before December 1995.
