FT  29 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Advances in region as
Nikkei falls by 1.8%


   By EMIKO TERAZONO


   TOKYO


A FALL in East Japan Railway shares depressed sentiment, and prices lost
ground for the third consecutive day, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average declined 359.33, or 1.8 per cent, to 19,479.45. It peaked
at 19,863.09 in the morning session on small-lot purchases by dealers and
institutional investors, but arbitrageurs liquidated positions as the
futures market retreated, and the index dropped to the day's low of
19,443.54 just before the close.
Volume amounted to 220m shares, against Wednesday's 261m. Declines led rises
by 800 to 170, with 153 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first
section stocks shed 29.56 to 1,602.39, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
firmed 2.55 to 1,272.23.
Traders said the absence of public fund buying, which had supported the
Nikkei index around the 20,000 mark, had depressed sentiment. A fall in the
dollar against the yen below the Y108 level also weighed down
export-oriented stocks, which had gained ground on the recent rise in the US
currency.
All trading in JR East was conducted manually, instead of through the
computer system. JR East finished Y75,000 down at Y525,000, although it was
suspended briefly during the morning session due to a lack of sellers.
The decline of JR East prompted selling in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone,
which lost Y18,000 to Y832,000. Traders said margin buyers, who had bought
the stock six months ago and were hoping that the JR East listing would also
help NTT, were forced to liquidate their holdings.
A number of electronics companies announced weak interim results yesterday,
discouraging investors: Toshiba slipped Y4 to Y697 and Hitachi shed Y10 to
Y837. However, Mitsubishi Electric advanced Y8 to Y571 after reporting a
rise in profits because of foreign exchange gains.
In Osaka, the OSE average receded 294.88 to 21,386.36 in volume of 14m
shares. Konami, a discount retailer of men's suits, rose Y150 to Y3,620.
