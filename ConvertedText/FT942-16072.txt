FT  12 APR 94 / International Company News: Seagram expands in Australian
wine deals

Seagram, one of the world's top four drinks groups, is expanding its wine
interests in Australia.
As a first step, Seagram has sold its Saltram Wine Estates, a wine producer
and distributor based in Barossa Valley, South Australia, to Rothbury Wines.
Then Seagram bought treasury shares of Rothbury to hold a 20 per cent
interest and become the largest single stockholder in Rothbury Group. It
will have one representative on the Rothbury board.
Seagram would not reveal prices or other financial details. The two
Australian companies in effect will be merged operationally and expanded.
Seagram has distributed its wine and spirits products in Australian since
1954. It bought Saltram in 1978.
'There are strong synergies between Rothbury and Saltram and joining forces
will create a strong dynamic business,' Seagram said. 'The combined company
will offer a broad Australian wine portfolio as well as other Seagram
wines.'
Analysts said the deal sets Seagram's Asian and global business strategy.
SHL Systemhouse, a fast expanding computer service group, lifted
second-quarter net profit to CDollars 5.4m (USDollars 3.9m) or 10 cents a
share, from CDollars 1.3m, or 3 cents, a year earlier. Revenues gained 22
per cent to CDollars 292m.
First-half revenues rose 27 per cent to CDollars 559m and net profit was
CDollars 10.1m, or 19 cents, against CDollars 1.6m, or 4 cents.
