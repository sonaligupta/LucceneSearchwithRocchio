FT  19 MAY 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report


   By REUTER


TIN prices eased from earlier 18-month peaks during afternoon LME trading,
but still closed higher. Dealers said three-month tin's run-up to a new high
of Dollars 6,265 a tonne largely reflected speculative buying as end-user
interest was fairly routine. Liquidation and profit-taking subsequently cut
into gains, but final business at Dollars 6,255 was still Dollars 62.50
above Friday's close. The immediate upside objective is Dollars 6,300, which
could be hit today if LME stocks fall as expected. Three-month ALUMINIUM
made another attempt in late trading to trigger stops lurking above Dollars
1,340, but finally closed at Dollars 1,338.50. The market was earlier
underpinned by Japanese buying, which unlocked some dealer covering with
consumers mostly willing to take a back seat. The London SUGAR markets
mainly dropped back sharply with New York, although trading went into a
temporary lull when New York trading was suspended because of technical
problems. New York dived on technical selling. 'I think people were
expecting the market to rally if they wanted to use the Thai situation as an
excuse,' one dealer said. 'But then the market went in the opposite
direction and everyone started bailing out.'
