FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Evans Halshaw beats forecast with Pounds
7.81m


   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent


Evans Halshaw, the Birmingham-based motor distribution and vehicle
management group, yesterday delivered its promise of a fourfold increase in
1993 profits and prompted a 17p rise in the share price to 549p.
It announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.81m for the 12 months to December,
compared with Pounds 1.71m for 1992.
Last November, when the group bought TK Motor Group, it forecast 1993
profits of Pounds 7.5m.
Earnings per share climbed from 5.4p to 24.3p, providing cover of 1.86 times
for the increased dividend.
The proposed final is 9.2p (7.65p), making a total of 13p, against 11.25p
for 1992 when payments to shareholders were partially financed from
reserves.
Turnover rose from Pounds 341.5m to Pounds 404.7m as the new and used car
market revived. New car sales were 28 per cent ahead and used car sales 16
per cent ahead of 1992.
However, the staple source of Evans Halshaw's profits - the servicing, parts
sales and accident repair market - was flat until towards the end of the
year.
This after-market provided 62 per cent of group profits, compared with 70
per cent in 1992. There was no absolute decline of earnings from the
after-market, but its share of group profits fell because earnings from car
sales rose.
Capital investment, notably in a second motor village at Solihull, West
Midlands, where five dealerships are grouped together, totalled Pounds 5.1m
last year. Mr Geoffrey Dale, chairman and chief executive, expects spending
this year to be slightly less.
'Across the group, car sales have been buoyant in the first two months of
1994 and our trading results are significantly ahead of the same period last
year,' Mr Dale said.
COMMENT
Evans Halshaw is riding up the economic cycle and its profits would no doubt
increase even if it did nothing except avoid silliness. In fact, it is
expanding into a fragmented market with costs already pared. It is now
obtaining the benefits of its investment of the last two years. Solihull
alone this year should sell 5,000 cars. It is developing other streams of
revenue like the sale of fleet management software. It is unrealistic to
expect another fourfold profits increase, but feasible to think of pre-tax
profits this year pushing towards Pounds 13m to give earnings per share of
about 40p. On a prospective multiple of less than 14, it looks as if they
have some way yet to motor, always providing that economic recovery is
sustained.
