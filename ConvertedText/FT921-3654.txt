FT  13 MAR 92 / Legal and General falls to Pounds 11.3m


   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent


LEGAL and General, the life assurance and financial services group,
yesterday reported a sharp drop in pre-tax profits in 1991 to Pounds 11.3m,
and said it would have recorded a significant loss without an unusual
accounting transaction that added Pounds 81.5m in exceptional profits.
In 1990, Legal and General had profits of Pounds 68.6m. The transfer of the
group's Unit Assurance and Unit Pensions Companies to the Society's Life
Fund allowed the company to post an exceptional profit by recording the
previously unrealised value of the subsidiaries.
Legal and General has also reduced the exposure of its shareholder funds -
upon which solvency margins are based - to UK equities. A Pounds 130m
holding has been cut to Pounds 100m over the past two months and the company
has purchased a put option on 25 per cent of the remaining exposure. Mr
David Rough, head of investments, said that the put expired in June and was
intended to shield the funds against possible volatility in the stock
markets following the UK election in April.
Meanwhile, Legal and General raised its final dividend of 12.6p for a total
1991 payout of 18.8p - a 5 per cent rise on 1990. Mr David Prosser, group
chief executive, said the dividend rise reflected the company's confidence
in the future of its core life and pensions business.
Profits in that sector rose modestly last year to Pounds 126m from Pounds
122m but general insurance recorded losses of Pounds 176m, compared with a
loss of Pounds 52m the year before.
Mr Prosser said general insurance would continue to lose money this year.
'We expect to see reduced losses in 1992 but still losses, I'm afraid,' he
said. He added that the company was reviewing its future in general
insurance. 'We don't want to be in general insurance if it is not going to
be profitable.'
In general insurance, reserves for losses on mortgage indemnity were raised
by Pounds 97m, with funds set aside for 90 per cent of properties in
repossession and 50 per cent of those with serious arrears.
Analysts said the reserve provisions were more prudent than those of most of
the company's competitors.
Legal and General also said it had been hit by Pounds 50m in subsidence
claims in 1991.
Earnings per share were 6.81p, compared with 12.07p.
