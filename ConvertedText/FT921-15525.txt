FT  09 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Sterling


Yet again, sterling is living dangerously. Yesterday's rate of DM2.8395 at
4pm London time - when the ERM ceases operation for the day - was the
closest it has been to its effective floor since it joined the system. The
optimist might argue that this does not matter. Since the floor is
determined by the peseta, intervention would presumably be directed at
pushing the peseta lower. Failing that, Spain could reverse the small rise
in overnight rates with which it responded to the latest Bundesbank
increase, thereby moving sterling's floor down by another couple of
pfennigs. If the system can be relied upon in this way, perhaps there is
nothing to worry about. The obvious snag is that in refusing to join its
partners in raising rates, the UK is trying to buck the system in the first
place.
