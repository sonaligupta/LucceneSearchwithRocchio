FT  26 MAY 93 / International Company News: DuPont to buy Monsanto unit


   By AP-DJ


DUPONT, the US chemicals group, is to acquire Monsanto's worldwide colloidal
silica business, AP-DJ reports.
DuPont said it would acquire the US group's production facilities at Ruabon,
North Wales, the Monsanto Syton trademark and all related assets of the
business.
DuPont sells colloidal silica under the Ludox trademark. It said the
acquisition would provide manufacturing and technical service bases for
DuPont's operations in Europe, Middle East, and Africa.
Colloidal silica is primarily used as a binder in investment casting and
ceramic fibre shapes.
