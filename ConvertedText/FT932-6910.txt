FT  26 MAY 93 / International Company News: Kmart benefits from renovations


   By NIKKI TAIT


   NEW YORK


KMART, the Michigan-based retailer which has been struggling to improve
performance in the highly-competitive discount store market, yesterday
claimed that its Dollars 3bn store renovation programme was producing
results. It also acknowledged that it was considering selling minority
interests in some of its specialty store subsidiaries.
Mr Joseph Antonini, chairman, told shareholders at the group's annual
meeting that annualised same-store sales growth from outlets which had been
overhauled was running at about 6 per cent. He also said that the group of
stores which the US retailer acquired in the Czech Republic and Slovakia was
being refurbished, and that 're-openings' were planned for next autumn.
The sales growth from the overhauled domestic stores is substantially better
than for the group overall. In the first quarter of 1993, when Kmart
reported an 80.7 per cent fall in after-tax profits, comparable store sales
in the general merchandise division rose 1.4 per cent.
Meanwhile, there was further evidence of problems in the US discount store
sector yesterday when Waban, the Massachusetts-based retailer, announced
that Mr John Levy had resigned as president and chief executive. Waban is
the smallest of the five major operators of 'warehouse clubs', the
ultra-cheap retail barns which have expanded hugely in recent years, but
whose future growth potential is now being questioned.
Wal-Mart itself was also active yesterday, launching a Dollars 1bn issue of
debt securities, according to reports in New York.
