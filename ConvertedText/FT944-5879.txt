FT  01 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Drugs setback for British Biotech


   By DANIEL GREEN


British Biotech, one of the best performing stocks in its sector on either
side of the Atlantic this year, has dropped two of its research programmes.
Disappointing results of early clinical trials prompted the company to
abandon one form of Aids vaccine, p24-VLP, and the use of another drug,
lexipafant, for septic shock.
The company also announced a second quarter pre-tax loss of Pounds 6.63m,
against a deficit of Pounds 4.61m in the comparable period last year. This
brings the loss for the half year to October 31 to Pounds 12.3m, against
Pounds 8.81m.
Turnover for the quarter increased from Pounds 693,000 to Pounds 858,000 -
mostly as a result of grant funding - making a deficit of Pounds 1.63m
(Pounds 2.83m) to date. Losses per share for the quarter emerged at 13.7p
(11.9p), amounting to 25.6p (22.8p) for the six months.
The company, which raised Pounds 46m in a rights issue in March, had cash
and short-term investments of Pounds 58.2m at the end of the quarter. At the
time of the rights issue it also sold warrants exercisable from December
1995 that could raise another Pounds 48m.
Other clinical trials are progressing steadily and important results are
expected during 1995, described as 'a pivotal year' for the company by
chairman Mr Brian Richards.
Statistically significant trials on the injectable version of batimastat
should yield results by the summer. Early trials on the same drug used for a
different condition, called pleural effusion, should begin in Europe and the
US. Results from early lexipafant trials in heart bypass surgery and asthma
should be available during 1995. Late stage trials in pancrea-titis will not
be complete until 1996.
Early stage trials in BB-2516, a pill version of batimastat, should start
'around the middle of 1995' in several tumour types and in both the US and
Europe.
There will be further initial clinical studies on BB-10010, designed to
protect bone marrow against damage during cancer chemotherapy.
The shares fell 2p to 573p yesterday.
COMMENT
Abandoning drugs in early development is a sign of strength, not weakness.
Too many of British Biotech's peers have carried on with a doubtful drug to
secure further funding or because they had nothing else. But little else is
rational about British Biotech's share price strength. The stock has risen
from 400p to almost 600p since midsummer, even though the company's top
drugs, batimastat and lexipafant, have yet to succeed in statistically
significant trials - the ones that count for regulators. On the other hand,
few analysts discourage a feel-good sensation among investors. If either
drug is a success, the shares could be worth many times their present value.
Rational investors will have to wait for a year to see if the company is
prepared to release the result of trials before the warrant exercise date.
Until then, emotion may well drive the share price up further.
