FT  02 JUL 92 / NI parties agree talks with Dublin


   By RALPH ATKINS


NORTHERN IRELAND'S politics moved into uncharted territory last night when
unionist and nationalist leaders agreed to negotiations with the government
of the Irish Republic.
British and Irish ministers are also to start talks on relations between the
two countries, including possible replacements for the 1985 Anglo-Irish
agreement.
The breakthrough, brokered by Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland
secretary, adds a rare momentum to all-party talks on the province's future
which have taken place, off and on, for more than a year.
It follows a 'talks about talks' meeting in London on Tuesday, where Irish
ministers met hardline unionists for the first time since partition in the
1920s. Even moderate unionists had not negotiated with the Irish government
since the 1973 Sunningdale conference.
With participants maintaining confidentiality, it is unclear to what extent
unionists and nationalists have agreed on proposals for devolution in the
province - the subject of the first 'strand' of the present talks which have
been taking place in Belfast for nine weeks. The Irish government was
excluded from strand one.
There may be an embryonic deal on a devolved assembly for the province with
a 'panel' that would form a quasi-cabinet. But details of the assembly's
powers and the composition of the panel would be highly symbolic for
unionists and nationalists.
Lack of progress in 'strand one' prevented, until yesterday, Sir Patrick
from announcing the second and third strands - on relations between north
and south Ireland and between London and Dublin respectively.
As late as the weekend, the Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic
Unionist party, was insisting that later stages could not start until
agreement was reached on a devolved government.
However, Sir Patrick appears to have persuaded unionists not to block a
start of 'strand two'.
