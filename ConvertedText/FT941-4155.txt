FT  12 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Wild beast's real problems


   From Dr PARVIZ DABIR-ALAI


Sir, The gist of Angus Foster's piece ('Taming the wild beast' - March 4) is
that Brazil has had unacceptably high inflation, the Urv may force it down
but not keep it there, and the finance minister might act as kingmaker to
himself or someone else. Brazil's real problems were not mentioned, giving
the impression that the pursuit of macro-economic stability was all that is
required.
While not an insignificant ingredient of an environment which may be
conducive to growth and prosperity, macro-economic stability alone is
insufficient. Tackling a record of poor governance and facing head on the
endemic poverty of many of its citizens are among a long list of
complementary factors required. Without these, resources devoted to
achieving macro-economic stability will just be wasted.
