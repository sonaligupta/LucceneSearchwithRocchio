FT  06 JAN 94 / Italians choke on drugs regime


   By HAIG SIMONIAN and DANIEL GREEN


   MILAN, LONDON


Seldom have drugs companies, doctors, pharmacists and patients been so
united against legislation as they are in Italy since new rules on selling
drugs came into effect on January 1.
Queues have built up outside pharmacies, doctors' surgeries and hospital
emergency units from Parma to Palermo as patients struggle to grasp the
impact of complex new laws designed to cut rising health costs and crack
down on unauthorised drug sales.
Foreign pharmaceutical companies have adopted a cautious response to rule
changes which put their products into three categories: A for free drugs; B
for those receiving a 50 per cent government subsidy; and C for drugs where
the patient pays the full cost.
They say they have yet to study the regulations and point out that there is
a 30-day period in which they can appeal against decisions to take drugs off
the free list.
There is much at stake for the industry. The Italian market is the third
biggest in the Europe and sales there last year were worth about 6 per cent
of the Dollars 200bn (Pounds 135.1bn) annual global prescription drug
market.
Sanofi-Winthrop, a US-French joint venture, is typical of many. Its sales of
Dollars 190m a year in Italy could be cut sharply. Several of its drugs,
including the big selling anti-clotting agent, Tiklit, have been consigned
to category B.
Even worse hit could be Ares-Serono, a Swiss company whose Italian sales
have already fallen by a quarter in Swiss franc terms in the past 12 months
thanks to drug price controls and devaluation of the lira.
The company said yesterday it expected sales to continue to fall. Its cancer
treatment, TPI, with sales worth Dollars 80m a year, has been put into
category C.
Opponents of the classifications should be cheered by the apparent anomalies
that have arisen. Glaxo of the UK, for example, makes two asthma drugs. The
old one, Ventolin is in category A, and the new one, Serevent, is in C. The
result is likely to be that Italian asthma sufferers will use the older
treatment.
Leading Italian drug companies, some of which say they will lose billions of
lire in annual sales as a result of the reclassification, have threatened to
take legal action against the health ministry on the grounds of inadequate
consultation.
However, Mr Cesare Fassari, a spokesman for the Italian pharmaceutical
industry association, has emphasised that his members back the government's
decision to update the previous list of free medicines and liberalise drugs
pricing.
Strict price supervision and the lengthy bureaucratic steps required to get
products on to the old list were partly responsible for the system of
kickbacks and other abuses by drugs companies which have come to light in
recent months in Italy's long-running political corruption scandal.
The industry, however, argues that the new classifications are likely to
need considerable revision within the next 60 days, when a new price
structure designed to bring Italian drugs prices into line those elsewhere
in Europe, comes into effect.
Senior government officials recognised yesterday that the new rules would
have to be altered to make them more transparent and potentially to soften
the blow for pharmaceutical companies.
