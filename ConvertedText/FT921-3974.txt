FT  11 MAR 92 / Observer: Synd-icated


Beset by criticism from all quarters, Lloyd's of London can ill-afford to
score own goals. Yet this appears to be what has happened with the
precipitate release of figures showing the the proportion of working and
outside Names on all syndicates in the insurance market.
The figures were released by the chairman, David Coleridge, last week with
the intention of casting light on to allegations that market insiders have
benefited to the detriment of outside Names.
Now, though, it appears they are incomplete.
Produced by the solvency and reporting department at Lloyd's Corporation,
the statistics effectively ignore 771 Names who resigned during 1986 and
1987 and more than 1,280 Names who have died over the six-year period
covered.
Lloyd's is moving quickly to rectify the error - its membership department
yesterday prepared a set of more accurate statistics - but is anxious to
stress that the mistake was 'a cock-up rather than a cover-up'.
