FT  29 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Thos Cook expands in Germany


THOMAS COOK, the world's largest travel agency, has expanded in Germany with
the purchase of Auto-Fischer, a leisure travel company operating in the
north-west of the country.
Thomas Cook, which is controlled by Westdeutsche Landesbank, would not
reveal the purchase price.
It said that the move was part of a strategy to expand in continental Europe
generally, particularly in Germany, regarded as a core market, and also in
Switzerland, Sweden and France.
The company said it regarded these as 'key markets' for expansion.
The acquisition will add 28 offices to Thomas Cook's overall operation which
encompasses 2,000 worldwide franchised and representative offices in 120
countries employing 12,000 people, of which 7,000 are in the UK.
