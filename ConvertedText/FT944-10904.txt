FT  08 NOV 94 / (CORRECTED) UK Company News: Automagic rises


Correction (published 9th November 1994) appended to this article.
Despite 'difficult trading conditions', pre-tax profits of Automagic
Holdings, the USM-quoted shoe repairing and key cutting group, almost
doubled from Pounds 122,000 to Pounds 243,000 in the year to June 25.
The outcome was struck on turnover down from Pounds 1.16m to Pounds 1.12m.
Earnings came out at 2.4p (2p).
Trading during the hot summer months had not been easy, directors said, and
the difficulties had been exacerbated by the signal workers' strikes.
CORRECTION
Turnover at Automagic in the year to June 25 fell from Pounds 11.6m to
Pounds 11.2m. The figures were wrongly reported in yesterday's FT.
