FT  23 JUL 93 / Insurers spared OFT action


THE OFFICE of Fair Trading has decided not to act against insurance
companies over their practice of recommending repairers and glass fitters to
motorists covered by their policies. The OFT has called, however, for
consumers to be made more aware of their rights.
Insurance companies recommend repair companies which may begin work on
damaged cars without further authorisation. Body shops and glass fitters
which are not participants have complained that consumers might assume that
they were required to employ a recommended repairer or fitter. They have
also complained that criteria for recommendation were unduly restrictive.
The OFT concluded that insurers were encouraging claimants to employ
recommended companies. In the case of glass replacement, insurers limit
their liability or impose an excess charge if the work is carried out by a
non-recommended fitter. For body repairs, advice given by insurers might
sometimes exaggerate the inconvenience and delay of employing a
non-recommended company.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, said much of the
perceived unfairness of these schemes could 'be traced to imperfect
understanding of their rights by consumers'. The OFT is to discuss with the
insurance industry ways of improving awareness of rights.
