FT  06 JUN 92 / Finance and the Family: Money down the drain


   By JOHN AUTHERS


A NEW survey by the Financial Adviser newspaper suggests that investors are
still throwing money down the drain by surrendering their endowment policies
early.
It found that more than 25 per cent of the 25-year with-profits policies -
the kind most often used to back up a mortgage - taken out in 1989, had
already lapsed.
For 10-year plans, where investors had made a less onerous commitment, the
lapse rate was just over 17 per cent.
As a general rule, it is only possible to get good value from an endowment
policy if you hold it to maturity, while surrender should be treated as a
last resort.
Early surrenders are expensive for all concerned, as the costs of
administration are loaded at the beginning of the policy. So these figures
could have a revealed a serious problem.
However, it is difficult to draw many confident conclusions as only 12 life
companies provided figures. Two of these, both with high surrender rates,
remained anonymous.
The Securities and Investments Board produced a report at the end of last
year which suggested that in 1990, 37.1 per cent of unit-linked endowments
and 23 per cent of with profits policies were terminated within two years of
being started.
Several prominent figures in the life industry queried the findings,
although few came forward with their own figures. The 12 offices who
answered Financial Adviser should at least be congratulated for their
candour.
In the figures for 1989 policies, NPI, which distributes through independent
advisers only, shows up best, with 99 per cent of both 10- and 25-year
policies surviving after three years. Next come Scottish Widows (94 per cent
over both terms), and Tunbridge Wells Equitable (93 per cent of 10-years and
88 per cent of 25-years).
The UK's two leading mutual societies, Standard Life and Norwich Union, both
saw a disquieting number of surrenders. Only 85 per cent of the 10- and
25-year policies Standard Life wrote in 1989 are still on the books, while
NU has retained 81 per cent of 10-year, and 82 per cent of 25-year
contracts.
Particularly low 25-year figures came from Sun Alliance, where 35 per cent
of policies have already lapsed, Prosperity Life (37 per cent) and Britannia
Life (32 per cent).
Only four offices - one of them anonymous - told Financial Adviser how many
of their 25-year policies written to mature this year actually did so.
Friends Provident's rate was 69 per cent, and Scottish Widows' 60 per cent,
while Norwich Union's survival rate was only 37 per cent. One anonymous
office had a survival rate of 38 per cent.
In this light, league tables of maturity values begin to lose some of their
point. The value you can receive after 25 years is considerable. But too
many investors never receive it.
