FT  14 APR 94 / Temps boost labour market


Temporary employment has held up much better through the recession than
permanent jobs, according to an employment index published published
yesterday by Reed personnel services.
The index shows that demand for permanent jobs fell to a low of 28 in the
fourth quarter of 1992 from a base of 100 in the first quarter of 1990. The
index now stands at 43.
The lowest demand for temporary staff, recorded in the first quarter of
1992, was 65. The figure for temporary staff is now higher than the 1990
base point.
Reed said this confirms temporary staff as a significant part of the labour
force.
