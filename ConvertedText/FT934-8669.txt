FT  13 NOV 93 / Haiti petrol warning


   By REUTER


   PORT AU PRINCE


A lawyer for Haiti's petrol distributors said yesterday his clients would
use force if necessary to secure the release of fuel reserves frozen under a
UN embargo, Reuters reports from Port au Prince.
Shell Co (WI) Ltd and Exxon Corp said they would not comply with orders from
a military-backed court to distribute gasoline reserves because that would
violate a UN oil embargo imposed on Haiti three weeks ago.
