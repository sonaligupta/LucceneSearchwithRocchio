FT  13 APR 94 / International Company News: Quebecor to purchase US book
producer for Dollars 200m

   MONTREAL


Quebecor, North American-based international publishing, printing and forest
products group, is buying Arcata, the second biggest book producer in the
US, for USDollars 200m.
The move fits Quebecor's recent acquisition of two US companies specialising
in CD-Rom technology.
Quebecor Printing, majority controlled by Quebecor and the Peladeau family,
a year ago bought Arcata's commercial printing plants for almost Dollars
100m and took an option on its six book-production plants with expiry in
1996.
Mr Charles Cavell, president of Quebecor Printing, said the company had
exercised this option early as Arcata's book business was doing 'extremely
well' and would offset the commercial printing cycle.
Quebecor Printing gets six plants in Tennessee, Pennsylvania and West
Virginia which employ 3,500 and had 1993 sales of Dollars 317m.
They will bring Quebecor Printing's annual revenue to more than Dollars 2bn.
The company is the largest US commercial printer after R. R. Donnelly. It
also operates in Mexico and France and recently entered a joint venture in
India.
