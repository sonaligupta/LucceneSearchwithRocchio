Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, yesterday announced that it had
made a promising gas and condensate discovery in the Norwegian North Sea
worth an estimated NKr40bn (Dollars 5.5bn).
Recoverable reserves of the discovery in block 34/11 are estimated at 60bn
cu m of gas and 125m barrels of associated condensate - a form of light oil.
Statoil said the exploration well has proved the existence of one third of
the estimated total quantities in the reserves and compared the size of the
discovery to that of the Gullfaks South field.
The company, which is in charge of the operations and has a 65 per cent
share in the licence, is considering drilling an appraisal well next year to
better define the discovery.
Norsk Hydro Produksjon, a unit of Norsk Hydro, Norway's largest listed
company, holds 20 per cent of the licence and BP Norge 15 per cent.
