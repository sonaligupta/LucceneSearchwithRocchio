FT  28 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Baker's curse - Ballot Box


Sebastian Coe, the Olympic gold medallist and Conservative candidate for the
Cornish constituency of Falmouth and Camborne, has fallen out with Kenneth
Baker, the home secretary.
Baker appeared in the constituency on Wednesday to dismiss Coe's locally
bred opponents as 'mediocre and obscure'. The venerable Falmouth Packet
newspaper (established 1827) reported on its front page that the home
secretary had treated the Cornish like dirt. Coe has been apologising ever
since.
