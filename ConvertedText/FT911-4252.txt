FT  20 APR 91 / UK Company News: Helical Bar drops 81% to Pounds 2.71m


HIGH INTEREST rates, weakening tenant demand and falling capital values hit
Helical Bar, the property investor, in the year ended January 31 1991.
They wiped out a 33 per cent increase to Pounds 18.87m in rental income, and
caused an 81 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 2.71m (Pounds
14.5m).
The dividend is, however, being maintained at 10p with a final of 7.6p, from
fully diluted earnings per share of 14.8p (45.8p). The earnings included
extraordinary profits of Pounds 847,000 (Pounds 2.38m) arising from the sale
of investment properties.
Net asset value also suffered, falling from 429p to 303p over the year. That
reflected a reduction in reserves of Pounds 14.26m (increase Pounds 21.7m)
following a professional valuation of the investment properties, and a
surplus on directors' valuation of trading properties of Pounds 9.17m
(Pounds 19.8m).
At the year end the group had over Pounds 18m in the bank and a passing rent
roll of Pounds 18.5m, which more than covered annual net interest costs -
which were Pounds 19.1m last year (Pounds 15.6m).
Turnover came to Pounds 74.76m (Pounds 117.47m) and gross profit to Pounds
25.26m (Pounds 33.5m).
