FT  20 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Good earnings reports offset
economic data


   By PATRICK HARVERSON


   NEW YORK


Wall Street
DESPITE some unexpectedly bad economic news, US stock markets held their
ground yesterday, thanks partly to some good earnings reports, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 2.16 at 3,209.53,
having spent all day a few points either side of opening values. The more
broadly based Standard & Poor's 500 also ended little changed, up just 0.75
at 423.60, while the Amex composite finished 2.85 higher at 389.34 and the
Nasdaq composite 3.73 firmer at 638.59. Turnover on the NYSE was heavy at
219m shares, and rises outnumbered declines by 951 to 794.
After a series of better-than-expected economic data, market sentiment was
hit by two disappointing reports yesterday morning. The labor department
announced a 31,000 rise in weekly jobless claims to a new total of 386,000,
an increase which was much higher than forecast. Similarly, analysts were
caught out by the commerce department's report of a 1.1 per cent drop in
October housing starts.
There was one piece of good news, however. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve
reported that its measure of local manufacturing activity is up sharply this
month, an indication that the economy in the region is coming back to life.
There was also some good corporate news for the market. Campbell Soup rose
Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 43 1/2 in turnover of more than 500,000 shares
after the food group announced a 21 per cent increase in profits to Dollars
156.6m and a 10 per cent increase in sales to Dollars 1.7bn during the third
quarter.
Owens-Corning rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 30 1/4 after Merrill Lynch, the
Wall Street broking house, raised its fourth-quarter profits forecast from
36 cents a share to 41 cents a share.
Morgan Stanley eased Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 53 after the big securities
company reported a small drop in third-quarter profits to Dollars 110.6m.
The results were in line with market expectations.
Transamerica jumped Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 45 1/8 after the financial
services conglomerate announced that it was floating a majority of its
property-casualty insurance operations. The company had previously announced
that it would dispose of the units.
Shares in Sony Corp dropped Dollars 1 to Dollars 30 7/8 after the Japanese
electronics and entertainment giant reported that consolidated pre-tax
profit for the first half fell 61 per cent.
AT&T firmed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 47 1/8 on the news that the
telecommunications group plans to sell 15 per cent of its AT&T Capital
leasing subsidiary in a offer to the public.
On the Nasdaq market, National Computer dropped Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 15
after reporting third-quarter net income of 23 cents a share, down from 25
cents a share a year earlier and below analysts' forecasts.
Canada
TORONTO stock prices strayed little from Wednesday's levels in active
trading.
The TSE 300 composite index was up 2.05 points or 0.06 per cent to end at
3233.73. Declining issues topped advances 283 to 262.
