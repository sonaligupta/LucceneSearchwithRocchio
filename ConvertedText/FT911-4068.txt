FT  22 APR 91 / Palestinians likely to seek closer links with peace talks

PALESTINIAN leaders, who began meeting in Tunis yesterday to review
post-Gulf war developments, are expected to call for closer co-ordination
with Arab states engaged in peace talks with the US.
The Palestinians' Central Council or 'mini-parliament' is also likely to lay
down guidelines for Palestine Liberation Organisation participation in any
proposed peace process.
PLO officials have expressed strong reservations about the latest US Middle
East peace mission. They fear the US will seek to exclude the PLO from the
process.
But the organisation, sidelined regionally and internationally since its
support of Iraq in the Gulf war, is anxious to use any opportunity to
re-establish working relations with Egypt and the Gulf states.
Mr Abdullah Hourani, a member of the PLO's Executive Committee or 'cabinet',
said yesterday that 'co-ordination between Arab positions is important. . .
in particular, total agreement between the PLO and Jordan on all stages in
the peace process.'
The Central Council is likely to review the PLO's performance during the
recent crisis and to discuss ways to revive its flagging fortunes.
Among options to be discussed are convening a session of the Palestine
Nations Council, the Palestinian 'parliament', to express confidence in the
PLO leadership. There has also been talk of seeking UN backing for elections
in the occupied territories for delegates to the PNC.
