FT  20 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): US interest rate move
leaves region lower


   By REUTER


   TOKYO


Stocks weakened but closed off session lows on afternoon index-linked
buying, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
Trading remained quiet throughout the day following a steep fall on Wall
Street after the US Federal Reserve announced a further tightening of
monetary policy.
The Nikkei 225 lost 85.02 to 20,192.34, after a low of 20,119.42 and a high
of 20,300.66.
The Topix index ended down 6.23 at 1,637.01 and the Nikkei 300 shed 1.36 to
299.55. Volume was estimated at 320m shares, down from 387m on Monday.
Traders said that buying by foreign institutions and orders placed by
domestic institutions prevented shares from slipping more sharply.
The 20,500 level is currently regarded as a major barrier for the Nikkei and
investors are waiting for news which could encourage them to drive shares
above that level.
Declining issues outstripped advances with 687 lower, 336 higher and 152
unchanged.
In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.94 to 1,388.41.
Airline, mining, automobile, service and banking sectors led the gains.
Pioneer Electronic rose on bargain-hunting, gaining Y100 to Y2,600 in heavy
turnover. Shares were sought on a perception that they had been left behind
in the recent rally among multimedia-related issues.
Roundup
The rise in US short-term interest rates left the region almost uniformly
lower.
Ms Joanna Shi at Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia noted that the impact on
the Asian economies would be mixed. For Hong Kong and Thailand, the move was
bad news as both countries were effectively pegged to the US dollar and
interest rates would rise automatically in line with those in the US.
'The likely interest move in these two markets,' she said, 'will drain
excess liquidity from the stock market.'
Ms Shi added that for Malaysia, the impact would be minimal as interest
rates were on a different cycle. Singapore's strong economic growth would
lead to interest rates rising regardless of what happened in the US.
'In general, real economic growth is still exceptionally strong in the Asian
region and thus sound fundamentals will support these markets after their
initial fall.'
HONG KONG fell 2.1 per cent, although late bargain hunting by institutional
investors helped to pare losses.
The Hang Seng index sank 202.93 to 9,303.36, having dipped to a low of
9,203.09. Turnover rose to HKDollars 4.30bn.
BANGKOK declined nearly 3 per cent, attributed both to the news from the US
and to profit-taking following a gain of nearly 7 per cent over the last
week. The SET index fell 38.31 to 1,274.02 in turnover of Bt8.2bn against
Monday's Bt9.3bn.
AUSTRALIA was driven down by weaker bonds and futures and bearish overseas
markets. The All Ordinaries index lost more than 20 points in the first 10
minutes of trade before ending 34.5 down at 2,061.4.
SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial index fell 18.07 to 2,221.00, prompting
the view that the market was likely to consolidate in the short term,
although it will remain underpinned by a strong economy and healthy
corporate earnings growth.
SEOUL finished down in very thin trade after brief early gains were
overwhelmed by a round of profit-taking in blue chips. The composite index
lost 6.30 to 885.85 in volume of 24.6m shares, compared with the recent
average of 35m.
TAIWAN edged slightly lower in active trade on profit-taking after Monday's
rally. The weighted index fell 14.38 to 5,675.75 in turnover of TDollars
58.9bn. Profit-taking was seen in financials and steels, which gained most
recently.
NEW ZEALAND took its lead from falls in other markets and the NZSE 40
Capital index fell 37.41 to 2,104.70 in moderate turnover of NZDollars 45m.
BOMBAY ended lower ahead of a public holiday today and the end of the
account tomorrow. The BSE 30-share index fell 36.62 to 3,830.29.
MANILA finished higher in spite of a fall during the morning session. The
composite index added 5.82 to 2,825.93.
Gains were led by Manila Electric B shares which jumped 12.50 pesos to 510
pesos.
Volume eased to 838.2m shares compared to Monday's 1.3bn shares, while
turnover increased to 1bn pesos from 966.5m pesos.
KARACHI rose on the first day of the new account with most of the activity
concentrated on the major blue chip issues. The KSE 100-share index rose
28.01 or 1.1 per cent to 2,525.48 as volume rose to 12.2m shares from 9.8m.
