FT  29 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Tax staff vote to end industrial
action


   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent


TAX WORKERS have voted by a narrow majority to end industrial action after
concessions from the Inland Revenue on a disputed performance-pay system.
They voted by 22,865 to 21,283 to accept the interim package, which includes
the winding-up of the staff appraisal system. Their union, the Inland
Revenue Staff Federation, said the system was distorted because of its links
to performance-pay awards. It recommended acceptance of the interim deal,
which will include lump-sum payments of Pounds 300 for about 14,000 staff.
The industrial action, approved by a ballot in December, included an
overtime ban and a 'work to charter' which entailed concentrating on tasks
of benefit to the public rather than those which benefited the Revenue.
Mr Clive Brooke, federation general secretary, said the ballot result should
indicate clearly to the Treasury that industrial relations would remain
difficult in the Revenue unless a final package could be agreed.
