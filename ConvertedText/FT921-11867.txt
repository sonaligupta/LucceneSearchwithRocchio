FT  29 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading


   By JOEL KIBAZO


A BURST of activity in the last few minutes of trading in stock index
futures brought a measure of excitement to an otherwise directionless
session, writes Joel Kibazo.
The March contract opened strongly with traders reporting 2,580 as the
resistance point. A strong performance by short sterling and UK gilts,
coupled with an advance in US bonds and a firm Wall Street, encouraged
sporadic buying during the afternoon.
However, a big buy order from a leading securities house some 10 minutes
before the market's official close triggered a squeeze, sending March
forward to a large premium. Traders were also reported to have moved to
cover short positions ahead of the US president's State of the Union speech.
March closed at 2,594, a premium of 42, compared with its estimated fair
value premium to cash of 16.
In traded options, the FT-SE 100 Index's turnover of 8,468 contracts
accounted for a large part of the days's total of 28,724. Rolls-Royce, where
fears of a dividend cut had begun to fade, was the busiest stock option. It
had 5,547 contracts dealt, with UBS Phillips & Drew and SG Warburg reported
to have carried out a majority of the day's business.
