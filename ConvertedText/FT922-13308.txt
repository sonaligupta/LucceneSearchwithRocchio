FT  13 APR 92 / Economics: Focus on UK jobless total


   By PETER MARSH


ATTENTION in the UK will focus on whether recent faint signs of economic
recovery will be reflected in the latest unemployment figures, to be
published on Thursday.
In the US, analysts will study a raft of economic data for clues as to the
hesitant revival, while the markets wait anxiously to see how far the latest
figures for industrial production in Japan indicate the economy is slowing
down.
Economists think the UK will announce a March rise in joblessness of about
40,000, similar to February's figure. The government is also expected to
announce a high public sector borrowing requirement in March of about Pounds
6.2bn, bringing the PSBR for the 1991-92 financial year to nearly Pounds
14bn.
Unemployment below 40,000 might indicate stronger signs of an economic
recovery than have been apparent over the past few weeks. Some economists
believe the continuation of Conservative economic policies after last week's
election result will reduce consumer and industrial uncertainties and lead
to a surge in spending in the next few months, a development which could
lead to more favourable growth prospects.
Highlights of the week ahead, with projections in brackets provided by
financial information company MMS International, are as follows:
Today: Switzerland, monthly meeting of central bank govenors at Bank of
