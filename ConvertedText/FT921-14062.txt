FT  17 JAN 92 / Rise seen in water pollution incidents


THE NUMBER of water pollution incidents rose in seven of the 10 regions of
England and Wales between 1988 and 1990, according to a report from the
National Rivers Authority, leaked by Friends of the Earth, the environmental
pressure group, yesterday.
However, in the same period there was an overall drop of 3.5 per cent in
pollution incidents from 26,926 to 25,983.
The rivers watchdog said that Friends of the Earth had obtained an early
draft of the report on the regions run by the privatised water companies.
The final version, to be published later this month, would show entirely
different figures. The draft report says the overall decrease was accounted
for by a 55 per fall in cases reported in the Thames Water region.
Without the decline reported for the Thames region, the national trend would
be a 55 per cent increase in incidents. The other areas with a drop were
Yorkshire and Wessex.
