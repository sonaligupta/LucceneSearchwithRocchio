FT  05 AUG 92 / NHS emergency cover criticised


STAFFING AT hospital accident and emergency departments in England is often
overstretched, with some being manned by inexperienced doctors during busy
night periods, the National Audit Office said yesterday.
It said medical staffing levels often fell 'well short' of recommended
levels.
In a separate report on Scotland the audit office said that consultants for
accident and emergency departments were 'often overstretched'.
Last year the audit office examined the organisation of departments at six
hospitals: Leicester Royal Infirmary; University College Hospital, London;
Taunton and Somerset Hospital; St James's University Hospital, Leeds; Leeds
General Infirmary; and Worcester Royal Infirmary.
The report says that at night - in all cases but Leicester Royal Infirmary,
which employed the highest number of registrars and senior registrars -
inexperienced senior house officers who needed advice had to call in a
consultant from home or seek advice by telephone.
The audit office concludes that while all the departments were well run on a
day-to-day basis, 'our examination pointed to opportunities for more
positive management' including stronger accident and emergency department
representation in hospital management.
In the Scottish report the audit office calls for a review by the Scottish
Office and health boards of the kind of service which should be developed
over the next decade.
It looked at six accident and emergency departments at Aberdeen Royal
Infirmary; Monklands General Hospital, Strathclyde; St John's Hospital,
Howden; Edinburgh Royal Infirmary; West Highland Hospital, Oban; and Belford
Hospital, Fort William.
It found that the limited number of experienced staff at Fort William and at
Oban meant 'supervision of house officers was often nominal'.
