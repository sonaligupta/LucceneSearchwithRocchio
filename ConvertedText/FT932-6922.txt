FT  26 MAY 93 / International Company News: AT&T in Asia network link


   By MARTIN DICKSON


   NEW YORK


AMERICAN Telephone & Telegraph, the leading US long-distance
telecommunications group, yesterday linked with Kokusai Denshin Denwa of
Japan and Singapore Telecom to create a formidable new competitor in the
fast-growing market for global business communications services.
AT&T also wants to form alliances with European telecommunications groups,
but - in a move likely to put pressure on these companies - it said for now
it would go ahead with its own European system. It would be introduced in
1994 and involve spending Dollars 350m over five years.
Other leading telecommunications companies, such as British Telecom and MCI
Communications of the US, have been trying to build up their own global
networks, but AT&T's deal is the most far-reaching pact yet announced.
It said yesterday that customers of its 'Worldsource' service would get
one-stop shopping for ordering, provisioning and maintenance around the
globe. Billing would be consolidated in a customer's choice of country,
language and currency.
The service will be available later this year in North America and the
Asia-Pacific region.
AT&T is forming an association with KDD and Singapore Telecom, which expects
to spend over Dollars 100m to provide services to customers in the
Asia-Pacific region over the next few years.
AT&T said Telstra, Australia's long-distance company, Unitel Communications,
a new Canadian long-distance company, and Korea Telecom also planned to join
the association.
While AT&T has been in discussion with European telecoms companies, it has
yet to reach agreement with any on membership of the association.
It therefore intends to go ahead itself, and will add to its network
management centres in Britain and the Netherlands by setting up new service
systems in leading European business centres.
