FT  19 APR 91 / World Trade News: EC riled by states' trade barriers in US


   By DAVID BUCHAN


Exporters to the US face more and more trade and regulatory hurdles erected
at the state, rather than federal level, the European Commission complained
yesterday in its annual report on America's trade barriers, writes David
Buchan.
'We are searching for ways of influencing state legislation,' a Commission
official said, 'but our problem is that our diplomatic contacts are with
Washington, which tells us how little control it has over individual
states.'
The EC report stresses that shutting foreigners out of state contracts
matters because of the growing proportion of public spending by state
governments rather than the deficit-ridden federal government. It says
setting by states of fiscal, technical and environmental standards also
causes foreigners problems.
