FT  13 NOV 92 / Letter: Sign of moral bankruptcy


   From Mr BERNARD A WEBB


Sir, E N Addison's summary (Letters, November 12) - 'put your country first
and forget your high principles' - of your November 10 leader ('The Matrix
case') undoubtedly states the moral bankruptcy of a generation of
trade-at-any-price conservative politicians, of whom Alan Clark, former
trade minister, is only one unusually honest example.
Mr Addison is clearly a member of the club: '. . . things have come out
which would have been better left unsaid.' Would he make the same assertion
to the Matrix Churchill defendants?
