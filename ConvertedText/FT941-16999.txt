FT  06 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: TV stocks busy


   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO


Television stocks were once again among the day's best performers as James
Capel turned more positive on the sector as a whole.
The agency broker urged investors to 'go overweight' from its previous 'in
line' advice, its favourite stock being Carlton Communications. The shares
finished 12 ahead at 959p, after touching 964p, and 2.4m were traded.
The recommendation from James Capel gave a further boost to a sector buoyed
by bid speculation following news of a wide ranging review of UK cross-media
ownership. A further advance was seen in LWT, up 20 at 626p, after the
company said it was still in merger talks with Yorkshire-Tyne Tees TV, 18
ahead at 192p.
But it was a strong recommendation from UBS that sent Granada up 18 to a
record 539p on volume of 6.1m. Anglia, another potential takeover candidate,
put on 8 at 441p.
Among publishing stocks, James Capel also favours United Newspapers and the
shares gained 22 at 676p.
Legal & General advanced 6 to 511p after Strauss Turnbull turned buyer of
the stock. Analysts at the broking house said it had been oversold in recent
sessions. Strauss also advised investors to switch out of Guardian Royal
Exchange and into Commercial Union. The former shed 2 to 228p, while the
latter firmed 2 to 647p.
The onset of a ferry price war ahead of the opening of the Channel tunnel
later this year weakened P&O, one of the main ferry operators across the
channel. The shares retreated 19 to 619p.
Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel remained in demand following Tuesday's
funding agreement with the group's bankers. The shares gained a further 14
to 644p, with the stock once again reported to have been heavily traded in
Paris, where it is also listed.
Profit-takers moved into the stores sector, although some second liners were
in demand on the talk of good Christmas sales. Allders jumped 14 to 218p,
with encouraging trade reports from John Lewis and House of Fraser said to
have underpinned support. Luxury goods group Vendome gained 8 at 394p and
Sears edged up 1 1/2 to 126 1/2 p. Moss Bros climbed 17 to 260p. WH Smith
'A' ran out of steam and slipped 3 1/2 to 514p, but reports of strong book
sales again lifted Pentos, up 2 at 29p. Among jewellery groups, Signet added
1 1/2 at 27 3/4 p and Goldsmiths put on 3 at 91p. Among the majors, Boots
slid 6 to 587p, Great Universal Stores 8 to 637p, Kingfisher 10 to 762p and
Dixons 4 to 283p.
A hefty note from Kleinwort Benson on pub operators brought interest to an
otherwise muted drinks sector. The broker advised selling Boddington, off 5
at 280p, because of the shares' big premium to asset value and the likely
sale of the near 20 per cent stake held by Whitbread. It was also negative
on Vaux, down 3 at 269p, which it considers fully valued. Greene King, up 2
at 553p, survived the broker's bearish remarks. Bass rose 7 to 548p, with SG
Warburg said to be positive.
There was another day's busy trading in Ladbroke, although the large gains
made on Tuesday were reigned in and the shares ended just 2 higher at 177p.
Turnover reached 10m. Thorn EMI jumped 21 to a record 1011p in volume of
2.6m, dealers attributing the rise to con-tinued talk of takeover in the
multimedia market.
A clutch of brokers' recommendations following Tuesday's announcement by
Williams Holdings that it was buying a US commercial locks manufacturer
boosted the group's shares. They jumped 14 to 391p on 2.2m dealt. The list
of brokers recommending the shares included Robert Fleming and NatWest
Securities.
International mining group RTZ surrendered most of Tuesday's rise as brokers
advised investors to 'take profits'. The shares receded 10 to 834p.
A firm gold price coupled with favourable comment lifted international
trading group Lonrho 6 to 140p. Also benefiting from the higher gold price
was Monarch Resources, 9 up at 236p.
Among aerospace and engineering stocks, Westland Group advanced 9 to 265p on
news that it had won a Pounds 150m helicopter order from Brazil. Henderson
Crosthwaite was reported to have acted for the day's big buyer of
Rolls-Royce. The shares put on 5 to 168p in active trading of 8.5m.
In motors, investors turned their attention to GKN, one of last year's
underperforming stocks, with some talk of the possibility of an improvement
in the group's European markets this year. The shares forged ahead 22 to
547p, while Laird Group advanced 11 to 356p in sympathy.
