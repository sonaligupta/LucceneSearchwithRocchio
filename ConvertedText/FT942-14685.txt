FT  19 APR 94 / International Company News: Hungarian retailer's equity
offer nets Dollars 70m


   By NICHOLAS DENTON


   BUDAPEST


Fotex, the private Hungarian retail group, has raised Dollars 70m new
capital through the largest international equity offering by an east
European company.
CS First Boston, global co-ordinator, said the offer had been fully
subscribed. Fotex raised Dollars 54m through an international placement in
1991.
The current offer was taken up by institutional investors in Europe and the
US, including CSFB's own recently-launched Dollars 200m Central European
Fund.
Mr Gabor Varszegi, Fotex's chief executive, principal shareholder and
eastern Europe's richest individual, subscribed to the new issue and
maintained his holdings at 24 per cent.
Fotex and CSFB had planned to raise between Dollars 80m and Dollars 100m,
but adverse market conditions curtailed their ambitions. Prospects of a rise
in US interest rates, and sharp falls on the Turkish and Warsaw stock
markets, contributed to a general nervousness among investors.
The size of the issue was also limited by Mr Varszegi's reluctance to issue
shares at a discount. The deal was priced only marginally below the
prevailing market rate, at Ft507 (Dollars 4.88), giving a ratio to
prospective 1994 earnings of about 15-16.
Fotex is listed on the Budapest exchange and traded over the counter in
London, Munich and Frankfurt. The group's ADRs trade in New York and Fotex
plans to apply for a Nasdaq quotation.
Fotex said it would use part of the proceeds to complete the Dollars 30m
purchase of Keravill, Hungary's largest chain selling consumer electronics
and household appliances.
Audited net profit rose 38.2 per cent to Ft945m (Dollars 10.3m) in 1993 and
turnover grew 83.4 per cent to Ft15.8bn. Mr Varszegi forecast a doubling of
both sales and profits in 1994, due in roughly equal measure to acquisition
and organic growth.
