FT  12 MAR 94 / FT Round the World Ski Expedition


Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are trying to ski every day of 1994 on a
round-the-world expedition. Arnie writes:
Early March was grim - heavy rain, ice and thick fog. In North Carolina we
slithered to a halt on a steep road to Hawksnest, unable to continue (it
turned out to be closed anyway). And we missed Sugar Mountain completely in
the fog, ending up at Beech Mountain where visibility was so appalling that
for self-preservation we skied only three runs.
When the fog lifted we found Sugar Mountain, the biggest skiing area in the
valley, and made a determined effort to make up for lost time by
night-skiing.
Reaching Snowshoe, West Virginia, brought a sigh of relief - a real ski
resort with a 1,200ft vertical drop and one particularly exhilarating run
called Cupp Trail, 1 1/2 miles long. We have enjoyed North America
enormously, but now can't wait to arrive in Europe on Monday.
Readers could win a skiing holiday in Courmayeur, or ski equipment, by
entering the competition which appeared in Weekend FT on March 5 (copies
