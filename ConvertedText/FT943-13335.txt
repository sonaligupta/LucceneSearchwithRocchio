We are promised details of a secret 50 years old on Countryfile: the
organisation and training of the BRO, the British Resistence Organisation.
Described as highly trained and heavily armed, this underground home guard
was apparently recruited from farmers, gamekeepers and fishermen. Organised
in cells of six or eight, the idea was that they would use their underground
bunkers, stocked with food and weapons, as bases from which to harry the
invader (7.30 BBC1). An oddly parallel story is told in The Restless
Conscience which is concerned with resistence to the Nazis inside Germany.
Nominated for an Oscar, this two-hour documentary is concerned with
individual acts of heroism rather than any underground organisation (10.55
C4). Frontline looks again at the death of WPc Yvonne Fletcher who was
killed in St James's Square in the centre of London 10 years ago by a shot
which came from the Libyan People's Bureau (9.00 C4). The final of The BBC
Design Awards, in which 100,000 members of the public may have voted, is
screened by BBC2 (9.50).
