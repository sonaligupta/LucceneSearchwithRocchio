FT  23 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Bullough sharply lower after further
restructuring costs


   By PAUL TAYLOR


BULLOUGH, the office products and refrigeration group, reported sharply
lower interim pre-tax profits after taking a Pounds 4.67m charge to cover
further restructuring in its French office furniture, Belgian industrial
heating and UK raised flooring businesses.
The restructuring costs, coupled with higher net interest payments of Pounds
921,000 (Pounds 418,000), reduced the group almost to break-even in the six
months to April 30 with pre-tax profits of just Pounds 50,000, compared to
Pounds 5.89m last time.
Turnover edged up to Pounds 133.4m (Pounds 132.7m), but would have been
slightly lower had it not been for currency influences.
Earnings per share fell to 0.02p (3.12p) but the interim dividend is
maintained at 1.75p and the group said that 'in the absence of unforeseen
circumstances' it intends to maintain the final of 4.3p.
Operating profits, before the restructuring costs, fell to Pounds 5.64m
(Pounds 6.31m) but Mr Robert Steel, managing director, said the year-on-year
figures masked a significant improvement in the office products business
over the 1992 second half when the group took a restructuring charge of
Pounds 3.32m.
Turnover in the core office products division slipped to Pounds 50m (Pounds
54.8m) but the division recorded a Pounds 83,000 operating profit compared
to a Pounds 2.3m loss in the 1992 second half, helped by improved profits
from the Project office furniture business in the UK.
Mr Steel said the latest restructuring charge, mostly to cover redundancy
costs, had been made necessary by the unexpected severity of recession in
the French office furniture equipment market and in Reznor's industrial
heater business based in Belgium.
More than half of the restructuring costs were attributable to Atal with the
balance split between Reznor and the Propaflor business in the UK.
Overall, the workforce was reduced by 400 to 4,600 during the first half,
and is expected to contract further although Mr Derrick Battle, chairman,
emphasised that the group does not expect any further restructuring charges.
