FT  20 MAY 92 / International Company News: Sharp rise in income at Dell
Computer

DELL Computer more than doubled first-quarter revenues as US personal
computer sales boomed. The Texas company, a pioneer in the mail order
distribution of computers, also nearly doubled its earnings, reporting
results well above expectations.
Net income was Dollars 19.8m or 52 cents a share, up from Dollars 10.1m or
30 cents in the same period a year ago. Revenues for the quarter were
Dollars 366.1m, compared with Dollars 174.8m a year earlier.
'Our market-share momentum accelerated during the quarter and confirms our
belief that Dell's business model may be imitated - but not duplicated,'
said Mr Michael S. Dell, chairman and chief executive officer.
In recent months, several of Dell's competitors, including International
Business Machines, Digital Equipment and Compaq Computer have begun offering
mail order services.
Dell's strong earnings are particularly remarkable at a time when many
personal computer manufacturers are struggling to adjust to rapidly
declining prices and changing distribution channels, with discount
'superstores' now representing a primary sales channel in the US.
In the first quarter of fiscal 1993, sales doubled in both US and
international operations and were higher in every country and in every
customer segment over the comparable quarter a year ago, the company said.
'Our domestic sales were up more than 35 per cent from the fourth quarter of
last fiscal year and order rates accelerated as the quarter progressed,'
said Mr Dell.
International sales were Dollars 139.8m, compared with Dollars 70.1m
previously.
