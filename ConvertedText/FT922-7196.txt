FT  20 MAY 92 / Post plan for teams opposed


   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff


POST Office plans to improve customer service through a 'total quality'
programme encountered opposition yesterday from the UCW, the main postal
union.
The union voted at its annual conference in Bournemouth to oppose increased
job specialisation and team working, and to ballot on strike action over the
latter if necessary.
Royal Mail, the letters arm of the Post Office, has been trying for more
than two years to introduce into sorting and delivery operations a system of
self-regulating teams, headed by team leaders. This is part of a drive to
introduce 'total quality' principles, focusing on excellence of service and
customers' needs.
The UCW fears that managers will bypass shopfloor union representatives and
talk to team leaders.
Royal Mail said yesterday that it had 'no plans to introduce team working
overnight'. It would continue, by consultation and persuasion, to 'dispel
any misunderstanding' among the workforce. There was no intention to
undermine union representatives, it added.
The vote opposing teamworking was taken against the advice of the union's
leadership, so it is possible that talks between the UCW and Royal Mail may
continue.
Royal Mail, as part of its efforts to improve services, also wants each
household to have its own regular postman or postwoman. That would mean
workers having to become more specialised.
The UCW voted to oppose such specialisation, arguing that members prefer to
rotate hours and duties, and maintain work variety.
