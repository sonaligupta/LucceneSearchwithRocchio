FT  08 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Wellcome's US boost from Zovirax

US REVENUES generated by Zovirax, the world's best-selling anti-viral drug
marketed by Wellcome, the UK pharmaceutical group, could be far higher than
analysts' predictions, according to a leading American virologist.
Dr Richard Whitely, Professor of Paediatrics and Clinical Virology at the
University of Alabama, believes Zovirax will be used by as many as 1m
chicken pox patients over the next 12 months and by as many as 3m a year as
early as 1996.
Previous estimates of Zovirax sales for this illness have been far lower. In
a recent note, SG Warburg, the company's brokers, estimated only 20 per cent
of US patients would use the drug by 1994, generating additional revenues of
only Pounds 15m.
Zovirax, which is used mainly to treat herpes and related infections, was
only licensed in the US for chicken pox early this year.
Between 3.4m and 4m US residents catch the disease annually.
Speaking at a virology conference in Berlin, Dr Whitely said he believed
general practitioners would come under intense pressure form Paris to
prescribe Zovirax for children infected with chicken pox.
Public awareness of the drug's benefits were well known, he said. If
administered within 24 hours of the first signs of chicken pox, the drug can
reduce the number of lesions and the severity of the disease.
Dr Whitely added that doctors may well prescribe Zovirax, which cost between
Dollars 30 and Dollars 55 for a five day treatment, for fear of potential
litigation.
Chicken pox can lead to serious complications in a small minority of cases
and the drug may be able to prevent the disease or lessen its severity.
He warned that the drug's high cost and the problems of quick diagnosis
would prevent all patients receiving Zovirax.
