FT  23 NOV 92 / Letter: Pressure to hold down wages


   From Mr PETER INGRAM


Sir, Your editorial ('The gamble on UK pay', November 15) is correct to
identify wage growth as the source of the economy's current weakness. You
suggest that determination from management in the private sector is needed
to contain wage rises. This downward pressure has, over the last two years,
been much in evidence as private-sector companies, particularly those in the
traded sector, contained costs under the discipline of the ERM. With this
constraint relaxing, talk of initiatives directed at co-ordinating wage
outcomes and an 'incomes policy by exhortation' is already re-emerging.
The experience of the last decade suggests that such proposals would be
judged as unacceptable by management in the private sector, anxious to
retain control of the vital lever of industrial relations that wage
movements represent. As a result, any proposed initiative designed to
moderate wage growth must allow for the flexibility of outcomes required by
differing company circumstances. The best opportunity to enjoy this
dispersion in wage settlements, but around a lower nominal average increase
in earnings, might best be provided by pressure applied through pension fund
managers and insurance companies. At this level any benefits of a collective
approach might be better appreciated while the institutional investors would
also be best placed to regulate such a mechanism through the application of
pressure on their shareholdings.
Given the structure of corporate control in Britain, if there exists a need
for exhortation on pay or co-ordination of wage awards, it should emerge at
this level. This would provide the attraction of economically consistent
wage awards combined with the scope for flexibility while enabling the
private sector to control itself.
