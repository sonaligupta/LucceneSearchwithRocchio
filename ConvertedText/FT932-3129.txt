FT  16 JUN 93 / Somali leader may stand trial over UN ambush

   NEW YORK


GENERAL Mohammed Farah Aideed, the Somali warlord accused of directing an
ambush that led to the deaths of 23 Pakistani United Nations soldiers, will
be arrested and brought to trial if an official inquiry confirms the
allegations, the UN said yesterday.
Mr Kofi Annan, under-secretary general for UN peacekeeping operations, told
reporters: 'Whoever is found responsible will be apprehended, whether
general or foot soldier.'
The investigation ordered by the UN Security Council following the June 5
incident was continuing and if Gen Aideed were held responsible, an attempt
would be made 'to bring him in' perhaps to appear before an ad hoc Somali
tribunal.
At a press conference called to explain the bloody incident last weekend in
which many Somali civilians were killed by Pakistani troops, Mr Annan said
that non-lethal riot control methods had been considered. The situation 'got
out of control' when Somali demonstrators tried to tear down a UN barricade.
