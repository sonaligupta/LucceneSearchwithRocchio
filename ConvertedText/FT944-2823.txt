FT  15 DEC 94 / International Company News: Pentium PC sales strong despite
flaw, says Intel

   SAN FRANCISCO


Sales of personal computers based on Intel's flawed Pentium microprocessor
chip continued to be robust, in spite of negative publicity and the decision
by IBM to halt sales, US retailers said, writes Louise Kehoe in San
Francisco.
Although customers are asking questions about the chip flaw, they continued
to purchase Pentium PCs in rising numbers, Intel said. 'We have talked to
the leading retailers and they are reporting no slowdown in sales.'
Several leading PC manufacturers said they would continue to sell Pentium
PCs, in spite of IBM's contention that the flaw can cause frequent errors in
mathematical calculations used in spreadsheet and similar applications.
NEC, Japan's dominant personal computer supplier, and Fujitsu, its largest
computer manufacturer, have agreed to replace faulty Intel Pentium
microprocessors free of charge, adds Alan Cane. Some 150,000 Pentium-based
machines have been sold in Japan to date.
Olivetti, the Italian computer maker, said it would replace any faulty
Pentium chips, made by Intel and used in its own personal computers, with an
improved version of the microprocessor.
The computer unit of Germany's Siemens said it would offer help to customers
concerned about flawed Pentium chips from Intel.
