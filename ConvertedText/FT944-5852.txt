help

Seagram, one of the world's top four drinks groups, reported a strong third
quarter due to a bigger contribution from Du Pont, the US chemicals group in
which it has a 25 per cent stake, and higher spirits and wines income.
Net profit was USDollars 199m, or 53 cents a share, after Du Pont dividends
and unremitted earnings. In the 1993 period, Seagram posted a loss of
Dollars 100m, or 27 cents, after taking its share of Du Pont's special
charges.
Spirits and wines produced operating income of Dollars 193m, up from Dollars
181m a year earlier, and most brands gained market share, said Mr Edgar
Bronfman Jr, president. Profits rose in all areas except Latin America, and
the US and Asia-Pacific were up sharply.
But Tropicana, the juice business, contributed less because of aggressive
competition and the cost of international expansion.
Sales and other income from the drinks business totalled Dollars 1.51bn
against Dollars 1.47bn.
The third quarter includes a Dollars 35m charge related to the company's
continuing re-engineering program.
Seagram's nine-month net profit was Dollars 545m, or Dollars 1.46 a share,
against Dollars 232m, or 62 cents, after the special Du Pont charges in the
same 1993 period. The drinks business had sales of Dollars 4.17bn against
Dollars 4.05bn.
