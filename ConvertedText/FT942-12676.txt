FT  28 APR 94 / UK Company News: Losses increase to Pounds 1.1m at Haemocell


Losses at Haemocell, the USM-traded medical equipment maker, increased from
Pounds 868,000 to Pounds 1.1m in the six months to February 28.
Mr Andrew Priestley, chairman, said that as anticipated, the initiative to
re-establish direct control of sales and marketing arrangements for its
System 350 range had a substantial impact on the outcome.
This reflected a period of enforced sales inactivity as the process of
selection, appointment and training of new distributors continued.
Turnover dropped to Pounds 74,000, against Pounds 542,000 previously,
reflecting the company's inability to recommence sales initiatives until
very late in the period.
Product refurbishment and repackaging, together with expenses associated
with the re-establishment of an international distribution network kept
costs high. This was despite some temporary reduction in manufacturing
capacity facilitated by higher stock levels.
Losses per share deepened from 4.3p to 5.1p.
