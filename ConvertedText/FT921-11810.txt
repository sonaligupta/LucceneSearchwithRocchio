FT  30 JAN 92 / Parents' survey adds to student fees controversy


   By ANDREW ADONIS


MOST parents with incomes of more than Pounds 15,500 a year would be
prepared to contribute to the tuition costs of their children's higher
education, according to a Mori survey released by the Committee of
Vice-Chancellors yesterday.
The survey will fuel controversy on whether students should pay fees in
addition to those paid by the state.
At present, no higher education institutions charge such 'top-up fees'. Many
vice-chancellors would like to, but the committee has been reluc-tant to
support action that would mean breaking ranks.
The average amount those surveyed said they would pay was just over Pounds
1,000.
While 72 per cent said the government should spend more on each student,
respondents were evenly divided on whether the state should pay all the
extra teaching costs of expanding the universities.
Respondents ranked job training as the top priority for public spending on
education while higher education was ranked sixth.
