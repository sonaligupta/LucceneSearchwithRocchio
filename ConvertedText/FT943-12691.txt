FT  23 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Gibbs Mew expands estate with Pounds 12.8m
Centric buy


   By TIM BURT


Gibbs Mew, the Salisbury-based regional brewer, yesterday accompanied
sharply increased annual profits with the Pounds 12.8m acquisition of
Centric, the Midlands pub group.
The all-paper transaction, involving the issue of up to 3.21m ordinary
shares at 400p, will bring an additional 197 pubs into the group's estate,
taking the total to 318.
The move follows six months of talks with Centric, which was only formed in
1992 when it purchased 173 pubs from Bass.
Mr Tom Hedderson, chairman, said the deal would enable the USM-quoted group
to develop three core areas: brewing of traditional ales such as The
Bishop's Tipple; warehouse distribution and estate management.
'We have no ambition to be a mega-brewer, but this acquisition will allow us
to continue with steady and comfortable growth,' he added.
Gibbs Mew also moved to strengthen its balance sheet by announcing a Pounds
13.6m rights issue, which will be used to reduce borrowing. Gearing is
expected to fall from 65 per cent to 50 per cent - equivalent to pro forma
net borrowings of Pounds 20.4m - following the issue, in which existing
shareholders will be offered 4.28m ordinary shares at 340p. The shares fell
27p to 391p yesterday.
The issue, underwritten by Samuel Montagu with Panmure Gordon as brokers, is
being made on a 2-for-3 basis.
Once the acquisition and rights issue have been completed, the holding of
the Gibbs family and current directors is expected to fall from 64 per cent
to 35 per cent, while the shares issued to Centric will represent 23.1 per
cent of the enlarged capital.
Steady volumes in Gibbs Mew's west of England heartland and a full year's
contribution from UK D, the wholesaling operation, helped pre-tax profits
jump to Pounds 3.06m (Pounds 1.04m restated for FRS 3) in the year to April
2.
The figures were flattered by lower interest charges and a Pounds 363,000
(Pounds 154,000) profit on the disposal on surplus properties.
Nevertheless, Mr Hedderson claimed that operating profits of Pounds 3.74m
(Pounds 2.7m) on increased turnover of Pounds 33.9m (Pounds 28.7m) showed
that the brewer had defied a 2.5 per cent decline in national beer volumes.
Earnings per share rose from a restated 15.33p to 33.51p and a final
dividend of 5p makes a total of 8.75p (7.5p).
Centric, meanwhile, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 55,000 in the year to
March 26, against losses of Pounds 1.18m. Before interest payments on bank
and brewery loans, however, it made operating profits of Pounds 3.94m
(Pounds 2.76m).
