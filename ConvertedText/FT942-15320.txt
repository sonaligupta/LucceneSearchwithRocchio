FT  15 APR 94 / International Company News: BCE chief sees profit for full
year

BCE, the Canadian-based international telecommunications group, will report
a good first quarter during its annual meeting on April 27, said Mr Lynton
Wilson, chairman.
BCE, which recently completed the sale of Montreal Trust to the Bank of
Novia Scotia, will be profitable for all 1994, he added.
It will maintain the common share dividend at the current level.
The group plans to hold the 10m Bank of Novia Scotia shares it received for
Montreal Trust indefinitely, Mr Wilson added. They are now worth CDollars
275m (USDollars 199.2m).
BCE, which takes in the Bell Canada telephone utility and controls Northern
Telecom and other companies, has completed the disposal of virtually all its
non-core assets, including real estate.
It earned CDollars 1.3bn in 1992, but posted a final 1993 loss of CDollars
750m after special charges of CDollars 800m. Heavier long-distance
competition squeezed Bell Canada's profit.
Pennzoil of the US has counterbid CDollars 205m cash for all the shares of
Co-enerco, a restructured western Canada gas and oil company, sought earlier
by Numac Energy, of Calgary. The bid is higher than Numac's, and Pennzoil
would assume CDollars 104m in Co-enerco debt. Co-enerco has large
undeveloped natural gas reserves.
