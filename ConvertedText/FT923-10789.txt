FT  29 JUL 92 / Spain and Morocco to discuss immigrants


   By TOM BURNS


   MADRID


MR Javier Solana, the Spanish foreign minister, flies to Rabat, the Moroccan
capital, today for talks on the growing problem of African immigrants
entering Spain through Morocco.
He is the second Spanish minister to travel to Morocco in less than a week
to discuss the sharp increase in Africans using Morocco as a staging post
for illegal entry into Europe.
Mr Solana's trip follows a Spanish decision to take back 72 Africans
expelled from the Spanish-held enclave of Melilla on Morocco's Mediterranean
coast and refused entry by Morocco.
The refugees spent two weeks camping in no-man's land between the enclave
and the Moroccan frontier.
The decision, described as a humanitarian gesture by Spain, followed a
fruitless attempt by Madrid's interior minister at the weekend to persuade
Morocco to accept the refugees.
Under an existing agreement, the Rabat government will take back its own
nationals expelled from Spain but not illegal emigrants from other countries
unless police can prove that they attempted entry from Morocco.
A group of 50 people recently arrested after landing in a fishing boat in
southern Spain included Nigerians, Senegalese, Ethiopians, several who had
destroyed their personal documents and refused to reveal their nationality,
and only seven Moroccans.
So far this year about 500 illegal immigrants, the majority Moroccans, have
been picked up by coastguards as they reached Spain across the 30 mile-wide
Straits of Gibraltar.
As many as 50 are estimated to have drowned as they attempted the crossing.
Madrid has issued 60,000 work permits to Moroccans in Spain over the past 18
months and opened a soft credit line for Spanish companies investing in
Morocco.
