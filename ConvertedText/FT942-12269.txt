FT  30 APR 94 / Tory peer criticises finance bill verbiage


   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent


Lord Cockfield, the Conservative peer and former Treasury minister,
yesterday criticised the length and complexity of the finance bill as it
completed its passage through the House of Lords.
He contrasted the verbiage of the 259 clauses and 26 schedules in the
462-page bill with the brevity of the legislation that introduced the
pay-as-you-earn income tax regime in the 1940s. Lord Cockfield said that
only 10 or 15 pages had been needed to establish PAYE, which remained the
bedrock of the taxation system.
He said the impetus provided by earlier Conservative administrations to
simplify the tax system had been lost, and legislation was being introduced
that was 'more and more complex, more difficult and more unintelligible'.
Lord Cockfield called on ministers to devote more effort to the style of
legislation.
Lord Boyd-Carpenter, another Conservative peer and former Treasury minister,
said the tax increases in the Bill had been made necessary by the
government's failure to restrain expenditure.
The bill is expected to receive royal assent on Tuesday.
