FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Barcom Pounds 5m deficit


The costs of the reorganisation at its Hawkins Plant Services subsidiary and
higher interest charges resulted in a pre-tax loss of Pounds 5.1m at Barcom
in the year to September 30. This compared with profits of Pounds 2.06m
previously.
The civil engineering and plant hire group reported static sales of Pounds
31.4m for the period. There was an operating profit of Pounds 217,000
(Pounds 3.42m) but exceptional costs of Pounds 3.59m represented management
changes, depot closures and plant disposals related to Hawkins. In addition
interest took Pounds 1.78m (Pounds 1.5m).
Losses per share of 28.1p this time compared with earnings of 10.9p
previously and there is no dividend. Last year 3p was paid, including a
final of 1.75p.
