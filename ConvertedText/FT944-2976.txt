FT  15 DEC 94 / Observer: Folly bizarre


For sale: presidential palace, one previous elderly owner. Malawi's new
government is looking for someone to rent or buy one of Africa's most
remarkable follies - a 300-room palace, commissioned by the country's former
leader, Hastings Kamuzu Banda.
The erstwhile life president, whose autocratic style won him the nickname
'One Man Banda', will no longer be needing it - he was defeated earlier this
year in the country's first multi-party election since independence in 1964.
So New State House in the capital Lilongwe has been put on the market. It
'occupies a magnificent setting amongst vast beautiful landscaped (sic)
comprising immaculate grassed gardens complete with a summer pavilion,
terrazzo pavings and exotic flora', and comes with a banqueting hall capable
of seating 600 guests. All interested entrepreneurs are invited to write to
Box 30228, Lilongwe.
Sounds like a suitable retirement home for another elderly gentleman - the
one who used to run Lonrho.
