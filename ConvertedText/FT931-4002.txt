FT  12 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brokers expect bigger coffee
export quota for Indonesia

INDONESIA WILL receive a higher coffee export quota should producing and
consuming nations succeed in negotiating a new International Coffee
Agreement at the March 22-31 meeting in London, according to traders in
London.
Under the 1983 ICO agreement, which is due to expire in September but
effectively collapsed in 1989, Indonesia's quota was equivalent to 5 per
cent of world exports. Its production, however, has since risen and the
Association of Indonesian Coffee Exporters estimates that exports accounted
for 8.3 per cent of the world market over the past four years.
Brokers forecast Indonesia would receive a quota of about 300,000 tonnes a
year under a new agreement, equivalent to 7.1 per cent of estimated 1992-93
world exports of 4.2m tonnes and close to Aice's demand of 7.5 per cent.
The outcome of the London meeting remains uncertain, however. While the
European Community favours a new agreement, the US and Japan are undecided.
As one London broker explains, 'US officials still at heart prefer a free
market. On the other hand, they are annoyed at being put in limelight as
holding up an agreement. Japan will follow the herd'.
An increase in Indonesia's quota to 300,000 tonnes would assume a recovery
in its exports, which totalled just 264,172 tonnes in the 1991-92 crop year,
ending last September 30, a 30 per cent drop on the previous year.
Indonesia's 1992-93 crop is forecast at 511,920 tonnes by Aice, which
estimates last year's crop at 476,280 tonnes, figures trader say are too
high. 'If you believe in those figures you would see a lot of stock in
Indonesia at present and there isn't,' notes one London trader. More
conservative estimates put 1991-92 output at 400,000 tonnes and forecast the
1992-93 crop at 420,000 tonnes.
Aice officials say Indonesian exporters continue to be squeezed by low
prices and high interest rates. Fierce competition between traders has
resulted in a minimal margin between the farm gate price of Rp1,400-Rp1,500
(68-73 US cents) a kilogram for robusta beans, which account for 93 per cent
of Indonesia's production, and the world price of 74-80 cents a kilogram.
The situation may be eased if, as London traders believe, the world price
begins an upward trend as international demand exceeds supply. 'There is
much healthier outlook for coffee. Prices will go up even without an ICO
agreement,' maintains one trader.
Aice officials say Indonesian exports between last October and the end of
January totalled 57,577 tonnes. Exports will rise when the harvest begins in
April and farmers are expected to sell stocks to finance celebrations for
the on-going Moslem month of Ramadan.
