FT  21 NOV 92 / Finance & the Family: Health debut by insurance giant


   By JOHN AUTHERS


THE MARKET for permanent health insurance (PHI) got a boost this week when
the UK's largest mutual life insurer, Standard Life, offered a product for
the first time. And the Life Association of Scotland (LAS), which entered
the market last year, relaunched its scheme.
PHI is named awkwardly and might better be described as 'sick pay insurance'
or 'income replacement.' It pays out an income while you are unable to work,
and tends to be of most use to those who are self-employed or in the
professions. (Those employed by large companies may well have adequate cover
in place already).
State provision is unlikely to be adequate for anyone with extensive
financial commitments as it offers sickness benefit of only Pounds 66.70 a
week for the first 28 weeks of disability, and an invalidity pension of
Pounds 108.40 thereafter.
The industry standard is to pay a maximum of 75 per cent of your income.
Insurers will not pay a whole salary because they feel this could encourage
people not to return to work.
Premiums are cheaper the longer you are prepared to have off work before
receiving an income. The new Standard Life policy offers deferred periods of
13, 26, 52 and 104 weeks. LAS also offers a deferred period of only four
weeks, which will interest those who might need a replacement income most
quickly.
Premiums will also be affected by your age when you start the policy, and
your job. Standard Life will charge a 30-year-old male accountant a monthly
premium of Pounds 15.23 for benefit payments of Pounds 12,000 a year,
payable once he has been out of work for 13 weeks. This drops to Pounds
12.18 if he is prepared to wait 26 weeks for replacement income.
For cover of Pounds 20,000 a year, these figures rise to Pounds 23.98 and
Pounds 18.90 respectively.
