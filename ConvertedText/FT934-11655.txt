FT  30 OCT 93 / Customs traces Pounds 1.96bn of VAT


   By ANDREW JACK


CUSTOMS AND EXCISE narrowly failed to meet its target of tracing Pounds 2bn
in underpayments of value added tax, its 1992-93 annual report says.
It traced Pounds 1.96bn, out of a total of Pounds 63.5bn in VAT and duties
raised during the year, up from Pounds 62.2bn in the previous 12 months.
Costs rose to Pounds 879m from Pounds 797m.
There were 1.63m traders registered for VAT during the year, down from
1.68m, with new registrations totalling 187,000. Total tax written off or
not pursued rose to Pounds 825m from Pounds 553m. Customs said the increase
reflected the effects of the recession and also cases being processed more
quickly.
There were 1,058 civil cases of VAT evasion, representing arrears of Pounds
17.2m, and 136 criminal cases which led to the imprisonment of 110 people. A
total of 5,320 appeals were made to VAT tribunals from Customs' assessments,
of which 1,806 were decided at a full hearing, with 431 found fully in
favour of the taxpayer and 43 allowed in part.
The running costs of gathering trade statistics under the new EC single
market initiative were Pounds 14.7m, against a planned Pounds 15.9m.
During the year Customs seized consignments to Iraq in contravention of UN
sanctions valued at Pounds 181,606. It brought prosecutions against a
company and its owner for the export of riot gear to Angola without export
licences. It seized more than Pounds 3m worth of strategic goods such as
military and high technology industrial equipment and atomic energy
materials.
The number of people searched at the borders of the UK fell 35 per cent to
36,646.
The 15.5m litres of unleaded petrol released for consumption was for the
first time almost equal to the amount of leaded petrol - 16.6m litres, down
from 19m litres in the previous year.
