FT  11 APR 94 / World Bond Markets: Frankfurt


   By ATONIA SHARPE


German government bonds gained around 0.25 per cent in local currency terms
last week, according to Salomon Brothers' world government bond index,
helped by the Bundesbank's continued step-by-step declines in the repo rate
and the improvement in market sentiment since the start of the second
quarter.
The Bundesbank cut the repo rate by three basis points to 5.73 per cent last
Wednesday, in line with forecasts, but analysts said the move was marred by
the Bundesbank's misjudgment of the liquidity situation in the money market.
Contrary to market expectations, the Bundesbank drained a net DM1.8bn from
the system on Wednesday but it was forced to allocate DM7bn via a seven-day
repo the morning after.
Traders expect the yield curve to steepen this week as rate cut speculation
mounts ahead of the Bundesbank's council meeting on Thursday. The Bundesbank
has scheduled a press conference after the meeting at which it is expected
to announce its 1993 profits, thought to be around DM20bn.
There is speculation that the Bundesbank will announce a half-point cut in
the emergency Lombard funding rate, which has remained at 6.75 per cent
since last October.
