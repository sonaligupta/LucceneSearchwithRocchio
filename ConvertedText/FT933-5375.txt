FT  03 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Vickers back on the right road with profits
of Pounds 8m


   By KEVIN DONE and ANDREW BOLGER


VICKERS, the UK engineering group, ended two years of losses by achieving a
pre-tax profit of Pounds 8.3m in the first six months following a deficit of
Pounds 4.1m in the same period last year.
Sir Colin Chandler, chief executive, said that Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, the
luxury cars operation, was 'on track to break even' in the full year after
suffering total losses in the last two years of Pounds 110m, including
trading losses and restructuring costs.
The interim dividend is raised from 0.5p to 1.25p. Last year's total was cut
to only 1.5p from the peak of 9.9p paid in 1990.
Group turnover in the half year to end-June fell by 5.4 per cent to Pounds
330.5m (Pounds 349.3m).
Vickers was 'back on the path towards gradual earnings growth,' said Sir
Colin. Trading conditions had shown 'little sign of improvement' but the
group was benefiting from the 'significant' cuts in its cost base and the
strengthening of operational management.
Vickers said that sales of Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars were unchanged in
the first six months at 693, ending the dramatic decline of the previous two
years when sales worldwide plunged to only 1,378 in 1992 from the peak of
3,333 in 1990.
Sir Colin said that in the long term, the luxury cars business would need to
find some form of partnership in order to develop a new model generation.
The Cosworth engines subsidiary has suffered from a sharp fall in demand for
road engines from Ford, which has fallen to about 3,000 this year from 9,000
two years ago.
The decline has been offset by the growth of the motorsport business,
however, with successes in both Formula 1 and the IndyCars series in North
America.
Vickers had still not received 'a firm response' from the UK government in
its negotiations over a Pounds 500m contract either to supply more
Challenger 2 tanks or to upgrade the British Army's existing Challenger 1
tanks, said Sir Colin.
COMMENT
Vickers is clearly back on the right road, but the route to recovery still
involves considerable uncertainties. March's Pounds 60.5m rights issue has
cut gearing to 6 per cent, but individual businesses such as marine and
aviation face tough markets conditions. Rolls-Royce Motor Cars should break
even, but a welcome increase of sales in markets such as China and the
former Soviet Union may prove unreliable. The big Challenger contract could
also fall foul of a public expenditure squeeze. Forecast profits of about
Pounds 32m put the shares on a prospective multiple of 21. The shares, up 5
1/2 p to 160p yesterday, have risen strongly since the rights issue, which
was priced at 95p, and now look fully valued.
