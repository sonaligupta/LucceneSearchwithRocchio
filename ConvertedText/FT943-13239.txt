FT  20 JUL 94 / International Capital Markets: CS First Boston repays
Dollars 40m loss on derivative


   By TRACY CORRIGAN


CS First Boston's asset management arm has repaid around Dollars 40m to
three clients after breaching investment parameters agreed between the bank
and the institutions on a number of derivative-related trades, sources close
to the bank said.
The investments involved are believed to have been securities with embedded
derivatives, such as bonds with returns linked to stock indices or foreign
exchange rates. The investments were severely hit by the recent turmoil in
the financial markets.
The breaches were apparently discovered by the internal compliance
department of CS First Boston.
Mr Keith Walsh, the manager in charge of the accounts, and Mr Nicholas
Bogard, a director of CS First Boston Investment Management, have been
dismissed as a result of the losses, which have resulted in a Dollars 40m
pre-tax write-off.
The Dollars 40m was not related to recent small losses at the First Boston
Institutional Money Market Fund, the management of which also involved Mr
Walsh.
CS First Boston Investment Management, the bank's asset management arm, has
Dollars 22bn under management worldwide.
