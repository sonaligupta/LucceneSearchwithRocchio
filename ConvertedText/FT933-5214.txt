FT  04 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Banks cash in on their WPP conversion
shares


   By ANDREW BOLGER


BANKS immediately sold most of the ordinary shares in WPP Group they
received yesterday by converting preference shares in the market services
company.
SG Warburg, the stockbroker, bought 46.9m shares at 93p and placed them at
94p with 60 institutions in the UK, US and Europe. WPP's shares closed 7p
higher at 102p.
WPP said later it had obtained a listing for 57.76m new ordinary shares in
the company to satisfy conversion rights. The shares placed yesterday
represent 8 per cent of the group's diluted share capital.
This was the first opportunity for banks who supported WPP's debt-for-equity
swap last year to book a profit on some of their preference shares.
Shares in WPP have more than doubled this year as hopes of recovery have
improved. However, the group last month remained cautious about an upturn in
its markets.
