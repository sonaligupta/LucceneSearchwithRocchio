FT  10 JAN 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Sewage sludge a slick business


   By DELLA BRADSHAW


SEWAGE sludge is a problem most people try to ignore. But with legislation
to be enforced in the EC in 1998 which forbids the dumping of sludge at sea,
European water companies are not looking at alternative methods of disposal.
One that promises to bring economic as well as environmental benefits turns
the sludge into a medium fuel oil, similar to diesel, which could be used to
drive low-speed engines, fire furnaces or even generate electricity.
The 'oil from sludge' process involves heating dried sludge to 450 deg C in
the absence of oxygen, which vaporises 50 per cent of the sludge. These
vapours are then mixed with the char residue which converts the organics in
the sludge to saturated hydrocarbons, the main ingredient of all liquid
fuels.
Promoters of the technique say it costs up to Pounds 32 per tonne to dispose
of the dried sludge, compared with at least double that amount for
incineration. Capital and running costs are also reduced.
The first plant incorporating the technique will be built in Canada this
year. In the UK and Ireland Acer Consultants, of Guildford, and the
Australian company Campbell Environmental, are providing engineering
services for plants using the technology.
