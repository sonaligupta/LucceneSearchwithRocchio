FT  16 MAR 94 / Strike hits S Africa gold mine for second day


   By MATTHEW CURTIN

A strike over free political activity halted underground work at the Kloof
mine, one of South Africa's most profitable gold producers, for the second
day running yesterday. Kloof is responsible for about 5 per cent of the
country's gold output of 620 tonnes a year.
The strike, by 11,000 of the mine's 16,000 workforce, is the biggest in the
sector since 1991. It comes in the middle of a campaign by the National
Union of Mineworkers to win concessions from Gold Fields, Kloof's parent
company.
An NUM official said workers had given a list of grievances, including an
alleged ban on political activity on mine property. The union had not
received a response and this had led to the strike. A Gold Fields official
said the management had responded.
Gold Fields has before now declined to take part in the industry's wage
bargaining forum, unlike the rival mining houses Anglo American, Gencor,
Johannesburg Consolidated Investment and Randgold.
