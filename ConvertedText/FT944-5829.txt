FT  01 DEC 94 / Markets Report: Australian and NZ dollars touch long term
highs


   By PHILIP GAWITH


Antipodean currencies were the main movers on the foreign exchanges
yesterday as the prospect of higher interest rates drove both the Australian
and New Zealand dollars to long term highs, writes Philip Gawith.
The Australian dollar touched a 31-month peak, after third-quarter GDP
reached the highest level in 10 years, while the New Zealand currency posted
a four-year high after the Reserve Bank hinted at the prospect of higher
interest rates.
Sterling rallied slightly after Tuesday's Budget to finish in London at
DM2.4578, from DM2.4475, but it closed at Dollars 1.5652 from Dollars
1.5678.
Elsewhere, the dollar showed little response to the release of third-quarter
GDP, industrial production and capacity utilisation figures. It ended at
DM1.5703, from DM1.5612, after the Commerce Department revised its estimate
of third-quarter growth up to 3.9 per cent from 3.4 per cent. In New York it
closed at DM1.5700.
In Europe, the D-Mark remained weak under pressure from the firmer dollar.
The French franc closed at FFr3.431/DM from FFr3.432. Outside the ERM, the
lira continued to strengthen, touching a high of L1,028.45/DM at one stage,
while the Norwegian krone maintained its post-referendum strength, ending at
NKr4.351/DM from NKr4.356.
The general consensus among City economists was that the Budget was positive
for sterling, especially in the longer term. Chase Manhattan entered the
caveat that this was 'more a reflection of the well-balanced economic
recovery to date than any inspiration in the Budget.'
NatWest Markets said: 'Most relevant (for sterling) were Mr Clarke's growth
estimates (and more specifically the implication for interest rates) and the
more optimistic outlook on the trade front.'
It noted that revised current account deficits for 1994 and 1995 represented
just  1/2 per cent of GDP, compared to 1 3/4 per cent in 1993. 'This is a
significant change for the UK and sterling, a currency that has had to fight
against significant current account deficits through the latter half of the
1980s and early 1990s.'
NatWest concluded its assessment on an optimistic note, saying: 'It may just
be that the 1994 Budget statement will be looked back upon as the first in
which sterling was no longer considered a constantly depreciating asset.'
Midland Global Markets also set out the positive case for the pound, asking
rhetorically: 'How many developed western economies can offer good growth,
now balanced towards net exports and investment rather than consumption, a
current account improving towards surplus, low inflation and rapidly
improving public finances?'
Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, cautioned that
political uncertainty would probably place a cap on sterling's gains.
There were some in the market who expected a rise in interest rates as early
as yesterday. This accounted for the firming of cash rates, with three-month
LIBOR finishing at 6 1/4 per cent, up from 6 1/8 per cent. Mr Richard
Phillips, analyst at broker GNI, estimated that around 30 per cent of his
clients expected rates to rise next month, while 90 per cent expected higher
rates by the end of January.
The New Zealand dollar closed in Wellington at a four-year high after a
signal from the Reserve Bank caused a jump in interest rates, with the
currency following suit. The 'Kiwi' closed at USDollars 0.6283/90, off its
high of Dollars 0.6291 but substantially above its opening of USDollars
0.6232/39.
The Australian dollar hit a 31-month peak after GDP data showed economic
growth running at a 10-year high. Australia's annual growth rate surged to
6.4 per cent during the September quarter, the highest since 1985. The
figure would have been even greater, around 7.3 per cent, had it not been
for the impact of a severe drought.
The growth heightened expectations of further interest rate rises, and the
Australian dollar rose on the back of this. It gained nearly  1/2 cent in
Australian trading, breaking through a key technical resistance level at
USDollars 0.7663. It ended in London at USDollars 0.7685.
The Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 280m late
assistance. Earlier it had injected Pounds 144m liquidity at established
rates, after predicting a Pounds 550m shortage.
