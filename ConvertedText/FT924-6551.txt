FT  20 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Banks pull out of commodities


   By DAVID BLACKWELL


THE NUMBER of banks involved in financing international commodity
transactions in London has fallen to just a dozen from about 30 over the
past 2 1/2 years, a London conference was told this week.
'This rapid fall-out of banks has caused some of the commodity trading
companies in the industry considerable pain and has even meant ultimate
demise on occasions,' Mr Guy Saunders, senior manager, commodity and trade
finance at ANZ Bank, told the conference, organised by Moores Rowland, the
accountancy firm, in association with World Commodity Report.
The cut in the number of successful commodity traders companies and banks
committed to the industry meant 'the past few years have been extremely
turbulent and unstable from a financial perspective.' But he thought that
the remaining banks would continue to support the industry.
