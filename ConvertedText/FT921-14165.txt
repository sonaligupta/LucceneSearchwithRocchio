FT  17 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: German regulation


The Bonn Finance Ministry was surely right to assert yesterday that
Germany's regional stock markets can compete internationally only if they
are regulated from the centre. The requirements of the European single
market and the need to attract capital to finance unification both mean that
the outside world can no longer be ignored. Whatever happens to the detail
of yesterday's reform proposals, the power of the Lander is waning
inexorably. More important, the same could also be true for the banks.
The ministry may not have offered much to satisfy international investors
over the flagrant if perfectly legal discrimination against minority
shareholders in cases such as the Krupp takeover of Hoesch. But it is
proposing a tighter and much more interventionist regulatory regime than
that operated by the Lander, who have allowed the banks considerable leeway
in setting standards of market practice.
Worse still for the banks is the proposed creation of money market funds,
long opposed by the Bundesbank on the grounds that it would weaken its
control over the money supply. The banks' concern is more prosaic but
nonetheless real. They fear it would push up the cost of their liabilities
in a market where they are already having to cope with the new attractions
of commercial paper.
