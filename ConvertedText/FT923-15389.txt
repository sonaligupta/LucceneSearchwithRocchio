FT  02 JUL 92 / Whitehall aims to protect tea ladies


   By ALISON SMITH


TEA ladies and messengers were described in a Whitehall department's
response to the Citizen's Charter unit as core services that could not be
subjected to market testing.
That reaction is one of the reasons that Mr William Waldegrave, the public
services minister, is considering the publication of a league table showing
how far government departments have met the targets for market-testing their
functions.
The aim of market-testing is to ensure that the costs of providing services
internally are clearly identified, so that they can be compared fairly with
the private sector, instead of being obscured behind a global figure for
overheads.
Although the overall mood of the Downing Street seminar on the Citizen's
Charter, chaired by Mr John Major just over a week ago, was positive, senior
ministers were said to have been disappointed by departmental consideration
of how to move forward on market-testing and contracting out.
Almost all departments were said not to have reached the targets set for
market-testing, and Sir Peter Levene, the part-time head of the prime
minister's efficiency unit, has started a fresh round of discussions with
officials intended to put more pressure on departments to take the
initiative more seriously.
If the results of that are still unsatisfactory, then a series of
ministerial meetings with Mr Waldegrave will be set up.
Officials made clear that there would have to be several qualifications to
the rankings, to take account of how far a department had already contracted
out services and which of the remaining areas could not be contracted out.
