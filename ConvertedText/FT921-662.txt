FT  27 MAR 92 / Observer: Goodbye Peter


It is a bit off that Peter Drew should be bundled out of the Taylor Woodrow
chairman's seat with such unseemly haste.
One minute he is looking forward to eventual retirement as chairman of what
is still one of Britain's most respected construction companies, even ifdown
on its luck. The next he is retired with immediate effect and the board's
'best wishes'. After 26 years'
service, the top man might surely have been given more than 24 hours to
clear his desk, however bad a job he has done.
Heaven forbid, but could the swiftness of his exit have
anything to do with the end of the tax year on April 5 and the possibility
of a Labour
government a few days later? One assumes that the company is being more
generous with his settlement than it was with his period of notice.
