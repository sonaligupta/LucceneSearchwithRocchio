FT  04 AUG 92 / Abbey National falls 12% to Pounds 270m


   By DAVID BARCHARD


ABBEY NATIONAL, the mortgage lender and retail banking group, yesterday
reported a 12 per cent fall in its pre-tax profits during the first half of
the year as a result of the deep recession in the housing market.
Pre-tax profits in the six months to June 30 slipped to Pounds 270m, in line
with the lower end of market expectations, from Pounds 308m a year ago.
The dividend was increased by a larger-than-expected 9 per cent to 3.8p from
3.5p in spite of a fall in earnings per share to 13.2p from 15.7p. a year
ago.
The higher dividend failed to cheer the stock market, however, and Abbey
National shares fell 3.5p during the day to close at 255p.
Provisions against problem loans were Pounds 138m, up from Pounds 58m a year
ago and Pounds 97m in the second half of 1991. The figure included a general
provision of Pounds 30m, up from Pounds 3m a year ago, for UK residential
mortgages, and a further Pounds 30m in provisions against losses in France
and Spain and unsecured lending in the UK.
Sir Christopher Tugendhat, chairman, said: 'With the continuing depressed
state of the housing market so apparent, no one should be surprised that the
charge for provisions has increased and caused a fall in our pre-tax
profits.'
Mr Peter Birch, chief executive, hinted that borrowers who took out high
loan-to-value mortgages might have to pay higher rates to reflect risk more
accurately and offset the reduced protection available from mortgage
indemnity insurers.
The bank's treasury operations contributed Pounds 38m to pre-tax profits, up
from Pounds 20m a year ago.
Total operating income rose 12 per cent to Pounds 744m, from Pounds 663m a
year ago.
Costs rose 134 per cent to Pounds 336m, taking the cost:income ratio to 45.2
per cent, slightly up on 44.8 per cent a year ago but still well below the
big four clearing banks.
During the first half of the year, Abbey National's net mortgage advances
were Pounds 1.2bn, down from Pounds 1.7bn a year ago.
As a result, Abbey National's share of new UK mortgage advances has shrunk
to 10.9 per cent from 15.5 per cent at the beginning of the year. The bank's
share of the liquid savings market also fell from 7.9 per cent to 5.6 per
cent over the same period.
There was a net inflow of only Pounds 700m in retail savings during the
half-year, compared with Pounds 2.2bn a year ago.
