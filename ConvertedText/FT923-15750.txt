FT  01 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Efta and Czechoslovakia go ahead with
trade pact


   By FRANCES WILLIAMS


   GENEVA


A FREE trade pact between Czechoslovakia and the European Free Trade
Association (Efta) comes into effect as planned today,despite uncertainty
over the future of the Czech and Slovak republics.
Mr Hans-Jorg Renk, Efta spokesman, said both sides would pursue 'business as
usual', pending a review of the accord in September. Efta officials hope
that, whatever happens, the two republics will maintain a customs union and
common currency, making renegotiation of the pact unnecessary.
Efta, grouping Austria, Finland, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Sweden and
Switzerland, also hopes this month to conclude negotiations on free trade
pacts with Hungary and Poland. Mr Renk said talks with Hungary had made good
progress, despite earlier complaints by Budapest that Efta countries were
insisting on tougher terms than the EC, with whom Hungary, Poland and
Czechoslovakia all have association accords.
Outstanding problems concern trade in farm goods, where Efta countries have
shown themselves reluctant to open their markets to cheaper east European
produce.
