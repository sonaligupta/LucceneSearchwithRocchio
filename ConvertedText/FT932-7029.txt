FT  26 MAY 93 / Planning deals scrutiny urged


DEVELOPMENT benefits sought by local authorities in return for granting
planning permission often go beyond government guidelines and are not
subject to sufficient public scrutiny, says a study published today by the
Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the social research organisation.
It warns that the 'integrity of the planning system could be undermined if
arrangements come to be seen as a way that developers buy permission from
the council'.
