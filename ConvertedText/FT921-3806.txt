FT  12 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Canada toughens line against US in Gatt


   By FRANCES WILLIAMS


   GENEVA


CANADA yesterday seized on a debate in Gatt about US trade policy to pursue
trade grievances against its powerful neighbour. Mr Gerald Shannon, Canada's
ambassador to Gatt, said the US seemed to be drifting towards managed trade
and greater protectionism. He singled out US anti-dumping and countervailing
duty laws, which had become the 'instruments of choice for US industries
seeking protection', citing 'arbitrary and capricious' findings of injury,
dumping and subsidy.
Mr Shannon's remarks follow rising US-Canada trade friction. Canada was
yesterday considering retaliatory action against the US for last week
imposing countervailing duties against allegedly subsidised softwood exports
from Canada. Ottawa is also angry at a US customs decision that Honda cars
assembled in Canada do not qualify for tariff concessions. A report by the
Gatt secretariat on US trade policies will be published today.
