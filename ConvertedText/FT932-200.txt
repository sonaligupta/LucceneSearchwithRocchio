FT  30 JUN 93 / Major opposes News at Ten move


   By MICHAEL CASSELL


THE PRIME minister yesterday put his weight behind growing opposition to
plans by the ITV companies to move News at Ten to the early evening.
In a letter to Sir George Russell, chairman of the Independent Television
Commission, the industry watchdog, Mr John Major warned that switching the
bulletin to an earlier slot would seriously impair the authority of ITV's
news programming.
Number Ten's intervention, which means a full-scale political offensive is
under way to make the television companies change their mind, follows unease
among Labour and Tory politicians that the move would leave the BBC with an
effective monopoly of peak-time news coverage.
Mr John Smith, Labour leader, yesterday released a letter he sent to the ITC
last week expressing concern at the move. He warned in his letter: 'If the
projected change were to take place it would mean that the fears about the
quality of independent broadcasting which the Labour party voiced during the
passage of the Broadcasting Act have proved totally justified.'
Downing Street emphasised yesterday that it was primarily concerned to
ensure that the provision of evening news programmes remained subject to a
competitive environment.
ITV wants to move the programme to 6.30pm or 7pm because present scheduling
complicates the televising of films and drama after the 9pm watershed.
