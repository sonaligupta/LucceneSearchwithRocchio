FT  21 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Simplistic view of rail situation


   From Dr CHRIS ROWLEY


Sir, The FT's coverage of the railway signal workers' dispute (such as
'Signal workers reach crucial turning point', July 13) is over-simplistic.
It continues to ignore that:
The RMT union has little option but to pursue the long-standing grievances
of the signal workers, particularly as these workers had their own union in
the past.
If Railtrack forces a cessation of the strikes, it may not end grievances
and conflict in the signal boxes.
Fewer, larger, hi-tech signal boxes, each covering many miles of track, will
greatly enhance the strategic power of the remaining signal workers in the
future.
