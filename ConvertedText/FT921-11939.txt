FT  29 JAN 92 / Building societies suffer Pounds 54m net outflow


   By DAVID BARCHARD


FIGURES RELEASED by the Building Societies Association yesterday suggest
that societies may face even tougher market conditions than expected during
the next few months.
The association's monthly figures show that there was a Pounds 54m net
outflow of savings from societies last month, compared with Pounds 49m in
November.
Two successive months of savings outflows are extremely unusual, and they
suggest that societies may find it more difficult than they expected to cut
their savings rates in the wake of the 0.55 percentage-point cut in their
standard mortgage interest rates 10 days ago.
Mr John Wriglesworth, building society analyst at UBS Phillips & Drew, the
stockbrokers, said: 'These results show that building societies may have to
rely heavily on wholesale funds from the commercial money markets this
year.'
Mr Mark Boleat, director-general of the association, said the pattern of
building society savings in December had been distorted by the BT flotation
at the beginning of the month.
Total mortgage lending by the societies last month was 14.8 per cent lower
at Pounds 3.22bn than it had been in November. Net new loans - agreed but
not yet paid out - fell even more sharply, dropping from Pounds 3.04bn in
November to Pounds 2.53bn.
'The figures suggest that lending will be subdued in the next few months,'
Mr Boleat said. Mortgage lending by Britain's nine leading banking groups
rose by Pounds 3.6bn in the fourth quarter of last year compared with a
Pounds 4.5bn increase in the third. The British Bankers' Association said
the fall reflected the depressed state of the housing market.
The number of new mortgages approved fell from 76,100 in the third quarter
to 64,400 in the fourth.
