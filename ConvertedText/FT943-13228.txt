FT  20 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Japanese equities make a
modest improvement

Share prices fluctuated in a narrow range on small-lot trading by domestic
institutions, and the Nikkei 225 average closed marginally higher after
selling by financial institutions erased some of the earlier gains, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index was up 57.52 at 20,775.16 after a day's peak of 20,851.87 in the
morning and low of 20,736.35 in the afternoon. The Topix index eased 0.71 to
1,664.30 as some financial institutions liquidated trading positions. The
Nikkei 300 slipped 0.20 to 302.09.
Volume totalled 260m shares, against 213m, and advances outscored declines
by 510 to 452, with 213 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
put on 2.83 at 1,351.59.
Traders said the Nikkei 225 would move in a narrow range until the currency
markets indicated the direction of the yen/dollar rate.
Salomon Brothers in Tokyo said that while the higher yen would prompt
profit-taking from foreign investors, it might not be as strong as in the
third quarter of 1992 when the European Monetary System collapsed. But with
some profit-taking limiting the upside of share prices in the short term and
buying by domestic investors preventing a sharp plunge, the Nikkei is
expected to be range bound for the next several months.
Toray Industries rose Y8 to Y780 on reports that it would double its
production of colour filters for liquid crystal displays. Other textile
makers also improved as laggard stocks. Teijin moved forward Y10 to Y567 and
Nitto Boseki Y13 to Y357.
Sumitomo Chemical gained Y8 at Y534 on reports of a decline in its operating
loss, while Nabco, a car and train brake maker, jumped Y58 to Y611 on news
of firm profits.
Foreign investors sold some high-technology issues, which were later bought
by domestic institutions. Casio Computer shed Y40 to Y1,280 but Matsushita
Electric Industrial ended Y30 ahead at Y1,780.
In Osaka, the OSE average firmed 8.42 to 23,203.84 in volume of 19.7m
shares. Kyocera, the semiconductor packaging maker, climbed Y70 to Y7,410.
Roundup
Mixed activity with few apparent trends dominated the Pacific Rim markets
yesterday.
TAIPEI failed to build on Monday's strength as profit-taking took hold. The
weighted index dipped 7.07 to 6,526.39 in turnover of TDollars 119.02bn,
after Monday's TDollars 131.04bn.
Profit-taking was heavy in financial stocks, which had gained more than 3
per cent the previous day.
Elsewhere, China Steel rose TDollars 1 to TDollars 28.60 on news that it had
secured Dollars 423m in loans from German and British banks. ICBC retreated
TDollars 2 to TDollars 88 on heavy profit-taking.
SEOUL saw some gains in smaller capitalised shares, although the market
closed lower for a fifth consecutive session due to a lack of institutional
activity.
The composite stock index lost 5.75 at 939.05 as investment trust companies
extended their sell-offs ahead of an August 10 deadline to repay part of
their borrowings to the central bank. A warning by the securities watchdog
of a crackdown on price manipulation also deterred many institutions.
HONG KONG finished moderately lower but bargain hunting, particularly in
HSBC Holdings, helped to trim losses. The Hang Seng index was finally off
48.82 at 9,145.01.
HSBC, in demand by European investors on expectations of positive interim
results being reported next month, was 75 cents firmer at HKDollars 90.50
after touching HKDollars 91.
Uncertainty about local property prices and worries about an upward trend in
US interest rates remained the major concerns. Among property issues that
encountered profit-taking, Sun Hung Kai Properties declined 60 cents to
HKDollars 48, Henderson Land 50 cents to HKDollars 39.20 and Hongkong Land
45 cents to HKDollars 20.10.
MANILA continued to improve on a technical rally, now in its fourth session.
The composite index added 18.25 at 2,669.06 in turnover of 677.56m shares
worth 914.79m pesos. Rising issues outpaced losers by 31 to 28.
Second-line stocks topped the list of gainers, with retail-based SM Prime
Holdings leading the way by climbing 5.4 per cent to 5.90 pesos. Benpres,
which has holdings in Meralco and broadcast company ABS-CBN, jumped 2.15 per
cent to 9.50 pesos.
PLDT led blue chips with an advance of 1.6 per cent to 1,535 pesos.
SYDNEY managed to recoup opening losses to notch up its fifth consecutive
gain. The All Ordinaries index, down 11 points at the start, closed a net
5.1 firmer at 2,077.4.
On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the September share price index contract
recovered to finish only 3 off at 2,097 after 2,076. National turnover came
to 176.2m shares worth ADollars 374.9m.
Austereo was the most traded industrial stock with almost 3m shares changing
hands: it opened at a 4 per cent premium before closing at 89 cents, down a
cent from its issue price of 90 cents.
Goodman Fielder rose 4 cents to a two-month high of ADollars 1.43, and was
the second most traded industrial holding.
In the banking sector, NAB slipped 14 cents, or 1.2 per cent, to ADollars
11.24, ANZ lost 2 cents to ADollars 4.26, Westpac was steady at ADollars
4.82 and Commonwealth Bank added 9 cents at ADollars 8.09.
WELLINGTON consolidated to end marginally lower after a strong run on Monday
and late last week. The NZSE-40 capital index lost 6.75 at 2,027.71 on
turnover of NZDollars 29m.
The main stocks were marginally weaker with the exception of Telecom, which
gained a cent at NZDollars 4.64.
BANGKOK finished a day dominated by speculative trade higher. The SET index
improved 3.74 to 1,348.94, with interest centred on finance and blue chip
issues.
BOMBAY recovered from early losses to close higher on late buying by local
mutual funds. The BSE 30-share index gained 16.74 at 4,114.85 after an
intraday low of 4,078.67.
Indian mutual funds, mainly Unit Trust of India, were said to have bought
select blue chips, including Tata Iron and Steel, Rs5 ahead at Rs290 on
takeover expectations.
KUALA LUMPUR drifted to a lower close in thin trading as investors who
bought at higher levels looked to cut their losses.
The composite index failed to hold above the psychological 1,000 support
level, ending 5.85 down at 999.20 in thin volume of 69m shares.
SINGAPORE saw the broad market weaken on profit-taking, although demand for
some index heavy issues took the Straits Times Industrial index 5.77 ahead
to 2,204.92. Volume was light at 64.3m shares.
