FT  08 JUN 92 / Foreign Exchanges and Money Markets: Focus on jobs data


   By JAMES BLITZ


Although the markets reacted pessimistically to Friday's non-farm payroll
data for May, traders will probably discuss the finer details of the
indicator this week, writes James Blitz.
There are plenty of other US statistics for the market to chew on in the
week, including May's producer prices figures due out on Thursday and the
same month's consumer prices figures due to be released at the end of the
week. But last Friday's non-farm payroll report had been seen as a vital
indicator of the strength of the US recovery, and will still need digesting
by dollar investors.
Analysts said that there was renewed pressure on the Federal Reserve to ease
interest rates and boost recovery after the non-farm payroll report showed
that US unemployment had surged to 7.5 per cent in May from 7.2 per cent in
April. The dollar responded by falling over a pfennig against the D-Mark to
DM1.5880.
But Michael Feeney, of Sumitomo Bank, believes that the upward revision for
the April payroll to 182,000 from 126,000 makes the overall picture
brighter, and expects the markets to respond to this more fully. 'If you
average out the revisions it all washes out,' he says. 'The Fed needs more
than weak money supply figures for an ease, but these jobless figures are
not weak enough for that.'
Trading in European Monetary System currencies is also certain to dominate
attention, after Denmark's decision not to participate in European Monetary
Union caused a flight into D-Marks. The German currency's rise appeared to
be firmly based by the weekend. The UK's retail prices index due out on
Friday, which is expected to show a second consecutive monthly rise, could
shake sterling further.
