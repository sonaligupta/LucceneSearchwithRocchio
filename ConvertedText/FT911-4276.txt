FT  20 APR 91 / World News in Brief: Hammer falls on Bounty


Australia's sinking economy has forced the replica of Captain William
Bligh's ship Bounty to go under the auctioneer's hammer, its owners said.
The replica, buit in 1979 by film-maker Dino De Laurentis bought by a
consortium in 1986, will be auctioned in Sydney on June 20.
