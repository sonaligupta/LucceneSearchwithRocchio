FT  26 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Hardys & Hansons declines 8%


Hardys & Hansons, the Nottingham-based brewer, reported an 8 per cent fall
in pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.45m to Pounds 3.16m in the 26 weeks to
April 3.
The result was after a halving of dividend income and net interest
receivable to Pounds 488,000 (Pounds 974,000).
Turnover improved to Pounds 14.3m (Pounds 13.4m). Directors said that on a
like-for-like basis, excluding recently-purchased public houses, sales had
been down in line with the market, but the additional pubs had helped to
increase trading profits by 8 per cent.
Although earnings per share declined to 8.479p (9.183p) the interim dividend
is stepped up from 2.68p to 2.8p.
