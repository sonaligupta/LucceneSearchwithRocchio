FT  19 APR 94 / BBC may resume Far East TV link


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


BBC World Service Television hopes to resume its satellite television
service to the Far East from London within the next few months.
The service on the northern beam of the Star satellite system covering areas
such as China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and the Philippines was switched off at
midnight last night following a deal with Mr Rupert Murdoch's Star TV.
The BBC said it had received several hundred faxes and a large number of
telephone calls expressing disappointment at the ending of the service.
The BBC decided to give up the northern beam of the satellite system early
in order to win an extension for the service carried on the southern beam to
India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
Mr Murdoch wanted the channel capacity ahead of the break point in the
contract with the BBC at the end of this year to launch a Chinese language
film service aimed at Taiwan.
When the BBC went off the air to the Far East on Sunday night it was with
the promise to viewers: 'We will be back.'
The BBC has since been offered the possibility of a number of satellite
transponders which could carry its service to much of the region.
The corporation is also talking to cable operators in two of its main
markets, Hong Kong and Taiwan, about carrying World Service Television.
Mr Chris Irwin, chief executive of World Service Television, has not yet
decided whether to try to restore his service on a piecemeal basis or to
wait for a satellite with the same broad coverage as that provided by the
Star system.
