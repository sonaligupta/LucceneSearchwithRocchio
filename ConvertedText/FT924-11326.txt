FT  27 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Onerous disposal problem for Storehouse


   By JOHN THORNHILL


STICHTING Ingka Foundation, Habitat's purchaser, may be a charitable
institution but it is certainly no slouch when it comes to tough talking.
Although the purchase price of Pounds 78m - including repayment of Pounds
24m of inter-company debt - was Pounds 7m above Habitat's net book value,
SIF succeeded in leaving Storehouse with some onerous responsibilities for
disposing of unwanted properties.
Storehouse is taking an extraordinary provision of Pounds 5m to cover the
cost of closing an unspecified number of Habitat stores should Habitat
subsequently decide it does not want to trade from them or chooses to
relocate elsewhere. This also includes some sites which have already ceased
trading.
Mr David Simons, finance director, said it might take up to two years to
dispose of these properties although he emphasised that the Pounds 5m
provision was a conservative estimate that reflected the maximum potential
liability.
Separately, Storehouse has also agreed to retain the freehold and leasehold
interests of several other properties which have a book value of Pounds 14m.
Storehouse will continue to receive rental income from the tenants until it
can dispose of these properties to institutional investors.
'One of the bits of baggage that Habitat has been carrying around has been
that quite a lot of the stores are in poor locations. We could not expect
Ikea to take them all on,' said Mr Simons.
Overall, the effect of disposing of Habitat and Richards will lead to a
reduction of Pounds 20m in shareholders funds but a Pounds 100m net cash
inflow.
Mr Simons, who was responsible for straightening out the group's tangled
balance sheet, has amicably agreed to leave next March. He will be succeeded
by Mr Graham Rider, finance director of BhS.
