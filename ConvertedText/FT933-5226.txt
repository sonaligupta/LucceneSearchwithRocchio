FT  04 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Isotron rise puts 20p on share price


IMPROVED sales in all markets helped Isotron, the Swindon-based
sterilisation company, report a 14 per cent advance in pre-tax profits for
the year to June. The shares rose 20p to 270p.
On turnover ahead 12 per cent at Pounds 7.31m (Pounds 6.51m), profits were
up from Pounds 2.74m to Pounds 3.11m. Earnings per share were 17.3p (14.8p)
and a final dividend of 2.83p is proposed for an increased total of 4.34p
(3.94p).
The cash balance increased over the year to Pounds 4.5m despite paying for
substantial cobalt purchases in the second half and the capital cost of a
new gas sterilisation plant in the Irish Republic.
On prospects Mr Colin Clive, chairman, said that interest income would be
lower because of capital spending in Ireland. However, the year had started
well and with the UK economy showing signs of improvement he said operating
profits should continue to progress.
