FT  15 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold market higher


THE gold market has turned higher in the past two months for good
fundamental reasons, Mr Robert Guy, director of NM Rothschild, told the
conference. Central bank sales were seen as less of a threat and the mining
industry was more confident.
Investors had been slow to react but they had returned to the market and
appeared unconcerned by the fall in physical demand. The gold price,
however, was low enough to attract more demand once buyers were used to the
level, said Mr Guy.
Mr Brian Marber, an independent technical analyst, said gold met all the
criteria for a bull market. He suggested it would end only in the event of
the afternoon fix on the London bullion market falling below Dollars 339.60
a troy ounce (the level at which it stood when the one-month average started
to rise) 'in which case a test of the March low at Dollars 326.10 would be
likely to follow'.
