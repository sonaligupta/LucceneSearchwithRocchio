FT  16 NOV 93 / Business school reduces its deficit


   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent


MANCHESTER Business School ended its 1992-93 financial year with a deficit
of Pounds 111,779 on Pounds 11.03m of income, after cutting costs in the
wake of last year's controversy over proposals to federate the school with
parts of Manchester University. In 1991-92 the school achieved a surplus of
Pounds 238,439.
The school was heading for a deficit of Pounds 326,700 at the end of March,
Pounds 706,700 under budget. But it cut costs from Pounds 11.22m to Pounds
11.14m to help offset a 4 per cent fall in income.
The accounts show gross income from short courses run for experienced
managers fell more than Pounds 600,000, or 13 per cent, to just under Pounds
4m. These are generally paid for by employers and are therefore likely to be
less in demand in a recession.
There was a 19 per cent fall in course fees, from Pounds 1.35m to Pounds
1.09m, from UK and other European Union students taking the school's Master
of Business Administration postgraduate degree. This was offset by more
non-EU students taking MBA places, producing a 27 per cent rise in income to
Pounds 1.03m.
Professor Martin Harris, who took over as the university's vice-chancellor
after last year's controversy, said yesterday a Manchester Federal School of
Business was planned for October next year. The business school would be
able to operate as usual within the federal school and would benefit from
the economies of scale.
