FT  20 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Euro Disney


Perhaps Euro Disney's 'imagineers' should be called in to build a fairy tale
set on which investors feverishly purchase the company's own shares. The
reality - witness yesterday's heavy turnover in which 1 per cent of the
stock changed hands and the priced sagged a further 7 per cent - is
continuing stock market disenchantment with this Mickey Mouse venture.
One might almost feel sorry for the company if it had not been so complacent
in the first place. After all, the combination of a nominal dividend and the
deferral of Walt Disney's base management fee is a sign that management is
now desperately trying to please.
The 2.2 per cent prospective yield, though, is of little serious help in
valuing the shares. In the absence of a reliable earnings stream even the
soothing words about record attendances for a Disney start-up may not
silence the bears. Recent assurances about the high proportion of British
visitors, indeed, seem rather less convincing in the context of sterling's
depreciation. The best hope for the shares is that most of the weak holders
have now been shaken out. But a stock like Euro Disney, bought by the
professionals for short term trading, is always going to test the nerves of
small shareholders clinging on for the long term ride.
