FT  05 AUG 93 / Government Bonds: Hopes of rate easing sustain bund progress


   By SARA WEBB and PATRICK HARVERSON


   LONDON, NEW YORK


GERMAN government bonds made further headway yesterday, prompted mainly by
hopes that the Bundesbank would cut its key discount rate towards the end of
the month, although the success of the latest 10-year bund auction provided
an additional tonic.
Hopes of a Bundesbank easing were fuelled by the central bank's allocation
of 14-day and 28-day securities repurchase agreements, with the market
taking cheer from the minimum rate of 6.7 per cent on the 28-day tranche.
This is below both the 14-day rate of 6.8 per cent and the discount rate,
currently at 6.75 per cent.
'The 28-day rate of 6.7 per cent attracted a lot of attention, and created
the expectation of a discount rate cut of between 75 to 100 basis points on
August 26 (when the Bundesbank council returns from holiday),' said Mr
Julian Callow, European bond and currency analyst at Kleinwort Benson.
Meanwhile, dealers said the new 6.5 per cent 10-year bund issue was
well-received. The average price at the auction was 100.52 and the average
yield was 6.43 per cent.
ELSEWHERE in Europe, the recent bond market frothiness appeared to have
subsided.
French government bonds ended lower ahead of today's auction of 10-year and
30-year stock. The main talking point remains the question of when the
Banque de France will see fit to cut interest rates.
The September 10-year futures contract ended 0.18 lower at 121.76, while the
10-year OAT yield ended 1 basis point above the bund yield, compared with 2
basis points through the bund yield the previous day.
The high-yielding government bond markets, which have rallied strongly since
the weekend agreement to move to wider fluctuation bands in the European
exchange rate mechanism, ran out of steam yesterday and gave up some of
their early gains.
UK government bonds fell back on profit-taking with short-dated issues
weakening as the much-wanted interest rate cut failed to materialise.
THE RECENT rally in Japanese government bonds took a breather yesterday as
the yen receded slightly against the US dollar. Dealers reported
profit-taking as the dollar strengthened to just over Y105. The September
JGB futures contract, which opened at 111.39, reached a high of 111.49 and
then fell to close at 111.15.
PROFIT-TAKING following Tuesday's big gains and concerns about the passage
of President Bill Clinton's budget depressed prices at the long end of the
US bond market yesterday.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  15/32 at
107 15/32 , yielding 6.548 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was
down  1/32 at 100 5/32 , to yield 4.151 per cent.
After Tuesday's solid advance in long-dated securities, an advance which
temporarily pushed yields to new record lows, investors took the opportunity
yesterday to book some profits in early trading.
Prices were also under pressure from reports that a key Democrat senator was
leaning towards voting against Mr Clinton's budget package. The passage of
the budget hangs in the balance, and the loss of support of a few Democrats
could scuttle its chances of approval.
In the morning many participants stayed on the sidelines until the afternoon
release of the quarterly refunding announcement. When the Treasury unveiled
its refunding programme, however, there was little reaction from the market.
Its make-up was in line with expectations.
THE London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (Liffe) has
suspended the December 1993 delivery month of its Spanish government bond
futures contract, pending a review of the contract.
