FT  04 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Homework at the Abbey


Sir Christopher Tugendhat's rescue plan for the housing market looks more
like a grand gesture from the politician he once was than an expert
pronouncement from the mortgage lender he has now become. The plan is right
to home in on the lack of liquidity in the housing market as harmful to
consumer confidence. But it is otherwise so flawed that one wonders why
Abbey National chose to launch it with such fanfare. It certainly did not
need the distraction from a respectable set of interim results.
Suppose the government were persuaded to use income tax credits to
compensate people for selling their houses at a loss. That would relieve
homeowners caught in the negative equity trap, but it would cost a great
deal more than the Pounds 250m which Sir Christopher suggests. While market
turnover would almost certainly increase, net new demand would probably be
marginal and confined to bargain hunting by first time buyers.
A more obvious advantage would accrue to lenders. With their loans
effectively underwritten by the government, the quality of their assets
would improve. Presumably the Abbey itself could unwind some of its first
half Pounds 30m general provision against bad debts. But, even if the plight
of lenders were the government's main interest in considering the scheme, it
could surely find a cheaper way of helping them.
Besides, it is not remotely as if Abbey itself is in need of such
assistance. Granted provisions are up 42 per cent on last year's second
half, and the bank is still relying on low margin treasury business to
offset the drop in its retail profits. But Abbey has done well to confine
itself to a fall of 12 per cent in pre-tax profit compared with the first
half of last year. There cannot be many financial institutions able to raise
their dividends by nearly 9 per cent and still cover the payment more than
three times.
