FT  22 JUL 94 / People: National Federation of Enterprise Agencies


Lord Young, executive chairman of Cable & Wireless and a former Trade and
Industry Secretary, is to become president of the National Federation of
Enterprise Agencies.
The organisation speaks on behalf of 130 enterprise agencies throughout
England which provide business services to small and medium sized
enterprises.
The agencies are coming under some budgetary pressure as funds supporting
their support services are being diverted into the Single Regeneration
Budget which the government hopes will improve the coherence of its
inner-city regeneration policies.
Michael Heseltine, a successor of Lord Young at the DTI, is keen for the
Enterprise Agencies to integrate with Training and Enterprise Agencies and
Chambers of Commerce into the government's one-stop-shop Business Link
network.
