FT  27 OCT 92 / Yeltsin rules out economic policy change


   By REUTER


   MOSCOW


PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin yesterday ruled out changes to the government's
radical economic reform programme but said certain ministers could be
removed, Itar-Tass news agency said, Reuter reports from Moscow.
Mr Yeltsin is under increasing pressure from conservatives to sack key
members of acting Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar's government and adopt
alternate economic policies. He told American bankers and financiers that
'the strategy of Russian reforms is irreversible,' Tass said.
Mr Gaidar on Sunday effectively ruled out a big reshuffle before December.
