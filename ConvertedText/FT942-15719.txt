FT  14 APR 94 / Mersey Docks director resigns


   By STEWART DALBY


Mr Peter Vincent yesterday resigned from the board of Mersey Docks and
Harbour Company only six months after joining the company following MDHC's
takeover of his Medway Ports company, Stewart Dalby writes.
Mr Vincent's resignation from MDHC, in which he owned nearly 1 per cent of
the ordinary shares and was thought to be the largest private
non-institutional shareholder, was said to be so he could develop 'other
interests'. Mr Vincent's appointment was surrounded in controversy because
of the terms of the takeover.
MDHC purchased Medway Ports, which has docks in Sheerness and Chatham in
Kent, for Pounds 104m in September 1993, valuing the shares at Pounds 37.50,
making Mr Vincent's own holding worth Pounds 12m.
But 270 dockers - out of a workforce of 600 - dismissed in November 1992 for
refusing to accept new working practices had been obliged to sell back to
the company before the takeover for Pounds 2.50 each shares they had been
given or bought at privatisation in March 1992. They thus missed out on
profits made by Mr Vincent and other employees.
The Pounds 2.50 valuation was reached by the accountants KPMG Peat Marwick.
In March this year, the sacked dockers won a ruling for unfair dismissal
from an industrial tribunal and are to receive Pounds 10,000 each.
The dismissed dockers are taking legal advice as to whether they can use
section 459 of the 1985 Companies Act - which refers to unfair treatment of
minority shareholders - to apply for rectification of the shareholders
register. They are also seeking legal advice over whether to pursue a claim
that KPMG was negligent in valuing the shares at Pounds 2.50.
