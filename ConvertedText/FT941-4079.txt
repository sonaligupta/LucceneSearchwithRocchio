pension (industry average 1.6 per cent)
Penalties on early retirement or termination: Yes, where commission is paid
on regular premium plan, cost of that commission is recouped in full. Also,
an extra charge if contract terminated within first two years. No charges

Charges: At present life office illustrations of what your investment may
produce use a standard basis for charges set by Lautro (the Life Assurance
and Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation). To reveal the impact of real
charges on the final fund of Standard Life's managed unit-linked plan, we
asked for illustrations using actual charges for a man age 45 who expects to
retire at age 65 (ie, a 20-year contract), paying (a) Pounds 200 per month
and (b) a stand alone single premium of Pounds 10,000.
Illustrations using Lautro standard charges, which in fact are lower than
those used by most life offices, are shown in brackets. The last
illustration gives a theoretical value if no charges were deducted.

Full commission paid

                           6% growth        12% growth

Monthly premium        Pounds 75,096    Pounds 147,480
Pounds 200            (Pounds 80,900)  (Pounds 158,000)
Single premium         Pounds 24,773    Pounds 76,476
Pounds 10,000         (Pounds 28,200)  (Pounds 85,200)

Monthly premium        Pounds 79,201    Pounds 158,711
Pounds 200            (Pounds 80,900)  (Pounds 158,000)
Single premium         Pounds 25,805    Pounds 79,610
Pounds 10,000         (Pounds 28,200)  (Pounds 85,200)

Theoretical no charges
 ---------------------------------------------------------
Monthly premium
Pounds 200             Pounds 91,129    Pounds 183,971
Single premium
Pounds 10,000          Pounds 32,071    Pounds 96,463
 ---------------------------------------------------------
As can be seen, where full commission is paid, Standard Life's charges are
significantly higher than the Lautro basis, yielding a lower projected
return. When the commission cost is stripped out, the reverse is true on the
monthly premium plan at the higher growth rate but elsewhere Standard Life's
charges are still higher than the Lautro basis. The life office's charges
are above the industry average on regular and single premium unit-linked
contracts for virtually all investment periods but are lower than average on
longer term with-profits contracts.
