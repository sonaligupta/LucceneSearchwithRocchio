FT  01 DEC 94 / The Budget: Tecs hail funding change as boost for unemployed


   By MOTOKO RICH


Unemployed adults should get jobs and vocational qualifications more quickly
under the performance-related funding scheme for training announced in the
Budget, training and enterprise councils said yesterday.
But the councils, the employer-led bodies responsible for training in
England and Wales, said they were disappointed that the chancellor had cut
funding by 18 per cent.
The Tecs had sought Pounds 705m to run Training for Work, the scheme for
unemployed adults, in 1995-96, but the chancellor announced that the budget
would be Pounds 578m. Of this, 75 per cent will depend on candidates getting
a job, gaining a qualification or entering full-time higher education.
At present about 70 per cent of funding is received on a weekly basis,
regardless of how the trainee fares. Under the new system, putting a trainee
into a job will yield the highest payment and the government will also pay
the Tecs more for training people with special needs, such as the long-term
unemployed or the disabled.
Trials of performance-related funding at seven Tecs have produced
encouraging results. Mr David Rossington, chief executive of Lincolnshire
Tec, said the proportion of trainees getting jobs improved from 30 per cent
to 50 per cent.
Mr David Cragg, Birmingham Tec chief executive, said: 'If you pay by the
week, you are constraining training providers to use up a maximum number of
weeks per candidate. With outcome-related payment the provider has more
flexibility to customise programme lengths to individuals.'
But Tecs are concerned that the funding cuts will limit their training
provision. Mr Chris Humphries, chief executive of the Tec national council,
said: 'We are worried that the reduction in funding will make it more
difficult for Tecs to provide the longer and higher level skills training.'
