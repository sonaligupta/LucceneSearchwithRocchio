FT  20 APR 94 / International Company News: French and German groups in
robotics deal


   By JOHN RIDDING


Groupe Schneider of France and AEG Daimler-Benz Industrie of Germany are to
pool their robotics businesses in a joint venture, the companies announced
yesterday.
The new company, to be called AEG Schneider Automation, will have annual
sales of about FFr3bn (Dollars 508m) and will employ 3,000 people, according
to Schneider.
The French electrical engineering group said the joint venture would rank
second in the international market for automated engineering equipment and
robots.
Schneider said the new company would group its Telemecanique and Square D
operations. AEG Daimler-Benz Industrie, the electrical engineering unit of
Daimler-Benz, will provide its AEG Modicon subsidiary.
The two groups declined to comment further, ahead of a more detailed
announcement due tomorrow. But industry analysts said the move should
strengthen their presence in the international market, giving them a
combined market share of about 12 per cent.
'In the robotics business it is essential to gain critical mass to be able
to cover the significant R&D costs arising in a business which has little
series production,' said an analyst at Societe Generale in Paris.
In spite of the advantages, industry observers said question marks remained.
In particular, they said that the joint venture could mean the closure of
production sites in Germany and that Schneider may have to accelerate its
rationalisation process in France.
Yesterday's announcement is the latest move in a restructuring of the
international robotics industry.
Last year, Asea Brown Boveri, the Swedish-Swiss engineering group, acquired
the robotics operation of Renault, the French state-owned car group, and
formed a joint venture in automated vehicle assembly.
