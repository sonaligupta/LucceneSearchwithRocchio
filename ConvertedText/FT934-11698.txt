FT  29 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome plunges


   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY


Fears over underlying sales growth in Wellcome sent shock waves through the
market and cut the share price by just over 11 per cent - equivalent to
nearly five Footsie points.
The results were largely in line with expectations, but some analysts feared
that sales growth could be less than 10 per cent in the current year and
many forecasts have been trimmed. The dividend was increased, but the level
of that rise also disappointed many investors.
One industry watcher feared more downside and warned that the stock had
received a bounce from currency factors but its future would depend on its
product portfolio.
Some analysts suggested that 700p would become a realistic price for the
shares and yesterday the price plunged very close to that figure, losing 91
to close at 712p. At one point the stock had fallen 100p to touch 703p.
Turnover was a hefty 18m, the highest level since July 1992.
However, there were some optimistic voices for Wellcome who considered that
part of the steep slide could be attributed to the volatile state of the
sector. Reflecting the confused feeling, the range of profits forecasts for
next year was said to stretch between Pounds 690m and Pounds 760m,
indicating that there is still some bullish sentiment surrounding the
shares.
Wellcome's ill wind blew a little good Glaxo's way and its shares gained 10
at 692p in turnover of 4.6m. The stock also benefited from a strong
performance on Wall Street. Zeneca also improved, adding 5 at 780p. In spite
of announcing consolidation of its R&D operations, SmithKline Beecham 'A'
lost 2 to 420p.
