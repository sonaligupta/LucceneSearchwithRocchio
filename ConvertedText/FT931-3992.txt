green tea


   By KUNAL BOSE


   CALCUTTA


INDIA, THE world's biggest tea producer, hopes to widen the market for its
green tea through the adoption the CTC (crush, tear and curl) manufacturing
method previously confined to black tea.
Green tea is traditionally produced by the orthodox method which is
cumbersome, expensive and somewhat unhygienic.
It has now been commercially established, however, that the processing cost
is nearly halved if it is manufactured the CTC way. The cuppage is increased
by about three times and tasters have confirmed that CTC green tea produces
excellent liquor and has an appetising green colour.
Essels Tea, which owns gardens in north Bengal, will be marketing CTC green
tea internationally for the first time in the present season.
Almost all the 8m kg of green tea produced annually in India is exported.
