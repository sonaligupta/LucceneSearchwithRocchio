FT  04 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: GEC weak on cautious comment


   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON


A CAUTIOUS statement on trading conditions by Lord Prior, GEC's chairman, at
the company's annual meeting yesterday, triggered a flurry of selling
pressure in the shares.
Already weakened in the past few sessions by a Kleinwort Benson
recommendation that clients 'take profits', GEC tumbled from 347p to 342p in
fairly heavy trading before stabilising and edging off the bottom to close a
net 5 down at 344p. Turnover in the stock reached 5.1m shares.
Analysts were surprised by the caution expressed by Lord Prior, who told the
meeting that profits in the first half would be lower than for the same
period last year.
'It was essentially a bearish message from the company,' said one
specialist, who added that GEC's annual meetings are generally low key
affairs. 'There are worries about the performance of the telecoms and power
systems businesses, a deterioration in Austria and Switzerland and the fact
that there is no pick up in the company's early-cycle businesses, such as
washing machines. The only positive was news that overall orders are
slightly above those of last year and that interest income is higher,' the
analyst said.
