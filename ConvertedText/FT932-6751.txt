FT  27 MAY 93 / Actuaries rap OFT disclosure plan


   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent


THE professional bodies for actuaries have criticised the Office of Fair
Trading's proposals for disclosure of life insurance charges.
The English Institute of Actuaries and the Scottish Faculty of Actuaries,
many of whose members are employed by life companies, said a requirement for
prospective customers to be told the value of their policy if they surrender
early could be too easily misunderstood.
They also urged the OFT to continue to allow companies to show prospective
customers charges based on the industry average, rather than on their own
costs. However, they urged that a company's own charges be shown in a
different form.
The actuaries' criticisms of the proposals are in line with those from the
life insurance industry.
In March, the OFT ruled that proposed disclosure rules for the sale of life
insurance tell consumers too little about the costs of each product for them
to make wise choices, and thus restricted genuine competition in the
industry.
Consumer groups and some regulators have said that the lack of cost
disclosure has led to excessive 'mis-selling' because consumers do not
understand the products they buy. Too often, they cancel policies in the
first few years, when company charges absorb nearly all the premiums paid.
Mr Chris Hairs, chief actuary at life insurers Legal and General and deputy
chairman of the institute's life assurance joint committee, said: 'We agree
with the concerns stated in the OFT reports.'
