FT  26 JUN 92 / High growth in first quarter lifts few spirits


   By MICHAEL PROWSE


   WASHINGTON


THE US Commerce Department yesterday revised up its estimate of economic
growth in the first quarter to an annual rate of 2.7 per cent, the best
performance since President George Bush took office early in 1989.
However, the revision failed to lift the spirits of many forecasters who are
worried by more recent evidence that growth is again flagging.
Mr Michael Boskin, the chief White House economist, yesterday warned that
the risk of 'sluggish growth' was greater than that of a resurgence of
inflation. He also expressed concern about the slow growth of the money
supply.
His remarks added to the pressure on the Federal Reserve to ease monetary
policy, following Mr Bush's direct call this week for lower interest rates.
Separate reports yesterday of a sharp rise in claims for unemployment
insurance and a decline in sales of previously-owned homes gave further
evidence of sluggish conditions.
Unemployment claims rose by 16,000 to 422,000 in the week ending June 13.
Sales of existing homes fell 1.7 per cent in May to register their second
consecutive monthly decline.
The third and final estimate of growth in the first quarter contrasted
favourably with previous estimates of 2 per cent and 2.4 per cent. The
improvement reflected upward revisions to investment and net exports.
This was the fourth consecutive quarter of sluggish growth after a faltering
economic recovery in the spring of last year. GDP expanded at an annual rate
of 0.4 per cent in the final quarter of last year.
Many analysts fear that the 2.7 per annual growth rate recorded in the first
quarter will not be sustained in the current quarter, mainly because of a
deceleration in consumer spending.
