FT  21 APR 94 / Moulinex to shed 333 kettle jobs


Moulinex, the French kitchen appliance manufacturer, is to close its
Moulinex Swan kettle plant in Birmingham, with the loss of 333 jobs, the
company said yesterday.
The company blamed the decision on 'old-fashioned machinery and
infrastructure, along with severe problems encountered in updating the
technology', and on 'financial difficulties resulting out of the general
recession and continued losses in the UK'.
Mr John Allen, executive council member of the AEEU engineering and
electrical union, said: 'This is another instance where a foreign company
has taken over an established British company, used its trade names and then
closed the company down.'
