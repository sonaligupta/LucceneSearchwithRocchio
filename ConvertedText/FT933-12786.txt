FT  22 JUL 93 / UK Company News: BA to franchise its brand name to smaller
airlines


   By DANIEL GREEN


BRITISH AIRWAYS is to franchise its name to small independent airlines,
starting with UK carrier Cityflyer, in a move that mimics the strategy of
its large US rivals.
Cityflyer will sell all its scheduled services under the British Airways
Express brand name. It will pay BA a royalty for its use and for marketing
services.
It will keep its staff and financial independence but switch to BA livery
and uniforms. The airline already has a sales and reservations deal with BA.
Mr Robert Ayling, BA managing director, said yesterday that the deal was
attractive because 'capital was not at risk and income is guaranteed.
'We have seen this work successfully in the US and we are looking at at
least one other possible (similar) transaction'.
American Airlines, for example, franchises the name American Eagle to small
carriers which then feed local services into American large hub airports.
BA's next target for a franchise is likely to be Maersk, the Danish carrier.
The two airlines have close links and between them control Brymon European
Airways, formed last year from the merger of Plymouth-based Brymon Aviation
and Birmingham European Airways.
Cityflyer formerly operated flights for the holiday tour operator
International Leisure Group, until that went bust in 1991. It was saved by a
management buy-out and now flies to Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany,
Ireland, the Channel Islands and within the UK.
The deal is part of BA's strategy to cut costs in less profitable
activities. Recent changes include moving maintenance from Heathrow to
Cardiff Airport, and the establishment of BA Regional to operate flights out
of non-London airports with staff on lower wages.
