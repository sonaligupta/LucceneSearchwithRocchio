FT  07 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold market surrenders its new
year gains


   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent


Gold's price yesterday lost all the gains it had made since the begining of
the new year as computer programmes used by some US institutional investors
sent out 'sell' signals.
In London the price dropped to Dollars 385 a troy ounce at one stage before
recovering slightly to close at Dollars 388.75, down Dollars 7.75.
Some analysts suggested the drop merely represented a badly-needed pause for
breath before gold and other precious metals continued their upward climb
towards key levels: Dollars 400 for gold and Dollars 5.30 an ounce for
silver. However, Mr Ted Arnold, analyst at the Merrill Lynch financial
services group, warned that 'physical demand for gold is dropping like a
stone' at recent price levels. 'The higher gold prices go the more physical
offtake is likely to fall in both Asia and the Middle East.'
Mr Arnold said Saudi Arabians had been big buyers of gold and silver in the
past few months as a hedge against possible devaluation of their currency.
That threat had eased and 'much of this gold and silver is now showing a
good profit and is likely to be disinvested at higher price levels'.
Silver, which led the precious metals up and then down again this month,
closed in London last night down 17 cents an ounce at Dollars 5.07. However,
by mid-day in New York it was rising again. Some traders said this was
because it had earlier held above a key support level: Dollars 4.96 an
ounce.
One trader told Reuter that two investment funds that liquidated their
positions in the gold futures market did not have silver positions.
