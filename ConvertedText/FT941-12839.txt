FT  28 JAN 94 / Man in 'homes for votes' row found dead


A former Westminster city councillor who was one of 10 people named in the
district auditor's report alleging gerrymandering in council house
allocations, was found dead in his flat from gunshot wounds, police said
yesterday.
Dr Michael Dutt, former chairman of the council's housing committee, was
found at his home in St Albans, Hertfordshire, on Wednesday. An inquest will
be held on Monday.
His death comes two weeks after a district auditor's report into allegations
that the Tory flagship council ran a homes-for-votes scheme. Dr Dutt, a
43-year-old single man, recently pulled out of legal moves to clear his name
from the vote-rigging scandal.
The auditor, Mr John Magill, accused Dr Dutt, five other serving and former
councillors and four officers of being involved in 'disgraceful, improper
and illegal' behaviour which cost Westminster taxpayers Pounds 21m.
Dr Dutt was a member of the Royal College of Physicians who had worked as a
consultant specialising in the care of the elderly at St Albans City
Hospital for the past 10 years.
Mr Alan Harris, director of operations at the hospital, said Dr Dutt had not
been at work since the Westminster report appeared two weeks ago.
Dr Dutt served on the council from May 1986 to May 1990. He stood as Tory
parliamentary candidate for Leicester South at the general election in 1992,
coming second to Labour. In the 1989 Euro-elections he failed to win
Strathclyde East.
