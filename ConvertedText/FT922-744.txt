FT  26 JUN 92 / Turks to debate air cover for Kurds


   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN


   ANKARA


THE Turkish parliament is today to debate whether to renew the allied air
umbrella which has been vital for the security of the Iraqi Kurds.
The count is expected to be close, despite calls to extend air cover from Mr
Suleyman Demirel, the coalition prime minister, and a recommendation from
the National Security Council on Tuesday. Under the present agreement, US,
French and British fighter aircraft based at a Turkish-US base 310 miles
from the Iraqi border police the skies over northern Iraq to protect Kurds
from Iraqi military attack.
Together with the Kurdish Pesh Mergas guerrillas, the allied air threat has
been the main deterrent to President Saddam Hussein since western forces
left northern Iraq last July. Their departure followed a relief operation to
establish safe havens for the Kurds after the Gulf war.
The allied presence is credited with preventing a repeat of last year's
refugee exodus, which is still Ankara's main concern and persuaded Turkey to
back allied moves to set up the 'safe haven'.
Turkish nationalists on both the conservative and left wings remain opposed
to the presence of any foreign troops on Turkish soil. The Social Democratic
Populists (SHP), now the junior coalition partners, spoke against theaccord
when it was introduced during the former Motherland party government. 'We
didn't ask them to come here,' said Mr Erdal Inonu, the deputy prime
minister and SHP leader. 'Nevertheless we will be responsible for the
consequences.'
When the protocol was rolled over last December, Mr Demirel said it would be
for the last time. The prime minister also promised any decision would
depend on parliament's sanction, whereas previously the government used
special powers granted during the Gulf crisis.
