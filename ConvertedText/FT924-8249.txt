FT  12 NOV 92 / International Company News: Campbell Soup under fire in
Australia


   By KEVIN BROWN

CAMPBELL Soup's hostile bid for Arnotts, the Australian biscuit maker, took
a fresh turn yesterday when Mr John Dawkins, the federal treasurer (finance
minister), criticised Campbell's record in Australia.
Mr Dawkins said the federal government would be 'very closely involved' in
the decision on whether to allow the bid, which is subject to approval by
the Foreign Investment Review Board (Firb).
He said Campbell was 'very much under the spotlight', and suggested the US
food group had failed to keep promises to the Firb when it acquired its
existing 32.9 per cent stake in Arnotts in 1985.
Campbell is offering ADollars 8.80 a share for the 17.2 per cent stake
required for control of Arnotts. The bid, which has been rejected by
Arnotts, values the group at ADollars 1.2bn (USDollars 857m).
Arnotts representatives met Mr Dawkins last week to draw attention to
promises the company says were made by Campbell in 1985, including an
undertaking not to seek to control the board and a pledge to use Arnotts
recipes in its European operations.
Mr Dawkins said last month that Campbell's plans to use Arnotts as a
springboard for expansion into Asian markets would be central to his
decision on whether to allow the bid to proceed. He suggested yesterday that
Campbell might not need a bigger stake in Arnotts to increase its
involvement in the Asia Pacific market. 'I think that will need to be
tested, particularly in the light of Campbell's somewhat indifferent record
of sticking to its earlier commitments,' he said. Mr Dawkins also said
Arnotts's export performance had been 'pretty disappointing.'
The Firb, which approves about 97 per cent of foreign investment proposals,
has been under pressure to reject the bid to maintain ownership of Arnotts
within Australia.
