FT  06 AUG 93 / International Company News: Bechstein future rests on
property dispute


   By JUDY DEMPSEY


   BERLIN


BECHSTEIN, one of the world's most famous piano makers, could be rescued
from bankruptcy if it can resolve a property haggle with Berlin's ruling
body.
The dispute centres on the status of property owned by Bechstein which the
city's senate has first option to buy-back.
Bechstein, which filed for bankruptcy on July 22, is in desperate need of
about DM40m (Dollars 23.5m). It is owed DM9m in outstanding payments. It has
recently paid 1.5m to its former staff after liquidating a small piano
company in Bavaria.
It cannot pay its staff in Berlin. Dresdner and Deutsche
Genossenschaftsbank, its house bankers, are unwilling to extend a DM3m to
DM4m credit line. And its turnover will plummet by DM5.5m-DM15m this year.
In 1988, Mr Karl Schulze, a master piano maker who bought Bechstein back
from the US Baldwin piano company, acquired a new site for his factory not
far from the western side of Checkpoint Charlie. The property was bought
from the senate for DM19.6m. Bechstein has today a small mortgage of DM2.5m.
But Bechstein is not free to sell the property to raise capital.
'The purchase contract states that in the event of re-sale of the property,
the senate has first option, and at a minimum price,' explained Mr Leo
Durici, Bechstein's sales manager. The senate is looking into the market
value of the property. Mr Durici said it might offer about DM40m.
One banker yesterday said this was a 'ludicrous price'. Bechstein is not in
a position to argue. Neither are the altruists in the senate in a position
to offer DM150m, particularly since Berlin is running an annual deficit of
over DM7bn.
The senate could rescue Bechstein by paying out DM40m and reap profits at a
later date. Or it could let Bechstein sell the property on the open market.
