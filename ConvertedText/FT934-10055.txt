FT  08 NOV 93 / Nadir threat to sue law officers


MR ASIL NADIR, the fugitive tycoon, said yesterday that he would start
litigation against the police and political figures over accusations that he
was involved in a conspiracy to bribe a judge.
Mr Nadir, former chairman of Polly Peck, who fled to Turkish-controlled
northern Cyprus in May to escape Pounds 30m fraud charges, spoke after two
witnesses at the centre of the alleged plot had arrived in the island.
Mr Ali Riza Gorgon, Mr Nadir's lawyer, has declined to disclose where they
are staying, but has said a news conference is planned in the northern
Cyprus town of Kyrenia.
Mr Nadir has rejected allegations of conspiracy to bribe Sir Richard Tucker,
the judge who was to hear the case against him. He said on BBC Television
that he had met the two witnesses - Mr Michael Francis and Ms Wendy Welsher
 -and that their appearance on the scene 'makes life that much more simple
now'.
Mr Nadir said: 'It is my intention in the not too distant future - and I am
talking about a matter of weeks now - to litigate against all the people who
have taken part in this conspiracy.'
This involved numerous organisations: 'Certainly the Serious Fraud Office,
certainly Scotland Yard - and I am talking about the fifth floor (where the
top officers work) - the director of public prosecutions, the
attorney-general, and wherever the responsibility lies; and very likely it
will have to be the Home Office and the home secretary.'
Scotland Yard has described suggestions that officers conspired to fabricate
evidence against Nadir as 'nonsense'.
