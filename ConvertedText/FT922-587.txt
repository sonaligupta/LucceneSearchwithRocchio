FT  26 JUN 92 / Rivers watchdog looks to costs


THE National Rivers Authority intends to recover more of its costs from
those who benefit directly from its work and to reduce its dependence on
government grants, according to its latest corporate plan, published
yesterday.
The plan from the rivers watchdog sets out key priorities for protecting and
improving the water environment in England and Wales up to 1996.
