FT  13 APR 94 / Finance minister warns on recovery


   By WILLIAM DAWKINS


Mr Hirohisa Fujii, Japan's finance minister, yesterday warned that the
country's recession had not bottomed out, challenging the mild optimism
shown recently by the central bank and many private-sector economists.
The current political upheavals might dampen public confidence at a
'delicate stage' in the economic cycle, said Mr Fujii, commenting on the
latest monthly report by the government's Economic Planning Agency.
Personal spending showed a slight recovery last month, and housing starts
continued to climb, according to the EPA's report. However, industrial
production, representing nearly a third of Japan's gross domestic product,
was 'lacklustre' despite progress in reducing stocks of unsold goods. Output
has been falling for nearly 2 1/2 years. Company earnings, in their fourth
year of decline, remain weak, said the agency.
Ms Manae Kubota, EPA director general, was slightly less gloomy about her
agency's report than Mr Fujii. 'If there is not a big stumble, the economy
is headed in a good direction,' she said, citing as one risk a delay in
public works investment caused by the present political chaos.
This contrasts with the view of Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of
Japan, and shared by many private sector economists, that the recession is
near the trough and that the conditions for recovery are in place. The
consensus forecast is for a very gentle upturn, to 0.3 per cent growth in
gross domestic product this year, after last year's 0.1 per cent rise in
GDP.
Capital investment by industry continues to fall, suggest the latest weak
orders for machinery. The private sector spent 8.9 per cent less on
industrial machinery in February than the same month in the previous year,
and 7.3 per cent down from January.
