FT  30 JUN 93 / Letter: Potentially painful position


   From Mr WALTER GREY


Sir, The new chancellor, in his FT interview ('A rounded bloke at the
Treasury', June 25), declared his to be 'essentially a political post', but
did not feel disqualified from handling monetary policy, which is
essentially technical - like the administration of justice - and must be
non-political to achieve the best results.
Small wonder, in the debate over an independent Bank of England left to
conduct monetary policy free from political interference, Clarke
acknowledged himself to be 'sitting on the fence' - an uncomfortable
position, nevertheless, if maintained for any length of time.
