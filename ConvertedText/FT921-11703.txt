IRAN yesterday denied reports alleging it was recruiting scientists from the
former Soviet Union for a covert nuclear weapons programme, Tehran radio
reported, AP-DJ reports.
The broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman as
saying the reports were 'totally baseless'.
British newspaper reports suggested at the weekend that Iran was offering
Dollars 360,000 (Pounds 200,000) to former Soviet nuclear scientists to
develop an alleged nuclear arms programme. Earlier reports alleged the
Iranians had bought nuclear bombs from the newly-independent republics. Iran
denied those allegations.
The Iranian spokesman stressed that Iran was a signatory to the
Non-Proliferation Treaty, and that it was 'also one of the most active
non-aligned countries concerning proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction'.
Iran has two nuclear power plants, a small research reactor bought from the
US before the revolution installed at Tehran University and a second
research reactor recently bought from China. The country is believed to be
about a decade away in being able to build an atomic weapon.
Iran's non-oil exports more than doubled in the last nine months of 1991,
the Iranian news agency IRNA reported yesterday, Reuter reports from
Nicosia. The agency, quoting Mr Abdolhossein Vahhaji, the commerce minister,
said exports rose 110 per cent to Dollars 1.85bn (Pounds 1bn) in the
nine-months to December 21.
