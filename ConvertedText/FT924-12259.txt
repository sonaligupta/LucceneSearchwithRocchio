FT  21 OCT 92 / International Company News: Smith Corona posts Dollars 5.1m
shortfall

   NEW YORK


SMITH Corona, the US manufacturer of portable typewriters which is 48 per
cent owned by Britain's Hanson group, yesterday disclosed that it made a
Dollars 5.1m loss after tax in the three months to end-September.
The loss was scored on sales of Dollars 81.2m - slightly below the Dollars
87.2m seen in the same period of 1991 - and compares with a Dollars 4.1m
after-tax profit in the third quarter a year ago. The loss is, however,
struck after Dollars 9m of restructuring costs; these did not feature a year
ago.
Smith Corona put the blame on the general weakness in consumer spending. It
said that personal word processor unit sales in the US increased
'substantially' - partly because shipping problems depressed the figure last
year - but that overall domestic unit sales declined.
