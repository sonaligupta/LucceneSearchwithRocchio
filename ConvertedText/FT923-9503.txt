FT  05 AUG 92 / BR sell-off 'ill thought out' say Lib Dems


   By DAVID OWEN


GOVERNMENT plans for privatising British Rail were 'extremely ill thought
out' and risked destroying the rail system, Mr Alan Beith, Liberal Democrat
Treasury spokesman, said yesterday.
Mr Beith was unveiling a Liberal Democrat policy paper on competition in the
utilities sector.
The document, to be debated at the party's annual conference next month,
covers policies for the energy, transport, communications and water
industries.
Mr Beith said common thread of the document was that competition rather than
ownership was the main utilities-related issue. 'Privatisation has not by
itself solved all the problems of the utilities or created a competitive
environment,' he said.
The party's proposals include:
Restructuring the electricity generating companies into smaller units.
Divesting British Gas of its pipelines and providing equal access to the
network for all operators.
Opening up the coal industry to new entrants.
Separating British Telecommunication's trunk and international business from
its regional and local networks.
Extending the competitive tendering of bus services.
Creating a rail holding company to franchise services and stations.
Where a monopoly existed, it should be broken up or regulated 'very
strictly' in the consumer's interest, Mr Beith said.
