FT  27 APR 94 / Survey of Hong Kong (17): Growth path may not be so smooth -
The stock market


   By LOUISE LUCAS


The Hong Kong stock market, like Topsy, has growed and growed.
In the first quarter of this year 19 new companies were listed, including
Yizheng Chemical Fibre, the mainland polyester fibre maker which notched up
the third biggest share issue in the colony. These companies together raised
a total of HKDollars 4.5bn.
Today, with a capitalisation of HKDollars 2.33 trillion, the Hong Kong stock
market ranks as the world's seventh largest, just behind Canada and ahead of
Switzerland. The market has not only grown in dollars, it has developed in
terms of stature as well, underscoring its aim to secure international
recognition.
Over the past 18 months, listing rules have been overhauled to the benefit
of minority shareholders; clearing and settlement now take place on a
continuous net basis; automated order matching and execution is in place;
regulated short-selling has been given the green light; and a framework
paving the way for mainland China enterprises to be listed on the Hong Kong
stock exchange is on the statute book.
Starting with Tsingtao Brewery, China's best-known beer, seven state-owned
enterprises are now partially in the hands of Hong Kong and overseas
investors. Two more will follow in the next two months and a further 22 have
been selected for an overseas listing, all bar four of which are destined
for the Hong Kong market.
Clearly for the stock exchange - like vast majority of the companies it
regulates - China will continue to be the major focus of expansion. However,
as demonstrated by last month's release of its blueprint for development
over the years up to and through 1997, the exchange is maintaining a tight
grip on the domestic running of financial markets. On the agenda are a
greater reliance on self-vetting and disclosure, which will be improved to
meet the new demands incumbent upon it, and the development of a more active
debt market.
Equity issues made up 89 per cent of last year's turnover on the stock
market, with warrants accounting for the remainder: debt played a negligible
role. Of the USDollars 4bn of convertible securities issued in 1993, only
three were listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange. 'Initiatives to
facilitate the listing and trading of more debt issues would appear to be a
top priority for the exchange,' says its March consultative paper, The Way
Forward.
A subsequent paper proposes putting greater information in the hands of
shareholders - not least directors' salaries and perks, and an end to the
practice of allowing banks to ferret away 'hidden' reserves - which will
serve to bring standards of disclosure more firmly in line with those in the
UK and elsewhere.
However, the exponential growth path mapped out in the boardrooms of the
stock exchange is unlikely to proceed as smoothly as it looks on paper.
Firstly, the volatility which has ripped into markets across the world has
triggered each-way daily swings of 3 or 4 per cent on the Hang Seng Index;
global securities houses have hacked back their Hong Kong weightings; and
the anticipated easing of property prices will rebound badly on the stock
market, reflecting companies' heavy exposure to property.
Last year, the Hang Seng Index rose 115 per cent on a tide of overseas cash
and strong corporate earnings. Securities houses vied with each other for
the most hyperbolic buy signals - culminating with Mr Barton Biggs, Morgan
Stanley's director of global strategy, who fell back on the words of LSD
guru Dr Timothy Leary to describe his elation: 'After eight days in China,
I'm tuned in, over-fed and maximum bullish' - and a new issue was deemed a
failure if it did not attract a hefty oversubscription.
The market capitalisation at the end of 1993 was, at 347 per cent of GDP,
the highest in the region. Daily turnover last year averaged HKDollars
4.9bn, up 70 per cent on the previous year, and reached a record HKDollars
17.2bn on January 7 of this year.
In 1994, however, liquidity and over-bullish statements have been more
notable by their absence. Initial public offerings, for their part, have
often performed poorly on their debut after modest take-ups. Performance for
the year to date has seen Hong Kong languish at the bottom of world league
tables, although latterly a tentative trickle of Japanese buying has helped
recoup some of the losses.
Secondly, investors are again focusing on the political and economic risks
attached to Hong Kong: power struggles, a potential hard landing for the
economy and poor trade relations in China all undermine Hong Kong ratings.
The China risk weighting on Hong Kong, especially as the sell-by date looms,
is unlikely to endear new candidates. Already two long-standing old hands -
Jardine Matheson and Jardine Strategic - have said they will quit the
exchange at the end of this year, thus extricating themselves from post-1997
jurisdiction under the Special Administrative Region government.
Thirdly, a small but growing band of market practitioners is unhappy at the
direction the stock exchange is taking. They regard its stance on regulatory
issues as over-zealous, and believe that on other proposals - such as the
introduction of a second board, a notion which has been quashed by the
exchange - it lacks flexibility.
These are not criticisms that stock exchange directors are likely to lose
sleep over - indeed, given the exchange's history, replete with corruption,
scandals and a jailed former chairman, such attacks must seem like praise -
but they show that the exchange will be unable to implement each and every
proposal in its latest blueprint for reform without a fight.
The exchange also faces a powerful adversary when it proposes doing away
with stamp duty, which now stands at 0.15 per cent to both the buyer and the
seller. This is a strong source of revenue for the government, but the
exchange - and members - argue that removing the duty would facilitate
technical and short-term trading strategies, so enhancing liquidity.
