FT  23 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: US alert boosts Tiphook


   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY


COMMENTS from the US that shares in container rental group Tiphook were
undervalued, making the company a possible bid target, inspired hectic
dealing in the stock on both sides of the Atlantic and sent the share price
sharply higher.
Takeover talk started after a US fund manager suggested on a television
programme that the recent slide in the comp-any's shares could lead to a bid
at a minimum of Dollars 20. This started strong trading in Tiphook's
American Depositary Receipts in New York.
In London the shares jumped 50 to 247p at one stage in active trading as
speculation of a bid mounted, forcing the company to issue a statement that
it was not in takeover talks, nor in financial difficulties. It said it
would pay its year-end dividend as announced earlier this month.
Shares in Tiphook had fallen sharply from around the 344p level just ahead
of its results on July 14, and weakened further following its report of a
loss after changes in accountancy practice. The company had aleady issued a
profits warning in April which prompted a heavy setback in the shares.
Analysts in London expressed doubt that a bid was in the offing but believe
the net asset value of the company to be around Pounds 4 a share. Mr Ian
Wilde at BZW said the current share price remains 'a poor reflection of the
long term value of the company'.
Profit-taking saw the shares come off the top yesterday to finish 47 up at
244p after strong trade of 2.5m.
However, doubts remain in some quarters about the long-term strength of the
share price, given recent worries about its trading performance.
