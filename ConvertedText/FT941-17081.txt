FT  06 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: 'Good year' for pension funds may
have been relatively poor


   From Mr GORDON CLARK


Sir, I find your article, 'Good year for occupational pension funds'
(January 4) - regarding the 'impressive' performance of UK pension funds in
1993 - somewhat misleading.
On the basis used by many actuaries to value the assets of an ongoing
pension fund, pension scheme assets actually fell by about 1 per cent in
1993. The reasons: the changes in ACT in the April Budget effectively acted
as a tax on schemes' future income, and corporate dividend growth was
sluggish to say the least.
Those who would seek to accuse the actuaries of living in an ivory tower
would do well to consider the number of articles appearing in your paper
which attempt to rationalise the current levels of equity markets - shades
of 1987 perhaps? Those who would dismiss the actuaries' views out of hand
can always fall back on market values. On this basis the investment return
was indeed 27.8 per cent. However, the market value of the liabilities of
the typical scheme will have increased during 1993 by some 25 per cent due
to the fall in long-term interest rates. Both figures need to be considered
together.
There is a serious point to be made here. Namely the widespread
misconception that short-term market movements have an immediate impact on
the long-term finances of pension funds.
It is important that the long-term nature of corporate pension provision is
more widely understood. Rather than a good year for occupational funds, 1993
may prove to have been a relatively poor one, with the result that more
companies will have to end their contribution holidays or increase their
level of contributions, thus continuing a process widely publicised in your
paper in 1993.
