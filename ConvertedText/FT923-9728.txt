FT  04 AUG 92 / Tudjman tightens grip with poll win in Croatia

   ZAGREB, LONDON


PRESIDENT Franjo Tudjman of Croatia has won 55 per cent of the votes in the
country's first presidential election since gaining independence from
Yugoslavia.
In the concurrent parliamentary poll on Sunday, his ruling Croatian
Democratic Union party (HDZ) looked set to gain a majority in the 124-seat
parliament after winning 41 per cent of the votes.
Mr Tudjman's critics said the result cast a shadow over the development of
democracy in Croatia. Mr Zarko Puhovski, a professor of political philosophy
at Zagreb University, said he was concerned the vote would be seen as a
mandate for Mr Tudjman and HDZ to rule single-handedly.
'If they have been elected in both presidential and parliamentary elections,
then they will understand the results as the legitimisation of their
authoritarian rule,' said Mr Puhovski. 'This is the worst possible outcome
in terms of democracy. Tudjman has ruled from some kind of court for years.'
The vote for Mr Tudjman and the HDZ also appears unlikely to bring Croatia
closer to a resolution of the Serbian question. Ethnic Serbs, who make up 12
per cent of the 4.5m population, generally abstained from voting - with the
exception of urban Serbs. The 200,000 Serbs living in the UN-patrolled zones
and 200,000 Serbs who fled the war to Serbia did not vote.
Mr Tudjman's victory is likely to radicalise Croatia's rural Serbs, who
waged a nationalist war against independence after the HDZ came to power in
1990. About 10,000 people were killed and towns destroyed in the war. David
Owen reports from London: Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, ruled out
any immediate prospect of a militarily imposed solution in the former
Yugoslavia, saying the international community could not be united behind
such a policy.
