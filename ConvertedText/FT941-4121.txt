FT  12 MAR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Spices


The pepper market was less active this week but the undertone of most black
and white pepper grades remained fully steady, reports Man Producten. White
muntok was traded at about USDollars 2,875 a tonne, cif, for March/April
shipment and at Dollars 2,750 for July/August. Grinders' buying interested
was mainly for the later shipment positions. There was good activity in in
the lower priced qualities of black pepper Dollars 1,500 and Dollars 1,600 a
tonne, cif. The main source of supply at the moment is Vietnam, but this
will not last very long. In 'asta' grades activity was very slack and in the
absence of support from US Buyers prices came down by about Dollars 100 a
tonne to stabilise at about Dollars 1,750-Dollars 1,800, cif.
