FT  28 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Gephardt raises hurdle for Nafta


   By NANCY DUNNE


   WASHINGTON


THE planned North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) faced a new hurdle
yesterday as the majority leader in the US House of Representatives demanded
that negotiators write in strong protection for the environment and US jobs.
The call by Mr Richard Gephardt came after ministers from Canada, Mexico and
the US made progress on a number of fronts in weekend negotiations in Mexico
City. They appeared close to completing a final draft text.
Mr Gephardt's demands threatened to scupper one of the few vote-winning
initiatives left to President George Bush who, in opinion polls, is trailing
Mr Bill Clinton, his Democratic rival in November's presidential election.
Mr Gephardt said Nafta negotiators 'can and must do better'. The pact could
become an 'engine of growth' but only if 'properly drafted'.
He said it should include:
A joint US-Mexico border commission to promote health and environment, offer
bonds, inspect facilities and enforce laws;
A cross-border transaction tax to raise funds for worker training,
infrastructure development and environmental protection;
Provisions to make failure to abide by environmental laws an unfair trade
practice and to allow US shareholders to sue companies doing business in
Mexico if they fail to abide by Mexican laws;
Creation of an industry Code of Conduct for the maquiladora industries on
the Mexican border.
Congress last year voted to give the Bush administration so-called
'fast-track' negotiating authority for Nafta. This means the pact cannot be
amended as it makes its way through the House and Senate. But Mr Gephardt
said the changes he wanted could be written into the implementation
legislation.
Defending Nafta, Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, said the pact
would 'meet or beat' every commitment Mr Bush made on environment and labour
goals.
