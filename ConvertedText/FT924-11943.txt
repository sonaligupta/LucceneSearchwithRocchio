FT  23 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Brent Walker sells phoneline arm


   By MAGGIE URRY


BRENT WALKER has sold Interactive Media Services, its telephone information
business, to a management buy-out for Pounds 12.7m.
IMS operates the Rapid Raceline, Rapid Cricketline and Rapid Golfline
services which give callers to an 0891 telephone number up-to-date
information on those sports.
Brent Walker, the betting, pubs and property group trying to reduce its
heavy debts through asset sales, has received Pounds 10.7m cash and is
lending the buy-out the other Pounds 2m, at a 5 per cent interest rate. This
will rank below the mbo's Pounds 4m of senior debt, and will be repaid after
the senior debt has been repaid, probably by October 1996.
Mr John Brown, a director of Brent Walker and head of its William Hill
betting chain, and his deputy Mr Robert Lambert, will receive up to Pounds
1.7m of the proceeds of the sale. They had an equity interest in the
telephone business dating back to an agreement they made with Mr George
Walker, former chairman and chief executive of Brent Walker, in September
1989 when the company bought William Hill.
The other Pounds 11m of the sale proceeds will be retained by Brent Walker.
The buy-out is led by Mr Bill Wilson, managing director of the company. It
has Pounds 7m of equity backing from 3i, Murray Johnstone and County NatWest
Ventures.
The purchase price compares with net assets of Pounds 1.5m at December 31
1991, and net profits last year of Pounds 2.45m.
