FT  01 DEC 94 / Observer: Naked Ken


Meanwhile, the prize for the most imaginative piece of post-Budget
scribbling must go to Credit Lyonnais Laing for its 26-page glossy booklet -
Kenneth: his new Budget. No one has tried harder to sell a boring Budget to
a wider audience. Starting with a flattering portrait of the chancellor, the
dust cover promises that Kenneth reveals all: how his spending disorder was
found out; how the markets forced him into a loveless marriage with Eddie;
how his private conversations were later revealed in the press, etc.
Plaudits for the book include: 'It's hard to believe it's all his own work'
(Norman Lamont), to 'Right up to the last page you don't know how much tax
you are going to be paying' (Crime Writers' Guild). However, Labour's Gordon
Brown summed it up best - 'A difficult one to follow.'
