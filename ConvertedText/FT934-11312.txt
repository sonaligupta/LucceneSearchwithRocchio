FT  02 NOV 93 / Tide of ethnic Germans recedes


   By JUDY DEMPSEY and REUTER


   BERLIN


THE number of ethnic Germans seeking to live in Germany has fallen sharply
in the past 10 months, with the former Soviet Union accounting for the
greatest reduction, the Interior Ministry announced yesterday.
Mr Horst Waffenschmidt, state secretary, said 187,658 ethnic Germans, or
Aussiedlers, from the former Soviet Union, had applied to move to Germany,
nearly 100,000 fewer than in the same period last year. More than 158,815,
particularly from the Omsk and Volga regions, and Saint Petersburg, have
arrived in the country since January.
Applicants from eastern Europe are also falling, partly because the ethnic
German community has dwindled over the past 10 years, but also possibly
because of the economic climate and growing unemployment in Germany. The
number of ethnic Germans from Poland fell to 9,100 from 25,045, and from
Romania to 5,643 from 12,922. In all, 168,653 ethnic Germans have settled in
Germany since January.
The German authorities have tried to restrict the number of ethnic Germans,
who have an automatic right to citizenship, by promoting German-language
schools, newspapers and cultural centres where they live. But Mr
Waffenschmidt said yesterday they would only remain in their region if they
had incentive to do so.
German prosecutors yesterday began investigating an assault by right-wing
extremists on US athletes at the weekend, Reuter reports from Berlin.
Authorities in Oberhof said about 15 skinheads shouted racist insults at two
US athletes, both of whom were black. A team-mate who came to their aid was
beaten.
