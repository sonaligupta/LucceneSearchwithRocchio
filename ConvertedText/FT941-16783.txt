FT  07 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: TV stocks active


   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and CLARE GASCOIGNE


Media stocks were generally buoyant, with interest continuing on hopes that
the government review of the television sector would be sooner rather than
later.
But one casualty was Yorkshire-Tyne Tees TV, off 15 at 177p, after the
collapse of merger talks with LWT. An analyst said the difficulty of
divesting Tyne Tees could deter bids from other television companies.
The failure of the talks led one analyst to describe the hostile Pounds 670m
takeover of LWT by Granada as 'a fraction less than a foregone conclusion'.
LWT was up 22 at 648p and Granada added 14 at 553p.
Also affected was Anglia, as prospects of a bid for Tyne Tees receded and
rumours of a takeover by MAI, which controls Meridian, the south of England
franchise holder, revived. However, analysts said that Anglia was an
attractive proposition, and MAI may not be the only interested party; Anglia
shares were up 14 at 455p.
The firmer crude oil price led to strong buying activity for oil stocks.
Enterprise Oil put on 17 at 462p, with a Smith New Court recommendation said
to have also played a part in the day's advance.
Turnover in British Petroleum rose to 10m as the stock climbed 16 to 371p,
and Shell Transport was also heavily dealt, with volume reaching 4.4m as the
shares jumped 22 to 741p.
The sharp overnight retreat in the Hang Seng Index took its toll of several
Hong Kong related stocks. The day's casualties included banking group HSBC,
which relinquished 60 to 905p in trade of 6.8m shares, Cable and Wireless,
18 lighter at 504p, and Inchcape, which shed 3 to 551p.
Food retailers and manufacturers enjoyed a buoyant session as dealers
reported some switching out of the retailers and into two of the worst
performing market sectors of 1993.
Gains were made across the board. Among manufacturers, Cadbury-Schweppes
added 16 at 534p, Unigate 19 at 392p, Northern Foods 11 at 251p, United
Biscuits 13 at 372p, Dalgety 18 at 510p and Hillsdown 11 at 178p. Turnover
in supermarket operator Asda hit 49m as the shares firmed 1 3/4 to 62p. J.
Sainsbury climbed 13 to 461p, Tesco 9 1/2 to 231 1/2 p and Kwik Save 11 to
617p.
Lesiure stocks were also firm as investors sought recovery plays. Thorn EMI
was again a prominent feature as the shares followed Wednesday's rise of 21
with an advance of 33 to 1044p. Rank Organisation jumped 17 to 1031p, while
Compass Group put on 13 at 692p. News of record overseas holiday bookings
sent the tour operators forward, Airtours gaining 4 at 496p and Owners
Abroad 7 at 88p.
TSB remained in demand ahead of next week's results. The shares rose 6 to
247p.
Among composite insurers, a shortage of stock in Sun Alliance was credited
with the day's advance in the shares. They added 19 at 411p. General buying
in the sector saw Commercial Union finish 14 ahead at 661p. SG Warburg is
said to be positive on the stock.
In the insurance brokers, Willis Corroon stood out with an advance of 11 to
240p, boosted by a recommendation from Kleinwort Benson.
A broker's tip earlier this week continued to boost both TI Group and GKN.
Shares in the former appreciated 20 to finish at 431p, while the latter
moved ahead 13 to 560 1/2 p.
Henderson Crosthwaite was again a heavy buyer of Rolls-Royce shares, which
firmed 3 to 171p in strong volume of 8m.
Engineering group Siebe failed to capitalise on a positive presentation at
Kleinwort Benson as large lines of stock remained on offer. The shares
retreated 11 to 561p.
There was further profit-taking in the water sector. Hardest hit were
Anglian, down 20 at 549p. North West and Thames each declined 10 to 550p and
559p respectively, Southern lost 9 to 639p and Severn Trent dipped 8 to
583p. Mr Peter Hyde at Kleinwort Benson forecast continuing volatility until
the regulatory review in July. But for the longer term he remained
optimistic, with the prospect of outperformance towards the end of the year.
Among transport stocks, British Airways' December passenger figures, up 9
per cent, lifted the shares 7 to 464p.
Strong buying of Reuters from agency broker Henderson Crosthwaite sent the
shares sharply forward by 38 to 1823p in good volume of 2.3m. Analysts were
dismissive of bid rumours involving Reed International, down 10 at 894p.
Rackwood Mineral Holdings made an impressive debut. The shares closed 6
above the placing price at 46p.
