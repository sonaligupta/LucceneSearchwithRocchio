FT  22 OCT 94 / International Company News: Volkswagen confirms ousting of
director


   By ANDREW FISHER


   FRANKFURT


The ousting of Mr Werner Schmidt as Volkswagen's finance director was
confirmed yesterday by the German car company, though it gave no reason for
the widely expected decision which has been linked to heavy losses at VW's
Seat subsidiary in Spain.
After a meeting of its supervisory board, the non-executive board which
decides top management appointments, VW said Mr Schmidt, 62, would step down
at the end of the year. He would continue to advise the company on a
consultancy basis. VW officials said Mr Schmidt was not going because of the
Seat problems, though they gave no other reason.
Last year, Seat nearly collapsed, making an unexpected loss of DM1.8bn
(Dollars 1.2bn). Seat's chairman, Mr Juan Antonio Diaz Alvarez, was sacked
last autumn; the rest of the top management has since been replaced. Mr
Schmidt was head of Seat's supervisory board for five years up to mid-1991.
He has again been on this board since June, 1993.
Mr Schmidt, with the group for 27 years (including 19 on the board), was not
one of chairman Mr Ferdinand Piech's close associates. Relations have been
cool since Mr Piech became head of the group at the start of 1993. His
determination to remove Mr Schmidt - whose career has included spells as
head of exports, chairman of VW in Brazil and head of Audi, the executive
car subsidiary - may have been reinforced by an auditor's report by the
Arthur Andersen accountancy concern on how the Seat losses occurred.
VW said yesterday it intended to implement recommendations by Andersen to
tighten up its financial controls. Following Mr Schmidt's departure, Mr
Bruno Adelt will become board member for financial controlling and
accounting and Mr Jens Neumann, the director responsible for group strategy
will add the group treasury function to his activities.
