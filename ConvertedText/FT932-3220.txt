FT  15 JUN 93 / International Company News: Investors sue Merrill


   By PATRICK HARVERSON


A GROUP of foreign investors is suing Merrill Lynch for more than Dollars
86m. They allege they were misled over the riskiness of an international
mutual fund sold by the big US securities house.
The suit, filed in a San Diego court by individual investors and investment
companies from Mexico, Liberia, Israel and the British West Indies, revolves
around two of Merrill's mutual funds - the Short-Term World Income Portfolio
and the Short-Term Global Income Fund - which invest in a variety of
short-term foreign debt securities.
According to the suit, the two funds were broadly similar, yet the foreign
investors in the World fund were not adequately informed in the prospectus
of the risks, while the US investors in the Global fund were told of the
riskiness of their fund's investments.
Merrill Lynch emphatically refuted the allegations. In a statement, the firm
said: 'There were no misrepresentations to World fund investors and there is
absolutely no merit to this lawsuit.'
