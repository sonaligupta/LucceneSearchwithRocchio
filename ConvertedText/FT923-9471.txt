FT  05 AUG 92 / UK Company News: 18% growth for Admiral


   By ALAN CANE


ADMIRAL, a Camberley-based computing services company, made sound progress
in the first half of 1992 despite tough trading conditions.
Pre-tax profits were 18 per cent ahead at Pounds 1.96m while turnover
advanced 17 per cent to Pounds 13.66m.
Earnings per share rose to 11.6p (10.3p) and the interim dividend has been
set at 1.7p, a 13 per cent advance on last year's 1.5p.
The results included a contribution from Computer Business Consultants,
which Admiral acquired recently, but Mr Clay Brendish, chairman, said the
results represented essentially organic growth.
He said that Admiral had continued to prosper while many other computing
services companies were showing reduced revenues and profits because of
strong project and business management.
The company specialises in the defence, government and financial services
sectors but its commercial and industrial divisions were developing well, Mr
Brendish said.
