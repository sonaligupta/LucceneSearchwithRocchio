FT  21 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Building materials


This week's announcement that Blue Circle is closing or mothballing 15 per
cent of its UK cement capacity is depressing news for investors in the UK
building materials sector. It is the most striking admission to date that
cost cutting alone is not enough. Output remains excessive given the low
levels of demand expected by the industry for another couple of years.
Blue Circle, at least, has a sufficiently robust balance sheet to be able to
absorb an 8 per cent hit to shareholders' funds (including the planned
property write down also revealed on Thursday). The cement market, moreover,
is concentrated into just three big players, which not only makes capacity
cuts easier to manage but helps maintain price discipline and thus the
chance of an early payback. Elsewhere, things are less happy. Redland is
playing a longer game but so far its efforts to cut brick capacity in the
wake of the Steetley takeover have had little effect on prices.
In aggregates Tarmac is making some cuts, but progress towards a better
balance is hindered by the fragmented nature of the market and companies'
need to run for cash. With construction output expected to be down 5 per
cent in 1993 - on top of this year's likely 10 per cent - it is hard to be
enthusiastic about any shares in this sector.
