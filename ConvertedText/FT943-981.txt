FT  27 SEP 94 / MTV to establish HQ in London


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


MTV Networks, the US-owned music television group, is to make London its
international headquarters for all activities outside the US.
Mr Bill Roedy, chief executive of MTV Europe, will become president of MTV
Networks International, in charge of everything from MTV Latino, the Latin
American service, to the launch of two channels in Asia by the end of the
year.
He will continue to be based in London at the headquarters of MTV Europe
although he will also have an office in New York.
London has been given increased importance as an MTV centre because MTV
Europe, with music, news and features adapted for the European market, is
becoming bigger than the US operation.
MTV Europe has been profitable for two years although it declines to give
figures. It is available in more than 60m homes in 37 countries compared
with 59m for the US version, and in the past year has extended its reach to
Greece, the former Soviet Union, Lebanon and Turkey.
MTV, which is owned by Viacom, claims it is the biggest television network
in the world, reaching 250m homes in 63 countries.
On Friday MTV Networks launches a new UK satellite channel - VH-1 UK, a
music channel aimed at people aged 25 to 49.
Mr Roedy is studying the feasibility of a VH-1 channel for Germany and
planning two MTV Asian channels by the end of the year. MTV went off Mr
Rupert Murdoch's Star TV satellite system in April after the two sides
failed to agree.
The company is planning a scrambled Mandarin-language service aimed at
China, Taiwan and Singapore and an English language service with some Hindi
programming for India and south-east Asia.
