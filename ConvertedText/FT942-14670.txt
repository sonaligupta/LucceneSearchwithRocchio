FT  19 APR 94 / International Company News: Spanish bank backs Kemper in bid
fight


   By RICHARD WATERS


   NEW YORK


Banco Santander, the Spanish bank and one of the largest shareholders in
Kemper, yesterday sided with the US financial group's management in its
fight to ward off a Dollars 2.2bn approach from GE Capital.
However, comments made by Mr Emilio Botin, chairman of the bank, suggested
it may be prepared to accept a higher offer.
Mr Botin praised Kemper's management, led by Mr David Mathis, for
transforming the firm into 'a dynamic financial services company with
considerable upside potential'.
In an apparent indication that the bank might be prepared to sell at a
higher price, he said shareholders should back the current management
'rather than be acquired at a price which does not recognise its (Kemper's)
true value'.
GE Capital's bid to win control of Kemper has so far failed to flush out any
rival bidders for the company.
