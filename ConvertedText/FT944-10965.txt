There was a strong general demand, reports the Tea Brokers' Association.
Landed good liquoring Assams met keen competition and were generally 10 to
20p dearer but plainer sorts were barely steady. Bright and medium east
Africans were well supported at fully firm to dearer rates. Ceylons were
about steady. Offshore: good demand at fully firm rates. Quotations: best
available 185p/kg, good 144p/kg, good medium 124p/kg, medium 114p/kg, low
medium 90p/kg. The highest price realised this week was 189p/kg for an Assam
