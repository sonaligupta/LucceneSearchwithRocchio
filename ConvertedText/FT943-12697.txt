FT  23 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Sensibilities blunted by years of
welfare


   From Mr DOMINIC HOBSON


Regular readers of Joe Rogaly's column do not doubt that he is fired with
the anger of the disinherited. He is right to remind us of the deterioration
in the material conditions of the poor since 1979.
But in arguing that 'The Tory right cannot easily persuade us that kindness,
the essence of charity, figures in its calculations', he perpetuates the
commonest fallacy of collectivist thinking.
The willingness of politicians to advocate the redistribution of the income
and wealth of others, and of their supporters to vote for it, is not moral,
nor kind, nor altruistic, nor charitable.
It is merely the coercion and expropriation of one sect-ion of the
population by an-other.
'We can never have regard to the virtue of an action,' as David Hume reminds
us in A Treatise of Human Nature, 'unless the action be antecedently
virtuous. No action can be virtuous, but so far as it proceeds from a
virtuous motive.'
In social welfare, the authentic moral choices are those which men and women
make with their own time and money and not those which they are compelled to
make by the state.
The virtuous do not merely abide by the law but exercise their moral
faculties and personal judgment.
Unfortunately, the state now takes such a large proportion of personal
incomes, and monopolises so many aspects of welfare, that both the
opportunity and the means of making personal moral choices have quite
shrivelled up.
It is 50 years of the welfare state, not 15 years of Thatcherism, which has
blunted our sensibilities.
