FT  24 NOV 92 / Dividend warning as BET falls 43%


   By RICHARD GOURLAY


BET, the business services company, yesterday reported a 43 per cent drop in
profits and predicted the recession, which has savaged operating margins,
would continue for two more years.
'We are an early indicator (of recovery),' said Mr John Clark, chief
executive. 'If we ain't seeing it, then it ain't coming.' BET shares fell
from 112 1/2 p to 92p.
The company, which last July launched a Pounds 200m rights issue, also left
open the possibility that it will cut the second-half dividend. The 'current
intention' was to maintain a full-year dividend of 6.5p, Mr Clark said. This
was unlikely to be covered by earnings. Next year's dividend, which many
City analysts believe is also unlikely to be covered, would be 'considered
very carefully', the company said.
At the interim stage, pre-tax profits to September fell from Pounds 71.5m to
Pounds 40.5m on sales 4 per cent lower at Pounds 1.18bn. Earnings per share
fell from 5.6p to 1.7p and the interim dividend is to be cut from 4.25p to
2p.
The results revealed a collapse in operating profits from Pounds 93m to
Pounds 49.7m on sales from ongoing businesses of Pounds 1.13bn. This
included Pounds 11m of exceptional costs mainly covering reorganisation of
businesses for sale and the UK textile services business.
The company also revealed that it has run into an ACT problem. Its reliance
on the UK, where profits were hardest hit, meant the group was not liable
for enough mainstream corporation tax against which it could offset its ACT.
As a result, BET wrote off Pounds 8m of ACT in the first half. The group's
tax charge is likely to rise to 45 per cent this year, from 26 per cent.
Mr Clark said the new management team has also decided to sell more
businesses. The cash raised would be used to 'improve BET's mix of
businesses'.
Net debt fell from 107m to Pounds 91m - or Pounds 49m including the
proceeds of the sale of Initial USA. As a result, the interest charge fell
from Pounds 22m to Pounds 9m.
The company used the proceeds of its rights issue to repay Dollars 380m
(Pounds 251m) of auction market preferred stock and confirmed that, while it
was unconcerned by the level of this form of financing, it would be repaying
the Dollars 120m balance 'at an appropriate time' from its own resources.
