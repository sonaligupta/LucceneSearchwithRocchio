FT  19 APR 91 / International Company News: Lockheed hit by higher tax bill


   By BERNARD SIMON


LOCKHEED, the US aerospace group, blamed sharply higher tax provisions for a
22 per cent drop in first-quarter earnings.
Net income dropped to Dollars 54m, or 85 cents a share, from Dollars 69m, or
Dollars 1.09, a year ago. Sales were virtually unchanged at Dollars 2.2bn,
but income tax provisions jumped by 53 per cent, to Dollars 29m.
The company ascribed the rise in its tax rate, from 21 to 35 per cent, to
payments becoming due on taxes deferred on contracts begun as long ago as
1985-86 but now completed.
Mr Daniel Tellep, chairman, described first-quarter operations as 'very
solid,' and predicted strong growth in operating profits this year.
Margins improved on missiles, space equipment, defence electronics and
aeronautical systems. On the other hand, the recession pushed down profits
from peripherals for commercial computers, while start-up expenses depressed
earnings from its aerospace services division.
Lockheed boosted its quarterly dividend last month to 50 cents from 45 cents
after Dallas-based investor Harold Simmons agreed to end his bid for control
of the company after an unsuccessful proxy fight.
