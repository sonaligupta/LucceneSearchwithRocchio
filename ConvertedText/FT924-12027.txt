FT  22 OCT 92 / International Company News: Cominco back in the black


   By BERNARD SIMON

COMINCO, the Canadian base metals and fertiliser producer, returned to the
black in the third quarter, thanks to higher zinc and copper prices and
improved costs at its smelter at Trail, British Columbia.
But a company official noted the slump in zinc and nickel prices since
end-September was likely to hit fourth-quarter earnings. But lower prices in
the current quarter may be partially offset by higher sales of concentrate
from the Red Dog and Polaris mines.
Third-quarter earnings were CDollars 10.1m (USDollars 8.1m), or 12 cents a
share, before extraordinary items, compared with a loss of CDollars 23.2 ,
or 30 cents, a year earlier. The latest figures exclude an after-tax
investment gain of CDollars 41.7m, stemming mainly from the sale of a 46.3
per cent stake in Aberfoyle, the Australian group.
Revenues rose to CDollars 357m from CDollars 304.8m.
