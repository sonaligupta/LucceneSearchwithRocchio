FT  06 AUG 93 / Local forums will aim to reach consensus


   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent


AS PART of plans to speed up the road-building programme, a new form of
consultation is to be tried out initially with two schemes, one in Cornwall
and one in Hereford.
The plan is for a 'round-table conference of interested parties' to try to
reach a consensus over the need for and route of the schemes. In both trial
cases the road schemes are the subject of strong environmental objections.
In Cornwall the proposed conference, to be held locally early next year,
will consider plans for a 'missing link' of dual carriageway on the A30 near
Indian Queens, a notorious traffic bottleneck, especially during the holiday
season. The Pounds 18m scheme for 6.3 miles of road would link the Bodmin
bypass with the Indian Queens bypass, on which work started last month. It
is contentious because of the impact on Goss Moor, a national nature
reserve.
Mr MacGregor yesterday said that there was no easy answer to the problem of
the road. He added that if the conference led to an acceptable proposal the
scheme would still be subject to normal statutory procedures.
The conference at Hereford will consider proposals for relieving the city's
traffic congestion in the wake of the rejection of a Department of Transport
scheme proposing an 8.5-mile bypass of the A49 dual carriageway. This ran
into heavy opposition because it would cross river meadows.
After a 12-month public inquiry the inspector rejected that proposal.
Hereford and Worcester County Council said yesterday: 'Conservationists were
ecstatic, but the local business and industrial lobby was, to say the least,
displeased.'
Mr Colin Beardwood, chairman of the county council's strategic planning and
transport committee, said the council would support the idea of a forum.
