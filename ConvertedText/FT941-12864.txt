FT  28 JAN 94 / Creditors of BCCI threaten Abu Dhabi


   By ANDREW JACK


   LONDON


A group of creditors of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce
International is threatening to sue the government of Abu Dhabi, the bank's
majority shareholder, for a larger settlement, writes Andrew Jack in London.
Creditors owed about Dollars 2bn by BCCI yesterday agreed to push for 'a
just and immediate' payment from Abu Dhabi. A meeting in Cairo included
representatives from the Islamic banks in the Middle East and was convened
by Mr Adil Elias, a member of the BCCI creditors' committee and one of three
creditors who opposed in the courts the previous agreement between BCCI's
liquidators and Abu Dhabi.
Mr Elias said yesterday that unless Abu Dhabi contributed Dollars
3bn-Dollars 4bn to the creditors, his group would sue to recover their own
claims plus damages through the courts in England, and possibly Luxembourg
and the US.
