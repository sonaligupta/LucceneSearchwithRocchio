FT  16 DEC 94 / International Company News: Clark USA cancels plans for
fundraising


   By ROBERT GIBBENS


Clark USA, the oil refiner and distributor controlled by Toronto financier
Mr Peter Munk, has withdrawn a USDollars 250m financing because of weakening
capital markets, writes Robert Gibbens.
Clark, wholly-owned by Horsham Corp, Mr Munk's main holding company, had
planned to offer 7.5m shares publicly to raise Dollars 150m, and to issue
Dollars 100m of senior notes.
The shares would have represented one-third of the total outstanding. The
financing was to cover the acquisition of a Chevron refinery in the US.
'We won't sell our shares in a weak market,' said Mr Paul Melnuk, Clark
president. 'Clark is a successful independent refiner and marketer and
financially strong. We believe market conditions will improve later.'
Clark earned Dollars 20.4m in the first nine months, compared with a loss of
Dollars 4.9m last time.
