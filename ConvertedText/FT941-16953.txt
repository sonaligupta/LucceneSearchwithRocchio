FT  07 JAN 94 / Reno rejects pleaon Clinton probe


   By REUTER


   WASHINGTON


Attorney General Janet Reno yesterday rejected demands by Republicans in
Congress for a special prosecutor in an investigation involving President
Clinton's financial dealings in Arkansas and defended the way a subpoena had
been issued for his records, Reuter reports from Washington.
Asked by reporters at her weekly news conference if she thought the
political independence of the justice department had been preserved in the
serving of the subpoena two weeks ago, Ms Reno tersely replied, 'Yes.'
Mr Clinton's personal lawyer has advised the president to hand over the
records only under subpoena, thus assuring that the documents will not be
made public. But the subpoena caused top congressional Republicans to accuse
the justice department of colluding with the White House to shield documents
on Mr Clinton's role in the failed Arkansas real estate venture.
'It's mind-boggling to think that the White House and the justice department
would work together in a matter that might involve some criminal activity,'
Senate Republican leader Bob Dole said on Fox television's Morning News in
renewing his call for an independent special counsel.
House Republican leader Newt Gingrich on the NBC 'Today' programme
de-nounced as 'very, very disturbing' the way the subpoena had been handled.
'To have the White House going to the justice department to apparently
collude together to get a subpoena so the American people can't see the
documents - there's something a little bit sick about that kind of
approach,' he said.
White House spokeswoman Ms Dee Dee Myers said the personal lawyer for the
president and Hillary Rodham Clinton yesterday began to turn over the
documents, totalling five or six boxes of records.
