FT  20 MAY 92 / Letter: Clarifying advisers' position


   From JACK BEATSON


Sir, The statement that regulators and firms believe that the present
uncertainty about the impact of the Financial Services Act on the common law
fiduciary duties of advisers and brokers is preferable to the introduction
of new legislation ('Results of City rules review welcomed', May 12) does
not represent the complete picture.
The responses to a questionnaire circulated by the Law Commission in
November 1990 to firms, individuals, regulatory bodies and organisations
representing the different interests involved (business, professional and
consumer interests) revealed that while many respondents were of the view
set out in your article, many others, including City solicitors, regulatory
bodies and several merchant banks, believe that the present uncertainty is
unacceptable.
For example, provision is made in regulatory rules for 'Chinese walls' but,
although in some instances courts have taken account of regulatory rules in
determining whether common law and fiduciary duties have been complied with,
on those occasions in which courts have considered the efficacy of 'Chinese
walls' (most recently last year) they have not been seen as providing
satisfactory protection for clients.
The Law Commission provisionally believes that a short piece of legislation
is necessary to clarify the legal position by providing that account should
be taken of reasonable regulatory rules when determining the content of
fiduciary duties. This would not represent a further upheaval for firms and
their customers. It would rather facilitate the efficient functioning of the
market by introducing reasonable certainty as to the duties of advisers,
brokers and other practitioners.
However the Law Commission wants to obtain as many views as possible on the
various options for reform set out in its consultation paper before
finalising its recommendations.
