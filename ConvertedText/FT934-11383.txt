FT  01 NOV 93 / Observer: Hot property


The rest of Europe may fiddle, but the mighty Deutsche Bank seems to have
its eye on the main chance. Last week, Germany's leading commercial bank
completed probably the largest property deal in the British capital in more
than two years when it acquired, through its 60 per cent-owned subsidiary
DGI, the long leasehold of One Exchange Square.
So now that it has become landlord to the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development, why not offer that other breed of Eurobankers a home as
well, seeing the EMI has been secured by Frankfurt?
After all, the idea that Europe's new central bank should be housed in the
cavernous IG Farben building was always faintly risible, given that the
simply vast edifice built for the pre-1945 chemical conglomerate has since
housed as many as 60,000 US soldiers.
As the Bundesbank has rented a number of floors in the landmark Messeturm
skyscraper, that too is ruled out if the new Eurocrats are to be spared
waspish words in the elevators.
But what about the so-called Trianon, the brand new building a D-Mark's
throw away from Deutsche Bank's twin towers? Ten floors higher, it was
originally supposed to be the new headquarters of BfG, but it was snapped up
by Deutsche when the former union bank fell on hard times. It is only two
thirds let, so EMI president designate Alexandre Lamfalussy might like to
turn up to the dedication bash this Thursday to have a look around.
Then again it is perhaps not a long-term solution. Intended to be redolent
of Marie-Antoinette's village in the grounds of Versailles, the name of the
building could prove something of an embarrassment, as EU enlargement
progresses. Not everyone will have forgotten the 1920 Trianon treaty
according to which two thirds of Hungary's territory was confiscated after
the first world war.
