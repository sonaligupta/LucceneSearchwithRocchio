FT  22 OCT 92 / Letter: Grey chill scars French fashion


   From Ms SUZANNE JEAN-BAPTISTE


Sir, Are we seeing the first signs of strain on the French design industry?
In reference to 'The colour is grey for Paris spring fashions: Economic
chill takes the brightness out of French designers' big week' (October 14),
I must agree, and add that the French design industry will survive the
recession, but with scars.
The currency crisis, the depression of sales and bankruptcy of designers,
are results to be expected from the recession. However, stiff competition
from other luxury goods such as Dunhill and LVMH and the decision by
Japanese designers to withdraw from the Paris fashion scene will not leave
the French design industry unscathed. Such competition will benefit the
consumer. There will be a larger market of goods at reasonably affordable
prices, greater variety and better quality.
