FT  11 APR 94 / Company News (This Week): Disposals create platform for
continental push - Forte


Forte's figures for the year to January, to be announced on Thursday, cover
an eventful period for the UK's leading hotels group. A successful disposal
programme has left it poised to pursue expansion into continental Europe,
where its efforts have been rather less successful.
Disposal gains will distort the headline figures, but underlying pre-tax
profits are expected to rise from Pounds 71m to Pounds 85m-Pounds 90m -
after a reduced interest bill that still stands at roughly Pounds 100m.
Profits from continental Europe are expected to be unchanged, with good
improvements from the UK hotels.
Analysts will be eager to hear about trends in rates and occupancy levels,
but some are concerned about the effects on US visitors of the IRA mortar
attacks on Heathrow.
They are also likely to question the company about the new FRS5 accounting
standard which deals with off-balance sheet debt. Forte has done sale and
leaseback deals on around Pounds 400m of hotels, and believes it can leave
the assets and liabilities off its balance sheet under the new standard.
Bringing them on would increase gearing and replace leasing costs with
higher interest charges, leaving profits unaffected.
Further asset write-downs are expected - following the previous year's
Pounds 344m hit - but the balance sheet is now much healthier thanks to
disposals, including the Pounds 177m injection from the flotation of the
Alpha Airports catering and duty free retailing business in February.
This has given it the wherewithal to enter the bidding for Air France's
Meridien chain after its offer for the Aga Khan's Ciga hotels was trumped by
Sheraton.
Following the dividend cut last year analysts expect maintained payments of
7.5p which are still unlikely to be covered by underlying earnings per
share.
