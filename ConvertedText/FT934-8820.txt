FT  13 NOV 93 / Businessmen cleared


TWO businessmen who ran Therm-A-Stor, a double-glazing company, were both
cleared of fraudulent trading charges after the Serious Fraud Office dropped
its prosecution more than six weeks into the trial. It had alleged at
Birmingham Crown Court that Mr John Morris, the company's founder, and Mr
Anthony Bonnar, managing director, had defrauded customers and suppliers of
more than Pounds 12m.
The SFO said the trial had been abandoned after the emergence of unforeseen
evidence.
