FT  27 JAN 94 / People: Allan moves to Kent Tec


Kent Training and Enterprise Council has appointed a new chief executive,
Malcolm Allan, who will spearhead the Tec's enlarging role in the economic
development of Kent.
Allan, aged 44, has been chief executive of Sussex Tec for the past three
years. He succeeds John Forsdyke, who relinquishes his post at Easter.
More than 160 applications were made for the post. The job is an expanded
one, as it is planned that the new chief executive will be at the helm of a
new organisation made up of the Tec and Kent County Council's economic
development unit.
Agreement in principle has been reached on the merger of the county's unit
with the Tec, although detailed negotiations are still proceeding.
The intention is to rationalise and develop services to business in Kent,
Britain's front door into the Economic Union, under the Tec's leadership.
The merger could provide a model for other Tecs, all of which are seeking to
bring greater coherence to the delivery of economic development within their
localities.
