FT  08 JUN 92 / Construction Contracts: Superstore scheme in Plymouth


BOVIS CONSTRUCTION, a P&O Company, has been awarded a Pounds 7.6m management
contract to build and fit out a 46,500 sq ft store for Safeway on the
outskirts of Plymouth.
Bovis is breaking new ground with this project, which is being built above a
series of natural springs, requiring the installation of a special
geotextile membrane beneath the building.
Used more frequently on civil engineering projects, this is believed to be
the first time this technique has been employed to protect a building.
The membrane (which consists of one impervious and one pervious layer) will
filter the natural water as it rises, diverting it to the sides of the
store, where it will then flow into special drainage channels.
Construction work has already started to excavate the 4.5 acre site to a
depth of 12 ft in readiness for the membrane. Once it is in place, work will
start on the single-storey steel-framed structure.
The exterior of the store will feature decorative arches, clad with Blenheim
natural brick, and a flat roof finished with slate clad mansards.
