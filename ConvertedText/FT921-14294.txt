FT  16 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Triplex Lloyd in double purchase


Triplex Lloyd, the engineering group with interests in the power, automotive
and building products sectors, has made two acquisitions for a total
consideration of up to Pounds 4.98m.
For an initial Pounds 2.75m, it is buying Paralloy, a specialist producer of
horizontal centrifugally-spun high alloy tubing, fabricated assemblies and
static cast fittings, mostly for the petrochemical industry. Further
consideration of Pounds 750,000 will become due if profits for the year to
March 31 1992 exceed Pounds 672,000.
The other company acquired is Precision Castparts - to be renamed Centaur
Precision. The Pounds 1.48m purchase price is to be financed out of
Triplex's own resources.
