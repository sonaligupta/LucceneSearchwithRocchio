FT  12 APR 94 / International Company News: Quarterly profit at Australian
Alcoa slips


   By BRUCE JACQUES

Directors of Alcoa of Australia, the integrated aluminium producer, have
warned that any recovery will be constrained following a 5.6 per cent fall
in net profit in the March quarter to ADollars 76.3m (USDollars 53.7m) from
ADollars 80.9m a year ago. Revenues were 1 per cent higher at ADollars
509.8m, against ADollars 504.7.
Directors said the result reflected lower prices for all products, partially
offset by increased sales volumes of alumina, lower unit production and
lower taxes.
'First-quarter results should not be taken as indicative of results for the
remainder of 1994,' they said.
'Conditions in the industry remain difficult, and although a number of
producers have communicated they will cut back metal production, inventories
remain high and will constrain recovery in the industry.'
Tax provision was down to ADollars 440.2m from ADollars 55.2m in the period,
while depreciation took ADollars 36.4m, against ADollars 36.7m. Interest
expense was down to ADollars 4.8m from ADollars 7.1m.
