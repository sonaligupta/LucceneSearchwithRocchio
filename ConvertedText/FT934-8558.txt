FT  15 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Dilemma at the centre of 'A' level
intake


   From Mr G P GALLIE


Sir, Your survey of October 31 in which a selection of schools is ranked by
the students' 'A' level results presents a dilemma which I should like to
share with you. While the articles associated with the statistics indicate
the caution with which they have to be interpreted, they do not present
clearly what appears to me to be a central issue.
Like many comprehensive schools, we are now accepting a rising proportion of
our students on to 'A' level courses which were intended originally for the
most able 25 per cent of the population. We receive about 200 children of
all abilities each year from the neighbourhood, and have for several years
accepted some 35 per cent of these to study for 'A' levels.
In recent years this proportion has increased to 55 per cent, and the
'additional' students have largely gained reasonable 'A' level grades. They
have been accepted into higher education courses and we are confident that
they have benefited from their time in the sixth form.
We could, very simply, raise our score and find a high place on your
listings by restricting our entry into 'A' level to the figures of three
years ago. We shall not do so, in the interests of students, parents and of
employers. However, by encouraging more students to aim higher we shall
appear to be achieving less than many of the schools in your list. Are those
lists really serving a valuable educational purpose?
Incidentally, we believe that we offer 'good value for money'. The annual
cost of educating each student at this school, now borne almost entirely
through funds delegated to the school, is Pounds 1,820. Our 'A' level
results compare favourably with many schools working on double that figure.
