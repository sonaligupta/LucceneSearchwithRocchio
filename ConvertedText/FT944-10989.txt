FT  08 NOV 94 / International Company News: Growth in demand lifts Malaysian
utility


   By KIERAN COOKE


   KUALA LUMPUR


Tenaga Nasional, Malaysia's partially-privatised electricity utility, has
announced pre-tax profits for the year ending August 31 1994 of MDollars
1.98bn (USDollars 772m), a 7 per cent rise on the previous year's figure,
writes Kieran Cooke in Kuala Lumpur. About 25 per cent of Tenaga Nasional
was floated in 1990 and the group now ranks as the biggest company on the
Kuala Lumpur stock market. Group turnover for the year rose 12 per cent to
MDollars 5.63bn.
Tenaga said the main reason for the rise in earnings had been the continuing
strong growth in electricity demand.
Malaysia's economy is forecast to expand by 8.5 per cent this year, the
seventh consecutive year in which growth has exceeded 8 per cent.
Electricity sales rose by 14 per cent in the year to August and are forecast
to grow by 12.7 per cent in 1995.
A final dividend of Malaysian 7 cents was approved, making 12 cents for the
year.
As part of a long term plan to increase Malaysia's power output, the
government has so far granted licences to five independent power producers
(IPPs) on a build, operate, transfer basis. The IPPs are expected to account
for about 40 per cent of total power generation by 1998.
