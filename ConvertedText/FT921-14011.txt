FT  17 JAN 92 / International Company News: Carolco reprieved by finance
deal worth Dollars 55m


   By ALAN FRIEDMAN


CAROLCO Pictures, the troubled independent Hollywood film studio, said
yesterday it had secured Dollars 45m of financing and a deferral on Dollars
10m of debts from US and foreign lenders. The funds will allow it to
continue operating.
Carolco, best known for Terminator 2, the Arnold Schwarzenegger blockbuster,
is caught in a financial squeeze along with other independent film
companies. Orion Pictures, the bigger independent, recently filed for
protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of US bankruptcy law.
Carolco's problems have been mounting since last summer. In November it
ended talks aimed at acquiring a 46 per cent shareholding in Live
Entertainment, a home video supplier majority-controlled by Carolco. In
December, Carolco cut its staff of 200 by 25 per cent and said it was
considering scaling back a number of deals with film makers.
For much of last year the company was in technical default on Dollars 172m
of bank loans. In the third quarter it suffered a Dollars 43.7m loss. At the
year-end, Mr Peter Hoffman, chief executive, said he would leave the company
following what analysts described as internal management conflicts.
The Dollars 45m financial package was approved by Carolco's foreign minority
shareholders - Pioneer of Japan, Rizzoli of Italy and Canal Plus of France.
It consists of a Dollars 32m loan secured on Carolco's 53 per cent stake in
Live Entertainment, plus a new issue of Dollars 13m of preferred stock
convertible into common shares. The foreign shareholders have agreed to
defer receipt of Dollars 10m of payments owed to them.
Carolco's share price rose Dollars  1/2 to close at Dollars 2 1/2.
