FT  16 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Qantas plans China service


   By NIKKI TAIT

Qantas, the large Australian airline in which British Airways holds a
minority stake, has said that it wants to re-start a service to China on
June 1 - a move which could sound the death knell for the fledgling
Australian carrier Australia Air International. AA secured rights to China
last year from the International Air Services Commission, which allocates
Australia's international routes.
At that stage, Qantas, which ceased operations to China in 1987, did not
make an application. AA had hoped to start operating in 1993, and even
published proposed schedules but the carrier subsequently failed to meet
IASC financial requirements. Qantas plans a once-a-week flight to Beijing
via Guangzhou, using a Boeing 767 aircraft.
