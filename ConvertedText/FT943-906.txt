FT  27 SEP 94 / Observer: Frying tonight


Calling all under-employed Eurocrats - if that isn't something of a
tautology. Get to work on rescuing Belgium's national snack, chips doused in
mayonnaise. A potato shortage, caused partly by the hot summer, partly by
farmers planting fewer spuds last season as a result of low prices, is
threatening to extinguish the Belgian chips'n'mayonnaise snack, or at least
convert it into something of a luxury.
An opportunity here for Britain's Potato Marketing Board to justify its
temporary reprieve and lend its support to the vanishing Belgian pomme
frite?
