FT  04 AUG 92 / Alcohol policies more prevalent


THREE quarters of British employers have policies to deal with problem
drinking at work, according to a survey of 450 organisations.
More than 50 per cent of organisations either incorporate policies on
alcohol abuse into disciplinary procedures or operate an 'unwritten
understanding' on it, according to the IRS Employment Trends, the magazine
of the pay research group.
Policies often stipulate strict penalties for those found drunk at work,
which often include dismissal. A growing number of employers now test and
search employees for alcohol, especially in safety-sensitive areas such as
transport and offshore oil exploration.
The survey finds that organisations are beginning to treat problem drinkers
with greater sensitivity. More are offering counselling and other services
to employees who accept that they have alcohol problems.
