FT  27 JUL 92 / International Company News: Uni Storebrand chief quits


   By REUTER


   OSLO


MR Jan Erik Langangen has resigned as president of Uni Storebrand, Norway's
biggest insurer, Reuter reports from Oslo.
Mr Per Terje Vold, vice-president of the life insurance division, is taking
over.
'The board of Uni Storebrand has this afternoon accepted Jan Erik
Langangen's wish to resign as company president with immediate effect,' Uni
Storebrand said.
Mr Langangen has been criticised for letting Uni Storebrand buy 28 per cent
of Swedish insurer Forsakrings AB Skandia and trying to force it into a
Nordic Co-operation Pact. This plan has so far failed and it is not clear
what Uni Storebrand will do with its stake in Skandia.
