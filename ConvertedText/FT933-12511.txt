FT  23 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Accounting changes flatter Hill & Smith


   By CATHERINE MILTON


PRE-TAX profits at Hill & Smith Holdings, the steel stockholding, forging
and fabricated products group, improved from Pounds 1.24m to Pounds 1.48m in
the six months to end-March in spite of a small drop in sales.
The company's compliance with FRS 3 flattered profits by depressing the
comparative figure with a one-off exceptional charge of Pounds 212,000 for
losses on the May 1992 disposal of a stockholding subsidiary.
Loss-making Tipton Steel Stockholders (Stoke) was sold to Richardson
Westgarth and in March 1992 Hill & Smith bought Duct & Access Covers, a
manhole maker, which supplies the communications industry.
The transactions caused a net drop in turnover of about Pounds 500,000 and
sales dipped to Pounds 31.5m (Pounds 31.8m). Mr Michael Sara, group managing
director, said: 'We sold a loss-making company and bought one that makes
profits. That's why our profits have gone up.'
He added: 'The market for manhole covers is good in parts. Sales to BT have
been flat, to cable TV, fairly good and to construction, poor.' A slightly
firmer property market meant demand for building products, such as steel
lintels, was improving.
The company had experienced a 'very poor start' to its financial year: 'The
economy was diabolical in October and November, though from that period
things improved gradually until March. From March things have been a little
unsteady, but have levelled off to a point higher than in the autumn.'
The interim dividend is 2.1p, which taking into account the 1-for-15 scrip
issue in March, represents a 6.6 per cent increase. Earnings per share
improved to 3.34p (2.79p).
