FT  21 OCT 92 / International Company News: AMB-BfG wrangle takes twist


   By DAVID WALLER


   FRANKFURT


THE COMPLEX cross-border wrangle over the fate of Aachener und Munchener
Beteiligungs (AMB), Germany's second-largest insurance company, and BfG
Bank, its majority-owned subsidiary, has taken another twist.
A Frankfurt lawyer has launched a move to pressure Assurances Generales de
France (AGF), the French insurance company which has spent in excess of
DM1.1bn (Dollars 741m) to buy a 25-plus per cent stake in AMB, into making a
full takeover offer.
Mr Nicolaus-Jurgen Weickart is complaining that the interests of the
majority of shareholders in AMB have been neglected.
He has assembled a group of AMB shareholders - representing some 10 per cent
of the total - who object to the rapprochement between AMB and AGF. Last
July, a deal was reached whereby AMB abandoned its hostility to AGF and
agreed to recognise the voting rights on the majority of AMB's shares.
These agreements were reached by the supervisory boards of the two companies
over the heads of Mr Wolf-Dieter Baumgartl, then the AMB chief executive,
and without reference to shareholders. Mr Baumgartl subsequently resigned.
Mr Weickart has put pressure on AMB to call a special annual general meeting
at which shareholders will be obliged to agree any sale of BfG and to
approve the giving of full voting rights to AMB. Given the likely opposition
of Fondiaria, the Italian insurance company which has 20 per cent of AMB, it
is possible that AGF and associated shareholders could be voted down at the
meeting, which is likely to take place around the turn of the year.
