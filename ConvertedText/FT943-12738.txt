FT  23 JUL 94 / Vote on German troops


   By AP


   BONN


The German parliament voted yesterday to allow German troops to fight
outside the Nato region, by 424 votes to 48. The decision, which was
necessary to ratify the constitutional court ruling on German troops' role
in the former Yugoslavia, was opposed by the Greens and former Communists.
Mr Rudolf Scharping, of the opposition Social Democratic party, warned that
Germany should not always fight when called on by its allies, and that
German development programmes should not be replaced by overseas military
action. Defence Minister Mr Volker Ruhe said the high court decision 'isn't
a marching order' and denied that it would lead to Germany sending troops to
every trouble spot. Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister and leader of the Free
Democratic party, accused the SPD of retreating into a false pacifism. 'The
lesson to be drawn from the Nazi era is that violence can often only be
defeated by counter-violence,' Mr Kinkel said.
