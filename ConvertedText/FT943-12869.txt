FT  22 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Aid to Air France will hit emergence
of low-cost airlines


   From Mr JOHN PARR


Sir, We here disturbed to read the report by Emma Tucker and John Ridding on
Air France's bid for further state aid ('Brussels set to back state aid for
ailing Air France', July 21).
The further propping up of this carrier will do as much harm to air
transport users as it will to competitor airlines. Under pressure from the
French government, Air France is flying routes that are not economically
viable given its cost structure. This not only undermines the profitability
of current competitors but also deters the emergence of new low-cost
airlines.
It is vital that the Commission requires Air France to make big cuts in
capacity. In markets which are not overshadowed by a state-supported carrier
we are now witnessing a significant number of new services, often provided
by new regional airlines.
These carriers must be able to establish themselves now, as air travel
growth resumes, if they are to stand any chance of longer-term survival. The
provision of more state aid can only hinder them and will for the
foreseeable future deny users the full benefits of liberalisation.
