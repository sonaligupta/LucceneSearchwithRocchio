FT  27 MAY 93 / International Company News: Compaq Computer optimistic on
outlook

COMPAQ Computer expects a strong second-quarter performance, the company
said yesterday.
Mr Andreas Barth, senior vice-president, Europe, said his forecast was based
on the first signs of economic recovery in Europe and the surge in demand
generated by the introduction of the 486SL-based Compaq Contura and Compaq
LTE Lite notebook ranges in March and May.
First-quarter net income, reported last month, jumped to Dollars 102m, or
Dollars 1.23 a share, from Dollars 45m, or 53 cents, on revenues 106 per
cent higher at Dollars 1.6bn.
The company confirmed in a statement that it took the lead in the European
portable PC market for the first time in the quarter. The group held a 22
per cent market share in value terms and a 17.5 per cent market share in
unit terms, according to Dataquest, a market research business.
First-quarter portable shipments grew by 89 per cent over the same period
last year, more than four times faster than the market, which increased by
21 per cent, the company said.
Mr Barth said the company would continue to target the European market with
product introductions and aggressive pricing.
In North America, Compaq's portables market share rose by 65 per cent,
reaching 17.6 per cent for the first quarter, against 11.4 per cent at the
end of last year.
The company's success in notebooks contrasts with that of rival Dell
Computer, which on Tuesday reported a steep fall in first-quarter income as
a result of delayed and cancelled notebook projects.
Novell, the US computer networking company,
released second-quarter figures showing net income up 31 per cent to Dollars
80m, or 26 cents a share, on revenue 25 per cent ahead at Dollars 281m.
