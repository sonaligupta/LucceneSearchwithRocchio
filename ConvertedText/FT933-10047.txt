FT  06 AUG 93 / Ship survey and certification work to be contracted out


   By JOHN WILLMAN


ABOUT 25 per cent of the ship survey and certification work undertaken by
the Surveyor General's Organisation of the Department of Transport is to be
contracted out to the private sector, John Willman writes.
The move was announced yesterday by Lord Caithness, minister for shipping.
The organisation regulates the safety and pollution prevention requirements
for ships and their equipment.
Consultation with the shipping industry revealed considerable resistance to
more contracting out. Critics believed such a move might detract from the
independent role of the organisation and jeopardise marine safety.
The organisation will retain direct involvement in survey and certification
of passenger certificates. It will also remain involved in all surveys of
items directly related to safety of passengers and crew.
