FT  09 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Ford in Dollars 15m Chinese venture


   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent


Ford, the US carmaker, is to invest Dollars 15m in a joint venture in China
to produce automotive electronic components, its third components venture in
China this year. The world's second largest vehicle maker hopes that the
components operations will open the way for it to begin assembling vehicles
in China in the near future.
'We are eager to establish vehicle assembly projects in China at the
earliest opportunity,' Mr Frank Macher, Ford vice president and general
manager of the automotive components division said yesterday. Ford signed an
agreement yesterday with Shanghai Automation Instrumentation for the
production of a range of automotive electronic components to supply vehicle
makers both in China and in other Asian markets.
A new plant is to be built in Shanghai with production scheduled to begin in
June, 1986. Earlier this year Ford agreed joint ventures with Shanghai
Automotive Industry for the production of plastic automotive components -
output begins this month - and with Shanghai Yao Hua Glass Works for the
production of automotive safety glass, which has already begun operations.
Mr Macher said that a further venture to make climate control systems,
including air-conditioning, heating and ventilation, could be signed by the
end of the year. This would involve an investment of Dollars 20m-Dollars
30m.
