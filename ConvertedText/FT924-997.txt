FT  21 DEC 92 / Fabius to be tried over HIV blood


   By WILLIAM DAWKINS


   PARIS


THE French parliament voted at the weekend to send Mr Laurent Fabius, leader
of the Socialist party, and two former ministers to trial, over a scandal in
which more than 1,200 haemophiliacs were infected by blood tainted with the
HIV virus, writes William Dawkins in Paris.
The complex and rarely used process could take years to reach a conclusion.
The national assembly voted overwhelmingly on Saturday followed by the
Senate yesterday to send Mr Fabius, prime minister when the national blood
transfusion service supplied the infected blood in 1985, before a
parliamentary high court, along with Mrs Georgina Dufoix, former social
affairs minister and Mr Edmond Herve, former health minister.
