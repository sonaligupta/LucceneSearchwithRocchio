FT  05 AUG 93 / Level of business failures falls for fourth month


THE NUMBER of businesses going into receivership has fallen for the fourth
month in a row, according to figures released yesterday by Touche Ross, the
accountancy firm.
July saw 239 administration orders and receivership appointments - half the
number that there were in July last year.
Mr Christopher Morris, insolvency partner at Touche Ross, said there was
every indication that receivership would remain at the same level or decline
even further in the coming months. 'The reduction is indicative of the haul
out of recession and also suggests that companies are not yet suffering from
cash flow pressures which are a common feature of recovery,' he said.
A regional breakdown of the figures shows a particular drop in appointments
in London and south-east England - with 89 appointments in July, compared
with an average of 180 a month last year. Recovery still seems slower in
north-west England, and the Yorkshire and Humberside regions. For the second
month running there were hardly any appointments in Scotland - three in
July, against four in June.
The property and construction sectors saw 37 appointments in July, against
an average of 81 a month in 1992. Most other sectors showed a 'steady
downward trend', although the hotel and catering trades were recovering more
slowly with 21 appointments against the 1992 average of 27.
Mr Morris said: 'The trends these figures indicate fully support the view
that the British economy is recovering. Whether coincidence or not, I
speculate that there may be some correlation between the drop in the number
of appointments and key factors affecting business confidence. The first
major drop in the rate of appointments in April 1992 coincided with the
Conservatives winning the general election and the second drop in April 1993
followed on from the reversal of unemployment trends.'
