FT  20 MAY 92 / Letter: The costs of Concorde that should not be ignored


   From Sir ROBIN MAXWELL-HYSLOP


Sir, Paul Taylor blandly states ('Concorde: a hard act to follow', business
air travel survey, May 11) that 10 years after its introduction on to the
North Atlantic service 'British Airways was able to report that the aircraft
was making a healthy profit'. Yet nowhere does he report that the aircraft
were a free gift from the taxpayer to British Airways for which the latter
declined to pay a penny of purchase price. Nor did that exhaust the public
subsidy of this operation: as the select committee on industry and trade
recorded in its report on the Concorde in April 1981, there was continuing
project support from public funds, which the Department of Trade and
Industry then expected to amount to about Pounds 123m between 1980-1985.
Against this the provision for BA to repay part of its operating surplus to
the government permitted even this to be offset by earlier operating losses,
and certain 'post-review capital expenditure'.
Unless it is seriously suggested that the taxpayer should again pay huge
sums of public money to subsidise supersonic flight in a new generation of
aircraft, nobody should be misled into making false judgments about
commercial viability based on Concorde experience.
Another omission from the article is the cost to other airlines of Concorde
being given priority passage through a 'stack' in which less privileged
aircraft are forced to keep their passengers waiting to land because
Concorde has such alarming fuel flows at low speed and altitude.
The prospect of greatly extending the nuisance, and very possibly structural
damage, caused by secondary shock waves from Concorde also needs to be faced
before any investment in further supersonic aircraft development takes
place.
