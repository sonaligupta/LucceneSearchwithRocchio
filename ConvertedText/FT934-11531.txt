FT  30 OCT 93 / Food & Drink: Appetisers


   By JILL JAMES


THE Lanesborough hotel in central London will be hosting an Italian festival
with guest chef Giuseppe Vitaglione (from the Il San Pietro di Positano in
Amalfi) cooking from November 23 to 28.
The first 20 Weekend FT readers who book lunch or dinner there that week
will be offered a free bottle of Antinori's Poggio Alle Gazzio (white) or Le
Volte (red) which normally retail at Pounds 27.50 and Pounds 35 in the
restaurant. Tel: 071-259 5599.
To add to the festive scene in London, a Taste of Indonesia festival was
launched this week at The Lowndes, a Hyatt hotel in Belgravia. Chef Karno
Suwito has flown in from the Hyatt in Jakarta to help direct operations in
the kitchens. A three-course meal with Indonesian beer should cost about
Pounds 25 per head although real gourmands might like to try the traditional
rijsttafel of more than a dozen different courses. The festival runs until
November 21. Tel: 071-823-1234.
Holme Farmed Venison has set up a mail order business. The company, based at
Holme House Farm, Raisbeck, Penrith, Cumbria, CA10 3SG, has developed a
range of products which can be eaten all year round including venison haunch
steaks, sausages, burgers and casserole in red wine. Products arrive ready
for use or freezing. For details tel: 05396-24618 or fax: 05396-24551.
Finally, you do not have to be toothless or aged to enjoy The Oldie Cookbook
by James Page-Roberts (The Carbery Press, Pounds 5.95, 224 pages) which is
full of simple, value for money recipes.
