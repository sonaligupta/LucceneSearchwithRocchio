FT  12 NOV 92 / Letter: Forced to forget principles


   From Mr E N ADDISON


Sir, The last sentence in your last paragraph of your leader, 'The Matrix
case' (November 10), tells in effect the whole story of this debacle. You
realise now that as a supporter of the Common Market you have to behave like
your partners do - put your country first and forget your high principles.
It is also the reason why people like Alan Clark, the former trade minister,
are of the right calibre to deal in our negotiations, as he has exactly the
same attitude as have all our European partners. There were considerably
more machine tools from the US, Germany, Italy, Switzerland and France used
in the Iraq factories, although they all subscribed to the UN arms embargo
and no fuss was made in these countries about their involvement, which was
taken for granted.
Because of the internecine fight between government departments and the
behaviour of our MPs, things have come out which would have been better left
unsaid. This is the tragedy of it all and responsibility for this lies
fairly and squarely with Civil Service intellectuals and MPs, both
categories being completely devoid of any common sense.
