FT  03 AUG 92 / N-plant cottage attracts buyers


   By CHRIS TIGHE


AT LEAST one house for sale in Britain looks likely to find a buyer even
though it has the Sellafield nuclear waste reprocessing plant as its
next-door neighbour.
Coombe Cottage, a detached three-bedroomed property with a pink bathroom
suite and imposing views of the Sellafield complex, stands a few yards from
the north gate of the site and within its 2km emergency evacuation zone.
Although in a cul-de-sac, it suffers from heavy traffic at shift changes as
many hundreds of Sellafield workers drive past.
Yet while appealing properties in quiet avenues all over Britain languish
for lack of buyers, this bizarrely situated home has attracted offers,
including one just Pounds 2,500 short of its Pounds 47,500 asking price.
Mitchells Lakeland Properties, the estate agents, say the location of the
cottage - the nearest private property to the Sellafield site - has neither
deterred would-be buyers nor deflated the asking price, which is on a par
with freehold houses elsewhere in west Cumbria. It is understood it is being
sold by the family of an elderly woman who lived there until recently.
'There's been quite a lot of interest in it,' the agents said. 'We have a
couple of offers on it and it's standing at Pounds 45,000 at the moment.
It's a nice little cottage - it's been very popular.'
British Nuclear Fuels, Sellafield's operator, owns some formerly private
farms on the coast around the site. The agents said BNFL was interested in
Coombe Cottage, which has been on the market since March, but declined to
say whether it had made an offer. The company said it would not
automatically buy a property because it was so near the site.
The keenest buyers would probably have been anti-nuclear groups, for whom it
would have been ideal as a 'shop window' for protests but the price has
deterred them.
