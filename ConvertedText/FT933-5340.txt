FT  03 SEP 93 / International Company News: Delta warns it may cut routes


   By KAREN ZAGOR


DELTA Air Lines, one of the three big US carriers, has warned it may have to
cancel unprofitable routes. The warning comes despite an improvement in its
loss-making transatlantic routes over the summer.
Mr Ron Allen, chairman, admitted that the company's foray into Europe had
been more difficult than expected. Delta was essentially a domestic carrier
until it bought Pan Am's transatlantic routes two years ago.
'We have had lower market share, poorer economic conditions, higher
structural costs and greater start-up costs than anticipated over the north
Atlantic,' he said. 'Pan Am had a name that was known around the world.
Delta's name is not that well known around the world.'
Mr Allen said Delta's transatlantic performance had improved between June
and August, with its load factor rising to 73 per cent from 70 per cent and
revenues at its Frankfurt hub up about 50 per cent. Although he would not
say whether the routes had been profitable over summer, he did say: 'If we
can keep on the present trends, then I think it (the transatlantic routes)
can be a profitable contributor in 1994.'
The carrier has already cancelled some of its German routes. Mr Allen said:
'We will do more of this as we look at our summer results and decide which
routes cannot be profitable.' Some routes may be consolidated. He said Delta
had no plans to leave any markets entirely, nor was it planning a radical
restructuring.
