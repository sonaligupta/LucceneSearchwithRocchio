FT  19 APR 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Report on the future of
the USM - In a Nutshell


On Thursday the board of the London Stock Exchange will catch a glimpse of
findings from a Mori survey gauging whether or not the Unlisted Securities
Market should be replaced.
The survey conducted among a wide range of stock market practitioners,
venture capital houses and the directors of unquoted businesses was
delivered to the Stock Exchange in March. But the Exchange is unlikely to
release the raw survey material or any recommendations to the board for at
least a month.
When the Stock Exchange's Smaller Companies Working Party finished
discussing the case for an 'enterprise market' last year, market
practitioners sensed hostility towards the idea from the Exchange.
Since then Michael Lawrence, the Stock Exchange's new chief executive, has
been taking soundings from advocates of a new enterprise market, some of
whom now sense a greater degree of support.
The USM closes at the end of 1996 but no new listings will be accepted after
this year. Those who support a replacement argue that if investors cannot
see an exit route for their investments they are less likely to provide
capital at an early stage to small but potentially rapidly growing
companies.
