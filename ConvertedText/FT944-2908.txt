FT  15 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Wartsila links with Cummins

Finland's Wartsila Diesel and Cummins Engine of the US, two of the world's
leading diesel engine manufacturers, are forming a joint venture to develop
and manufacture high-speed diesel and natural gas engines.
Wartsila Diesel, the largest unit in the Metra group, is the world's leading
producer of medium-speed diesel engines. These are more powerful than the
high-speed engines made by Cummins, the world's largest producer in this
field.
'Through this venture Cummins will be moving up in their power range while
we will be at the lower end of our power range,' said Mr Ole Johansson,
senior vice-president of Wartsila Diesel International.
Two new families of engines up to 3,600hp and 6,000hp respectively will be
produced by the joint venture. The idea is to combine Wartsila's design with
Cummins' distribution capability to lift volumes and reduce costs.
The initial collaboration will be based on the Wartsila 200 engine, a
newly-launched product primarily aimed at the marine and power generation
markets.
Production will begin at Wartsila's SACM Diesel Factory in Mulhouse, France.
The second engine family will be a new 4.5 litre per cylinder engine.
Production is due to start in 1996.
