FT  19 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Indonesia in a bind over foreign
investment policy - Less-than-clear rules, says William Keeling, means much
may still have to be decided in a back room


   By WILLIAM KEELING


INDONESIA'S investment policy has been through a mangle, squeezed between
the government technocrats who champion deregulation and the large business
groups who profit from central decision-making. At issue is the state's role
in the financing of large-scale projects: nearly Dollars 80bn-worth has been
queueing up for approval.
The government set a ceiling in October on new foreign borrowing for state
and private banks, state enterprises and private companies, and Bank
Indonesia, the central bank. It also announced a timetable for 14
large-scale projects to proceed between 1991 and 1996, while four
petrochemical projects were indefinitely postponed. A further 94 projects,
in areas as diverse as wood pulp, mining and telecommunications, were to be
reviewed.
The decision was in response to a burgeoning private and public
international debt, which increased 44 per cent to Dollars 75bn in three
years, and concern over a current account deficit of Dollars 4.3bn in 1991.
But as one Jakarta banker said: 'In Indonesia, a government decision is seen
as an invitation to negotiate.' A series of intense backroom negotiations
followed.
In April, the government Asri plant, one of the postponed petrochemical
projects, would go ahead. This came as little surprise: Bank Bumi Daya, a
state-owned bank, had already provided the project a Dollars 550m line of
credit; the project's backers included the Bimantara Citra conglomerate,
headed by President Suharto's second son, and Mr Prajogo Pangestu, a leading
Indonesian businessman and close associate of senior politicians.
But approval was given with provisos: the project had to be wholly
foreign-owned - a first for a company outside a bonded zone (where companies
must export production); the project had to be scaled down from Dollars
2.25bn to Dollars 1.6bn, and Bank Bumi Daya's irrevocable letter of credit
would be transformed into a short-term bridging loan. It is unclear how the
Indonesian backers will meet these criteria.
Last month, the government announced that the rule on 100 per cent foreign
ownership was not exclusive to Chandra Asri. Full foreign ownership is now
allowed for companies investing more than Dollars 50m in projects in the
highly-populated provinces of Java and Sumatra, while those with lower
investment must be based in the more remote provinces. Previously, foreign
companies had been allowed 95 per cent ownership of joint ventures which
were export-orientated; their equity had to be reduced to 49 per cent within
15 years.
The decision has been an important deregulatory step, but some economists
believe it provides a loophole to by-pass the ceiling on foreign borrowings
 -which applies only to domestic institutions and enterprises - and may
worsen the current account deficit.
Government officials say loans raised offshore to finance wholly
foreign-owned ventures will not count as Indonesian debt, although they
accept that servicing such loans will have the same affect on the balance of
payments as foreign loans raised by domestic companies. Economists are
concerned that a shadow debt, not recognised by government but nevertheless
serviced by the country's export earnings, will grow.
Indeed, there is concern that the ceilings on foreign borrowing set last
year are already being broken. Private banks have supplied Bank Indonesia
with details of foreign loans but have not been given individual limits or
told if they are collectively within the ceiling.
Economists say that the central bank is reluctant to enforce the ruling
because this would be tantamount to a foreign exchange control. One minister
conceded: 'Bank Indonesia has suggested to us that perhaps the (private
bank) ceiling may have to be raised.'
The ceilings on all five categories may have been unnecessarily tight, with
one economist saying that even World Bank officials felt that the ceiling
limits were being overdone.
The government appears to have adopted a loose interpretation of the limits:
it estimates, for instance, that the eight projects scheduled for 1992-94,
which include two units at the Paiton electrical power complex in East Java,
have a total value of Dollars 2.2bn.
Yet officials at the government's Investment Co-ordinating Board say that
the Paiton units alone have investment approval of Dollars 2.2bn, although
this sum may include money raised locally. Other projects tabled for the
period include a Dollars 440m gas pipeline and an outer ring road for
Jakarta.
Industry officials also say that the Dollars 2.5bn Exor-1 refinery project
in West Java, not on the government's list of approved projects, will now go
ahead, as will the Dollars 200m upgrading of the Balikpapan refinery in East
Kalimantan.
Likely to be approved under the 100 per cent foreign ownership rule is
Exor-3, a Dollars 1bn project to refine crude oil for export which a
joint-venture of BP and C Itoh is studying.
Government officials say that a further 11 refinery and petrochemical
projects worth Dollars 18.6bn remain 'on hold,' and Dr Radius Prawiro,
senior economics minister, insists that the days of government funding for
mega-projects are numbered. 'We will curb foreign borrowing. We are not
going to finance big projects,' he says.
