FT  25 AUG 92 / W Saharan referendum plan fails


   By MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS AT THE UNITED NATIONS, New York


UNITED NATIONS attempts to promote a referendum on the future of the former
Spanish territory of Western Sahara have again failed and the settlement
plan, in which this is a key element, may have to be revised or abandoned.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, told the Security
Council in a written report yesterday that without tangible results in
further talks in the next few weeks he must conclude that the disputing
parties were unwilling to co-operate in implementation.
These parties are Morocco, which claims sovereignty, and the Polisario
nationalist movement, seeking an independent Western Sahara.
Under the UN plan a referendum was to have been held last January, four
months after a ceasefire went into effect. But the parties have been
unwilling to agree on who should be eligible to vote.
UN troops are on duty in Western Sahara for peacekeeping during the process,
but in smaller strength than was envisaged - because of the difficulties
that have arisen.
Mr Sahabzada Yakub-Khan, the former Pakistani foreign minister who is the
new UN mediator, was due to begin a further round of talks yesterday with
the two sides.
In a minor breakthrough, he has obtained their agreement, as a
confidence-building measure, to focus on safeguarding the rights, political
and otherwise, of whichever side is defeated in a referendum.
