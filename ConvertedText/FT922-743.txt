FT  26 JUN 92 / OECD Economic Outlook: Scant sign of real recovery in UK


   By PETER MARSH


'FEW signs of a sustained pick-up' are evident in Britain, the OECD warned
yesterday.
It said Britain's economy would grow much more slowly this year than
envisaged six months ago and at less than a third of the rate projected for
other Group of Seven industrial nations. The expected recovery later this
year would be constrained by high unemployment, the weak housing market and
large debts.
The bleak message underlined how - even though Britain is not alone in the
G7 in experiencing economic slowdown - its difficulties are particularly
acute. It came two weeks before the G7 (the US, Japan, Germany, France,
Britain, Italy, and Canada) meets in Munich to discuss the world economy.
The OECD's estimate that UK output will expand this year by 0.4 per cent
contrasts with its 2.2 per cent projection last December.
It is also substantially lower than forecasts for the other G7 members. Of
these, the next most laggardly in 1992 is expected to be Germany, which,
according to OECD predictions covering only the western part of the country,
will see growth of 1.3 per cent. The OECD puts overall G7 growth this year
at 1.8 per cent.
The UK Treasury said the OECD's estimate was 'not endorsed' by Britain. But
in an internal exercise, the Treasury is almost certainly revising downwards
its last published forecast of 1 per cent, made in the March budget.
The OECD thinks a hesitant UK recovery is probably starting about now, after
the recession touched bottom in the first quarter. But an increase in
business investment, which has fallen sharply during the longest economic
decline since the 1940s, is unlikely before late in the year.
Company profitability (as measured by the rate of return on capital) is
likely to be 9.9 per cent this year against 15.3 per cent for the whole of
the G7. Next year, the figures are expected to be 10.8 per cent and 15.7 per
cent respectively.
As for 1993, the OECD thinks UK output will expand by 2.6 per cent, compared
with 3.1 per cent for the G7.
But amid the gloom, the OECD sees some hopeful signs:
Private-sector wage settlements have dropped rapidly, enhancing
international competitiveness. Given projected good growth in world trade,
that should give UK exports 'an element of strength'.
Underlying inflation as measured by growth in the statistical deflators for
personal consumption could be as low as 3 per cent in 1993, 'creating the
conditions for a recovery in business investment'.
Removal of political uncertainty after the April general election has
'significantly increased' the probability of economic recovery by boosting
business and consumer confidence.
Higher public spending, at least partly caused by the recession, should
boost economic activity generally.
Over the longer term, the report says a critical issue is whether government
policies in areas such as training 'have boosted UK competitiveness
sufficiently to realise a better medium-term growth, employment and
inflation performance'.
