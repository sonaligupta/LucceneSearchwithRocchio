FT  30 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Time running out for Greycoat rescue
architects


   By RICHARD GOURLAY


EFFORTS to construct a financial package to save Greycoat, the ailing
property company, from liquidation are taking longer than the architects of
the rescue, Mr Julian Tregor and Mr Bryan Myerson, had expected.
Greycoat and its advisers have only one full working week before passing a
30-day deadline within which it is required to rectify a breach of the
gearing covenant on the zero bonds. Trustees for bondholders would then have
to consider whether to issue default notices.
The two corporate financiers, who advise the UK Active Value Fund, said they
were arranging a rescue shortly after share and bondholders rejected
proposals for a Pounds 120m rescue package from Postel, the UK's largest
pension fund.
