FT  22 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Hill & Smith ahead to Pounds 1.74m


   By GRAHAM DELLER


Hill & Smith Holdings, the West Midlands-based building products and steel
fabrications company, announced a 17 per cent expansion in interim profits
as it built upon a steady showing in the first quarter.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to March 31 amounted to Pounds 1.74m,
against Pounds 1.48m. Sales advanced by a commensurate amount to Pounds
36.7m, an improvement that took place wholly in the second quarter,
according to Mr John Silk, chairman.
The turnover advance, however, led to the figure for debtors rising to
Pounds 23.8m at the period end, up from Pounds 18.1m at September 30. This,
coupled with the decision to buy forward in steel and zinc, saw gearing rise
from 16.5 per cent to 34 per cent during the same period, although it had
since fallen, Mr Silk said.
Building products for the housing sector and manhole covers for the
communications industry benefited from increased activity to show
'significant improvements' in profits, he added, although better margins in
drainage products in the UK were partly offset by reduced sales in France.
Increased volumes helped the steel stockholding side to swing into a modest
profit, while the barrier and fencing operation maintained margins despite
declining demand. Forging failed to show any improvement on its previous
showing in spite of a 'reasonable order book', Mr Silk said.
The interim dividend is 2.1p, an effective increase of 10 per cent following
the 1-for-10 scrip issue in March, covered 1.67 times by earnings of 3.51p
(2.99p) per share.
