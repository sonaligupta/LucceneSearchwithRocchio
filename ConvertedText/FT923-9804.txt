FT  03 AUG 92 / European Bonds: Doubts about Maastricht Treaty trouble the
markets


   By SARA WEBB


EUROPE'S government bond markets have had a terrible summer, tumbling to the
bottom of the performance tables in June and July. Concern about the future
of the Maastricht Treaty on economic and monetary union, and worries that
the Bundesbank intends to keep German interest rates high for the rest of
this year have troubled the markets in recent weeks, and these factors are
likely to dominate the bond markets in the foreseeable future.
The Italian, Ecu, Spanish and French markets were the worst performers in
July with losses of 3.53 per cent, 2.36 per cent, 1.98 per cent and 1.23 per
cent respectively in local currency terms, according to Kemper Investment
Management. Meanwhile, the dollar bloc and Japan gave the best returns in
local currency terms, helped by lower interest rates. The Canadian
government bond market gained 4.87 per cent, followed by Australia (3.87 per
cent), New Zealand (3.6 per cent), US (2.78 per cent) and Japan (2.67 per
cent).
The European markets - particularly the high-yielding ones - were thrown
into chaos after Denmark rejected the Maastricht Treaty. Now, they are
focusing on the French referendum on September 20.
Last week, French bonds tumbled on fears that the next opinion polls would
show growing disenchantment with European economic and monetary union.
Unemployment continues to rise, doing little for the popularity of the
government, which is keen to secure a yes vote.
A French vote against Maastricht would not help the Italian and Spanish
governments to stick to their convergence policies, although Italy is
preoccupied with its own political problems. The resignation of the Italian
foreign minister last week appeared to undermine the credibility of the
month-old government and came as a shock to the Italian government bond
market - which suffered a sharp setback.
