FT  23 JUL 93 / International Capital Markets: China names bond dealers


   By REUTER


   BEIJING


CHINA has appointed 19 banks and securities underwriters to be the country's
first treasury bond primary dealers, Reuter reports from Beijing.
The move formalises a system which officials hope will eventually dominate
government bond issuance in China and is part of a key reform to eliminate
the forced sale of treasury bonds.
The 19 firms, led by the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, will be
the primary marketers of this year's Yn2bn issue of treasury bonds.
The issue, part of this year's overall Yn30bn of treasury issues, marks an
advance in China's efforts to develop Western-style controls over its
rapidly-evolving financial system.
Officials said primary dealers would be obliged to 'maintain normal
operations' in the still-informal secondary market by increasing liquidity.
