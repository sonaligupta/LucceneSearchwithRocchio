FT  29 APR 94 / UK Company News: RTZ in cut-price deal for Colowyo


   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent


RTZ Corporation of the UK, which in the past year became the fifth-largest
coal producer in the US, is now to buy most of the Colowyo Coal Company from
WR Grace, the US speciality chemicals group.
The deal is worth Dollars 233m (Pounds 160m) to Grace but will cost RTZ only
Dollars 13m cash.
RTZ will not buy an interest in some long-term coal contracts. Instead,
these will be used to secure a proposed non-recourse financing which will
give Grace Dollars 220m prior to completion of the deal.
Grace will also retain a limited partnership interest in Colowyo entitling
it to share in proceeds from those coal contracts.
Colowyo is a surface mine located in north-west Colorado, producing about 4m
tonnes a year of low-sulphur, high-energy coal. About 60 per cent of output
will be used to repay the financing but RTZ will get some benefit because it
will sell the coal to Grace for re-sale. Present leased reserves total about
180m tonnes of mineable coal of which 60m tonnes are committed to long-term
contracts.
Early last year RTZ took its first step into the US coal business when its
Kennecott subsidiary bought the Nerco company from PacificCorp and quickly
followed up with the purchase of Cordero from the Sun Company. These deals
cost RTZ Dollars 475m net.
RTZ said Colowyo would add a higher energy coal to Kennecott's portfolio,
enabling it to offer a broader range of products. After completion of the
deal, scheduled for June, Kennecott's annual coal output will be 35m tonnes.
