FT  17 JAN 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market report


   By REUTERS


Silver closed at the highest level for six months on the London bullion
market after a further strong technical rally on Comex. Sustained commission
house and fund chart-based buying on Comex pushed silver through key
resistance points at 420 and 425 cents a troy ounce, easily absorbing heavy
Middle East selling, dealers said. Analysts said the rally had also been
fuelled by sentiment that the US economy is recovering, potentially boosting
demand for silver, now widely viewed as an industrial metal. Silver's rise
inspired an advance in the London gold market, but stiff technical
resistance was hit at Dollars 357 a troy ounce, which attracted producer
selling. Platinum also closed higher in London. Nymex platinum futures were
ahead at midday, helped by news that South Africa's Impala had said that
some expansion plans are threatened by low metal prices and labour
disruptions. London cocoa prices closed ahead as sentiment was boosted by
the 10.8 per cent rise in UK fourth-quarter grind figures. Cumulative Ivory
Coast arrivals were reported to be more than 450,000 tonnes by the end of
last week but are expected to begin falling away. Chicago wheat prices were
again higher at midday, with traders reluctant to sell.
