FT  05 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Cupid's cash call flops


   By JANE FULLER


MORE THAN 80 per cent of the shares in Cupid's 1-for-2 rights issue were
left at the altar for the sub-underwriters to pick up.
The USM-quoted bridal wear company, which includes the Pronuptia retail
business, announced yesterday that 18.1 per cent of the 82p-a-share issue
had been taken up.
Mr Mike Murray, chief executive, said the result was disappointing, but it
came against the background of a falling market between the June launch and
the closing date.
Cupid's share price closed down 2p at 79p yesterday. On the day the Pounds
2.68m issue was announced it shed 5p to finish at 90p.
Mr Murray said the money was raised to finance retrospectively last winter's
purchase of the Youngs formal wear business from the receiver. That had
pushed up borrowings to Pounds 4.2m - gearing of 93 per cent.
The issue proceeds would wipe out debt during the current favourable period
for cash. Gearing would rise to about 24 per cent by the seasonal low in
December. That would leave the group scope to expand its nursery accessories
business into the 'hardware' side of cots and prams.
The issue was underwritten by BZW and sub-underwriters included Clerical
Medical & General and South Yorkshire Pension Fund.
Last year Cupid made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 982,000 on turnover of
Pounds 14.7m.
