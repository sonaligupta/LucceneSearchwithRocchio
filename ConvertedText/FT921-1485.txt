FT  24 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: French retail chain lifts
profits estimate


   By REUTER


   PARIS


GALERIES Lafayette, the French stores group, said its parent company's net
profit rose to a provisional FFr177.2m (Dollars 31.6m) in 1991 from FFr84.8m
in 1990, Reuter reports from Paris.
The company said the net effect of acquisitions had depressed pre-tax
profits by FFr68.9m. Without these exceptional items, pre-tax profit would
be comparable with the 1990 level of FFr140.1m. Before amortisation of
goodwill incurred in the acquisition of Nouvelles Galeries, Galeries
Lafayette estimated its 1991 consolidated net profit, before minority
interests, at FFr300m. It put no figure on the goodwill. Attributable net
profit in 1991 was FFr144.4m.
