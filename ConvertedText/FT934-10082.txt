FT  08 NOV 93 / German capacity use falls further

CAPACITY utilisation in west German manufacturing industry declined again in
September, and may continue to fall until the end of the year, the Ifo
economic institute in Munich says in a report.
The September figure, according to Ifo's latest survey of German
enterprises, was an average of 78 per cent, against 78.4 per cent in June,
the date of the last survey.
The figures confirm a steady decline in capacity utilisation since December
1990, when it reached a peak of 90 per cent, coinciding with German
unification.
Hardest hit were investment goods manufacturers, where utilisation dropped
to just 75.4 per cent in September, compared with a healthier 82.6 per cent
for all consumer goods manufacturers.
The decline coincides with a slight recovery in overall demand, according to
the Ifo survey. However, the apparent contradiction is accounted for by the
fact that production potential actually increased during the period.
There was no change in the level of orders coming to manufacturing industry,
which remained at 2.5 months' production, the same as in June. That figure
means the prevailing negative assessment of the current state of order books
was unchanged, Ifo says.
There was overall a slightly greater level of scepticism about the prospects
for business in the coming months, although very little change in the
expectations for exports.
'A further decline in capacity utilisation, albeit gentler, cannot be
excluded.'
One sector to perform against the trend was the hard-hit engineering
industry, where utilisation actually recovered to 77.1 per cent, from a low
point of 76.2 per cent in June. The prospects for the coming months were
also reported to be slightly better, although the chances of significant
improvement in capacity utilisation over the next 12 months are still
regarded very pessimistically.
