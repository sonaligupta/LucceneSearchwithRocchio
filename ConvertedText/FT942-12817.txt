FT  28 APR 94 / Hungary media move


   By ASSOCIATED PRESS


   Budapest


The Hungarian government expanded its portfolio of media businesses by
buying back the venerable but loss-making Magyar Nemzet daily newspaper from
its French owner, the state news agency MTI reported yesterday. Hersant
Group subsidiary Hungarian Presse Participation sold its shares in the paper
for an undisclosed sum, but MTI estimated it at Ft400m (Pounds 2.63m). The
government is also assuming the paper's Ft800m debt and injecting a further
Ft200m to keep the paper afloat. In 1990, the government prevented Magyar
Nemzet's sale to the Swedish liberal newspaper Dagens Nyheter on political
grounds and finally settled on the conservative French concern.
