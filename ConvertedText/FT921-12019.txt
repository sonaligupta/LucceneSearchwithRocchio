FT  29 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Labour accuses government of negligence


   By RALPH ATKINS


Labour yesterday accused the government of 'culpable negligence' for not
enacting social security regulations which it said could have helped
pensioners hit by the collapse of the Maxwell empire.
Mr Michael Meacher, the party's social security spokesman, said parts of the
1990 Social Security Act, if implemented, would have saved many pensioners
and employees by creating a debt on the employer when pension schemes are
wound up.
Mr Tony Newton, social security secretary, last night rebuffed Labour's
claims. 'It is simply not the case that pensioners in these schemes will get
nothing or be left penniless,' he said.
'Under existing regulations if there are not sufficient assets to secure
what are called Guaranteed Minimum Pensions, the equivalent of Serps (State
Earnings-related Pensions Scheme) then those guaranteed minimum pensions can
be, and would be, underwritten by the government.'
