FT  29 OCT 93 / International Company News: Rhone-Poulenc plans to cut
dividend payment for 1993


   By JOHN RIDDING


RHONE-Poulenc, the French chemicals and pharmaceuticals group which is due
to be privatised within the next few weeks, plans to cut its dividend for
1993 and adopt a more conservative dividend policy over the medium term.
The company said that the percentage cut in the dividend for this year, to
be paid in 1994, is not expected to exceed the percentage decline in net
profits.
In an announcement last Sunday, Rhone-Poulenc indicated that net profits for
1993 would be about 30 per cent lower than the FFr1.52bn (Dollars 258m)
achieved in 1992.
Analysts in Paris forecast that the dividend for 1993 would be between FFr2
and FFr2.5, compared with the FFr3 per share paid last year, accounting for
a split of each share into four.
In the medium term, Rhone-Poulenc said its objective would be to reduce its
dividends to between 30 per cent and 35 per cent of earnings per share.
Market observers said they did not expect yesterday's announcement to affect
the privatisation issue. 'It is bad news, but we were expecting it' said Mr
Vincent Bazi, head of research at Barings Securities in Paris.
Mr Bazi said that Rhone-Poulenc was trying to present all its problems
before privatisation to avoid surprises and to bring the share price down to
a more attractive level for investors. Yesterday, shares in the group fell
FFr4 to FFr152.
Mr Jean-Rene Fourtou, the company's chairman, has said that the Paris stock
market has risen faster than warranted by the outlook for corporate
earnings.
Rhone-Poulenc is facing what Mr Fourtou has described as the most difficult
chemicals market since the second world war and depressed demand for fibres
and polymers.
The Rhone-Poulenc issue, which is expected to raise between FFr15bn and
FFr16bn, is aimed principally at individual investors. Of the 79.3m shares
to be sold, 47.6m will go to a public share offering for French and EC
citizens and there will be a placement of 31.7m shares for French and
international institutional investors.
