FT  26 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Danes face ruin as drought
continues


   By HILARY BARNES

SEVERAL THOUSAND Danish farmers appear to be facing ruin as a result of the
worst early-summer drought in living memory, writes Hilary Barnes in
Copenhagen.
Farmers in some areas began harvesting this week, a month earlier than
normal. In other areas they were ploughing back spring-sown crops, which
have been destroyed by the drought.
The national average grain yield 'as of today' is expected to decline by 20
per cent for winter grain and 25 per cent for spring grain, according to the
State Agricultural Advisory Centre. The spring rape and pea harvest will be
down by at least 35 per cent, while the yield from winter rape will be down
by 15-20 per cent.
Mr HAO Kjeldsen, president of the Agricultural Council (umbrella
organisation for all the main farmer's organisations) as appealed to the
industry's creditors not to panic and urged the government to work out a
form of drought aid which will not further increase farm debt.
The Minister for Agriculture, Mr Laurids Tornaes, said on Tuesday that he
was considering how to help the worst-hit groups of farmers.
The Advisory Centre's figures are averages, and yields in areas where there
are light, sandy soils, such as north and west Jutland, may fall by between
50 and 75 per cent generally, with some fields yielding nothing at all.
The 'as of today' outlook could worsen rapidly if there is no rain soon  -
and the forecast is for fine, sunny weather for the next week. The Danish
grain harvest totalled 9.6m tonnes in 1990 and 8.8m tonnes in 1991, while
the rape harvest is about 800,000 tonnes annually.
