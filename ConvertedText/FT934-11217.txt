FT  02 NOV 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Changing terms for
commercial agents - In a Nutshell


Businesses which use commercial agents have been giving them notice to avoid
the impact of European Community regulations.
The regulations, which cover the legal relationship between the parties and
come into effect on January 1, generally strengthen the position of agents.
In particular they provide for compensation where an agreement is terminated
by the principal other than for breach of contract (for fuller discussion
see FT Growing Business page, 27 July).
Stephen Sidkin, of London solicitors Fox Williams, reports that some
manufacturers and suppliers are reappointing their agents as distributors or
franchisees, buying and selling goods for their own accounts. Others are
offering them direct employment.
'In brief they are taking on liability as employers as opposed to facing the
quasi-employee benefits which agents will soon enjoy.'
The Department of Trade and Industry issued a draft compliance cost
assessment in September which estimated that annual compensation costs could
be anything between Pounds 5,000 and Pounds 80,000 per sales force.
Sidkin points out that unless the notice brings the contract to an end on or
before 31 December, companies will have to honour their existing terms as
well as comply with the new regulations.
