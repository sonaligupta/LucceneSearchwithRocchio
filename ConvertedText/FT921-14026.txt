FT  17 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Markheath Pounds 459,000 in red


   By JANE FULLER


MARKHEATH, the property group, incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 459,000 in
the six months to September 30 1991 and is cutting its interim dividend from
2p to 0.5p.
The group is 60 per cent owned by the Australian Adelaide Steamship Group
which is being refinanced.
Markheath's figures for the first half of last year, showing a pre-tax
profit of Pounds 6.6m, were not comparable because of the contribution from
Camford Engineering, a motor components company which has since been sold.
That sale, completed in May 1991, helped to cut debt from Pounds 95m in
March to Pounds 62m in September. Mr Paul Bobroff, managing director, said
it had gone up by about 10 per cent since then because of a purchase and
dividend and tax payments.
Turnover plummeted to Pounds 3.8m (Pounds 74.5m) and mainly comprised the
sale of two properties previously owned by Camford. The loss, after paying
Pounds 1.05m interest, was Pounds 2.49m, offset by just over Pounds 2m
income from properties and dividends. Losses per share were 0.19p (earnings
of 3.59p).
Mr Bobroff said a further Pounds 2.6m of interest was capitalised. With
rental income of Pounds 2.8m this year and at least Pounds 3.7m next year,
the group was moving closer to a balance between rental income and total
finance costs.
'We are not selling property into a bad market and we are comfortable with
our portfolio, which is either completed tenanted buildings or development
sites. We have no developments in progress.'
The main opportunity for the group remained in Kings Park, Stevenage, a
22-acre site. About Pounds 1.5m was being spent on infrastructure work and
discussion were taking place with international companies to pre-let
substantial parts of the development.
