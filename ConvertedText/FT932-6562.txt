FT  27 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Falling bond yields lift Dow
to record high

Wall Street
AFTER TRADING most of the day in a narrow range, US share prices pushed into
record territory late in the session after bond yields fell decisively back
through the 7 per cent level, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 23.53 stronger at
3,540.16, eclipsing the previous record close of 3,523.28 set a week ago.
The more broadly based Standard & Poor's 500 advanced 4.59 to 453.44, while
the American SE composite finished 3.06 higher at a record 437.13 and the
Nasdaq composite up 9.05 at 704.09. New York SE volume totalled 279m shares.
The markets opened with prices edging forward across the board in subdued
trading. Investor sentiment was affected by more bad news on the economy.
Analysts had been expecting durable goods orders to have risen by between 1
per cent and 1.5 per cent last month, but they were unchanged in April. The
figures suggested yet again that the economy is struggling to make headway
after its unsustainably strong final quarter of 1992.
Fortunately for equities, bond prices continued to climb, buoyed by the poor
economic data, falling metal and commodity prices, and a strong five-year
note auction. By late afternoon the benchmark 30-year government bond was up
a full point, and the yield was down to just above 6.9 per cent. The sharp
drop in yields spurred late buying of stocks.
Compaq forged ahead Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 59 1/2 after a senior executive
at the computer company made promising noises about second-quarter earnings
prospects.
Other big computer stocks also strengthened, IBM appreciating Dollars 2 3/8
to Dollars 52 3/4 , Digital Equipment Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 45 1/4 and
Hewlett-Packard Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 86 1/4 .
Conner Peripherals declined Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 12 in heavy trading
after the company warned that it might make an operating loss in the third
quarter.
Banking and motor issues were in strong demand. BankAmerica put on Dollars 1
at Dollars 45 3/8 , Chemical Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 39 1/4 and Chase
Manhattan Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 31 5/8 , while Chrysler climbed Dollars 1
to Dollars 44 3/8 and Ford Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 52 5/8 .
T2, boosted in recent days by speculation that a management-led group is
planning to take over the company, relinquished some of its gain yesterday
amid growing doubts about the deal. The stock retreated Dollars 1 7/8 to
Dollars 15.
On the Nasdaq market, Novell was a rare weak spot, falling Dollars 2 3/8 to
Dollars 29 7/8 in volume of 13m shares after two brokerage houses downgraded
the stock following disappointing quarterly results.
Canada
TORONTO closed with a mildly firmer bias after active trading. The TSE 300
index was up 5.3 at 3,865.2 and advances outnumbered declines by 383 to 321
after volume of 77.07m shares valued at CDollars 701m.
Among the sub-indices, eight of the 14 increased. Transportation climbed
2.87 per cent as Laidlaw 'B' rose CDollars  3/8 to CDollars 10 7/8 . The
gold shares sector fell 1.92 per cent.
Bank of Montreal, Bank of Nova Scotia and National Trustco reported higher
second-quarter earnings. Bank of Montreal firmed CDollars  1/8 to CDollars
26 3/8 and Scotiabank was unchanged at CDollars 25 5/8 , as was National
Trustco at CDollars 18 3/4.
