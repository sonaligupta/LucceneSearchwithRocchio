FT  22 JUL 93 / Letters To The Editor: Hopes of more road schemes being
abandoned


   From Mr ASHLEY D DEACON


Sir, Mr John Stewart, chairman of the Alliance Against Road-building
(Letters, July 14), is quite right: there is indeed a growing movement
calling for a shift in emphasis by the Department of Transport away from
road-building and a rethinking of the government's multi-billion pound roads
programme.
The Oxleas Wood decision has not only given that movement added momentum, it
has also encouraged those currently challenging DoT road-building proposals
at public inquiries. Speaking from personal experience, coming as it did in
the middle of a lengthy and gruelling cross-examination by counsel for the
DoT at the A36 Salisbury by-pass inquiry, the Oxleas Wood decision was an
enormous morale booster.
In the 'little man's' battle against the DoT's big guns, the Oxleas Wood
decision was only the latest in what, it is to be hoped, will be a
lengthening list of abandoned road schemes from a government that listens to
public opinion, recognises the financial constraints it faces, and is
politically astute enough to modify its policies accordingly.
