FT  16 MAR 94 / Construction orders show 30% increase


   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent


Construction orders won by contractors rose 30 per cent during the three
months to the end of January compared with the corresponding period 12
months earlier.
The figures published yesterday by the Department of the Environment show
that the upsurge in orders since the autumn has continued, providing further
evidence that the recession in the industry may be coming to an end.
The value of orders at constant 1990 prices during the latest three-month
period is the highest since April, May and June in 1989. Orders last year
rose almost 12 per cent to Pounds 22.84bn, adjusted to take account of
seasonal variations. This compared with a peak of Pounds 26.45bn in 1989.
Total orders in January of Pounds 2.17bn were 16 per cent higher than in the
same month in 1993, although Pounds 321m lower than in December.
Contractors say opportunities to tender for work have risen sharply, but
they remain perturbed by the low prices at which jobs are being won. These
leave little or no profit margin unless companies can claim substantial
extra payments to cover design and specification changes.
The department's figures show private-sector housing orders during the
latest three months 12 per cent higher than during the previous three months
and 45 per cent higher than in the corresponding period a year ago.
Infrastructure orders compiled on the same basis were 49 per cent and 46 per
cent higher. Private industrial orders were 30 per cent higher than a year
earlier.
