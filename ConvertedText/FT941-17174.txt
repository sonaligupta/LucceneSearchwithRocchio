FT  06 JAN 94 / Man dies in clash at Bhutto home


   By FARHAN BOKHARI


   ISLAMABAD


Police yesterday fired on supporters of Pakistan prime minister Ms Benazir
Bhutto's jailed brother who were demonstrating outside her family home in
the city of Larkana, writes Farhan Bokhari in Islamabad.
One man died and seven were injured.
The incident was the worst in the family tussle between Ms Bhutto and her
estranged brother, Murtaza, who is in prison on charges of sponsoring
anti-government terrorism during his 16 years of exile.
Mrs Nusrat Bhutto, their mother, was among the demonstrators when riot
police armed with teargas and assault rifles, opened fire to stop the
activists reaching the grave of her husband, Mr Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the
former prime minister hanged in 1979. Mr Murtaza Bhutto's supporters had
vowed to stop Ms Benazir Bhutto from reaching the site and offering prayers,
because they consider her brother to be the true heir to the family's
legacy.
