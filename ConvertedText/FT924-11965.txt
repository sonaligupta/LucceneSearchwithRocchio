FT  23 OCT 92 / UK warns Gibraltar on EC's regulations


   By TOM BURNS and ROBERT MAUTHNER


   MADRID, LONDON


THE UK Government has told Gibraltar that it must implement the European
Community's single market regulations even if they appear to undermine its
aspirations of becoming an international offshore financial services centre,
write Tom Burns in Madrid and Robert Mauthner in London.
Britain argues that, since Gibraltar is still a crown colony, albeit with
certain self-governing powers, it is the UK which is responsible for the
implementation of EC decisions. London has stressed that it is the UK
government which would be arraigned before the European Court if Gibraltar
failed to apply EC rules.
The Gibraltarians, however, do not see the problem in quite the same light
and, in tough discussions with British officials, have made clear their deep
reservations about applying some EC rules.
In addition to the longstanding fears among Gibraltar's 30,000 population
over Spain's claim to the colony, there is now concern over a possible
constitutional crisis should London and the EC try to enforce their views.
Mr Joe Bossano, Gibraltar's chief minister, warned this week that, if the
colony's economic progress was hampered by major differences with London,
the situation could become 'critical.'
Mr Bossano said that although no decision had yet been taken by London, the
issue has been brought to a head by Gibraltar's ambivalent status as a
dependency of an EC state.
