FT  15 JUN 93 / Turnover falls at third of law firms


   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent


MORE THAN a third of law firms in England and Wales have suffered a fall in
turnover in the past 12 months and almost half have seen profits fall,
Coopers & Lybrand, the accountancy firm, said yesterday.
A survey of 900 law firms shows an increasing gap between those performing
well and those performing badly. Coopers warns that firms with poor
financial management are at risk of going to the wall.
The survey found that 35 per cent of firms reported a decrease in turnover
in the past 12 months with 12 per cent suffering a fall of more than 10 per
cent.
Overall, 26 per cent suffered a decline in profitability of more than 10 per
cent. Firms in central London and the south-east were worst hit, with 73 per
cent of London firms and 57 per cent in the south-east reporting lower
profits. Only 15 per cent of London firms have increased profits. The
largest number reporting growth were in the north-west and north-east.
Two-thirds of firms in the survey bill fees of Pounds 250,000 or less per
partner a year and about one quarter bill between Pounds 250,000 and Pounds
500,000.
Three in 10 firms have a ratio of profits to fees of less than 20 per cent
with 20 per cent having a ratio of profits to fees of more than 30 per cent.
Coopers says the wide range of profitability is largely due to the varying
levels of control exercised by partners over staff and property costs.
Staff costs range from 40 per cent to 50 per cent of fees while property
costs range from less than 10 per cent to more than 15 per cent of fees.
A firm's size was irrelevant to its success. Although larger firms continued
to grow at a faster rate this was not reflected in a greater proportion of
larger firms showing increased profits.
Almost 50 per cent of firms expect to employ more staff next year and 72 per
cent expect increased profits. Mr Brian Woods Scawen, a senior partner of
Coopers, said: 'We think the optimism expressed by many of these firms about
their short-term prospects may be misplaced.'
