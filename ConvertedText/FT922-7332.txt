FT  19 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Footwear quota spells 'threat to trainers'


   By ANDREW HILL


   BRUSSELS


CONTROVERSIAL proposals to impose an EC-wide quota on imports of cheap
Chinese footwear could increase the cost of trainers for EC consumers,
manufacturers say.
Trade officials from the Twelve yesterday discussed a Commission proposal
for EC quotas in different categories of shoes, including the growing market
for trainers. They broke up without agreement, with a majority said to
favour the quota proposal. Britain, Germany and the Netherlands asked the
Commission to supply further economic justification for the measure for
their meeting this week.
Chinese officials are in Brussels to discuss the proposals. China might
suggest a voluntary agreement to restrain exports, but Brussels does not
seem to favour such deals.
Instead of scrapping quotas altogether, Brussels decided to press for
harmonised EC quotas in specific areas, assessed according to the value of
imports. Quotas will be abolished in other markets, such as waterproof
footwear.
