FT  25 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Water sector


Yesterday's statement by Ofwat on the non-core activities of the water
companies will have come as little surprise to the market. The regulator
signalled his intention to tighten the rules in early May, and licence
changes proposed yesterday contain nothing nasty in the fine print. However,
the episode underlines Mr Byatt's determination to be tough on
cross-subsidies. Detailed scrutiny of transfer pricing and the dividends
flowing between the water companies and subsidiaries certainly imply a
greater reporting burden. The nagging concern is that the changes mark the
start of a more restrictive attitude towards non-core expansion and hence
contain the seeds of future conflict.
