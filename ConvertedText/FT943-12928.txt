FT  22 JUL 94 / Economy forecast to grow by 3.1%


Oxford Economic Forecasting, the independent analysts, expects UK growth to
accelerate to 3.1 per cent next year from a forecast 2.8 per cent in 1994.
However, it expects the recovery to lose momentum and growth to be 2.7 per
cent in 1996 and 2.2 per cent in 1997.
The world economy is forecast to expand by more than 4 per cent this year,
almost double last year's rate, with growth rising to about 4.4 per cent in
1995.
The forecast reflects expectations of strong growth in the developing
countries, led by China. Europe's economic outlook has also improved,
according to the survey, reflecting stronger than anticipated exports and
business confidence so far this year.
