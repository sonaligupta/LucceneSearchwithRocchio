FT  29 APR 94 / Enterprise launches hostile bid for Lasmo: Combined oil and
gas group valued at more than Pounds 3bn

   LONDON


Enterprise Oil yesterday launched a Pounds 1.45bn (Dollars 2.1bn) hostile
takeover bid for UK rival explorer Lasmo. If successful, the offer would
bring together the UK's two largest independent oil and gas explorers into a
single group valued at more than Pounds 3bn.
The offer is the largest hostile bid in the UK since BTR's Pounds 1.47bn
offer for Hawker Siddeley in 1991. If Lasmo shareholders accept the
all-paper offer, the enlarged company would rank fourth among North Sea
explorers, after British Petroleum, Shell and Exxon.
Enterprise virtually ruled out any prospect of a cash sweetener. 'I do not
see any need for it,' said Mr Graham Hearne, chairman and chief executive.
The group's policy was to pay for big acquisitions with paper, he added.
Mr Hearne said Enterprise's strong cash generation over the next few years -
following the completion of the Nelson and Scott fields - would meet Lasmo's
need for funds to bring its exploration opportunities on stream. He rejected
suggestions that Lasmo's recent Pounds 219m rights issue was enough to fund
the loss-making company's future needs.
Lasmo, however, attacked the bid as a 'contrived paper offer . . . which
would dilute significant growth potential for shareholders'. Mr Joe Darby,
chief executive, said the combination of the two companies 'would add no
value for shareholders'.
Financial markets appeared initially to support his view. Enterprise's
shares closed down 21p at 425p, while Lasmo fell 5 1/2 p at 157p.
'This bid is good for neither Lasmo shareholders nor Enterprise
shareholders,' said Mr David Basham, a Kleinwort Benson oil analyst. 'By
1996, they will have to find 164m barrels every year just to keep their
reserve base stable.'
The offer comprises, for every 80 Lasmo shares:
27 Enterprise A shares which will convert to ordinary shares on 1997 and
will carry a 3p annual dividend between 1994 and 1997. This is equivalent to
the dividend which Lasmo indicated it would pay in those year when it
launched its recent rights issue, plus
12 Enterprise warrants exercisable between 1997 and 2001 at 407p.
Enterprise says this values Lasmo shares at 150p, based on the A share price
of 407p and a warrant price of 86p.
