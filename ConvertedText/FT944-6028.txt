   LONDON


The BBC World Service yesterday launched two new language services for
listeners in central Asia and the Caucasus. The first BBC programme services
in the Azeri and Uzbek languages, they are aimed at 60m people in eight
former Soviet republics and a further 20m in Iran and Afghanistan. The
service will broadcast for four hours a day with specially produced
programmes in Azeri, Uzbek and Russian. The rest of the schedule will be
made up from the existing Russian service and English language teaching
programmes.
The BBC hopes that the new central Asia service, broadcast by both
short-wave and satellite for re-transmission on local stations, will reach
2m people within the next two years.
