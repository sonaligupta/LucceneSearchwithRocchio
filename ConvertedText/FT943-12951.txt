FT  22 JUL 94 / World Trade News: US renews pressure on China over
intellectual piracy

The US yesterday renewed pressure on Beijing to open its markets and stamp
out technological piracy, ahead of a General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
meeting next week which is due to discuss the terms on which China would
re-join the body.
Ms Charlene Barshefsky, deputy US trade representative, said in Beijing that
China must open its markets wider to US services industries notably
insurance and telecommunications.
The US is also demanding that China crack down on abuse of intellectual
property rights, which US industries say currently costs them almost Dollars
1bn (Pounds 600m) annually.
Ms Barshefsky, who is in Beijing for negotiations with Ms Wu Yi, China's
foreign trade minister, is pressing China to close 26 factories which the US
says are using pirated technology to produce compact discs for export.
US officials have been concerned by the discovery of discs throughout
south-east Asia and in Canada. The factories can make up to 75m discs a
year, Ms Barshefsky said.
The US government last month gave China six months to enforce laws to
protect intellectual property such as trademarks and copyrights. Without
improvement, China faces US trade sanctions on Dollars 800m worth of
exports.
Ms Barshefsky said her talks with Ms Wu were 'constructive,' though progress
in opening up China to foreign goods was progressing slowly.
This week - after weeks of delay - the first shipment of US apples arrived
in Shanghai. Though Ms Barshefsky was pleased China was accepting more
foreign agricultural goods, she said it was 'unacceptable' that China was
importing apples from only one US state, Washington.
Ms Barshefsky also criticised recent statements by China that it plans to
offer a 'final' set of concessions, which were not open to further
negotiation, at next week's talks in Geneva on its application to re-join
Gatt. She said Beijing's approach was 'not productive' and 'a recipe
designed not to reach agreement'.
AP adds from Beijing: The Chinese cabinet has responded to US pressure by
agreeing to meet regularly to discuss intellectual property right
infringements, an official newspaper said yesterday.
The China Daily said the cabinet aimed to draw attention to infringements
and had called on state-run media to highlight them.
