FT  30 OCT 93 / Malaga council seeks debt help


   By TOM BURNS


   MADRID


THE CITY council of Malaga, the principal town on Spain's Costa del Sol, is
believed to be seeking government assistance to avoid defaulting on its
debts.
Malaga authorities were yesterday reported to be negotiating a refinancing
package with the central government to avert defaulting on principal of
Pta3.5bn (Pounds 17.5m), which is underwritten by Spain's leading corporate
lender, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya.
The city's problems highlight dangerously high borrowing levels of other
city councils in Spain, but do not appear to have had any effect on Spain's
public debt market, where Spanish long-term bonds yesterday outperformed
Italy's.
Seven major city councils, including Madrid and Barcelona but not Malaga,
held a meeting earlier this week to lobby the central government for tax
rebates to help meet their deficits. Barcelona, which staged the 1992
Olympic games, has the largest debt with a total of Pta241bn. Spain's city
councils owe a total of Pta2,200bn.
Deficits have risen steeply in all levels of government, but they have risen
most of all among local councils, many of which have borrowed heavily on the
capital markets.
'This is a big problem for the councils and it is not going to be easy for
them to place paper from now on - but it is not a problem for Spain's main
bond and equity market,' said Mr Robert Maxwell, a senior partner at Madrid
securities house Maxwell and Espinosa.
