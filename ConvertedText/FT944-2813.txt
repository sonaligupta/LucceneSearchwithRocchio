FT  15 DEC 94 / International Company News: EBRD backs sale of Polish state
bank


   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI


   WARSAW


The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has agreed to
support the Polish government's sale of the Krakow-based Bank Przemyslowo
Handlowy (BPH) with a standby share purchase agreement.
The EBRD has said it would purchase up to 30 per cent of the offer should
the government fail to place the shares. The public offer, which opened last
Monday and runs until January 12, puts 50.2 per cent of the bank's equity on
the market. It is Poland's largest privatisation this year, and is worth at
least 4,130bn zlotys (Dollars 170m).
The sale of BPH, one of Poland's largest banks and the fourth state-owned
bank to be privatised, compares with the 13,800bn zlotys in new share offers
and rights issues taken up by the domestic market in the first
three-quarters of the year.
Mr Krzysztof Kalicki, the deputy finance minister responsible for the sale,
was in London yesterday speaking to foreign investors, who are crucial to
the success of the sale. Morale is low among local small investors, who have
yet to absorb this year's losses following large falls on the stock market
since the spring.
The EBRD has said it would buy the shares at the minimum price of 700,000
zlotys, which gives the bank a price-earnings ratio of 3.8.
The sale of BPH, which had net profits of 1,649bn zlotys for the first nine
months of this year, was set by western governments as a condition of
granting Poland Dollars 600m.
