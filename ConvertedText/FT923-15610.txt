Japan's labour market showed signs of slackening in May in response to the
steep slowdown of the Japanese economy, although employment remained at high
levels, according to government statistics released yesterday, writes Steven
Butler from Tokyo.
Unemployment in Japan inched up by 0.1 per cent to a seasonally adjusted 2.1
per cent in May. The ratio of job offers to applicants, however, declined
from 1.17 to 1.14, according to the Labour Ministry, indicating a
considerable loosening of the labour market compared to March last year,
when the ratio stood at 1.47. In the manufacturing sector, employment fell
by 100,000 compared to April, when 20,000 jobs were lost, but there was an
increase of 580,000 jobs in the service sector.
Also yesterday, the Economic Planning Agency said its index of leading
indicators in April fell from 40.9 per cent to 18.2 per cent, pointing to
weak economic activity in the months ahead. The EPA report showed
across-the-board weakness of the economy, with the exception of the housing
sector.
