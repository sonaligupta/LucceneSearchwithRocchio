FT  20 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Carlisle returns to the black with Pounds
1m


Carlisle Group, which specialises in property services, achieved a turnround
from pre-tax losses of Pounds 337,000 to profits of Pounds 1m in the half
year to June 30. For the full 1993 year there were losses of Pounds 2.86m.
Turnover improved to Pounds 2.87m (Pounds 1.96m) including Pounds 435,000
(Pounds 238,000) from investment activities.
The principal subsidiary, Pepper Angliss & Yarwood, the surveyors, had a
good first half, Mr Nigel Wray, chairman, said, and contributed profits of
Pounds 195,000 compared with losses of Pounds 433,000. The turnround had
been partly because of 'difficult rationalisation decisions'.
Mr Wray added that the group had a solid balance sheet with substantial cash
resources and no debt.
Earnings per share worked through at 1.2p (0.8p losses) and an interim
dividend of 0.25p is declared.
