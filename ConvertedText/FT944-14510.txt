FT  22 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Sphere board recommends bid rejection


   By BETHAN HUTTON


The board of Sphere Investment Trust yesterday advised shareholders not to
accept an offer from Dartmoor Investment Trust.
It recommended retaining the shares, or selling them in the market. Warrant
holders were advised to accept a separate offer for their warrants.
Dartmoor is offering eight new income shares for every 25 Sphere income and
residual capital shares. It has received provisional acceptances for more
than 52 per cent of the shares, held by itself, its managers, Exeter, and
Abtrust Fund Managers.
Sphere's board said it did not believe this was a fair or reasonable offer
for the shares, but acknowledged it was likely that the bid would become
unconditional.
Its recommendation was based on assurances from Dartmoor that Sphere would
continue as a separately quoted trust, retaining the same managers, with a
broadly equivalent portfolio to the past, until it was liquidated as
scheduled, or rolled over into a successor trust.
