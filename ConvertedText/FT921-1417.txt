FT  24 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Postal vote victory claimed


LABOUR claimed victory in the race for the postal vote as registration
closed yesterday.
More than 20,000 students supporting Labour have registered to vote by post
in marginal constituencies where they study, according to the National
Organisation of Labour Students. The Conservatives said they had no figures
for Tory postal voters as campaigns to register them are organised locally.
