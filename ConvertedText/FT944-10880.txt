FT  09 NOV 94 / World Trade News: ILO links trade and labour


   By FRANCES WILLIAMS

The International Labour Organisation should pursue the possibility of
incorporating certain basic labour standards in international fair trade
rules, according to a secretariat paper for discussion by the ILO's
governing body next week.
The paper suggests incorporating some ILO conventions relating to trade
union rights and prohibition of forced labour in the rules of the new World
Trade Organisation. The ILO would judge whether violations had occurred,
leaving the WTO to take decisions on trade sanctions.
Trade liberalisation 'at the very least' calls for recognition of conditions
'enabling workers to negotiate freely, both individually and collectively,
their conditions of work', says the paper. However, it rejects the notion of
equalising levels of wages and social protection across countries. If
approved, the proposal may give new life to the currently stalled debate on
linking trade and labour rights, strongly backed by the US but bitterly
opposed by many developing countries.
