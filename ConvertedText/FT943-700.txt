FT  28 SEP 94 / People: Bensons Crisps


Bensons Crisps announced yesterday that Tony Fiddian, its finance director
since 1985, had left the company for undisclosed reasons and his successor
would be appointed in due course.
Malcolm Jones, the chairman, said he was prevented by confidentiality
clauses from giving further details.
The Preston-based company, which completed a big capital spending programme
this year to lower manufacturing and storage costs, recently reported an
interim pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.69m against a loss of Pounds 386,000 a year
earlier.
Like other crisp and snack-makers, it is suffering from a vicious price war
in supermarkets caused in part by excess manufacturing capacity. And there
is no relief in sight, according to Jones.
Certain varieties of potatoes have been in short supply. Bensons has fixed
price-scale supply contracts running to next June covering about 90 to 95
per cent of its output, Jones says. But margins are so thin that other cost
increases would have to be passed on.
