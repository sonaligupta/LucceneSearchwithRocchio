   PRAGUE


AEG, the subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, is poised to acquire a majority stake
in the transport division of Czechoslovakia's CKD, writes Ariane Genillard
in Prague.
AEG intends to diversify CKD's production of tramcars and diesel electric
locomotives, and make subway cars, suburban trains and trolley buses.
Earlier this year Siemens acquired a 51 per cent stake in the transport
division of Skoda, the Plzen-based engineering group.
