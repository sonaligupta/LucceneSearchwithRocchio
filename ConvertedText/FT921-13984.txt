FT  18 JAN 92 / Shamir warns peace talks may be slowed


   By HUGH CARNEGY

MR Yitzhak Shamir, the Israeli prime minister, pledged yesterday to continue
Middle East peace talks despite the imminent collapse of his coalition
government. But he warned that progress in the negotiations might be
hampered during the expected prolonged election campaign.
Two extreme right-wing parties, Tehiya and Moledet, will tomorrow formally
resign from the coalition, led by Mr Shamir's Likud party, in protest
against the peace talks. Their departure will leave the government without a
parliamentary majority. Mr Shamir has indicated he will seek a general
election in May or June.
Mr Hans Van Der Broek, the Dutch foreign minister who is visiting Israel,
yesterday expressed to Mr Shamir what he called the world's concern that the
election should not be used to delay the peace process launched at the
Madrid Middle East Peace Conference last October. He said Mr Shamir had
assured him this would not be the case.
'The peace process will continue. For our part, we will try to proceed with
it as much as we can,' the prime minister said in a newspaper interview. But
he added: 'It is possible there will be certain restrictions because of the
special situation we are in.'
Mr Shamir, a sceptical participant from the start, will not mind if the
already tortuous negotiations slow because of the election.
But the Likud has made plain it intends to use its commitment to the peace
process as a central part of its election platform.
The stance is rich in irony, given the role Mr Shamir and his party have in
the past played in torpedoing peace initiatives, but it will pose a problem
for the opposition Labour party, which traditionally campaigns as the party
of peace.
There was no conirmation yesterday of reports that a hostage swap involving
Israel was imminent.
