FT  02 JUL 92 / UK Company News: AFE to mop up Cronite minority


AFE, the French engineering group, is compulsorily to acquire the remaining
shares in Cronite Group, after securing 91.6 per cent of the
Birmingham-based foundries company in its Pounds 7.3m recommended offer.
AFE announced yesterday that it owns or has received valid acceptances in
respect of 14.9m shares.
This comes some three weeks after Mr David Pinsent, alone on the Cronite
board in his opposition to the 45p per share offer, recommended shareholders
to accept AFE's bid when it went unconditional on May 27. This in turn
followed AFE's failure to speak for 50 per cent by the offer's first closing
date.
Yesterday Mr Pinsent, a former chairman of the company and now a
non-executive director said that another independent UK company had gone and
that he would resign 'in due course.'
