FT  02 JUL 92 / International Company News: South Africa to change control
of airports


   By DANIEL GREEN


SOUTH Africa is to take its Airports and air traffic services out of direct
government control and into two new companies.
Mr Piet Welgemoed, South Africa's transport minister, will today announce
the approval of proposals for the commercialisation of nine airports and air
traffic and navigation services, said Price Waterhouse, the London
accountancy firm which helped draw up the proposals, yesterday.
The South African government will remain the sole shareholder in the
companies but both will be run on a commercial basis. The government should
be able to phase out its subsidies, said Price Waterhouse.
The biggest of the airports, Jan Smuts at Johannesburg, handles about 12m
passengers a year, comparable with Geneva airport.
Eight other airports will also be affected, including those at Cape Town and
Durban.
South Africa is an increasingly popular destination for air traffic: over
the past year, 25 airlines which had not previously offered flights to the
country applied for access rights.
Legislation will have to be passed before the proposal can proceed. 'This
could happen by the spring of next year,' said Mr John Wright, who is head
of regulation and competition services at Price Waterhouse.
A regulation committee will be established by the South African government
for the two companies, but will not have authority to intervene in the
everyday running of their affairs.
Airports and air services are currently run as part of a government
department. Mr Wright said that the move was not a prelude to any
privatisation.
The proposals to run them on a more commercial basis have been drawn up
since June 1991.
