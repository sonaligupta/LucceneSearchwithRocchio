FT  02 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Azerbaijan in Caspian Sea oilfields deal


   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN


   ISTANBUL


AZERBAIJAN has agreed terms with a consortium of western oil companies to
develop oilfields in the Caspian Sea, in a contract worth more than Dollars
7bn (Pounds 4.6bn).
An official for the consortium, led by British Petroleum, Statoil of Norway
and the US companies Unocal, Pennzoil and Amoco, confirmed yesterday that an
agreement in principle had been signed in Baku to develop the Azeri and
Chirag fields.
The agreement was initialled by the team set up by the Azeri authorities and
the consortium members. It still has to be ratified by the Azeri parliament
and approved by the government, but it would appear to end months of
deadlock as the Azeri government of Mr Gaidar Aliyev sought to renegotiate
the contract terms. It is understood the consortium will split the proceeds
with the Azeri authorities on a 20:80 production-sharing basis, after
development and loan costs have been deducted. The larger share would go to
the Azeris.
The consortium is to pay the Azeris a signature bonus of Dollars 500m, half
paid when the agreement is ratified by parliament, the rest when an export
pipeline deal is finalised.
The two fields, which are expected to be in production by 1996, comprise
about 3bn barrels of known reserves.
The original negotiations included a third field at Gunashli, which is
already in production and operated by Socar, the state oil company. Gunashli
accounts for close to a third of Azerbaijan's current total output.
The latest deal will spur negotiations about a possible export route for the
oil. Turkey is urging Baku to use a proposed pipeline to its Mediterranean
coast, avoiding congestion in the Bosporus if the Black Sea route is chosen.
