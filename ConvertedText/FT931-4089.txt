FT  12 MAR 93 / Observer: Earl's summitry


The idea of putting a British woman on top of Everest and raising Pounds 1m
for Sir Edmund Hillary's Himalayan Trust deserves all the support it can
get.
But seasoned City types might wince a little at the news that the assault is
being organised by Peter Earl, the 37-year-old takeover artist, who used to
specialise in thinking up bids that rarely worked. Remember his masterpiece
 -Benlox's infamous Pounds 2bn bid for Storehouse in 1987?
In the interval, not very much has been heard of Earl, who was on the dole
for a while and lists surviving recessions and geriatric rowing among his
professions. As one less than benevolent wag remarked yesterday, it will be
lucky if the expedition gets as far as Nepal, let alone to the first Everest
base camp.
