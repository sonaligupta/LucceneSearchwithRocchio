FT  19 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: No hijack of Kent chambers


   From Mr JOHN CLARK


Sir, As a leading player in the East Kent Initiative, we congratulate you on
your representation of the situation in our part of the world (East Kent
survey, April 8). However, we feel the article headed 'Striking the right
balance' gives the wrong impression concerning chambers of commerce in Kent.
In effect the Kent Chamber of Commerce represents only six individual
chambers which in turn have a collective membership of some 1,300 businesses
 -not the 3,000 quoted. Our organisation, Associated Kent Chambers of
Commerce, comprises 1,800 businesses in the membership of seven chambers.
A merger between the two bodies has been agreed in principle and only when
this comes to fruition will the new organisation become one of the UK's
largest chambers.
By networking a series of local chambers, we believe we shall be delivering
a strong organisation to assist the development of Kent's businesses, to
represent their interests to government and, hopefully, through being truly
representative, be able to fight off what we see as government's attempt to
hijack the chambers of commerce movement through mergers with Training and
Enterprise Councils.
John Clark,
chief executive,
