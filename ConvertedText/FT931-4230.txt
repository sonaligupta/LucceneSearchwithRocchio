   By PAUL TAYLOR


A&J MUCKLOW Group, the property investor and developer, finally succumbed to
recessionary pressures in its first-half when profits fell 10 per cent from
Pounds 5.34m to Pounds 4.82m pre-tax.
Earnings per share in the six months to December 31 dipped to 3.26p (3.81p).
However, the interim dividend is raised to 2.963p (2.822p), equivalent to
half the total dividend paid in the latest full year.
Rental income rose to Pounds 7.85m (Pounds 7.33m) and the group recorded a
trading profit on house and land sales of Pounds 708,000 (Pounds 431,000)
producing an operating profit of Pounds 7.64m (Pounds 6.9m).
At the end of the period the group had net borrowings of Pounds 45.9m
(Pounds 32.8m), equivalent to gearing of 30 per cent, against 21 per cent a
year earlier.
Net asset value per share was little changed at 156p (159p).
