FT  23 NOV 92 / Chemicals group FFr3bn share sale imminent

RHONE-Poulenc, the French chemicals group, yesterday reported a fall in net
income only days before it is due to announce details of the sale of 10.6
per cent of the government's stake in the company.
Rhone-Poulenc's forthcoming share sale will raise between FFr3bn (Pounds
360m) and FFr4bn.
It will be a watershed in French industrial policy because it would be the
first time that France's socialist government allowed its holding in a
state-controlled company to fall below 50 per cent.
The group, the flagship of the French chemicals sector, suffered a modest
2.5 per cent fall in net income to FFr1.58bn from FFr1.62bn in the first
nine months of 1991.
The group managed to increase operating income by 23.5 per cent to FFr5.65bn
from FFr4.57bn on sales which rose by 0.7 per cent to FFr62.48bn from
FFr61.95bn.
Net income was hit by exchange rate fluctuations, although net income per
share increased by 6.6 per cent from FFr17.57 to FFr18.73.
The chief currency problem for Rhone-Poulenc was the US dollar's decline
against the French franc.
After the share sale, the state's direct voting rights will be reduced from
77.5 per cent to 45 per cent.
However the government will still exercise indirect control through stakes
owned by other state-controlled institutions, such as Credit Lyonnais bank
and Assurances Ge-nerales de France insurance group.
