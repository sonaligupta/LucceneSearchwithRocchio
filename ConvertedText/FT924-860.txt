FT  22 DEC 92 / Setback for EC hauliers


   By DAVID GARDNER


   BRUSSELS


EC transport ministers failed yesterday to agree measures which would have
given road haulage companies the right from next year to ply for trade in EC
countries other than their own, writes David Gardner in Brussels.
The measure is a basic building block of the internal market, which starts
on January 1, and hauliers facing cross-border barriers may now seek redress
through the European Court of Justice.
Germany was the main stumbling block to agreement. Bonn has linked a deal on
road cabotage to satisfactory agreements on road user charges, the fiscal
harmonisation of vehicle excise duties, and even travellers' duty-free
allowances.
EC diplomats were meeting last night to try to decouple from the cabotage
imbroglio those linked issues, such as travel allowances, on which a deal in
principle has been reached.
