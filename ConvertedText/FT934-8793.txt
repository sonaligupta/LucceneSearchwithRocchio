FT  13 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Poor ice cream sales check Unilever's rise


   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor


POOR ICE cream sales in Europe and severe competition in the North American
detergents market held Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch food and consumer products
group, to a 5 per cent rise in third quarter pre-tax profits from Pounds
584m to Pounds 613m.
Almost all of the rise was because of a buoyant performance by operations in
the rest of the world sector - particularly south-east Asia and Latin
America - which increased its operating profits by 20 per cent and sales by
27 per cent.
Operating profits in Europe - the sector which provided more than half of
Unilever's sales - fell slightly from Pounds 401m to Pounds 393m.
The directors said that economic conditions on the continent remained
difficult and that they saw only modest recovery in the UK.
However, they added that there were much clearer signs of improvement in
North America, where there was a small rise in operating profits from Pounds
99m to Pounds 103m.
Sales for the third quarter to September 30 were Pounds 6.64bn (Pounds
6.25bn). For the nine months, pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 1.6bn (Pounds
1.5bn) on sales of Pounds 19.33bn (Pounds 18.19bn).
Earnings per share rose 17 per cent to 21.94p (18.77p) in the quarter and 19
per cent to 58.32p (48.84p) for the nine months.
Mr Michael Perry, joint chairman, blamed the weak results from the Europe
division on poor weather during the peak sales season for ice cream. Sales
for the three months rose slightly to Pounds 3.78bn (Pounds 3.7bn).
He said the professional foods business also continued to experience weak
demand. However, most branded foods performed well, and personal products
made further good progress.
In North America the improvement was because of a strong performance in
personal products, both in the prestige and mass-market categories, the
directors stated.
However, the rest of the world sector again provided Unilever's strongest
growth, extending the trend in the first half. Operating profits rose to
Pounds 146m against Pounds 121m on sales of Pounds 457m (Pounds 360m).
Sales in Japan were growing at an annual rate of more than 20 per cent.
Unilever's overall operating margins slipped to 9.7 per cent (9.9 per cent)
in the quarter. Net debt rose to Pounds 1.5bn compared with Pounds 1.2bn.
The group made 24 acquisitions and 14 disposals during the quarter, at a net
cost of Pounds 450m. The interim dividend is raised to 6.08p (5.2p).
