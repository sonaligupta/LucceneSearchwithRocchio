FT  06 JAN 94 / Denmark cuts discount rate


   By REUTER


   COPENHAGEN


The Danish central bank, encouraged by economic prospects, yesterday
announced its ninth discount rate cut in five months, bringing the key rate
a quarter point lower to 6 per cent, Reuter reports from Copenhagen.
The bank also released data showing that its foreign currency reserves grew
by DKr9.3bn (Dollars 1.38bn) to DKr69.8bn at the end of December from the
previous month.
The krone has strengthened gradually from levels above DKr4.15 to the D-Mark
shortly after the suspension of the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) last
August to DKr3.88 yesterday, well within its former narrow ERM band.
