FT  12 MAR 92 / County Hall appeal is rejected


THE COURT of Appeal yesterday opened the way for the London School of
Economics to proceed with plans to move to County Hall, home of the former
Greater London Council.
It rejected an appeal by Lambeth council against planning consent for a
hotel and a residential and leisure complex. The council had said it would
not consider the LSE's plan until all legal action relating to the
alternative development of County Hall was over.
