FT  19 APR 94 / Calls grow for Haiti invasion


   By REUTER


   WASHINGTON


A second US congressman has raised the issue of an American military
invasion of Haiti, but only after first tightening sanctions against the
troubled Caribbean state, Reuter reports from Washington.
Senator John Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat, said on Sunday: 'I don't think
it is the first step, but it is certainly high on my list of options,
depending on what the scenario afterwards would be.'
Representative David Obey, a Wisconsin Democrat, said in a newspaper
interview last week that US forces should invade Haiti to remove its
military government, which ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide shortly
after he became Haiti's first democratically elected head of state. Mr
Aristide should then call for new internationally supervised elections, Mr
Kerry said.
The State Department had said that it would look at the call for an
invasion, but that Washington would meanwhile continue to pursue a
diplomatic solution.
The invasion calls came as Mr Aristide criticised US policy on Haiti and
urged Washington to increase sanctions against the military rulers.
He said during a visit to Berkeley, California, that he was unhappy with
President Bill Clinton's policy on Haiti, which he described as 'racist' and
'a clear violation of human rights'.
He condemned the US for forcibly repatriating Haitian refugees trying to
flee the island where, according to news reports, a new wave of political
terror has been launched against his supporters.
