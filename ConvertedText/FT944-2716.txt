Stocks moved up in active trading as institutional players returned to the
buy side, writes Robert Patton in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average gained 189.63 at 19,121.12, its first close above
19,000 in a week. It ranged from a low of 18,964.19 to a high of 19,177.54,
profit-takers cutting back some of the rise near the close.
Volume increased from 219.4m to an estimated 269m shares. The Topix index of
all first section stocks advanced 10.75 to 1,508.79 and the capital-weighted
Nikkei 300 added 2.29 at 279.08, while rises led falls by 694 to 275, with
198 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 3.45 at
1,261.60.
Futures-linked transactions were once again a factor in early trading, when
overnight gains in Chicago futures prompted arbitrageurs to purchase Tokyo
shares. Heavy buying by domestic financial institutions through Daiwa
Securities and Goldman Sachs also pushed up prices in the morning.
Life insurance companies continued to buy shares through domestic brokerage
houses. Their targets included Mitsui Marine and Fire Insurance, up Y15 at
Y742, and trading house Marubeni, ahead Y5 at Y530. Other trading companies
also advanced, Sumitomo adding Y15 at Y1,010 and Mitsubishi Y20 at Y1,300.
Boosted by a business daily report projecting a 32 per cent year-on-year
increase in consolidated pre-tax profits, automotive electronics parts maker
Nippondenso firmed Y10 to Y2,060. It is a major supplier to Toyota, Y10
higher at Y2,070.
Most other auto makers strengthened. Nissan moved up Y5 to Y810 in the day's
sixth highest volume of 3.6m shares. Honda gained Y20 at Y1,710, but Suzuki
Motor was off Y10 at Y2,110.
Privatised stocks were mixed. Japan Tobacco rose for the second straight
day, adding Y7,000 at Y914,000. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone gained Y7,000
at Y848,000, but East Japan Railway slipped Y2,000 to Y467,000.
Steelmakers advanced on active buying by investment trust fund managers.
Nippon Steel, the day's volume leader, climbed Y6 to Y363, Sumitomo Metal
Industries Y7 to Y315, Kawasaki Steel Y8 to Y405 and NKK Y4 to Y268.
Shipbuilders also firmed. Hitachi Zosen was up Y7 at Y532, Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries Y9 at Y723 and Kawasaki Heavy Industries Y5 at Y442.
In Osaka, the OSE average moved up 112.97 to 20,851.46 in volume of 148.5m
shares.
Roundup
The region was very active yesterday.
HONG KONG was lifted 3.2 per cent as both domestic and foreign investors
made selective purchases of blue chips. The Hang Seng index rose 262.21 to
8,259.56 in turnover of HKDollars 3.6bn, compared with HKDollars 3.8bn on
Wednesday.
Brokers said previously oversold property and banking stocks were the most
sought after. Swire Pacific 'A' led gainers, adding HKDollars 2.60 or 5.8
per cent at HKDollars 47.30.
Wing Lung Bank forged ahead 4.9 per cent to HKDollars 53, China Light 5.9
per cent to HKDollars 33.70 and Wharf 6.6 per cent to HKDollars 24.90.
The H-share index of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong was also pushed up,
jumping 73.32 or 7.3 per cent to 1,077.13. Brokers attributed the gain to a
technical rebound after being heavily oversold in the past few days.
SHANGHAI saw a contrasting performance between the A shares, available to
domestic investors, and the B shares, which are traded by foreign
institutions. While the B index closed 1.6 per cent down at a year's low of
59.998, the A index surged 7 per cent to 689.561.
Brokers put down weakness in the B index to the disappointing performance of
Shanghai New Asia Group, the hotel and restaurant concern which made its
debut this week. It fell 7.42 per cent from an issue price of Dollars 0.350.
Analysts said the New Asia listing had come at a time when some foreign
investors were repatriating funds following the recent round of rises in US
interest rates, and expectations that the US Federal Reserve would lift
rates again in the short term.
Regarding the interest in domestic stocks, Credit Lyonnais remarked that
this was a result of unconfirmed reports that the total share issue quota in
1995 would be reduced from Rmb5.5bn to Rmb2bn.
In Shenzhen, the A index gained 10.8 per cent at 152.49 and the B index fell
3.56 per cent to 89.90.
SYDNEY closed sharply higher, boosted by Wall Street's strong overnight
performance. The All Ordinaries index rose 31.2 or 1.7 per cent to 1,895.0
in turnover of ADollars 472m. Gains were concentrated in industrials.
The futures contract ended at a 14-point premium to the cash market, with a
rally of 2.1 per cent.
SINGAPORE rallied sharply on bargain hunting following recent losses. The
Straits Times Industrial index added 66.23 or 3.13 per cent at 2,180.23.
KUALA LUMPUR built on Wednesday's 4 per cent advance. The composite index
put on 13.62 or 1.45 per cent at 950.77, after hitting a high of 964.82 in
the morning. Profit-taking in the afternoon generally pared rises.
WELLINGTON gained momentum in the afternoon, helped by a rise in forestry
stocks. The NZSE-40 capital index firmed 10.5 to 1,906.22 in turnover of
NZDollars 54.7m.
