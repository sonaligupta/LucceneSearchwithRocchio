FT  30 JAN 92 / The Bush Budget: Proposals steer clear of details - Health
care


   By GEORGE GRAHAM


   WASHINGTON


PRESIDENT George Bush plans to put forward a comprehensive plan to reform
the US health care system next month, but in his State of the Union message
on Tuesday and in yesterday's budget he put forward only the bare outlines
of his scheme.
The plan aims to guarantee access to health care for all poor families
through a transferable health insurance voucher, which the administration
says will be large enough to buy basic coverage: Dollars 3,750 (Pounds
2,106) for a family.
Middle-class families, the administration says, will be allowed to deduct
more of their health care expenses. The administration also aims to solve
the problems small businesses are facing in obtaining affordable health
insurance for their employees by pooling arrangements to give them the same
buying power as large corporations.
Mr Bush explicitly rejected two of the reform proposals adopted by the
Democratic opposition: either a Canadian-style government-managed system or
the 'play or pay' system whereby companies would have to choose between
providing health coverage for employees or paying towards a state scheme.
He called for greater use of managed health plans, a streamlining in
paperwork and a reform of medical malpractice law as ways to control the
soaring cost of health care.
But critics said these measures appeared inadequate in the face of medical
inflation topping 10 per cent a year for the last five years.
The budget also includes Dollars 1.3bn in federal funding for primary and
preventive health care, including more money for community health centres
and for children's vaccination programmes; Dollars 99m for breast and
cervical cancer screening; and Dollars 565m for Aids treatment.
