FT  27 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Silver demand exceeds output in
1992

   WASHINGTON


WORLD SILVER demand outstripped production and other new supply in 1992 for
the third consecutive year.
The deficit may have begun to support prices, according Mr. Jeffery
Christian, who presented the fourth annual World Silver Survey to New York
analysts yesterday.
Published by the Washington-based Silver Institute, the survey was prepared
by the research firm CPM Group, of which Mr. Christian is a managing
director. Despite the bullish tone contributed by gradually rising demand
for silver, however, other fundamental factors - including large world
stocks - overhang the silver market.
Silver prices continued a decade-old decline in 1992 and silver extraction,
which is often a by-product of copper, zinc, and other mining failed to
respond to lower prices.
Total silver supply rose 1.8 per cent to 501.7 m ounces in 1992, while
silver use for fabricated products rose 2.0 per cent to 590.3m ounces, a gap
of 88.6m ounces. Supply gains came from a 1.3 per cent increase in mine
production, and a 3.0 per cent increase in secondary supplies.
A decline in silver use in the US, Japan, and other industrialised countries
last year was more than offset by rising demand in the countries of Asia,
particularly India.
The report projects fabricated silver demand to rise 5.9 per cent in 1993,
to 625.0m ounces and new supply to drop 4 per cent to 481.8m ounces.
Although secondary sources of silver will continue to increase this year,
the survey projects mine production, excluding countries with non-market
economies, to decline 6.3 per cent to 339.8m ounces.
Mine output in the US, Canada and Peru is forecast to fall, while Mexico,
the world's largest silver producer, is expected to continue production at
about 65m ounces this year.
While China was the biggest buyer of gold last year, ithas had little
influence on world silver statistics, Mr. Christian said.
