FT  05 AUG 93 / Continental slide and redundancy costs limit GKN


   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent


GKN, the automotive components, engineering and industrial services group,
achieved virtually unchanged pre-tax profits of Pounds 60m in the first half
of the year compared with Pounds 60.9m in the same period of last year.
It suffered heavy costs of Pounds 10.5m for redundancies and restructuring,
against Pounds 4.4m in the first half of 1992, as the worldwide workforce
was cut by about 1,000 to 27,500 - including 600 jobs eliminated in the UK.
Mr Trevor Bonner, managing director for GKN automotive operations, said
around 500 more jobs would be lost by the end of the year.
Sir David Lees, chairman and chief executive, warned that the group faced
'another tough trading period' in the second half.
GKN's automotive components operations account for about 58 per cent of
group turnover. This part of the business was hit by the steep decline in
car and commercial vehicle sales in continental Europe in the first half,
partly offset by stronger demand in North America and the UK.
Mr Bonner said that car production in Europe had fallen by 15.1 per cent in
the first six months to 6.23m, while commercial vehicle production had
plunged by 27.7 per cent to 700,000.
He warned that car and commercial vehicle sales in Europe would continue to
fall in the second half and that a recovery would not start 'before well
into 1994'.
On a more optimistic note, Sir David said negotiations were 'well advanced'
between the British and Kuwaiti governments for the sale of GKN armoured
combat vehicles to Kuwait. The sale of more than 200 Warrior tracked combat
vehicles and more than 100 Piranha light armoured vehicles worth 'not less
than Pounds 500m' was likely to be agreed shortly. Production was expected
to begin in late 1994 and would secure around 500 jobs in GKN's defence
operations at Telford, Shropshire, for the next four to five years.
Group turnover in the first six months rose by just over 10 per cent to
Pounds 1.39bn from Pounds 1.26bn. Operating profits from continuing
operations fell to Pounds 64m from Pounds 67m.
The contribution from continental Europe slid to Pounds 27m from Pounds 42m,
while profits from America nearly doubled to Pounds 13m and the UK rose to
Pounds 19m from Pounds 16m.
The divisional breakdown showed a Pounds 5m fall in profits to Pounds 48m in
automotive and engineered products, while industrial services and
distribution went up Pounds 2m to Pounds 16m.
Earnings per share rose to 9.8p, compared with 9.3p. The interim dividend is
unchanged at 8p.
