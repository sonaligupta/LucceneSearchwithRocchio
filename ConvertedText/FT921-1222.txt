FT  25 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei below 20,000 as
Bank fails to act


   By EMIKO TERAZONO


   TOKYO


SHARE PRICES turned down on broad-based selling yesterday, and the Nikkei
average once again fell below the 20,000 level on disappointment that the
Bank of Japan had failed to cut the official discount rate, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average was finally 348.03 down at 19,891.57 after opening at
the day's high of 20,199.52 and moving to the session's low of 19,866.32 in
the afternoon.
Volume increased slightly to 300m shares from 280m. Falls overwhelmed rises
by 800 to 198, with 149 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first
section stocks ended 20.33 weaker at 1,439.55, and in London the ISE/Nikkei
50 index dipped 4.09 to 1,119.53.
Heavy selling by companies ahead of the last trading session for March
accounts today pulled down share prices. Index-linked sales by arbitrageurs
also depressed the index, as low-liquidity component stocks of the Nikkei
lost ground.
Rumours that financial troubles at a Canadian real estate company would hit
Japanese banks added to the pessimism. Most market participants are now
hoping for an easing in monetary policy after Friday's announcement of the
government's economic stimulus package and industrial production figures for
February.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the benchmark for market sentiment, dropped
Y19,000 to set an all-time low of Y640,000. Other leading high-technology
issues also declined, with Sony shedding Y20 to Y4,080.
Small-capital component stocks of the Nikkei average fell sharply on concern
that the index may be restructured later this year, after financial
authorities complete their review. Daito Woollen Spinning and Weaving lost
Y210 to Y1,350 and Shinagawa Refractories Y120 to Y1,110.
Financial shares ran into selling by companies ahead of the March
book-closing, while banks were affected by market rumours. Industrial Bank
of Japan finished Y80 cheaper at Y2,360 and Nomura Securities Y30 off at
Y1,220.
Bio-technology issues were lower on profit-taking. Meiji Milk Products fell
Y25 to Y891 and Mochida Pharmaceutical Y90 to Y3,690. However, Nagase, a
chemical product trader, jumped Y38 to Y815 on rumours of a new Aids cure.
In Osaka, the OSE average declined 266.46 to 21,429.62 in volume of 613.9m
shares. The index fell on liquidation by tokkin - specified money trusts -
and investment trusts. Active cross-trading by companies ahead of book
closings for the current year to March pushed up activity.
Roundup
THE PACIFIC Rim put in a mixed performance yesterday. Seoul, closed for the
parliamentary election, reopens today.

per cent, to 4,790.10. Turnover was TDollars 20.6bn (TDollars 17.26bn).

pesos, down from 91m.
The market was also weighed down by the 3bn-peso share offering by
