FT  23 JUL 93 / International Company News: Texaco doubles second-term
profit


   By RICHARD WATERS


A RISE in natural gas prices in the US and a further improvement in refining
and marketing margins enabled Texaco to double net profit in the second
quarter compared with a depressed quarter last year.
But Mr Alfred McCrane, chairman, warned: 'The international petroleum
industry is faced with continuing uncertain world economic conditions, as
well as the oversupply of crude oil,' which has pushed oil prices down by
Dollars 3 a barrel since May.
He added that attention to controlling costs and other operational
improvements 'will be particularly important in the forward period'.
Post-tax profits reached Dollars 309m, or Dollars 1.10 a share, compared
with Dollars 151m, or 49 cents, a year ago. First-half net income was up
from Dollars 383m (before the effect of a Dollars 300m charge reflecting an
accounting change) to Dollars 587m.
second-quarter operating profits of Dollars 419m, up from Dollars 294m, were
bolstered by Dollars 163m from oil and gas exploration and production in the
US, up from Dollars 112m on the back of natural gas prices which recovered
from low 1992 levels.
Upstream activities abroad returned an operating profit of Dollars 82m,
against Dollars 46m, after benefiting from higher production in the Middle
East and Indonesia.
Refining and marketing operating profits fell from Dollars 77m to Dollars
63m in the US, reflecting 'excess supplies of refined products' on the US
east and Gulf coasts.
The international downstream operating result, aided by stronger margins in
Latin America, rose from Dollars 61m to Dollars 120m. Petrochemicals
suffered an operating loss of Dollars 7m (a Dollars 2m profit a year ago)
due to higher feedstock and energy costs. Lower interest costs and
cost-cutting reduced non-operating expenses by Dollars 53m to Dollars 210m.
Higher natural gas prices also boosted Occidental Petroleum, pushing
second-quarter net income to Dollars 75m, or 21 cents a share, up from
Dollars 50m, or 16 cents, in the same period of 1992. Net income for the
half year was Dollars 155m, against a loss of Dollars 87m last time when the
company took a Dollars 93m charge for an accounting change.
Second-quarter operating profits from oil and gas of Dollars 130m, up from
Dollars 79m, were boosted by Dollars 55m from a tax refund and disposal of a
stake in Trident NGL. In 1992, figures had been lifted by Dollars 35m from a
litigation settlement.
Amoco, the US oil and gas group, exceeded analysts' expectations with
second-quarter net income of Dollars 487m, or 98 cents a share, compared
with Dollars 216m, or 43 cents, before restructuring charges a year ago.
The figures were boosted by higher earnings from US exploration and
production, due mainly to higher gas prices, and an improvement in costs in
refining and marketing, said Mr Laurance Fuller, chairman.
Due to higher gas prices, operating profits from US exploration and
production rose to Dollars 293m before a Dollars 63m charge for
environmental clean-up costs, from Dollars 154m in the 1992 quarter. Lower
exploration costs and favourable exchange movements pushed operating profits
on foreign upstream activities to Dollars 53m, compared with a loss of
Dollars 27m a year ago.
First-half operating income was Dollars 830m, or Dollars 1.67 a share,
compared with Dollars 473m, or 95 cents, a year ago, before the effects in
1992 of charges related to restructuring and accounting changes.
