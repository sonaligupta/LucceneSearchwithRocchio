FT  22 AUG 92 / Briefcase, Q&A: Capital gains on US shares


I HAVE recently had share certificates from several US investments, which
were previously held on my behalf by overseas nominee banks, transferred
into my sole name in the UK.
As there will be seven quarterly dividends paid to me (28 a year) what is
the most efficient and economical way of processing these? Presenting them
at a bank incurs multiple commission and varying exchange rates.
Would it be possible to open an interest-bearing dollar account in this
country, if so how would UK tax be deducted and recorded? Would you be able
to suggest any American banks I could contact for this purpose?
If you pay the dividends into a dollar account in the UK, the bank will
deduct 10 per cent UK tax (or 25 per cent on dividends which are exempt from
US tax) by reference to the exchange rate for the day.
You may find it is more economical to have the dividends mandated to a bank
in the US. You could then have money sent over (in sterling) to you existing
UK bank account, at convenient intervals or as required.
We cannot recommend particular banks: it may be best to have a chat with
your existing bank.
Bear in mind that each withdrawal from a foreign-currency bank account
produces a chargeable gain or an allowable loss for CGT purposes. If you are
thinking of having more than one dollar bank account, write to the Inland
Revenue Public Enquiry Room, Somerset House, Strand, London, WC2R 1LB, and
ask for a copy of SP10/84 - Capital gains tax: foreign banks accounts.
