FT  06 AUG 93 / Observer: On its uppers


Guess what the Brazilian press focused on when Citicorp boss John Reed met
Itamar Franco, president of Brazil, the other day?
Perhaps it was too much to expect the Brazilians to highlight the recovering
fortunes of what used to be the world's premier international bank. Reed, as
president of Brazil's largest creditor bank, had thought his visit would
sharpen interest on negotiations over Brazil's Dollars 44bn commercial debt.
However, one of Brazil's eagle-eyed paparazzi spotted that Reed's well-worn
shoes had been repaired with rubber heels.
Quick as a flash, pictures of the offending footwear were splashed all over
yesterday's front-pages sparking a national debate over the importance of
being decently shod. Brazilian style-setters leapt to Reed's defence saying
his 'battered look' was just right for the difficult economic times of the
1990s. But the more serious journalists quickly homed in on the real
message. In a throwaway society, Reed was making a personal statement about
the need for austerity.
