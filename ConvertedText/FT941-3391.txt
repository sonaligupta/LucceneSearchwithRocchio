FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Lionheart back in black with Pounds 1.77m


   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY


Lionheart, the Cheshire-based paint brushes and housewares group, returned
to profit in 1993 with Pounds 1.77m pre-tax, a Pounds 2.64m turnround on
1992's deficit of Pounds 870,000. Mr Paul Lever, chairman, said an
acquisition was now likely within months, writes Ian Hamilton Fazey.
Turnover rose by 7 per cent to Pounds 46.7m (Pounds 43.6m), giving a
profit-to-sales ratio of 3.8 per cent. With earnings per share of 0.49p
(losses 0.59p) a final dividend of 0.2p is proposed making 0.3p (0.2p) for
the year.
The group returned to the dividend list only two years ago after
reconstruction under Mr Lever, the chairman and former chief executive of
Crown Paints.
Talks are understood to have begun about an acquisition with an announcement
in the first half of the current year.
