FT  20 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Hachette, Michelin fall after
1990 results


   By Our Markets Staff


BOURSES made a subdued end to a week which had its exciting moments, writes
Our Markets Staff.
PARIS followed the bond market lower on receding hopes of a cut in interest
rates. The CAC-40 index fell 24.62 to 1,791.12, down 1.7 per cent on the
week, in volume estimated at FFR1.8bn.
Hachette, the publishing group, was the day's biggest loser, falling
FFr11.20 or 5.23 per cent to FFr203.10 in volume of 43,600 shares. Dealers
said the share was under selling pressure following the publication of 1990
results this week.
Also on the way down was Michelin, the tyre manufacturer, which lost FFr3.30
or 3.7 per cent to FFr86 with 229,350 shares traded as investors focused on
its balance sheet problems. But Peugeot rose again, up FFr7 to FFr553 with
147,600 shares traded, on continued relief that the chairman's statements
were more positive than usual.
Alcatel was weaker for the second day, losing FFr11 to FFr578 with a heavy
380,980 shares traded. Dealers spoke of a large sell order from London.
FRANKFURT took profits, nervous ahead of tomorrow's elections in the
Rhineland-Palatinate, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's home state. However, as the
dollar closed at a new high for the year against the D-Mark, companies
especially dependent on US sales withstood the general decline.
After a fall of 6.95 to 677.60 in the FAZ index at midsession, the DAX
closed 14.39 lower at 1,599.37. Rises on the week were 0.8 and 1.0 per cent
respectively and volume yesterday tailed off to DM5.5bn, down from DM7bn.
Among the dollar stocks, chemcials were relatively strong and, in motors,
BMW rose DM6.50 to DM570.50, up DM20 over three days in response to buy
notes from a numnber of London broking houses. Among the many fallers,
Mannesmann's DM9 drop to DM286 followed a sell recommendation by James
Capel, on lower first quarter sales and problems in Brazil.
However, last night the D-Mark had fallen below Y80 to Yen79.70. At this
level, Japanese shareholders in German equities are expected to get worried
about the Yen value of their holdings and, perhaps, to hedge their bets.
ZURICH saw a curious juxtaposition. On Thursday Sandoz said it would open
its registered shares to foreigners and got the standard response, with the
registered up and the bearers down. Yesterday however, it was one-way
movement at the end with the registered up SFr550 to SFr11,575, the bearers
by SFr450 to SFr11,800, and the participation certificates by SFr40 to
SFr2,200.
Ms Sarah Lavers, head of research at Schroder Securities, said that, by
Thursday evening, the premium on the bearers had fallen below the 5 to 6 per
cent generally expected for the privilege of anonymity on the part of the
holder. She had recommended a purchase of the bearers. Meanwhile, the SBC
general index rose 2.0 to 621.4, fractionally down on the week.
MILAN was again lifted by the insurance sector. The Comit index rose 3.94 to
602.64, weakness. up 1.4 per cent on the week. Generali, in heavy volume, at
one point reached L38,750 though it was officially set L560 higher at
L38,500. Mediobanca, the merchant bank which has a stake of up to 8 per
cent, closed L650 up at L16,630. Other insurers, including Alleanza, Toro
and Ras, all continued to gain. Toro was L190 up at L27,340.
AMSTERDAM was dominated by the expiry of April series options. The CBS
tendency index, which hit two 1991 highs this week, fell 0.8 to 96.0, 0.2
per cent lower on the week.
BRUSSELS heard rumours that Societe Generale de Belgique would sell its
stake in the chemical concern Gechem, pushing Gechem shares up BFr36 or 4.8
per cent to BFr786. The Bel-20 index was down 0.58 to 1,210.83, up 0.4 per
cent on the week.
MADRID focused on the construction sector. Focsa closed Pta160 higher at
Pta14,910 on rumours that a merger with Valderrivas is in the offing. The
general index fell 1.48 to 282.43, up 0.5 per cent on the week in volume of
Pta12bn after Pta13.6bn.
