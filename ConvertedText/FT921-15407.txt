FT  10 JAN 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report


   By REUTER


THE GOLD price on the London bullion market yesterday continued the rally
sparked by the oversold situation reached in Monday's sharp dip to below
Dollars 350 a troy ounce. Dealers said the stronger tone was underpinned by
good physical demand as the price advanced Dollars 3.45 to Dollars 353.75 an
ounce at the close. And afterhours trading saw a further rise to Dollars 355
an ounce as dealers responded to early gains in the New York futures market,
prompted by heavy US investment fund and Middle Eastern buying. The platinum
market was also firm, in response to news of a strike at Impala's Bafokeng
North mine in South Africa. The price was fixed in the afternoon at Dollars
338.25 an ounce, up Dollars 2.65. Nervous short-covering continued to affect
the London Metal Exchange aluminium market, where the cash position closed
Dollars 11 up at Dollars 1,130.50 a tonne. But the rise had been trimmed as
a rise in the dollar dampened hopes of increased consumer demand. The firmer
dollar was a bullish factor for the sterling-denominated copper market,
where the cash position ended at Pounds 1,155 a tonne, up Pounds 30 on the
day. Traders noted, however, that when currency factors caused such big
movements it tended to make markets thin.
