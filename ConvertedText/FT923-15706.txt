FT  01 JUL 92 / People: A nuclear grasp of options pricing


Andrew Street (left), who holds a DPhil in theoretical nuclear physics from
Oxford University, is later this month joining Mitsubishi Finance
International as director and head of equity and commodity risk management.
Street, who was previously with Nomura International, heading equity
derivatives training, says his work on a neutron's path through the core of
a nuclear reactor is indeed a valuable aid to grasping options pricing
theory.
Mitsubishi Finance International, with noted derivatives academic Desmond
Fitzgerald as head of arbitrage, has been a leader in developing exotic
derivatives products such as average rate warrants and look-back options.
Street, in turn, has worked with Fitzgerald on a number of projects over the
past five years.
'I have been brought in to Mitsubishi to run the desk on a day-to-day basis,
leaving Desmond more time for the 'big picture' strategic view. He is wasted
on the desk,' says Street.
His reasons for leaving Nomura after 15 months?
'As a securities house, Nomura has not been a credit intermediary,' he
points out. By contrast Mitsubishi, as the sixth largest bank in the world,
can inhabit a strong position in a market where creditworthiness and a hefty
balance sheet is crucial.
