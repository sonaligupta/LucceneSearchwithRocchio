FT  24 AUG 92 / Letter: Authority of AGM is no panacea


   From Mr EDMOND JACKSON


Sir, I am sceptical that Dr Maurice Gillibrand's proposals (Letters, August
11) for legislation to restore the authority of annual general meetings or
to introduce two-tier boards are significant for competitiveness.
Corporate governance is no panacea. Japanese companies win because they
manufacture quality goods at a price that people want. Meanwhile, their AGMs
are, sometimes, arguably populated by gangsters.
If AGMs are given more power, minorities able to attend could force change
against the majority. Perhaps investors should find ways to exchange ideas
and exert constructive, on-going influence.
German practices do not simply import: two-tier boards will throw sand into
the Anglo-Saxon corporate machine. Let us preserve efficiency in the unitary
board until investors act more responsibly. 'Dividend-strippers' are as bad
as greedy directors.
