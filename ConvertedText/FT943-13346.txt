FT  20 JUL 94 / People: Ford takes a seat with London Transport


London Transport has finally found a chairman acceptable to the government
in the shape of Peter Ford, formerly a director of P&O Steam Navigation and
chairman of P&O European Ferries.
The man originally intended for the job, Alan Watkins, London Transport's
deputy chairman and chief, was blocked by the government because of his
sharply-worded criticisms of cuts in LT's budget.
The decision not to appoint Watkins prompted an angry response from within
LT and an expression of 'deep regret' from the retiring chairman, Sir
Wilfred Newton. Sir Wilfred was forced to stay on extra six months.
Ford, 55, takes up his new appointment on September 15 and will be
immediately pitched into the privatisation of London Buses, due to be
completed later this year. There is a strong possibility that once rail
privatisation is completed the government will look at selling off London
Underground, leaving London Transport with little to do.
During his time with P&O, Ford spent time in the group's shopping centres
and exhibitions divisions. He has a degree in chemistry from Oxford
University and an MBA from Harvard Business School.
Ford is regarded as one of the key lieutenants of Lord Sterling, chairman of
P&O. He was one of a small group of executives who followed Lord Sterling
around as he expanded out of the property business and took control of P&O.
Ford had been chairman of P&O European Ferries for just three weeks when the
ferry, the Herald of Free Enterprise, overturned with the loss of nearly 200
lives on leaving the harbour of Zeebrugge in March 1987.
