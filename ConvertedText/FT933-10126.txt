FT  05 AUG 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Sharp rise for French franc


   By JAMES BLITZ


THE French franc, Belgian franc and Danish krone all rose sharply against
the D-Mark in European trading yesterday as the central banks of all three
countries surprised currency dealers by keeping the overnight cost of
borrowing very high, writes James Blitz.
The rush out of D-Marks into these other currencies may have been partly due
to the Bundesbank's decision to cut its repo rates on Tuesday and yesterday.
But many dealers were clearly taken completely by surprise by the decision
of the three countries not to cut interest rates and, instead, to sustain
their currencies and sting the speculators.
'There are a lot of people here and among our customers who do not know what
is going on,' said one commercial bank salesman yesterday.
The French franc was up more than 5 centimes, or 1 1/2 per cent, to the
D-Mark at one stage, peaking at FFr3.4500, near to its old exchange rate
mechanism floor of FFr3.4305.
It later receded to end at FFr3.466. The sharp rise was helped by an
overnight lending rate of almost 12 per cent.
There was little sign of the French authorities restoring the liquidity to
the money market that is needed after the withdrawal of so many French
francs last week.
The Belgian franc actually re-entered its old ERM bands against the D-Mark,
peaking at BFr20.78 and finishing at BFr20.95. The Belgian central bank said
it had dropped liquidity levels in its money market rate, and overnight
money was at 15 per cent.
The Danish krone also came close to re-entering its old bands, reaching
DKr3.9305 to the D-Mark in the US, compared to an old floor of DKr3.9015.
The Danish one-month money rate stayed at 25 per cent, with the overnight
cost of lending a good deal higher.
There was no official statement suggesting that there had been any policy
co-ordination between these three central banks. But several analysts said
the policies were being co-ordinated with the intention of showing that
these currencies would not diverge too far from their old ERM parities.
Mr Christian Dunis, an economist at Chemical Bank, also suggested that the
central banks were out to teach speculators the lesson that free floating
currencies can go up as well as down.
A few dealers said they had heard of institutions losing money on the speed
of the French franc move. One influential head of foreign exchange said net
market losses in the last two days may have been substantial.
The D-Mark's decline in the ERM helped to push the dollar up in European
trading. The US currency gained some  1/2 pfennig to close at DM1.7105. It
also edged up against the yen to end at Y104.80 from a previous Y104.40. The
pound profited in this environment, rising  1/4 pfennig to DM2.5675. In New
York the dollar finished at DM1.7068 and Y104.82.
