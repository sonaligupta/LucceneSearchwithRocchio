A SPECIAL court yesterday sentenced two former Greek cabinet ministers after
acquitting Mr Andreas Papandreou, the former socialist prime minister, of
involvement in the 1988 Bank of Crete embezzlement scandal.
Although neither man is likely to go to jail, their political careers may be
over.
Mr Dimitris Tsovolas, a former finance minister, received a 2 1/2 -year jail
sentence for breach of trust, but was given the option of paying a Dr912,000
(Pounds 2,800) fine instead. Mr George Petsos, a former industry minister,
received a 10-month suspended sentence.
The 13-member tribunal cleared Mr Papandreou of charges of taking a bribe,
receiving the proceeds of a crime, and breach of trust, but only by a 7-6
majority.
Mr Papandreou was censured by the court for retaining close ties with Mr
George Koskotas, the former owner of the Bank of Crete, after it was
revealed in 1986 that he was wanted in the US on fraud charges.
Mr Papandreou, afterwards launched a scathing attack on the conservative
government of Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis, saying it won power by
deceiving Greek voters, using the judicial system as a political weapon and
orchestrating a campaign of lies.
