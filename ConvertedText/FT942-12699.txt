FT  28 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Compass


Compass shareholders of a nervous disposition will fear their company has
lost its bearings by buying Canteen. The likely rewards seem out of all
proportion to the certain risks. Corporate UK's record of buying US people
businesses is atrocious. There must be a real danger Compass will only
extend that run.
Compass argues it was able to negotiate exclusively with Canteen's parent,
Flagstar, and is buying it at a firesale price. If so, Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts, Flagstar's 67 per cent shareholder, should string up its managers
by the thumbs. Canteen would surely be worth more to a US rival, which could
have rationalised the merged business. They may also have paid a premium to
keep a better-capitalised competitor at bay. But the exit multiple of 19.5
times is hardly cheap; even though tax benefits effectively reduces it to
15.1 times. There must be doubts about how quickly Compass can turn Canteen
around given its poor trading history. Its margins have fallen from 5.5 per
cent to 3.3 per cent since 1990 on static turnover. As a subsidiary of such
a highly-indebted parent, Canteen is unlikely to be carrying excessive
costs. Additional investment will be needed to expand.
Compass shareholders may be tempted to back the company's adventurous leap,
considering the rights issue price is at a 28 per cent discount to last
month's peak price. The shame is that Compass had been doing perfectly well
expanding its UK business at a fair lick and minimal risk.
