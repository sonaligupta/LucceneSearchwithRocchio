FT  29 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Bristol Scotts cuts deficit


BRISTOL SCOTTS, which owns the Bristol Stadium and is involved in property
development and restaurants, reduced pre-tax losses from Pounds 500,000 to
Pounds 116,000 in the first half of 1993.
The result was achieved despite a fall in turnover to Pounds 4.31m (Pounds
5.09m).
Mr Anthony Kerman, chairman, said that most of the Eastgate Retail Park rent
reviews had been completed, with rents rising on average by 28 per cent. On
the residential side, the company intended to dispose of properties when the
time was right.
Greyhound racing and open markets continued to trade successfully but the
restaurant side continued in loss. Steps had been taken which Mr Kerman
anticipated would eliminate losses from that source by the year end.
Losses per share were reduced to 1.85p (9.07p).
