FT  29 APR 94 / World Trade News: US government subsidies on the increase


   By NANCY DUNNE


   WASHINGTON


The US government is showering grants - to be matched by contributions from
private industry - on a wide range of industries, Nancy Dunne writes from
Washington.
Negotiations are still under way for shipbuilding subsidies, and congressmen
this week urged the passage of two grants for textile research.
The National Textile Centre, a consortium of four universities in textile
producing regions, last year received Dollars 9m (Pounds 6.1m). The Tailored
Clothing Technology Corporation, a consortium of businesses, labour unions,
government and academia was allocated Dollars 3.4m.
Congressman John Spratt, a South Carolina Democrat, urged the approval of
new funding 'because our domestic industry can only survive the elimination
of the Multi-Fibre Arrangement if it remains competitive on the world
market.'
