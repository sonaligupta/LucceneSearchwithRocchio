FT  30 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Margins expand as Adscene hits Pounds 0.7m


Pre-tax profits at Adscene Group recovered strongly in the six months to
November 30, and shareholders benefit by having their interim dividend
doubled to 1.5p.
The group, which publishes 33 local newspaper titles in Kent, Lincolnshire
and London, saw profits rise from Pounds 462,000 to Pounds 720,000 largely
as a result of a lower cost base.
Mr Harry Lambert, chairman, said margins expanded 3 per cent to 12.6 per
cent while the interest bill fell 25 per cent to Pounds 303,000 following
the sale of the Lincoln property for Pounds 1.2m.
Turnover fell to Pounds 8.1m (Pounds 9.2m). In Kent the group lifted
publishing turnover by 13 per cent. In Lincolnshire and London advertising
revenue continued to fall but there were some signs recently that the
decline had slowed.
The printing division's turnover again reduced by 23 per cent but margins
were still above 10 per cent. There were only limited opportunities in the
immediate future for new printing contracts, Mr Lambert stressed.
Earnings per share rose to 3.01p (1.78p).
