FT  15 DEC 94 / Survey of Arab Banking (5): Profit squeeze tightens - Saudi
Arabia / Few bankers believe there is likely to be a repeat of the
disastrous loan defaults of the mid-1980s slump


   By MARK NICHOLSON


After the boom year of 1993, in which eleven of Saudi Arabia's commercial
banks posted record profits and boosted balance sheets, comes the 1994
squeeze. While the sector showed overall growth in profits of 25 per cent
last year, earnings were up just 3.5 per cent for the first half of this.
Prospects for 1995, say Riyadh bankers, look tight.
The prime reason is the sharp fall in government spending, ever the motor of
the Saudi economy, and itself the result of flat to soft oil prices, the
legacy of more than a decade of fiscal deficits and, of course, the big
one-off toll of the Gulf war. The government began 1994 by decreeing a
sweeping 19 per cent cut in spending, a target economists believe is close
to being met. Further cuts are expected in next year's budget. As a result,
banks are being caught in a tightening vice.
One side of the vice is the demands made by the Kingdom's growing private
sector, to which government payments for contracted work and supplies has
dried up in the past 18 months. Bank lending to the private sector continues
to rise - it was up 7.3 per cent in the first half of 1994 over the same
period last year - but bankers say much of this is bridging finance to tide
over unpaid government contractors. The other side is the continued appetite
of the government, which has relied heavily on the commercial banks for its
deficit financing. By mid-year, according to a study by Mr Henry Azzam,
chief economist at National Commercial Bank, Saudia Arabia's biggest, total
exposure to the government had reached 28.5 per cent of gross assets, a
total of SR299bn. Economists say the government's domestic borrowing, made
largely through the sale of treasury bills and government development bonds,
has soared from zero to Dollars 84bn since 1987.
As a result, most banks are now either up to, or even exceeding, the Saudi
Arabian Monetary Authority's statutory loans-to-deposits rato of 65 per
cent. But while the borrowing needs of both the government and the private
sector are unlikely to abate, banks are finding it increasingly difficult to
expand deposits. Money supply in the kingdom, for instance, slipped 4 per
cent June-on-June and has shrunk further since, banker say - this largely
attributed to government delays or non-payment of bills.
Few bankers, however, are unsettled by these trends. Mr Azzam, for instance,
argues that most Saudi banks remain highly liquid, still able to draw on
their deposits with banks abroad and other foreign assets, including
securities, which he puts at SR37.5bn and SR92.7bn respectively.
'Monetary authorities may find it advisable to reconsider the 65 per cent
limit they impose on customer deposits to allow banks to respond more
favourably to the credit requirement of the public and private sectors,' he
argued in a recent NCB economic bulletin.
The squeeze has also prompted some useful invention. Saudi British Bank, for
instance, in August marketed on behalf of the government a first ever
Dollars 280m issue of dollar denominated floating rate notes. Part of their
virtue is that the notes need not be booked as loans on bank balance sheets.
They are also a more appealing prospect to many banks than either
riyal-denomination T-Bills or Development bonds, both of which have become
less attractive as US interest rates have risen, and while there remain
sporadic speculative assaults on the Saudi riyal - which the Saudi
authorities remain adamant will not be devalued.
A second floating rate issue is likely soon, and some bankers in Riyadh
believe other innovations may follow - 'the traditional ways of handling the
financing of the economy have reached their limits,' says the managing
director of one leading Riyadh bank, who says he believes the Saudi capital
market may be on the cusp of a new flourishing period.
Neither do bankers appear too gloomy about the present squeeze on the
private non-oil sector, the continued growth of which has been providing
most banks with considerable opportunities. According to Mr Azzam's figures,
lending to private businesses was 70 per cent higher in the first half of
1994 than at the end of 1990.
Pressed though many businesses may be, few bankers believe there is likely
to be a repeat of the disastrous loan defaults of the mid-1980s slump - 'the
banks will ride this through,' says one bank economist. 'The banks are
better positioned than in the mid-'80s and the private sector is better off
generally and better run.'
There have also been some signs in the past two months that the government
has started paying some of its bigger overdue debts.
Most banks have, nevertheless, begun to add provisions. One of the kingdom's
biggest banks says there has been a 42 per cent rise in late loan repayment
in the past 10 months, but that the bank is not panicking yet. Many bankers
say they are becoming increasingly cautious about new private sector
lending, however.
But bankers say private businesses are considerably more tightly run today
than a decade ago, banks are more willing therefore to step in and offer
assistance and many private companies are themselves better placed since the
post Gulf war boom - 'knock on wood, I don't think we'll see the kind of
massive collapse we saw in the 1980s,' says one banker. 'It's a much more
realistic world.'
