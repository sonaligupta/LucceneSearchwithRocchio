FT  27 SEP 94 / Observer: Free press


Liberation, the fashionable French daily, is finding it hard to free itself
from the perils of technology. While the newspaper's staff celebrated until
the early hours of the morning in front of an Eiffel Tower draped with a
giant copy of the front page of the re-designed paper, the company's Paris
printing presses broke down for the second time in 21 years.
The result was that the new-look paper did not hit the streets until
yesterday afternoon. The finger was pointed at a glitch in the computer link
from the editorial centre rather than a bolshy printer who had not been
invited to the Eiffel Tower party.
