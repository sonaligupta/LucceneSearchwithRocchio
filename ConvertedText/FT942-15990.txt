FT  13 APR 94 / Spain offers cash to buyers of new cars

The Spanish government yesterday began offering cash incentives to persuade
owners of old cars to trade in their vehicles for new ones in an attempt to
revive flagging sales.
The scheme follows a similar move by the French government in February,
which has had an immediate impact in boosting new car sales above last
year's depressed level.
There is growing speculation that the new Italian government may also follow
the French and Spanish lead.
The Spanish government is offering Pta100,000 (Pounds 490) each time a car,
which is more than 10-years old, is scrapped in exchange for a new car. The
offer is due to run for six months. Carmakers have also announced incentives
of up to Pta200,000 in addition to the government's cash offer.
In France the government is contributing FFr5,000 (Pounds 585) until the end
of June next year for the withdrawal of old cars for new. The government
expects that the cost of the scheme will be balanced by higher VAT receipts
as a result of increased sales. It is forecasting an increase in new cars
sales of around 10 per cent this year.
In Spain the cash incentive is being offered as a Pta100,000 discount on the
13 per cent licensing tax levied on new cars. The total tax on cars is 28
per cent, including the 15 per cent value-added tax.
Around 37 per cent of the 13m cars on Spanish roads are 10 years old or
more. New car sales fell by 24 per cent last year to 744,000 units from
980,000 a year earlier, although demand has begun to recover in the first
two months of this year. Spanish car production fell last year by 16 per
cent to 1.5m.
In Italy, speculation that a new right-wing government would copy the French
and Spanish moves has already helped to boost Fiat's share price this week.
In Paris, the share price of the PSA Peugeot Citroen group has also been
helped by the Spanish government's move to stimulate new car sales. The
French carmaker led the Spanish market last year with a share of 20.2 per
cent.
In the UK motor industry leaders have called for incentives to encourage
scrapping of older cars to cut pollution. All new petrol-driven cars are
fitted with catalytic converters and exhaust emissions from new cars have
been cut to only a fraction of the exhaust emission levels of older
vehicles.
