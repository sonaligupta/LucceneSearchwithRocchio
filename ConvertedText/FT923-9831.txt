FT  03 AUG 92 / Letter: A lot expected of shareholders


   From Mr DAVID CRAINE


Sir, So the Confederation of British Industry (July 30) wants to remove what
little teeth to enforce corporate governance the Cadbury Committee is
proposing, and seeks to place responsibility for the enormous task of
transforming company culture in this country solely on the shoulders of
shareholders. Yet under current legislation shareholders have no means even
of influencing the agenda of company annual general meetings, let alone
effecting actual change.
Large shareholders beware, for the CBI is expecting a lot. The task to be
undertaken must not be underestimated. Reports indicate that over half of
the top 100 companies fail to meet the Cadbury Committee's standards. The
closed world of British business will struggle hard to resist scrutiny.
Until it opens up, criminal and unethical activity will flourish. Good
business practice will be the victim and with it will fall Britain's
competitiveness and international respect.
