FT  04 SEP 93 / Yield on benchmark US bond falls to 16-year low

THE yield on the benchmark 30-year US Treasury bond fell to 5.97 per cent in
trading yesterday, the first time in its 16-year history it had broken
through the psychologically significant 6 per cent barrier, after weaker
than expected employment figures pointed to continuing sluggish growth.
The yield was 8.6 per cent as recently as 1990 but has since fallen steadily
as recession and sluggish economic growth led to a downward revision of
long-term inflation expectations. The trend to lower long-term yields gained
further momentum late last year as it became clear that the Clinton
administration intended to pass deficit-cutting fiscal legislation.
The Labor Department said non-farm payroll employment fell 39,000 to 110.3m
last month, a sign that economic growth is likely to remain moderate.
Analysts had expected a gain in payroll employment of about 150,000.
Separately, the Commerce Department said the index of leading economic
indicators - a guide to future economic activity - fell 0.1 per cent in
July, reversing a 0.1 per cent gain in June.
The official unemployment rate, however, fell from 6.8 per cent to 6.7 per
cent in August, the lowest level in two years. The jobless rate is based on
a survey of household employment that is more erratic than payroll jobs
data; the household measure of employment rose 409,000 last month. The
apparent weakness of payroll employment last month was partly offset by
revisions to data for July showing a gain of 211,000 rather than the 162,000
initially reported. Payroll employment has risen substantially since
Christmas and is more than 2m above the trough reached in February 1992.
Manufacturing employment fell 42,000 to 17.7m last month the lowest level
since 1965. Manufacturers have shed 240,000 jobs in the past six months.
Service industries such as health care continued to create jobs but at a
slower pace than in recent months.
The decline in leading indicators continued a choppy path for the index this
year. Seven of 11 components pointed to economic contraction; four to
economic expansion. Recent movements of the index are consistent with
sluggish growth.
