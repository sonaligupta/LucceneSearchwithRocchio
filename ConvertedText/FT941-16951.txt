FT  07 JAN 94 / Cameroon in border row with Nigeria


   By REUTER


   YAOUNDE


Cameroon said yesterday 500 Nigerian troops had occupied two of its islands,
Reuter reports from Yaounde.
Nigeria denied the claim and sent its foreign and industry ministers to
Yaounde for talks with President Paul Biya.
Mr Francis Nkwain, Cameroon's deputy foreign minister, said the Nigerian
troops arrived on Diamond and Djabane islands in the oil-producing Gulf of
Guinea on Monday.
He said the occupation was the worst border incident between the two
countries for more than a decade but could blow over peacefully. He could
not say if the troops used force or met any resistance.
The two West African countries have a long history of border disputes and
met in the Nigerian inland capital Abuja last year to try to settle their
differences.
