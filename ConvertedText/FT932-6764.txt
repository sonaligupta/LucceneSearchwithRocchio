FT  27 MAY 93 / Row over BCCI creditors' election


LIQUIDATORS to the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International have
refused to intervene in an alleged conflict of interest on the part of a
candidate for election to the BCCI creditors' committee at Wembley Arena
today.
The BCCI Isle of Man depositors' protection association wrote to object to
the candidature of a member of the island's Financial Supervision
Commission. It is concerned that the commission does not fairly represent
the individual depositors, and that it would create a conflict of interest
if they decided they needed to sue the regulators.
