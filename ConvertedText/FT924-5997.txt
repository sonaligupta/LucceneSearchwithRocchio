FT  24 NOV 92 / 3i clients form club to protect interests


   By CHRIS TIGHE


FEARS ABOUT the impact of the planned flotation of 3i, the investment
capital group owned by the Bank of England and the clearing banks, have
prompted the setting up of a club to represent the interests of companies in
which 3i has a stake.
The club, to be formed on Friday, is intended to ensure that 3i's commitment
to long-term investment is not sacrificed to 'City short-termism' after
flotation.
The proposed aims for the club include representation on the 3i board; to
ensure the views of investee companies are heard; and the purchase of shares
at a discount when the group is floated. 3i confirmed that it intended to
float the group but that plans to do so this year had been delayed because
of the recession.
The plan to form a 3i Client Communication Club, 3i/3c, has been formulated
by Mr John Garrod, the chairman, managing director and founder of Rite-Vent,
a Tyne and Wear engineering company in which 3i holds a 22 per cent stake.
Mr Garrod said: 'The demand of the City for dividends could put considerable
pressure on 3i to force the pace with their client companies, which might
not be in the companies' interest.'
Of the 1,000 companies Mr Garrod has contacted, 250 have responded, and most
support the club proposal.
At present, 3i has no formal representational structure for companies in its
portfolio.
