FT  30 APR 94 / BCCI official was just 'functionary'


   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent


A senior Bank of Credit and Commerce International official accused of
helping to fraudulently boost the bank's profits acted honestly and on the
instructions of Mr Swaleh Naqvi, the bank's chief executive, the Old Bailey
was told yesterday.
Mr Anthony Glass QC, who was making an opening defence statement on behalf
of Mr Imran Imam, said many of the facts before the jury were not disputed.
Mr Imam, a former BCCI accounts officer, had not disclosed to the bank's
auditors details of BCCI guarantees to underwrite multi-million dollar loans
to wealthy clients. The prosecution has claimed Mr Imam did this to present
a false picture of BCCI's profitability to the outside world.
Mr Imam denies six charges including conspiring to conceal documents,
conspiring to falsify records and furnishing false information.
Mr Glass said Mr Imam had been only a 'minor functionary' in the bank and
had acted purely in an administrative capacity. He had carried out
instructions given to him by Mr Naqvi and other superiors.
The trial resumes on Tuesday.
The jury in the trial of Mr Nazmu Virani, the property entrepreneur, had
still not reached verdicts yesterday. It will resume its deliberations today
and, if necessary, on Monday.
Mr Virani, who is accused of helping artificially to boost the profits of
BCCI, denies charges of theft, false accounting and furnishing false
information.
