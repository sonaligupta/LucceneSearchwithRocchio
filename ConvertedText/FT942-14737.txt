FT  19 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Waste Management


Waste Management International has been steadily de-rated since
international investors were offered stock in 1992. Following yesterday's
slide - in response to mildly disappointing first-quarter figures - the
shares stand on a multiple of 20 times 1993 earnings. The historic multiple
at flotation was over 30 times. Recession in Europe is to blame for the
pedestrian progress since then. The question is whether WMI is now cheap
enough to tempt the UK investment institutions which shunned the original
offer.
The company has fared better in recession than most of its peers. If it can
prove that yesterday's figures were indeed the result of fluke weather and
currency movements, the rating looks fair. Gearing of around 200 per cent
following last year's acquisition binge is a reason for caution. Under US
accounting principles gearing looks less threatening. But if WMI alights on
a substantial acquisition, it might still take the opportunity to raise
fresh equity.
Besides, the fall from grace of WMX Technologies, the US parent which owns a
controlling interest, has been far more severe than that of its
international offspring. An equity issue through WMI might look like
relatively cheap funding in the context of the wider group. If the free
float of shares was increased in the process, WMI could also find a place in
the FT-SE 100 index. UK fund managers might then sit up and take note.
