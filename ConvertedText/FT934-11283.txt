FT  02 NOV 93 / US industrial growth continues for October


   By JUREK MARTIN


THE current US expansion in manufacturing continued in October, but with
little evidence of a wave of job creation, according to the National
Association of Purchasing Management.
Its monthly index of economic activity, based on reports by purchasing
executives, rose to 53.8 per cent last month from the 49.7 per cent of
September. Any reading over 50 per cent indicates expansion.
Production was at the highest level since last March, with 15 of the 20
industrial sectors covered reporting improvement over September. The new
orders index jumped to 60.8 per cent compared with 50.3 per cent in the
previous month and was the highest since the 67.2 per cent recorded in
January.
The backlog of orders increased significantly in October, with new export
orders rising for the third consecutive month. Both inventories and prices
also fell.
The NAPM, noting that its main index had averaged 51.8 per cent over the
first 10 months of this year, said a continuation of October's levels for
the final two months would imply an overall real growth in gross domestic
product for 1993 of about 2.6 per cent.
However, despite this expansion, manufacturing employment fell again in
October, although by a much smaller amount than the previous month. The
employment index stood at 45.5 per cent, up one point from September and the
highest since last March.
A reading below 48 per cent indicates no net growth in jobs. But the current
employment figures do also imply measurable gains in productivity.
The only industries reporting growth in employment in October compared to
September were furniture, fabricated metals, plastics and rubber, leather
and transportation equipment.
Meanwhile, the Commerce Department yesterday said spending on new
construction projects rose by 0.8 per cent in September.
