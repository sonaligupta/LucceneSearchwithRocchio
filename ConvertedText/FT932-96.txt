FT  30 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Rodime at Dollars 0.8m but warns on year


   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent


RODIME, the disk drive pioneer which now strives to make its living by
licensing and patenting its technology, stayed in the black in the six
months ended March 31 1993, making a pre-tax profit of Dollars 815,000
(Pounds 543,000).
However, the company warned it might not be able to maintain the profitable
trend over the full year. In the comparable period Rodime incurred a loss of
Dollars 644,000 but turned that into a profit of Dollars 1.69m by the
year-end.
The Scottish company, which produced the first 3.5 inch disk drive in
Scotland in the early 1980s, is suing Seagate, the big US disk drive maker,
for wilful infringement of its patents. It is also in litigation with Maxtor
and Quantum, two other leading US disk drive makers.
Mr Peter Bailey, managing director, said the litigation with Seagate was
'making progress' but the case was not expected to come to court in the US
until the first half of next year. Rodime successfully sued International
Business Machines for patent infringement in 1990. It believes a victory
over Seagate, which it alleges has infringed its patents on about Dollars
3bn worth of products, could be lucrative.
Mr Bailey said several other disk drive makers which Rodime claims have
infringed its patents were waiting for the outcome of the Seagate case
before settling with Rodime. The company had planned on at least some of
them settling before the Seagate case was concluded, reaching licensing or
patent agreements and paying money to Rodime.
It has negotiated increased facilities with the Bank of Scotland as it could
be faced with increased litigation costs and reduced licensing income.
Rodime achieved only one license agreement in the half year, receiving a
'modest single payment' from Sony Corporation of Japan.
