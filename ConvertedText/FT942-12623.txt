FT  28 APR 94 / International Company News: Kia considers supply deal

Kia Motors of South Korea is considering supplying Ford of the US and Mazda
of Japan, its two largest shareholders, with its Sportage four-wheel-drive
sports utility vehicle.
Under the proposed arrangement, Kia would start shipping Sportage vehicles
to Ford and Mazda later this year for sale in the US and Japan under their
own badges.
In addition, Ford would assemble the Sportage in Australia and Taiwan from
knock-down kits supplied by Kia, while Mazda would do the same in south-east
Asia. The supply would be 50,000 units.
But the proposal is being resisted by some Kia officials, who fear that it
will reduce sales of the Sportage by Kia's expanding distribution network in
the US.
Kia started establishing a distribution network in the US this year, with
its two main products being the Sportage and the Sephia compact car.
Industry analysts predict that the Sportage could be particularly popular in
the US, since its only direct competition is Suzuki Motors' Sidekick, a
version of which is also sold by General Motors' Geo franchise.
Sportage is also helping Kia's export drive into western Europe, started
last autumn with the Sephia. On Tuesday Kia announced that it planned to
assemble up to 30,000 of the vehicles annually in Germany in co-operation
with Karmann.
Ford and Mazda, which hold 10 per cent and 8 per cent of Kia respectively,
initially asked to be supplied with the Sportage last year. Kia turned down
the request, saying that its annual production capacity of 50,000 Sportage
vehicles could not meet their demand.
The company is now reconsidering the proposal at their request and holding
negotiations on royalty payments.
If it accepts the proposal, Kia would boost production of the Sportage to
100,000 units by the end of the year at its factory in Asan, South Korea.
