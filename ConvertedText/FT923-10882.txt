FT  28 JUL 92 / Algeria has 'war economy'


   By REUTER and AP


   ALGIERS


ALGERIA has switched to a war economy, Mr Belaid Abdessalam, the new prime
minister, said yesterday as he outlined a programme which showed the
country's socialist pedigree and a disdain for free-market reforms, Reuter
reports from Algiers.
Mr Abdessalam, who led the nationalisation of the oil industry in the 1970s
and has opposed tentative reforms begun in 1988, gave this sombre message in
his first news conference since taking office a week ago.
Imports have to be cut to bare essentials, closing factories if necessary,
in order to be able to service Algeria's Dollars 25bn (Pounds 13bn) of
foreign debt.
The prime minister, who is also economy minister, said it would cost Dollars
10bn this year to service the debt, out of foreign currency earnings of
Dollars 12bn. But he ruled out rescheduling the debt on the grounds this
would simply postpone the problem. He also opposed further currency
devaluation or trade liberalisation, both recommended by the IMF and World
Bank.
Tension between the Algerian government and Islamic fundamentalists
continued to smoulder yesterday as a home-made bomb exploded near a police
station in the Algiers neighbourhood of Belcourt, AP reports.
Though no one claimed responsibility for the bombing, it bore the hallmarks
of a wave of attacks by fundamentalists on police and troops in retaliation
for a harsh crackdown on their movement.  No one was injured.
