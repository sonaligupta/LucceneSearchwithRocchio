FT  13 APR 94 / International Company News: Shake-up contains fall in
profits at Dassault


   By DAVID BUCHAN


   PARIS


Dassault Aviation, the French maker of military and business jets, yesterday
announced consolidated net profit down to FFr311.2m (Dollars 53.4m) last
year from FFr329.6m in 1992, on turnover down to FFr13.2bn from FFr16.3bn.
Dassault said the relatively small drop in its profit showed the benefits of
recent restructuring, including job lay-offs, that had been made in
anticipation of a general decline in military and civil orders.
The group, which is 49.9 per cent owned by the Dassault family and 46 per
cent state-owned, with the remainder in public hands, has increased its
dividend to FFr7 from FFr6, in line with its forecast that business will
pick up in the near future.
