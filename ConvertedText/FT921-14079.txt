FT  17 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Japan seeks to increase semiconductor
imports


   By REUTER


   TOKYO


JAPAN'S Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) is asking more
companies to increase their purchases of foreign semiconductors, Reuter
reports from Tokyo.
Miti said it would now ask 226 companies (up from 63) to buy at least 20 per
cent of their semiconductors from foreign suppliers. The new group accounts
for nearly 90 per cent of the Japanese semiconductor market, compared with
80 per cent previously.
Last July's semiconductor agreement between Japan and the US set a target
figure of 20 per cent for foreign makers' share of the Japanese market. The
actual share in the fourth quarter of 1991 was only 14-16 per cent.
The largest Japanese buyers of semiconductors already buy over 20 per cent
from foreign companies, but smaller companies remain more dependent on
domestic suppliers.
Japan reaffirmed its efforts to increase its purchases of foreign
semiconductors in an 'action plan' announced during US President George
Bush's visit last week.
