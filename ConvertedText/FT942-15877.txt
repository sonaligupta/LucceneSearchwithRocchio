FT  13 APR 94 / Observer: Branson pickle


Having teamed up with Delta Air Lines, what will Virgin's Richard Branson do
for his next publicity coup?
The bearded entrepreneur, whose BA call sign is the 'grinning pullover', is
desperate to go supersonic and has been in secret talks with impoverished
Air France to borrow three of its Concordes.
The chance of Branson Concordes in Virgin livery competing head-on with the
marketing flagship of British Airways' fleet on the London to New York route
would cause apoplexy at BA's Speedbird House, particularly as Branson talks
happily of BA's Concorde seating being too cramped.
Bernard Attali, Air France's former chairman, was 'extremely keen', says
Branson. But talks have stalled since Attali lost his job last autumn. 'Once
we've got the Delta deal done, we hope to pop over to Paris and have a
little talk with Air France,' says Branson mischievously.
