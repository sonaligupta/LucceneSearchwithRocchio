FT  23 OCT 92 / Observer: Crossed off


So he was after all - awarded the military cross. Peter Phillips, joint
liquidator for the personal estate of Robert Maxwell, divulges that he has
himself set eyes on the thing - thereby silencing those unkind souls who had
been inclined to doubt the late tycoon's claims regarding the official
recognition accorded his war efforts.
Along with other possessions from the Oxford home, Headington Hill Hall  -
such as a single bottle of Chateau Mouton Rothschild 1945 - the cross will
be sold by Sotheby's at public auctions in November and December. A portion
of the proceeds from the sale will go to Maxwell's widow, Elizabeth. 'But if
she wants the cross she'll have to bid for it', Phillips explains.
