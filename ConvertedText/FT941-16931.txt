FT  07 JAN 94 / Flooding continues across South of England


   By RICHARD LAPPER


Widespread flooding across the south of England included the village of East
Lavant near Chichester, where the river Lavant burst its banks leaving
playing fields flooded.
In spite of the floods, insurers are playing down the impact on their
businesses, Richard Lapper writes. Mr Roy Randall, head of corporate
relations at Royal Insurance, said: 'The floods are not a significant event
as far as we are concerned.' Sun Alliance said it had received 300 flood
claims over the past six days but that bad weather claims were expected at
this time of year.
