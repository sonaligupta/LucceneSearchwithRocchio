FT  15 APR 94 / Moscow taxes currency trading


   By REUTER


   MOSCOW


Moscow's municipal authorities yesterday introduced a 0.1 per cent tax on
foreign exchange trading on the capital's currency exchanges. Bankers
predicted the bulk of business would shift to the unofficial interbank
market. The Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange (Micex) said the tax, which
applies to all foreign currency sales and purchases through the city
exchanges, took effect immediately. Plans to introduce the tax were
announced earlier this year despite opposition by the central bank and
commercial banks. The shift in foreign exchange trade away from Micex will
hit the central bank's ability to intervene on markets, bankers said.
Average trading volume on Micex is around Dollars 40m a day, well below the
estimated Dollars 200m on the unofficial market.
