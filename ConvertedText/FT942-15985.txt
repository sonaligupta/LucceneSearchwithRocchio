FT  13 APR 94 / Brussels set for court on Macedonia


   By GILLIAN TETT

The European Commission was yesterday poised to take Greece to the European
court over its blockade of the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia. An
intensive round of last-minute diplomacy apparently failed to persuade
Athens to back down over the issue.
The move could face the Commission with an unprecedented institutional
crisis.
A meeting of commissioners in Brussels today is expected to ask the European
Court of Justice to begin the legal proceedings against Greece, on the
grounds that the Greek action is in contravention of article 225 governing
European Union commercial policy.
It follows an ultimatum to Greece to remove its blockade or provide fresh
reasons for its action.
Although legal cases against member states normally take about 18 months to
pass through the court, Brussels is likely to ask for an emergency interim
judgment, which would probably take three to six weeks.
Commission officials yesterday said they were confident the court would find
for them. But with Greece showing little sign of backing down, and member
states apparently reluctant to provoke a head-on collision with Athens over
the issue, they admitted that it remained unclear how far any court ruling
could be enforced in the absence of a broader political agreement.
Under the newly revised article 171 of the Maastricht treaty the European
court has powers to fine a member state for a transgression of EU law, but
it has not yet done so.
