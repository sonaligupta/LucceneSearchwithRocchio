FT  17 JAN 92 / Corporate tax 10th highest in OECD


   By ANDREW JACK


THE AVERAGE rate of corporate tax in the UK is the 10th highest among the 24
countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development,
according to a survey published by the Institute for Fiscal Studies
yesterday.
The study also shows that corporate tax rates in OECD countries tend to
discourage cross-border investment and leave companies vulnerable to the
effects of inflation by favouring debt finance over equity or retained
earnings.
The analysis shows that when the real interest rate is 5 per cent, the rate
of return required before corporate taxes to persuade someone to invest in a
business enterprise would be 5.9 per cent across OECD member states. This
ignores personal taxes, and assumes average inflation at 4.5 per cent and
average weightings on the different sources of finance. The figures reflect
all corporate taxes and take into account available deductions.
Turkey has the highest required rate of return at 7.2 per cent, while the
lowest is 5 per cent in Greece and Sweden. The UK comes in the middle, at
5.9 per cent. The figures also show that the required rate of return on debt
 -an average of 2.8 per cent across all countries - makes it preferable to
new equity (at 6.1 per cent) and retained earnings (7.9 per cent).
A separate part of the study showed that across member states it is
substantially less attractive for companies to invest abroad than
domestically. The overall average transnational rate of return before tax is
5.9 per cent for domestic investment. That compares with 7.5 per cent both
for countries in one state investing abroad and for foreign companies
investing in the typical OECD country.
