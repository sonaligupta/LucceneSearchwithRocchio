FT  30 JAN 92 / International Company News: Lower metal prices hit net at
Asarco

ASARCO, one of the world's leading integrated producers of non-ferrous
metals, has recorded a steep fall in its 1991 net earnings.
Lower prices for the company's principal products of copper, lead, silver
and zinc brought the results down. They also suffered from lower prices for
specialty chemicals.
Earnings in 1991 fell to Dollars 46m, or Dollars 1.12 per share, from
Dollars 149.1m, or Dollars 3.60, in 1990. Sales were Dollars 1.9bn, down
from Dollars 2.2bn in 1990.
The decline prompted the company to halve its quarterly dividend to 20 cents
from 40 cents, the level at which it had stood since April 1989.
'In a cyclical business such as ours, the dividend rate must relate to the
company's earnings,' said Mr Richard Osborne, chairman.
In the fourth quarter, net earnings were Dollars 12.2m, or 30 cents,
compared with Dollars 3.7m, or 10 cents.
However, the 1990 fourth quarter included a non-recurring after-tax charge
of Dollars 51.5m, or Dollars 1.24 per share, for environmental clean-up and
royalty costs. Sales were Dollars 492.4m, down from Dollars 549.9m in 1990.
Mr Osborne said that although demand for copper remained strong, demand for
lead and zinc continued to be affected by the recession-hit US vehicle
market.
He noted that Pacific Rim markets had remained strong, while European
markets for base metals had weakened.
