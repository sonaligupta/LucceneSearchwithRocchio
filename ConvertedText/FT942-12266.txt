FT  30 APR 94 / US group to set up plant in Scotland


   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent


A Chicago-based company which manufactures electronic components is to set
up a plant at East Kilbride, near Glasgow, and hopes to create 400 jobs
during the next three years.
The latest addition to the substantial number of electronics companies in
what is often called Silicon Glen - the central belt of Scotland - is
International Components Corporation, which employs 900 people worldwide.
It designs and manufactures battery chargers for mobile products such as
laptop computers and mobile telephones.
Mr Jim Gaza, president of ICC, said it was setting up a plant in Europe to
meet surging demand.
The 50,000 sq ft facility at East Kilbride would carry out assembly and
testing.
Mr Gaza said ICC was attracted to Scotland because it would soon have ready
access to continental Europe via the Channel tunnel, and also because it had
a flexible workforce with experience of the electronics industry.
The Scottish electronics industry includes computer manufacturers
International Business Machines and Compaq, while Motorola has a
mobile-telephone plant.
This week the Scottish Office said output in the electronics industry rose
by 8 per cent in 1992, accounting for 20 per cent of Scottish manufacturing.
Employment fell 2 per cent to 41,500.
