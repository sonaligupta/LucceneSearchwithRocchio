FT  20 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Message from Mercury


It is hard to quibble with Cable and Wireless's interim figures. Even
allowing for wrinkles such as the Pounds 12m made from interest rate swaps,
the company for once seems to be firing on all cylinders. Cost control and
volume gains produced useful progress in Hong Kong and a dramatic turn of
speed at Mercury. Those cynics who thought Mercury may have been polished
vigorously for sale should have their suspicions calmed by the subsidiary's
29 per cent increase in turnover.
Yet with the good news already out, the shares may find it hard to push much
higher. C and W's premium to the market is getting close to a five year low;
price competition with BT may intensify, and the business climate in Hong
Kong could scarcely be more favourable than it is at present. As the
chairman acknowledges, the telecoms market worldwide is moving towards lower
margins and the company will have to manage its way through that change.
Having sold 20 per cent of Mercury for cash, the right investment
opportunities must now be found to replace that growing profits stream. The
rapid evolution of the telecoms market will generate plenty of deals. Yet
only deregulation of the European market is likely to demand large amounts
of cash, and competition for contracts will be fierce everywhere. It is
worth remembering that C and W's past success has more often flowed from
exploiting its existing franchises than winning bidding wars.
