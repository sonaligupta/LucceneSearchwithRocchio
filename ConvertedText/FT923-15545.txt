FT  01 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Finsbury Smaller Pounds 8.3m placing


Finsbury Smaller Companies Trust is proposing to raise Pounds 8.3m by a
placing and offer to shareholders of 3.3m new ordinary shares at 119p and
3.3m zero dividend preference shares at 140p.
Under the terms of the offer, existing shareholders will be entitled to take
up the new shares on a 33-for-80 basis.
Holders of 35.69 per cent of the current issued share capital have
undertaken not to take up their entitlement, which will widen the existing
shareholder base.
The 41.18 per cent of the trust previously held by Anglo Scandinavian
Investment Trust before it was taken over by Finsbury Growth Trust is being
placed with a number of institutions.
The zero preference dividend shares offer a fixed capital return paid in the
winding up of the trust, which is planned to commence on December 17 1999.
The trust also announced a same-again interim dividend of 1p for which the
new ordinary shares will not qualify.
