FT  04 AUG 92 / International Company News: First-half downturn at Baer
Holding


   By IAN RODGER


   ZURICH


CONSOLIDATED pre-tax profit of Baer Holding, the Zurich banking group, fell
13 per cent to SFr59m (Dollars 430m) in the first half of the current year,
mainly because of a sharp drop in income from securities trading.
Baer said income from securities trading tumbled by 36.9 per cent to SFr44m,
mainly because high interest rates discouraged investors from the equity
market.
Net commission income increased by 11.7 per cent to SFr91.4m, reflecting
good progress in portfolio management and investment fund business while net
interest income was flat at SFr53.4m.
The result, after other income of SFr16.5m, was a 3.3 per cent decline in
total income to SFr205.3m.
Consolidated total assets stood at SFr6bn at June 30, up 6 per cent from the
end of last year.
The value of clients' assets entrusted to the Julius Baer group rose 5 per
cent to SFr31.3bn, and the total assets of Baer Group investment funds
climbed 25 per cent to SFr2.5bn.
