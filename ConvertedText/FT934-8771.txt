FT  13 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading


   By TERRY BYLAND


A TURBULENT session in derivatives yesterday saw the December contract on
the FT-SE Index move back to a premium against the cash market, writes Terry
Byland. The highlight of the day came when, in one of the largest deals
recorded in stock index futures, a US house crossed 3,500 December contracts
at virtually the day's high point of 3,116. The deal boosted trading volume
to a similar peak of just over 19,000 contracts.
It was a different story earlier in the day, however. the December contract
fell sharply to below the 10 point fair value premium as an equity seller
insured himself.
Here the contract stayed until unexpectedly good UK trade figures changed
the mood. But it was Wall Street which drove futures to their closing
strength, for a final December reading of 3,113, a three- or four-point
premium over fair value; fair value dips to around 6 1/2 when the new equity
account opens on Monday morning.
Traded options were also busy on UK and European selling of equities.
