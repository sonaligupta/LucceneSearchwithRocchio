FT  24 MAR 92 / Government Bonds: Political concerns help weaken French
bonds


   By SARA WEBB and PATRICK HARVERSON


   LONDON, NEW YORK


FRENCH government bond futures lost nearly half a percentage point as the
combination of the Socialist Party's poor showing in Sunday's regional
elections and the fall in the German bond market pushed prices down.
French government bonds have weakened over the past fortnight on political
worries, but dealers said the regional election results were not as bad as
investors had feared, with the right-wing National Front not doing as well
as some had feared.
'There was no panic, no heavy selling, but the atmosphere was not very good
and the mood is bearish,' said one trader. The Matif futures contract fell
from 107.46 at the opening to close at 107.04 although it firmed slightly in
after-hours trading.
GERMAN government bond prices dropped on the release of higher-than-expected
money supply figures, concern about the current wage negotiations, and the
weakness in the US Treasury bond market.
The Liffe bund futures contract fell from its opening of 88.44 to end at
around 88.14, compared with Friday's close of 88.50.
German M3 money growth hit 8.6 per cent in February, compared with 9 per
cent in January, according to Mr Helmut Hesse, head of the regional central
bank in the state of Lower Saxony.
Official confirmation of the M3 data is due later this week, but Mr Hans
Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank deputy president, said that German M3 money growth
remained too high and therefore monetary policy would not change in the
short term.
Dealers said they had expected M3 money to grow by around 7.5 per cent in
February. 'M3 growth is showing no conclusive sign of decelerating' said one
trader.
The breakdown of the wage negotiations at the end of last week further
depressed the market. High wage settlements are likely to mean the
Bundesbank will continue with its tight monetary policy, dealers said.
US TREASURIES recovered from early weakness yesterday, but amid quiet
trading ahead of the week's auctions prices showed no signs of posting solid
gains.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  3/32 at 99
9/16 , yielding 8.032 per cent. The two-year note was unchanged at 99 3/16 ,
yielding 5.806 per cent.
After last Friday's big sell-off in the wake of the Philadelphia' Reserve
Bank's business outlook survey, trading opened in subdued fashion yesterday.
In the absence of important economic statistics, the market's attention
remained focused on today's auction of Dollars 14.75bn of two-year notes and
tomorrow's sale of Dollars 10.25bn of five-year notes.
In the current economic climate, with indicators showing signs of a modest
recovery, dealers are worried the injection of fresh supply could depress
prices further.
LONG-DATED UK government bonds made limited gains yesterday, shrugging off
the results of the latest batch of general election opinion polls.
Labour moved ahead of the Conservatives in four out of five polls at the
weekend.
Traders noted some switching out of short-dated gilts into the long end of
the market. The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 climbed from its
opening of 112 1/32 to 112 1/4 by late afternoon, while the 10 per cent gilt
due 1994 slipped from 99 23/32 to 99 21/32 .
Volumes in the futures market were slightly below average at 19,000
contracts, and the Liffe gilt futures contract rose from 94.04 to 94.15 by
late afternoon.
JAPANESE government bonds ended the day little changed as the market
continued to wait for the Bank of Japan to cut interest rates.
The market expects a cut in the official discount rate (ODR) - currently at
4.5 per cent - of between 50 and 75 basis points this week.
Traders said the interest rate on three-month certificates of deposit
slipped further as the money market continues to discount a cut in the ODR
and reached 4.86 per cent yesterday compared with 4.92 per cent on Thursday.
Activity in the cash market was lacklustre, with the yield on the benchmark
No 129 ending unchanged on the day at 5.345 per cent after profit-taking had
wiped out early gains.
Dealers said that the market was encouraged by news that money supply growth
in February reached a record low for the third consecutive month, with a
year-on-year rise of 1.6 per cent, compared with 1.8 per cent in January.
