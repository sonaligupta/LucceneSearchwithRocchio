FT  30 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Drugs stocks in demand


Leading pharmaceuticals stocks, which tend to be big dollar earners, ignored
yesterday's shock slide in the US currency and powered forward with the help
of technical and fundamental support. The move fuelled hope that one of the
most heavily depressed sectors in the market has turned the corner; over the
past year the pharmaceuticals sector has underperformed the FT-A All Share
Index by nearly 25 per cent.
The technical push came partly from New York where the US pharmaceuticals
sector has been gaining ground as investors switch into defensive stocks. It
also came to SmithKline Beecham, the sector's best performer, after a bought
deal in the morning left marketmakers short of stock. The squeeze on the
share price sent SmithKline up 14 1/2 to 389 1/2 p in the 'A's and 14 to
356p in the Units. Finally, dealers said that overweight UK institutions had
now adjusted their portfolios and the recent selling pressure had dried up.
The corporate relief centred on Glaxo as analysts digested the company's
legal suit against Ciba Geigy. They decided that Ciba's assault on Glaxo's
patent for Zantac, the world's top selling drug, looked less solid than
before. The shares rose 7 1/2 to 576 1/2 . Wellcome improved 9 to 524p.
