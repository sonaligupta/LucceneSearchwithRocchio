FT  15 JUN 93 / Government Bonds: Paris rate cut brings futures market to
life


   By PETER JOHN and PATRICK HARVERSON


   LONDON, NEW YORK


A CUT in French short-term interest rates enlivened the European government
bond markets yesterday, raising hopes that other countries would follow suit
shortly.
The Bank of France cut its intervention rate by 25 basis points to 7.25 per
cent and reduced its repo rate. However, the move had little effect on
short-dated French government bonds which had discounted the move.
The longer end was relatively stable with the yield on the 10-year OATs
maturing in 2003 falling 6 basis points to 6.94 per cent.
Most of the activity took place in the futures market as the 10-year June
futures contract on the Matif broke through a resistance level and rose 36
basis points to hit a new high at 118.66.
The futures contract continued higher in after hours trading.
THE FRENCH move refocused attention on the narrowing spread between
long-dated French and German yields. German bonds performed well as many
investors considered that the spread with France and other countries was too
tight. Optimism that the Bundesbank will find it easier to cut its Lombard
and discount rates - currently at 8.5 per cent and 7.25 per cent
respectively - at the next council meeting on Thursday, provided an added
lift.
Some economists are factoring in a quarter percentage point cut on Thursday
preceded by a slight reduction in the repo rate - currently at 7.60 per cent
 -on Wednesday.
The market was further buoyed by international buying and September bund
futures rose 0.16 points to 95.04.
UK government bonds took heart from the French rate cut and received an
extra lift from encouraging economic data and the successful take-up of a
Bank of England gilt tranche.
The positive yield curve flattened slightly and the September gilt futures
rose  1/4 to 104.27.
The announcement of a 4 per cent rise in producer prices was in line with
expectations and soothed some nerves over inflationary trends.
In addition, the Bank of England's offer of a Pounds 700m tranche of stock
at 8 3/4 per cent, maturing in 2017, was sold out.
Ultimately, however, the market was waiting for the outcome of the new UK
chancellor's Mansion House speech on the economy last night.
HIGH yielding bond markets were still attracting interest with Italian
government bonds very firm following Friday's interest rate cut.
The Italian bond futures contract for September rose nearly 0.40 to 10.19,
partly as a result of the half-point cut in the discount rate but also as a
result of the general appetite for high yielding currencies.
Spanish bond futures rose 0.86 to 96.45 and Portuguese bonds closed higher
on the day.
The latter were set to continue their rise after the central bank cut its
intervention rates by 0.75 point and the monthly inflation figure was
unchanged at 0.5 per cent. January 1993 five-year 12.5 per cent bonds closed
Es25 higher at Es10,255 and April 1993 seven-year 11.875 per cent bonds
closed up 31 at 10,116 escudos.
IN Sweden, another high-yielding market, government bonds closed relatively
unchanged as investors took profits following an auction of two-year and
six-year bonds.
Ten-year yields ended flat at 8.58 per cent while at the shorter end,
two-year yields were unchanged at 7.54 per cent.
US Treasury prices were flat-to-lower in subdued trading yesterday as
investors and dealers awaited today's consumer prices data.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  3/16 at 103
27/32 , yielding 6.818 per cent.
At the short end of the market, the two-year note was unchanged at 99 31/32
, to yield 4.124 per cent.
The long end retreated later in the day from its early gains as speculative
traders responded to a rebound in gold prices by selling bonds.
Trading was light because players remained cautious about the second half of
the May inflation numbers - the consumer prices data.
