FT  04 AUG 92 / World Trade News: US curb on gear imports is ruled out


   By NANCY DUNNE


   WASHINGTON


THE US Commerce Department yesterday ruled out limiting gear imports on
grounds they threaten national security, Nancy Dunne reports from
Washington.
An investigation concluded the Pentagon was expecting 'substantial
decreases' in defence gear requirements. Inter-agency experts said the US
industry was technologically competitive with foreign suppliers.
Total gear imports to the US last year totalled Dollars 2bn-worth. Japan
took 27 per cent of the market, Canada 23, France 19, Germany 10, and the UK
3 per cent. If the Department had found imports threatened national
security, President Bush would have had 90 days to decide a course of
action.
