FT  21 JUL 94 / Hungary media chiefs named


   By REUTER


   BUDAPEST


Hungarian President Arpad Goncz has appointed new heads of state television
and radio after years of political controversy over broadcasting, his office
said yesterday. He accepted nominations made by new Socialist Prime Minister
Gyula Horn and appointed Adam Horvath president of state television and
Janos Sziranyi president of state radio, after consultations with opposition
parties broke down. The opposition parties and a group of journalists had
appealed to Mr Goncz to delay the appointments. Trade unions and
broadcasters' professional groups urged him to go ahead. Many journalist
groups in Hungary and abroad have accused the former centre-right
government, which was replaced by a socialist-liberal coalition last Friday,
of using electronic media to promote itself and attack its adversaries. The
new government has proposed that parliament pass a long-stalled media law
that would enshrine guarantees of editorial independence for broadcasters
and pave the way for partially privatising electronic media, over which the
state has a virtual monopoly.
