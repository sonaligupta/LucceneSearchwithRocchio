   By REUTER


   MOSCOW


More than 30,000 coal miners were on strike yesterday as protests spread
over delays in paying wages. The finance ministry says large sums paid to
regions for wages had failed to reach workers 'for unknown reasons' and a
special commission has been set up to determine where the missing funds are
going.
