FT  12 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Logica relies on Europe for growth


   By ALAN CANE


STRONG GROWTH in the UK and continental Europe resulted in pre-tax profits
at Logica, the computing services company, almost doubling in the six months
to December 31 despite a return to losses in North America.
Mr David Mann, managing director, said he was pleased with progress but
warned that the trading environment remained harsh and charges might have to
be taken in the second half to cover restructuring measures to restore
profitability in the US.
The cost would be small, however, compared with the restructuring already
undertaken.
Pre-tax profits were Pounds 4.14m (Pounds 2.16m) on turnover up 6 per cent
at Pounds 104.2m (Pounds 98.6m). The interim dividend is raised 9 per cent
to 1.25p (1.15p) payable from earnings per share of 3.7p (2.1p).
Cash rose slightly to Pounds 15.3m at December 31, against Pounds 14.9m 12
months earlier.
More than 80 per cent of turnover is now derived from the UK and continental
Europe where revenues grew by 6 per cent and 25 per cent respectively. UK
operating margins rose to 6.8 per cent.
The black spot is still North America where substantial investment designed
to help penetrate the telecommunications and computer industry failed to
translate into new contracts, resulting in a loss of Pounds 1.4m.
Mr Mann said the company was determined to stay in the US, although not at
any price. It was refocusing on the financial services sector where it has
been growing successfully.
A 10 per cent decline in the Asia Pacific region was mainly due to currency
fluctuations.
Logica and Finsiel, the largest Italian computing services company, have
formed a joint venture called Logicasiel which, Mr Mann said, was operating
successfully. He was keen to develop stronger links with the Italian
company.
