FT  24 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Electronic components side hits Astec (BSR)


   By ANGUS FOSTER


ASTEC (BSR), the electronics company 48.9 per cent owned by Emerson of the
US, yesterday tumbled into the red as losses from its electronic components
division more than offset profits from power converter sales.
Pre-tax losses were Pounds 4.8m in the year to the end of December, compared
with profits of Pounds 4m. Turnover slipped from Pounds 283.4m to Pounds
273m.
The power conversion division increased operating profits to Pounds 6m
(Pounds 3.8m) on sales of Pounds 171.7m (Pounds 159.6m). But electronic
components and communications, which rely on the US and European computer
and information technology markets, were affected by recession and incurred
an operating loss of Pounds 5.2m (Pounds 3.9m profit).
Mr Anthony Shanagher, finance director, described the performance from
components as 'very disappointing' and hoped the division would reverse its
losses this year.
There were exceptional costs of Pounds 2.2m from redundancy and other
rationalisation costs. Staff numbers at the company's Stourbridge facility
almost halved to 300 after the manufacture of some its power supply products
was switched to Malaysia and China.
Interest charges fell to Pounds 3.4m (Pounds 3.7m). Gearing was reduced from
54.8 per cent to 39.6 per cent, mainly due to tighter working capital and
stock control. Net borrowings fell to Pounds 30m at the year-end.
Emerson took its stake in 1989 at an effective purchase price of 65p per
share. A three year standstill agreement, which prevents Emerson selling its
shares or increasing its stake, runs out at the end of this month.
