FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (2): Acquisitive adventurer -
Case study / Compass


   By DAVID BLACKWELL


Compass, the catering and healthcare group bought by the management in 1987,
surprised the City last April with a rights issue to raise almost Pounds
146m towards the cost of buying the third biggest caterer in the US for
Dollars 450m.
The purchase made Compass the third biggest catering company in the world,
behind ARA and Marriott of the US. However, Francis Mackay, chief executive,
emphasises that the US rivals are domestic businesses, while Compass is
international.
The US deal is indicative of the rapid expansion of Compass since the Pounds
160m MBO from Grand Metropolitan in 1987, which was then the biggest deal of
its kind in the UK. At the time the genial Mr Mackay was finance director,
while Gerry Robinson, now chief executive of Granada Group, was chief
executive.
'I'm sure we did have problems with the buy-out, but it did seem to go in a
very regular and quick way,' Mr Mackay recalls. 'There were no black holes -
we knew the business. Gerry Robinson had been there for three years and I
had been there for one year as finance director and managing director of the
hospitals.'
He describes the negotiations with GrandMet as 'tough, but straightforward.
The handling of the disposal was very well managed and ably done.'
The speed of the deal that was struck reflected the maturity of the MBO
market at the time and the obvious attraction to venture capitalists.
'The characteristics of the business were good for venture capitalists,' Mr
Mackay explains. 'The business had enormous growth potential, a strong cash
flow, and had been around for 50 years.'
Furthermore, the management had the luck to move when interest rates were
still around 7 per cent.
The subsequent rise in interest rates was behind the rapid flotation, which
followed at the end of 1988 and valued the business at about Pounds 200m.
'At the time of the MBO we had capping facilities to cover interest payments
for two years,' Mr Mackay explains. As interest rates started to rocket, the
group decided to float quickly to get more equity in.
The first results as an independent company showed the potential. Pre-tax
profits in the year to the end of September 1988 soared from Pounds 5m
sterling to Pounds 13.3m on sales ahead from Pounds 261m to Pounds 277m.
Nevertheless, only 68 per cent of the offer for sale was taken up at 245p
per share. It must have irritated the investors who steered clear in the
early days to see the first results as a listed company - pre-tax profits up
from Pounds 13.3m to Pounds 23.3m.
Mr Mackay blames the poor take-up of shares on the timing of the float,
which coincided with redundancies at several brokerage houses. 'They took
their eye off the ball,' he says. 'Immediately after the float the shares
went up by 1p a day for two-and-a-half months.'
The group quickly turned its attention to growing the core businesses of
catering and healthcare. Within two years of the flotation it had got out of
property services, building services and security.
'You have to get quickly back on the growth part,' explains Mr Mackay. 'An
MBO brings financial discipline - in the first years the debt structure
means you want cash flow to be as rapid as possible. Then you need to start
looking for investment and growth.'
The group has been growing ever since, with the only apparent setback coming
in 1992 when it failed to acquire principal rival Gardner Merchant from
Forte.
However, with the benefit of hindsight Mr Mackay believes that losing
Gardner Merchant has been more beneficial. 'We have expanded into new market
sectors and broadened our market base. Gardner would have given us much more
volume - but in one sector.'
At the end of 1993 the group was able to report a 31 per cent rise in
profits (Pounds 41.5m for the year ended September) on the back of good
performances by its acquisitions.
Turnover moved ahead 44 per cent to Pounds 497m, including a contribution of
Pounds 156.2m from acquisitions, mainly reflecting the purchase of SAS
Service Partner's airport catering business via a rights issue, and the
acquisitions of Travellers Fare, the station caterers, and Letheby
Christopher, the sports and events caterer.
This year's deal to buy US caterer Canteen Corporation was by far Compass's
most adventurous acquisition. Mr Mackay described the deal at the time as 'a
one-off opportunity to buy into the world's biggest food market at a price
that is sensible'.
The deal was funded by a 6-for-19 rights issue, priced at 270p. Earlier this
week, the shares were at 328p, giving the group a market capitalisation of
almost Pounds 780m.
Since the 1987 MBO, turnover has grown from Pounds 250m to a pro forma
Pounds 1.5bn. At the time of the float the management held 10 per cent of
the shares, but now holds only 2 to 3 per cent, mainly because of the
expansion.
But Mr Mackay points out that some of the original venture capitalists still
have a stake in the group, the biggest being the Prudential with just under
3 per cent.
