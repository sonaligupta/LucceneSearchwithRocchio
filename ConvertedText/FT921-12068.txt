FT  29 JAN 92 / The Guinness Trial: Ex-Morgan chief 'not consulted'


   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent


A FORMER head of corporate finance at Morgan Grenfell said yesterday that he
had not been consulted about the purchase by Morgan of Guinness shares held
by LF Rothschild, a New York investment bank.
Mr Graham Walsh said LFR had been mentioned to him by Mr Roger Seelig, a
former Morgan finance director and a defendant in the trial, as one of the
'friends' which had bought Guinness shares during the bid battle for
Distillers.
Mr Seelig had referred to LFR in a discussion about placing Morgan's
Distillers shares that had been converted into Guinness shares after being
assented to Guinness's bid. He had also spoken of trying to place shares
bought by 'friends' of Guinness.
There had, Mr Walsh said, been no discussion of Morgan buying the LFR
holding to stop it being put on the market and affecting the Guinness share
price. As the holding was less than half of 1 per cent of Guinness's shares
he would not have thought it would have had any effect on the price.
Mr Walsh agreed that Mr Seelig had been concerned that disorganised sales of
Guinness shares might disrupt the market and jeopardise the company's share
re-purchase plans.
He said he had only learnt about Morgan buying the LFR holding after the
event. He had been irritated because it had not been the first time he had
not been consulted about a large share purchase. He added that his
irritation had not been directed at Mr Seelig.
He said he had assumed that if Mr Christopher Reeves, Morgan's group chief
executive, had authorised the purchase it had been on the basis that the
shares were a good investment.
Mr Seelig and Lord Spens, former corporate finance director at the Henry
Ansbacher merchant bank, deny fraud and false accounting charges.
Mr Seelig's cross-examination of Mr Walsh continues today.
