FT  24 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Canning holds distribution despite 16% fall
to Pounds 5.7m


   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent


W CANNING, the Birm-ingham-based speciality chemicals and electronics
distribution group, is maintaining its dividend despite a setback in pre-tax
profits for 1991.
Profits fell 16 per cent to Pounds 5.72m, compared with Pounds 6.84m,
achieved on turnover of Pounds 117m (Pounds 125.8m). Earnings per share
worked through at 12.2p (12.7p).
But the costs of meeting the closure of electronic distribution businesses
in Germany and Spain, tax and the dividend payment wiped out profits and led
to a retained loss of Pounds 1.25m.
The Pounds 2.1m cost of the dividend, maintained at 7.29p with a final of
4.35p, was, in effect, met by increasing borrowings so that gearing was 58
per cent against a target of 45 per cent.
Mr David Probert, chairman, said that that the dividend was justified by the
fact that extraordinary charges would not recur and that the group had
Pounds 6m of surplus assets, largely property, which once sold would reduce
gearing 'comfortably below 45 per cent'.
Last year the group saw sales in its electronic distribution business
falling quarter by quarter.
By contrast the speciality chemical business held up well and increased
operating profits from Pounds 5m to Pounds 7.05m.
The current year has started steadily. Chemical sales and profits were
higher and electronic equipment sales were better than the last quarter of
1991 although lower than in the first quarter.
The 1992 figures would respond to cost-cutting measures taken in 1991. But,
said Mr Probert, 'I do not envisage any significant improvement in
underlying demand levels until the last quarter of the year at the
earliest.'
