FT  15 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Fisons launches asthma drug in US


   By PAUL ABRAHAMS


FISONS, the healthcare and scientific instruments group, yesterday began
marketing Tilade, an asthma treatment, in the US.
'This is Fisons' last throw of the dice to remain a viable pharmaceutical
entity,' said Mr Paul Woodhouse, drugs analyst at Smith New Court. 'They
have to make this launch work'. The company is co-promoting the product with
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer.
The groups aim to position the product for those with mild asthma who use a
bronchodilator, such as Ventolin, more than three times a week. Whereas
bronchodilators help improve symptoms, Tilade is designed to treat the
underlying inflammation.
Fisons is co-promoting Azmacourt, RPR's inhaled steroid medicine, which is
designed for patients using bronchodilators more than three times a day.
US doctors have been reluctant to prescribe inhaled steroids because of
potential side-effects.
'The group has a window of opportunity to establish this drug before safer
second-generation inhaled steroids come on the market,' said Mr Woodhouse.
Tilade was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in January, but
Fisons waited for the results of a further clinical trial to show it was
more effective than Intal, its other asthma treatment.
