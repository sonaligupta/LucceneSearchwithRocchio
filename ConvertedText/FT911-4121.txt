FT  20 APR 91 / Dan-Air buys ex-Air Europe jet


   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent


DAN-AIR, the Gatwick-based carrier owned by Davies & Newman Holdings, has
acquired one of the former Air Europe Boeing 737-400 aircraft to provide
additional capacity for its expanding airline and charter business.
Dan-Air has been one of the main beneficiaries of the collapse of
International Leisure Group and Air Europe.
In a newsletter to shareholders Mr David James, the Davies & Newman
chairman, said that the new management's target was to establish Dan-Air 'as
an independent, stand-alone airline'.
Mr James had earlier indicated that the company was considering the
possibility of either selling or merging Dan-Air with another group. But
Dan-Air now appears increasingly confident that it can develop and expand on
its own.
Mr James said he believed the company could achieve this with its available
resources. But he confirmed the group was considering a new capital funding
to give Dan-Air greater strength for the future. The company is understood
to be seeking about Pounds 30m.
Dan-Air has applied to the Civil Aviation Authority for several new European
routes, including many previously operated by Air Europe. That is part of
its strategy of becoming the leading short-haul European scheduled airline
operator based at Gatwick.
Although the collapse of Air Europe had given Dan-Air the opportunity to
grow by expanding its European route network, Mr James warned that the loss
of Air Europe had revived the argument over how much competition is a help
or hindrance to the health of the aviation industry in general.
Mr James said that while he favoured competition, he was opposed to
'destructive competition which effectively prevents any one company
achieving financial stability'.
