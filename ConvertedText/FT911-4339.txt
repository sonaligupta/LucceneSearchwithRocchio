FT  19 APR 91 / CBI report finds large fall in R&D


   By CHARLES LEADBEATER, Industrial Editor


BRITISH INDUSTRY'S investment in research and development has fallen
markedly since 1988 in spite of strong economic growth and profits over the
past three years, according to a report sponsored by the Confederation of
British Industry and published yesterday.
The report, produced by Sciteb, the management consultancy, shows that
industry-funded R&D as a proportion of the domestic product of industry has
fallen from just over 1.4 per cent in 1988 to about 1.2 per cent, compared
with 2.3 per cent for Germany and Japan.
The report shows that British-owned companies which spend more than Dollars
100m (Pounds 56m) a year on R&D invest about 2.8 per cent of their sales on
R&D compared with 4.5 per cent in the rest of the world. The percentage of
US patents granted to UK residents has been steadily declining, whereas the
percentage granted to Germans and Japanese has risen.
