FT  08 NOV 94 / Odeon plans Pounds 10m cinema expansion


Odeon Cinemas plans to invest Pounds 10m next year in upgrading and
expanding its cinema chain. The company, one of the UK's biggest film
exhibitors, plans to add new screens to its cinemas at Marble Arch and
Holloway in London, and at Bradford, Hull, Sheffield, Salisbury and
Bournemouth.
The investment programme follows five years of steady investment by Odeon,
reflecting the general trend in the film industry to upgrade existing
cinemas and to open new edge-of-town multiplex sites.
