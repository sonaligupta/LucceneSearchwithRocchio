FT  13 MAR 93 / JCB wins green belt battle


THE GOVERNMENT is to allow JC Bamford Excavators, one of the UK's largest
privately owned groups, to build a factory in the green belt near Cheadle,
Staffordshire.
The Department of the Environment ruled that although the development was
inappropriate 'in this most exceptional of cases' economic benefits
outweighed such harm as might be caused to the green belt.
