FT  06 NOV 93 / Deng wants patriots for HK


   By TONY WALKER


   BEIJING


Mr Deng Xiaoping, China's paramount leader, has warned that only 'patriots'
would be permitted to administer Hong Kong once its reverts to Chinese rule
in 1997, Tony Walker reports from Beijing.
Mr Deng's remarks, published yesterday in the Chinese press, are certain to
deepen concerns among pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong about possible
reprisals against public figures who have expressed misgivings about
Beijing's intentions. He defined 'patriots' as those who supported the
'motherland' and did nothing to hurt Hong Kong's prosperity and stability.
