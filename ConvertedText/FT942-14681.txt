FT  19 APR 94 / International Company News: Time Warner trims net deficit to
Dollars 54m


   By MARTIN DICKSON


Time Warner, the US entertainment group, yesterday reported a first-quarter
net loss of Dollars 54m, compared with Dollars 124m a year ago. It
registered a slight rise in operating earnings as strong growth in its film
and publishing businesses were partly offset by dips in cable and music.
The group said combined earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortisation (Ebitda), for the group and for Time Warner Entertainment,
totalled Dollars 639m on revenues of Dollars 3.485bn. That compared with
earnings of Dollars 632m on revenues of Dollars 3.277bn a year earlier.
Time Warner Entertainment, a subsidiary grouping its Warner Brothers' film
business, HBO cable channel and cable systems, reports its operating results
on a deconsolidated basis.
The group, which was left with a heavy debt and depreciation burden
following the 1989 merger between Time and Warner, tries to focus attention
on Ebitda as a measure of its underlying performance.
The net loss after preferred dividends worked through at 14 cents a share,
against a net loss of 33 cents in the same period of last year.
Mr Gerald Levin, chairman, said the growth in Time Warner's copyright
businesses had allowed it to sustain an increase in Ebitda, in spite of the
Federal government's first round of the re-regulation of cable industry
prices last September.
The Warner Brothers' film business produced a record Dollars 117m of
earnings, up 10 per cent from a year before. HBO produced record earnings of
Dollars 61m, up 11 per cent, but the cable business saw a drop to Dollars
244m from Dollars 255m because of the new government regulations.
The publishing business, Time Inc, saw earnings rise 25 per cent to Dollars
70m. The Warner music business earned Dollars 147m, down from Dollars 160m.
