FT  27 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Confidence at AMV after 58% advance


   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent


Abbott Mead Vickers, the advertising group, yesterday reported a 58 per cent
increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 2.38m for the half year to June 30,
against Pounds 1.5m.
Mr David Abbott, chairman, said the increase represented a 'step-change' in
profitability. Last year's new business wins and increased spending by
existing clients had begun to show significant benefits to the company, he
said.
He described the outlook as the brightest for many years, and predicted that
underlying client spending would continue to increase.
Turnover increased 14 per cent to Pounds 108.1m (Pounds 94.4m). Earnings per
share jumped from 5.71p to 9.16p.
A rise in the interim dividend to 4.5p (3.2p) reflected increasing
confidence in the sustainability of the company's performance, as well as
the strength of its cash position, said Mr Abbott. The board is also
proposing a 1-for-1 scrip issue.
Annualised new business gains during the first half totalled more than
Pounds 100m, a record for the group, including work for British
Telecommunications and Motorola.
In July, the group announced it had bought Redwood Publishing, the contract
publisher, for an initial cash payment of Pounds 2.85m. Mr Abbott said
second half figures would reflect contributions from the acquisition.
The shares gained 11p to close at 684p.
