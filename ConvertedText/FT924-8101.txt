FT  12 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Mayhew hopes to persevere on Ulster


   By RALPH ATKINS


SIR PATRICK Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said yesterday that the UK
government would continue to look to dialogue - not an imposed solution - to
end the province's political problems.
In spite of the failure of the latest set of 'round-table' talks, which
collapsed on Tuesday, Sir Patrick said the government would 'steadily
persevere'. He said the six months taken up by the talks, 'is but a evening
gone,' in Northern Ireland's history.
Sir Patrick said the participants, including nationalists, Unionists and the
Irish government, had shown a 'marked increase in the understanding of the
position taken by others and respect for them'.
Mr James Molyneaux, Ulster Unionist party leader, called for more informal
links between the province's political parties to discuss social and
economic issues. Sir Patrick backed any discussions but warned that sight
should not be lost of the 'objective' of addressing the 'totality of
relationships'. Both the British and Irish governments are hopeful that a
fresh set of 'round table' talks could start early next year. Ministers from
the two governments meet on Monday.
Sir Patrick believed that a comprehensive solution could yet be found and
hinted strongly that he would not set out his own proposals for how direct
rule could be ended.
'There is no question of an imposed solution. What the British government is
about is doing all in its power to seek a settlement of this deeply rooted,
historic problem which is arrived at by agreement with all those who are
concerned with it,' he said.
The Rev Ian Paisley, Democratic Unionist leader, said there would be no
progress until Dublin gave up its 'illegal, immoral and criminal claim over
the territory of Northern Ireland'.
