FT  09 JAN 92 / Observer: Shrinking fortune


Are you keeping your shrink informed? Joan Weill, wife of Sandy, Primerica
Corp chairman, was unburdening herself to one particularly attentive
psychiatrist back in 1985 when the unthinkable happened. The shrink actually
took notice of what she was saying.
Her husband, the former number two at American Express, had confided his
ambitions to become top dog at BankAmerica, and she was throwing a wobbly
about the ensuing disruption to their personal lives if he met success. The
psychiatrist's no doubt deep concern for his patient's well-being did not
apparently prevent him from stepping smartly out to purchase BankAmerica
stock - on which he is accused of raking in a tidy Dollars 27,475 (Pounds
15,000) when Weill's crazy idea surfaced.
This week the said shrink, narrowly escaping prison for his insider dealing,
has been sentenced to five years' probation and 600 hours of community
service annually; he has also now collected fines amounting to Dollars
287,000. Observer wonders what this will do to his billing rate.
