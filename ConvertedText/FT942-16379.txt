FT  11 APR 94 / People: Wilmot's hopes for multimedia


   By ALAN CANE


Robb Wilmot, once the enfant terrible of the UK electronics industry, is
approaching 50 but his enthusiasm for all things digital seems undiminished,
writes Alan Cane.
The former chairman of International Computers is spending increasing
amounts of time in the US where he is busy starting new companies. He is
buying a residence on the West Coast but intends to keep his riverside home
in Oxfordshire.
Wilmot likes vintage boats almost as much as he likes starting companies.
Since leaving ICL in the mid-1980s, he has been the motive force behind a
slew of innovative but patchily successful ventures, including European chip
manufacturer ES2, pocket computer-maker Poquet and Oasys, recently sold to
Sybase.
Now he is caught up in the explosion of excitement over 'multimedia'. He
foresees a battle between the big equipment manufacturers and the
entrepreneurs; he is firmly on the side of the latter.
He is taking a down-to-earth approach and is eschewing grandiose schemes to
run fibre optic cable to every home in favour of ways of delivering high
quality services using the existing infrastructure - telephone lines, cable,
radio.
Others, inevitably, are focusing on the same approach. Some, like Microsoft,
are big and powerful. How does Wilmot intend to make money? 'That,' he says
cryptically, 'is the secret', and promises greater enlightenment anon.
