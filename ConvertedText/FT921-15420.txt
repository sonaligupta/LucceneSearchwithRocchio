FT  10 JAN 92 / International Company News: SBC to acquire Chicago group


   By IAN RODGER


SWISS Bank Corporation (SBC) is to acquire The O'Connor Partnerships, the
Chicago-based specialists in equity and currency options.
The move, subject to approval by the US Federal Reserve Board, comes a
little more than a year after SBC invested SFr90m (Dollars 69.2m) in an 80
per cent stake in a joint venture with O'Connor, called SBC-OC Services.
SBC said the proposed acquisition was aimed at improving the bank's
penetration of US investment banking markets.
