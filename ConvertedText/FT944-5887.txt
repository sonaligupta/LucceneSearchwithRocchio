FT  01 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Bondholder support for overhaul of Heron


   By SIMON DAVIES


The reconstruction of Heron International under US entrepreneur Steven Green
became a virtual formality yesterday, when bondholders voted in favour of
the buy-out of Gerald Ronson's collapsed property empire.
A number of conditions still need to be met before the offer becomes
unconditional, but the bondholder meetings were the main hurdle. Mr Green's
offer won 99 per cent support from both classes of bonds.
A spokesman for Heron said: 'We are very pleased with the result, and we are
confident that we will reach a successful conclusion.'
Mr Green's HNV Acquisition has yet to receive approval from the Head Office
Banks.
However, they have given verbal commitments to support the deal and the
delay in approval is a 'technical hitch' at one of the banks.
A meeting was to be held in the US yesterday by the Resolution Trust
Corporation to consider a proposed settlement concerning the collapsed
financial services group Pima - another condition of the offer.
However, the bond meetings demonstrated overwhelming support for the HNVA
proposals. Around 70 per cent of senior bondholders voted, along with 73 per
cent of the junior bondholders.
Investors were given cash or share options, but Mr Green's consortium, which
includes Rupert Murdoch and the family trust of Michael Milken, will retain
at least HNVA 51 per cent of Heron, if the deal becomes unconditional.
