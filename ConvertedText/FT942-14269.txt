FT  21 APR 94 / Cut in duty on alcohol ruled out


   By TONY JACKSON


A Treasury minister yesterday poured cold water on the idea that the
government might cut duty on alcoholic drinks as a means of recouping
revenue lost through cross-Channel trade.
Sir John Cope, the paymaster-general, told a conference in London: 'If we
were to sharply cut the rate of duty, there is no way we would get back more
than a fraction of the billions of lost revenue from increased UK sales.'
Since the introduction of the European single market at the start of last
year the amount of beer and other drinks imported by shoppers from the
European mainland has increased sharply. The drinks trade argues that
imports are cutting government revenue as well as damaging its own business,
and has urged the government to cut rates of duty.
While disclaiming any knowledge of what the chancellor would do in the next
Budget, Sir John said revenue had not been harmed. In the first three months
of this year alcohol duties were up 7 per cent on the year before. In 1993
as a whole, duty receipts had been up for every category of drink.
Sir John said total duty plus value added tax on alcohol this year would
come to Pounds 6.1bn. The highest estimate produced by lobbyists for lost
revenue in 1993 was Pounds 250m. Even accepting that figure meant a loss of
under 5 per cent of the yield, he said.
Sir John played down suggestions that the European Commission might oblige
the UK to permit cross-Channel drinks shopping by telephone. The official
who had expressed that view had been promptly 'slapped down' by the European
tax commissioner, he said.
Whisky exports exceeded Pounds 2bn for the first time last year, the Scotch
Whisky Association said yesterday. The value of exports rose by more than 5
per cent to Pounds 2.06bn.
