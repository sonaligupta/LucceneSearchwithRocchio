FT  15 JUN 93 / British executives in Cuba trade talks


   By REUTER


   HAVANA


A GROUP of British business executives is visiting Cuba for talks on trade
and investment opportunities in such fields as tourism, the oil industry and
bio-technology, Reuter reports from Havana.
'We are particularly interested in the Hispanic Caribbean. . . we see
opportunities for economic development,' Baroness Young, a former
Conservative minister and the delegation leader, said in Havana.
The 14 executives in the group were to have talks with Cuban trade officials
during their three-day stay on the communist-ruled island. Britain's
Caribbean trade advisory group organised the visit.
Mr Raul Taladrid, a vice-president of Cuba's state committee for economic
co-operation, told Lady Young that Cuba was interested in increasing its
trade relations with Britain.
Asked about Britain's attitude to the US trade embargo against the country,
which the Cuban government says hinders trade and investment from other
countries, Lady Young said: 'The British government's position is that we
have trade relations with Cuba and are interested in building them up'.
