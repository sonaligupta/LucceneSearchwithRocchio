FT  20 APR 94 / Inkatha poses sticky problem for poll staff


   By MARK SUZMAN


   JOHANNESBURG


Inkatha's 11th hour decision to take part in the elections has created
daunting practical problems - not least how to get its name on 80m ballot
papers writes Mark Suzman in Johannesburg.
Regional and national ballot papers have already been printed and there is
no plan to pulp them.
Tens of thousands of officials from the Independent Electoral Commission
will have to spend their weekend affixing to the papers adhesive stickers
bearing Inkatha's name, logo and Chief Buthelezi's photograph.
To cater for the increase in expected voters in KwaZulu/ Natal province, a
further 700 polling booths will have to be set up and monitors hired and
trained to staff them.
Not only does Inkatha have to submit candidates to the IEC by tomorrow
night, but legislation to pass the constitutional amendments has to be drawn
up by the multi-party negotiating council, ratified by the governing
Transitional Executive Council and then approved by parliament as its final
act next Monday.
