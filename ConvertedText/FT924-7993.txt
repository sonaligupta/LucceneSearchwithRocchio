FT  13 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: BT


BT ought to be moderately satisfied with second quarter profits of Pounds
431m. They were at the top end of expectations even after a Pounds 386m
redundancy charge. Better still, there was a faint hint of volume recovery
which appears to be continuing. Add that to an 8 per cent interim dividend
increase, and a 4 per cent jump in its shares looks a natural response.
The longer term, though, offers less ground for excitement. Yesterday also
saw the management trotting out a long list of reasons for not addressing
the strategic questions raised by its looming cash surplus and setbacks
overseas. Not only is there regulatory uncertainty; BT also faces some large
calls on its cash. Changes to the VAT rules mean a Pounds 900m tax payment
in the second half. Pension fund contributions may have to resume at a rate
of Pounds 200m next year.
It is much too early for management to take seriously the more extreme City
suggestions like a mega-dividend or share buy-back scheme. For the time
being the prospect of generous real dividend growth ought to underpin the
shares. This attraction is offset by worry that BT's fascination with North
America will prompt a third unlucky attempt to strike it rich there.
Besides, a 10 per cent yield premium to the market is on the low side for
BT. And if its business really is reviving, so is the economy as a whole.
Defensive stocks like BT would find it hard to outperform in a recovery.
