FT  12 MAR 94 / In 40 years' time, black Africa might reach the level of
wealth it had 20 years ago: IMF reforms are paying off, but the continent is
way behind the rest of the world, says the World Bank


   By MICHAEL HOLMAN, Africa Editor


Unless sub-Saharan Africa's 'poor' economic policies improve, it will be 40
years before the region returns to its per capita income of the mid-1970s,
warns a World Bank report on the region published tomorrow.
Even Ghana, rated the best of Africa's reforming countries which has
achieved real growth of about 5 per cent a year, is still among the world's
poorest countries: 'At this growth rate, the average Ghanaian will not cross
the poverty line for another 50 years,' says the report.
The report is the most sombre in a series that go back to the early stages
of Africa's economic crisis. Past studies have combined tough appraisals
with upbeat expectations of reform. The latest study warns that success will
not come easy, but cautions against 'undue pessimism', pointing to the fact
that Asian countries which had almost no growth between 1930 and 1960 now
enjoy 'stunning' growth.
Structural adjustment is essential but not sufficient if sub-Saharan Africa
is to achieve sustained growth, says the World Bank in a 280-page appraisal
of economic reform. But while it stresses the need for 'good governance' in
Africa, the report does not elaborate on either the measures required, or
assess its impact on economic performance in the years under review.
Of the 29 countries studied in the report, the six with the most improvement
in macroeconomic policies between 1981-86 and 1987-91 enjoyed the strongest
resurgence in economic performance, with an average annual growth of 2 per
cent in GDP.
By contrast, says the report, countries that did not improve their policies
saw their GDP decline by 2 per cent a year, in all likelihood increasing the
number of poor.
Although the outcomes are 'encouraging' they are not as positive as they
might be. Current growth rates among the best African performers are still
too low to reduce poverty much in the next two or three decades.
'So far the rebounds have merely bought countries back to their historical
trend of low growth, and it is not yet clear whether they are shifting onto
a higher growth path.
'Without further substantial increases in agricultural, investment, export
and GDP growth, sub-Saharan Africa will continue to lag behind other
developing nations.'
The report examines the relationship between economic policy and growth in
sub Saharan Africa, by comparing the performances of 29 countries during two
periods: 1981-86, when the region was in economic crisis but few countries
were implementing economic reforms, and in 1987-91 when most African
governments had adopted World Bank supported structural adjustment
programmes.
The six leading reformers reduced budget deficits, curbed inflation,
introduced competitive exchange rates, tariff reforms and agricultural
incentives.
Countries that have liberalised their pricing and marketing of agriculture
have seen a resurgence in domestic production of both food and export crops,
says the Bank.
The study 'also shows that it is not always true that devaluation
necessarily results in higher rates of inflation provided there were
complementing policies of wage, fiscal and monetary restraint . . . and
indeed reaped the benefits in terms of competitiveness on the world market.'
Export volumes increased significantly, despite declining terms of trade, if
the exchange rate, agricultural pricing and marketing liberalisation polies
were implemented, says the report.
Comparing Africa and other developing regions, the Bank says: 'It is
worrisome that even the best performers in Africa do not come close to
matching the good macroeconomic policies typified by Chile, Malaysia, Mexico
and Thailand, where inflation is close to 10 per cent a year, budget
balances range from deficits of 2 per cent of GDP to small surpluses and
currencies are fully convertible, at least for current account
transactions.'
African governments are criticised for slow progress in privatisation. 'The
value of privatisations in Nigeria between 1988 and 1992,' says the Bank,
'was less than 1 per cent of that in Argentina, Malaysia or Mexico, even
after adjusting for Nigeria's smaller GDP.'
Africa's financial sector is still 'heavily burdened' by public sector
demands for credits, says the Bank. Central governments alone (excluding
public enterprises) absorb more than 30 per cent of domestic credit.
'There is substantially more room for improving policies,' said Mr Kim
Jaycox, the Bank vice president for Africa, at a press conference in
Washington to launch the study.
'Macroeconomic policies deteriorated in a third of the countries, and no
country has achieved a first rate macroeconomic policy stance - low
inflation, very low budget deficit and a competitive exchange rate,' he
said.
Africa performs particularly poorly in comparison with other developing
countries.
In 1965, Indonesia's GDP per capita was lower than Nigeria's. Today, it is
three times higher. Thailand's income per head in 1965 was lower than
Ghana's; now it is one of the fastest growing economies in the world.
The report notes Africa's declining share of developing-country exports of
food and agricultural products. It halved between 1970 and 1990 (from 17 to
8 per cent) with Asia increasing its market share. The high rate of
population growth - more than 3 per cent a year - strains the limited
resources available.
Adjustment programmes can establish a framework for sound investment and
efficient resource use, but are no substitute for long-term development
efforts to build the capabilities of Africa's people by putting adequate
resources into education and strengthening weak management capacity.
'Emphasis on universal primary education is the key to achieving rapid
growth in the best performing Asian economies,' says the bank.
Other central policy measures which are vital include the need to accelerate
divestiture programmes and develop financial sectors. Reducing Africa's
external debt burden and maintaining aid flows 'is essential', says the Bank
'but debt relief and aid only make sense if sound economic reform programmes
are in place.

THE VIEW FROM THE WORLD BANK OVER 14 YEARS

1994
Current growth rates among the best African performers are still too low
to reduce poverty much in the next two decades. So far, the rebounds
have merely brought countries back to their historical trend of low
growth, and it is not yet clear whether they are shifting onto a
higher-growth path. Without further substantial increases in
agricultural, investment, export and GDP growth, Sub-Saharan Africa will
continue to lag behind other developing regions.
