FT  05 JUN 92 / International Company News: Extremely flexible legislation
used for officer's appointment


   By ANDREW JACK


THE CANADIAN courts took an unprecedented step by appointing Mr Bernard
Wilson as 'information officer' when Olympia & York filed for protection
from its creditors under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act.
No previous example of this post exists, but the legislation under which he
was appointed is extremely flexible.
The Act, passed in 1933, proved popular during the Depression. It then fell
into dis-use, but has seen a resurgence during the last few years. It runs
to only a few sections in the law books and has left the courts considerable
discretion in how to operate the procedure.
Mr Wilson's appointment is one example of this flexibility, and comes as a
direct response to complaints from creditors to O&Y about lack of
sufficient, up-to-date financial information.
The CCAA restructuring allows O&Y's management to remain in charge of the
companies as the 'debtor in possession'. Creditors are sub-divided into a
series of different voting classes, and a negotiating process with them
begins under court supervision.
Once the debtor has drawn up a reorganisation plan, it must be approved by
three-quarters of the creditors by value in each class. The original CCAA
petition granted the management until July 13 to file their plan with the
court, and a further 60 days to gain creditors' approval - although these
dates are likely to be extended. The plan needs to be approved by the court.
