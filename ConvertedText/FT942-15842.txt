FT  13 APR 94 / UK Company News: Allied Radio in Pounds 1.55m rights and
restructure


Allied Radio, broadcaster to Surrey, Sussex and Hampshire, yesterday gave
details of the Pounds 1.55m rights issue and capital restructure
foreshadowed last week.
It also reported results for the year to end-September showing turnover of
Pounds 3.75m (Pounds 4.55m), including continuing operations static at
Pounds 3m, while losses at the pre-tax level were Pounds 1.9m (Pounds
1.72m). Losses per share were 4.1p (3.4p).
The rights issue is of 33.3m new 0.5p shares at 6p on the basis of 3.61 new
shares for every 10 existing 25p ordinary held and 2.872 new shares for
every Pounds 1 nominal of outstanding loan stock.
It is planned to exchange each Pounds 1 of outstanding loan stock for 10 new
ordinaries with the cancellation of interest on the loan stock from October

The existing 25p ordinary shares are to be converted into one new 0.5p
ordinary and 49 deferred of 0.5p. The deferred will be cancelled and the
balance, together with the share premium account, will be used to write off
the deficit on the p and l account, and the existing goodwill  - Pounds 7.2m
and Pounds 8.5m respectively at end-September.
