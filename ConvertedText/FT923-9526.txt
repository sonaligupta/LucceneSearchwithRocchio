FT  05 AUG 92 / Brazilian minister quits amid scandal


   By CHRISTINA LAMB


   BRASLIA


PRESIDENT Fernando Collor of Brazil, battling to stay in power amid a
worsening corruption scandal, has been dealt a heavy blow by the resignation
of one of his most senior ministers.
Mr Jose Goldemberg, education minister, is the first cabinet member to quit
since the political crisis erupted in May with a series of corruption
allegations against the president. The minister resigned on Monday night,
provoking much speculation that other ministers might follow suit.
Citing 'political and personal reasons' for quitting, Mr Goldemberg accused
the government of greater concern for its own survival than for the
Brazilian people, and of lack of commitment to education.
Mr Goldemberg, 63, was the only remaining civilian member of the original
Collor cabinet of three years ago.
Yesterday, Mr Jorge Bornhausen, minister in the president's office, sought
to dismiss fears that other ministers would follow Mr Goldemberg.
Mr Collor has also managed to hold on to his economic team by agreeing to
maintain his austerity policy. The team had threatened to resign if the
economic adjustment programme were compromised by Treasury disbursements.
Mr Marclio Marques Moreira, economy minister, said he had agreed merely to
re-allocate some government resources to social programmes, such as housing.
