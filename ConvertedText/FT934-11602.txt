FT  30 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Spring Ram shares dip as Masco talks break
down


   By CATHERINE MILTON


SPRING RAM said yesterday that Masco Corporation had withdrawn from bid
talks after the kitchens and bathrooms group, where changed accounting
policies recently revealed heavy losses and gearing, told the US building
products company its price range was too low.
Shares in Spring Ram dropped 4 1/2 p to close at 55 1/2 p - little more than
a third of the year's high of 146 1/2 p but above its recent 40p low.
Mr Roger Regan, chairman, said: 'They did not make an offer. The price they
were thinking of was too low.' He said he valued the company more highly
than the Americans: 'At that point Masco decided that their ambitions to buy
the company at a bargain price would not be fulfilled so they continued
discussions about other issues.'
Mr Regan said Masco made a number of products such as taps and valves which
Spring Ram might buy and that co-operation on fabric design was possible.
He said the board was now concentrating on the future: 'We are just getting
on with the hard work we have got to do on our organisation, getting our
marketing effort sorted out and things of that sort.
Masco Corporation declined to comment.
