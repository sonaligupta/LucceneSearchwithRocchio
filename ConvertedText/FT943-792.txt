FT  27 SEP 94 / Survey of Mauritius (10): A strong stayer - Profile: Sir
Aneerood Jugnauth


Sir Aneerood Jugnauth can boast one of the most remarkable records of any
leader of a multi-party democracy.
Prime minister since 1982, he has fought and won no less than four
elections. By 1996 he must face the voters again, and conventional wisdom in
the island is sceptical about his chances.
History, however, suggests that the 64-year-old Crown Counsel - he was
called to the bar in 1954, after reading law at Lincoln's Inn - should not
be underestimated.
'Some analysts and political commentators have already sounded the death
knell of the Jugnauth government and predict that the prime minister will
have to call an early election.' That assessment could well have been
written today; it was inm fact, written in 1989. Sir Aneerood confounded the
experts and critics, and won the 1991 poll.
Aloof on public platforms, he can be a different personality when on the
stump: but persuasive and articulate as he talks to the grass roots voters,
and as shrewd a political leader as Mauritius has known.
After a spell in the civil service and serving as a distrcit magistrate, Sir
Aneerood (he was knighted in 1988) was first elected an MP in 1963, and took
part in the constitional talks in London in 1965 that led to independence.
His first ministerial job was the development portfolio, and in 1971 he
joined the Mouvement Militant Mauricien (MMN). Elected as an MMM legislative
assembly member in 1976, he led the party to an overwhelming victory in the
1982 elections.
After a split in the party he formed the Mouvement Socialiste Mauricien,
which he leads to this day. In his early years as leader Sir Aneerood, a
member of the island's majority Hindu community, was in the shadow of the
country's first prime minister, Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam. But he
established himself as a formidable leader in his own right after successive
general election victories in 1983, 1987 and September 1991.
As the driving force behind the Mauritian economic success story, the
transformation of the island's economy will be his enduring legacy,
irrespective of the outcome of the next poll.
