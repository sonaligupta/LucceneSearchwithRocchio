FT  26 MAY 93 / International Company News: Saurer advances 68% to SFr21.4m

SAURER, the Swiss textile machinery and motor components group, said net
income jumped 68 per cent in 1992 to SFr21.4m (Dollars 14.54m), due to
improved operating results and the consolidation of new businesses.
Turnover more than doubled to SFr1.81bn following the consolidation of the
German Schlafhorst textile machinery group and the US metals company, Xaloy.
Textile machinery accounted for three-quarters of turnover.
At the operating level, the group turned round from a SFr85m loss to a
SFr55m profit.
Mr Melk Lehner, the chief executive, said the textile division operating
result improved by some SFr140m, mainly as a result of cost-cutting.
The motor components division, which makes transmissions for special
vehicles, reached break-even last year and would benefit this year from the
devaluation of the Italian lira.
Mr Lehner said the group was still aiming to acquire a 15 to 20 per cent
stake in Rieter, the Swiss textile machinery company. It now holds 14 per
cent.
Rieter said in a letter to shareholders in April that it intended to remain
independent.
