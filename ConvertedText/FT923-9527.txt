FT  05 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Germany's industry appeals for barter
cover


   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES

GERMANY's leading industry and trade associations yesterday appealed for
federal guarantees to cover barter trade deals with Russia and eastern
Europe.
'We are looking for new ways of doing business with the east in the '90s,'
said Mr Gerhard Reckel of the BGA foreign traders' association. The classic
trading formula - goods for money - would no longer be effective in the
foreseeable future.
Barter would become increasingly important, but there was no federal
mechanism comparable with the Hermes export credit insurance agency to
protect German companies.
The appeal for new support from the BGA along with the Federation of German
Industry (BDI) and the national trade and industry chamber (DIHT) will be
discussed with the finance and economics ministries next week.
According to the BGA, trade with Russia and former Soviet Republics fell a
further 25 per cent to 30 per cent in the first five months of this year.
Almost all business now being transacted was between German companies and
their subsidiaries in the east.
In 1991, German exports to the former Soviet Union fell 35 per cent to
DM18.2bn (Pounds 6.2bn) and imports dropped 20 per cent to DM14.6bn.
The associations claimed that barter guarantees had advantages in that banks
would not need to be involved, and that eastern trading partners were less
likely to renege on agreements than with credit deals.
Defending their claim for state aid, they pointed out that Mr Jurgen
Mollemann, economics minister, who has promised to develop but has yet to
unveil a new eastern trading strategy, admitted that his plans would 'cost
money'.
'One thing is clear. Without subsidies there will be no trade at all with
the east in the next few years,' Mr Reckel said.
