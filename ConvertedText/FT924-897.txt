FT  22 DEC 92 / International Company News: Total wins gas auction


   By WILLIAM DAWKINS


   PARIS


TOTAL, the French oil and gas group, has won control of more than 20 per
cent of the Hungarian gas distribution market.
The group won a sealed bid auction against other western oil companies for
two of Hungary's five state-owned gas distributors, Egaz and Kogaz, which
supply the west of the country.
The price is confidential, but the deal gives Total control of deliveries of
70,000 tonnes of liquefied gas a year. The other five distributors have been
sold to the Dutch group Pamgaz, which operates as Primagaz.
Hachette, the French publishing group, and CEP Communication, a publisher of
business journals, yesterday sold Le Nouvel Economiste, a loss-making
business magazine for FFr60m (Dollars 11.22m) in the latest change of
ownership in the French press industry.
The buyer is Capital Media, a privately owned publisher of specialist
magazines which will invest another FFr60m into the venture. Le Nouvel
Economiste was 65 per cent owned by Hachette and 35 per cent by CEP
Communication, a subsidiary of the Havas media group.
