FT  05 JUN 92 / Kenya aims to rescue economy

KENYA, its economy in turmoil, unveiled a budget yesterday aimed at
restoring confidence and winning back foreign aid suspended last November
because of economic mismanagement and failure to democratise.
Professor George Saitoti, vice-president and minister of finance, told
parliament he proposed to reduce the deficit for the year ending June 1993
to 2 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) from 3.5 per cent at present
and 6.5 per cent last year.
This is to be achieved through stricter spending controls and limited
revenue raising measures. For the first time, Prof Saitoti acknowledged the
need to cut numbers in the bloated civil service and speed privatisation.
Prof Saitoti said Kenya would move toward import parity pricing and variable
duties on agricultural commodities, lowering of import duty rates,
marginally reduced individual and company taxation and more export
incentives.
Western donor organisations and governments suspended aid worth an annual
Dollars 800m seven months ago to pressure Kenya into radical reform of its
heavily centralised economy, notably its costly state companies or
parastatals.
The budget acknowledges the severity of the problems facing Kenya, which
recorded its first negative per capita income growth in eight years last
year, and seeks to resolve the fiscal and policy problems which led to the
donors' radical action last year.
Prof Saitoti, said economic growth had slumped in 1991 to 2.2 per cent (a
real per capita income decline of 1.3-1.8 per cent), down from 4.3 per cent
in 1990, primarily as a result of drought, low coffee prices and a squeeze
on public-sector imports forced on the government after donors cut off quick
disbursing balance of payments support worth about Dollars 30m (Pounds
16.6m) a month.
Prof Saitoti announced a slight balance of payments improvement because of a
26 per cent growth in export earnings, caused by a surge in non-traditional
manufactured exports, a squeeze on public sector imports and bilateral debt
reschedulings.
