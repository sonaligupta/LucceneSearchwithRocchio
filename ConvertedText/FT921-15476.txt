FT  10 JAN 92 / US wholesale prices down

US WHOLESALE prices fell last month, indicating that inflationary pressures
are continuing to abate, the Labour Department reported yesterday, writes
Michael Prowse in Washington.
The producer price index for finished goods fell 0.2 per cent in December
compared with November, and by 0.1 per cent in the year to December.
Financial markets had expected no change in prices last month.
The annual decline in the index for finished goods was the first since 1986,
when a halving of oil prices temporarily depressed inflation.
Prices for crude and intermediate goods - products at an earlier stage of
production - fell by 11.6 per cent and 2.6 per cent respectively last year,
indicating that a further moderation of factory gate prices is likely.
Analysts said the apparent absence of inflationary pressures increased the
Federal Reserve Board's scope to combat recession by cutting interest rates.
