FT  30 JAN 92 / UK Company News: WH Smith sees CDs as growth area


FORTUNES were rather mixed at WH Smith, which saw buoyant sales in its high
street bookstores countered by a sluggish performance at its Our Price
Records stores, where turnover was hurt by the downturn in recorded music
sales. Although the drop there was due in part to the recession, there was
nevertheless a marked improvement in music sales over the Christmas period,
which was not such a profitable time for the book business.
Sir Simon Hornby, chairman, expressed optimism that with CD penetration in
the UK only at 31 per cent, the prospects were bright for growth in recorded
music sales. There was still some resistance to the high price of CDs, but
moves were being taken to introduce lower price ranges, which should help
stimulate sales.
Sir Simon said that the deal agreed with Virgin Group in September, whereby
WH Smith would buy a 50 per cent stake in Virgin's retailing operations, was
close to being finalised.
The Virgin megastore format complements that of the typical Our Price
Records store, which tends to have considerably less floor space than the
10,000 sq ft of a typical Virgin megastore.
The group has similarly rosy visions for its DIY joint venture with Boots,
which has been battered by the severe price cutting of its principal
competitors.
The product range has been substantially improved, Sir Simon contends, and
Do It All is set to become the number two DIY business in the UK.
