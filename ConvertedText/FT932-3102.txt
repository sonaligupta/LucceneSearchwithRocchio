FT  16 JUN 93 / Chairman attacks long work hours


   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff


THE MALE culture of long, unsociable working hours is damaging women's
career prospects, says Sir Christopher Tugendhat, chairman of Abbey
National.
The message was echoed by Mr John Collins, chairman and chief executive of
Shell UK, who said that 'jackets over chairs' for 18 hours a day could
indicate that a company was working inefficiently.
Men in the UK work longer hours than males in any other part of the European
Community, according to research by the Equal Opportunities Commission.
Nearly 42 per cent of men work more than 46 hours a week, compared with 23
per cent in the EC as a whole.
In a speech on equal opportunities Sir Christopher plans to deliver to the
Industrial Society's women's network tonight, he is due to say: 'Up till
now, the workplace has been predominantly male-oriented. There has been a
perception that to succeed one has to be tough, to work long and erratic
hours, and to be willing to travel, to stay away from home, to move house
and even sometimes country.
'These requirements have tended to favour the hiring and promoting of men
rather than women.'
Mr Collins, who has just joined the board of Opportunity 2000, the
employer-led campaign to improve the position of women in the workforce,
said: 'I don't want to encourage a culture where people are rushing around
trying to achieve too much to the detriment of the quality of their work.
That starts with the chairman - I don't work weekends.'
