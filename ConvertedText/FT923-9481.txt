FT  05 AUG 92 / Letter: Saturation in satellite market


   From Mr JAMES W BEAUMONT


Sir, Having spent more than 11 years at MBB making satellites, among others
Intelsat VI, I feel your article 'Europe's satellite makers are knocked out
of orbit' (July 31) leaves a great deal to be desired. MBB has made the
solar panels for almost all of the Intelsat satellites made by Hughes &
Ford. British Aerospace has also been a very large contributor, because the
UK was number two financial contributor to Intelsat, after the US.
The simple truth is that the satellite market is reaching saturation and the
US, funded by the American debt, has built a gigantic satellite capability
which is desperately seeking new markets. I suggest that the US
manufacturers will be steeped in red in the not too distant future.
