FT  16 NOV 93 / BA rises to Pounds 172m as traffic picks up


   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent


BRITISH Airways yesterday reported a sharp rise in second quarter pre-tax
profits from Pounds 136m to Pounds 172m, helped by cost-cutting and some
recovery in traffic.
Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chairman, said there were 'signs of recovery in our
two major markets, the UK and the US'. But he warned: 'Trading conditions
overall this winter will remain difficult as a result of over-capacity in
the industry,
For the six months to September 30, pre-tax profits rose 3.5 per cent to
Pounds 235m. Operating profits were nearly 30 per cent ahead at Pounds 344m
on a 14.1 per cent increase in turnover to Pounds 3.29bn.
But the company suffered Pounds 32m of losses largely from its French and
German regional airline operations.
Mr Robert Ayling, BA's managing director, said its French partner, TAT, was
about to launch a programme to reduce costs and improve the airline's
profitability.
Passenger numbers increased 12.1 per cent to 15.4m in the first half. But
with a slightly higher rise in capacity, the airline's passenger load factor
slipped 1.8 percentage points to 72.8 per cent.
The relative weakness of sterling improved yields and first and business
class premium traffic showed some strengthening in the second quarter with
an average 2 per cent growth over last year. However, Mr Ayling said the
main growth in the first half had come in economy class travel.
Sir Colin stressed the importance of increasing efficiency. BA's target this
year was to achieve savings of Pounds 150m. 'We have already identified
savings of over Pounds 100m. This added to savings over the last two years
of more than Pounds 400m means that we will have taken more than half a
billion pounds of costs out of our company over a three-year period.'
He said BA was leading the way in forming a global airline system with its
partners in the US, Australia and Europe. This was likely to lead eventually
to a rationalisation of the partners' fleets, particularly in the commuter
and regional turbopropeller aircraft sector.
Shareholders will receive an interim dividend of 3.18p a share, up 8.5 per
cent.
Fully diluted earnings per share were 0.5 per cent down at 20.4p, reflecting
last May's Pounds 442m rights issue.
Gearing stood at 51 per cent at the end of the first half showing an 11
point improvement since the end of March.
