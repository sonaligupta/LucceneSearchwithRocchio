FT  05 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls as
investors adjust to new index

   TOKYO


SHARE prices plunged on late afternoon arbitrage trading, and the Nikkei
average fell 2.2 per cent, closing below the 19,000 level for the first time
in eight months, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-share index ended 431.45 down at the day's low of 18,949.79, having
risen to a high of 19,433.24 in the morning. Selling centred on Nikkei 225
stocks which had not been included in the new Nikkei 300, and the Topix
index fell less sharply, by 17.79, or 1 per cent, to 1,604.08. In London the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.90 to 1,277.58.
Analysts expect further selling of Nikkei 225 stocks as investors shift
positions to the new index. 'There is more than Y1,400bn in outstanding
arbitrage buying positions, of which 60 per cent is held against the Nikkei
225,' said one fund manager.
Volume came to 230m shares, against Wednesday's 206m, and falls overwhelmed
advances by 902 to 118, with 142 issues unchanged.
East Japan Railway came under selling pressure along with other railway
issues, and fell Y3,000 to Y492,000. Keisei Electric Railway shed Y92 to
Y892 and Tokyu Y42 to Y730.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone closed Y11,000 lower at Y829,000. Other
telecom issues were also weak, with KDD slipping Y200 to Y12,400.
Margin traders who had bought stocks at higher levels six months earlier
were forced to liquidate holdings. Tokyo Electric Power declined Y50 to
Y3,390 on margin-linked selling, as did Sumitomo Metal Mining, Y27 lower at
Y803.
Nikkei 225 components not adopted for the 300-issue index fell back, Mitsui
Mining by Y29 to Y513 and Toagosei Chemical by Y36 to Y469.
Financials, which held up against overall selling during most of the day,
eased just before the close. Sakura Bank lost Y10 to Y1,690 and Nikko
Securities Y20 to Y1,160.
In Osaka, the OSE average declined 250.08 to 21,239.69 on selling by margin
traders, in volume of 19.1m shares.
