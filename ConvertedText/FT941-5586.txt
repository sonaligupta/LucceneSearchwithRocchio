FT  05 MAR 94 / UK Company News: US advance helps lift Cookson 59% to Pounds
95m


   By PAUL TAYLOR


Strengthening US markets, particularly in the final quarter, helped Cookson
Group, the specialist industrial materials company, to report a 59 per cent
increase to Pounds 95m in pre-tax profits for 1993.
The results compared with restated profits of Pounds 59.9m and highlighted
the refocusing of the group over the past few years under Mr Richard Oster,
chief executive.
Earnings per share rose by 51 per cent to 12.1p (8p) and the proposed final
dividend is lifted 10 per cent to 3.3p, making a total of 6.3p (6p).
The shares gained 13p to 266p.
Cookson's electronic materials and plastics businesses, both of which have a
large presence in the US, led the advance with operating profits up 63 per
cent and 48 per cent respectively.
Turnover increased by 16 per cent to Pounds 1.43bn (Pounds 1.24bn) including
Pounds 759.3m from the US.
Mr Oster said the market growth experienced by the group in the US and east
Asia during the first half of 1993 continued and, in some markets,
strengthened in the second half.
Commenting on the outlook, he said: 'So far in 1994, market conditions
remain similar to those experienced in the last quarter of 1993. The US
continues to perform strongly in most areas, the UK is improving and
continental Europe appears, on the whole, not to be getting any worse'.
The disposal of non-core businesses added about Pounds 7.9m to the pre-tax
result. Excluding these gains, and the effects of currency movements,
pre-tax profits increased by 34 per cent. At constant exchange rates
turnover increased by 5 per cent and operating profits were 18 per cent
higher.
Overall, operating profits grew by 32 per cent to Pounds 110.5m (Pounds
83.4m), which helped lift the return on sales to 7.7 per cent (6.7 per
cent).
Electronic materials contributed Pounds 36.7m (Pounds 22.5m) to operating
profits while plastics provided Pounds 19.7m (Pounds 13.3m). The ceramics
division was flat at Pounds 34.7m (Pounds 34.4m) while engineered products,
buoyed by the US-based precious metals business, improved to Pounds 19.4m
(Pounds 13.3m).
Net interest costs declined to Pounds 23.4m (Pounds 27.2m).
Following the successful Pounds 185.6m rights issue a year ago and the sale
of some non-core businesses, year-end gearing dropped from 76 per cent to 28
per cent.
