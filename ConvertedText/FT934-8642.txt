FT  15 NOV 93 / EU bankers urge settlement reform


   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor


EUROPEAN Union central bankers have agreed to try to reduce the risks of
banking system failures by ensuring that banks settle large cash payment
claims against each other immediately.
A working group of bankers led by Mr Tomaso Padoa-Schioppa, the
newly-appointed chairman of the Basle committee on banking supervision, a
committee of the Bank for International Settlements, has recommended that EU
states should establish real-time settlement systems 'as soon as feasible'.
Banks in most EU countries currently settle net obligations to each other
through central banks at the end of each day. However, this is thought to
carry risks of systemic financial failure.
Most EU states are working on a move towards 'real time gross settlement'.
Britain is planning to convert its interbank payments system from net end of
day settlement to real time by the end of 1995.
The report recommends that the net settlement systems which continue should
meet strict standards. These could raise the costs of these systems close to
those of real time systems, and so reduce the incentive to keep them.
The report also says that only central banks and credit institutions should
be allowed to participate directly in the transfer of funds.
