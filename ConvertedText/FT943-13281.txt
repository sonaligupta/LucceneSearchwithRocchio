FT  20 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Exco shares jump to 199p on first day


   By SIMON DAVIES and TIM BURT


Shares in Exco, the money broker, jumped 14 per cent on their first day of
trading, closing at 199p - compared with the issue price of 175p.
The public share offer had been 3.2 times subscribed, and brokers suggested
stock market sentiment had substantially improved since the issue was
priced.
While stags will be extremely pleased, the administrator of the collapsed
British & Commonwealth group, which sold its 40 per cent stake in the
company, may be less so.
Analysts believe the company should make more than Pounds 48m pre-tax profit
in 1994, compared with Pounds 41.5m last year, which puts the shares on a
prospective p/e ratio of 8, and a yield of more than 5 per cent.
Some brokers described the issue as being launched at 'give-away prices',
but the backers had initially struggled to find institutions to take up the
issue.
The issue was launched in a sliding stock market, and there was limited
appetite for all new issues, particularly one tied to the volatile finance
sector.
Underwriters said they were surprised by the public response to the issue,
which may have reflected Exco's strong performance in the stock market
during the 1980's, before it was bought by B&C.
More than 5.85m shares were traded yesterday, suggesting demand from
institutions whose allocations had been substantially marked down.
Buoyant demand for Exco shares was mirrored yesterday by a successful first
day's trading for Yates Brothers Wine Lodges, which saw its shares surge 25p
above the 140p placing price, writes Tim Burt.
More than 220,000 shares were traded in what the company described as a vote
of confidence by institutions.
'It shows there's still demand in the new issues market for a company with a
good track record which is sensibly priced,' said Mr Peter Dickson, managing
director.
