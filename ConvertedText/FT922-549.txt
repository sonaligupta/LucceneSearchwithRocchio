FT  26 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Wellcome sale could raise about Pounds 3bn


   By MAGGIE URRY


WELLCOME Trust, the medical charity, indicated yesterday it would sell 330m
shares in Wellcome, the drug company, in next month's international tender
offer. At yesterday's closing share price of 914p, up 1p, the offer would be
worth Pounds 3bn.
The prospectus, published yesterday, said the group expected pre-tax profits
and earnings per share for the year to August 31 to be 'significantly higher
than in the 1991 financial year'.
Analysts are forecasting profits of Pounds 500m to Pounds 510m and earnings
of about 36p per share. In 1991 pre-tax profits were Pounds 402.9m and
earnings per share were 29.3p.
Mr Lawrence Banks, head of corporate finance at Robert Fleming, the merchant
bank co-ordinating the global offer, said the 330m figure was conservative
and he was very confident there would be excess demand. He did not expect to
decrease the issue size.
Mr Roger Gibbs, chairman of the trust, said strong interest had been shown.
The provisional allocation gives 165m to the UK market, 80m to the US, 25m
to Japan and the remainder to be spread around the rest of the world. Within
the UK portion, Pounds 180m-worth of shares is being earmarked for the
public offer.
The company today starts presentations to investors in 29 cities. The
official tender process starts on July 6 and is expected to close on July
24. The UK public offer will close on July 21.
The tender price and basis of allocations should be announced on July 27
with dealings suspended for the first 1 1/2 hours of that trading day.
Mr John Robb, chief executive of Wellcome, said yesterday he would emphasise
five of the drug group's strengths to potential buyers. These included the
group's dominance of the growing anti-viral drug market, its promising
research and development pipeline and its emphasis on sales and marketing.
He also pointed to Wellcome's strong volume growth in sales, limiting the
effect of pricing pressures on drugs and the ability to increase margins.
Mr Banks said that retail demand was hard to estimate. So far more than
250,000 people had rung the Wellcome share information office.
Wellcome has about 23,000 individuals on its shareholder register, of which
10,000 are employees.
More than 80 regional stockbrokers are prepared to apply on behalf of
private investors, who can also participate via application forms. Existing
Wellcome shareholders with addresses in the UK will receive a special
application form giving them priority for up to Pounds 5,000-worth of
shares.
Retail investors have to offer to buy shares at the tender price being fixed
through the international book-building process. However as the tender price
will not be announced until a few days after the public offer closes
applicants must specify the value of shares they wish to buy, with a minimum
of Pounds 1,000.
The maximum number of shares that could be sold is 417m. The sale of 330m
shares would reduce the trust's stake from 73.5 per cent to 35.1 per cent.
The trust can increase the issue and Fleming has the option to sell a
further 15 per cent of the final size.
If the maximum 417m were sold, the trust would be left with 25 per cent,
which it says it would retain as a long term investment.
The trust will be paying total commissions of between 3 1/2 and 3 3/4 per
cent of the value of the shares sold.
