FT  20 JUL 94 / International Company News: Revenues at Lehman slide 22%


   By RICHARD WATERS


Lehman Brothers' net income sagged in its first period as a free-standing
investment bank, leaving it with a return on equity of just 2.8 per cent,
well behind what most other US investment banks are expected to report in
the coming days.
Lehman, which completed a spin-off from American Express during the second
quarter, blamed its poor performance in the period on the upheaval in
financial markets.
Revenues slid 22 per cent, to Dollars 696m, with the fall coming in dealing
and underwriting.
Net income was Dollars 20m, down from Dollars 95m a year before, although
Dollars 12m of the drop was due to a one-off after-tax charge associated
with the spin-off.
Mr Richard Fuld, chairman and chief executive, said the company had suffered
from lower underwriting volumes in equity and fixed income markets, as well
as less profitable trading with customers as a result of market volatility.
Investment banking revenues fell 27 per cent to Dollars 151m, revenues from
market-making and own-account trading dropped 17 per cent to Dollars 361m.
Commission income fell Dollars 2m, to Dollars 117m.
Bonuses were cut with a 24 per cent reduction in compensation and benefits
payments, to Dollars 364m. Total non-interest costs fell 12 per cent, to
Dollars 646m. Lehman's costs remain high relative to its competitors, and Mr
Fuld said cost-cutting was a priority.
