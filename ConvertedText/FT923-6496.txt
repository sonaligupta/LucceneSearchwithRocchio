FT  24 AUG 92 / TGWU and GMB unions set for formal merger talks


   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent


TWO of Britain's three largest unions, the TGWU and GMB, are expected to
begin formal merger talks this autumn in a move which could lead to the
creation of a 2m-strong organisation.
The talks, likely to be confirmed in September or October, would follow
months of merger speculation. They would be welcomed by employers who see
union amalgamations as a means of simplifying their collective bargaining
arrangements.
A TGWU-GMB merger would also raise further questions over the role of the
Trades Union Congress. The recent trend towards a smaller number of large
unions in the UK has already diminished the need for the TUC's co-ordinating
function.
Neither union could confirm the talks yesterday, but senior officials at the
TGWU are confident that leaders either of their union or the GMB will make
the first formal approaches after the annual trade union congress next
month.
Just a few months ago such a merger would have seemed impossible.
Traditionally the two unions, both of which represent workers in a range of
industries, have been rivals to recruit the same workers and this has often
led to friction. Links have strengthened considerably since the election
last year of Mr Bill Morris as TGWU general secretary.
This year the two unions have increasingly worked together, including on a
campaign to improve training. Earlier this year Mr Morris became the first
TGWU general secretary to visit a GMB annual conference.
A merger would be the latest in a series of amalgamations involving large
unions. Earlier this year the AEU engineers joined forces with the EETPU
electricians, and next year the Nalgo and Nupe public sector unions and the
Cohse health service union are due to form a 1.5m-strong organisation.
