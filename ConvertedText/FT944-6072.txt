FT  30 NOV 94 / Gauloise sell-off set for 1995

French state tobacco group SEITA, maker of Gauloise and Gitanes cigarettes,
is to be sold in the second half of 1995, if not earlier, budget minister Mr
Nicolas Sarkozy said yesterday. Mr Sarkozy said the government had adopted a
draft bill that would allow the sale of the 300-year-old monopoly whose
products are a special part of French culture. He said the legislation would
seek to safeguard the labour rights of SEITA's 6,000-strong workforce as
they would no longer be civil servants. SEITA's labour unions staged a
strike last month to protest against the privatisation plans. Mr Sarkozy
said it was possible that some of the shares would be earmarked for
employees.
Financial analysts said SEITA could be worth FFr7bn (Dollars 1.36bn). The
government is expected to retain a 10 per cent stake. French economy
minister Mr Edmond Alphandery announced last week that Credit Lyonnais had
been appointed as the state's adviser. SEITA could even be sold before the
1995 presidential elections in the spring. A successful sale of the
profitable company, coming after the sale of part of carmaker Renault, could
boost the ruling conservative coalition's chances.
