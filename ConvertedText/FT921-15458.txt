FT  10 JAN 92 / Arts: Today's Television


   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY


Television is into the retro business in a big way, re-cycling material
which was not at the top of the popularity stakes in its own day, but was
always cultish and has maintained a dedicated fan following ever since. BBC2
begins its evening schedule with an episode from Thunderbirds, the 1965
series in which Captain Troy Tempest and International Rescue fought the
cold war in a puppet version of James Bond.
That series (6.00) seems to appeal to the same sort of eternal teenagers who
love 'Flash Gordon' and also Doctor Who which follows on at 6.50. This
particular story, a 4-parter, is set in 1066 but was also made in 1965 with
William Hartnell, the original, starring as the time-travelling doctor.
Then at 8.00 BBC1 begins a 'new' series which had its genesis in 1973. Grace
And Favour is a new title but the cast (Mollie Sugden, John Inman, Frank
Thornton, Wendy Richard) starred in 'Are You Being Served?' Set in a
department store, this sitcom featured Mrs Slocombe's famous pussy and
Inman's catchphrase 'I'm free'. In the new series they are running a country
hotel instead of a shop. Expect little that is otherwise different.
