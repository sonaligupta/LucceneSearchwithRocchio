FT  29 JUL 92 / International Company News: Income leaps at USX thanks to
tax refund


   By MARTIN DICKSON


   NEW YORK


USX yesterday reported a return to profit by its US Steel subsidiary, the
largest steel manufacturer in the US, as the metals and energy group
reported a jump in consolidated second-quarter net income from Dollars 25m
to Dollars 232m, helped by a big tax refund.
US Steel made operating income of Dollars 45m, and net income of Dollars 6m,
or 10 cents a share, compared with losses of Dollars 32m, Dollars 39m and 79
cents respectively in the second quarter of last year. The figures were
broadly in line with analysts' expectations.
US Steel is the first major US steel manufacturer to report a return to
profit since the recession of 1991, but few, if any of its rivals, are
expected to follow suit until later this year.
A downturn in US demand and global over-capacity have kept steel prices
extremely weak while many US manufacturers are still carrying out costly
modernisations.
Mr Charles Corry, chairman of USX, said its steel operat-ions were
benefiting from modernisation, and cost reductions, but prices remained
severely depressed, mainly due to subsidised and dumped imports.
Second-quarter shipments were up 7 per cent from a year ago, but were only
modestly above the first quarter. Shipments were expected to remain flat in
the third quarter.
USX, which last year split its shares into two units, one for its steel
business and one for its energy side, reports the two divisions' results
separately.
Its USX-Marathon energy business recorded second-quarter net income of
Dollars 226m, or 79 cents, compared with Dollars 64m, or 25 cents, in the
second quarter last year. Sales dipped from Dollars 3.5bn to Dollars 3.2bn.
The Marathon group's operating income was Dollars 191m, just Dollars 10m
higher than a year before. The figures included a Dollars 119m tax refund, a
Dollars 98m non-cash revaluation reserve adjustment and a Dollars 115m
restructuring charge.
The bottom line jump was due mainly to Dollars 109m in net financial income,
against an Dollars 83m outflow a year ago. This was primarily the result of
interest on the tax refund.
For the six months, USX as a whole reported net income of Dollars 254m,
against a Dollars 212m loss.
