FT  02 JUL 92 / Purchasing index down


   By MICHAEL PROWSE


   WASHINGTON


THE purchasing managers' index fell sharply last month, adding to worries
that the fragile economic recovery is losing momentum, reports Michael
Prowse in Washington.
The index dropped to 52.8 per cent, compared with 56.3 per cent in May. Wall
Street analysts had expected a modest drop to about 55 per cent.
The index remains above 50 per cent and thus does not suggest the
manufacturing sector is contracting, but it points to a significant loss of
vigour and may heighten concern that jobs will not be created rapidly enough
to reduce the unemployment rate, now at a six-year high of 7.5 per cent.
The drop in the index left financial markets keenly awaiting employment
figures, due today, which will give the first comprehensive indication of
economic trends in June. If the figures are bad, many analysts believe the
Federal Reserve will be unable to resist calls for another cut in interest
rates, although it might delay action to avoid seeming to bow to political
pressure.
