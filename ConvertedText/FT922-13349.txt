FT  11 APR 92 / Steel output up 2.7% on year


UK STEEL output last month was 2.7 per cent higher than in March last year,
British Steel reported yesterday. It added that signs of an overall recovery
nevertheless remained muted.
The rise was caused largely by the need to boost stocks in anticipation of a
scheduled six-month rebuilding of one of the main blast furnaces at British
Steel's plant at Port Talbot in south Wales.
Output averaged 334,700 tonnes a week in March, 2.6 per cent down on
February. Production in the first three months of this year averaged 325,900
tonnes a week, 4 per cent higher than the 313,500 tonnes recorded in the
first quarter of last year.
