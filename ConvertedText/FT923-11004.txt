FT  27 JUL 92 / Hopes rise of early talks on Mideast

ARAB states and Israel are expected to resume peace negotiations in
Washington early next month after a meeting in Damascus at the weekend of
Arab foreign ministers endorsed an early resumption.
Mr Farouk al-Shara, the Syrian foreign minister, said the Arabs were ready
to resume bilateral talks 'as soon as possible'. In Jerusalem, officials at
prime minister Mr Yitzhak Rabin's office said they had not received any
formal invitation and expressed reservations about meeting at such an early
date. However they indicated they would accept Washington as venue for the
talks.
Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, who completed a Middle East tour
last Friday aimed at revitalising the peace process, had urged both Israel
and its Arab neighbours to bring forward talks.
He suggested the two sides should re-convene on August 10. Previously, they
had agreed to hold the sixth round of bilateral negotiations in Rome in
September, but the defeat of the hardline Likud government in Israel and its
replacement by the dovish Labour party prompted renewed efforts to
accelerate the process.
Israel and the representatives of Syria and Lebanon plus a
Jordanian-Palestinian team have held five rounds of desultory discussions on
issues of land and peace since the US-sponsored process started in Madrid
last October.
Syria, Lebanon and Jordan were represented in Damascus by their foreign
ministers. Mr Farouk Kaddoumi, head of the Palestine Liberation
Organisation's 'political department', represented the Palestinians. Also in
attendance was Dr Haider Abdel Shafi, the head of the Palestinian delegation
at the peace talks.
Dr Shafi is from the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip.
