FT  06 AUG 93 / Unions to set up RSI databank


UNIONS are to set up a central databank on legal action and settlement
levels in repetitive strain injury cases, the Trades Union Congress
announced yesterday at a conference with the Association of Personal Injury
Lawyers.
The TUC estimates that one in 10 workers could be affected by RSI. The term
covers a range of conditions affecting the shoulder, arm and hand which have
mainly been associated with manual jobs but are increasingly being
experienced by white-collar workers, particularly users of visual display
units.
