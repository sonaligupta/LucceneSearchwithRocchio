FT  27 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Dispute over EC tax on carbon


   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent


THE government yesterday rejected in its strongest terms yet proposals for a
European Community carbon tax.
Sir John Cope, the paymaster-general, said at a stormy Commons committee
meeting that 'the EC carbon tax along the lines proposed does not appear to
be in the UK's interest' and that the UK 'sees no need at this stage to
consider new taxes on energy'.
He added: 'After a year's discussion (between EC member states) it is clear
there is no consensus on a working basis (for the tax), and we should avoid
imposing excessive burdens on industry.'
Ms Clare Short, Labour MP for Birmingham Ladywood, said: 'We have seen a
deeply reactionary step today.' Labour found the EC tax proposals
'interesting, important and worthwhile' although further investigation of
their impact on poor families was needed.
The EC committed itself to curbing carbon dioxide emissions at last year's
Rio summit, but discussions on the tax, its only proposal for meeting the
targets, have been stalled by clashes between the energy policies of member
states.
The UK's resistance to an EC-imposed tax, which emerged in April when it
introduced its own taxes on motor and domestic fuel, has been described as
unhelpful by Commission officials.
Mr Andrew Warren, director of the Association for the Conservation of
Energy, said: 'This is going to mean an impasse for the EC which the next
presidency will have sort out.'
Mr Simon Roberts, an official of Friends of the Earth, the pressure group,
argued that energy efficiency measures could cut energy use in Britain's
buildings by 25 per cent.
