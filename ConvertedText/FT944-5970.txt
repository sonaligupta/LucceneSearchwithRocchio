FT  01 DEC 94 / The Budget: Investors warned of higher risks


   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY


Investors are likely to be faced with higher risks under the Budget's
venture-capital proposals, according to fund managers in Manchester, Ian
Hamilton Fazey writes.
They were also sceptical about whether Mr Clarke's proposals could work in
the long term, although up-front tax relief would attract investors.
'The headline figures astound me,' said Mr Peter Folkman, chief executive of
the Manchester-based North of England Ventures, which is backed by Schroder,
the merchant bank, and Rickitt Mitchell, the corporate financiers.
'We as an industry invest about Pounds 1bn a year in around 1,000 projects.
Less than half is genuine development capital or start-ups. Most are
management buy-outs. The problem is not finding money to invest in projects,
but in finding good projects to invest it in,' Mr Folkman said.
He added: 'The chancellor envisages an extra Pounds 2.5bn of venture capital
investment over three years and a doubling in numbers of companies
supported. The proposals may prove very good for swelling venture capital
funds but may not yield the returns people hope.'
Mr Malcolm Edge, head of taxation for the north-west office of KPMG Peat
Marwick, said: 'The tax benefits of venture capital trusts look very
attractive - but people are going to have to choose their venture capital
fund manager very carefully.'
Mr Mike Masters, finance director of Trinity International Holdings, the
Chester-based regional newspaper publisher and a former senior manager with
the Royal Bank of Scotland, said: 'There are not enough worthwhile projects
around.
'There are plenty of projects, but venture capital managers have to look
hard to find good ones.'
