FT  15 DEC 94 / Arts: Arts Council bales out the beleaguered


   By ANTONY THORNCROFT


Lower ticket prices for performances of contemporary opera at Covent Garden;
financial life-lines for the beleaguered regional orchestras and theatres;
more English touring by the National Theatre and the RSC; and no grant for
KOSH, the dance company: these are the main decisions from the Arts Council
of England yesterday as it announced the carve up of its 1995-96 grant.
The council unexpectedly received an extra Pounds 5.1m in the Budget, a rise
of 2.75 per cent to Pounds 191.1m. It had been told to plan on standstill
funding and had passed the same message to its clients. In the event, that
is just what the majority of grant-aided arts companies can expect next
year: frozen subsidy. The additional money has been used to ensure that few,
if any, companies go under before lottery funding starts to come through in
April.
The five regional orchestras and 16 theatres, including those in Farnham,
Birmingham, Salisbury, Harrogate and Cheltenham, were facing worryingly high
deficits. The council has decided to give the orchestras an additional
Pounds 450,000 between them (on condition that they match this sum by their
own efforts) while the theatres will share Pounds 565,000. The money comes
with the understanding that they must sort themselves out financially once
and for all.
Some national companies have been given special treatment. Hard pressed ENO
is getting Pounds 300,000 more, at Pounds 11.955m, to invest in new
productions, while Opera North is baled out with Pounds 200,000 more, to
Pounds 4.834m. English National Ballet is near breaking point and has had
its grant raised by Pounds 300,000 to Pounds 3.9m while Northern Ballet
Theatre gets Pounds 125,000 extra at Pounds 1.225m.
High seat prices at Covent Garden are a perpetual worry. The council cannot
afford to increase its across the board subsidy but is advancing another
Pounds 300,000, making Pounds 8.8m, to ensure that the Royal Opera can
reduce prices to help fill seats for contemporary opera.
The London orchestras face a difficult future: two, the LSO and the LPO, are
on frozen grants while the RPO and the Philharmonia must make do with just
Pounds 20,000 more each to help their regional work in Nottingham and
Bedford. The KOSH loses its grant for artistic reasons, but can apply for
touring money. In contrast DV8, the Place and Dance Umbrella get sizeable
lifts in subsidy, while Royal Ballet receives Pounds 100,000 more, at just
over Pounds 6m, to be invested in choreography.
The secretary general of the council, Mary Allen, said yesterday 'I
sincerely hope that no one now goes to the wall.' Prior consultation
suggests that most companies are happy. And with the council lottery fund
growing to Pounds 9m in just three weeks, the assumption is that any arts
company in a parlous state will have put in a well argued bid for some of
this cash.
