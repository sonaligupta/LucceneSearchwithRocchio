FT  20 JUL 94 / International Company News: Digital restructures sales and
support units


   By MARTIN DICKSON


   NEW YORK


Digital Equipment, the struggling computer manufacturer which last week
announced plans to cut 20,000 jobs, has announced a new structure for its
core computer systems division. The plan involves turning all but its top
1,000 largest customers over to third-party sales and support organisations.
Mr Enrico Pesatori, named last week to head the division, said Digital
served about 8,000 customers, but the 1,000 largest accounts made up some 75
per cent of the group's revenues.
He said the transition would be orderly and he expected customers to be
better served.
Mr Pesatori, who has headed sales and marketing and personal computer
operations, said the new division would consist of three worldwide business
units, each with profit and loss responsibility.
One is the company's PC division, which is to be headed by Mr Bernhard Auer,
who headed the company's European PC business.
A new systems business unit, which will be temporarily headed by Mr
Pesatori, will make Alpha workstations and client server systems and sell
them through partners.
An accounts business unit, headed by Mr Vincenzo Damiani, president of
European operations, will concentrate on sales to the top 1,000 accounts.
