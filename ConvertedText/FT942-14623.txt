FT  19 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Storehouse hit by sellers


   By PETER JOHN, CHRIS PRICE, CHRISTINE BUCKLEY and STEVE THOMPSON.


High street retailer Storehouse was hit by the departure of another senior
executive, which prompted a sharp fall in the shares and a change in stance
from a number of brokers. Analysts said the resignation of the Mothercare
division chief executive was a particular blow, given the impressive
performance by Ms Ann Iverson in improving the baby and children clothes
business, which is seen as one of the group's key growth areas over the next
few years.
One stores analyst said: 'Any senior resignation like this is bound to make
people jumpy, but with Storehouse it seems to be becoming a habit.' The
group has had four finance directors since 1989 and three chief executives
since 1988. The shares retreated 11 to 218p with turnover a hefty 9.2m.
Among those shifting stance on Storehouse was Hoare Govett which went from
'undervalued' to 'hold', recommending investors turn their attention instead
to Sears. Coincidentally, Sears, together with Next, were being mooted as
potential bidders for Laura Ashley, the fashion retailer which last week
lost its chief executive. Analysts said that such a move would cost in the
region of Pounds 285m and had the drawback of inheriting Laura Ashley's
troubled US business. The takeover talk kept the shares of all three groups
steady, with Laura Ashley slipping a half-penny to 79p, Next improving a
penny to 238 1/2 p and Sears remaining at 126 1/2 p.
