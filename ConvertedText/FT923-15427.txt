FT  02 JUL 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report


   By REUTER


BASE METAL prices on the LME closed mixed as technical reactions against the
recent uptrend hit some markets. Dealers said the continued absence of
significant fundamental developments left many markets looking overbought,
although buying support was eventually attracted by price dips. Three-month
COPPER slid to a low of Dollars 2,400 a tonne against a background of news
that Poland's government hopes to avert a copper mine strike. But chart
support and caution as Asarco labour talks are still taking place prevented
a breach of this level. Nymex PLATINUM futures returned to session peaks at
midday after the largest labour organisation in South Africa threatened a
general strike for August 3, sparking worries that mine production will be
disrupted in South Africa, analysts said. London COCOA futures extended
recent gains as origin sellers continued to stay away. A test of Pounds 600
a tonne is now expected for the September contract. New York raw SUGAR
futures were lower in all months at midday as concerns over supply tightness
continued to dissipate after Tuesday's expiration of the July contract.
