FT  22 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Globalisation still a route to
sustainable success


   From Mr MARK H J RADCLIFFE


Sir, Bronwen Maddox, in her article 'Masters of a fragmented universe'
(October 17), says globalisation is now only being heard of from a handful
of industries. That this is so is less to do with flawed acquisition
strategies than to do with a failure to conceive and implement effectively.
There are dozens of industries where sustainable success, and financial
return, will only be ultimately achieved by those who can get their global
act together.
The reasons for some industries being susceptible to globalisation and
others not range from the need to recover high R&D or tooling costs (eg,
pharmaceutical and automotive), the utilisation of special knowledge or
servicing skills (eg, international plant construction and maintenance, or
advisers such as auditors), or brand recognition and quality assurance (eg,
McDonald's).
We need to encourage and not discourage those businessmen with the vision,
courage and capability to do it, rather than taking a narrow, comfortable
and parochial route.
