FT  14 APR 94 / MoD settles Airwork dispute


The Ministry of Defence said yesterday it had settled its latest dispute
with Airwork, a military maintenance company based in Birmingham, over the
unsatisfactory execution of a contract to upgrade Hercules transport
aircraft.
It said flaws in the company's work, identified four months ago, had been
ironed out and the contract would be properly completed next month, with no
extra cost to the ministry.
The problem over the Hercules was the second between Airwork and the
ministry.
The latest dispute is seen as an embarrassment to the government at a time
when it is proclaiming the need to increase efficiency by making greater use
of civilian contractors.
