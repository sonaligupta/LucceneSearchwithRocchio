FT  05 AUG 92 / Money Markets: Futures drop further


STERLING futures again performed bearishly as the pound showed renewed
weakness against the D-Mark on the foreign exchanges.
After opening at 89.69, the September short sterling contract dipped 6 basis
points in the morning, shadowing the pound's drop to a low of DM2.8350 in
European trading. In the late afternoon, the contract declined even further,
to close at 89.61, as sterling weakened to DM2.8325 in New York.
The December short sterling contract, after opening at 89.81,slipped a net
six basis points to a low of 89.74 in the morning. By the close, it had
rallied slightly to 89.75.
Dealers again had mixed views about the extent of the bearishness. One
clearing bank dealer said the fall in the September contract was
insignificant, considering the low volume of trading.
A commercial bank dealer, however, said the bearish mood had been underlined
by uncertainty over sterling's position in the European exchange rate
mechanism and a call by the chairman of Abbey National, the British mortgage
lender and retail banking group, for the government to give tax relief to
people who sell houses at a loss.
Rates in the sterling cash market were slightly softer after the Bank of
England forecast a small shortage of Pounds 300m. The fall in short-dated
money fed through to the longer dates.
For most of the day, one-month money was offered at 10 1/8 per cent, after a
previous close of 10 3/16 per cent, and three-month money was down to 10 3/8
per cent from 10 7/16 per cent. But the three-month offered rate tightened
to 10 5/16 per cent in the late evening as sterling fell in New York.
In its discount market operation, the Bank of England dealt in only Band 2
bank bills at the established rate of 9 7/8 per cent. In the morning it
purchased Pounds 10m and in the afternoon Pounds 11m. There was late
assistance of Pounds 220m.
Eurolira futures rallied significantly yesterday after the Bank of Italy cut
its official discount rate by  1/2 percentage point to 13.25 per cent on
Monday night. The September Eurolira contract opened at 85.66, up 19 basis
points from its previous close, and then climbed to finish at 85.93 for a
day's rise of 46 basis points.
