FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Government Statements): Diesel vehicles win tax
concessions - Company Cars and Fuel


The chancellor proposes in his Budget:
to introduce a separate scale with lower tax charges for diesel fuel
provided for private motoring in company cars;
to increase the existing fuel scale charges for taxing petrol broadly in
line with inflation;
to increase the scale charges for taxing employees on the value of the
private use of company cars broadly in line with inflation.
The changes will take effect from April 6 1992.
The chancellor also proposes to introduce price-based scale charges for
company cars as soon as practicable. The Inland Revenue will be publishing a
consultative document on this change in the summer.
Implementation
The new scale charges will take effect from April 6 1992. PAYE codes
containing an adjustment for car and car fuel benefits will be reviewed and
amended individually to reflect the proposed scale charges. Employers and
employees will be notified of the revised codes, which will generally take
effect on the first pay day after May 17, 1992 at the same time as the
increases in personal allowances are implemented.
A company car driver, paying basic rate tax, and driving a 1600cc car less
than four years old travelling between 2,501 and 17,999 business miles a
year will pay about Pounds 13.32 a week in tax for the car, compared with
Pounds 12.74 in 1991-92.
If petrol is provided for private motoring in that car, there will be a
further Pounds 3.03 a week in tax compared with Pounds 2.88 in 1991-92. But
if diesel fuel is provided the weekly tax will be reduced to Pounds 2.21. In
all these cases the increased tax payable will be offset by other reductions
in income tax.
The Inland Revenue cannot identify cars using diesel fuel from their current
data. Those employees whose codes contain an adjustment for car fuel
benefits will have their code changed to reflect the increase for non-diesel
fuel.
Those who think they qualify for the lower charge for diesel fuel should
contact their tax office.
Future structural change
The chancellor proposes that the current car scale structure which is based
for most cars on their engine size, but for some on their original market
value, should be replaced by a structure based wholly on the price of cars.
This will remove some of the distortions in the current structure and allow
a fairer measure of the value of the benefit of private use of a company
car. VAT changes
The chancellor proposes two changes in the VAT treatment of cars.
From April 1, 1992, VAT will no longer be charged where a deduction is made
from an employee's salary in return for the provision of a company car. This
will meet the complaint that charging VAT discriminates against companies
wishing to offer their employees a choice between a company car and salary.
However, where payment is actually made by the employee for his or her own
use of a company car, VAT will still be due on that payment.
From August 1, 1992, private taxi and self-drive hire firms and driving
schools will be able to recover the VAT they pay on cars purchased for their
businesses.
While this will enable such firms to recover their input tax, subject to the
normal rules, they will have to account for output tax on any actual private
use, and on the eventual sale of the car by the business.
Motor mileage allowances
The Inland Revenue has announced the 'tax-free' mileage rates they will use
in the Fixed Profit Car Scheme (FPCS) for 1992-93, the tax year starting on
April 6, 1992.
The FPCS is an administrative arrangement for taxing motor mileage
allowances paid by employers to employees who use their own cars for work.
National Insurance
contributions
The changes to the income tax on company car and car fuel charges for the
tax year 1992-93, proposed by the chancellor, will be used to calculate
employers' Class 1A National Insurance contributions for that year. These
contributions will be payable in June 1993.
Since April 6, 1991, employers have been required to pay Class 1A National
Insurance contributions on the benefit of cars and car fuel they provide for
the private use of employees. Liability is assessed on an annual basis using
income tax company car and car fuel scale charges.
Fuel scales
The chancellor proposes to change the scales applied for income tax purposes
to business fuel used for private purposes. In line with these proposals,
the fuel scales used for charging VAT will be amended via the Value Added
Tax (increase of consideration for fuel) Order 1992.
The new scales will take effect from April 6, 1992. Businesses will become
liable to use the new scales from the start of their next accounting period
beginning on or after that date.
The provisions covering fuel scale charges are set out in Section 9 and
Tables A and B of Schedule 6 of the 1986 Finance Act and came into force on
April 6 1987.
Under these provisions a fixed charge - related to three bands of engine
size - is payable in respect of VAT due on fuel used for private motoring.
This enables the business to recover the whole amount of VAT charged on the
purchase of the fuel and avoids the need for detailed mileage records to be
kept by the business.
This simplified procedure was introduced following an extensive consultation
exercise with businesses. Many representations suggested that the Inland
Revenue income tax scales should be adopted for VAT purposes.
The VAT fuel scales are a simplified procedure authorised by EC derogation
from the provisions of the Sixth VAT Directive, which provides a uniform VAT
structure for all Member States.
The proposed changes will yield Pounds 5 million in 1992-93 and Pounds 5
million in 1993-94.
