FT  06 JUN 92 / Money Markets: Cash rates firmer


CASH rates in the sterling money markets were firmer yesterday as the market
grew concerned about sterling's poor performance on the foreign exchanges.
A large shortage of Pounds 1.1bn forecast by the Bank of England in its
money market operations also ensured that it was an expensive day in the
cash markets.
Sterling's  1/4 pfennig descent on the foreign exchanges down to DM2.9150
checked the view that another base rate cut will soon be signalled by the UK
authorities. Dealers feel that the difficulties over the progress of
European Monetary Union (Emu) leave sterling's position uncertain. And while
the Danish and Italian currencies have also been hit hard by these
uncertainties this week, their central banks have been forced to respond by
raising short term lending rates.
Period rates in the cash market were therefore firmer across the board.
1-month money ended the day at 9 15/16 per cent, up  1/8 on Thursday's
close. 3-month libor, often seen as a key indicator of how rates will move,
also ended  1/16 per cent up on the day at 10 per cent. However, one year
money was unchanged at 9 15/16 per cent.
The less optimistic view on rates was partly the result of the large
shortage forecast by the Bank of England at the start of the day, which
contrasted markedly with the small ones earlier in the week.
In the morning, the Bank of England purchased Pounds 76m of Band-1 bank
bills at 9 7/8 per cent and Pounds 132m of Band-2 bank bills also at 9 7/8
per cent.
The shortage was later revised to Pounds 1.2bn. The Bank later purchased
Pounds 42m of Band-1 Bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent and Pounds 18m of Band-2
bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent. In the afternoon, the Bank purchased Pounds 3m
of Band-1 Treasury bills at 9 7/8 per cent and Pounds 286m of Band-1 bank
bills also at 9 7/8 per cent. The overnight rate closed for the weekend at
11 per cent.
Trade in sterling futures also reflected the sterling gloom. The September
short sterling contract dropped 8 ticks on the day, closing at 90.19. This
reflects the view that 3-month libor will be at 9.81 per cent in four months
time.
The December contract ended at 90.45, down 5 ticks. This reflects the market
view that 3-month libor will be at 9.55 per cent at the end of this year.
