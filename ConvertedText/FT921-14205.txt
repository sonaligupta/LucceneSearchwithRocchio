FT  17 JAN 92 / Algerian leader returns from exile: Boudiaf gets hero's
welcome after 28 years abroad


   By FRANCIS GHILES


MR MOHAMED BOUDIAF, Algeria's new head of state, returned to Algiers
yesterday, from 28 years' exile in Morocco, to a hero's welcome.
The 72-year-old veteran of Algeria's independence war, sentenced to death in
1964 by his own country for political activity, will head the five-man High
Council of State, set up following the resignation of President Chadli
Bendjedid on Saturday and the cancellation of a second round of elections.
The poll was widely expected to have catapulted the fundamentalist Islamic
Salvation Front into power.
The first man to welcome him was Gen Khaled Nezzar, the defence minister and
a key member of ruling council.
'As in the past, I promise the Algerian people that I will give all my
efforts to guarantee their prosperity and to serve them,' Mr Boudiaf said on
arrival yesterday.
All three parties that won seats in the first round of the now aborted
elections - the FIS, the National Liberation Front and the Front des Forces
Socialistes - continue to describe the events of the past few days as
unconstitutional. However, none of them appears, to be prepared to risk
challenging those now ruling the country with more than words.
The parties have held meetings over the past two days, apparently aimed at
co-ordinating their response towards the new council - which has made no
promise as yet so far to hold elections of any kind.
The FIS has pledged to oppose the new leadership legally. In a communique
issued after Mr Boudiaf's arrival, it called for calm and patience, telling
its militants to avoid provocation.
The FIS has accused the authorities of starting to arrest its members. There
has been no official confirmation of this.
