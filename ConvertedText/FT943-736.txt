FT  28 SEP 94 / Quebec cabinet appointed


   By ROBERT GIBBENS


   MONTREAL


Mr Jacques Parizeau made another strong pitch for a separate Quebec, after
being sworn in as the province's 26th premier. The separatist Parti
Quebecois won the September 12 election with 77 National Assembly seats,
against 47 for the federalist Quebec Liberals. But the vote was almost
evenly split. Mr Parizeau, 64, said he would now prepare for a referendum on
sovereignty by the end of 1995 as he announced his 19-member cabinet in
Quebec city. Mr Parizeau appointed an old friend, Mr Jean Campeau, 63, a
former president of the Caisse de Depot, the public pension plan manager, as
finance minister, and Mr Bernard Landry, 57, a key minister in the 1976-84
PQ government, as deputy premier and minister for international affairs. Mr
Paul Begin, PQ vice president and a strong separatist, was named as justice
minister, Mrs Louise Beaudoin as inter-governmental affairs minister and Mr
Daniel Paille, a former vice president of the Quebecor international
publishing and printing empire, as minister of industry and commerce.
