FT  28 APR 94 / 300 jobs to go at GM joint venture


   By JOHN GRIFFITHS


About 300 jobs - 13 per cent of the workforce - are to go at IBC Vehicles
joint venture between General Motors and Isuzu of Japan which makes the
Vauxhall/Opel Frontera four-wheel-drive leisure vehicle and Midi panel vans,
John Griffiths writes.
The job losses, intended to be voluntary, reflect falling demand for the
Midi van and what the company yesterday said was a continuing need for
productivity improvements.
They will mean that IBC's workforce, based at Luton, Bedfordshire, will have
fallen by about 500 since early last year. The plant employs 2,250.
However, rising demand for the Frontera means that plans to move to
single-shift working from the double day shift system have been dropped.
About 80 per cent of IBC's output is exported and the Midi, in particular,
has been hit by one of the worst slumps in Continental Europe's commercial
vehicles market since the second world war.
The company said the job reductions were also being caused in part by plans
to produce a greater proportion of Frontera Sports, the 'small' version of
the Frontera which requires less manpower than larger, five-door versions.
