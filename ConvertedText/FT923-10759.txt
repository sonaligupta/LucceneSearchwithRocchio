FT  29 JUL 92 / Leading Article: VAT compromise


COMPROMISE IS an inescapable consequence of membership in the European
Community. Those who belabour Mr Norman Lamont over his acceptance of
legally binding minima in EC indirect taxation should recognise that fact or
call for the UK to leave the EC.
Criticism needs to focus not on the fact of compromise, but on whether this
particular compromise - painful, beyond a doubt - was worth making. It was.
The gain, the abolition of customs frontiers from the beginning of next
year, is worth the pain.
Nevertheless, the pain is not negligible. The US example demonstrates that
minimum rates of indirect tax are not needed for a single market. Loss of
autonomy is particularly painful in the case of taxation, the heart of
parliamentary sovereignty. This is also a disturbing precedent, since
extension of fiscal harmonisation to direct taxation could undermine the
ability of EC governments to set competitive tax rates.
Nonetheless, the agreement is worthwhile. By accepting the 15 per cent
minimum rate on VAT, as well as the minima on excise duties, Mr Lamont has
ensured that customs barriers will be dismantled. He has achieved this
without changing any of the UK's tax rates; he has avoided discriminatory
increases in excise duties on whisky elsewhere in the EC; and he has ensured
that agreement on the minimum rate to be applied from 1996 will require
unanimous consent.
Achievement of the single market, a longstanding ambition of the UK, is
worth the price. But one cannot ignore the lesson. Member states are loath
to accept actions by others that compromise their ability to pursue
traditional goals. In an EC whose member states are strongly committed to
high levels of public spending, subsidiarity is subject to severe
limitations. The agreement on indirect taxation provides a cogent example.
