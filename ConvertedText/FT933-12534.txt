FT  23 JUL 93 / Church of England managers censured for losses


   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent


THE Church of England's investment managers came under serious criticism
yesterday for policies which led to the loss of more than Pounds 800m in the
value of their assets over three years.
A report by accountants Coopers & Lybrand says a decision by the Church
Commissioners to speculate heavily in property, particularly in large retail
schemes, left them exposed in a sector with a 'high inherent level of risk'.
The property market slump was largely responsible for a fall in the capital
value of assets from nearly Pounds 3bn in 1989 to Pounds 2.16bn last year.
Property represented 60 per cent of total assets in 1990.
The dent in the church's finances will force parishes to meet a far greater
share of its running costs and provoke early changes to a non-contributory
pension scheme for clergy.
Yesterday's report was commissioned by Dr George Carey, archbishop of
Canterbury. Criticism of the commissioners responsible for the Church of
England's main investments followed an investigation by the Financial Times.
The Coopers & Lybrand report also criticises the handling of asset
management. Several large property developments, it says, had been adversely
affected by 'poor project control procedures, disregard for external
professional advice and inadequate internal reporting structures'.
The fall in income will have severe implications for the Church of England.
An accom-panying report published by the Lambeth Group, a committee set up
under the chairmanship of the Rt Rev John Wayne, bishop of Chelmsford, to
consider the Coopers & Lybrand recommendations, says the level of
contribution by the commissioners to the cost of pensions, stipends and
housing 'cannot be maintained'.
