FT  28 SEP 94 / Councils shake-up finds scant backing


   By JOHN AUTHERS


Consultative referenda held in 10 counties by the Local Government
Commission have revealed strong opposition to government plans to
restructure local government in England.
The government wants to replace the two-tier system of counties and
districts with all-purpose unitary councils.
All households in the areas concerned were sent consultation leaflets. The
response rate ranged from 4.3 per cent to 15.5 per cent.
In eight of the 10 counties covered - Cambridgeshire, Cheshire, Cumbria,
Hampshire, Kent, Lancashire, Leicestershire, and Oxfordshire - maintaining
the two tiers, at least for part of the county, was the favourite option.
Unitary options were only preferred in Bedfordshire and Berkshire, where
local politicians were in favour of change and the status quo was not an
option presented.
In Cumbria and Cambridgeshire the status quo was the most popular option,
although it was not formally proposed by the commission.
Commissioners, who meet today to finalise their recommendations for these
counties and for Buckinghamshire, say they will not be bound by the results
of the polls, which were not formal referenda.
But Sir John Banham, commission chairman, has said that no recommendations
for change would be made unless the commission has evidence of overwhelming
public demand.
The cross-party Association of District Councils said the results should not
form a serious part of the commission's decision-making in view of the low
response rate. The process had been 'corrupted' by biased county council
publicity campaigns, it said. In Chester 27 per cent of the 4,400 letters
received by the commission 'could be traced to Cheshire County Council and
its staff'.
It criticised county information campaigns in Oxfordshire, where 70 per cent
favoured the status quo, and Lancashire, where 60 per cent favoured the
status quo.
The status quo was the most popular option in Blackburn, represented in
parliament by Mr Jack Straw, Labour's local government spokesman, who
supports unitaries.
The Labour-controlled Association of County Councils said that district
councils had also campaigned heavily. Mr Ian Swithenbank, chairman of the
association's policy committee, said: 'The argument for change is not borne
out on the basis of these results.'
Majorities were registered for giving unitary status to the cities of
Portsmouth, Plymouth and Leicester, while keeping two tiers for the
surrounding areas.
In Bedfordshire a three-unitary system proved most popular, meaning
all-purpose authorities for Luton, Bedford and Mid-Bedfordshire, while in
Berkshire a plan to create five unitaries proved marginally more popular
than two options presented by the commission to create four.
