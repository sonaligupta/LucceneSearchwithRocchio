FT  05 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Tiles cost-cutting helps lift Norcros to
Pounds 15.6m


   By JANE FULLER


THE BENEFITS of cost cutting in its ceramic tile factories helped to offset
a sharp deterioration in windows and doors at Norcros last year.
Pre-tax profit rose 4 per cent to Pounds 15.6m (Pounds 15m) on reduced
turnover of Pounds 394m (Pounds 425m) in the 12 months to March 31. A
decline of 7 per cent in operating profit to Pounds 24.3m (Pounds 26.2m) was
outweighed by reductions in exceptional charges and interest costs.
The better-than-feared results and hopes of further progress helped the
share price gain 17p to close at 148p. A maintained final dividend of 3.5p
leaves the total unchanged at 7p, just covered by earnings per share of 7.5p
(7p).
Mr Michael Doherty, chief executive, said: 'We have completed our
restructuring and now we are going to start growing.' Operating profit per
employee had risen by 11 per cent.
In ceramics, including Johnson tiles in Stoke-on-Trent where 1,500 jobs have
been shed, operating profit rebounded by 74 per cent to Pounds 11.4m (Pounds
6.53m) on sales of Pounds 121m (Pounds 118m). Apart from a 30 per cent
profit improvement in the UK, there were turnrounds in Australia and South
Africa.
Profits also advanced in print and packaging, where the group is involved in
niches such as films and tickets. The division made Pounds 12m (Pounds
10.4m) on sales of Pounds 98.6m (Pounds 97.2m).
But building products profit fell by nearly Pounds 10m to Pounds 3.56m on
sales of Pounds 156m (Pounds 184m).
Mr Robert Alcock, finance director, said the big disappointments were Crosby
Sarek, the windows and doors maker, which incurred a 'significant' loss, and
Crittall Windows, which fell into the red. These had wiped out good
performances from Triton showers and Crosby kitchens.
Gearing remained high at 91 per cent on net debt of about Pounds 128m
(Pounds 147m). More than Pounds 17m had come in from property sales, with a
further Pounds 22.5m since the year-end. Mr Alcock said a Pounds 60m
portfolio remained - most of it should be sold this year.
Meanwhile the activity has been shoved below the line, making it the main
contributor to a Pounds 4.69m extraordinary charge.
COMMENT
A big sigh of relief was heaved yesterday at evidence that the expensive
years of closing factories, shedding workers and capital spending were over
and that some benefits were at last coming through. However, the slide in
building products showed that cutting costs is not a panacea. Crosby Sarek
still needs a 10 per cent volume increase to break even. With further
benefits to come from cost-cutting and lower interest payments, even a small
pick-up in demand should send this year's pre-tax profit to between Pounds
20m and Pounds 25m. In spite of yesterday's rally, the prospective p/e of
roughly 15 is lower than many recovery stocks in the building materials
sector, and the print and packaging wing is no detraction. But excitement
about recovery prospects should be tempered by the property portfolio and
the related high gearing; and by some caution about the outlook for house
building and, even more so, for commercial building. Supported by a 6.3 per
cent yield, the price should have a bit more room for improvement.
