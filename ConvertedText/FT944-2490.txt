The Japanese prime minister, Mr Tomiichi Murayama, will visit Washington
early next month for talks with President Bill Clinton, the government
announced yesterday. The visit will be Mr Murayama's first to the US since
he became prime minister last June. Bilateral trade relations, including the
unresolved issue of trade in cars and car components, are expected , once
again, to be the principal focus of the discussions. Mr Kozo Igarashi, chief
cabinet secretary, hinted that the timing of the trip, in the year that
marks the 50th anniversary of the end of the second world war, was as
important as its substance. Mr Murayama will be accompanied by the foreign
minister Mr Yohei Kono and the deputy chief cabinet secretary, Mr Hiroyuki
Sonoda.
