FT  21 APR 94 / Irish bank governor appointed


   By TIM COONE


   DUBLIN


The Irish government has stuck to tradition and appointed a career civil
servant to succeed the central bank governor, Mr Maurice Doyle, who steps
down at the end of this month. He is Mr Maurice O'Connell, 57, currently
second secretary at the Department of Finance, responsible for its finance
division. Mr Doyle announced last month that he did not intend to seek
reappointment for a second seven-year term, and it had been speculated that
the government might choose someone from outside the civil service.
Mr O'Connell is considered a leading expert on the European monetary system
and central bank legislation. He is a member of the EU Monetary Committee
and a director of the European Investment Bank.
