FT  16 MAR 94 / Observer: Zebra crossed


Not everyone hates Britain's motorway cones. Footballers like to use them to
practice their dribbling.
Indeed, Newcastle United has become so attached to the cones at its Durham
training ground that it has just had them kitted out in the club's colours.
Apparently, the Department of Transport's regulation red and white strip for
its motorway cones is identical to the colours of United's rivals -
Sunderland.
So United's manager Kevin Keegan turned to club vice-president, Tom Brown,
for help. When Brown is not watching United, he's chairman of
Northumberland-based RTM Group, which supplies cones and contra-flow
cylinders for motorway contractors.
No sooner had Keegan blown the whistle than Brown had paid Pounds 1,000 to
have his team's 50 red and white cones recovered in different colours so
they wouldn't clash with United's black and white team strip.
