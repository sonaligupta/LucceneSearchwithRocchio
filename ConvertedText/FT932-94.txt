FT  30 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Birkby calls for Pounds 9m to fund buy


BIRKBY, which is involved in the provision of managed workspace, vehicle
hire and instalment credit, is calling for Pounds 9.2m, partly to fund the
acquisition of Hill Hire, a specialist in the hiring of heavy commercial
vehicles.
The rights issue, of 7.17m new shares, is on a 1-for-2 basis at 135p. It is
underwritten by Charterhouse Tilney.
Birkby, which reversed into Finlan Group last August, also announced pre-tax
profits of Pounds 1.1m for the year to March 31. As the results included the
Birkby businesses for eight months they were not directly comparable with
previous restated losses of Pounds 4.32m.
Turnover amounted to Pounds 11.7m (Pounds 19.5m). Earnings per share came
through at 11.7p (1.2p losses) and a proposed final dividend of 2.53p makes
a total of 3.53p.
Mr Michael Woodhead, chairman, said that Finlan's two remaining trading
businesses, Witting Brothers and New Range Systems, had had a difficult
year.
Hill Hire is being acquired for an initial Pounds 4m in cash and Pounds
500,000 in shares. Further consideration, up to Pounds 2m, is profit
related. In the six months to March 31 it made pre-tax profits of Pounds
424,000.
In addition to funding the acquisition, proceeds from the rights issue will
be used to provide further working capital for the expansion of all the
group's main divisions.
