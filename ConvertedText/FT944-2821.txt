FT  15 DEC 94 / International Company News: Court ruling likely next week on
BAT bid


   By RODERICK ORAM


A judgment is likely next week on the Federal Trade Commission's attempt to
block the Dollars 1bn takeover by BAT Industries of the UK of American
Tobacco, writes Roderick Oram.
The New York city court hearings concluded yesterday after 10 days of
testimony. Judge Milton Pollack will rule before Christmas, lawyers involved
in the case said.
The FTC argued that the takeover would strengthen BAT's third position in
the US market, reducing competition and making it easier for the industry to
raise prices.
BAT argued the purchase would raise its market share from 11 per cent to 18
per cent making it a more effective competitor. Philip Morris leads with 46
per cent and RJR Nabisco is second with 28 per cent.
