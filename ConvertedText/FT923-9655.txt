retailers

COLES Myer and Woolworths, Australia's two largest retailers, have announced
improved sales for the latest financial year, against the trend of a
depressed retail sector.
The larger Coles Myer unveiled a modest 1.6 per cent rise in sales to
ADollars 15.18bn (USDollars 11.32bn) for the year to July 26, from ADollars
14.94bn a year earlier. This performance was easily surpassed by Woolworths,
part of the Adelaide Steamship group, with an 11 per cent advance in sales
to ADollars 9.18bn for the year to June 23, from a lower base of ADollars
8.27bn.
Woolworths, due to be floated by Adsteam later this year, also announced a
13.1 per cent rise in earnings before interest in tax to ADollars 247.0m
from ADollars 218.4m. Coles Myer's earnings will be announced on September
10.
Mr Paul Simons, Woolworths chairman, said all divisions had improved market
share with sales growth ahead of inflation. He said the supermarket
division, the company's core business, had raised its national market share
to 30.22 per cent from 28.66 per cent.
Mr Peter Bartels, Coles Myer chief executive, said the company's sales
increase would have been 3.9 per cent excluding New Zealand businesses -
mainly Progressive Enterprises - which were sold during the year. But he
warned that profit margins were still under considerable pressure from
widespread discounting. A performance breakdown showed that the fourth
quarter was by far the strongest, with Australian sales increasing 6.5 per
cent to ADollars 3.64m from ADollars 3.42m.
Bridge Oil, an Australian oil and gas producer, yesterday reported that
production fell 2.7 per cent to 5.08m barrels of oil equivalent in the first
half to June 30, from 5.22m barrels a year earlier, AP-DJ reports. Revenue
from petroleum sales fell 6.5 per cent to ADollars 84.5m in the six months,
from ADollars 90.4m in the year-earlier period.
