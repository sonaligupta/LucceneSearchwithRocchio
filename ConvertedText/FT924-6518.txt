FT  20 NOV 92 / Letter: Growth of the independent financial adviser


   From Mr KEVIN MCBRIEN


Sir, Lex's view ('Tide against agents', November 16) that life company tied
agents have caused the biggest headaches in the wake of the last Financial
Service Act may well be true of smaller tied agents. However, these need to
be differentiated from larger tied agents, such as some of the major
building societies.
These larger tied agents have not, as far as I am aware, warranted such
criticism from the regulators.
I would also query Lex's statement that 'the trend towards direct sales
forces shows no signs of slowing'. The market share I have before me shows
direct sales and home services companies with a combined share of 48 per
cent in 1990 and a very similiar 46 per cent at mid-1992 - an undoubtedly
considerable contribution to the total market.
Independent financial advisers, however, have seen their business increase
substantially and their market share go ahead from 32 per cent to 36 per
cent at end-June 1992.
These figures exclude executive and group pensions business for which there
is little reliable data, but their inclusion would have emphasised the trend
towards independent advice rather than diminished it.
Although my company deals exclusively through independent financial
advisers, none of the above should be construed as a criticism of properly
constituted tied agents or direct sales forces. I believe that each channel,
properly controlled, has its own considerable part to play.
But I do not subscribe to the view that the trend towards direct sales
forces shows no signs of slowing. It seems on the data that the feature of
the last couple of years, if anything, is the growing significance of
independent financial advice.
