FT  12 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: . . . while others offer sympathy


   From JANE JOHNSON and LINSEY MERCER


Sir, In response to 'Wimp of the species' by Michael Thompson-Noel, our
hearts bleed for him. Where was he in the fight for female equality?
Cowering behind the lines hors de combat with a bad back] Dr Farrell's book
could go down in history as the first categorised as 'social comment' and
'comedy fiction'.
We would suggest that, if men's magazines concentrated on giving men
'special outlets and incentives to express their feelings and perspectives'
rather than gymnastically arranged big-breasted women and Lamborghinis, the
book would be superfluous. In the game of life, women now find themselves
running with the ball, while men lie crumpled in their wake bleating 'high
tackle . . . off-side . . . bad back]'
It's a sad sign of the (financial) times that 20 column inches are expended
on male whittering.
