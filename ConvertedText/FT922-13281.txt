FT  13 APR 92 / UK Company News: Davis Service sells contract hire
subsidiary for Pounds 5.75m


   By ANGUS FOSTER


DAVIS SERVICE group, the business services company formerly known as Godfrey
Davis, has taken a further step away from its previous focus of vehicle hire
and dealership with the sale of its contract hire subsidiary for Pounds
5.75m.
Davis is selling Godfrey Davis (Contract Hire), which operates more than
11,500 vehicles, to NWS Bank, a subsidiary of the Bank of Scotland. The
price compares with a net asset value of Pounds 5.6m. The division reported
reduced profits after interest charges of Pounds 800,000 (Pounds 2.6m) in
1991 as clients reduced their fleets.
The disposal follows the sale last May of three of Davis' four Ford
dealerships. The remaining outlet is in St Albans, and the company has
expressed interest in selling that. Davis' other divisions are involved in
cleaning, work wear and site services.
