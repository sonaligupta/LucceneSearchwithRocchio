FT  16 DEC 94 / Swissair in Belgian talks to gain stake in Sabena

   BRUSSELS, LONDON


A radical change in the ownership of Sabena, the Belgian national carrier,
was on the cards last night as Swissair, Switzerland's national airline,
confirmed it was in discussions with the Belgian government.
In a move that would provide Swissair with a secure foothold in the European
Union's single aviation market, the airline's board of directors said it had
asked the executive management to take steps towards closer ties with
Sabena.
The board also stipulated the terms and conditions on which such a
relationship would depend, but would not confirm reports that it was aiming
for a 49 per cent stake in the Belgian carrier. 'These matters are currently
the subject of promising discussions between the two companies,' Swissair
said yesterday.
It now looks likely that Air France's 25 per cent interest in the Belgian
airline will be bought, either by the Belgian government or Swissair,
clearing the way for a deal to go ahead. Air France owns two-thirds of
Finacta, a Belgian holding company which has a 37.5 per cent stake in
Sabena. The Belgian state owns 51 per cent of Sabena.
Although the French carrier is thought to be reluctant to end its links with
Sabena, it has come under heavy pressure from the Belgian government to do
so, and is understood to be ready to discuss terms under which it would sell
its stake.
Mr Elio di Rupo, the Belgian communications minister, said negotiations
would start 'very soon'. The Sabena board meets today, and an announcement
could follow as early as next week.
In a letter to personnel, Mr Pierre Godfroid, the Sabena chairman said:
'Swissair wishes to acquire a significant shareholding in Sabena's capital
with a view to strengthening our shareholders' equity.'
Switzerland's main airline is desperate to find a base inside the EU so it
can take advantage of the deregulated single aviation market. It is also
worried that Switzerland's continued determination to remain outside the
Union has resulted in unfavourable treatment at key European hubs.
'Swissair feels a bit out in the cold,' said Mr Quentin Quarterman, an
analyst at Smith New Court. 'It finds it difficult to get new European
destination slots, especially in Italy.'
Pressure to find an entry into the EU increased after the collapse last year
of the so-called Alcazar plan to merge Swissair, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,
Scandinavian Airlines System and Austrian Airlines.
Sabena, which last year made losses of BFr4.5bn (Pounds 89m), has meanwhile
been seeking to pressure Air France into reducing or selling its minority
stake in the state-owned national carrier to enable the formation of a
partnership with another airline.
Sabena has long been seeking to forge new partnerships in an attempt to
strengthen its international operations. Both Swissair and Sabena have
code-sharing agreements with Delta Airlines of the US under which they link
their route networks on booking systems.
