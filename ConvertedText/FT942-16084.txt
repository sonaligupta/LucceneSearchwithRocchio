FT  12 APR 94 / International Company News: Sabena swings BFr4.5bn into red

Sabena, the Belgian airline, yesterday became the latest European state
carrier to swing into the red when it announced a BFr4.5bn (Dollars 127m)
loss for 1993.
The loss at Sabena, which is 37.5 per cent owned by Air France, followed a
BFr6m profit the previous year.
The airline said about BFr1bn of the deficit was due to one-off
restructuring charges and staff redundancies which had been carried out the
previous year.
It insisted that the results were 'in line with the the objectives of the
plan developed in 1993'.
The other components of the loss, the company added, had been:
a BFr1.5bn reduction in turnover due to a fall in the number of flights to
Africa, one of Sabena's main destinations, as a result of political turmoil;
a BFr1bn loss due to the devaluation of eight European currencies during the
monetary turmoil last year;
a BFr1bn drop in revenue due to price wars between European, US and Asian
airlines.
Although it admitted that 1994 would be a difficult year, the company
insisted that it remained optimistic about the future. The restructuring
plan had already begun to take effect in the second half of 1993. Prices had
been stabilising and passenger numbers rising, resulting in a record number
of passengers carried last year, it said.
The loss had been widely expected, with industry observers in Brussels
predicting a loss of between BFr4.4bn and BFr4.7bn.
However, analysts warned that the result was likely to raise questions about
Sabena's longer term future. The Belgian government has pursued a fairly
generous policy towards its state carrier, but attempts to provide fresh
state aid are likely to be opposed by the European Commission, they pointed
out.
