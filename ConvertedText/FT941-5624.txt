FT  05 MAR 94 / PowerGen mothballs generators


   By MICHAEL SMITH


PowerGen, the electricity generator, is to place one generating unit in
reserve at each of Richborough, Ince and Fiddler's Ferry power stations with
effect from the end of this month.
The company said the move would enable it to cut costs while retaining the
option to burn alternative fuels.
Under current operating conditions the affected units are forecast to have
minimal generation. Their withdrawal, the company said, would enable it to
make savings through reductions in maintenance costs, use of system charges
and business rates without affecting its ability to meet forecast demand.
Richborough and Ince are PowerGen's only plants where orimulsion, the
bitumen-based fuel, is burned - but the company said it would continue to
burn about 1.3m tonnes a year in the units still open at the sites.
The registered capacity of PowerGen plant available to the grid system as a
result of the move of the units into reserve will be reduced by 1,080
megawatts.
PowerGen said withdrawal of this plant would not prejudice the possibility
of these units being considered for disposal under the recent undertaking
given by PowerGen to Offer, the industry regulator, to use all reasonable
efforts to negotiate the disposal of about 2,000MW of its coal- or oil-fired
plant within two years.
When generating plant is put in reserve, PowerGen says, it is not available
for operational use. However, under certain circumstances it would be
possible to recommission it if future market conditions made it economically
viable to do so.
The Treasury will shortly appoint a merchant bank to advise on the sale of
some or all of its shares in the electricity generators National Power and
PowerGen, Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, said in a
written answer yesterday. Subject to market conditions, the sale would take
place in 1994-95.
