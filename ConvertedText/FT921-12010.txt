FT  29 JAN 92 / International Company News: Shareholders in Elkem tighten
grip

ELKEM, the troubled Norwegian metals producer, plans board changes which
will give the company's two biggest shareholders more say in management
decisions, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo.
Mr Kaare Moe, Elkem's chairman, is to be replaced by Mr Finn Jebsen,
president of Orkla, a Norwegian industrial company with interests ranging
from paper to branded food products.
Mr Jebsen currently holds a position on Elkem's board. He will be replaced
as a director by Mr Anders Eckhoff, a lawyer, representing Saga Petroleum,
Norway's biggest independent oil company. Orkla owns 30.2 per cent of Elkem
and Saga 12.4 per cent.
The board changes, already agreed in principle, are to be made formally at a
special meeting called for February 3.
At last year's nine-month interim, Elkem reported a NKr367m (Dollars 58m)
loss, before extraordinary items, against a NKr40m deficit previously. It
blamed difficult market conditions for its main products.
Elkem is currently reviewing measures to rein in costs, but last October
stopped producing manganese in Beuharnois, Canada, and implemented plant
closures in Norway.
Mr Jebsen said yesterday that the management changes would lead to closer
co-operation and co-ordination among the owners, the board and the corporate
management. He expected them to trigger an improvement in Elkem's operations
and future results.
Norsk Hydro, Norway's biggest stock market listed company, yesterday
rejected speculation that it is to merge with Elkem.
