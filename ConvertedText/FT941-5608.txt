FT  05 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Self-destruct landmines do not
guarantee protection


   From Mr NICHOLAS HINTON and Mr DAVID BRYER


Sir, The FT is to be congratulated for pointing out that landmines cause
carnage among civilians in many countries around the world ('Effort for
global ban on landmines', February 28). The review of the international law
governing the use of landmines, the UN's 1980 Inhumane Weapons Convention,
beginning in Geneva this week, presents an opportunity to protect future
generations of civilians from these terrible weapons.
The existing international law has numerous faults. It only seeks to
restrict the use of landmines, not their production and export. Restricting
use is an almost futile task once they are in the hands of most of the
world's combatants, especially given that there is no monitoring or
enforcement system. Further, existing law applies only to international
conflicts, when the great majority of anti-personnel mines are used in
internal conflicts.
Your article mentions that anti-personnel mines might be improved by adding
self-destruct mechanisms. We have grave reservations about an exception
being made for such devices. Self-destruct mechanisms are not foolproof.
Independent experts estimate that failure rates are likely to be about 10
per cent. Thus, a minefield originally containing 100 mines will still
contain 10 deadly mines. The land will still be a death-trap, unusable to
local populations.
And mine clearance operations will still be dangerous, expensive and
time-consuming, since it must be assumed that every mine is still armed. For
the first time in more than a decade, national delegations attending the
review process, including the UK delegation as observers, have the
opportunity significantly to tighten the present UN Convention to protect
innocent civilians. It would be a tragedy not to do so.
