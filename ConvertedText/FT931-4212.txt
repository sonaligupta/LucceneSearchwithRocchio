FT  11 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Willis Corroon warns of dividend cut as
profits slide


   By RICHARD LAPPER


WILLIS CORROON, the UK's largest insurance broker, warned that it will cut
its 1993 dividend after reporting a sharp fall in pre-tax profits from
Pounds 67.1m to Pounds 42.5m due to a Pounds 25.7m increase in provisions at
its Sovereign insurance subsidiary.
Willis declared an interim quarterly dividend of 1.65p, indicating that the
full year dividend could be cut by 50 per cent. A full year dividend for
1992 of 13.2p was declared three months ago.
Willis made a provision of Pounds 25.7m at Sovereign, as claims from
hurricane Hugo and other natural catastrophes from 1989, 1990 and 1991
continue to hit the company.
The company withdrew from the London commercial insurance and reinsurance
market in 1991. Additional pro-visions are also needed because some of the
company's reinsurers will not be able to meet claims.
'Some very serious problems are emerging. This is a very expensive baby to
put through school,' said Mr Charles Coyne, analyst with Credit Lyonnais
Laing.
Profit from brokerage and other ongoing insurance operations amounted to
Pounds 68.2m (Pounds 103.2m). Turnover rose to Pounds 607.2m (Pounds
577.3m), an increase of 1 per cent in underlying terms. Operating expenses
rose to Pounds 568.7m (Pounds 521m), or by 2 per cent in underlying terms,
partially reflecting increased expenditure on overseas acquisitions and an
expensive refurbishment at the company's Trinity Square headquarters.
Interest and investment income fell to Pounds 53.9m (Pounds 67.4m), as a
result of sharply lower interest rates.
COMMENT
Despite yesterday's news on the dividend front, there are still reasons to
be optimistic about Willis Corroon. The group should obtain benefit from the
stronger dollar, in which it earns about 40 per cent of its revenue, while
the strong performance by the Willis Faber & Dumas subsidiary, indicates
things are going reasonably well in the London market, despite very tough
trading conditions. Looking ahead though, more losses at Sovereign cannot be
ruled out, while lower interest rates will continue to depress investment
income. In the United States there is still no guarantee of a turnaround in
rating, while Corroon & Black has a lot of work to do to improve the rate at
which it is retaining customers.
Pre-tax profits could be pegged back to Pounds 60m this year. On yesterday's
closing price of 190p that puts the share on a prospective multiple of 20.
On balance, investors could well find better value elsewhere.
