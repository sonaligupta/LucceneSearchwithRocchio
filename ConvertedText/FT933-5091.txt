FT  06 SEP 93 / Nigerians killed in Somalia

   MOGADISHU


SEVEN Nigerian peace-keeping troops with the UN and at least 15 Somalis,
some of them women and children, were killed yesterday when a patrol tried
to shoot its way free of gunmen loyal to the Somali warlord General Mohamed
Farah Aideed, Reuter reports from Mogadishu.
Somali gunmen also captured two Nigerian peace-keepers in the worst attack
on the 25,000-strong UN army in Somalia since August 8, when four US troops
were killed in an ambush.
The Nigerians, who had been surrounded by angry Somalis along a city road,
were killed before they could retreat, residents said. Nearby Italian other
UN troops were reported as having been prevented from helping them by
burning barricades and mobs.
The latest attack raised the UN death toll to 46 since June 5, when Gen
Aideed's supporters killed 24 Pakistani UN troops at the start of a campaign
against UN control of Somalia's rehabilitation.
