FT  26 JUN 92 / International Company News: BP America to axe 600 jobs in
cost-cutting move


   By ALAN FRIEDMAN


BP of America, citing the impact of recession, said it plans to cut its US
operating costs by Dollars 125m by eliminating 600 to 700 jobs in its
corporate headquarters staff and refining and marketing divisions.
The job cuts, to be felt largely in the Cleveland, Ohio, region, where BP of
America is based, were presented as part of the British energy group's
programme of seeking Dollars 750m of cost reductions.
The new US cuts, which include the near halving of BP of America's
Cleveland-based corporate headquarters staff of 610 people, mirror the UK
head office job reductions announced in April. At that time, BP said it was
eliminating 700 of the 1,450 jobs from its head office at Britannic House in
London.
Beyond the 250 to 300 job cuts at it Cleveland headquarters, BP of America
also plans to eliminate between 375 and 500 refining and marketing jobs from
its BP Oil and BP Chemicals divisions in the US.
The US job cuts come less than three weeks after BP of America said it was
planning to dispose of assets in Florida and California, including more than
300 petrol stations and two distribution terminals. That decision marked a
turnround in BP's US strategy of building up its west coast network of
filling stations.
Last month, BP raised Dollars 314m by selling off its 56.94 per cent
shareholding in BP Canada.
After the new job cuts, BP of America will still have nearly 35,000
employees. Its 1991 turnover was Pounds 9.3bn (Dollars 17.2bn).
