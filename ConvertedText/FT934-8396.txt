FT  16 NOV 93 / Curb on Trident broadly welcomed


   By DAVID OWEN


GOVERNMENT plans to restrict the size of Britain's Trident nuclear deterrent
were broadly welcomed by MPs yesterday although some senior Tories sounded a
note of caution.
Sir Nicholas Bonsor, chairman of the defence select committee, said Trident
was a 'sane' place to look for defence savings.
But he said the move left questions about the number of missiles and
warheads the armed forces would have in reserve and on how easily the policy
could be reversed.
Sir Geoffrey Johnson-Smith, chairman of the Tory backbench defence
committee, said his colleagues would accept such a move provided it did not
come on top of other serious cuts.
Labour welcomed the move, which it said it had been advocating for the last
four years. 'If they had listened to us in 1989 we could have saved millions
of pounds,' it said.
But Mr David Clark, shadow defence secretary, said: 'The sad truth is that
this decision has been forced on the MoD by the government's financial
incompetence.'
Mr Menzies Campbell, Liberal Democrat defence spokesman, said it showed
'some belated commonsense'.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, will today announce the new policy,
under which the UK is to commit itself to deploying a force with a total
explosive power no greater than the present generation of Polaris ballistic
missile submarines. This could save hundreds of millions of pounds from the
defence budget.
