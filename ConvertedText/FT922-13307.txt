Results due
THE outlook for UK construction stocks should become clearer this week with
several major companies announcing final results for last year.
Recession in the housing and construction sectors are expected to take a
heavy toll, with provisions for property write-downs, losses and cut
dividends expected. But the market will also be looking for signs of
optimism, and will take its first early pointers on the outlook for UK
residential property especially.
John Mowlem, the construction group which also owns 90 per cent of London
City Airport, is expected to announce today pre-tax profits of Pounds 10m,
down by more than two-thirds. The company's scaffolding subsidiary had a
poor first half and a dividend cut is expected.
Taylor Woodrow, which has suffered badly from both the property and
construction recessions, is expected to do tomorrow no better than break
even (against Pounds 83.4m pre-tax profits a year earlier). Heavy
provisions, and possible write downs on its property portfolio, are
expected, although the dividend is probably safe.
RMC, the world's biggest cement maker which reports on the same day, is
unlikely to surprise tomorrow with pre-tax profits down one quarter to
Pounds 160m. Strong performance in Germany is likely to buffer the company
from a weak UK.
Tarmac, the UK's largest housebuilder, looks likely to cut its dividend when
it reports a plunge in profits on Wednesday to around Pounds 35m (Pounds
190.7m). The company is expected to make a Pounds 12m provision on the
Channel Tunnel, and a possible land write down.
Blue Circle Industries, the building materials group, announcing the same
day, is expected to be in much better shape and to limit profits fall to
Pounds 126m (Pounds 195m). The dividend should be maintained. Although the
UK's performance will be poor, there are hopes for signs of an upturn in the
US.
Smiths Industries, the aerospace and medical equipment maker, is expected to
turn in on Wednesday interim pre-tax profits of around Pounds 45m (Pounds
50.7m) and an unchanged interim dividend of 3.9p.
Investors will be keen to hear whether Smiths is closer to sewing up a
partnership agreement with Collins Avionics, a division of Rockwell
International of the US. Such a pairing would create a third force capable
of offering a full range of commercial aircraft avionics. The other two are
Honeywell of the US and Sextant of France.
The UK's struggling hotels will take the limelight on Wednesday when both
Forte and the Savoy Group report full-year results. Forte is expected to
announce pre-tax profits sharply down from 1990's Pounds 190m, with
estimates ranging from Pounds 73m to Pounds 78m. The Savoy could drop from
last year's Pounds 10.3m to Pounds 2m. This year should be much better,
particularly with the prospect of an upturn in business travel after the
decisive UK election.
