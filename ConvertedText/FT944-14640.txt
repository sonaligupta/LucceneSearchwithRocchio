FT  21 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: EU milk prices to stay under
pressure


   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES


European Union milk prices have been below 1993 levels this year and are
likely to remain under pressure in coming years because of the EU's
enlargement and trade liberalisation, according to Mr Erhard Richarts, head
of the dairy group at Germany's agricultural market and price reporting
agency ZMP.
Mr Richarts, speaking at a dairy conference this week organised by Agra
Europe, the business information group, said the lower prices in continental
Europe are in sharp contrast to rising levels in the UK as companies compete
for supplies ahead of deregulation in November. But he stresses that the
British situation has little to do with the development of the market in the
rest of Europe.
EU prices have fallen as export markets to third countries have shrunk amid
increasing competition from New Zealand and Australia.
Next year prices will be further depressed when Finland, Norway, Austria and
Sweden join the EU. These countries all produce milk surpluses - Finland and
Norway are far more self-sufficient than the rest of the EU.
In spite of applying milk quotas to the four new members, the EU's
structural surplus of dairy products will increase to about 1.1m tonnes when
they join.
In addition, when the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade deal comes into
effect in the middle of next year, greater access for dairy imports is
likely to push this surplus to 2m to 3m tonnes, Mr Richarts says.
He sees little political will for cuts in milk quotas among EU agriculture
ministers.
He expects prices to firm slightly in the first half of next year but to
weaken later with pressure on the European dairy market increasing in the
late 1990s as the Gatt deal bites.
