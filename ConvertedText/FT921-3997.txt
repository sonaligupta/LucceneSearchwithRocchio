FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Government Statements): Late payers of invoices
targeted - Debt Recovery


A PACKAGE of measures were announced to help tackle the problem of late
payment experienced by many small companies and to encourage businesses to
adopt the good practice of government departments in making prompt payment
to suppliers.
The government will require large companies to state in their annual report
and accounts how quickly they pay their bills.
Simpler procedures will be introduced for small claims and debt recovery
cases.
Prime contractors of government departments must include a clause in their
sub-contracts committing themselves to pay subcontractors promptly -
ordinarily within 30 days of receipt of a valid invoice.
In addition the Department of Employment will provide up to Pounds 90,000
for three trade associations to run one-year pilot schemes to provide 'late
payment hotlines' for their members.
The chancellor said the government had every sympathy with small companies
which found that their larger debtors were deliberately delaying payment to
boost their own cash flow.
Government departments had a good record in paying their own bills on time
and the government hoped the example it had set would be followed by large
companies throughout the private sector.
Company accounts. The government proposes to amend the Companies Act 1985 to
require large companies to state in their annual reports and accounts how
quickly they pay their bills.
Court procedures. Small traders who either sue, or are sued, for debts of
Pounds 1,000 or less will benefit from continuing improvements to the quick,
informal, 'do-it-yourself' small-claims arbitration procedure under which
the loser does not risk being required to pay the winner's legal costs.
