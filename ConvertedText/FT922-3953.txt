FT  09 JUN 92 / Jakarta struggles to control its deregulation: Indonesia's
test of economic management may have just begun


   By WILLIAM KEELING and REUTER


   JAKARTA


INDONESIA, a centrally controlled, bankrupt economy in the mid-1960s, has
emerged into the 1990s with a 20-year record of economic growth. However,
there are signs that the government, which is certain to be returned to
power in today's general election, is struggling to control the deregulated
economy it has fashioned.
Deregulation began in earnest in 1983, supported by the Asian Development
Bank and the World Bank and prompted by the collapse in crude oil prices.
With oil and gas accounting for 80 per cent of Indonesia's export revenue in
1982, the country was faced with a crisis.
The subsequent rise in non-oil-and-gas exports and imports reflects both the
success of deregulation and the problems the government must confront:
exports have risen from Dollars 5.9bn (Pounds 3.24bn) in 1984 to Dollars
17.6bn last year, but imports have shown a concomitant rise from Dollars
13.9bn to Dollars 23.4bn.
Oil and gas last year accounted for just 39 per cent of total export
proceeds, but the cost of change is reflected in a 180 per cent rise in
public external debt since 1983 to Dollars 50bn. Servicing public debt this
year is expected to cost Dollars 7.3bn, or about 24 per cent of total export
proceeds.
As a result, Indonesia relies on foreign aid to cover a current account
deficit which reached Dollars 4.48bn last year and which donors expect to be
Dollars 4.8bn in 1992.
Dr Radius Prawiro, senior economics minister, says the deficit 'compares
favourably with other developing countries. Our deficit of 3.5 per cent of
gross domestic product (GDP) compares with some 9 per cent for each of
Malaysia and Thailand.' He admits, however, that the deficit almost ran out
of control last year and would have been Dollars 8bn had the government not
stepped in to cool the economy.
The government's problem was that deregulation, particularly in the banking
industry, had prompted a surge in private sector activity. Domestic bank
credit grew 158 per cent between the end of 1988 and December last year to
Rp113,608bn (Dollars 56bn). Private overseas borrowing has increased from
Dollars 14bn in 1989 to Dollars 25bn.
The government acted to curb foreign borrowing last September when it
announced a review of state-related projects worth Dollars 79bn. The
government also set ceilings for new foreign borrowing for the banking
sector of about Dollars 2bn for each of the next five years. This followed a
tightening of money supply in February 1991. But the action was late and
with Indonesia already nudging credit ceilings on the international capital
market, unnecessarily strong.
Bank sector credit is only expected to grow 14 per cent this year. When a
forecast inflation rate of 8 per cent, down from 9.2 per cent last year, and
an expected 6 per cent depreciation of the rupiah against the dollar is
taken into account, real credit growth may even be negative. The tightening
of the money supply pushed lending rates up to 30 per cent. This in turn
increased company costs.
'Companies are very pessimistic,' says Dr Mari Pangestu, senior economist at
Jakarta's Centre for Strategic and International Studies. 'A lot of the
conglomerates expanded and diversified when there was a lot of money.
Perhaps the greatest concern after the high interest rate is a string of
company failures.'
Last year, two companies, Mantrust and Bentoel, reneged on debts totalling
Dollars 770m. The government has since relaxed money supply, but lending
rates have remained high at 24 per cent, not because of bank illiquidity but
because of a perceived high lending risk.
Banks are concerned that many loans made during the 1988-90 credit boom were
not invested efficiently. The central bank estimated bad and doubtful debts
of the banking sector in 1991 to be 5.9 per cent of total loans, up from 3.9
per cent in 1990.
Economists at donor agencies, however, say the bad debts of the five state
commercial banks which dominate the sector range from 15 to 25 per cent of
their portfolios, and that many banks are providing less than 1.5 per cent
of performing assets for bad debt. A worst-case scenario would see further
company failures exposing a critically weak banking sector.
But this is to discount the government's record of economic management and
the underlying dynamic of the economy, which, with new export-orientated
manufacturing production coming on stream, remains strong. The recent rise
in prices of crude oil should also improve export earnings.
Donors will be pushing for further deregulation to unleash growth,
particularly in the agricultural sector. Government ministers say that the
issue of private companies being given monopoly rights over certain farm
produce will be tackled within 12 months.
Two such companies are headed by children of President Suharto, which has
led to doubts over the political commitment to deregulation within the
administration. Government officials insist, however, that a further tranche
of tariff and trade deregulation is imminent.
The Asian Development Bank recently forecast GDP growth for this year at 6.7
per cent, the same as last year. The report stressed, however, that
'exploiting the country's considerable potential will require a continued
commitment to transforming the economy.' Raising per capita income,
estimated by the World Bank at Dollars 570, will be a slow task.
With consolidation among domestic banks and reduced credit on the
international capital market, future growth must come from increased
productivity. The government's test of economic management may have only
just begun.
Indonesia is ready to leave the ranks of the world's poor and nearly double
the income of its population by the end of the decade, the World Bank said,
Reuter reports from Jakarta.
However it is a formidable task and Jakarta must open up its economy, be
more efficient, improve local infrastructure and deal with a huge current
account deficit and foreign debt, it said in a confidential report obtained
by Reuters.
Foreign donors will have to continue large-scale aid, at least in the short
term, to help Indonesia pursue its widely-praised economic programmes.
