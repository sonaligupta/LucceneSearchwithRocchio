FT  27 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: UK equities


Talk of BP's possible dividend cut could scarcely have come at a worse time
for UK equities. The market is already bracing itself for British Steel's
cut to be announced on Monday. That may set other companies on the same
track, especially struggling ones in the financial sector or in capital
goods where the average dividend is already only just covered. Some of the
latter based their generosity in respect of 1991 on confidence in the
future, but with the prospect of a vigorous upswing ever more remote that
argument now rings hollow.
Perhaps the surprise in the response to BP was that the Footsie fell only 23
points yesterday. But, then, the index was already some 180 points below its
post-election high when the news struck on Thursday night. Some lowered
expectations for both dividends and earnings must already be discounted, and
on a longer-term perspective the market may now be cheap. It would not do to
assume that the slide has bottomed out, though. There may still be a case
for switching into defensive stocks like utilities. For the market as a
whole there are precious few short-run grounds to buy.
