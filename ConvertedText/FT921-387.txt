FT  30 MAR 92 / Jamaica to swear in new premier


   By CANUTE JAMES


   KINGSTON


MR Percival Patterson, a 57-year-old, London-trained lawyer, will be sworn
in today as the prime minister of Jamaica, succeeding Mr Michael Manley, who
retired on Saturday because of ill health.
Mr Manley's retirement took effect soon after the ruling People's National
party elected Mr Patterson as its president, giving him a margin of four
votes to every one in support of the only other contender, Miss Portia
Simpson, the labour and welfare minister. Miss Simpson had support in the
rural and inner-city areas, with Mr Patterson being backed by the
parliamentary party and the island's business community.
After his victory became clear, Miss Simpson claimed there had been
irregularities in the voting, but said she would respect the result 'in the
interest of the party and the country'. In accepting his election to the
presidency of the PNP, Mr Patterson invited supporters of both factions to
unite under his leadership.
The impact of the row on the unity of the government will be reflected in
the composition of the cabinet Mr Patterson names this week. Mr Hugh Small,
finance minister, who supported Miss Simpson's candidature, said he doubted
he would be appointed to Mr Patterson's new cabinet.
The new prime minister has held several portfolios over the past 20 years,
but left the cabinet under a cloud in January following allegations that, as
finance minister, he had erred in granting a waiver of import duties to the
local subsidiary of an oil company, headed by a member of the PNP executive.
He had come under intense pressure from factions in the ruling party and
opposition, and from the public, to resign, and was omitted from the cabinet
in a reshuffle by Mr Manley on New Year's Day.
His first big task will be to bring some stability to the economy.
