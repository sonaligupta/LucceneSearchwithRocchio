FT  27 OCT 92 / BNFL fights cancer test case


BRITISH Nuclear Fuels was accused in a civil lawsuit yesterday of causing or
contributing to the cancer that affected two children whose fathers worked
at the Sellafield reprocessing plant in Cumbria.
The High Court test case, on which up to 40 other claims may depend,
includes allegations that nuclear radiation damaged the fathers' sperm or
the mothers' eggs and resulted in genetic injury.
BNFL is contesting the hearing, expected to last between six months and a
year.
In the first case, Mrs Elizabeth Reay of Hensingham, Cumbria, is claiming
damages over the death of her daughter Dorothy, aged 10 months, of leukaemia
in 1962. Subject to a final ruling on liability, her damages have been
agreed at Pounds 150,000. That includes compensation for loss of her
daughter and for anguish suffered by her and her husband George - a
Sellafield worker - who died of cancer in the 1980s.
The second claimant is Miss Vivien Hope, 27, who was successfully treated
for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma - re-lated to leukaemia - but was left parlty
disabled and infertile. Her father David also worked at the plant. Her
damages for personal injury have been agreed at Pounds 125,000.
The writs allege, among other things, that BNFL was in breach of its
statutory duty under the Nuclear Installations Act not to cause harm to
persons or property by radioactive emissions.
Mr Benet Hytner, counsel for Mrs Reay, said it was not necessary to prove
negligence against BNFL.
'The plaintiffs will succeed if they can prove, on the balance of
probabilities, that radiation from Sellafield was a material contributory
cause of the diseases contracted by Dorothy and Vivien,' said Mr Hytner.
BNFL denies any link between the levels of radioactivity at Sellafield -
formerly Windscale - and the incidences of childhood leukaemia.
