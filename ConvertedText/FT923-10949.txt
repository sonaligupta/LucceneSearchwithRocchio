FT  28 JUL 92 / Letter: Jubilee Line will meet interests of Londoners and
taxpayers


   From PETER W CORFIELD


Sir, Your leader, 'Transport in Docklands' (July 22), correctly identified
the various components of this complex matter and needlessly lengthy debate.
However, in suggesting that the government should conduct a cost benefit
analysis you are clearly unaware that such an assessment was conducted, in
considerable depth, and forms the basis for the Jubilee Line Extension
Project. Of significance, one of the major benefits was seen to be the
transfer of excess passenger traffic from the Central, District and Circle
Lines to the Jubilee Line to the advantage of east-west-east commuters.
The vexed question of a contribution to costs from the private sector is
surely beyond debate - to my knowledge there is no formal, legally binding
agreement between the two parties, although Olympia & York clearly had every
intention of honouring its side of the bargain prior to its recent
misfortunes. This contrasts strongly with the arrangements for improving the
Docklands Light Railway - to which Olympia & York contributed in cash and
kind more than Pounds 100m and got, in return, a system that until recently
was quite unreliable and which was completed two years later than agreed.
By investing in the Jubilee Line extension, the government will meet the
interests of people who live and work in London and will protect the
interests of taxpayers at large. A considerable loss of income to central
funds from the unified business rates in the Docklands area, ranging from
Pounds 72m to Pounds 190m per year, is the inevitable consequence of
cancellation.
By providing the Jubilee Line the government will also be recognising the
plight of the east and south-east London communities which, although
contributing magnificently to the wealth and status of London for centuries,
have been denied proper access to the work and entertainment centres of the
capital. Peter W Corfield,
