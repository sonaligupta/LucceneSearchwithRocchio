FT  27 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Metalrax advances to Pounds 4.11m


   By ANDREW BOLGER


Metalrax Group, the precision components, houseware and storage equipment
group, increased pre-tax profits by 15 per cent from Pounds 3.56m to Pounds
4.11m in the six months to June 30, on sales which rose by 17 per cent to
Pounds 38.88m.
Mr John Wardle, chairman, said only a very small proportion of the profits
rise was due to acquisitions, of which the full benefit would be seen next
year and thereafter.
Mr Wardle said: 'Despite conflicting evidence as to the strength of the
apparent recovery and the dubious optimism very naturally shown by official
pronouncements, life continues to be very difficult at the sharp end of
manufacturing industry.
'It is only because of the very heavy investment in technology over the last
five years that we have managed to mitigate the intense pressures on margins
that have increased rather than relaxed.'
Earnings per share grew by 15 per cent to 3p (2.6p). The interim dividend
rose by 10 per cent to 1p (adjusted 0.91p).
