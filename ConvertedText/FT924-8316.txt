FT  11 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Attack renewed on Lasmo


   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON


BEAR raiders, out in force against Lasmo on Monday, reappeared yesterday
afternoon as Wall Street opened, and drove the share price down again amid a
flurry of bearish rumours and exceptionally heavy turnover.
The shares rose strongly in early trading, moving up from an overnight 164p
to 168p, and were trading comfortably around 165p when Wall Street opened.
They then came under significant pressure, with US investors said to be big
sellers amid a welter of wild rumours, including hints of an imminent shift
in dividend policy, an impending profits warning and big losses on currency
trading. At worst, Lasmo touched 154p before steadying and closing a net 9
down at 155p. Turnover reached a heavy 10m shares.
Sources close to Lasmo were sceptical about the rumours. Some believed the
selling reflected hints that Lasmo may be considering a stock offer in New
York and that some US investors were selling shares with the intention of
buying them back after the offering.
Rolls-Royce hit
Fears for the next year's dividend in the wake of the financial difficulties
at GPA sent Rolls-Royce falling sharply for the second day in a row.
At the day's worst the shares were down 12 1/2 at 112p, and backwardation -
a situation in which the offer and bid prices are temporarily reversed - was
seen late in the session.
Analysts fear that the problems at GPA, which has orders for 45 Boeing 757s
due to be powered by Rolls-Royce engines, may have a severe effect on the
1993 profits of the aero-engine maker, raising worries about the dividend.
Researchers also pointed to problems at the company's NEI subsidiary.
The strong market trend helped the stock to rally a little to end a net 9
1/2 off at 115p after heavy turnover of 7.4m shares.
UB placing
Shares in United Biscuit fell back after the food group said it was making
an Pounds 80m share placing to help fund the Pounds 198m purchase of an
Australian snacks company from Coca-Cola.
Dealers said the 24.1m shares were placed at 332p - 14 below UB's opening
price yesterday - by County NatWest and SG Warburg. However, as the market
closed, rumours continued to suggest that some of the stock had proved
difficult to shift.
Although some analysts expressed caution over the level of UB's debt - which
could reach 70 per cent by next year - they were generally supportive over
the move. Nomura raised its profits forecast from Pounds 196.5m to Pounds
204.25m for 1993, with earnings per share of 26.8p. UB's shares closed 9
cheaper at 337p.
The market was shaken by the extent of the profits decline revealed at SG
Warburg, the merchant bank widely viewed as the UK's most successful
integrated investment house since the Big Bang reforms of the 1980s. Warburg
shares plunged 45 to 479p with a hefty 2.5m shares changing hands.
Analysts moved quickly to downgrade forecasts after the post-results
meeting. Full-year estimates were chopped by around Pounds 50m, to the
Pounds 125m to Pounds 130m level, and for next year by around Pounds 20m.
Hambros, reporting interims this morning and expected to show profits only
marginally lower than last time's Pounds 37.6m, eased 4 to 244p.
The market gave a good reception to General Accident's third-quarter
numbers, which were accompanied by a relatively confident statement on the
current outlook. General Accident shares ran up 14 to 550p.
The oil majors were in the forefront of the market's advance, responding to
the further strength in the dollar, a rally in the oil price and suggestions
that Opec may take steps to reign in production when it holds its next
meeting at the end of the month. BP raced up 8 1/2 to 236 1/2 p on turnover
of 6.6m. Shell advanced 9 to 539p on 4.2m traded in front of tomorrow's
third-quarter figures. There was also aggressive switching from Royal Dutch
into Shell.
Calor dipped 5 more to 229p after the company confirmed that SHV, the Dutch
investment company, had been behind the recent buying and had lifted its
stake to 47.26 per cent, or 79.5m shares.
A stronger dollar helped some US earners. Reuters Holdings rose 15 to 1253p,
with Goldman Sachs said to be recommending the stock. Glaxo gained 11 to
821p even though it was announced that the US holding has dropped to 23.8
per cent, down around a percentage point over the past two months.
SmithKline Beecham 'A' put on 4 1/2 at 517p, but Wellcome weakened as US
sellers forced the stock down 8 to 987p.
ICI retreated from a day's high of 1058p to close 9 up on balance at 1048p
after US investment house Paine Webber downgraded its rating on the company
to neutral from attractive. Analyst Mr Andrew Cash said that while the
weaker pound might help dollar earnings it was 'clobbering the ADR price'.
He added that he was worried about Europe and has cut his 1992 earnings per
ADR forecast for the company to Dollars 3.10 from Dollars 3.40.
Industrial gases group BOC fell 11 to 703p, with Lehman Brothers selling the
stock ahead of results.
In a buoyant food retail sector, ASDA was the biggest volume stock of the
day as nearly 50m were traded, the price edging forward 2 1/2 to 47 1/2 p.
An agency cross of 6.1m was recorded, the shares apparently bought at 46 1/2
p and placed at 47p.
Dealers said the impetus for the continued heavy turnover - yesterday's was
the largest in nearly a year - came from institutions which had taken up
shares in the rights issue last year at 35p and were now taking profits.
However, ASDA's rehabilitation as a recovery stock meant that new buyers
were available to produce two-way business.
Heavy turnover was also seen in Tesco, with 15m shares traded. Staff share
options, thought to be up to 17m, could be exercised by Christmas. The stock
rose 3 to 226 1/2 p.
Dixons moved ahead, encouraged by a profits upgrade from Smith New Court.
The shares rose 11 to 236p.
Regional brewers were weak in early trading on an unconvincing rumour that
tomorrow's Autumn Statement would contain some form of excise duty increase.
Shares in British Aerospace continued to be hurt by the sentiment from GPA
and closed a penny lower at 134p after trade of 2.1m. Market watchers,
however, said further falls were restrained by reports that Germany is
reconsidering its withdrawal from the European Fighter Aircraft (EFA). BAe
is the UK's lead contractor on the project.
Confirmation from the chairman that car components manufacturer T & N would
not be making a rights issue to fund its DM250m acquisition of German
company Goetze, announced yesterday, boosted the shares. Dealers saw the
deal as an indication that fears over the dividend may have been overdone.
The shares closed 7 up at 143p.
Pearson eased 5 to 348p on poorer than expected figures on sales of BSkyB
satellite dishes. Granada suffered for the same reason, falling 8 to 275p.
A strong buy recommendation issued by Henderson Crosthwaite was behind the 3
rise in GEC to 259p. Mr Brian Newman, electronics specialist at Henderson,
said the 10 per cent-plus sterling devaluation has improved GEC's
competitive position more than investors realise. Henderson lifted its
1993/94 profits estimate by Pounds 30m to Pounds 950m.
