FT  12 MAR 92 / Halle trumpets Pounds 27m cash boost


   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent


THE GOVERNMENT is to put nearly Pounds 27m towards a new Pounds 46m concert
hall for Manchester's Halle orchestra, nearly doubling its previous
commitment. The decision comes two weeks after Manchester was given Pounds
55m towards its bid for the Olympics in the year 2000.
The announcement was greeted yesterday by four French horns, three trumpets,
three trombones and a tuba from the Halle's brass section, 'conducted' by Mr
Michael Heseltine, environment secretary.
Plans for the music itself to be the Fanfare for the Common Man were changed
when Mr Heseltine and Mr Graham Stringer, Labour leader of Manchester City
Council, realised this was the theme tune of the Social Democratic Party
during the 1980s.
La Peri, by Dukas ' composer of The Sorcerer's Apprentice ' was substituted,
but the complexities of keeping time soon defeated Mr Heseltine, who retired
to his seat after a dozen bars.
The new concert hall will replace Manchester's Free Trade Hall, home of the
Halle for most of the century. However great the hall's fame as a symbol of
the city's past glories, it suffers from poor acoustics and design.
The new hall will be a flagship for city-centre regeneration, opening up a
derelict tract of land now used as a car park. This has provided the
rationale for government backing. Central Manchester Development
Corporation, an agency of Mr Heseltine's department, had already asked for
clearance to put in Pounds 15m. Mr Heseltine confirmed that and approved a
further Pounds 7m yesterday.
A further Pounds 5m will come from the government's urban programme and
about Pounds 9m is likely from the European Community, with Manchester City
Council and the private sector providing the rest.
