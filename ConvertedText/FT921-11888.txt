FT  29 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Genesis Chile moves to counter discount


Genesis Chile Fund is making a scrip and warrant issue in an attempt to
improve the discount of its share price to net asset value - 22 per cent as
at January 15.
Directors believe the issues will increase the total value of shareholders'
investments in the fund relative to the underlying net asset value.
Holders of participating shares will receive a 1-for-4 scrip and warrants on
a 1-for-5 basis, carrying a subscription price of Dollars 16. If the
warrants are exercised in full the fund would receive net proceeds of
Dollars 26.2m (Pounds 14.4m).
Directors are also proposing to amend the fund's articles to remove the
present restrictions on investment in certain types of open and closed ended
investment vehicles in Chile.
