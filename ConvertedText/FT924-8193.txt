FT  12 NOV 92 / Observer: Biting back


Sad to hear that Culicoides impunctatus, the super-midge whose bites are the
abiding memory of many a tourist to the Scottish Highlands, has won a
reprieve.
The government has squashed tourist industry proposals to support the
introduction of two of the midge's deadly enemies - the oddly-named
Natterer's bat and a red mite - into the Highlands. The plan was that these
exotic predators would devour the midges.
However, Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, the Scottish Office minister, has told
the House of Lords that the Natterer's bat 'would probably have to consume a
considerable number of midges before it had a substantial high tea'. More
worrying was what the bat would eat when the offending midges were not in
season.
