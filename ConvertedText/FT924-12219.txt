FT  22 OCT 92 / Machinery directive set to be dropped


   By ANDREW BAXTER


A CONTROVERSIAL EC proposal which the UK believes would probably kill trade
in used machinery looks likely to be quietly dropped after strong opposition
by a majority of EC countries.
The Directive on Used Machinery - now in its third draft - is intended to
apply much the same safety requirements to second-hand machinery as new
equipment will face under the 1989 Machinery Directive. This is designed to
secure free trade throughout the EC for machinery that meets the safety
rules.
If passed, the used machinery directive would require second-hand equipment
to be certified as continuing to comply with the safety rules each time it
was resold. But this has been criticised as completely impracticable and
unduly bureaucratic.
Mr Edward Leigh, UK trade and technology minister, told a London conference
organised by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers that second-hand
machinery was likely to pose hazards as great as, and perhaps greater than,
new machinery.
Even so, the UK government believed that the proposed legislation on new
machinery, on use of machinery at work and the existing general product
safety directive provided adequate safeguards, and that there was no need
for additional legislation.
'Furthermore the proposed directive would require checking and certification
affecting a vast number of often small transactions, and would in practice
probably kill the extensive trade in used machinery on which much of
industry depends.
'We have therefore opposed it all along and the latest indications are that
it will be dropped altogether.'
At a meeting in Brussels in June, seven member states objected to the draft
in principle, and only Spain and Italy supported it. The European Commission
is considering its position and an announcement is expected soon.
