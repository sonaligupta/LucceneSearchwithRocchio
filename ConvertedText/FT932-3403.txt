FT  15 JUN 93 / BIS warns of rise in UK's net debt

BRITAIN'S overall debt position is deteriorating faster than any other
country in the Group of Seven leading industrial nations, according to the
Bank for International Settlements.
The government's net debt will jump to 41 per cent of the nation's output
this year from 35.5 per cent unless action is taken to raise taxes or cut
spending, the bank's annual report made clear yesterday.
The bank warned that out of 18 industrial countries, only two - Sweden and
Finland - face bigger problems than Britain in curbing the increase of
public indebtedness.
BIS calculations suggest that if the government were to try to stabilise its
ratio of net debt to gross domestic product at the 1992 level, it would have
to raise taxes or cut spending by about 5.5 per cent of GDP or Pounds 33bn
this year. Net debt measures overall government debt minus the value of
public sector assets.
The Pounds 33bn compares with the government's March Budget package of
Pounds 17bn worth of tax increases spread over the three financial years
ending 1995-96 and the forecast British public sector borrowing requirement
of Pounds 50bn in 1993-94.
The BIS figures highlight the damage done to the government's finances by
the recession.
Of the 18 countries, only Ireland and Japan appeared able to avoid an
increase in their debt/GDP ratios this year, the BIS said. Without
specifically mentioning Britain, the report added: 'Debt stabilisation in
most countries would require a substantial tightening of fiscal policy, in
some cases beyond what is realistically possible.'
The bank blamed the suddenness of the UK's slide into debt on 'a relatively
deep recession and a number of expansionary measures (in public spending)'.
