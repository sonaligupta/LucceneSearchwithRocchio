FT  13 NOV 93 / International Company News: Price rise boosts Philip Morris

SHARES in Philip Morris rose sharply yesterday after the US tobacco, beer
and food group said it would raise wholesale cigarette prices by 4 cents a
pack, matching an increase announced by RJR Reynolds earlier this week.
In anticipation of the Philip Morris announcement, three Wall Street
securities houses - Goldman Sachs, Salomon Brothers and Bear Stearns -
upgraded their ratings on the stock and increased their earnings estimates
for the company, which markets Marlboro, the world's best-selling cigarette
brand.
Afterwards Philip Morris's share price, which had climbed a day earlier on
expectations that the company would follow RJR's lead, rose steadily on Wall
Street to close Dollars 2 1/4 higher on the day at Dollars 59.
The move signals the cessation of a cigarette price war which began in April
when Philip Morris announced that it was cutting the prices of its premium
brands by 40 cents a pack as part of a plan to stem the surging popularity
of discount cigarettes.
The strategy appears to have succeeded in shoring up the Marlboro's market
share, which currently stands at about 25 per cent, against a low of 21.5
per cent before the price cut.
However, the pricing decision, which was soon followed by other cigarette
manufacturers, has led to squeeze on earnings.
