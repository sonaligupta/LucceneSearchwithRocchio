FT  02 NOV 93 / Union abandons BT strike ballot


   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor


THE MAIN UNION at British Telecommunications has backed away from a fight
over this year's pay offer of 1.9 per cent after consulting local officials.
The National Communications Union, led by a leftwing executive since June,
had rejected the offer and decided to recommend strike action in a ballot of
its 140,000 members.
But local officials strongly advised that union members were far more
concerned about job security than pay.
Although the 1.9 per cent will now be accepted, it is not clear whether
union members will also receive the extra Pounds 20 BT had originally
offered as an inducement to union officials to recommend acceptance - it was
withdrawn after they refused.
The pay rise will take the pay of a top-grade technical officer from Pounds
17,770 to Pounds 18,108, and a lower-grade clerical worker from Pounds
10,700 to Pounds 10,903.
The union and BT both fear that some conflict may be unavoidable over the
company's aim to shed a further 15,000 employees next year after two years
of heavy, but voluntary, job-shedding. Unions have received a strong
endorsement from Sir Colin Marshall, chairman of British Airways.
In the GMB general union's magazine, Sir Colin says unions help motivation
and play a 'good role' at British Airways.
'British Airways is happy to work with the unions and there is no question
of derecognising them,' he says. 'Unions play an important role in the
company because they collectively represent the interests of the workforce.'
His comments were reinforced by Mrs Rhiannon Chapman, director of the
Industrial Society. Writing in the society's newsletter, published today,
she urges employers to resist the temptation to de-recognise unions and says
it is easy to underestimate the value of a good, experienced union
representative in 'oiling the wheels' and solving day-to-day problems.
