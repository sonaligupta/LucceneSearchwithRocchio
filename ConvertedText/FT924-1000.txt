FT  21 DEC 92 / Ruling party retains hold on Singapore

BOTH the government and the opposition in Singapore have claimed victory
after a by-election at the weekend which saw the ruling People's Action
Party retain its overwhelming hold on the island republic's politics.
The PAP won 73 per cent of the vote in the four-seat Marine Parade
constituency. Mr Goh Chok Tong, who took over from Mr Lee Kuan Yew as
Singapore's prime minister in late 1990, was a candidate. He said the vote
represented a 'resounding endorsement' for his government's policies and his
leadership.
The fledgling Singapore Democratic Party (SDP), which had put itself forward
as the main opposition party during the campaign, won 24 per cent of the
vote. The SDP said the result marked the beginning of a two-party political
system in Singapore.
The PAP has long had a monopoly on political power in Singapore and was
shocked when its vote in a general election midway through last year dropped
to 61 per cent, with four opposition members voted into the 81-seat
parliament.
Mr Goh, who has had difficulty escaping from the shadow of Mr Lee's long
years as Singapore's leader, had said that this by-election was a crucial
test of his leader ship.
In the general election last year the PAP won 77 per cent of the vote in
Marine Parade.
