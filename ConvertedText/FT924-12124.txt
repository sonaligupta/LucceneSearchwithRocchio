FT  22 OCT 92 / Thaw after a long winter: Emperor Akihito's historic visit
to China


   By ROBERT THOMSON


Conscious of the weight of history bearing down on him, Japan's Emperor
Akihito carefully delivers each of his pre-scripted public words,
punctuating the sentences with uncomfortably long silences and filtering the
emotion from a voice still ascribed supernatural qualities.
His tones will be more carefully measured than usual when he arrives in
China tomorrow for the first visit by a Japanese emperor. The humble Akihito
has made clear a sense of deep privilege that his reign should be chosen for
this journey.
The emperor's most obvious task will be to deal with the relatively recent
past, the invasion of China during the 1930s and 1940s, by delivering an
unambiguous apology and, perhaps, clearing the way for an era in which the
economic potential of the relationship will finally overcome the bitter
memories.
For the Communist party leaders who invited the emperor, the six-day visit
has a less lofty, more immediate purpose. They are still in the process of
convincing the Chinese people that the regime has the respect of the
international community, and any foreign dignitary has been much appreciated
since the Tiananmen crackdown of 1989. In these circumstances, a visit by
the emperor is all the more welcome.
The Chinese government is also keen to attract Japanese investment, a
controversial issue during the early 1980s when the revolutionary elders
drew comparisons between Japanese joint ventures in northern China and the
occupation of Manchuria in the 1930s, an occupation begun in the name of the
then Emperor Hirohito, father of Akihito.
It is a sign of the changed times that six leading trading houses, including
Mitsubishi Corp and Mitsui & Co yesterday announced a plan to build a
Dollars 4bn petrochemical complex in the northern Chinese province of
Liaoning. Japanese trading houses are also developing an industrial park in
the northern city of Dalian, and a Japanese trucking company has announced
plans for a transportation network in the north.
In the year of the Akihito visit, the 20th anniversary of the restoration of
Sino-Japanese relations, China will become Japan's second-largest trading
partner, behind the US, and up from fifth place a year ago. Japanese
investment in China, which rose from Dollars 349m in 1990 to Dollars 579m
last year, is likely to double this year, as manufacturers bruised by
falling profits source more of their components in low-cost and increasingly
reliable China.
The emperor is certain to laud this developing bilateral economic
relationship. But the flow of funds and an apology from the emperor are not
likely to appease a Chinese people raised on horrific tales of the 'burn
all, loot all, kill all' policies of the Japanese military during the second
world war.
Detailing the brutality of that period has served the Communist party's
interests as it highlights the 'heroic' role of revolutionary-era soldiers,
one of whom, Deng Xiaoping, is now an emperor himself in everything but
name. In deference to the Japanese emperor, Beijing has barred protests by
private groups seeking war compensation from Japan and taken much newspaper
space to explain the new, non-political role of Akihito.
Japan's foreign ministry is also emphasising the 'non-political' role of the
emperor, as enshrined in the constitution, and arguing that the event is
nothing more than a 'goodwill visit'. This interpretation is questioned by
some sceptical members of the ruling Liberal Democratic party.
Evidence of the relationship's rich and complex history is shown in the
varied opposition from left, right and middle-ground groups in Tokyo. There
are complaints that the timing of the visit violates the emperor's
'non-political' status and about the flattering of a discredited Chinese
leadership.
Then there is concern that the exalted Japanese emperor is travelling to
'pay tribute'. Even at the height of Chinese influence over the past two
millennia, during which Japan imported a written language and the essence of
its spiritual and philosophic beliefs, no emperor crossed the sea to
Beijing.
