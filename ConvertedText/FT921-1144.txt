FT  25 MAR 92 / Observer: A friend in need


Poor old David Dinkins. It is a sure sign that the hapless mayor of New York
is in deep trouble when he has to ask a Rockefeller for help.
The black mayor, who seems to stumble from one calamity to another, needed a
new deputy, so he called in David Rockefeller, one of the banking world's
most prominent power brokers. Rockefeller, whose stable of proteges is
rarely bare, didn't take long to find the right man - Barry Sullivan, who
stepped down from the chairmanship of First Chicago in December.
Sullivan used to work for Rockefeller's Chase Manhattan before moving up to
Chicago. Although he may be a reassuring name to New York City's nervous
bankers, his record at First Chicago seems, in retrospect, as mixed as
Rockefeller's own career at Chase.
