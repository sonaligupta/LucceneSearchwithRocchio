FT  12 MAR 92 / International Company News: Bayer to hold payout after 4.8%
decline

   FRANKFURT


BAYER, the last of the big three German chemicals companies to report 1991
results, yesterday announced better figures than either BASF or Hoechst, and
 -unlike the other two companies - said it would hold its dividend at the
same level as 1990.
Bayer said pre-tax profits fell by 4.8 per cent to DM3.2bn (Dollars 2bn)
last year, on sales up 1.8 per cent to DM42.4bn, and it intended to hold its
dividend at DM13 per share. On Tuesday Hoechst and BASF reported 1991
profits down by over 20 per cent and said they would cut their dividends by
DM1 to DM12 per share.
Yesterday's figures pleased analysts who were predicting comparatively good
figures for Bayer but were worried peer pressure would force the company to
cut its dividend in line with the other two.
In the event, it was the first time since 1983 the three companies' dividend
policies have in any way diverged.
Bayer gave no detailed commentary on its results, but analysts said the
better figures reflected the company's higher exposure to the non-cyclical
pharmaceutical sector. Over half the group's sales come from
pharmaceuticals, thus insulating group earnings from the full impact of the
prolonged downturn in worldwide chemicals industry.
Analysts said up to 70 per cent of current year profits could come from this
area, in particular from four products, the Adalat hypertension drug, the
Cipro antibiotic, Alka-Seltzer and Bayer Aspirin.
But group profits could be held back by dire conditions in the chemical
sector, especially the polyurethane and titanium dioxide markets. Here world
prices are weak as a result of intense competition at a time when costs are
high.
Bayer said group cash-flow rose 2.2 per cent to DM5.5bn and during the
course of last year it invested DM3.1bn on fixed assets and a further DM3bn
on research and development, compared with DM3.7bn and DM2.7bn respectively
in 1990.
