FT  05 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Cookson


Cookson's management has done a fine job pulling the company back from the
brink. The business has been slimmed down from the sprawling conglomerate of
the 1980s and the balance sheet repaired, albeit courtesy of two rights
issues. Gearing is below 30 per cent and Cookson is generating net cash
before disposals, so the financial position looks secure. Full-year growth
in operating profits of 18 per cent, excluding the favourable impact of
currencies, also testifies to success in eliminating losses while keeping
the lid on costs.
But with the trading margin already up to 8.4 per cent by the year-end,
Cookson will find that rate of progress difficult to sustain. The final
stages of loss elimination should push the margin up towards 9 per cent, not
far short of the company's stated double-digit target. The focus thereafter
will have to shift towards expanding sales. An underlying 5 per cent
turnover increase last year was more than respectable given difficult market
conditions. More will be required to maintain forward momentum.
With around half its turnover in the US, Cookson should be an early
beneficiary of recovery. Other acts of good housekeeping - such as
increasing the proportion of UK profits to avoid writing off additional
advance corporate tax - would also help earnings. With the shares at a 20
per cent price-earnings premium to the market average, though, Cookson will
have to live up to a growth-stock billing.
