FT  03 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pakistan and India join forces
to combat looming locust threat

A TEAM of senior Pakistani agricultural officials, accompanied by UN
specialists, visited the city of Rahim Yar Khan in Southern Punjab this
week, amid growing concerns over a potential locust attack.
The large cotton crop is considered to be faced with the greatest risk,
followed by sugar-cane, senior officials say.
The sense of urgency has pushed both India and Pakistan - South Asia's two
main rivals - to co-operate in launching a large-scale locust emergency
operation on both sides of their borders in Punjab and along the Pakistani
province of Sindh.
Plant protection officials from the two sides are reported to have
maintained daily radio contact during the past week.
Mr Zahid Saeed, Pakistan's acting foreign secretary said earlier this week
in response to questions on Indo-Pakistani co-operation: 'This is a common
problem, we'll have to face it together close to border areas.
'Locusts don't need passports or visas to travel.'
'They can ruin crops on either side of the border,' added a senior Western
diplomat in Islamabad.
Some senior officials say that military commanders from both countries have
also been in touch, to avoid fire on spraying aircrafts and helicopters.
'We have to avoid any accidents because as you know, there are troops on
both sides,' one official said.
Some officials say that they are pressed for time and money. The next week
is considered to be the crucial period for stepping up spraying operations,
before the locusts start flying to areas with large crop lands.
The spraying operations on the Pakistani side are estimated to cost Dollars
1.3m. So far, only Dollars 300,000 dollars has been committed in aid by
bilateral donors and the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation.
