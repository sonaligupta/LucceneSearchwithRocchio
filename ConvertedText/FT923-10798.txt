FT  29 JUL 92 / Athens transport strike extended


   By AGENCIES


Public transport workers in Athens yesterday extended their strike for at
least a week and other unions decided to join them in solidarity, agencies
report.
About 5,000 workers at the state bus company marched through central Athens
to the Labour Ministry to protest against 1,200 job losses.
The transport ministry used hundreds of army trucks to help the city's
commuters but taxis were almost impossible to find and traffic chaotic.
In Brussels, the European Commission dropped its inquiry into allegations
that foreign companies were being frozen out of Greek public works contracts
after the authorities promised to drop discriminatory practices.
