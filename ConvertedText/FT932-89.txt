FT  30 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Heavitree ahead of budget with Pounds 0.4m


Heavitree Brewery, the USM-traded pub operator, produced profits of Pounds
401,000 pre-tax for the six months to April 30, against Pounds 232,000 last
time, restated for FRS 3.
Mr William Tucker, chairman of the Devon-based group, said the outcome -
struck after interest charges reduced from Pounds 309,000 to Pounds 197,000
 -was some 2.5 per cent ahead of budget. 'There is good reason to anticipate
that the full year will see a return to our previous levels of profit,' he
added.
Turnover showed little change at Pounds 3.85m (Pounds 3.83m).
The Heavitree Inns subsidiary incurred an operating deficit of Pounds 80,000
but was on course for a profitable year, Mr Tucker said.
The interim dividend is maintained at 0.6p, payable from earnings of 3.2p
(1.8p) per share.
