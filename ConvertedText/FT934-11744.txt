FT  29 OCT 93 / International Company News: Noranda pushed into red by
weaker metal prices


   By BERNARD SIMON

WEAK metal and forest-products prices pushed Noranda, the Canadian resources
group to a third-quarter loss.
The net loss was CDollars 8m (Dollars 6.1m), or eight cents a share,
compared with earnings of CDollars 26m, or six cents, a year earlier.
Revenues dipped to CDollars 1.29bn from CDollars 1.40bn.
The worst setback was in the mining and metals division, where last year's
earnings of CDollars 48m turned into a CDollars 10m loss.
The forest products division posted earnings of CDollars 10m, compared to
breaking even last year. A strong performance in the building materials
market was partly offset by a further fall in pulp prices. Noranda said it
expected no improvement in the pulp, newsprint or commodity papers market
until well into 1994.
Oil and gas earnings were virtually unchanged, with the stronger natural gas
market making up for a slide in oil prices and volumes.
Noranda, controlled by the Toronto branch of the Bronfman family, earlier
this year sold its 49 per cent stake in MacMillan Bloedel, the west coast
forestry company.
