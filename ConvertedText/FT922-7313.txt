FT  19 MAY 92 / SIB announces four committees


THE Securities and Investments Board yesterday announced the appointment of
four sub-committees to examine how its planned self-regulatory organisation
to oversee all retail investment business would work in practice.
A committee has been working since early this year on the proposal. The new
organisation will be put together from two existing regulatory bodies:
Lautro, the life insurance and unit trust overseer, and Fimbra, which looks
after independent intermediaries.
