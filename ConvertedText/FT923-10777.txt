FT  29 JUL 92 / Schools to pay proper regard to Christian heritage and
traditions


SCHOOLS must pay proper regard to the nation's Christian heritage and
traditions, the white paper says.
The white paper, which includes a chapter on spiritual and moral
development, says 'education cannot and must not be value-free'.
The government's 1988 Education Reform Act required the curriculum to
promote the spiritual, moral and cultural development of pupils as well as
their mental and physical development. About a third of local authorities
have since reviewed the teaching of religious education. That review, the
white paper says, was a 'major impetus for curriculum development in
religious education' and the government is to require all local authorities
to review religious education.
Grant-maintained schools will be allowed to use any agreed religious
education syllabus, rather than the one adopted by the local authority.
