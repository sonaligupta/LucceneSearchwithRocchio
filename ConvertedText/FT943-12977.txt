FT  22 JUL 94 / Italian steel chief 'paid bribes'


   By ROBERT GRAHAM


   ROME


Mr Alberto Falck, owner of the biggest family steel concern in Italy, is
reported to have admitted paying L500m (Pounds 206,600) in bribes to members
of the Guardia di Finanza, the financial police, to soften their controls of
his group's balance sheet. The steel magnate is co-operating with
magistrates following the issuing of an arrest warrant last week by Milan
magistrates investigating alleged corruption in the Guardia di Finanza in
Lombardy, according to Ansa, the national news agency. Mr Falck was one of
49 people issued with a warrant on charges of alleged corruption at the
moment when the Italian government had approved the controversial decree,
since revoked, limiting the use of preventive detention. He was placed under
house arrest. His confession emerged as Milan magistrates resumed work this
week in the wake of the Berlusconi's government's climb-down on the decree.
