FT  15 NOV 93 / Axing of safety rules suggested


   By ROLAND RUDD


THE REPEAL of many regulations governing safety in industry has been
recommended by a Department of Trade and Industry working party.
The DTI is considering ways of eliminating bureaucracy and red tape. The
measures will be contained in a deregulation bill, to be announced in the
Queen's Speech on Thursday.
The working party is recommending a number of changes to the health and
safety acts and a reassessment of European safety regulations only just
coming into force.
Its recommendations include restricting which business operations need to
abide by health and safety regulations. Temporary workers would also have to
buy their own hard hats and other protective clothing.
Mr Neil Hamilton, minister for corporate affairs, is to hold a series of
meeting with his opposite numbers at the various departments affected by the
government's deregulation drive.
The final details of the deregulation bill are not expected to be thrashed
out until later next month.
