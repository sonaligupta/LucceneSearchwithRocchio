FT  05 JUN 92 / UK Company News: 600 Group holds dividend as losses are
reduced to Pounds 534,000


   By ANGUS FOSTER


SHARES IN 600 Group yesterday jumped 9p to 53p as the machine tool and
mechanical handling company proposed holding its dividend and said it was
broadly optimistic about the outlook.
The company reported an 18 per cent reduction in pre-tax losses, from Pounds
650,000 to Pounds 534,000, in the year to end-March.
Mr Colin Gaskell, group managing director, said margins were maintained and
costs cut during the period. 'We expect to achieve an improved outcome even
at current depressed levels of trading,' he said.
But he warned that business conditions remained difficult to predict and
were likely to stay depressed for 'six to nine months'.
Turnover fell 30 per cent from Pounds 140.8m to Pounds 98.5m. The company
said UK orders for machine tools were 50 per cent below normal levels, and
export markets were also difficult.
The fall in orders led to an operating loss of Pounds 1.74m (profit Pounds
4.1m). Interest costs improved to Pounds 2.1m (Pounds 3.3m) reflecting
falling interest rates and cost cutting.
The company was helped by exceptional profits of Pounds 3.3m, against costs
last time of Pounds 1.5m. This represented the balance between exceptional
surpluses of Pounds 9.4m from property sales and reorganisation costs of
Pounds 6.05m stemming from combining two lathe companies to one site.
Losses per share were 3.2p (3.3p). A proposed final dividend of 1.5p (1p)
makes an unchanged total of 2.5p. Transfers from reserves totalled Pounds
3.08m (Pounds 4.58m).
Cost savings of Pounds 13m were made during the year, compared to a
predicted saving of Pounds 6m. Stocks fell by Pounds 6m while debtors fell
in line with sales, the company said. This, combined with proceeds from
property disposals, helped bring gearing down from 36 per cent to 12 per
cent at the year end.
The full year figures also suggested a slight improvement from the interim
stage, when the company suffered a loss before tax of Pounds 2.32m on sales
of Pounds 50.6m, compared to profits of Pounds 1.66m on turnover of Pounds
72m.
