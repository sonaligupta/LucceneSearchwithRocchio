FT  21 JUL 94 / Shake-up at German publisher


   By JUDY DEMPSEY


   BERLIN


Axel Springer, Germany's largest newspaper group, has sacked four of the
seven board members, including Mr Horst Keiser, the chairman designate, in
one of the country's biggest ever management shake-ups.
The announcement, made to stunned shareholders at the annual meeting in
Berlin, follows months of criticism within the group and among the family
about Springer's strategy.
The Springer family holds 50 per cent of the group, which publishes Die
Welt, the loss-making daily, the mass-circulation Bild and the Berliner
Morgenpost. It also holds 20 per cent of the Sat-1 television station. The
Kirch Group, headed by Mr Leo Kirch, holds 35 per cent of Springer and 40
per cent of Sat-1.
Mr Bernhard Servatius, chairman of the supervisory board, said: 'Axel
Springer will attempt to meet the challenges of the markets with a
significantly changed board.' Springer last year had a turnover of DM3.4bn,
(Pounds 1.4bn), a fall of 1 per cent on the previous year, and profits of
DM71m, a rise of DM14.2m.
Mr Jurgen Richter, 52, was appointed chairman of the management board. He
will be flanked by three new members. Among those sacked are Mr Claus
Liesner, chief financial officer and Mr Hans-Joachim Marx, responsible for
technology.
The shake-up coincides with the rapid expansion of the electronic media,
involving new partnerships between Germany's biggest publishing groups and
foreign companies. These include the decision by Bertelsmann and News
Corporation, owned by Mr Rupert Murdoch, to take over Vox, the Cologne-based
television station which faced liquidation.
