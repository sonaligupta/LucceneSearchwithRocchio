FT  19 APR 91 / International Company News: Nedlloyd Fl 148m loss at high
end of forecasts

NEDLLOYD, the Dutch transport group, posted a net loss for 1990 of Fl 148.2m
(Dollars 78.4m), down sharply from a net profit of Fl 252.3m in 1989 and at
the high end of the company's previously forecast range of Fl 125m to Fl
150m.
The reversal in performance was due mainly to a severe downturn in
ocean-going shipping but also to a more modest decline in land transport.
These two sectors, which form the core of the Nedlloyd group, fell into the
red last year and are expected to be loss-making again this year, though
both areas should improve, Mr Henk Rootliep, the company's chairman, said.
Last year's losses would have been higher if it had not been for profits of
Fl 110m on the sale of fixed assets.
On the other hand, Nedlloyd also recorded an extraordinary charge of Fl 8m
in 1990 against extraordinary gains of Fl 54.2m in 1989.
Nedlloyd has come under pressure from a leading shareholder, Mr Torstein
Hagen, the Norwegian investor, to speed up the sale of non-core businesses.
Mr Rootliep repeated his view that management will not be rushed into
divestments. Shipping, which is in the middle of a restructuring, was hit by
declines in both the dollar and freight rates on significant east-west trade
routes. Operating profit swung into a loss of Fl 78m from a profit of Fl
111.3m.
