FT  16 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent rises across the
board on Dow's advance


   By Our Markets Staff


WALL Street's record high on Tuesday, and a varying weight of local
influences were advanced as reasons why bourses climbed yesterday, writes
Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT found strong domestic reasons for its gains which were
considerable, the DAX index accelerating to a 38.97, or 2.4 per cent rise to
1,667.50 after the FAZ put on 14.15, or 2.1 per cent to 672.67 at
midsession.
Mr Jens Wiecking, for Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, said that German equities
were a special situation, having underperformed the world for nearly two
years during which foreigners had been selling the market, on balance.
This year's recovery, he said, was built on the anticipation of the
Bundesbank easing its monetary policies and a subsequent bull market. It
started with the Anglo Saxons but continental investors followed yesterday,
boosting German market volume from DM6.4bn to DM12bn on one estimate.
Meanwhile, the focus on individual sectors shifted again. Banks, after a
period of relative strength, were quiet despite a further drop in the
Bundesbank's average bond yield from 8.18 to 8.15 per cent.
In conventional cyclicals the big blue chip carmakers, which had taken over
from the banking sector, were outshone by chemicals, where Hoechst put on
another DM13.30 to DM248.80; and among bombed out stocks the construction
group, Philipp Holzmann, closed DM63 higher at DM1,138.
PARIS rose to its highest level since last October as Wall Street's record
rise overnight prompted domestic institutions to go on a buying spree. The
CAC 40 closed 29.82 or 1.6 per cent higher at 1,873.62, off the day's high
of 1,884.6, in heavy turnover of FFr3.9bn after Tuesday's FFr2.5bn.
Gains were across the board. Peugeot jumped FFr26 to FFr700 after positive
comments from its chairman on the previous day. In the oil sector, Total
added FFr34 to FFr1,1088 on its optimism about its Colombian oil find, and
Elf gained FFr5.90 to FFr371.20.
Among smaller stocks, Canal Plus rose FFr22 to FFr1,050 in relatively good
volume of 117,575 shares.
ZURICH offered easing Swiss interest rates and the firm dollar in addition
to the Dow as justification for the Credit Suisse index advance of 1.5 per
cent or 6.9 to 470.7.
Nestle bearers, SFr210 higher at SFr9,140, topped the active list after
Tuesday's news that the company might be considering a ten-for-one stock
split. Banks were led higher by CS Holding which added SFr65 to SFr1,925; in
chemicals, Sandoz registered rose SFr60 to SFr2,640; and in insurers, lifted
by interest rate hopes, Winterthur bearers put on SFr160 to SFr3,840.
BRUSSELS was also lifted by Wall Street. The Bel20 index closed 34.35 or 3.1
per cent higher at 1,149.21 in unusually heavy turnover of BFr1.95bn.
Generale Bank was the most active stock, rising 2.6 per cent to FFr6,360
with 45,600 shares traded.
MILAN saw some domestic sellers at the start but then there was a scramble
to buy as other European bourses continued to rise. The Comit index rose
9.55 to 547.46 in turnover estimated at slightly better than Tuesday's
L125bn.
Stocks due to be transfered to screen-based trading today, the start of the
new trading account, were strong. Benetton rose L480 or 4.2 per cent to
L12,000, Sip added L48 to L1,538, Italgas put on L85 to L3,580, Italcementi
rose L395 to L21,600, and the transport company, Gottardo Ruffoni, climbed
L85 to L2,340.
Pirelli continued to rise ahead of its capital increase, putting on L43 or
3.9 per cent to L1,123. The stock reached L1,170 after hours.
MADRID's general index rose 5.19, or 2 per cent to 258.50, impressed by the
drop in consumer price inflation from 6.5 per cent to 5.5 per cent in the
year to December, 1991.
AMSTERDAM closed higher in active trading. The CBS Tendency Index rose 2.3
or 1.9 per cent to 120.3 in turnover swollen by Friday's expiration on the
European Options Exchange.
STOCKHOLM made gains in heavy trading, encouraged by overseas strength and
falling domestic interest rates. The Affarsvarlden General index rose 16.1
or 1.7 per cent to 974.7 in volume of SKr728m after SKr417m.
Astra continued to dominate trading, as turnover in its shares tripled to
SKr191m from SKr60m. Astra A rose SKr18 to SKr588.
OSLO jumped 2.1 per cent, the all-share index ending 9.33 higher at 452.46
in active turnover of about NKr460m. Industrial stocks led the rally. Norsk
Hydro, following a period of relative weakness, rose NKr6 to NKr145.
COPENHAGEN finished off its best as the CSE index closed 3.01 higher at
365.29. HELSINKI's Hex index put on another 15.92, or 1.8 per cent to 877.12
but free shares did better with a 2.5 per cent gain.
VIENNA surged in lively business to a six-week high on hopes that German
interest rates have peaked. The ATX index rose 24.58 or 2.6 per cent to
962.23, its highest close since December 4.
