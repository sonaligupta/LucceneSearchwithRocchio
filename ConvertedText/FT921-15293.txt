FT  10 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Inflation news elevates the
Dow


   By PATRICK HARVERSON


   NEW YORK


Wall Street
HELPED BY more good news on inflation which raised hopes for further
interest rate cuts, the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged higher to a new
closing record level yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow was up 5.59 at 3,209.53. The more broadly based
Standard & Poor's 500, however, slipped 0.49 to 417.61, but the Nasdaq
composite index of over-the-counter stocks continued its stellar
performance, jumping 9.48 to another all-time peak of 619.80.
Turnover on the New York SE was again very heavy, amounting to 292m shares.
News that producer prices fell 0.2 per cent in December provided an early
tonic for the market. Evidence that inflation is no longer a threat, at
least for the medium term, boosted hopes among investors that the Federal
Reserve would once more ease monetary policy.
Intense activity in the over-the-counter market showed no signs of abating,
with turnover heading for record levels as investors scrambled to buy
smaller, fast-growth companies in anticipation of a recovery in the US
economy by mid-year.
AMR, parent group of American Airlines, fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 71 3/8
after the company signalled its intention to sell up to 5m shares (4m in the
US and 1m overseas) to raise money for working capital.
Other big airline issues, which have been at the forefront of the market's
recent rally, also retreated. UAL slipped Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 150 1/2 ,
USAir Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 13 3/4 and Delta Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 69
1/2 .
Profit-taking also took its toll of JP Morgan, which receded Dollars 2 1/2
to Dollars 67 1/2 in spite of reporting strong fourth-quarter earnings of
Dollars 269m, up 41 per cent on the year. The stock reached an all-time high
of just over Dollars 70 this week, so some sort of downward reaction was
understandable.
Citicorp held firm at Dollars 10 1/2 after announcing the sale of a stake in
Saudi American Bank worth between Dollars 330m and Dollars 450m.
Time Warner climbed Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 94 3/8 as investors reacted
positively to news that the entertainment group's Warner Bros film
subsidiary had 13.9 per cent of the domestic box office in 1991, the largest
share of any movie studio.
Recent winners featured in the over-the-counter rally, with Microsoft
gaining Dollars 3 at Dollars 127 1/4 , Apple Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 62 1/4
and Intel Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 53 1/2 . A rare OTC loser was Adobe
Systems, which fell Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 63 on disappointing
fourth-quarter profits.
Canada
TORONTO stock prices soared in very heavy trading to register the biggest
single-session gain in more than four years, boosted by a rebound among gold
stocks and strong performances on overseas markets.
The composite index jumped 65 points or 1.85 per cent to close at 3,580.6,
its largest rise since December 14, 1987. Advances overwhelmed declines by
406 to 243 after a volume of 49m shares, against Wednesday's 36.4m. Turnover
was the sixth-highest single-day total in the exchange's history, and the
heaviest since the crash of October 1987.
