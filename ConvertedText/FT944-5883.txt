FT  01 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Endowed with the power to sell - Nicholas
Denton on Kleinwort Benson's latest privatisation coup


   By NICHOLAS DENTON


The selection of an adviser on a key Latin American power sell-off has
confirmed UK investment banks' domination of electricity privatisation.
It emerged this week that Codelco Chile, the state copper mining group, has
appointed Kleinwort Benson of the UK to handle the sale of a 570MW
coal-fired power plant, valued at Dollars 500m (Pounds 305m). One of the two
runners-up for the privatisation of the Tocopilla power station was also
London-based: NM Rothschild made it to the shortlist as well as CS First
Boston of the US.
About 80 per cent of international electricity privatisations have involved
either Kleinwort or Rothschild, one UK investment banker estimates. The
energy specialists of the two firms bump into each other in hotels all over
the world.
The impetus came from the UK's electricity privatisation on which Kleinwort
advised the government and Rothschild the Recs. 'It gave us leverage,' says
Mr Simon Robertson, deputy chairman of Kleinwort.
As work in the UK tailed off, Argentina's electricity sell-off, on which
Kleinwort advised the government, took off. It has privatisation mandates in
the UK, Portugal and Italy, as well as in Chile.
Rothschild's record is equally impressive. It lists no fewer than 23
international electricity transactions on which it has advised. In South
America alone, Rothschild has worked in Chile, Argentina, Peru and Brazil.
Even US competitors concede UK banks' strengths. 'Kleinwort does have a lot
of experience in these transactions,' says Mr Dan More, head of Morgan
Stanley's London-based energy group. About 30 Kleinwort staff worked on UK
electricity privatisation and the core of that energy team remains, headed
by Mr Richard Morse.
But critics say that the Kleinwort team, now 12 strong, is not particularly
deep. And to the extent that Kleinwort has a franchise in electricity
privatisation it is one that is dependent on individuals. They are
poachable: Morgan Stanley has hired Mr Glenn Suarez to beef up its team.
Rival investment banks point out, moreover, that the UK houses' dominance of
the electricity advisory rankings is a function of their work on the UK
privatisation, which remains by far the largest so far. Internationally, CS
First Boston, Morgan Stanley and Salomon Brothers have also established
reputations in the sector.
For all the carping, advice on electricity is widely acknowledged to be a
strength of UK houses. 'It's a thriving industry, the export of these kinds
of services,' says Mr Charles Alexander, Rothschild's head for Latin
America.
Rothschild has what investment bankers describe as 'a real niche' in
privatisation advisory work. And Kleinwort's work on Argentinian electricity
privatisation helped tide the firm through a period which it is now the
first to admit was 'awful'.
Kleinwort's privatisation experience also pushed it to embrace the idea of
departments organised around sectors. 'Everybody says they do it now. We
were very early,' says Mr Robertson.
One key question remains. Advisory work on privatisation allows investment
banks to establish close contact with company managements. It is not in
itself the most lucrative part of investment banking.
The pay-off often comes in ongoing business, such as capital raising
exercises. US investment bankers wonder whether Kleinwort and Rothschild may
not be too specialised to do that.
