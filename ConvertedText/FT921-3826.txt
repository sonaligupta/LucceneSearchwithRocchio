FT  12 MAR 92 / Telecom joint venture for French and Germans


   By WILLIAM DAWKINS


   PARIS


FRANCE TELECOM and Deutsche Telekom, the French and German
telecommunications operators, yesterday announced agreement in principle on
a joint venture to provide worldwide services for international companies.
The Franco-German partnership, to be called Eunetcom, is the latest in a
series of international partnerships by telecom monopolies, as they seek to
compete against each other in foreign markets and provide worldwide
services.
The alliance also strengthens France Telecom's hand in its campaign to join
Syncordia, the venture set up by British Telecom, the UK operator, in
Atlanta, Georgia, last year, to manage voice, data and video links for
multinational companies.
Eunetcom, to be equally owned by its partners, is to be in place in three
months and will undertake the provision of international telecommunications
services for multinationals, said the partners.
