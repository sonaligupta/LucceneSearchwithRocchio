FT  20 APR 91 / UK Company News: Borrowing costs take toll on Roskel profits


   By STEVEN WATKINS


BORROWING costs at Roskel, the USM-quoted group which installs suspended
ceilings and partitions, caused 1990 pre-tax profits to fall 26 per cent
after five years of growth.
Mr Simon Skelding, chairman and managing director, said the figure of Pounds
2.18m (Pounds 2.93m) was 'creditable' in a difficult year. Operating profits
were up 8 per cent to Pounds 3.04m, helped by stricter management controls
and reduced overheads, although there was an escalation in the provision for
bad debts.
Assisted by each of the group's three operating companies, and in particular
by contract business with major retailers, turnover rose by 47 per cent from
Pounds 31.3m to Pounds 46.22m, in line with the group's objective of rapid
sales growth.
Earnings per share fell to 11.01p (15.12p). The final dividend is 3p making
an unchanged total of 4.3p.
