IBM yesterday demonstrated advances in its speech recognition technology
that will lead to the availability within the next 12 months of
high-performance speech-to-text translation on low-cost personal computers.
The demonstrations included a dictation version of WordPerfect, one of the
most popular PC word processing programs. IBM's technology provides a
vocabulary of up to 32,000 words and can take dictation at a rate of about
70 words a minute.
Users train the system to recognise their own voice.
Promising applications of the speech recognition technology include its use
by doctors, police, social services personnel and lawyers, Mr Sherwin
predicts.
IBM also demonstrated the use of 'continuous speech' recognition to create
and manipulate data using Lotus 1-2-3, the leading PC spreadsheet program.
Atari, the video-game manufacturer, said IBM is to manufacture a new TV game
system, the Atari Jaguar. It will be made at an IBM plant in North Carolina.
Atari valued the agreement at Dollars 500m.
