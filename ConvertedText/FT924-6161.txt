FT  23 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Switzerland


The gossip in the Swiss equity market is that investors are discounting a
'no' vote in next month's referendum on joining the European economic area.
The market has fallen more than 3 per cent since early November, ostensibly
on worries about the threat to investment, jobs and growth from remaining
outside. On closer examination this theory looks a little flawed.
The vote will have little impact on the earnings prospects of large Swiss
companies and banks which are well-implanted within the EC. At greater risk
are small and medium-sized companies in the engineering sector, particularly
those which rely on government procurement contracts. Yet even these worries
are easily exaggerated.
More important for equities, though, may be the interest rate trend. The
market was discouraged by an uptick of about half a point in Eurofranc rates
since late October as the Swiss National Bank responded to franc weakness
against the D-Mark.
Significantly, share prices recovered towards the end of last week as the
central bank, which is increasingly pessimistic about the domestic economy,
injected liquidity into the money market. It may have further opportunities
to do so if turmoil in the ERM keeps the franc strong. From this
perspective, a 'no' vote which emphasised Switzerland's distinctiveness
might even help the equity market.
