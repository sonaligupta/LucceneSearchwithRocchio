FT  16 JAN 92 / Liverpool poll tax hearings adjourned


THE HOME Office was last night urgently considering possible action after
the first of thousands of poll tax cases due to be heard in Liverpool was
adjourned after a claim that the city council's computer evidence against
alleged defaulters was inadmissible.
The Home Office said: 'Although it is not for the Home Office to interpret
the law, we have no reason to suppose that computer-generated records are
not admissible in civil proceedings, in accordance with the provisions of
the Evidence Act 1938.'
Magistrates in Liverpool decided to postpone for two weeks more than 200
cases of non-payment and await a decision expected next week about similar
prosecutions in Camden, north London.
About 250 of the 5,500 people summoned in Liverpool arrived for the hearings
at specially convened courts. Those who did not attend will be issued with
liability orders.
Mr Jo Cooper, who represented Ms Lesley Mahmood, a leftwing councillor and
former by-election candidate, met the council's legal representatives for
more than an hour before the cases were adjourned.
More than 145,000 people in Liverpool may be prosecuted for non-payment of
poll tax in an attempt to recover an estimated Pounds 90m in unpaid tax.
