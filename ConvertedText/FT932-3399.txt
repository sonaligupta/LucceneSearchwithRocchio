FT  15 JUN 93 / Recession forces France to trim interest rates


   By DAVID BUCHAN


   PARIS


FRANCE yesterday lowered a key official interest rate to combat deepening
recession in the economy.
The Bank of France cut the intervention rate, at which it meets most of the
financing needs of French banks, from 7.5 to 7.25 per cent, and its 5-10 day
repurchase rate from 8.5 to 8.25 per cent. The main commercial banks said
they would cut their base rates from 8.8 to 8.6 per cent on Thursday.
Last time the French authorities took the gamble of letting their rates fall
below those of Germany - in October 1991 - they had to raise them a month
later. This time, however, the rate reductions, which were welcomed Mr Hans
Tietmeyer, deputy Bundesbank president, look likely to stick, with the franc
staying strong inside the ERM yesterday.
In an interview before the new rates were announced, Mr Nicolas Sarkozy,
budget minister, said that, given this year's expected FFr317bn (Pounds
38bn) budget deficit, 'there is no more room in the budget other than that
we have already used' to try to lift the economy out of recession. He
acknowledged the reversal in policy: 'We came to power convinced of the need
to cut taxes, only to find we had to do the opposite to save social
programmes.'
For his part, Mr Edouard Balladur, prime minister, pleaded yesterday for
people to withold judgment on his jobs and economic recovery programme until
September because it could not produce any effects before then. Mr Sarkozy
forecast the programme's first results would not be evident until early
1994.
The government looks set later this week to revise its estimate of the
contraction in goods and services traded this year from 0.4 per cent to 0.8
per cent. However, it is pressing on with its programme to privatise some 21
state companies and to give the Bank of France autonomy in monetary policy.
