FT  08 NOV 94 / Japan, US start joint exercise


   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

Japan and the US will today begin their largest joint military exercise, a
sign of their wish to keep trade tensions separate from strategic links.
More than 26,000 men, roughly half from each side, will take part in the
exercise, called Keen Edge 1995, over the next five days in northern Japan.
The aim of the exercise, part of a series started in 1986, is to defend
Japan from an imaginary invasion by sea and air.
This latest exercise, planned last year, coincides with a visit yesterday by
Mr Walter Slocombe, US under-secretary of defence, designed to bolster
US-Japan security co-operation.
After a meeting with Mr Yohei Kono, the foreign minister, Mr Slocombe called
for more co-operation between the two countries in international
peacekeeping and the prevention of the spread of weapons of mass
destruction.
The military manoeuvres are the latest reminder of the sharp policy switch
by Mr Tomiichi Murayama, Japan's socialist prime minister.
Mr Murayama used to oppose the US-Japan defence treaty and Japan's right to
maintain military forces, but soon dropped those policies after coming to
power in June, in order to fall into line with his conservative Liberal
Democratic party coalition partners.
