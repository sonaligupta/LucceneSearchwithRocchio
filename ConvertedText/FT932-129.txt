FT  30 JUN 93 / Observer: Cannon fodder


What next for Devenish chairman Michael Cannon after he sells his chain of
550 West Country pubs to Greenalls? He is showing a Pounds 26m profit on a
business which started with a Pounds 30,000 investment in a Bristol pub in
1976. He could be forgiven for wanting to retire to the other side of the
bar.
However, the diminutive and dapper Cannon has no intention of retiring at
54. He was one of the first to recognise that several pints of beer was not
enough to satisfy changing consumer attitudes and has been leading the
retailing revolution in Britain's pub trade.
'We became known for red lampshades and subdued lighting - but who wants to
go to a pub and feel they're under the spotlights at the Hippodrome?' Like
Marks & Spencer, Cannon tries to stay a step ahead of rivals by offering
something different. 'You have to be better than the next pub, but you don't
have to be much better to succeed.' Let's hope, for Greenalls' sake, that he
doesn't desert to the opposition.
