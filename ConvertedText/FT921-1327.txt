FT  25 MAR 92 / Cut in jobs at Swan Hunter


   By CHRIS TIGHE


SWAN HUNTER, the Tyneside shipbuilder, announced 95 white-collar
redundancies yesterday.
The job cuts, affecting management, technical and clerical staff, arise from
a gap in the order book at the company, which won its last shipbuilding
contract - for three Type 23 frigates for the Ministry of Defence - in
December 1989.
Swan Hunter, privatised in a management buyout six years ago, has fought to
cut its dependence on UK warship orders. It has hopes for its first overseas
ship order since privatisation, a Pounds 200m deal from Singapore for 12
vessels.
