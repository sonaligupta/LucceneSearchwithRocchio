FT  02 JUL 92 / Mirror vote on walk-out


JOURNALISTS at Mirror Group Newspapers last night decided against going on
strike in an effort to force the resignation of the group's board. They also
voted unanimously to urge Mr Vic Horwood, MGN chief executive, and Mr Ernest
Burrington, former chairman, to forgo their recent pay rises, said by
journalists' representatives to be 56 per cent for Mr Horwood and at least
17 per cent for Mr Burrington.
Sir Robert Clark, MGN's new chairman, said the increases were justified
because of promotion and 'extra duties'.
