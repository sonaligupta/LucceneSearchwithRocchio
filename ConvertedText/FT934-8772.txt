FT  13 NOV 93 / Money Markets: German call rate slips


   By CONNER MIDDELMANN


The rate for overnight D-Mark funds slid further yesterday, raising hopes of
a more substantial easing at next week's Bundesbank securities repurchase
agreements, writes Conner Middelmann.
In a market awash with liquidity, the call money rate fell to around 6.25
per cent in late trading, down 0.20 points in the last two days. Despite the
outflow of funds in payment for the Treuhandanstalt's new bonds, liquidity
was ample, boosted among other factors by banks' well-stocked reserves at
the central bank. Reserves totaled DM59.1bn on Wednesday, the last day for
which data is available, up from DM58.8bn on Tuesday.
Given the softness in call money rates, next week's round of repos - which
has been moved forward by one day due to Wednesday's national holiday - is
expected to yield a larger drop in the repo rate than this week's one basis
point reduction. Many dealers are betting on a 5 to 10 basis point reduction
in the lowest-accepted rate from this week's 6.38 per cent.
The December three-month Euromark futures contract rose 0.04 point to 93.89.
As expected, the Bank of France at its latest open-market operation left its
key money market rates unchanged and added FFr1bn in liquidity. The Bank of
France is seen to want to keep rates steady so as not to upset the foreign
exchange market while it continues to rebuild its foreign currency reserves.
The Bank of France's weekly statement, published yesterday, showed that the
country's net currency reserves rose by FFr4.8bn in the week to October 28,
leaving the reserves still FFr28.2bn in deficit.
'It's quite disappointing - they don't seem to be taking advantage of the
D-Mark's weakness against the dollar to accelerate the rebuilding
programme,' said Mr Chris Turner, a currency strategist at Barclays de Zoete
Wedd Securities.
The three-month Pibor future rose 0.03 points to 93.53.
After tightness earlier in the week, Sterling money market rates softened
slightly after a large institution took out the bulk of the Pounds 1.5bn
shortage announced early in the day, traders said.
In the early round of operations the Bank purchased Pounds 1.25bn of bills
at an interest rate of 5 29/32 per cent, followed by another Pounds 150m of
bills at 5 7/8 per cent.
The December short sterling futures contract rose 0.05 points on strong
volume to 94.45.
