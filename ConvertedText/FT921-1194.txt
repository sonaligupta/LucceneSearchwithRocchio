FT  25 MAR 92 / Electoral upset for S Korean ruling party


   By REUTER


   SEOUL


SOUTH KOREA'S ruling Democratic Liberal Party appeared to have lost control
of parliament in a humilating general election defeat for President Roh
Tae-woo, state television projections said, Reuter reports from Seoul.
With about 94 per cent of votes in yesterday's poll counted, the DLP, which
holds a two-thirds majority in the outgoing single-chamber National
Assembly, looked set to win 114 of 237 constituencies, with the opposition
and various independents taking the rest, the Korea Broadcasting System
said.
More than 1,000 candidates stood in 237 constituencies. Another 62 seats, to
make a total of 299, will be filled from party lists in proportion to the
overall vote.
'Voters have rebelled against President Roh's government for its failure to
manage the economy properly,' said Mr Kim Yong-jin, a Seoul university
professor. 'The DLP failed to contain mounting concerns by voters about high
prices and sluggish exports, a main theme in the election campaign.'
KBS said the DLP was likely to receive 33 seats under proportional
representation, for a total of 147, three seats short of the 150 needed for
an overall majority.
The Democratic Party, headed by a veteran opposition leader, Mr Kim
Dae-jung, was expected to form the next biggest bloc with 100, followed by
30 for the Unification National Party of Mr Chung Ju-yung, retired chairman
of Hyundai, the South Korean conglomerate, KBS said.
'The voters supported our platform that a strong opposition is needed to
check the giant ruling party,' Mr Kim told reporters with a smile. His
party's candidates swept most of the seats in Kim's south-western stronghold
of Cholla and took more than 60 per cent of 44 seats at stake in Seoul.
Independents also did unexpectedly well and were projected to gain about 21
seats. One remaining seat went to a minority party candidate.
