FT  12 MAR 94 / TGWU launches probe over funds


   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff


Britain's second largest union yesterday launched an investigation into
alleged misuse of union funds by officials on Merseyside and Manchester.
The investigation is at present internal but it is understood that Mr Bill
Morris, TGWU general secretary, will call in the police if necessary.
Three officials from the north-west region of the TGWU general union are to
be questioned by Mr Albert Blyghton, the union's legal secretary, over a
number of issues including alleged intimidation of members during recent
elections for the union's general council. It is understood that the
allegations are not against the elected council members.
Nobody has been suspended and Mr Bob Owens, the regional secretary, is not
under investigation. Mr Morris said: 'The leadership . . . is acting to
defend the integrity of the union.'
Among the allegations is that a grant of Pounds 53,000 from the European
Union, given for training shop stewards, was transferred into a non-union
account and has gone missing.
The union had also been paying money to members involved in a dispute at a
cleaning company on Merseyside but has been unable to check details of how
many members are involved.
The investigation will also look at payments to TGWU members involved in a
three-year dispute at a Merseyside company. More than Pounds 300,000 in
strike pay has already been paid without a firm record of how many were
involved in the strike.
Another allegation is that an advertising company paid the union to carry
advertisements on taxis driven by TGWU members, but the contract was never
fulfilled.
