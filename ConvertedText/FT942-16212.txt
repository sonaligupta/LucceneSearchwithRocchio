FT  12 APR 94 / Belgians in Kigali operation

   BRUSSELS


Belgian paratroopers were yesterday beginning a high-risk operation to
rescue the remaining foreign nationals scattered across the Rwandan capital,
Kigali, the scene of bloody inter-tribal massacres.
But with the Rwandan rebels reported to be marching on the capital,
prompting fears of further clashes, the Belgian defence ministry said of
foreigners trapped in outlying areas: 'We do not envisage for the moment
pushing our action further than Kigali - it is not possible given the
difficulties we are experiencing in Kigali itself.'
The first group of Belgians to leave Rwanda yesterday were returned to
Brussels, with several hundred more expected to be evacuated from the centre
of Kigali later today. Several hundred French and US nationals also left
Rwanda yesterday.
There are currently 400 Belgian paratroopers in Kigali.
