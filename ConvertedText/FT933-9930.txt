FT  06 AUG 93 / UK Company News: TR City of London net assets up


TR CITY of London Trust lifted net asset value by 18.5 per cent, from 112.8p
to 133.64p per share, over the 12 months to June 30.
The return, including reinvestment of dividends, amounted to 23.3 per cent,
again outperforming the FT-A All-Share Index.
Reduced dividend income, especially from higher yielding equities, and lower
bank deposit interest received left net revenue at Pounds 9.02m (Pounds
9.26m) for earnings of 4.59p (4.76p) per share.
A fourth interim dividend of 1.23p brings the total for the year to 4.8p
(4.76p); directors anticipate a total of not less than 4.92p for the current
year.
