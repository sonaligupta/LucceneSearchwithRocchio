FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (8): Funding outstrips demand
 -The Midlands / Paul Cheeseright looks at the activity in this region


   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT


Funding for management buy-ins and buy-outs in the UK midlands has
outstripped the demand, in spite of the upturn in corporate activity as
economic confidence seeped back into the regions.
This is not surprising. There was an upsurge of activity in the first half
of the year but an easing off in the number of deals during the third
quarter.
Nottingham University's Centre for Management Buy-out Research, funded by
Barclays Development Capital and accountants Touche Ross, established that,
during the buoyant first half, the main activity on the market shifted from
London and south-east England to the Midlands. In the West Midlands,
activity was 13.8 per cent higher than in 1993, while in the East Midlands
the rise was 9 per cent.
This greater concentration of activity in the regions has been picked up by
NatWest Ventures, the venture capital arm of National Westminster Bank,
which claims to be second after 3i among venture capitalists in the scope of
its regional office network.
Of the Pounds 74m it has invested in 29 management buy-outs and buy-ins this
year, 18 deals with investment of Pounds 41m have been completed by its
regional office network.
Certainly, venture capitalists are more active in the sector as corporate
activity gathers pace. 'We invested as much in the first six months of this
year as in the whole of 1993,' reported Chris Rowlands, regional director of
3i in Birmingham. Nottingham University calculated that venture capitalists
were involved in financing 47.9 per cent of all management buy-outs during
the first half, compared to 35.7 per cent in 1993.
Accountants Price Waterhouse tracked in the East Midlands 11 management
buy-outs and buy-ins during the first quarter of this year, seven in the
second quarter but only five in the third quarter.
In the West Midlands, Price Waterhouse said there were 13 buy-outs and
buy-ins during the first quarter, valued at Pounds 24.7m, 21 worth Pounds
83.9m in the second quarter but only 10, valued at Pounds 139.9m, during the
third quarter. The abnormally high value of the transactions during the
third quarter came because of the Pounds 94m buy-out of Dollond & Aitchison,
the optical group, from Gallaher.
The explanation for the third quarter decline is not clear. Certainly it was
part of a more general fall in the level of corporate management and
acquisitions activity. But, said Price Waterhouse, 'the fundamentals for
increased activity in the region remain in place. We consider it likely that
the fall in completed deals during the last quarter is short term and,
cumulatively, the volume of transactions will remain ahead of last year.'
The money is ready to finance the transactions. 'There is no shortage of
capital,' said Mr Rowlands. 'The demand by companies for new funds is
lagging behind the banks' willingness to lend,' said John Gregory, director
in Birmingham of Singer & Friedlander, merchant bankers, and chairman of the
West Midlands Bankers' Association.
The association surveys showed, Mr Gregory said, that 'the provision of
derivatives and other Treasury products is increasing, alongside project and
trade finance as well as mezzanine debt and management buy-out leveraged
lending, often involving equity in the form of development capital. However,
many banks are still cautious about sectors related to the leisure industry
and hotels, or high-tech industries and speculative property transactions.'
Where management buy-outs and buy-ins are taking place, there has been a
growing emphasis on deals involving medium-sized companies. Nottingham
University's research centre reported that deals ranging from Pounds 5m to
Pounds 25m accounted for 20.7 per cent of the total value of buy-outs during
the first half.
'Traditionally, deals in the regions have generally been of smaller size
than those done out of the London office. This has not been the case
recently,' according to NatWest Ventures, which said that, of the 18
regional deals it has transacted this year, eight involved more than Pounds
10m and three more than Pounds 20m.
This may reflect, of course, the greater importance which the financial
institutions are giving to the regional market. 'Over the last 18-24 months,
there has been a significant change in the way the mid-size corporate deals
 -for companies with turnover between Pounds 15m and Pounds 50m - are being
done. Predominantly they are being handled by regional professionals. What
are organisations going to do if they are based only in London?' asked Mr
Rowlands.
Recent deals have shown the growing reliance on regionally-based advice
mixed with capital and loan funding from the branches of the London
financial institutions.
In November, the managers of Rubicon Packaging at Mountsorrel near
Loughborough, a company with annual turnover of Pounds 11m, used KPMG
Corporate Finance in Leicester to negotiate and structure a buy-out which
drew in equity finance from Barclays Development Capital, loan finance from
the Bank of Scotland, Leicester, and lease finance from NWS Bank.
In October, Price Waterhouse, Nottingham, completed a buy-out deal for the
managers of Intermotor, the Nottingham automotive electrical component
manufacturer, which involved Pounds 15m in total funding. Equity came from a
syndicate led by Gresham Trust and comprising Candover 1991 Fund and
Threadneedle Investment Managers, which is part of Eagle Star, the insurance
group.
But the most famous buy-out and the deal about which Midlands financial
groups crowed loudest, not least because of the sentimental hold the company
has on Birmingham, was the Pounds 40m buy-out from the receivers in April
1993 of Leyland Daf Vans.
For that Coopers & Lybrand, Birmingham, structured a package which brought
in equity capital from 3i's regional office, loan funding from Royal Bank of
Scotland, Birmingham, and United Dominions Trust, a land purchase which had
the effect of providing new working capital by Birmingham Heartlands
Development Corporation and regional selective assistance from the local
office of the Department of Trade and Industry.
