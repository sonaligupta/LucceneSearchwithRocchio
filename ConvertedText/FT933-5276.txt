FT  04 SEP 93 / EC to probe glass merger


   By ANDREW HILL


   BRUSSELS


THE European Commission has opened a full inquiry into the proposed
acquisition of Societa Italiana Vetro, Italian state glass company, by
Pilkington, UK glass group, and Techint Finanziaria, its Italian-Argentine
partner, writes Andrew Hill in Brussels.
The L210bn (Pounds 87m) deal will be suspended for up to four months, while
the Commission's merger control task force assesses its impact on
competition in the EC. The buyers provided for regulatory delays when
drawing up the purchase contract.
If the Commission decides the takeover is anti-competitive it could ask for
changes to the deal or block it outright. Brussels has only outlawed one
proposed merger in the three years since the EC merger regulation took
effect.
The Brussels authorities did not explain their initial doubts about the
deal. Following a month-long preliminary investigation, the Commission said
the merger would cut the number of 'major Community (flat glass) suppliers'
to five, and give Pilkington a position very close to the market leader,
Saint Gobain of France.
The sale of SIV is the first large disposal in the liquidation of Efim, the
Italian state holding company. It would raise Pilkington's profile in Italy
and Spain and strengthen its position in automotive glass. SIV is the
biggest European producer of car glass.
