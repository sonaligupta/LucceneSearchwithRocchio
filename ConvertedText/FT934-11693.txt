FT  29 OCT 93 / Baby dies as Serbs bar safe passage

A SICK Moslem infant died yesterday, after local Serb commanders blocked his
evacuation from Gorazde, a Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia, for medical
treatment in the west.
The one-year-old baby, Mohamet Rasenica, was tucked into a French army
convoy bound for Sarajevo, after Serb chieftains in Pale, their mountain
stronghold, gave permission for him to be evacuated with four other
critically ill patients.
UN relief officials yesterday were outraged by Mohamet's death, which
follows a similar case earlier this month when a two-year-old Moslem girl
died in Zepa, a nearby Moslem enclave also designated a UN safe area. In
both instances, Serb leaders gave permission for the medical evacuation of
besieged Moslems, only to block it hours later.
Doctors said the patients could be easily treated in normally-equipped
hospitals instead of in the Moslem enclaves. 'This child would not have died
if he had been able to get proper medical treatment,' said one.
Serb leaders routinely block the passage of medical supplies, food and
building materials desperately needed for the UN 'safe areas', cut off from
the outside world except when Serb authorities allow access.
