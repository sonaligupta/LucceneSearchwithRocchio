FT  23 JUL 93 / International Company News: Perella to quit Wasserstein


   By KAREN ZAGOR


MR JOSEPH PERELLA, one of the most prominent figures in US investment
banking, is leaving Wasserstein, Perella, the firm he formed with Bruce
Wasserstein in 1988.
'Wasserella' was involved in many of the biggest deals of the 1980s,
including Time's Dollars 13.4bn bid for Warner Communications and the
Dollars 25bn bid by Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts for RJR Nabisco. In 1989, the
firm fought for control of the UK's Gateway, and later invested a third of
its Dollars 1.1bn buy-out fund in subscribing for a 40 per cent share of
Isosceles' equity.
The firm's profile has fallen sharply in recent years, and several of
Wasserella's top investment bankers have defected. Mr Perella, who has
started working with Mr Wasserstein at First Boston in 1977, has threatened
to quit in the past. Yesterday he said he wanted to seek challenges and new
business ventures.
