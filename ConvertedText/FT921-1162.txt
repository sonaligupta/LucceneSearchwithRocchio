FT  25 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Thatcher defends the union


MRS Margaret Thatcher said in Scotland yesterday that she did not believe
Scots would abandon the union of the United Kingdom by choosing
independence. She said: 'The union has done wonderful things for us all over
the centuries. People may talk about breaking it but when it really comes to
the point they will realise that you don't jettison something that has
brought the world so much.'
