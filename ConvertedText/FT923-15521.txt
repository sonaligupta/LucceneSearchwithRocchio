FT  01 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Renewed pressure on ICI


   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and COLIN MILLHAM


SUBSTANTIAL weakness in ICI, the chemicals giant, upset the market shortly
after the start of trading, when there was news of yet another brokerage
downgrade of the group's profits.
Smith New Court, the securities house, chopped its forecast for the current
year and also for next year. This move caused the shares to drop to 1198p
before stabilising to close a net 15 off at 1206p. Mr Charles Lambert, at
Smith, lowered his prediction for this year by Pounds 100m to Pounds 750m
and next year's by Pounds 150m to Pounds 900m. Both forecasts are around the
lowest in the market.
Mr Lambert attributed the downgrades to three factors. Firstly, that
earnings had been damaged by the anaemic US recovery and continued weakness
in the dollar, allied to a poor performance by the UK economy. Secondly, the
weakness in the crucial agrochemical business during the second quarter was
not simply weather-related but reflected price-cutting in the US. Thirdly,
generic competition to ICI's Tenormin drug had gathered pace.
There were also hints that ICI was about to bid for Fisons, the troubled
chemicals group; although not ruled out, such suggestions were deemed
premature by marketmakers. Nevertheless, Fisons climbed 12 to 212p on heavy
6.2m turnover.
Dealers also pointed to the bearish effects of a large overhang of ICI
shares, resulting from Goldman Sachs' purchase of Hanson's 2.82 per cent
stake in May. Goldman is believed to still be holding at least 10m ICI
shares.
BP rallies
British Petroleum recovered 3 1/2 to 203 1/2 p after company director Mr
Steve Ahearne addressed the Society of Inv-estment Analysts (SIA) in London.
While the share price picked up, however, after the steep decline caused by
last week's resignation of Mr Robert Horton as chairman and chief executive,
most oil analysts registered disappointment at Mr Ahearne's refusal to
discuss dividend policy or the departure of Mr Horton.
An oil sector analyst said: 'The seminar was peppered with slides and
speeches about corporate strategy, but what everybody was waiting to hear
was dividend policy; it is very frustrating.' He added that US investors
were showing increasing signs of getting cold feet about BP. Another
specialist, who attended the meeting, said he found it difficult to see why
the shares had bounced yesterday, adding: 'There was nothing new in what Mr
Ahearne said.'
Turnover in BP remained high, with 40m shares traded yesterday, following
110m last Friday and the 45m that changed hands on Monday. Japanese
institutions were said to be keen sellers, while at least two of the big US
investment banks apparently have been aggressive buyers of the shares.
Suggestions that a stake builder had been at work were disregarded.
Lonrho pleases
Eagerly awaited mid-term results from Lonrho, the international
conglomerate, cheered the market after the board reported figures above best
market expectations and announced a dividend payment.
Interim profits fell to Pounds 38m, from Pounds 109m at the same stage last
year, but market predictions were in the range of Pounds 25m to Pounds 35m.
An interim dividend of 2p, although reduced from last year's two interim
payouts of 3p and 5p respectively, also surprised analysts, several having
predicted a dividend payment of no more than 1p.
Analysts were particularly pleased by the company's breakdown of the interim
figures, both geographical and by region for the first time.
The shares responded by improving 4 to 81p on the figures, but then
retreated on profit-taking to end only a penny up at 78p after brisk trade
of 5.6m. Mr Rob Davis at US merchant bank Lehman Brothers said: 'I think the
worst is over. The refinery problems are behind the company and the second
half should be a lot better.'
Steel activity
Turnover in British Steel jumped to 38m in strong two-way business as the
shares experienced a volatile session. They fell 6 1/2 in early trade as
some dealers continued to reflect on the company's poor results announced on
Monday and the prospect of a dividend cut, a view that took hold after a
gloomy analysts' results meeting.
Bargain hunters moved in at midsession, however, and the upward momentum was
further boosted by US buying, which helped the shares rally to end unchanged
on balance at 60 1/2 p.
TSB featured prominently in the market's heavy programme trade and options
market activity, the shares eventually closing 7 higher at 141p with a hefty
5.1m changing hands.
Rumours that SmithKline Beecham was about to be included in County NatWest's
prestigious Top 30 list boosted the shares by 20 to 893p.
Scottish Power was given a strong push by Nomura, the Japanese broking
house, and the shares ran up 2 1/2 to 182p on good turnover of 1.8m.
Nomura's utilities team said the stock had been left behind in the post-BP
upsurge by other electricity and generator stocks.
Shares in BM Group continued to slide, falling 37 to 113p in turnover of
3.1m.
MicroFocus shares shrugged off the recent bout of weakness and jumped 83 to
1733p after a positive meeting with County NatWest.
The recent improvement in copper prices was appreciated by investors in RTZ,
the world's biggest mining company, and led to a demand for stock which
caused a squeeze. The shares appreciated 18 to end at 625p.
Kingfisher weakened 8 to 496p following a profits downgrading from County
NatWest. Its forecast for the current year has been cut by Pounds 13m to
Pounds 229m and that for 1993/94 by Pounds 20m to Pounds 250m.
Ms Kimlan Cook, stores analyst at County, said the downgrade mainly
reflected concern about a DIY price war involving the company's B & Q
subsidiary.
Sears was steady at 84p in average trading of 2.7m shares, as chairman Mr
Geoffrey Maitland Smith told the annual meeting that trading has been flat
for the first five months of this financial year.
Profits downgrades continued to depress United Biscuits. The shares dipped 4
to 352p as County NatWest and Smith New Court followed other securities
houses in cutting estimates of 1992 profits.
