FT  22 APR 91 / Right gains in Icelandic election


   By ROBERT TAYLOR

THE right-wing Independence Party failed at the weekend to win the runaway
victory in Iceland's general election predicted by most opinion polls, but
it did make big gains.
The party secured 38.6 per cent of the vote, compared with only 27.2 per
cent four years ago, and won an extra eight seats to finish with 26 in the
63-member parliament.
But the three parties in the country's current coalition government
performed better than expected, securing 32 seats between them, or one more
than an overall majority. The centrist Progressive party and the Social
Democrats polled 18.9 per cent and 15.5 per cent respectively - close to the
1987 result. The left-wing People's Alliance improved its position with 14.4
per cent.
The Women's Movement suffered a slight setback, polling 8.3 per cent (down
from 10.8 per cent) and losing one seat.
