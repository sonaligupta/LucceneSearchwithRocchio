FT  16 NOV 93 / International Company News: Holderbank expects further gains


   By IAN RODGER


   ZURICH


HOLDERBANK, one of the world's largest cement producers, has forecast a 3.9
per cent rise in consolidated net profit to SFr405m (Dollars 270m) in 1993
and held out the prospect of further gains in 1994.
Mr Thomas Schmidheiny, chairman of the Swiss group, called this year's
expected profit rise satisfactory, considering the 'extremely difficult
conditions' in many construction markets.
Mr Schmidheiny said he could foresee a dividend increase, but was not
specific.
Cement shipments would rise 5.8 per cent to 45.6m tonnes and deliveries of
ready mixed concrete would advance 5.3 per cent to 13.9m tonnes.
The gains were coming mainly from the US and Latin American markets. Apart
from eastern Germany where sales were 35 per cent ahead of last year,
European markets were depressed.
Holderbank has operations in 30 countries, and minority interests will claim
34.6 per cent of this year's net income.
Mr Max Amstutz, deputy chief executive, said the group anticipated that the
US Holnam subsidiary and St Lawrence Cement in Canada would return to profit
next year.
Swiss Bank Corporation has made an agreed bid to acquire Seeland Bank, a
struggling Swiss regional bank based in Biel with total assets of close to
SFr5bn.
The share and cash offer values the bank at SFr193.9m.
