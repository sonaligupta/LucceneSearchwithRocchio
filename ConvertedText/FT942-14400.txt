FT  20 APR 94 / International Capital Markets: Chinese offered London
listings

The London Stock Exchange yesterday made a strong pitch for Chinese
companies to consider dual listings in both Hong Kong and London.
Mr Nigel Atkinson, head of listings in London, said in Beijing that Chinese
companies seeking capital abroad could 'get two listings for the price of
one' in Hong Kong and London, since listing requirements on the two
exchanges were complementary.
The London Stock Exchange conducted a one-day seminar, attended by Chinese
stock regulators and securities representatives, to promote its attractions
as a centre for international listings.
London lists 480 international companies, three times as many as New York
and four times as many as Tokyo. It accounts for 60 per cent of world trade
in international securities, Mr Atkins said.
Mr Atkinson said the London Stock Exchange was open to various options,
including primary, secondary or dual listings. No Chinese company has yet
listed in London, but three bond issues are being traded.
The Beijing listings seminar follows a visit to China last month by Sir
Andrew Hugh Smith, chairman of the London Stock Exchange. Sir Andrew signed
a memorandum of understanding with the Shanghai Stock Exchange aimed at
facilitating contacts and exchanges of information.
China's Securities Regulatory Commission has approved the listing abroad of
22 companies, of which several are expected to seek listings in New York.
Over the past year six mainland companies have been listed in Hong Kong.
