FT  23 APR 93 / Letter: Group 4 confident of courts service


   From Mr M J HIRST


Sir, I read with interest your leader 'Prison Leaks' (April 21) which
clearly outlines the complexities of the contract awarded to Group 4 to
pioneer the first private court services operation of its kind in the world.
I would like to clarify, however, the escapes to which you refer in the
first paragraph.
Over the 16 court sitting days that Group 4 has been providing the service
there have been four court room escapes directly attributable to it,
including one during which a custody officer was assaulted and the clerk of
the court later commented: 'The Group 4 officers acted in a proper manner
and could not be faulted for the defendant escaping.'
The vehicles from which there were two escapes have been officially
acknowledged as being of faulty Home Office design brief and specification.
Modifications have been made. In addition, a prisoner was released from
Mansfield Magistrates Court as it was not made known at the time that he was
required to appear in another court there to answer a different charge. The
clerk to the court has written to Group 4 clarifying the procedural error
and clearing the company of any blame.
A further incident was reported on April 10 regarding our staff's releasing
a prisoner on theft charges. He was correctly released as he was bailed
subject to regular appearances at the police station.
I am confident, however, that our systems and procedures, which are all
agreed and monitored by the Home Office, are fundamentally sound and our
staff are properly trained to do the job. If all agencies (police, courts
and prison service) within the contract meet their requirements, we can
continue to improve the service that we are providing.
M J Hirst,
director of Group 4 Court
Services,
