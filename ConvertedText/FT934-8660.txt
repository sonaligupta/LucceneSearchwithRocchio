FT  13 NOV 93 / Pink Snow - FT Guide To The World's Best Ski Resorts (1):
Twin peaks for Val d'Isere - Arnie Wilson analyses this year's Pink Snow
resort and tour operator ratings


   By ARNIE WILSON


ONCE AGAIN the big French resorts, with Val d'Isere taking first place as
last year, have dominated the Pink Snow FT readers' questionnaire - with one
exception: Zermatt, the great British favourite in Switzerland, has
leap-frogged Courchevel and Meribel and is snapping at Val's heels. Verbier
has slipped from fourth to fifth place.
Val d'Isere's neighbour Tignes, however, which was fifth last year, has
inexplicably dropped out of sight - to 44th equal. Seven French resorts
figure in our Top 15, and if the votes for Courchevel, Meribel and Val
Thorens are pooled, the Trois Vallees resorts score a total of 111, which
leaves the rest trailing.
It is therefore perhaps no accident that a luxury ski tour operator
specialising in France - The Ski Company, with seven chalets in the French
Alps - has topped the poll for the best tour operator with a remarkable 97
per cent of the possible maximum score. Even more impressive, this high
score was achieved from pooling the satisfaction ratings of a total of 28
readers who mentioned the operator in their returned Pink Snow
questionnaires.
As well as general questions about skiing ability, our Pink Snow
questionnaire asked FT readers to nominate their favourite resort and also
to give a 'satisfaction rating' to tour operators they had skied with in the
past five years. These responses were collated, converted into percentages
and used to draw up the tables opposite, grading operators with more than 20
mentions ('The Big League') and those smaller, mainly specialist operators,
with fewer than 20 mentions ('The General League'). Fuller details of how
operators were graded can be found in the footnote to the Big League table.
Of those operators mentioned fewer than 20 times, two other French
specialists, Collineige and Ski Weekend, both achieved an excellent 95 per
cent - although bear in mind that both companies achieved their high ratings
from a total of only five readers' submitted satisfaction ratings.
Other companies that are strong in France were not far behind: YSE, (83 per
cent) which operates solely in Val d'Isere, Club Med (81 per cent) and Ski
Esprit (71 per cent) all finished strongly.
The French resort of Chamonix, featured by Collineige, climbed from 16th
position last year to eighth. In a letter to Pink Snow outlining his likes
and dislikes about skiing, FT reader David Maule raved about its most famous
off-piste run: 'I was in Heaven skiing the Vallee Blanche,' he wrote,
although he admitted that early on in this 17-kilometre marathon he was
'crying in pain during some of the worst moments of my life' during the
long, cold walk along the steep ridge to reach it. Meanwhile, the hordes of
skiers further down in the resort reminded him of Jean-Paul Sartre's famous
quote: 'Hell is other people.'
In keeping with the good showing by Zermatt and Verbier, the Swiss Travel
Service (91 per cent rating from an impressive 37 Pink Snow respondents)
keeps up its excellent record by finishing second in our 'Big League' table
of tour operators and fifth overall. Ski Weekend (95 per cent), Ski Scott
Dunn (90 per cent) and Kuoni (86 per cent) also scored high marks.
Silver Ski, 31st last year has shot up to eighth this time with an
impressive 84 per cent. Ski West improved on last year, rising 13 places to
22nd and its owners Bladon Lines has climbed six places to 21st.
America is exerting an ever more noticable influence on FT readers' choice
of top resorts, with two Colorado hotspots, Vail and Breckenridge, in the
top 15 of favourite resorts.
Vail rises from ninth to seventh. Virgin Holidays, which specialises in
Californian skiing, also achieved a high-scoring 92 per cent. The growing
appeal of skiing in the US is explained in an article on page 18 of Pink
Snow.
Not all readers, however found America ideal. Mr G Martin of Winchester
wrote: 'I skied in freezing drizzle on the East Coast. The only lift had
metal seats which were covered with ice, which I thawed with my bottom on
the way up. I recovered on the run down, only to be frozen rigid again up.'
However, he pointed out that if conditions are good, the skiing can be
outstanding.
Conversely, Italy - which, although thanks to a weak lira is set to enjoy a
skiing renaissance this winter - hardly gets a look-in on the basis of FT
readers' reported skiing experiences in the last five years. The highest
placed Italian resort is Cervinia at No. 27.
That will change this year. Tina Crowther, of the Skiers Travel Bureau in
Leeds, reports: 'Ski holidays to Italy are on a roll this season, and many
operators who used to have much larger Italian programmes must be kicking
themselves for reducing them in recent years.'
Italy's gains this year seem to be mainly at the expense of Austria whose
front-runner, St Anton, is in sixth place this year (up from eighth). Two
more Austrian resorts, Kitzbuhel (down two places) and Obergurgl, plus
Wengen (17th last year) in Switzerland - all traditional British favourites
 -fill 11th, 12th and 13th spot in this year's poll. Behind them are two
more French resorts, Alpe d'Huez (18th last year) and La Plagne (12th last
year). which are now equal 15th.
However, Austria is still favoured by many British skiers. Carole Emmett, of
Basildon, Essex, wrote to say that she particularly enjoyed the apres ski at
the Eidelweissam in Obertauern - 'the wildest place I have ever been to . .
. very few Brits; singing and dancing on tables in your thermals.' She also
likes the Cafe Christina at Ischgl - 'full of dancing, riotous, thumping
Germans drinking large beers.'
This year's most highly-praised tour-operator, The Ski Company, was started
by David Kemp on 'the first day of the recession' in 1987, and for a while
his office 'was a very lonely place.' Kemp, born in Zambia, did not even see
his first snow-flake until he came to Britain in 1969.
The Ski Company says it attempts to provide 'good food, fine wines and the
informality and privacy of a private house with the service of a private
hotel.' Says Kemp: 'Luxury does not mean going over the top. It is
understated good value. Hand-picked, well-trained staff, everything done
really well. Obviously our holidays are expensive because you cannot have
three people looking after eight guests in a chalet without it costing
something. But we've never had anyone who hasn't said our holidays are good
value.'
In contrast, a number of tour operators have experienced disappointing
results, particularly Touralp (satisfaction rating 39 per cent this year, as
against a top score last year, although that score was from only four
readers' mentions), and Crystal (46 per cent) which in spite of beating Ski
Thomson into second place in the recent Travel Trade Gazette Travel Awards
is still down among the tail-enders. Ski Thomson itself - the market leader
in terms of numbers of holidays sold - still languishes in the wrong half of
the table, albeit with a fairly reasonable rating of 66 per cent.
Andy Perrin, Crystal's marketing director, said he was 'gutted' by his
company's poor showing in the questionnaire.
'We have pulled out all the stops on customer satisfaction, and we were
delighted to beat Thomson at the TTG awards. I just can't understand these
figures. I can only assume that because skiers were asked to comment on
holidays taken in the last five years it's down to past problems still
catching up with us. We're definitely not the same company as we were four
or five years ago, but how do you get that message across to people?'
Touralp's apparent plunge in fortunes was 'not due to a drastic drop in
standards, as the results might imply,' claimed Pierre Espinasse, the
company's new general manager. It was not the skiing but delays in airport
transfers, - frequently a cause for disgruntlement among clients - that were
the chief bones of contention, it seems.
'In order to address this problem, Touralp has now completely done away with
group bus transfers and introduced a fly-drive programme giving our clients
the benefit of a hired car for a week,' says Espinasse. 'This cuts the wait
at the airport and people are free to drive to their resort in their own
time and visit neighbouring ski areas.'
Lotus Supertravel, which last year claimed to have been chosen by FT readers
as the 'Top British Tour Operator' fell from 15th last year to 19th, in
spite of a gallant attempt by Susan Burgin of south east London to give them
top rating. But then Ms Burgin is the company's marketing director, so a C
rating was unlikely.
Powder Byrne, too, was disappointed about slipping from second to 12th spot,
although the company scored a very creditable 77 per cent satisfaction
rating. 'We are not going to cut our throats over this,' said managing
director Rory Byrne. 'But we are going to do our damnest to get back to the
top. This kind of response keeps us on our toes.'
There will doubtless be arguments about our scoring system, which gives
considerable weight to dissatisfied customers. We think this gives a fair
reflection of the performance of larger operators, but operators with only a
few mentions might be unduly penalised by the rating of one or two
malcontents.
Nevertheless, with a total of more than 900 respondents to the
questionnaire, and with a very high proportion of those respondents giving
their views as paying customers of those tour operators mentioned, the
scores will give many companies food for thought. The customer is still
king, and any operator which rests on its laurels risks the wrath of those
who will send their verdicts to next year's Pink Snow . . .

Key: In the Pink Snow questionnaire FT readers were asked to rate ski
tour operators they had travelled with from A (excellent) to D (poor).
These ratings were converted to a score as follows: A=8; B=6; C=2; D=-2,
and this score was then expressed as a percentage. The survey reflects
the experiences of FT readers over the past five years. The management
of some companies has changed over that period. Operators no longer in
business have been excluded from the survey. A total of 938
questionnaires were returned. Not all readers expressed a view about
travel operators or favourite resort.
