FT  22 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Southend Property


Exceptional profits from the sale of a subsidiary and associated companies
enabled Southend Property Holdings to report pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.03m
for the year to end-March, against Pounds 513,000.
During the year, net asset value increased slightly to 94.2p, the company
said. The shares added 5p to close at 70p.
Operating profit advanced to Pounds 13.3m, against Pounds 12.7m which
included Pounds 295,000 from discontinued activities. However, there was a
profit of Pounds 3.94m (Pounds 36,000) on sales of investments in
subsidiaries and associates, offset by a loss on disposal of investment
properties.
The sales mean that for the first time in many years the figures from
non-property activities will not now be consolidated. In the year under
review the figures included only six months from Mt Martin Gold Mines.
Turnover was Pounds 22.2m, compared with Pounds 31.8m which included Pounds
4.19m from discontinued activities in non-property trading.
Earnings per share were 4.13p (losses 0.58p). A final dividend of 1.6p is
recommended for a total of 2.4p (4.25p).
