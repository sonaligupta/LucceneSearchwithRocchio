FT  22 JUL 94 / Inquiry on MPs' interests begins


   By DAVID OWEN


A top-level Commons inquiry which could lead to far-reaching changes in the
rules governing MPs' outside interests got under way at Westminster
yesterday as MPs packed their bags for the summer recess.
The powerful committee of privileges met privately for about an hour in a
discreet Commons committee room.
The meeting came less than 24 hours after Labour backbenchers were refused
their request that the inquiry into the so-called 'cash for questions'
affair be conducted by MPs with no outside business interests.
The committee is understood not to have agreed formal terms of reference for
its investigation but a number of MPs on it are expected to press for all
the areas outlined in a recent statement by Miss Betty Boothroyd, the
Speaker, to be included.
Miss Boothroyd, referring to a warning by another committee of MPs that 'a
financial inducement to take a particular course of action in parliament may
constitute a bribe', said there was 'an urgent need to clarify the law of
parliament' in some areas.
She said the committee, which would be chaired by Mr Tony Newton, the
Commons leader, would have the power to inquire 'not only into the matter of
the particular complaint, but also into facts surrounding and reasonably
connected with it, and into the principles of the law and custom of
privilege that are concerned'.
The inquiry arises from the action of two Conservative MPs - Mr Graham
Riddick and Mr David Tredinnick - who agreed to accept payments of Pounds
1,000 to table parliamentary questions.
