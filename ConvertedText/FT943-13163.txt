FT  21 JUL 94 / International Company News: Japan brokers face shake-up,
chief warns

   TOKYO


Continued sluggish trading in Japan's equity markets is likely to force a
reorganisation of Japan's brokerage industry, an industry official said
yesterday.
Mr Sadakane Doi, chairman of the Japan Securities Dealers' Association, told
a press conference that all brokers, including the Big Four - Nomura,
Yamaichi, Daiwa and Nikko - were facing 'extremely severe' conditions as
they approached the halfway point in the fiscal year at the end of
September. 'I think this could prompt mergers and acquisitions among
industry members,' he said.
Mr Doi also expressed concern about the entry into the securities market of
subsidiaries of banks, a development allowed under a programme of financial
deregulation.
