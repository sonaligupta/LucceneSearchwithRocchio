FT  19 APR 94 / Italian petrol strike starts


   By ROBERT GRAHAM


   ROME


Italy's road transport is expected to suffer serious disruptions from a
three-day strike by petrol station operators. The strike, which began at 7pm
yesterdayand is due to end at 7am on Friday,is the product of a long-running
dispute between petrol station operators and the oil companies. The
operators claim they are inadequately protected against price changes, but
the oil companies claim the strike is a disguised protest against efforts to
liberalise opening hours and operating conditions. The strike also reflects
the problems petrol stations operators foresee in dealing with full price
liberalisation and the introduction of discount pricing in May. Strikes
which inconvenience the public and cause economic loss are likely to come
under scrutiny by the new right-wing government pledged to greater
liberalisation.
