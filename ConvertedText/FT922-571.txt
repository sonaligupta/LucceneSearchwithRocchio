FT  26 JUN 92 / Observer: Outside chance


If Halifax - 'the biggest and getting bigger' building society - really
means to break with its past and look beyond its own ranks for its next
chief executive, there'll certainly be no shortage of candidates.
The upper echelons of NatWest and Midland are littered with executives who
have been passed over for promotion, and so would relish a go at running a
retail banking business which is over twice as big as the TSB.
Even so, the last thing the Halifax needs is a dull and boring clearing
banker running the works. Apart from Lloyds Bank's Brian Pitman, very few of
same can pass muster as good at both banking and managing. Far better to
emulate Abbey National by recruiting a complete newcomer, as it did in Peter
Birch, a former managing director of the UK end of Gillette.
Whether the Halifax will actually do so is another question. It hates its
reputation for watching what Abbey does, then following suit after a decent
interval.
