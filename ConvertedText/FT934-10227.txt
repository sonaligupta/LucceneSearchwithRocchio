FT  06 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Third quarter fall at Sea Containers


NET earnings of Sea Containers fell from Dollars 23.3m to Dollars 15.9m in
the third quarter of 1993 leaving the nine months total to September 30
lower at Dollars 33.7m (Pounds 22.3m), compared with Dollars 36.9m.
Earnings per share dropped from Dollars 1.92 to Dollars 1.17 in the quarter
making Dollars 2.15 (Dollars 2.47) for nine months. Revenues totalled
Dollars 315.9m (Dollars 334.4m), but are not directly comparable because of
the sale of a manufacturing facility in January 1993 and translation of
sterling revenues at a lower exchange rate.
Mr James Sherwood, chairman, said ferry and port earnings for the third
quarter were down Dollars 2.7m at Dollars 20.9m because of the sterling
devaluation. Had there been no devaluation, however, there would have been a
10 per cent increase.
