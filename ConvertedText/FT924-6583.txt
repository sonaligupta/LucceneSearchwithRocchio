FT  20 NOV 92 / International Company News: Third-quarter profit at
Lufthansa


   By DAVID WALLER


   FRANKFURT


LUFTHANSA, the struggling German airline, yesterday reported a profit for
the third quarter but warned that it would revert to losses in the final
three months of 1992.
The company said that in September it made its first monthly profit this
year, and that total pre-tax losses for the first nine months were DM262m
(Dollars 164m), down from a first-half loss of DM542m, meaning that it made
a profit of DM280m in the third quarter.
The improvement was less due to business fundamentals than to the effects of
an accounting change, the company said. In September the airline announced
that it would switch to a less conservative depreciation policy for its
aircraft and it said yesterday that this was the main reason for the better
result.
The airline said that it achieved a significant increase in passengers
carried and a further reduction in the rate of cost increases during the
third quarter. Sales for the nine months rose 4.7 per cent to around DM11bn
while the number of passengers climbed sharply, by 14 per cent to 20.8m.
However, it warned that conditions in the industry continued to be bad, with
prices under pressure because of intense competition. Another negative
factor was the appreciation of the D-Mark which hit profits by DM254m in the
nine months and by DM142m in the third quarter alone.
Lufthansa said that the figures gave no reason to relax the current campaign
to cut costs in all areas of the business and that it was too early to say
that the company had turned the profits corner. For seasonal reasons, the
fourth quarter usually brought a loss, the company warned.
