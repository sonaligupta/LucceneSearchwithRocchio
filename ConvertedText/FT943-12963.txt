FT  22 JUL 94 / S Korea shipyard violence


   By REUTER


   SEOUL


Striking shipyard workers scuffled with security guards yesterday as a
dispute at South Korea's largest shipbuilder, Hyundai Heavy Industries,
boiled over into violence, Reuter reports from Seoul.
Witnesses said 3,000 workers and security guards tussled near the main gate
of Hyundai Heavy's shipyard as the strikers tried to break barricades to
enter the yard in the southeastern city of Ulsan.
There were injuries on both sides, the witnesses said.
The government is expected to invoke emergency powers to settle the labour
dispute over wages and a demand for a say in management of the company, a
unit of the mammoth Hyundai Group, a labour ministry official said. The
strike has lost the company Dollars 211m in sales.
