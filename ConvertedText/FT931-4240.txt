FT  11 MAR 93 / International Company News: Paramount suffers sharp fall to
Dollars 1m


   By ALAN FRIEDMAN


   NEW YORK


LOWER operating earnings from its entertainment division and seasonal losses
in publishing caused a sharp decline in net profits at Paramount
Communications during the first quarter of fiscal 1993 ended January 31.
The company had first- quarter net income of less than Dollars 1m, or 1 cent
per share, compared with Dollars 18.4m, or 16 cents in the first three
months of fiscal 1992.
Paramount's revenues also declined, to Dollars 943.7m in the quarter from
Dollars 1.07bn a year earlier.
Paramount said the weak performance of film releases in the quarter resulted
in lower operating income, despite higher contributions from television
programming operations.
Entertainment results in the first quarter also reflected lower operating
income from television broadcast stations and theatrical exhibition
operations, as well as a decline in earnings at Madison Square Garden in New
York.
Paramount also said its theme parks division, acquired in the fourth quarter
of fiscal 1992, suffered a small loss in the latest reporting period.
Publishing losses in the quarter were about equal to the corresponding
period last year.
Looking ahead, Paramount said it expected earnings momentum to build in the
second half of the year, led by strength in education and consumer
publishing and a recovery on the entertainment side.
On Wall Street, Paramount's share price was Dollars  1/4 higher at Dollars
50.
