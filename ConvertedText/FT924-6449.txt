FT  21 NOV 92 / Midlands report glimmer of recovery in economy


   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent


GLIMMERS OF economic recovery have appeared in the Midlands, according to
the regional councils of the Confederation of British Industry.
The east Midlands council reports that delayed investment plans are being
reconsidered and the west Midlands council has found an increase in export
orders.
In their first meetings since the Autumn Statement, both councils were more
cheerful about the immediate economic prospects than at any time for the
past six months.
Mr Bob Little, chairman of the east Midlands CBI, said: 'One is seeing the
government start to have an economic policy.' Mr Bryan Townsend, chairman of
the West Midlands CBI, said: 'There is cautious optimism - nobody wants to
get too optimistic because it's all gone sour before.'
Mentioning particularly the leisure, heating appliance and water-associated
industries, Mr Little said, 'There is evidence of the pulling forward of
investment plans.' But, for east Midlands companies, there appeared to be
little evidence of growing order books.
By contrast, in the west Midlands there had been an increase in export
orders over the last two to three weeks, Mr Townsend said. The increase had
been foreshadowed in the recent CBI-BSL regional trend survey, which noted
that much of any immediate increased export demand could be met from
accumulated stocks.
There has been no such increase in orders from the home market. 'I wouldn't
expect that all of a sudden things would turn round,' Mr Townsend said. But
Mr Little implied that the best prospects on the domestic market were in the
north of the UK.
