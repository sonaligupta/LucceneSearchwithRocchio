FT  12 MAR 92 / US plans big missile sale to Kuwait


   By REUTER


   WASHINGTON


THE Bush administration intends to sell to Kuwait Dollars 2.5bn worth of
Patriot and Hawk anti-aircraft missiles and related equipment, the US
Defence Department said yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington.
Patriots were used to shoot down Iraqi Scud missiles fired at Saudi Arabia
and Israel in the Gulf war. The Pentagon said the Patriots and Hawks would
help make up for a military deficiency in Kuwait caused by the war.
It said Congress had been notified of the plan to sell the missiles, made by
Raytheon Corporation, to the small Gulf emirate. Congress has 30 days in
which to allow the sale or reject it.
The White House last December announced plans to sell 14 Patriot batteries
and 758 missiles to the Saudis for Dollars 3.3bn.
