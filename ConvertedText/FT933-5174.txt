FT  04 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: Nikkei hits year's high - At a
Glance


The Nikkei stock index closed up four days out of five this week, and hit a
new high for the year on Friday. Other markets in the region are hitting
all-time highs, but Tokyo's closing high of 21,116 yesterday is still a very
long way off the all-time high of nearly 39,000 in late 1989. The Nikkei's
most recent low point of about 14,300 was reached in August 1992.
The Tokyo market's sentiment was buoyant this week on expectations of a cut
in the official discount rate, which has so far failed to materialise, but
investors still hope for an easing of monetary policy with the release of a
Bank of Japan report on business sentiment next week.
