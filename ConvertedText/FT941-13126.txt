FT  27 JAN 94 / MPs urge BT profits curb


   By ALAN CANE


MPs have urged Oftel, the telecommunications watchdog, to ensure that BT's
rate of return on capital employed remains 'within acceptable levels'.
In its first examination of a utility regulator, the Commons public accounts
committee says that Oftel should compare the UK's dominant
telecommunications operators with the leading US telephone companies as a
basis for assessing BT's performance.
It adds: 'As improved efficiency has a bearing on charges, we recommend that
such information is made available to customers in order that they may judge
the position for themselves.'
Oftel told the committee that BT's service had improved and that its
efficiency came close to the best of the US telephone companies. Oftel had
set an acceptable level of return on capital for BT of between 17.5 per cent
and 19 per cent. But in the years 1987-92, Oftel agreed that BT had made
Pounds 1.6bn more in profits than the benchmark dictated.
BT yesterday denied that its profits were unacceptable. Its pricing formula
 -the retail prices index minus 7.5 percentage points - was universally
recognised as tough, it said.
The committee also warns that the '999' emergency service should not suffer
from the increase in the number of operators licensed to offer telecoms
services.
BT said the committee's investigation had been completed last May. Its
conclusions were based largely on opinion rather than fact and many of the
recommendations had already been implemented.
