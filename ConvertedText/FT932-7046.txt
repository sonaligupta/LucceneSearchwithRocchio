FT  26 MAY 93 / No charges over N Sea crash


SHELL, the oil company, will not be prosecuted over the deaths of 11 men in
a North Sea helicopter crash, the Crown Office has confirmed.
Pilot error was blamed for the tragedy in March last year when a Super Puma
helicopter plunged into the sea on a two-minute flight from Shell's
Cormorant Alpha platform. But, after a fatal accident inquiry in Aberdeen,
Sheriff Alexander Jessop found that Shell had contributed to the loss of
life.
The Crown Office confirmed that nobody would be prosecuted because 'it would
not be in the public's interest'.
