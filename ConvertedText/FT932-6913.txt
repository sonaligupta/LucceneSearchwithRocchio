FT  26 MAY 93 / International Company News: Court gives approval to E-II
reorganisation plan


   By NIKKI TAIT


THE tussle over E-II Holdings, the bankrupt parent company which owns
Samsonite luggage, Culligan water treatment and McGregor menswear, ended in
the early hours of yesterday morning with a Manhattan bankruptcy court judge
approving the company's amended reorganisation plan.
E-II, which has had a complex history over the past five years, became the
centre of a struggle between two leading creditors - Mr Leon Black, formerly
a senior banker with Drexel Burnham Lambert, and Mr Carl Icahn, former owner
of Trans World Airlines and a corporate raider in the 1980s.
Mr Icahn opposed the reorganisation plan, arguing that it gave control of
the ongoing company to Mr Black at too cheap a price.
At the last minute, Mr Icahn offered to buy E-II for Dollars 1.18bn in cash,
and when that proposal was turned down, made (or arranged) offers for the
separate operating business-es.
Meanwhile, E-II and its advisers, having dismissed Mr Icahn's initial offer
last Friday, made last-minute amendments to its plan of reorganisation,
revising upwards their estimates of the company's value  - and thus
countering some of Mr Icahn's criticism.
