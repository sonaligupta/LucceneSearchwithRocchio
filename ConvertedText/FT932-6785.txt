FT  27 MAY 93 / Japan to seek links with China


   By ROBERT THOMSON

THE Japanese government is to propose to China that the two countries resume
bilateral security negotiations, frozen after the crushing of the Chinese
democracy movement four years ago.
Japanese officials will raise the sensitive issue during a visit by Mr Qian
Qichen, the Chinese foreign minister, due in Tokyo this Saturday, in the
hope of drawing Beijing into regional security discussions amid raising
concerns about the expanding capability of the People's Liberation Army.
The Japanese Foreign Ministry is divided over how to handle China's
increasingly sophisticated military technology, which some officials fear is
changing the balance of power in the region and creating a potential
long-term threat.
But the Chinese government does not welcome outside advice on the conduct of
its military affairs, and the Japanese government would like Beijing to
participate in broader discussions on regional security, which could include
China's capability.
Japan would also raise issues such as North Korea's military intentions and
its pullout from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, as well as the
changing role of Russia in the region and the future of Cambodia.
Links were cut in 1989 in protest at the PLA's role in the crushing of the
Chinese democracy movement, but Tokyo has become anxious to restart
discussions and believes Mr Qian's visit provides an appropriate
opportunity.
Mr Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, a faction head of the ruling Liberal Democratic party,
has expressed concern about the modernisation of China's military,
highlighted by a planned 14.9 per cent increase in spending for fiscal 1993,
but the Japanese government, generally, has been timid on the issue.
