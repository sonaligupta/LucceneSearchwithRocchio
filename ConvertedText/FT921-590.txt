FT  28 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Breedon declines by 40%


BREEDON, the Derbyshire-based limestone quarrying and housebuilding group,
suffered a 40 per cent contraction in pre-tax profits in the 12 months to
January 31, a 'difficult year' when supply was in excess of demand and
profit margins were squeezed.
However, the directors have recommended maintaining the final dividend at
2.85p for an unchanged total of 4.6p.
Turnover shrank by almost 32 per cent to Pounds 9.49m (Pounds 13.9m) and
operating profits were reduced to Pounds 1.9m (Pounds 3.72m). Other income
edged ahead to Pounds 722,000 (Pounds 626,000) but gains from the sale of
non-trading assets fell to Pounds 146,000 (Pounds 241,000).
Attributable profits declined by a little more than Pounds 1m to Pounds
1.95m and earnings worked through at 6.85p (10.68p) per share.
The company said that it remained in a sound financial position and had no
borrowings.
