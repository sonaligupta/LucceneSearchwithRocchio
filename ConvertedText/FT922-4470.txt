FT  05 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Marston deal with Courage


   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE


MARSTON, Thompson & Evershed, the Burton-on-Trent-based brewer, yesterday
announced a reciprocal beer distribution agreement with Courage, its fifth
such alliance in the past month, writes Philip Rawstorne.
From mid-July, Marston will add a range of Courage lagers and Beamish Irish
stout to its range. It will also distribute the leading Courage ale, John
Smith's Bitter, in the Midlands and north-west. Courage will add Pedigree
premium cask-conditioned ale and Low C, the lower calorie bottled beer, to
its portfolio.
Marston, in which the Whitbread Investment Company has yet to reduce its
31.4 per cent shareholding to comply with the government beer orders, has
already signed similar deals with Wolverhampton & Dudley, Scottish &
Newcastle, Allied, and Bass.
