FT  08 NOV 94 / Target for M0 'not useful'


The government's target for M0 - the narrow gauge of money supply - serves
'no useful purpose' and should be scrapped, Mr Tim Congdon, one of the
Treasury's independent advisers, says in the November edition of Gerrard &
National's Economic Review.
Annual growth of M0 has been above the government's target of 0 per cent 4
per cent since January last year.
Mr Congdon says that if the Bank of England's claim that M0 has been a 'good
leading indicator of retail inflation in the past' was correct, its
above-target growth ought to have had a significant impact on inflation.
