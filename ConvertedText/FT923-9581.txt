FT  04 AUG 92 / Ruling party claims wins in Mexican state polls


   By REUTER


   MEXICO CITY


CANDIDATES of Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI)
claimed victory yesterday in elections for five state governorships, held on
Sunday, but opposition parties in two states were objecting strongly, Reuter
reports from Mexico City.
The PRI runners said initial returns put them well ahead in the central
states of Zacatecas and Aguascalientes, the eastern state of Veracruz and
the southern state of Oaxaca.
The party also said it was far ahead in the northern state of Durango.
However, it faced a strong challenge there from Mr Rodolfo Elizondo,
candidate of a combined opposition, who claimed a narrow lead over the PRI's
Mr Maximiliano Silerio.
In Veracruz, Mr Heberto Castillo, running for the opposition PRD, accused
the ruling party of fraud, including ballot box theft, illegal campaigning
on polling day and violence against PRD representatives.
