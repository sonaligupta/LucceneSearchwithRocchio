FT  13 MAR 93 / Fulham FC in GMB strip


   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor


THE GMB general union yesterday agreed a sponsorship deal with Fulham
Football Club. In exchange for a little less than Pounds 10,000, the players
at the Division II west London club will wear the GMB logo on their shirts
for the last 12 games of the season, of which three will be televised, and
the union will be able to use the club's hospitality box for negotiations.
Fulham has had mixed fortunes. The England star Johnny Haynes, the first
Pounds 100-a-week footballer, helped to keep the club at the top in the
1950s and 1960s but it later became better known as a pre-retirement stop
for players such as George Best, Bobby Moore, and Rodney Marsh. It is now
mid-table in the second division and has just secured its future with a
lease arrangement for its ground.
The union is backing Fulham partly because it is cheap and partly because
the club is inoffensive enough not to arouse hostile feel-ings in the GMB's
football-following members. The idea came from the local Hammersmith branch
 -the union claims more than 4,000 members in the borough of Hammersmith and
Fulham.
Mr Paul Kenny, the union's London secretary, hopes the deal will show that
'modern trade unions are an important pillar of the community'.
The GMB has a long history of involvement with sport. Mr Tom Burlison, its
deputy general secretary, is a former professional footballer, and the union
provides advice to several sports associations.
