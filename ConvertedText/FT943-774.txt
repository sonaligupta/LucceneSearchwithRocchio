FT  28 SEP 94 / League wins RAI channel


   By ROBERT GRAHAM


   ROME


Italy's populist Northern League has been promised control of the third
channel of the RAI, the state broadcasting organisation, in a deal struck
between the main partners in the right-wing coalition government. This
represents a big concession to the League, which has long been campaigning
for greater regionalisation of the RAI and in particular for the right to
run a station out of Milan. The compromise follows a threat by the League to
undo the government's appointments to the board and editorial management of
the RAI. The editorial appointments were announced last week and involve a
complete change in the existing controllers in favour of people considered
sympathetic to the Berlusconi government. However, the League complained the
choice was too narrow.
