FT  15 JUN 93 / International Company News: Steyr chief expects Sch100m
shortfall


   By REUTER


   VIENNA


STEYR-Daimler-Puch Machinery, the Austrian arms and vehicle maker, is
expected to make an operating loss of at least Sch100m in 1993, chief
executive Mr Rudolf Streicher told the company's annual meeting, Reuter
reports from Vienna.
'We expect a triple-digit loss (in millions of schillings),' Mr Streicher
said. Only two of the 13 companies Steyr controls - Steyr Mannlicher and
Steyr-Daimler-Puch Spezialfahrzeug - had delivered a positive result so far
this year, he added.
He declined to give full details of first-half performance ahead of the
presentation of final half-year results in July.
Steyr is 71 per cent owned by Creditanstalt-Bankverein.
However, Mr Streicher said that Steyr, which had a 1992 net profit of
Sch17.5m (Dollars 1.53m) in figures which were consolidated for the first
time, had suffered a further turnover loss so far this year.
Group turnover was down in the first four months by 30 per cent at Sch3.9bn
against a year earlier.
Only the Eurostar minivan joint venture, being operated with Chrysler Corp
of the US was on target, with turnover running at Sch2.7bn during the first
five months.
Wholly-owned subsidiary Steyr-Daimler-Puch Fahrzeugtechnik has been worst
hit, with turnover down 56 per cent so far this year - in line with the fall
in turnover at the company in 1992.
