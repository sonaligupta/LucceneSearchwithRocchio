FT  01 DEC 94 / The Budget: Inefficient budget management leading to
deprivation for schools


Inefficient budget management is depriving schools of Pounds 800m each year
which should be spent on resources and employing extra teachers, a teachers'
union leader said yesterday.
Mr Nigel de Gruchy, NASUWT general secretary, said that in primary schools
7.33 per cent of funds delegated to them by local education authorities
remained unspent at the end of the year.
He claimed that local management of schools, which forces authorities to
delegate more funding decisions to schools, had 'forced every school to act
as its own insurance company', while some were guilty of the 'squirrel
mentality'.
He cited research by the Audit Commission, the local government watchdog,
which predicted that local management would lead to an overall increase in
costs.
Other teachers' unions said that Mr de Gruchy was exaggerating the problem.
Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head
Teachers, said Mr de Gruchy was 'playing into the hands of politicians by
giving the impression of large amounts of money being held back which ought
to be spent on pupils'.
The Department for Education indicated that no change in regulations on
school budgets was likely, although heads and governors should 'think
carefully' about the amount kept in balances.
