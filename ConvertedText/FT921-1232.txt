FT  25 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Liffe options trading hit by
teething difficulties


   By TRACY CORRIGAN


EQUITY options trading on the London International Financial Futures and
Options Exchange (Liffe) is undergoing some teething problems after last
weekend's merger of London's futures and options markets.
The merger involved a change of clearing and trading systems for equity
option traders from the London Traded Options Market (LTOM). The shift to
the new systems was described by one trader as 'smooth, considering the
number of adjustments which had to be made'.
The largest hiccup was that the notification to traders of the exercise of
FT-SE index options was not delivered in sufficient time on Monday evening
to ensure traders were aware of any changes to their positions. As a result,
the opening of trading in the index option contract was delayed for 15
minutes. The information should have been delivered by Liffe's Trade
Registration System (TRS), which option traders moved to as a result of the
merger. On LTOM, the system of notification was completed manually.
Liffe said the problem was not expected to recur.
The initial difficulties of adapting to new trading systems are expected to
be overcome shortly. But the future of the equity options market hangs in
the balance. Liffe is working on a business plan for the equity options
market. The success of the implementation of the plan may be the determining
factor.
