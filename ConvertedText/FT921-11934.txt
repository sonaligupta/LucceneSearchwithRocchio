FT  29 JAN 92 / Western Isles chief fuels poll tax dispute


   By JAMES BUXTON


WESTERN Isles Council, which lost Pounds 23m with the closure of Bank of
Credit and Commerce International, was in disarray yesterday after Mr Donald
Macleod, the convener (chairman), appeared to suggest that islanders should
not pay the poll tax which the council has increased by 370 per cent, James
Buxton writes.
Mr Macleod told BBC Radio yesterday that he had not favoured imposing the
losses from BCCI on poll-tax payers. Asked if he thought people ought to pay
the increased tax, he replied: 'I don't think so.'
Later he said he did not support non-payment and blamed his statement on
confusion caused by a bad telephone line.
Mr Angus Graham, another councillor, said Mr Macleod should resign because
of his statements. He said: 'He doesn't know what he's saying. I just think
that the best thing that could happen now would be for Councillor Macleod to
step down.'
The council voted on Monday to raise its poll tax from Pounds 26 to Pounds
122. Of that, Pounds 35 is to cover the cost of extra borrowing to replace
the BCCI loss.
