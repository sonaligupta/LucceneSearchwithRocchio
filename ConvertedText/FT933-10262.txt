FT  05 AUG 93 / Real cost of childcare rises steeply


   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor


MOTHERS spend four and a half times more on childcare in real terms than
they did 11 years ago, says a survey of 9,000 parents published in the
latest issue of Employment Gazette.
The increase in spending includes 'a large increase in the real cost of
childcare'.
State provision of childcare in Britain is negligible and most of it is
still provided by relatives and friends. However, nearly one-in-four working
mothers now pays for childcare and spends on average Pounds 30.70 a week on
it - a quarter of her earnings, the survey says.
In 1980 only 16 per cent of working mothers were paying for childcare.
Thirty-nine per cent of women with dependent children now work full-time and
the overall workforce participation rate of women in this category has
increased from 49 per cent to 63 per cent over the past two decades.
Nannies are the most costly form of childcare at an average of Pounds 72 a
week.
Only about a third of nannies receive more than Pounds 100 a week, according
to the survey. However, it does not diff-erentiate between live-in nannies
and those who live out.
Parents who use a 'nursery or creche' pay Pounds 39 a week, on average, and
'nursery schools and playgroups' cost an average Pounds 34 a week.
The proportion of earnings spent on childcare is highest for the
least-well-paid and for part-time workers. Payments for childcare rise as
hours of work and earnings increase, but only a minority - the best-paid
women - spend more than Pounds 40 a week on childcare.
Thirty-eight per cent of those paying for childcare spend less than Pounds
20 a week and 61 per cent less than Pounds 40.
Lone parents have a greater reliance on childcare. Among lone parents with
jobs, 29 per cent pay for childcare - at an average cost of Pounds 24.60 a
week.
Of those who pay anything for childcare, only 19 per cent of lone parents
and a third of couples spend more than Pounds 40 a week and only about one
in 10 of all working mothers spend more than Pounds 60 a week.
The average household's expenditure rose by nearly Pounds 15 a week last
year, according to the government's Family Expenditure Survey. Average
weekly expenditure in 1992 was Pounds 271.80 compared with Pounds 256.90 in
1991. The average gross household income was Pounds 342.90 per week compared
with Pounds 338.20 a year earlier.
