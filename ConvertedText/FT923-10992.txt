FT  28 JUL 92 / Indian premier gives pledge on Ayodhya site


   By SHIRAZ SIDHVAR


   NEW DELHI


MR Narasimha Rao, the Indian prime minister, assured parliament yesterday
that the 16th century Babri mosque in the northern city of Ayodhya would not
be demolished to make way for a Hindu temple.
The dispute over the future of the mosque has caused communal tension
between Hindus and Moslems including rioting in two Indian states last week.
Hindu militants agreed over the weekend to follow a court order stopping
construction at the disputed site.
They also agreed to wait for the Indian courts to decide on the dispute. Mr
Rao said the government was willing to consolidate all the cases pending in
different Indian courts under 'one judicial authority' for a speedy verdict
on the temple issue. He also suggested the all-party talks resume to solve
the temple dispute amicably.
Supporters of the Hindu Parishad (VHP) and the Bajrang Dal, both militant
affiliates of the Hindu right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), have
reluctantly agreed to shift their attention for now to another temple at a
site nearby in Ayodhya.
