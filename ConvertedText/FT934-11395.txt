FT  01 NOV 93 / Arts: Today's Television


   By ANTONY THORNCROFT


Victor Lewis-Smith is a card. His anarchic humour, slanderous, blasphemous,
scatological, used to pop up on the more broad-minded radio programmes, such
as Ned Sherrin's Loose Ends.
Somehow he has survived and tonight he gets his own TV series Inside Victor
Lewis-Smith (BBC2, 10.00). Invariably television tames the wildest spirits,
but Lewis-Smith has been over-dosing on outrage for so long he is probably
incurable.
The repeat of House of Cards (BBC1, 10.10) confirms how accurate Michael
Dobb's far-fetched saga of parliamentary intrigue and the overthrow of a PM
really was. Somehow the surreal goldfish bowl filming technique draws you
in. How they dared get so close to the truth in portraying the criminal
habits of some of the thinly disguised characters is breathtaking.
Anyone impressed that for the first time the Booker judges have awarded
their prize to a popular, funny, novel in Roddy Doyle's 'Paddy Clarke
Ha-Ha-Ha' but who still cannot be bothered to read the book can have it read
to them in Booker 1993 (BBC2, 12.00).
