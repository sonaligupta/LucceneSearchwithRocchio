FT  08 NOV 93 / People: Boulton & Paul


Sir Derek Alun-Jones, who was chairman and chief executive of Ferranti
International from 1975 to 1989, has been appointed to the new post of
non-executive chairman at Boulton & Paul, the leading UK joinery
manufacturer.
The appointment, which takes effect immediately, is a coup for Boulton &
Paul, which was purchased from BET in February in a Pounds 14.5m management
buy-out.
David Chenery, Boulton & Paul's chief executive, said: 'We know our
customers pretty well but what we wanted was to add another dimension.
Working with Sir Derek, we can capitalise on the progress we have made to
date and prepare for a possible flotation of the business three to four
years hence.'
