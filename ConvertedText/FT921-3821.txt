FT  12 MAR 92 / Far-right poll challenge for Kohl


   By QUENTIN PEEL

CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl's ruling Christian Democrats (CDU) are in danger of
losing their absolute majority in Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany's richest
federal state, and of allowing right-wing extremists to gain a foothold in
the state parliament.
The latest opinion poll, published less than four weeks before the state
election, shows support for the CDU, which has ruled Baden-Wurttemberg
unchallenged since 1972, slipping to 44 per cent. At the same time, the
extreme right Republican Party is backed by 4.9 per cent, only a fraction
short of the 5 per cent mark needed to gain seats in the regional
parliament.
Total support for the extreme right stands at 8 per cent, including the
National Democrats (NPD) and the German League, according to the poll
carried out by the respected Allensbach Institute for the Frankfurter
Allgemeine and SAT-1 TV. The figures suggest a drift by voters away from the
mainstream parties. Mr Kohl and his CDU colleagues have raised the issue of
controlling the influx of asylum-seekers as a campaign theme to prevent
erosion of their vote to the far right.
