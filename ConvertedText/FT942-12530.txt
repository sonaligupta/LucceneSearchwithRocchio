FT  29 APR 94 / Council tax 'successfully implemented'


The council tax has been successfully implemented, but local government
reorganisation could yet make it as unpopular as the domestic rates, the
Joseph Rowntree Foundation says today.
According to a report by the social research organisation, replacing English
county and Scottish regional councils with smaller unitary authorities would
mean changes in the distribution of government grants and business rates.
These account for between Pounds 80 and Pounds 90 of every Pounds 100 spent
by councils.
Mr Tony Travers, a co-author of the report and director of the Greater
London group at the London School of Economics, said: 'Since local tax now
raises a comparatively small proportion of total revenue, any loss of
central resources could produce a disproportionately large rise in council
tax.' But the tax was broadly seen as fair, he added.
