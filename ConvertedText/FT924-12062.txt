FT  22 OCT 92 / International Company News: Minorco to buy Chevron copper
interest in Chile


   By PHILIP GAWITH


MINORCO, the Luxembourg-based resources associate of South African mining
group Anglo American, has agreed to buy one-third of a Chilean copper
project for Dollars 185m from a subsidiary of Chevron, the US oil group.
Under the deal, Minorco acquires Chevron Exploration Corporation of Chile's
interest in the Collabuasi copper project.
Minorco will assign the interest to a new company to be 50.1 per cent owned
by Minorco and 49.9 per cent by Empresa Minera de Mantos Blancos, a Chilean
company, which is 74 per cent owned by Anglo American.
The new company will be called Minera Mantos Minorco and will be listed on
the Santiago stock exchange.
The deal is subject to Falconbridge and Royal Dutch/Shell, CECC's partners
in the project, not exercising their rights to acquire the interest.
Four separate copper deposits have been identified within the Collabuasi
area. A pre-feasibility study, commissioned by the joint venture partners,
should be completed in the second quarter of 1993.
Minorco believes the project's start-up date will be 1996-7. Initial
indications show ore reserves of about 1.1bn to 1.2bn tonnes with a grade of
more than 1 per cent copper.
Collabuasi is located in northern Chile, about 30km west of the Chilian
border with Bolivia.
Chevron, which is believed to have paid about Dollars 45m for its original
investment, is said to be divesting all of its non-petroleum interests.
