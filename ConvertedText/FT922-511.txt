FT  27 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Marling Pounds 11.9m in loss and calls for
Pounds 18m


   By PETER PEARSE


MARLING Industries reported yesterday a plunge from pre-tax profits of
Pounds 3.6m to losses of Pounds 11.9m in the year to March 31, withheld its
final dividend, launched an Pounds 18m rights issue and announced sweeping
changes to its businesses and board.
The group, whose shares closed down 10p at 23p, intends to revert to its
core of industrial and seat webbing and rigid, narrow industrial fabrics. It
is selling Boalloy, the commercial vehicle body maker to its management.
Mr David Abel Smith, chief executive since January, said Boalloy had been a
drain on the group for 18 months because of the slump in vehicle sales. In
the past year, it made operating losses of Pounds 3.6m. Operating losses for
the group totalled Pounds 3.36m. Boalloy is to be sold for Pounds 1 plus the
assumption of Pounds 3.4m of bank debt.
Marling has also stopped funding Airbags, a maker of airbags for automotive
safety systems, and is negotiating to dispose of its 50 per cent interest
with Electrolux Autoliv, its joint venture partner.
Mr Peter Held, its 69-year-old founder and chairman, said yesterday he would
retire before the annual meeting in September. A non-executive chairman was
being sought.
The cash call will raise about Pounds 18m net via the issue of 128.7m new
ordinary 5p shares at 15p each on the basis of four for each 10p share held.
It will fund the redeeming of the convertible preference shares. Some Pounds
4.7m of the issue will go for cash redemption of the preference, Pounds
250,000 goes into the rights and Pounds 720,000 is being waived by the
preference holders, resulting in saving of about Pounds 1m.
Group turnover fell to Pounds 102.7m (Pounds 121.8m). Interest payable of
Pounds 3.6m (Pounds 3.66m) and exceptional charges of Pounds 4.9m (credit
Pounds 531,000) hit the pre-tax line, below which extraordinary costs of
Pounds 18.6m, relating to losses on the disposal of Boalloy and others, led
to retained losses for the year of Pounds 31.5m (Pounds 335,000) and losses
per share of 41.27p.
It has paid an interim dividend of 0.3p. The total last time was 4.2p paid
out of earnings per share of 4.84p.
