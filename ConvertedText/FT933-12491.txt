FT  23 JUL 93 / International Company News: Vietnamese fund raises more than
expected


   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor


THE PROSPECT of rapid development in Vietnam has prompted European
investment institutions to commit Dollars 44.6m to the Vietnam Fund, more
than double the amount it had been hoping to raise this year.
The offering, which closed yesterday, was the second by the Dublin-listed
fund, which is the only quoted vehicle for investment in Vietnam. The
response was in marked contrast to the initial offering in 1991, when it
managed to raise only Dollars 10m after seeking Dollars 30m.
Mr Martin Adams, managing director, said this year's plan had been to raise
Dollars 20m in Europe, and a further Dollars 2m later in the US, provided
that President Clinton lifted the American embargo on dealings with Hanoi.
However, the success of the issue in Europe means the fund now has no plans
to raise further capital.
The Vietnam Fund, which takes significant minority stakes in projects
producing hard currency or with foreign involvement, has committed its
existing cash to agricultural and real estate projects.
The new offering of shares, at 13.9 per cent above the net asset value of
Dollars 9.88, is partly paid, providing about Dollars 19m of cash now and
the remainder of the Dollars 44.6m after a year.
Mr Adams said a dozen projects were expected to be considered by the fund's
investment committee in the next six months.
Though Vietnam has long been thought to offer huge promise, the US embargo
has severely hampered the country's development, despite the government's
programme of market-oriented economic reforms.
However, President Clinton announced this month that he would remove a US
block on Vietnam repaying its arrears to the International Monetary Fund,
clearing the way for the IMF, World Bank and Asian Development Bank to
resume lending.
