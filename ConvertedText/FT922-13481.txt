Investments are spread over 12 countries of the Pacific region. Only in Hong
Kong did the trust fail to outperform the local indices.

at the year-end.
Geographically, the largest holdings in the fund are Japan 42.4 per cent,
North America 21.8 per cent, and Australia/New Zealand 15 per cent.
Total revenue in the year was Pounds 6.44m (Pounds 6.39m).
The attributable balance fell to Pounds 2.08m (Pounds 2.73m) as there was a
substantial increase in interest payments on the borrowings to fund the move
into bonds.
