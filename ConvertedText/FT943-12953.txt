FT  22 JUL 94 / Nigeria seeks strike deal


   By PAUL ADAMS


   LAGOS


Nigeria's military government appears ready to seek a compromise on the
industrial and wage demands of striking oil workers if they drop their
political demands and return to work.
In a meeting in Lagos scheduled for today, Mr Umaru Baba, the junior oil
minister, will meet representatives of both the main unions and the
operating companies.
There were signs at a meeting with the government and employers on Wednesday
that the junior workers' union, Nupeng, was willing to end the strike in
return for settlement of two pay disputes with employers, information on the
whereabouts of their general secretary Mr Frank Kokori, and assurances that
the government will restore oil industry investment and move quickly towards
democracy.
Nupeng provisionally agreed to pay offers on Wednesday. The union, whose
members have received no pay since the two-week strike began, appeared to
soften their stance and said they would consider returning to work if the
oil companies attended today's meeting and confirmed that the government was
increasing investment.
The senior staff association, Pengassan, said yesterday it would attend the
meeting if invited but would not compromise on either its political or
economic demands.
The strikers are demanding that the military leave government and make way
for Mr Moshood Abiola - widely regarded as the winner of last year's
annulled presidential election - who is in prison facing treason charges for
declaring himself president last month.
