FT  02 NOV 93 / International Company News: Produce replaces payouts in
Japan


   By EMIKO TERAZONO

FORCED to cut dividends as earnings are hit by the economic slowdown,
Japanese companies are starting to compensate shareholders with produce.
With most companies expecting an earnings decline for the fourth successive
year, more shareholders are being deprived of dividends.
Comson, a farming machinery maker listed on the Osaka stock exchange, says
that instead of dividends it sent its 1,900 shareholders bags of fertiliser
made from manure and sludge, while Nippon Pulp and Paper gave 24 rolls of
toilet paper to every stockholder.
Workers are already sacrificing bonuses to help their employers. NEC
managers last year accepted vouchers that can be swapped for computers and
television sets instead of year-end payments.
Some companies hope the gifts will help restore confidence, especially among
retail investors disheartened by stock market scandals and last year's
plunge of the Nikkei average to a six-year low.
The government had hoped that the flotation of East Japan Railway (JR East),
the partially privatised regional railway operator, would bring retail
investors back into the stock market. However, profit-taking in JR East
shares clogged the Tokyo stock exchange's computers, sending the market
below 20,000 for the first time in three months.
Since Japan's traditionally low payout levels have never been much of an
incentive for investors - the current average yield for the Tokyo market is
about 0.7 per cent - companies also hope to lure investors with products. In
the late 1980s, holders of Tokyo Electric Power shares were presented with
electric kettles.
Amid anxiety surrounding a shortage of rice due to this year's bad summer,
Shinden, an electric appliance discounter based in Niigata, is sending
shareholders bags of premium brand rice.
