FT  19 APR 91 / De Klerk initiative to end violence

   JOHANNESBURG


THE South African government is to set up a permanent commission of inquiry
into the violence which has left more than 5,000 people dead in the past
four years, and will convene a two-day summit of political and other leaders
next month to seek a formula for peace.
The moves were announced by President F W de Klerk on the eve of his
departure for a three-nation European tour and may go some way towards
meeting the demands of the African National Congress. The ANC has threatened
to boycott talks on a new constitution unless Pretoria takes further steps
to halt violence and prevent alleged involvement by the security forces.
Earlier this week, Mr Nelson Mandela, the ANC deputy president, rejected
planned multi-party talks on violence, but the announcement of a commission
of inquiry might persuade him to change his mind.
