FT  24 AUG 92 / Arts: International visual arts venture


THE Arts Council has spent the last few years desperately trying to shed
clients, so it is something of an event that it will this week announce a
brand new arts venture which will cost nearly Pounds 400,000 a year in
subsidy once it is up and running.
The Institute of New International Visual Arts, or INIVA, will be an arts
centre dedicated to promoting contemporary artists from Africa, the
Caribbean and Asia. As well as gallery space there will be education,
research and publishing facilities.
Already Pounds 277,000 has been committed, including Pounds 47,000 from the
London Arts Board, to develop the idea and to get the creative work underway
while the search goes on for the disused factory, or empty warehouse, or
even purpose built structure, which will be home to INIVA.
Originally Kings Cross was the favoured location but now the Arts Council is
talking to Lambeth, and Kensington and Chelsea Councils, both of which have
received City Challenge money from the Government. A local authority will
ideally supply the building while the Arts Council meets the running costs.
