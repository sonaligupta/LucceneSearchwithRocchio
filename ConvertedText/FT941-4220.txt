FT  12 MAR 94 / German union accepts 2%

Germany's largest public sector union accepted a pay rise below the rate of
inflation for its 3.5m members yesterday, improving prospects of a round of
low wage increases across the country.
The OTV union accepted a rise of 2 per cent, against inflation projected at
around 3 per cent this year. In addition, civil servants will give up the
traditional 13th month of extra pay at Christmas for the next three years.
The deal, which follows a series of token strikes, was reached after 40
hours of talks in Stuttgart between union negotiators and interior ministry
officials. Within hours of the OTV deal being announced, IG Metall -
Germany's largest union, representing 3.6m engineering workers - secured
agreement from its members for a below-inflation pay increase negotiated by
the leadership last week.
IG Metall workers in the state of Lower Saxony voted overwhelmingly to
accept the deal, which has already been agreed by almost all other union
regions, thus heading off threatened strikes in the engineering sector. The
deal is seen as the benchmark for remaining pay talks this year.
In the public sector agreement, civil servants in lower pay brackets, in
particular in eastern Germany, will receive their rise from July 1, while
middle-ranking and senior officials will be paid at the higher rate two
months later. The deal will run for 15 months starting January 1 1994.
The agreement was accepted overwhelmingly by the OTV union's 210-strong wage
commission, after being recommended by the negotiating team. It includes
greater flexibility for workers taking time off in lieu of overtime.
Meanwhile, IG Medien, the print union, said its members staged a second day
of warning strikes across the country. About 400,000 workers made token
stoppages at about 50 plants, the union said.
