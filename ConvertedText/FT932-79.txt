FT  30 JUN 93 / International Company News: Investor sells Asea shareholding


   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES


   STOCKHOLM


INVESTOR, the Wallenberg family's key holding company, is cutting debts by
nearly SKr3bn (Dollars 385m) through the sale of its entire shareholding in
Asea, the joint owner of the Asea Brown Boveri engineering combine.
A total of 6.96m shares, equal to 7.4 per cent of Asea's capital, have been
placed with around 130 international and domestic institutions at SKr422 per
share. The move raises SKr2.94bn for Investor and produces a SKr950m capital
gain.
The deal does not significantly weaken Investor's influence over Asea,
thanks to a related agreement involving Investor associate Incentive.
This involves reclassifying 6.1m of Incentive's Asea B shares which carry
one-tenth of a vote, to one-vote A shares, while a similar number of the
shares Investor is selling will switch from A to B status.
This will increase Incentive's voting stake in Asea to 32.9 per cent from 25
per cent, while only cutting Investor's overall voting influence from 35 per
cent to 32.9 per cent. Investor holds 25.9 per cent of the capital and 34.1
per cent of the votes in Incentive.
Investor said the sale was in line with its stated strategy of cutting net
debt, which at March 31 stood at SKr9.86bn.
The investment group has stakes in many of Sweden's blue-chip companies,
including Astra, the pharmaceuticals group; Stora, the forestry concern;
SKF, the roller bearing manufacturer; and Ericsson, the telecommunications
group. Although it also holds a 1.4 per cent stake in Skandinaviska Enskilda
Banken, the troubled Swedish bank, it said its decision to sell was not
directly linked to SE Banken's forthcoming share issue.
The placing was arranged by Morgan Stanley International and Enskilda
Corporate. The placing price was SKr30, or 6 per cent, below the SKr452
level at which Asea's shares closed on Monday, contributing to a SKr22 fall
in Asea's share price yesterday.
