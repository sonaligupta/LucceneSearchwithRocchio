FT  28 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Business rally - Ballot Box


Lord Weir, chairman of the engineering company Weir Group, yesterday
launched an organisation called Save the Union to fight against devolution
and independence for Scotland. He is among 20 leading Scots, including
several senior businessmen, who signed a letter in yesterday's Scotsman and
Herald newspapers. They have taken large advertisements in tomorrow's
Scottish Sunday papers.
Weir says that there has been so much propaganda 'of a biased and populist
kind' on the future of Scotland that objective discussion has been almost
impossible. Devolution would bring 'dangerous uncertainty to Scottish
industry and business'.
Other signatories include Alick Rankin, chairman of Scottish & Newcastle,
David Murray, chairman of Murray International and of Glasgow Rangers, Nick
McAndrew, chief executive of fund managers Murray Johnstone, Sir Ross Belch,
chairman of Ferguson Shipbuilders, and Sandy Struthers, chairman of
Caledonian MacBrayne.
Haven't they left it rather late? 'On the contrary,' says Lord Weir. 'The
whole issue isn't going to disappear with the election. We want to be a
rallying point for the future.'
