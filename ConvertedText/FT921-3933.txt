FT  12 MAR 92 / World Trade News: R-R in engine deal with Chinese airline


   By PAUL BETTS


ROLLS-ROYCE has made a breakthrough in the Chinese market for its Tay
engine, with an agreement to supply engines worth around Pounds 20m to China
Eastern Airlines, Paul Betts writes.
The Shanghai-based airline is buying seven Fokker 100 twin-engine regional
jets, to be powered by Rolls-Royce Tay 650 engines. The carrier is acquiring
its fleet of Rolls-Royce-powered Fokker 100s from a leasing company. The
first three Fokker 100s will be delivered in September and the remaining
four next year.
The aircraft and engines have already been been sold by the makers to the
leasing company, but Rolls-Royce said yesterday the agreement was important
because it was the first order for the Tay 650 and the Fokker 100 in China.
China Eastern operated Trident three-engine jets during the past 15 years
powered with Rolls-Royce Spey engines.
Western makers are interested in expanding their presence in the Chinese
market, where the potential has hardly been tapped. In the first six months
of last year China's airlines carried 8.8m international and domestic
passengers, a 33.5 per cent increase over the same period the previous year.
