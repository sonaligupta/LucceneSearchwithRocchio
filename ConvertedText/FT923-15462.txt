FT  02 JUL 92 / WPP finalises debt refinancing


   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent


WPP, the international marketing services group, has reached agreement to
swap a quarter of its Dollars 1bn (Pounds 540m) of bank debt for equity.
Agreements signed yesterday with its 28-bank syndicate of lenders provide
for 239.5m new convertible preference shares to be swapped for Dollars
271.6m of debt.
WPP announced on May 13 that it was seeking its second refinancing since
April 1991.
The agreement, signed in the early hours of yesterday morning, must now be
put to shareholders; they will receive a document outlining the proposals by
July 12.
A banker involved in the deal said yesterday that 'there was a bit of give
from the banks at the last moment', which allowed a slightly improved offer
for the holders of WPP's 213m convertible preference shares.
Under the terms agreed yesterday shareholders will be offered an improved
rate of five times existing conversion terms, against roughly four times.
There are also 60m ordinary shares issued. According to a banker speaking on
behalf of WPP, the signed agreement could mean banks eventually holding 48
per cent of the group.
As part of the agreement, and subject to shareholder approval of the
conversion of the existing convertible preference shares, the banks have
also agreed to extend the deadline of the repayment of a Dollars 400m loan
from June, 1993 to June, 1997, when a further Dollars 604m loan falls due.
The banks have also agreed to provide new facilities of up to Dollars 150m
for two years.
WPP is confident that the revised proposal will reduce resistance among
disgruntled convertible shareholders, who at the beginning of June appeared
to be preparing a united front against the original proposal.
Under the terms of the deal such shareholders still stand to relinquish some
Dollars 46m in accumulated unpaid dividends - WPP is unable to offer any
dividend payments at least until June 1993 - and their 78 per cent of voting
rights will become 32 per cent. WPP has consistently argued that it was not
prepared to negotiate on the conversion terms.
WPP reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 56m for 1991, down 38 per cent, on
revenues of Pounds 1.2bn; without exceptional items, pre-tax profits were
Pounds 38.36m.
