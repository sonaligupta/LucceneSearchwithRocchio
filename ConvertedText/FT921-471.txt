   MOSCOW


Azerbaijan yesterday denied it had agreed to tripartite peace talks with
Armenia and representatives from Nagorno-Karabakh, showing the two republics
to be as far apart as ever on the Transcaucasian enclave, writes Leyla
Boulton in Moscow.
But last night Mr Mahmud Vaezi, the Iranian deputy foreign minister, said
after a shuttle diplomacy mission that a meeting would be held early next
week with negotiators from Armenia, Azerbaijan, Iran and Russia.
