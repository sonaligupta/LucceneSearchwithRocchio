FT  04 AUG 92 / Blackpool to lose InterCity link


   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent


BRITISH Rail confirmed yesterday that Blackpool would lose its InterCity
links from Monday September 28 - the day the annual Labour party conference
is due to open there.
The line to the resort will in effect become a branch line, with passengers
leaving InterCity trains at Preston and changing to local services.
BR said it was no longer commercially viable to run InterCity services to
Blackpool because there were not enough passengers using the 17 1/2 -mile
stretch beyond Preston. The service was costly to run because diesel
locomotives had to be kept on hand to haul the trains on the short
non-electrified section between Preston and Blackpool.
The cutting of the Blackpool service is the latest in a series in the
InterCity network. Services to Shrewsbury, Shropshire, ceased in May, and
services to south Humberside are to end in September.
Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, said more cuts were possible.
He accused the government of cancelling peak services to clear a way for
private-sector trains run by companies such as Mr Richard Branson's Virgin
Group.
InterCity is also cutting two trains each way on weekdays from London to
Birmingham.
Mr John Hall, Blackpool's deputy director of tourism and attractions, said
the news had been 'greeted with very considerable dismay' in the resort.
'Our particular concern is over conference business,' he said. 'There is a
much higher percentage of delegates travelling by rail.' His department's
own survey had shown that, overall, only about 10 per cent of holidaymakers
arrived at the resort by train.
