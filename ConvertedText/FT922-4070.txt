FT  08 JUN 92 / Observer: Wigging


It seems that new Lord Chief Justice Lord Taylor has not yet convinced
everyone that judges are user-friendly and in tune with the times. A piece
of graffiti at Knightsbridge Crown Court reads: 'The Ice Age wiped out the
dinosaurs, but how did the judges survive?'
Of course, carbon-dating of the inscription may show it was written during
the tenure of Taylor's predecessor, Lord Lane.
