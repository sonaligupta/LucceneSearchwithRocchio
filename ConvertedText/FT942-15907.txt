FT  13 APR 94 / People: Guardian Royal Exchange


Donald Gordon, the South African entrepreneur, is loosening his ties with
Guardian Royal Exchange, the UK composite insurer with which he has been
associated for the past 30 years. He retires as a non-executive director
after the annual general meeting in May but will remain chairman of GRE's
South African subsidiary, Guardian National.
Gordon, who is GRE's second longest serving director after the chairman,
founded South Africa's Liberty Life in 1958. The British company provided
Gordon with financial backing to expand his South African business in his
early years and later established its own South African operation, Guardian
National.
Gordon will be 64 in June and GRE says that he has decided to curtail some
of his activities in order to 'concentrate on the strategic issues
pertaining to the Liberty Life group'.
