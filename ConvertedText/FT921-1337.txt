FT  25 MAR 92 / Saudis to pay 37% less for petrol


   By MARK NICHOLSON, Middle East Correspondent


SAUDI ARABIA, already one of the world's cheapest places to fill up a car,
has slashed domestic petrol prices by 37 per cent to 8.6 cents a litre.
The price cut is one of several on services and utilities made in a surprise
announcement by King Fahd, the Saudi ruler, to 'ease the burden of the cost
of living on the citizens'.
The move appears in part designed to soften the effects of inflation in the
kingdom since the Gulf war, which has risen substantially in the past year
in tandem with the general buoyancy of the economy.
However, the decision can also be seen as a concession to Islamic hardliners
in the kingdom, who have been increasingly critical of the ruling family
since the war and who believe that payment for essential services is an
unacceptable form of tax given the kingdom's vast oil wealth.
The price cuts certainly run counter to the government's general need to
reduce expenditure, given that it is already slated to run an Dollars 8bn
(Pounds 4.6bn) budget deficit for 1992 - its 10th successive budget
shortfall. 'From the purely financial standpoint, it makes little sense,'
said one Riyadh banker yesterday.
Mr Ali Hassan al-Shaer, the information minister, was quoted by SPA, the
Saudi press agency, as saying that the king had decreed price cuts including
a reduction of 30 per cent in domestic gas prices and a 28.5 per cent fall
in electricity prices. Water prices would also be halved.
Registration fees for businessmen and traders will be cut by up to 87 per
cent and cuts will also be made on port tariffs and exit visas.
