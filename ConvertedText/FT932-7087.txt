FT  26 MAY 93 / Danish bank chief says EMS 'collapsed'


   By REUTER


   COPENHAGEN


The European monetary system has, in effect, broken down by letting
countries win competitive advantage by devaluing currencies, said Mr Erik
Hoffmeyer, the Danish Central Bank chief, Reuter reports from Copenhagen.
'I have no reservations about saying that the currency co-operation has
collapsed in the past nine months,' he told a Danish business seminar.
Britain and Italy pulled their currencies out of the exchange rate mechanism
last autumn, and Ireland, Spain and Portugal have been forced to devalue
within the mechanism.
'We have seen a series of major devaluations which were completely out of
line with the reasonable pattern in a fixed exchange rate co-operation,' Mr
Hoffmeyer said.
He emphasised that the point of the EMS was to avoid competitive
devaluations. 'This has not been the case. What we have seen have been
irresponsible exchange-rate changes.'
Mr Hoffmeyer said market confidence in the EMS would not return until the
pound and lira had come back to the grid.
