FT  24 NOV 92 / Cocaine worth Pounds 160m seized in raid on ship


POLICE AND Customs seized the biggest single haul of cocaine in the UK in an
armed swoop as the drugs were being unloaded from an oil rig support ship
yesterday.
The haul, weighing just over a tonne with an estimated street value of
Pounds 160m, was brought into a wharf at Woolwich Reach, London, aboard the
Panamanian-registered vessel Fox Trot Five.
It brought cocaine seizures so far this year to about 2.7 tonnes - more than
the total for all of last year, when 1.061 tonnes, worth Pounds 138.4m, was
intercepted.
Scotland Yard said the operation, codenamed Emerge, followed months of
intensive intelligence gathering and surveillance. A police officer
accidentally fired a shot during the raid but no one was injured. A number
of people were arrested by officers from the London-based No 9 Regional
Crime Squad and Customs.
An eye-witness said Fox Trot Five was boarded by about two dozen officers
armed with machine guns and wearing balaclavas.
The previous record seizure was in July, when Customs investigators seized
935kg of cocaine hidden in lead ingots.
Customs said: 'The amount of cocaine being seized is constantly spiralling.
We are delighted to have been able to stop this latest amount reaching the
streets.'
