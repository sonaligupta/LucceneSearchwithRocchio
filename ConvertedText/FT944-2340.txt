FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Plysu declines to Pounds 2.85m


   By PEGGY HOLLINGER


Plysu, the plastic container manufacturer, expects to pay at least an
unchanged dividend this year, despite the adverse effect which sharply
higher raw material prices will have on profits.
Mr David O'Shaughnessy, chairman, who was announcing a 16 per cent fall in
interim profits, said progress in cutting costs and increasing volumes had
been overshadowed by rises in polymer prices of more than 75 per cent. This
represented cost increases of Pounds 1.5m a month across all of Plysu's
businesses.
The full effect of the increases would be felt in the second half. However,
Mr O'Shaughnessy said Plysu would be able to pass through all the price
increases, although that would take time.
The drop in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 3.41m to Pounds 2.85m, for the six
months to September 30 was on sales 2 per cent higher at Pounds 44.7m.
Mr O'Shaughnessy said profits were lower because of both the impact of
higher raw material prices and the negotiation of longer-term contracts with
the dairy companies.
However, with the restructuring announced last year about Pounds 1m in
annualised costs had been cut out of the UK containers business, and Pounds
750,000 from the continental European operation. The underlying trading
position was also improving, he said, with volumes in the juice and dairy
containers business at record levels.
Plysu maintained the interim dividend at 2p. Earnings per share fell from
4.8p to 4p.
