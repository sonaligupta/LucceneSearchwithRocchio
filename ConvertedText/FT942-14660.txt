FT  19 APR 94 / International Company News: Treuhand summoned Schneider over
debts


   By JUDY DEMPSEY


   BERLIN


Treuhand, the eastern Germany privatisation agency, had summoned Mr Jurgen
Schneider, the head of the collapsed construction group that bears his name,
to a meeting in Berlin tomorrow. He faced questions over why he was behind
in payments for seven properties bought from the Treuhand.
Mr Schneider, who fled Germany shortly before the collapse last week, and is
now missing, had already been sent several letters by the Treuhand seeking
clarification on why he was not keeping up with interest payments.
There were also inquiries into delays in paying for other properties
acquired from the agency.
The properties, employing over 2,000 workers, include enterprises and real
estate, all in Leipzig, with the exception of a purchase in Dresden. Mr
Schneider bought these properties from the Treuhand's Leipzig branch between
mid-1991 and December 1993.
The Treuhand says it is owed DM53m (Dollars 30.9m). Yesterday it passed the
case on to the Leipzig and Frankfurt prosecutors. It would not comment on
why it had not taken action earlier, given Mr Schneider's repeated delays in
paying for, or meeting, interest rates.
On November 16, 1992, the Frankfurt developer bought the Thomaskirche Hof, a
prestigious site in Leipzig. But he did not pay until March 17 this year.
The Treuhand is now owed more than DM1.3m in interest payments.
Even before that purchase, the Leipzig branch sold properties to Mr
Schneider, with similar problems over delay in payments. On August 1, 1991,
he bought Bergwerk Eigenturm Kieswerk, a gravel company. Last week, the
Treuhand was still owed DM1.3m in outstanding payments, plus DM340,000 in
interest payments, in connection with the deal.
The Bau und Plannung Gesellschaft Leipzig, a construction company, was sold
to Mr Schneider in November 1991 for DM42m. The Treuhand is owed DM7.3m in
interest. A further DM437,000 in interest payments is owned from October 8,
1991, when Mr Schneider bought Gastronomie Service, a food distribution
business in Leipzig. Interest payments exceeding DM350,000 are outstanding
for Unwelt Technik Luftreinhaltung, an air cleaning business.
Meanwhile, the Treuhand is trying to get back a property in Leipzig Mr
Schneider had negotiated to buy on December 20, 1993, but the contract was
never closed, similar to a real estate property Mr Schneider had wanted to
buy in Dresden.
