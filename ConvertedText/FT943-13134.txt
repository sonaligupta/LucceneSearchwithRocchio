FT  21 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow turns lower in response
to Greenspan


   By FRANK MCGURTY and AP-DJ


   NEW YORK


Wall Street
US stocks suffered a setback yesterday when the chairman of the Federal
Reserve said he could not rule out an early move to tighter money, writes
Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 21.04 lower at 3,727.27 and the
Standard & Poor's 500 lost 2.26 at 451.60. NYSE volume was a moderate 268m
shares. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite slipped a scant
0.90 to 433.00, but the Nasdaq composite buckled 6.55 to 712.77 under the
weight of depressed technology issues.
For at least a week the market had anticipated yesterday's congressional
testimony by Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chief. When he finally delivered his
twice-annual Humphrey-Hawkins briefing half an hour after trading began, the
tone and substance of his remarks were a surprise.
He said the central bank was still uncertain whether credit conditions were
sufficiently tight to snuff out inflationary pressures in the economy. He
added that a further lifting of interest rates was still 'an open question'.
With the prospect of a fresh period of uncertainty over monetary policy, the
bond market went into decline. The price of the benchmark 30-year government
issue was down nearly a point, even though the Commerce Department released
data suggesting a cooling of the housing sector.
Share prices followed bonds to sharply lower levels, managed to recover
somewhat in the late morning but fell again in the afternoon. The overall
weakness was complicated by the flood of corporate results which continued
to pour into Wall Street. In general, investors were unimpressed by good
performances and unforgiving to underachievers.
Sears Roebuck, for one, handily beat the consensus forecast by posting net
income of Dollars 1.27 a share in the second quarter, but its share price
declined Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 46. Compaq Computer failed to please even
though its quarterly net income was a little better than forecast. The stock
shed Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 31 3/4 on heavy volume of 7.9m amid concern
over the company's high inventory levels.
Similarly, McDonnell Douglas, the defence contractor, disappointed investors
even though it matched expectations. Its share price was marked down Dollars
4 1/8 to Dollars 114 3/8 .
Bearishness claimed Pfizer as a victim, too. The pharmaceuticals house
warned that its full-year results could fall short of early estimates. In
response, the stock dropped Dollars 2 to Dollars 60 1/8 . International Game
Technology was a big loser after posting net income of 30 cents a share, an
unpleasant surprise to most analysts. The issue gave back Dollars 1 5/8 to
Dollars 19 7/8 .
Cadence Design Systems, a computer software concern, plunged 23 per cent, or
Dollars 4 1/8 , to Dollars 13 1/4 amid concern about its growth prospects.
On the Nasdaq, a downturn in technology shares triggered earlier in the week
showed no signs of abating. Shares in Microsoft, which released its results
at the session's close, dropped Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 48 3/8 . Canada
Toronto finished lower following moderate trading. The TSE 300 composite
index retreated 18.4 to 4,181.7 and declines led advances by 403 to 340
after volume of 56.3m shares.
Banking stocks recorded the day's biggest loss, the index falling 1.73 per
cent.
Argentina
Share prices on the Buenos Aires stock exchange fell yesterday as several
bomb scares, coming two days after an explosion levelled a Jewish community
centre, unnerved local investors, reports AP-DJ.
'There was a delayed reaction' to Monday's blast, said one Buenos Aires
trader. He added that reports of bomb scares at several sites around Buenos
Aires prompted the sort of sell-off that had been expected earlier in the
week.
The blast early on Monday at a building housing two Jewish organisations
killed at least 33 people and injured 157. More than 70 others were reported
missing.
Renewed concern that the US Federal Reserve will lift interest rates also
weighed down local equities.
The broad General index closed 369.40, or 1.9 per cent, off at 18,614.53,
while the Merval index of leading shares dropped 17.69, or 3.3 per cent, to
517.49. Falls outnumbered rises by 37 to 2.
Brazil
Stocks in Sao Paulo climbed sharply as a new opinion poll favoured Senator
Fernando Henrique Cardoso for the October 3 presidential race and the
government resolved a pay dispute with public employees and the military.
The Bovespa index ended 1,640, or 4.2 per cent, up at 40,386.
