FT  30 JAN 92 / International Company News: Nine Canadian telecoms sign
marketing deal


   By BERNARD SIMON


NINE Canadian telephone utilities are forming a new company to co-ordinate
their move into international markets and to oversee research and marketing
of domestic telephone services, writes Bernard Simon.
The new company, Stentor Resource Centre, comprises all but one of the
shareholders of Telecom Canada, the alliance which administers Canada's
domestic long-distance system. Stentor is expected to start operations next
January with about 2,500 employees.
Stentor will be dominated by Bell Canada, the biggest of the phone
companies. Bell, subsidiary of Montreal-based BCE, provides service to most
of Ontario and Quebec and has a substantial shareholding in several smaller
provincial companies.
The utilities face pressure on their monopoly of the Canadian telephone
system. Regulators are due to decide within the next few months whether to
open the long-distance market to competition.
