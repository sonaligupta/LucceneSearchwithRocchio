FT  13 NOV 93 / Euro move on seatbelt ruling


BRITAIN could after all legislate to make seatbelts compulsory in buses or
coaches, the European Commission said yesterday, in an attempt to clear up
confusion over European law on the issue in the wake of Wednesday's fatal M2
coach crash.
The commission said the UK could impose such obligations on British coach
and bus operators. It would be illegal for operators to try to circumvent
such a law by using only foreign-registered coaches.
