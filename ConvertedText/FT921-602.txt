FT  28 MAR 92 / Letter: The right language


   From Mr PETER HUNT


Sir, Christopher Lorenz's article, 'Sum total adds up to more than the
figures' (March 6), was an interesting one, with a sting in its tail.
As a Fellow of the Institute of Personnel Management I might have taken
umbrage at the thought that Personnel use 'arcane language', but
unfortunately I agree.
One of our weaknesses can be a tendency to communicate in a jargon almost
comparable with that of the computer industry]
But the key issue was hidden in the article in the lines: 'The only totally
common ground between disciplines in business is not finance, but people.'
How true this is. Though management may not need to learn the personnel
language, perhaps we should encourage them to ask Personnel to explain,
simply, how the common sense of dealing with people can be used to harness
employee power and generate a contribution to the organisation's 'bottom
line'.
