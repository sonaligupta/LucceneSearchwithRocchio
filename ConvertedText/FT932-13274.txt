FT  23 APR 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance - Survey of
Investment Trusts (22): Iron out the market's bumps - Many experts see
trusts as an alternative to life products. But the Budget has diminished
Peps / Savings Schemes and Personal Equity Plans


   By JOHN AUTHERS


SAVINGS SCHEMES and personal equity plans offer private investors the safest
entry into the world of investment trusts. To judge by the sales figures,
many people have realised this.
The Association of Investment Trust Companies says that Pounds 115.5m was
invested in savings schemes last year. The sharp drop in investor confidence
during the summer meant that this was lower than 1991's Pounds 119.5m, but
it still shows a vast increase on the Pounds 89,504 taken in 1984, when the
first savings scheme was launched by Foreign & Colonial.
The total invested in savings schemes since their inception now stands at
Pounds 430m. However, this is still rather less than the billions which have
been invested in life assurance endowment policies.
Can this be justified? Many advisers believe that investment trusts have the
edge, over both life assurance products and unit trusts.
Tony Shepherd, of Shepherd Associates, says: 'We use investment trust
savings schemes because investment trusts generally are fairly broadly
based, as opposed to unit trusts where you would need several to get a
spread.'
He adds that those who already have a wide portfolio of UK equities might be
better off feeding money into international unit trusts.
The arguments for investment trusts over endowments are stronger, and less
subtle. As Shepherd puts it: 'Endowments are inflexible, they have very high
charges and they are paying for commission in advance. Also, given the state
of the with-profits market, it's very difficult to know which life companies
will produce the goods in 10 years' time.'
He admits that life assurance-linked maximum investment plans can be good
value if held for the full 10 years, but they have to be held this long.
Investment trust savings schemes can be surrendered at any time without
penalty. According to Shepherd: 'Why commit yourself to anything when you
don't have to?'
Investment trust savings schemes are straightforward - you organise a
standing order with your bank, which then pays money regularly into a
specially organised account. This then buys and holds the shares.
Buying the shares through regular savings, rather than in one lump sum, is
safer for small investors, as it eliminates the hazards of timing. Buying in
instalments avoids the risk that you will buy only at the top of the market,
and improves the chances that you will buy at least some of the shares when
their prices are low. This way, volatile share prices can be turned to your
advantage.
However, if the share price rises steadily and consistently, without
fluctuation, you would get better value from investing in a lump sum.
Once you have established that you need an investment trust savings scheme,
you need to choose a trust. This will depend on two factors:
Performance. As all the advertisements dutifully tell you, past performance
is no guarantee of future results. But it does allow some well-educated
guesses. International General and UK Income are the main sectors which
attract interest from advisers, as these have the largest and broadest based
portfolios, with a lengthy track record.
The figures in the table, provided by Micropal, show the results of
investing Pounds 100 per month since the beginning of 1988. Charges for sale
of the trusts are not included, but investment is shown with net, rather
than gross income reinvested. On these assumptions, the average trust in
both sectors managed to increase the money invested by about 50 per cent.
The strongest performers, Bankers and Personal Assets in the International
General sector, both came close to producing double the total amount of
money invested - very creditable performance for a five-year period,
particularly as this included 1990, when the UK stock market sustained
losses ahead of the Gulf War.
Peps became available at the beginning of 1988, so it would have been
possible to have income reinvested gross (although the rules have restricted
the amount which can be invested in international trusts). Pep investment
would avoid capital gains tax, although no capital gains tax would in fact
have been payable at this level of saving after five years.
Charges. Performance may not be predictable in advance, but charges are.
Typically, these will include some combination of stockbroking commission,
and charges on purchase or sale. Some will charge for share certificates.
The majority of schemes do not have a stockbroking commission; and none,
with the exception of the split-capital TR Technology, charges more than
0.25 per cent. Charges on sale or transfer are typically Pounds 10 or Pounds
15, although again some management groups do not levy a charge. Companies
which stand out, according to the AITC, are Dunedin, Finsbury and Ivory &
Sime, all of which charge no stockbroking commission, and levy no other
charges. With any savings scheme it is vital that you check the level of
charges before starting the payments.
Peps
Quarterly Review readers will know by now the advantages of personal equity
plans - they allow you to reinvest income gross, and shelter you from
capital gains tax (not a vital issue for most small investors).
However, the advantages of a Pep were reduced by the changes to advance
corporation tax (ACT) in the Budget. For basic-rate taxpayers, the tax
saving was cut by a quarter. On an investment of Pounds 6,000 in a trust
yielding 4 per cent, the tax benefit drops from Pounds 60 to Pounds 45 in
the first year. Higher-rate taxpayers still save 40 per cent in tax, but
their income from a Pep is cut by 6.25 per cent.
More than ever, charges will determine whether a Pep is worthwhile. Many
basic-rate taxpayers may find that trusts with additional tax charges are
unattractive.
It is worth shopping around for a cheap 'self-select' Pep provider, but the
companies themselves also offer their own schemes. Typically, there is an
initial charge, of between 0.5 and 5 per cent, plus an annual charge, and a
charge for dealing (which first-time investment trust investors may well not
need to do). Among the trusts listed, Alliance Trust stands out, with no
initial or annual charge, and a dealing charge of 0.15 per cent.
