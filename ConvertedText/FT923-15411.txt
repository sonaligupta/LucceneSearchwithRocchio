FT  02 JUL 92 / UK protests to EC at French aid for Bull


   By ALAN CANE


MR Michael Heseltine, UK trade and industry secretary, clashed privately
yesterday with Sir Leon Brittan. the EC competition commissioner, over the
FFr7bn (Pounds 710m) aid which the French government is planning to provide
to Bull, the loss-making French computer maker, Alan Cane writes.
Sir Leon is expected to announce today that he has approved the cash
injection, needed for restructuring costs and to help Bull rejuvenate its
technology. Bull is state-owned, with France Telecom, IBM and NEC holding
small stakes.
Mr Heseltine told Sir Leon that to allow state aid to some companies while
others, including the UK's ICL, went through the costly restructuring
process using their own resources, undermined EC competition policy.
