FT  06 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Recession leaves Somic in the red


With almost all areas of its business affected by the recession, Somic, the
paper spinner and weaver, reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 113,528 for the
year ended March 31 1992, against Pounds 50,113 profits before. Turnover
fell 11 per cent to Pounds 3.5m.
The directors said they were taking continuing action to reverse this
position and a gradual improvement was expected this year. Losses per share
for the year were 2.83p (1.69p earnings) but the final dividend is held at
1p.
New product developments had taken longer to materialise than envisaged.
