FT  05 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Turkey close to Libyan debt deal


   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN


   ISTANBUL


TURKEY is near to winning Libyan agreement to settle a Dollars 600m (Pounds
314m) debt owed to Turkish contractors, if details of a protocol involving a
debt-for-oil swap can be finalised, John Murray Brown reports from Istanbul.
Officials from the Turkish Eximbank and Libya's Umma Bank last week
initialled terms to provide payment to Turkish contractors for the first
time since September 1990. Mr Ozer Olcmen, head of the Union of Turkish
Contractors in Libya, said Tupras, the Turkish oil company, has still to fix
a price for the Libyan crude, proceeds of which would be lodged in an
account in the Eximbank to repay Turkish contractors. He expected final
agreement in the next 10 days.
Turkish contractors have done more than Dollars 10bn-worth of deals since
the early 1980s, building infrastructure for the Libyan oil industry. At one
time, over 200 Turkish companies were engaged in this market. Today, 38
Turkish groups are owed Dollars 282m by Libya, according to Turkish figures.
The balance is owed by local Libyan authorities.
Mr Olcmen traces the problem to Turkey having made its lira convertible in
1990. To comply with terms of an IMF pact, Ankara had to close the account
held by the Turkish bank through which Libyan payments were made.
