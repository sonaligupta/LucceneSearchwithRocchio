FT  28 APR 94 / Final honour for disgraced president who won back respect


Five presidents pay homage to Richard Nixon at his funeral yesterday in his
home town of Yorba Linda, California. Bill Clinton stands to attention with
George Bush, Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford and their wives.
Clinton paid tribute to Nixon, who died on Saturday, as a patriot, a keen
intellect and a fighter who made mistakes but whose life must be judged in
the totality of his record. 'He made mistakes and they, like his
accomplishments, are part of his life and record.'
