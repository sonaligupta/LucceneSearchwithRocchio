FT  15 NOV 93 / Accounts standards set to be tightened


   By ANDREW JACK


THE ACCOUNTING Standards Board, the financial reporting standards-setting
body, is preparing to clamp down on provisions and pensions valuations in
draft statements to be issued next year.
Mr David Tweedie, chairman, said he planned to develop new standards on
general provisions, write-downs on assets and pension-fund valuations.
The details emerged shortly before the board is to issue revised drafts of
standards on pre-acquisition provisions and the treatment of goodwill in
company accounts. The drafts are likely to spark controversy.
They come after a meeting last week of accounting standards-setting bodies
around the world, at which officials resolved to co-operate more closely and
to develop standards in collaboration.
Traditionally companies have been able to manipulate profits by writing-back
provisions they have not used, which allows them to boost profits
artificially in future years.
They argue that making provisions complies with the fundamental accounting
concept of prudence. But Mr Tweedie said that, while provisions may be
prudent for the balance sheet, they 'whitewash' the profit-and-loss account.
