FT  17 MAR 94 / Hurd seeks EU compromise


Foreign secretary Douglas Hurd told Conservative MPs he was not prepared to
see enlargement of the European Union fail over the issue of the blocking
veto. Hoping to unite the Tory party behind a compromise, he said
enlargement was a policy in Britain's national interests. Ministers are
still fighting to prevent the number of votes needed to block legislation
from rising from 23 to 27. Mr Hurd is understood to have told backbenchers
that '23 is best'.
