FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: LMS gains 30% with aid of property sales


   By SIMON LONDON, Property Correspondent


London Merchant Securities, the property and investment company, reported a
30 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 10.1m to Pounds
13.1m, helped by gains on the disposal of investment properties.
Net rental income improved from Pounds 14.8m to Pounds 15.7m in the six
months to the end of September, partly offset by a 25 per cent rise in
administrative costs to Pounds 2.6m. The company said these expenses
included the cost of its High Court action against shareholders in BSB
Holdings, the old British Satellite Broadcasting holding company which owns
14 per cent of BSkyB.
LMS claims the terms under which it was offered shares during BSB's 1991
rights issue were unfair. The case should come to trial in January.
The company's 5 per cent holding in BSB Holdings remains valued at nil in
the balance sheet despite the recent flotation of BSkyB.
Dividends received from First Leisure Corporation, the leisure company in
which LMS has a 14.6 per cent stake, contributed other income of Pounds
632,000 (Pounds 596,000).
Profits from the sale of investment properties were Pounds 6.5m (Pounds 2m)
and included proceeds from the disposal of assets held jointly with General
Accident, the insurance company. LMS said GA remained a large shareholder
and that opportunities for collaboration in new ventures were being
explored.
Earnings per share, including capital items, rose from 2.31p to 4.27p, but
fell from 1.97p to 1.48p on revenue profit alone. The interim dividend is
unchanged at 0.8p.
