FT  27 JAN 94 / International Company News: Lower copper prices hit sales at
Asarco


   By LAURIE MORSE


Asarco, the US integrated copper company whose Arizona operations have been
dogged by flooding problems, reported a fourth-quarter operating loss before
tax benefits and special gains of Dollars 59.3m or Dollars 1.42 per share,
compared with a loss of Dollars 98.6m or Dollars 2.36 per share a year
earlier.
During the quarter, Asarco began recognising income from its 80 per cent
ownership of Corporacion Minera Nor Peru, a Peruvian mining concern.
That recognition, and special accounting treatment, gave Asarco a one-time
gain of Dollars 104.5m. Including the gain, Asarco reported a profit of
Dollars 73.7m or Dollars 1.78 per share for the quarter.
Although the company managed to trim operating losses, it said that its
fourth-quarter sales dipped to Dollars 435.5m, from Dollars 471.9m in the
fourth quarter of 1992.
The decline in fourth-quarter sales was linked to lower copper and lead
prices. Asarco said that its average realised price for copper dropped to 78
cents per pound in the quarter, from Dollars 1 a pound a year earlier, and
the average price for lead to 21 cents a pound from 24 cents.
For the full year, Asarco's operating losses hit Dollars 134.6m or Dollars
3.23 per share before taxes and other benefits, on sales of Dollars 1.73bn.
That compares with losses of Dollars 69.1m or Dollars 1.66 per share on
sales of Dollars 1.9bn for the 1992 fiscal year.
