   By REUTER


   OUAGADOUGOU


Leaders of seven former French West African colonies gathered yesterday to
lobby for more foreign help to cope with a 50 per cent devaluation of their
common currency, the CFA franc, Reuter reports from Ouagadougou.
International Monetary Fund officials were present to hear the plea. The IMF
is rushing through soft-loan agreements to help CFA countries get relief
from international creditors.
