FT  19 APR 91 / Danes may block end of sanctions


   By HILARY BARNES

Danish opposition parties are set to force Prime Minister Poul Schluter's
centre-right minority government to block a decision by the European
Community to lift the remaining trade restrictions on South Africa, Hilary
Barnes writes from Copenhagen.
The move is aimed as a snub to South Africa's President F W de Klerk, who is
due to pay a one-day visit to Denmark next week.
Mr Schluter's minority government of the Conservative and Liberal parties is
backed by only 69 MPs in the 179-seat assembly. A coalition of the Social
Democratic party, the Socialist People's party and the Radicals, a small
centre party, with a total of 91 seats, has emerged to block government
policy on the embargo issue.
