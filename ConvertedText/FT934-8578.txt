HQ


TRAFALGAR HOUSE CONSTRUCTION has started work on its Pounds 33m management
contract overseeing the construction and fitting out of a 350,000 sq ft
office block - to become the new headquarters for the Scottish Office - in
Leith, Scotland.
The four-storey building is being built for Victoria Quay at the water's
edge at Victoria Quay in the Port of Leith.
Three Scottish Office departments are to occupy the building which has been
specifically tailored to their requirements. The building will be divided
into three units, each arranged around its own internal atrium. All of the
units will be connected by a series of open courtyards and internal
walkways.
The south facade will feature a two-storey colonnade running the full length
of the building.
A public auditorium with raked seating will be located on the ground floor
and conference rooms for 240 people will also be provided.
Other facilities will include a library/shop, reference and reading rooms,
restaurant and coffee lounge.
There will be a 25m swimming pool in a glazed enclosure in the courtyard at
the east end of the building.
New infrastructure to be built includes roads and bridges and 650 car
spaces.
