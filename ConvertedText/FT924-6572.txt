FT  20 NOV 92 / International Company News: Morgan Stanley slips to Dollars
110.6m


   By PATRICK HARVERSON


MORGAN Stanley, the Wall Street securities house, yesterday reported a
slight fall in third-quarter net income to Dollars 110.6m, compared with the
Dollars 121.8m earned in the same period last year.
The results were in line with market forecasts, so Morgan Stanley shares
were virtually unchanged at Dollars 53 on the New York Stock Exchange.
The company blamed the drop in earnings on a contraction in new equity
offerings, and lower revenues from its principal trading business.
The figures would have been more disappointing but for the Dollars 42.6m
gain Morgan Stanley earned from the sale of its stake in MS/Essex Holdings,
and an increase in the carrying value of its investment in Kohl's
Corporation.
Although the company enjoyed strong results from foreign exchange, swaps and
government bond trading (some of the gains were undoubtedly linked to the
turmoil in European bond and currency markets during September), they were
more than offset by poor results in equity and commodities trading.
Overall, Morgan Stanley's earnings from trading for its own account dropped
15.6 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 300.8m.
Investment banking revenues declined 6 per cent to Dollars 182.3m, a
reflection of the fall-off in equity securities offerings and merger
activity.
The volume of debt issuance rose during the period, thanks to continued
healthy demand from US and foreign corporations for bond underwriting
services.
Commission revenues were down 3 per cent to Dollars 968.6m, but earnings
from asset management (a fast-growing area for most Wall Street firms) and
administration services jumped more than 40 per cent to Dollars 57m.
Expenses excluding interest rose 8 per cent to Dollars 575.8m, due primarily
to higher compensation payouts, occupancy and equipment costs and brokerage,
clearing and exchange fees.
