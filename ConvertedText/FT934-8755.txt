FT  13 NOV 93 / Japanese must build up a life outside work, says agency

JAPANESE people need to develop personal relationships and seek a purpose in
life outside work to avoid misery in old age, according to the Economic
Planning Agency.
In its annual white paper on the quality of life, the agency says the
Japanese face a need to turn away from a company-centred lifestyle to one
that seeks meaning in personal relationships and private social activities.
With the increase in free time, as working hours are shortened and more
people expect a longer life after retirement, the report says 'the lack of
personal relationships at home or in the community, particularly among grown
men who have left their jobs', has become a social issue.
The end of the so-called economic bubble of the 1980s has also reawakened an
awareness that material comforts alone cannot provide satisfaction in life.
'In order to attain spiritual fulfilment, it is important to have a variety
of options in life and be able to experience satisfaction through personal
realisation,' the white paper says.
One way to do so, the agency suggests, is to create a private world through
reading and hobbies and by improving family ties. The agency also counsels
volunteer work, thinking about nature, spending time in the countryside, and
more communication with people of other nations.
The EPA's report reflects growing concern that a lifetime spent in
dedication to a company is leaving a growing number of Japanese men
spiritually and emotionally lost once they retire.
According to an agency survey, more than 67 per cent of those questioned
aged 65 and over, and 64 per cent of those in their early 60s, saw the
meaning of life in their work. Only 25 per cent of Japanese in their 20s
felt that way.
