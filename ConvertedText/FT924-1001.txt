   WASHINGTON


The US and Russia have made 'real progress' in talks on additional cuts in
long-range nuclear weapons but are not yet ready to sign a Start-2 treaty,
President George Bush said yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington.
Russian President Boris Yeltsin surprised officials in Washington last week
when he said a Start-2 pact would be signed before Mr Bush stepped down.
