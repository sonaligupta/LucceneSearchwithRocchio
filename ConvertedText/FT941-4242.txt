FT  11 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Recs setback


   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON


Regional electricity stocks (Recs) were given an uncomfortable ride as
marketmakers, seeking to find a viable trading level for the shares, cut
prices with increasing vigour throughout the session, trying to uncover
cheap buyers.
Utilities specialists were at pains to point out that there was no scare
story or bad news behind the recent bout of weakness in the shares, other
than the slide in index-linked gilts, which often prove a reliable guide to
trends in the utilities. 'There is no big news on these stocks until the
distribution review in the summer,' said one analyst, who added that the rec
yields were approaching all-time relative highs.
The two recs in the FT-SE 100, Eastern and Southern, fell 13 and 14 to 625p
and 635p respectively. Others absorbed even bigger losses, with Norweb 19
off at 649p.
The day's highest volume of the FT-SE 100 constituents was recorded in
conglomerate BTR, which resisted the market's afternoon fall after
surprising dealers with a 13.4 per cent dividend increase and a 19 per cent
improvement in profits.
Turnover at the close was 24m and the shares closed 10 ahead at 387p.
Analysts were particularly cheered by a positive results meeting and several
brokers upgraded current year profit expectations. The list of upgrades
included Strauss Turnbull which raised its forecast from Pounds 1.38bn to
Pounds 1.495bn, a figure which includes gains on disposals.
Bank stocks were sharply in focus as Barclays completed the results season
by announcing disappointing figures. However, an early downturn in the share
price was reversed as analysts returned from the post-results meeting
satisfied with Barclays' strategy plans. 'The figures were bad but the
market is still in love with Martin Taylor (the chief executive),' said one
dealer.
Barclays fell to 488p after the results but rallied to close 8 higher at
510p. Turnover of 18m shares was the heaviest since last year's preliminary
figures, which included the shattering news that the dividend was being cut.
Abbey National, up 9 at 498p, and Lloyds, 11 firmer at 578p, were the other
strong performers in the sector.
A block of 3m National Westminster shares was thought to have been
successfully placed only marginally below the ruling market price. NatWest
ended a penny off at 466p.
Willis Corroon's figures were well received, the shares advancing 16 to 223p
on heavy turnover of 5.6m. Results from Refuge, the life group, proved an
acute disappointment to the market, however, the stock sliding 21 to 359p.
Leading pharmaceutical issues were weak in late trading as news reports said
that Mrs Hillary Clinton, who heads the US administration's health care
reform programme, might have invested in a hedge fund which sold short
several health care stocks last year.
Glaxo closed 2 1/2 lower at 661p and SmithKline Beecham 'A' shed 3 to 395p.
Wellcome declined 9 to 626p, with analysts expecting imminent publication of
last year's Anglo-French Concorde study which found that AZT, the Aids
treatment, was less effective than previously thought.
Smith & Nephew firmed a penny to 144 1/2 p on full-year profits of Pounds
170.6m.
Chemicals stocks were strong against the trend, with Smith New Court
recommending ICI, Courtaulds and Laporte. ICI gained 8 at 775p and started
to show signs of breaking out of a tight range, Courtaulds advanced 11 to
553p and Laporte added 9 at 804p with Hoare Govett also on the bid.
Conglomerate Hanson hardened a penny to 271 1/2 p after announcing the
long-awaited terms for the flotation of its Beazer Homes business in the UK.
Hanson has set a price of 165p per share. It is selling 280.8m shares but
only making 70.2m available to the public.
A rise in profits in line with market expectations from Hillsdown was offset
by a disappointing results meeting. The shares lost 8 at 166p.
Food retailers were generally firm, with SG Warburg reiterating its positive
stance on the sector. Analyst Mr Neil Currie said the downside to further
margin erosion in the industry - an issue which has crippled the supermarket
stocks' rating - was now extremely limited. Warburg is particularly keen on
J. Sainsbury, up 6 at 368p.
Mirror Group Newspapers climbed 12 to 186p on hefty institutional buying
that saw 3.7m shares traded. Next week's results are likely to be well
received.
Advertisers Saatchi & Saatchi rose 5 to 146p ahead of figures due next
Tuesday.
TI Group tumbled 25 to 409p, recording the day's biggest retreat among FT-SE
100 stocks, with analysts unimpressed by the company's post-results meeting.
