FT  27 SEP 94 / Survey of Mauritius (4): Predictions confounded


More than 30 years ago, the eminent Cambridge economist Professor James
Meade, led an official inquiry into the Mauritian economy.
He concluded, gloomily, that unless effective birth control measures were
introduced 'fairly promptly', the island faced 'ultimate catastrophe'.
The Meade report was based on data which suggested that the population,
estimated at 600,000 in 1960, was growing at 3 per cent annually and would
top the 3m mark by the turn of the century.
In the event, the rate of population increase since 1970 has been less than
1 per cent a year, and the economy which Professor Meade then described as
'a case study in Malthusian economics', has been increasingly constrained,
not by the excessive growth in the population that he had expected, but by
an acute shortage of labour.
