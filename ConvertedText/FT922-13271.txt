FT  13 APR 92 / UK Company News: Hachidai declared insolvent

HACHIDAI Corporation, an apartment and resort developer, has been been
declared insolvent by Japanese credit research agencies, following the
suspension of bank transactions with the ailing company, which has
outstanding debts of Y114bn (Dollars 858m).
The collapse of Hachidai, also a dealer in golf club memberships and a
hospital proprietor, is the fourth largest in Japan this year, and shows
that Japanese banks are not willing to restructure all troubled clients,
particularly those with heavy exposure in the property market.
The three largest bankruptcies so far this year have been linked to the
Koshin stock speculators group, with the largest failure that of KSG, which
had Y142.4bn in outstanding debts. Mr Mitsuhiro Kotani, the Koshin head
charged with allegedly manipulating stock prices, was declared bankrupt
earlier this week with personal debts of Y122.5bn
Banks are wary of con-tinuing their relationships with scandal-tainted
companies, and Hachidai was linked to a controversy involving the alleged
mismanagement of its hospital in December last year.
The company, along with many other mid-sized property developers, has been
hurt by the higher interest rates and the fall in apartment and golf club
membership prices, as well by a finance ministry order that banks limit
property-related lending.
