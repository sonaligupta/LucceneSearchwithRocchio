FT  25 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Lloyd's probe at Bain Clarkson


Bain Clarkson, the insurance broking subsidiary of Inchcape, yesterday
confirmed that it has been the subject of disciplinary investigations by the
authorities at Lloyd's of London, which regulates itself.
The investigations began in October and concern 'grossing up' and other
market practices by Bain staff.
Bain said, however, that there was no evidence of fraud or dishonesty and
that the situation was not 'expected to have any financial significance to
the company'.
The company intends making no further comment until the outcome of the
inquiry is known.
