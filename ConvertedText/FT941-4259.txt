FT  11 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: Budapest SE to allow foreign
listings


   By REUTER


   BUDAPEST


The Budapest Stock Exchange has issued a list of international financial
institutions that would be allowed, if they so requested, to introduce
Hungarian forint-denominated securities on the bourse, Reuter reports from
Budapest.
The list was drawn up after the bourse amended its rules to allow foreign
financial institutions to bring such securities.
However, a stock exchange official said that Hungarian securities law would
also have to be amended before foreign institutions could introduce
forint-denominated securities. He added that this was under way.
The bourse listed the following organisations:
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the European
Investment Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the International Finance
Corporation, and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
The Inter-American Development Bank, the Nordic Development Bank, the
Caribbean Development Bank, the African Development Bank, and the Asian
Development Bank were also on the list.
Hungary's move to allow foreign institutions to list on the stock exchange
was triggered by the EBRD's plan to introduce a forint-denominated bond on
the Budapest bourse.
'The bourse council wanted to make it possible for the securities of these
financial institutions to appear (on the bourse),' a stock exchange
spokesman said. He added, however, that 'no official request has come from
any of them yet.'
