FT  27 MAY 93 / Investor disputes up 50% in year


   By PHILIP COGGAN


COMPLAINTS to the investment ombudsman, who resolves disputes between
investors and members of Imro, the investment management regulator, rose 50
per cent last year.
Mr Richard Youard, the ombudsman, said in his annual report the increase may
have occurred because Imro had given greater publicity to the scheme. The
overall amount paid in compensation following the involvement of the
ombudsman fell to Pounds 40,700 from Pounds 114,000.
Many complaints focused on alleged negligence by advisers. One example cited
was an adviser who failed to inform an 80-year-old woman of what would
happen to her investments when she died.
Claims ranged from Pounds 5 - a demand for interest on cash held within a
personal equity plan - to Pounds 350,000, involving an investor in a hotel
partnership in which the ombudsman felt unable to adjudicate.
The ombudsman said there were some hopeful signs of improvement in the
industry, with documentation getting better.
He added: 'Two years ago, I complained about bad or non-existent factfinds
and of inadequate, if any, contemporaneous notes. Cases this year have
shown, on the whole, satisfactory factfinds and useful contemporaneous
notes.'
But the ombudsman added that investors 'often show unrealistic expectations,
confusion between different types of investment and a general lack of
understanding of how the markets work'.
The investment ombudsman has powers to make individual awards up to a
maximum of Pounds 100,000. The costs of his services are met by a levy on
Imro members.
Details and copies of a free complaints leaflet explaining how to complain
about an Imro member are available from the Office of the Investment
Ombudsman, 6 Frederick's Place, London EC2R 8BT.
