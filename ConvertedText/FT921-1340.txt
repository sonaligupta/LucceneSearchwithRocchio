FT  25 MAR 92 / Recruit Claims Fourth Victim


   By STEFAN WAGSTYL


   TOKYO


A JAPANESE former senior civil servant was yesterday given a suspended jail
sentence and fined for his part in the Recruit bribery scandal which rocked
Japan three years ago, Stefan Wagstyl reports from Tokyo.
Mr Takeshi Kato, once a vice-minister in the labour ministry, was found
guilty of having accepted bribes from Recruit, an employment information
company. He was sentenced to two years in jail, suspended for three years,
and fined Y6.81m (Pounds 29,700) at the Tokyo District Court.
Mr Kato is the fourth person to be convicted on charges arising from the
Recruit affair, in which the company offered cut-price stock to influential
people in return for their favour. They include Mr Hisashi Shinto,
ex-chairman of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the telecommunications
utility. Eight others are still on trial, among them Mr Takao Fujinami, a
former chief cabinet secretary.
Mr Taketaka Nakagawa, the presiding judge, told Mr Kato the case was grave
because he had damaged people's trust in the labour ministry and in the
fairness of government officials.
