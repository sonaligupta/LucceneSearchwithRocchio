FT  02 NOV 93 / Salinas calls for poll civility pact


   By DAMIAN FRASER


   MEXICO CITY


PRESIDENT Carlos Salinas yesterday called on all Mexico's political parties
to sign a pact of civility to ensure 'transparent and exemplary'
presidential elections next August.
In his annual state of the nation address, President Salinas promised the
contenders 'full respect, abiding by the terms of the law, and proper
conditions for them to present their options to Mexicans in full freedom'.
Mexico's 1988 presidential election, which brought Mr Salinas to power, was
widely held by observers to have been marred by ballot-rigging. Mr Salinas's
government has recently passed new democratic reforms, but they have been
dismissed as inadequate by the main opposition candidate, Mr Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas, and some foreign and domestic observers.
Despite the call for an electoral pact, Mr Salinas suggested there would no
more significant concessions to the opposition.
The president appeared to rule out the possibility of foreign observers
participating in the electoral process, saying 'only Mexicans' would be the
guardians of 'our' democracy.
The president announced that Mexico's reserves rose to Dollars 23.017bn
(Pounds 15.2bn) at the end of October, from Dollars 22.597bn.
