FT  21 NOV 92 / Scots authority plan 'unwanted'


   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent


THE SCOTTISH Office's plans to create a single-tier system of local
government in place of the present two-tier structure are 'unwanted and
unwelcome', Mr Charles Gray, president of the Convention of Scottish Local
Authorities, said yesterday.
The Scottish Office last month issued a consultation document proposing
various ways of redrawing the local council map of Scotland. Between 15 and
51 single-tier authorities would be set up instead of the nine regional and
51 district councils. Some functions straddling more than one authority
would be handled by joint boards.
Mr Gray argued that the question of local government ought to be examined by
an independent commission. The convention had hoped that single-tier
councils would follow the setting up of a Scottish parliament.
Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, told the same conference in Edinburgh, that
the consultation exercise was genuine. 'There is no map, already prepared,
sitting on a shelf, waiting to be dusted off.'
Savings were likely to arise from the proposed unitary structure, he said.
While Mr Gray, until recently convener of Strathclyde regional council,
which comprises nearly half Scotland's population, has long opposed the
abolition of regional councils, some representatives of district councils
also voiced reservations.
They believe the new unitary councils will not gain all the powers now in
the hands of regional councils and that there will be little democratic
control over functions handled by joint boards.
