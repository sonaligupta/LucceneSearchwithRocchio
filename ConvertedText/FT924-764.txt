FT  22 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Fletcher King shows 34% slide


FLETCHER KING, the commercial estate agency and management concern, suffered
further from the deterioration in the economy and property market in the six
months ended October 31 1992.
Mr David Fletcher, chairman, said the company had done well to hold the
decline in turnover to under 6 per cent, at Pounds 2.53m against Pounds
2.68m. The pre-tax profit, however, tumbled 34 per cent, from Pounds 108,000
to Pounds 71,000.
The volume of transactions increased by more than 13 per cent, although the
average fee was some 17 per cent lower.
Howard Associates, the construction management, project management and
quantity surveying subsidiary, continued to perform well and again made a
significant contribution.
Earnings per share slipped to 0.5p (0.8p) and the interim dividend is again
0.5p.
