FT  03 SEP 93 / International Company News: Heineken ahead at midterm


   By DAVID BROWN


HEINEKEN, Europe's largest brewer, reports a first-half rise in net profits
before extraordinary items of 11.3 per cent, but says margins will be
squeezed and the rate of earnings growth will likely slow in the second
half.
Heineken said this slowdown would be due primarily to market conditions, and
was based on the assumption that costs stemming from last week's recall of
3.4m faulty beer bottles could be contained and even recovered.
In the first half, earnings on ordinary operations advanced to Fl 220m
(Dollars 118.2m) from Fl 197.7m. This was in spite of a decline in turnover
to Fl 4.52bn amid weak demand in Europe.
Heineken said it was able to maintain and in some cases extend its market
share in Europe, which accounts for more than two thirds of total turnover,
even though the overall market was in decline with low volume sales.
The decline was particularly pronounced in Spain, Italy, France and the
Netherlands, the group reported, while Asia and North America remained
strong markets for Dutch-brewed exports. Margins were maintained due in part
to robust sales in the premium end of these markets, with lagers sold under
the Heineken and Amstel brand names.
Heineken also attributed its performance to lower restructuring provisions,
and the lower costs that have resulted from earlier rationalisation. The
workforce was reduced 5 per cent to 24,020 over the past year.
Heineken's 51 per cent-owned El Aguila subsidiary cut losses from Pta5.23bn
(Dollars 39.1m) to Pta3.10bn, although the figure for the first half of 1992
included a Pta2.9bn charge for restructuring.
