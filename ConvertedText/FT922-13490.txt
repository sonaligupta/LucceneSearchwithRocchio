FT  11 APR 92 / UK Company News: Serco pays Pounds 12m on move into civil
aviation services


   By ANGUS FOSTER


SERCO GROUP, which provides management and systems for contracts as diverse
as Ministry of Defence radars and one in three of London's traffic lights,
is moving into civil aviation services with the purchase of International
Aeradio, a subsidiary of British Telecommunications, for Pounds 12.25m.
International Aeradio employs 900 people and provides management and systems
for airports, flight information centres and air traffic control. Serco has
provided similar services before, but only to private operators like the
MoD. Mr George Gray, chairman of Serco, said: 'IAL provides a logical
extension to what we have been doing.'
In the year to March 31 1991 IAL incurred a loss of Pounds 969,000 from
turnover of Pounds 32.5m. However, Serco is not buying certain loss-making
health operations and Mr Gray said IAL was now profitable.
More than half of IAL's turnover comes from overseas. The company's main
foreign market is in the Middle East, where it has contracts which include
the provision of airport services to Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Bahrain.
IAL also provides air traffic control services at the Southend, Liverpool
and Cranfield airports in the UK.
