FT  16 JUN 93 / Tax concession on luxury cars


THE government has decided to set a ceiling of Pounds 80,000 on the prices
used in calculations for the new system of company car personal taxation.
The concession followed intense lobbying by luxury carmakers such as
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars and Aston Martin.
While the majority of company car drivers would benefit under the reform, to
be introduced in April next year, drivers of very expensive company cars
would have faced daunting personal tax bills.
