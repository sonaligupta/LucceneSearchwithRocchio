FT  22 OCT 92 / Observer: In memory


What does Tim Martin's newly floated group of 44 greater London pubs have in
common with a failed teacher in the Antipodes? The answer is the group's
title, J D Wetherspoon.
'It was the name of one of my primary teachers in New Zealand, who was the
person I could least imagine ever owning a pub,' explains the 37-year-old
Martin, who yesterday announced a flotation price valuing his stake in the
rapidly expanding chain at more than Pounds 10m.
'I liked the guy, but he was a hopeless student teacher. One of the
inspectors came round, heard him teach us - and he was sacked.'
