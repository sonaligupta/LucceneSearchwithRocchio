FT  23 JUL 93 / Tiphook denies rumours of bidder


   By ANDREW BOLGER


TIPHOOK, the UK transport rental company, yesterday denied that it had been
approached by a potential bidder in an attempt to quash rumours in New York
and London.
Tiphook's shares closed 47p higher at 244p in London yesterday in response
to the speculation, which surfaced the previous day in the US. The group's
American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 11 1/8 .
Mr Robert Montague, chairman, last night addressed a telephone conference of
500 US investors from London to dispel the rumours, which followed the
company's announcement of disappointing results last week.
US television quoted Mr Paul Ehrlichman, managing director of Brandywine
Asset Management, as saying he saw the possibility of a buy-out of Tiphook
over the next six to 12 months. Brandywine owns 1.1m ADRs - 3 per cent of
the equity. Possible suitors cited were other US leasing companies such as
GE Capital, GATX, Transmerica and XTRA. GATX denied it, none of the others
would comment.
Analysts in London were sceptical about the report, pointing out that
Tiphook's Pounds 1bn debt burden would deter most predators, and large
competitors would almost certainly be blocked on competition grounds.
Tiphook said yesterday that it was trading satisfactorily and confirmed that
it would pay the year-end dividend. It had no intention of giving any
price-sensitive information in the presentation to US investors, who now own
more than half the group's equity.
The company has the world's second largest fleet of containers - after
Genstar - and Europe's largest fleet of trailers, but its share price has
halved in less than two years.
The proportion of UK shareholders has fallen over that period from 60 per
cent to below 30 per cent.
