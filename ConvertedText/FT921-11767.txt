FT  30 JAN 92 / International Company News: BBV reports profits up by 4%


   By PETER BRUCE


   MADRID


BANCO Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV), one of Spain's large commercial banks, reported
a 4 per cent increase in net profits for 1991 and a 3 per cent dividend
increase to Pta163.
Mr Emilio Ybarra, president, said net group profits had grown slightly to
Pta109.1bn (Dollars 1.08m), and warned that a general slide in Spanish bank
lending margins had hit the bank.
The bank reported a 50 per cent increase in extra-ordinary income, although
officials at the bank insisted that half of the Pta71bn reported were the
proceeds of trading in its 'normal' portfolio.
The other half was accounted for by the sale of two banking affiliates and
the closure of duplicate branches brought about by the merger of Bilbao and
Vizcaya banks in 1989.
Mr Ybarra acknowledged that BBV's dividend was low, but said that in the
current economic climate, the bank had to be prudent.
Profits have been hit by a sudden explosion in sales of unit trusts, brought
about by new, relaxed tax rules last year, and they are still feeling the
effects of competition.
