FT  06 AUG 93 / DTI investigates banking group


   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent


THE Department of Trade and Industry has launched an investigation into the
affairs of Chancery, a banking and financial services group that went into
administration in February 1991 with net liabilities of Pounds 21.9m.
Inspectors have been appointed under Section 432(2) of the Companies Act
1995, which gives them wide-ranging powers to examine documents and question
witnesses. The inspectors are Mr Anthony Robertshaw, Mr Michael Deveson and
Mr Robert Chandler.
The failure of the banking group, which subsequently came out of
administration, was blamed on over-exposure to commercial property, which
accounted for nearly two thirds of its loan book.
Chancery, based in west London, was founded in 1977 as Chancery Securities
by four chartered accountants. It became the first merchant bank to join the
Unlisted Securities Market in 1985.
Apart from the parent bank, there were 23 subsidiaries, specialising in
factoring, hire purchase instalment credit, stockbroking, business-expansion
scheme sponsorship and other corporate financial services.
In November 1991 Chancery's creditors agreed to a voluntary arrangement to
bring it out of administration. The restructuring plan involved rescheduling
of Pounds 90m of debts over five years and the conversion of the remaining
Pounds 40m of debt into equity.
