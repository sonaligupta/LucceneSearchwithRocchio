FT  24 NOV 92 / Fujimori set to win majority

UNOFFICIAL results from Sunday's Peruvian elections indicate President
Alberto Fujimori will win the overall majority he sought in the new
constituent congress. But his victory has been somewhat marred by a record
number of spoiled and blank votes.
Almost one in four Peruvians turned in a void vote. Although as yet no
official turnout figures have been announced, reports from outlying regions
indicate the abstention rate has been unusually high in a country where
voting is obligatory.
Analysts blame a general disillusionment with politics. But the election
boycott by ex-president Alan Garcia's Apra and twice-president Fernando
Belaunde's Popular Action, Peru's two weightiest parties, clearly left a
significant minority of voters with nowhere to go.
Ms The Popular Christian Party (PPC), the only 'traditional' party to field
candidates, won more votes on Sunday than any other opposition group and its
leader, Ms Lourdes Flores Nano, is likely to emerge as Mr Fujimori's chief
opponent.
The pro-government alliance of Cambio (Change) 90 and New Majority is
expected to end up with 46 seats in the 80-member congress, to be installed
on December 30.
