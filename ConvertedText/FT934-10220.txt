FT  06 NOV 93 / UK Company News: United Biscuits in Indonesian move


United Biscuits has established a new joint venture biscuit business in
Indonesia. UB will own 50 per cent of the company, Ubindo Aneka Biskuit,
with the other shareholder being the Indofood Group, Indonesia's largest
food manufacturer.
Ubindo will begin trading before the end of 1993 and early next year will
move into a state-of-the-art purpose built bakery outside Jakarta.
The new bakery will have an initial capacity of 15,000 tonnes and represents
a total investment of Pounds 11m.
