FT  08 JUN 92 / Observer: Unwinding


Another tell-tale sign that all is not well at Wasserstein Perella, the
high-flying international investment banking boutique?
Alan Stephenson, co-head of the merger and acquisitions advisory group, has
decided to hand in his notice and return to his old law firm, Cravath,
Swaine & Moore.
He insists his decision to jump ship says nothing about the future of
Wasserella, founded by former Wall Street takeover superstars Bruce
Wasserstein and Joe Perella, 'I had never lost my interest in law,' explains
Stephenson who is expected to re-recruit old clients such as Time and CBS.
Even so, the departure of a professional of his calibre suggests that some
of the other big names lured to Wasserella a couple of years ago may be
rethinking their careers.
At 69, the London operation's chairman Lord Haslam is probably too old to
bother about moving. But one wonders how much longer an ambitious type like
Sir Peter Levene, 50-year-old former head of defence procurement at
Britain's defence ministry, is going to hang around.
After all, if Levene was working flat out on Wasserella business, he'd
surely not be collecting odd jobs such as the chairmanship of the Docklands
Light Railway - let alone have the spare time to advise the prime minister
on efficiency.
