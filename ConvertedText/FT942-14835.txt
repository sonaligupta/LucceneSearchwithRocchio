FT  19 APR 94 / Officials act to quell bank sale worries


   By JULIAN OZANNE


Israeli officials yesterday sought to deflect concern about the country's
privatisation programme after the government delayed selling a controlling
stake in Bank Leumi, Israel's second largest bank, Julian Ozanne reports.
Mr Gil Leidner, a senior privatisation official, said the government had
delayed by 30 days closing the tender for the sale of 20 to 40 per cent of
Bank Leumi because of substantial investor interest. Mr Liedner said three
new foreign investors had come forward late in the tender process. Sale of a
controlling stake in Bank Leumi, worth between Dollars 360m and Dollars 720m
(Pounds 244m and Pounds 488m), will be the government's biggest divestiture
so far.
The Finance Ministry has budgeted revenue of Dollars 1.5bn this year from
its sell-off programme which includes controlling stakes in Bank Leumi, Bank
Hapoalim, Bank Mizrahi, Israel Chemicals and El Al, the state-owned airline.
However, some financial analysts speculated that the sale of Bank Leumi was
in trouble and would affect the government's privatisation hopes.
