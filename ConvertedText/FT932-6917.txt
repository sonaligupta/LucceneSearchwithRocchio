FT  26 MAY 93 / International Company News: Hydro-Quebec ahead 16% at
CDollars 520m

HYDRO-QUEBEC, one of Canada's two biggest electrical utilities and a big
international borrower, posted CDollars 520m (USDollars 409m) net profit for
the first quarter, up 16 per cent from a year earlier. The group benefited
from rationalisation and lower interest rates.
The first quarter usually provides most of the year's earnings because of
high industrial, commercial and consumer demand in the severest months of
winter.
But Hydro-Quebec forecasts confidently it will earn at least CDollars 760m
for the full year, well up from 1992, despite the slow recovery.
The utility is 100 per cent owned by the Quebec government.
Last year's heavy rainfall refilled reservoirs after two lean years, so that
in the first quarter it was not forced to buy higher-cost power from New
Brunswick and Ontario to meet peak demand.
Industrial demand was strong, particularly from smelting and pulp and paper,
where operating rates were high. Exports of power to the US were up
slightly, while operating expenses overall fell 5.2 per cent. The 1993
investment programme totals CDollars 4.4bn.
