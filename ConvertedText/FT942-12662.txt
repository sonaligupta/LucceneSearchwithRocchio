FT  28 APR 94 / UK Company News: Leeds Permanent up 37% as bad debts fall


   By ALISON SMITH


Leeds Permanent Building Society yesterday reported pre-tax profits of
Pounds 123.7m for the six months to March 31, up 37 per cent from the
comparable Pounds 90.2m.
Provisions for bad and doubtful debts at Leeds, the UK's fifth largest
society, dropped from Pounds 84.1m to Pounds 51.9m.
Adding further, separate, charges for irrecoverable interest on mortgage
accounts in arrears and repossessions, the total charge for loss provisions
came to Pounds 62.4m (Pounds 101.7m).
The September year-end at Leeds is different from almost all other building
societies.
This means that its full-year results, announced in November, did not
reflect the fall in provisions which have already helped its competitors to
report sharply increased profits for 1993.
Leeds' full-year results for 1992-93 included a 22 per cent rise in pre-tax
profits to Pounds 186.2m, but provisions rose from Pounds 105.2m to Pounds
131.1m.
Yesterday's announcement included increased net interest receivable of
Pounds 231.3m (Pounds 225.3m). In the last full-year interest received rose
from Pounds 342.1m to Pounds 428m.
Administrative expenses in the first half rose to Pounds 108.8m (Pounds
103.5m), much of the rise being attributable to investment in the life
company which is due to become operational in the summer.
The society, whose merger talks with National & Provincial fell through last
autumn, is still looking for a chief executive.
Mr Roger Boyes, finance director, said that in terms of the day-to-day
management of the society the lack of a chief executive was a 'non-issue',
but he admitted that the absence of one for a long time was not a healthy
position.
