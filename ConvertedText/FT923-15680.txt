FT  01 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Lonrho hit by collapse in south African
profits


   By ROLAND RUDD


LONRHO, the international trading group, yesterday published for the first
time a half-year breakdown of turnover and profit by activity and
geographical area which showed a collapse in pre-tax profits from southern
Africa.
Technical problems at South Africa's Western Platinum and a decline in
precious metal prices were responsible for pre-tax profits falling from
Pounds 32m to Pounds 3m. Pre-tax profits from mineral extraction and
refining throughout the group fell from Pounds 39m to Pounds 14m.
Mr Paul Spicer, deputy chairman, said the group was confident the second
half would contain better results because technical problems at Western
Platinum had been solved and production of precious metals would be
increased.
The Americas reported no profit figures as the recession continued to affect
its Princess Hotels. Leisure, which includes hotels in Africa, saw pre-tax
profits decline from Pounds 3m to nil.
Pre-tax profits from east, central and west Africa fell from Pounds 36m to
Pounds 23m, while in Europe profits dropped from Pounds 22m to Pounds 5m.
The UK businesses continued to be affected by the recession as pre-tax
profits declined from Pounds 19m to Pounds 7m. Pre-tax profits from motor
and equipment distribution fell from Pounds 11m to Pounds 6m.
General trade, which includes distributors of electrical goods and aircraft
spares, saw pre-tax profits fall from Pounds 24m to Pounds 9m.
In financial services, pre-tax profits dropped from Pounds 24m to Pounds 4m.
Manufacturing, which includes The Observer newspaper, reported a fall in
pre-tax profits from Pounds 5m to Pounds 3m. Pre-tax profits from
agriculture slipped from Pounds 3m to Pounds 2m.
