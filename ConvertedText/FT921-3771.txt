FT  12 MAR 92 / Election '92: MPs set to blame officials on 'supergun'


   By RALPH ATKINS


GOVERNMENT officials are set to be blamed tomorrow by a Commons committee
for failing to stop the export of parts for the Iraqi 'supergun' project,
Ralph Atkins writes.
The Commons trade and industry committee is rushing through consideration of
a draft report which stops short of blaming ministers for the affair - but
does not explicitly rule out the possibility that intelligence services
deliberately allowed the project to go ahead.
Some MPs on the all-party committee believe the report's conclusions raise
vital constitutional questions about the accountability of the security
forces. However the draft veers towards the 'cock-up' rather than the
conspiracy theory.
The committee will meet today, and again tomorrow if needed, to complete the
report.
