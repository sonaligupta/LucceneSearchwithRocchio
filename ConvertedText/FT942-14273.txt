FT  21 APR 94 / Halifax backs statutory rules in financial services


   By ALISON SMITH


A directly administered system of statutory regulation for financial
services would overcome the 'conflicts of interest' from the industry's
involvement and produce a stable regulatory regime, Halifax building society
told MPs yesterday.
Mr Mike Blackburn, Halifax chief executive, said that the society had not
made up its mind whether to apply to join the Personal Investment Authority,
the new watchdog to protect the private investor.
But the Commons Treasury committee examining financial regulation sharply
questioned how the society could assert it was committed to high standards
when it refused to volunteer to customers details of the commissions paid on
certain products until forced to do so as a regulatory requirement.
Mr Blackburn undertook to write to the MPs with details of some examples of
costs of particular policies, but he and his colleagues said that disclosing
figures which could sensibly be compared across the industry was a complex
matter.
As for the form of regulation, the society said that without a need for
primary legislation the staff carrying out the regulatory functions could be
brought directly under the Treasury. This would cut down the 'multi-tiering'
of the planned system.
Mr Blackburn said Halifax was still considering the possibility of being
regulated directly by the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief
watchdog.
Sir Nicholas Goodison, TSB chairman, told MPs that although the bank had
applied to join the PIA he hoped the balance of its board would be changed,
so that people working in the financial services industry were in a
majority.
