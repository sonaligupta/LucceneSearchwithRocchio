FT  13 APR 94 / UK Company News: Link with Suter brings Danbury back to life


   By SIMON DAVIES


Danbury, the property group which went into receivership just three years
after its USM placing in 1989, is to become the property management arm of
Suter following an injection of properties from the industrial conglomerate.
The announcement comes less than a week after Suter announced a recommended
offer for James Wilkes, the Sheffield-based engineering group.
Danbury - to be renamed Wedderburn Securities - will be 26 per cent-owned by
Suter and plans to manage the conglomerate's vacant and under-utilised
properties.
Mr Jon Pither, deputy chairman of Suter, said his company had up to Pounds
10m in vacant land and properties, which could be sold to Danbury at a later
stage. He added that Suter would be a long-term investor and that he was to
become non-executive chairman.
Danbury's share quote was cancelled last September after its banks had
decided not to forward any more loans to keep it afloat, amid sinking
property prices.
Under a Company Voluntary Arrangement, it is to be freed from all previous
debt obligations by paying Pounds 158,000 to creditors, which were owed a
total of Pounds 10.3m.
It is to place out 5.09m shares and launch an open offer for the same number
at 15p a share. Danbury is paying Pounds 1.5m for Suter's sheltered housing
interests, and a further Pounds 320,000 for an option on a 32 acre site at
Braintree, Essex. It would cost a further Pounds 2.56m to take up the
option. Suter will receive Pounds 700,000 in cash and 7.27m shares.
Mr Stephen Sibley, Danbury's managing director, has acted as consultant for
Suter's planned development of a superstore on a 10 acre site adjoining the
Braintree land.
Danbury will have net assets of only Pounds 2.3m following the transaction.
Trading in the shares is expected to resume on May 9 under Stock Exchange
Rule 535 (2).
