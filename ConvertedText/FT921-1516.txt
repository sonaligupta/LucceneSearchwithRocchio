FT  24 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Order shortfall forces Lincat down


Taxable profits at Lincat Group, the USM-quoted catering equipment maker,
tumbled from Pounds 376,000 to Pounds 106,000 in the six months to December
31. However, the interim dividend is maintained at 1.8p.
Mr Martin Craddock, chairman, said the downturn largely reflected the sharp
fall in orders at Colbrook and Douglas, both of which had been strong
contributors to profits last time. Lincat and Corsair performed well
considering the economic climate.
Turnover slid to Pounds 5.16m (Pounds 5.82m) and operating profits to Pounds
250,000 (Pounds 587,000). Earnings dropped to 1p (3.7p) per share.
