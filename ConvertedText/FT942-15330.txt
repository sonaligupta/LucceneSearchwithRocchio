FT  15 APR 94 / International Company News: Kemira to raise FM2bn to cut
debts

   STOCKHOLM


Kemira, the Finnish chemicals group, yesterday disclosed plans to raise up
to FM2bn (Dollars 362m) through an initial public offering, further
quickening the pace of the government's privatisation programme.
Shares in the fully state-owned group will be offered to international and
domestic institutions and the Finnish public, leaving as much as one-third
of the company in private hands.
Proceeds will be used to reduce the group's FM8bn debt. The company will
also gain a stock market listing.
The offering would be the biggest yet in the government's programme to widen
ownership of state companies. Two other big Finnish industrial groups,
Rautaruukki and Valmet, are also planning large international share issues
as part of the same process.
Kemira aims to launch its offer in the autumn, subject to financial
performance and market conditions. It has been encouraged to make the move
after returning to the black with a FM30m pre-tax profit last year, compared
with a 1992 deficit of FM338m.
Mr Heimo Karinen, chief executive, said: 'Competitiveness is now good within
the entire group. I am confident that Kemira has sustainable competitive
advantages in its chosen markets.'
The company achieved 1993 net sales of FM11.2bn, up 6 per cent on 1992
despite generally difficult trading conditions.
