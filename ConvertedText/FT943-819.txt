FT  27 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow advances ahead of Fed
rates decision

Wall Street
Blue chip stocks forged ahead yesterday afternoon but the technology group
retreated, as investors awaited the outcome of today's Federal Reserve
policy-making session, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 17.49 up at 3,849.24 and the
Standard & Poor's 500 gained 1.17 at 460.84, but the Nasdaq composite
slipped 1.83 to 755.63. NYSE volume came to 272.5m shares.
After a week of volatility, trading settled into a more even tempo
yesterday. The blue chip index meandered within a few points of its opening
level throughout the morning, mirroring a lazy drift by bonds. Few investors
were willing to make big new commitments before it became clear whether the
Fed would decide to lift interest rates immediately.
The session brought a piece of evidence suggesting that the economy was
cooling. The National Association of Realtors said sales of existing
single-family homes fell by 1.8 per cent last month, a little more than
analysts had forecast.
Although the data had little impact on sentiment, the Dow managed to pick up
strength during the afternoon. Two stocks were mostly responsible. The
first, Coca-Cola, added Dollars 1 at Dollars 49 5/8 after announcing that it
was lifting its investment in Russia. Meanwhile, Philip Morris gained
Dollars 1 at Dollars 59 3/8 after signalling its intention of resisting more
stringent restrictions on smoking in New York City.
Walt Disney put on Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 40 1/4 after deciding to quit
talks on buying the NBC television network from General Electric, which was
marked up Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 49 1/4 .
The technology sector showed broad-based weakness. In semiconductors, Micron
Technology shed Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 36 and Texas Instruments dropped
Dollars 3 3/4 , or 5 per cent, to Dollars 67 1/4 . CS First Boston
downgraded both stocks, citing unimpressive demand for dynamic random access
memory, or Dram, computer chips.
On the Nasdaq, Oracle was off Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 42 1/2 but Lotus
Development firmed Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 37 7/8 . The two companies
reached an agreement to integrate their database software products.
In banking, EquiCredit surged Dollars 4 7/8 to Dollars 29 1/2 after Barnett
Banks agreed to acquire the company. But Arbor National Holding plummeted
Dollars 4 1/4 to Dollars 15 3/4 on news of its agreement to merge with
BankAmerica. On the NYSE, Barnett dipped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 43 5/8 and
BankAmerica held at Dollars 46.
Canada
The Toronto composite index declined in light trading as the market looked
to today's meeting of the US Federal Reserve for any move on interest rates.
The index closed 26.12 off at 4,341.42 as losing issues led rises by 471 to
284. Volume was 41.2m shares.
Brazil
Equities in Sao Paulo fell 3.4 per cent in heavy trading amid concern over a
report quoting presidential candidate Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso as saying
that he saw possible government action to slow the inflow of foreign money
into Brazil as positive. The Bovespa index ended 1,881 down at 52,651.
Turnover amounted to RDollars 328.7m (Dollars 381.3m).
