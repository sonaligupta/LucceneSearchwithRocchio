FT  16 NOV 93 / Organic farmers warn on funding


   By ALISON MAITLAND


ORGANIC FARMERS could become 'an endangered species' unless the government
provides more financial support for the sector, Mrs Gillian Shephard,
agriculture minister, was told yesterday.
Representatives of the Soil Association, which registers organic producers,
met Mrs Shephard to complain about the proposed organic aid scheme which
will pay Pounds 1.5m a year to farmers who convert to organic methods but
will do nothing to help existing organic farmers.
Some organic farmers were reverting to conventional practices or setting
aside because it brought greater financial rewards, they said.
The association said: 'The growing UK market for organic food will be
supplied by subsidised organic farmers in Holland, Germany and Denmark.'
Demand for organic produce is increasing although the recession has held
back the pace of growth. A recent survey by Mintel, the consumer research
analysts, said sales of organic foods in the UK had increased nearly
fivefold since 1988 to about Pounds 105.1m this year.
Under the government's proposals announced in August, English producers
converting to organic methods will initially receive Pounds 70 a hectare,
falling to Pounds 25 a hectare in the last year of the five-year scheme.
That compares with proposed payments in Germany of about Pounds 150 a
hectare for existing producers and Pounds 200 for new entrants, the
association said.
Mr Francis Blake, association secretary, said: 'If we want a decent
incentive for farmers to go organic and stay organic, that's the sort of
figure that's needed at the moment.'
The ministry said after the meeting that the government felt it best to use
available resources to encourage conversion, although it would keep under
review the idea of help for existing farmers.
