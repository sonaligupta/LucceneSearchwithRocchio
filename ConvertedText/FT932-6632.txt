FT  27 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Perpetual surges to Pounds 5.09m


SHARES OF Perpetual, the unit trust and portfolio management organisation,
rose 52p to 453p yesterday on news of a surge in profits from Pounds 2.18m
to Pounds 5.09m pre-tax for the six months to end-March.
Turnover of Pounds 325.83m compared with Pounds 121.33m previously and basic
earnings per share worked through at 13.28p (6.14p), or 12.05p fully
diluted. Because of changes in the Budget payment of the 1.8p (1.2p) interim
dividend was brought forward to April.
Mr Martyn Arbib, chairman, believed that a further improvement in profits
could be achieved in the second half and said it should be possible to
declare a 'substantial increase' in the final dividend - last year's final
was 3.6p.
He pointed out that funds under management increased over the opening six
months from Pounds 846m to Pounds 1.34bn boosted by an influx of some Pounds
260m of net new money. The funds have subsequently increased to about Pounds
1.5bn.
Turnover and pre-tax profits for the year to September 30 1992 totalled
Pounds 246.64m and Pounds 4.79m.
