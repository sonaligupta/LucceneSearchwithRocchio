FT  26 MAY 93 / International Company News: East Asian demand limits Yamaha
Motor downturn


   By ROBERT THOMSON


YAMAHA Motor, the motorcycle maker, unveiled a 33.7 per cent fall to Y4.97bn
(Dollars 45m) in pre-tax profit for the year to March, but would have
reported a far larger drop without a surge in demand from China and other
east Asian countries.
Sales for the year were 1.9 per cent lower at Y471.5bn, mainly due to a 11.2
per cent fall in domestic motorcycle sales. Motorcycle exports were 4.6 per
cent higher, but profits on those sales were eroded by the appreciation of
the yen during the year.
Exports accounted for 62.7 per cent of total sales, including those of
marine craft, up from 58.8 per cent in the previous period, and a sign of
the Yamaha's vulnerability to fluctuations in the yen's value.
The company's car engine business is still struggling, as sales during the
year fell to Y35.9bn from Y39.7bn, while sales of marine craft were down
10.6 per cent to Y96.5bn.
Yamaha forecast a 4 per cent rise in sales this year to Y490bn, as it
expects domestic sales to recover during the period, but it still forecast
another 9.5 per cent decrease in pre-tax profit.
