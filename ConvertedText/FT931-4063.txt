FT  12 MAR 93 / UK Company News: ADT back in the black with Dollars 109m


   By RICHARD GOURLAY


ADT, the US-based security and auctions business, yesterday reported a
Dollars 109.1m (Pounds 76.8m) net income in 1992, reporting for the first
time under US GAAP.
The figure compared with a loss in 1991 of Dollars 514.3m, struck after
Dollars 564.4m of 'unusual items', related to items like the refocusing of
the business on the two core businesses and the write-off of goodwill on the
acquisition of Britannia Security.
Earnings were 80 cents but would have been in line with market expectations
of Dollars 1.06 had the results been reported as previously under UK GAAP.
ADT said it was changing to US GAAP as most of the common shareholders were
now in North America. The company said it expected to make announcements
regarding a refinancing during the second quarter of the year.
Most of ADT's syndicated bank debt falls due in the second half of 1994 and
the company expects its convertible redeemable preference shares will be
presented for redemption during the same period.
Mr Michael Ashcroft, chairman and chief executive, said electronic security
and auctions businesses had both performed up to expectations.
Auctions sales rose 3.6 per cent to Dollars 342.8m, but profits fell from
Dollars 71.8m to Dollars 68.2m. Market conditions remained difficult in the
US, where ADT is the second largest vehicle auctioneer, and in the UK, where
it is the biggest. Sales in electronic services rose 2.3 per cent, but
profits were 10 per cent higher at Dollars 141m.
