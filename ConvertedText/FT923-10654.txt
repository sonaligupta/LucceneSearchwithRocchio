FT  29 JUL 92 / New TUC adviser fuels speculation


   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor


MR CHARLES CLARKE, who for nearly 10 years was chief of staff and leading
'fixer' to Mr Neil Kinnock, the former Labour leader, is taking up a senior
advisory post at the Trades Union Congress.
The appointment has renewed speculation that Mr Norman Willis, the TUC
general secretary, will announce his intention to step down at this year's
TUC congress.
TUC officials have pointed out that Mr Clarke will be working for Mr John
Monks, Mr Willis's deputy, who is now in effect running the organisation.
Nominally he has been appointed, on a short-term contract, to work on
'campaigns and communications' but in practice he will be writing a
consultancy report on the rationalisation of the TUC, which will be a
leading theme of this year's congress.
Mr Willis has at least another three years in office and for that period
remains president of the European TUC, but leaders of the four main TUC
unions are expressing increasingly open frustration at his management style.
At the last meeting of the finance and general purposes committee, Mr Willis
was repeatedly interrupted or ignored by union leaders.
Some TUC officials believe that Mr Willis, who is at present recovering from
an operation, will tell congress that for health reasons he cannot continue
to run the TUC but will see out his period in office at the ETUC.
If Mr Clarke were to stay at the TUC it would not necessarily signify a
reassertion of unions links with Labour, as he is not popular in the office
of Mr John Smith, the new Labour leader.
