FT  27 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Parent power


Who should run Britain's state schools, appoint the teachers and decide
their priorities? The answer, the government says, is the school governors,
the majority of whom are parents. The right to hire and fire teachers - the
head teacher, in particular - was taken away from local authorities to stop
them interfering in the day-to-day working of schools.
Now this apparently sensible reform has been cast into doubt by events at
Kingsmead School in Hackney, east London. Ms Jane Brown, the head, last week
achieved instant notoriety by refusing cheap tickets for her children to see
the ballet Romeo and Juliet. She described Shakespeare's plot as 'blatantly
heterosexual', calling down a torrent of media interest and abuse for her
political correctness. This abated somewhat after she apologised for her
decision. But it then emerged that Ms Brown shares a house with a woman who
chaired the school governors at the time of her appointment.
Hackney Borough Council, anxious to improve the poor image of its education
service, launched an immediate inquiry into her appointment. To the
council's horror, the governors have refused to suspend her during the
inquiry. In this, they apparently have the backing of the parents: even
those who condemn her refusal of the tickets say that she has been a good
head. Parents have shown a healthy scepticism for Hackney's desire for a
quick end to the affair. More to the point, they seem well able to separate
Ms Brown's private life from her professional performance.
This has led to predictable calls for Mr John Patten, the education
secretary, to intervene and remove Ms Brown as head. He can do this under
powers left over from the 1944 Education Act. Mr Patten would be wise to
ignore such calls, however, despite the prospect of popular acclaim for so
doing. If parent power is to mean anything, the governors' decision - made
with clear parental backing - must not be second-guessed from Whitehall.
