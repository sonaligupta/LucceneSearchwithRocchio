FT  19 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Efficiency pays for wage deal


   From Mr DENNIS BATTLE


Sir, One small but important point on David Goodhart's article on our pay
deal ('Customs staff given performance pay targets', April 18). The deal
will not increase the bill by 2.6 per cent. In line with the chancellor of
the exchequer's policy, our pay bill is frozen at its 1993-1994 level, and
the cost of the 2.6 per cent deal will be funded through efficiency savings.
