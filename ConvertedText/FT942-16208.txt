FT  12 APR 94 / Early move promised on coal sell-off


   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent


The government will invite 'expressions of interest' in the sale of British
Coal in the very near future, Lord Strathclyde, trade and industry minister,
told the Lords yesterday.
Peers gave a second reading to the coal industry bill, the privatisation
measure already approved by the Commons.
Lord Strathclyde said that private-sector management would provide fresh
ideas and there would be opportunities for British Coal employees to make
proposals for taking over the running of the industry.
Lord Morris of Castle Morris, from the Labour front bench, was joined by
other opposition peers in advocating an expanded role for the proposed Coal
Authority. They suggested it should have wider responsibilities for dealing
with subsidence as well as for licensing coal mining operations and granting
interests in coal.
Lord Ezra, the Liberal Democrat peer and a former chairman of the National
Coal Board, said there must be some doubt over the effect of the
fragmentation of the industry under privatisation.
Mr John Redwood, the Welsh secretary, yesterday ruled out government help
for Tower colliery, British Coal's last deep mine in south Wales. He made
clear he had no plans to intervene to save the mine, which is due to shut at
the end of the week with the loss of nearly 300 jobs.
