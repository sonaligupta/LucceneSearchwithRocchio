Saga Petroleum, Norway's largest independent oil producer, will today sign a
seven-year Dollars 1.26bn revolving credit facility in London. It will cover
the group's borrowing requirements until 2000, and allow it to expand
through acquisitions in Norway and abroad.
The facility, initially for Dollars 850m, was over-subscribed by Dollars
410m and is priced at Libor plus 0.3 per cent. It replaces a Dollars 750m
loan which had a shorter duration and stiffer terms.
The loan's arrangers include ABN Amro Bank, Barclays Syndications and
Deutsche Bank London, with Norwegian co-arrangers Christiania Bank and Den
norske Bank.
Saga said the loan covers existing debt of NKr6bn (Dollars 873.5m).
The company is planning a listing on the New York Stock Exchange in the
spring of 1995, and plans to acquire reserves or companies both at home and
abroad.
Saga has operational responsibility for the North Sea Snorre field, which
produces 210,000 barrels a day. Also, in June, the group's North Sea Tordis
field was brought on stream and currently produces 72,000 barrels a day.
