FT  30 NOV 94 / UK Company News: MY rights for Pounds 22m purchase - Pounds
24m cash call will fund pharmaceuticals packaging expansion


   By SIMON DAVIES


MY Holdings, the acquisitive packaging group, yesterday announced the Pounds
22.1m purchase of PropharmaPak, a manufacturer of cartons for the
pharmaceuticals industry.
The deal is to be funded by a Pounds 24m rights issue which will increase
MY's market value by more than 50 per cent.
MY spent Pounds 24m on four acquisitions last year, and made no secret of
its desire to increase further its market share in niche sectors within the
packaging industry.
It is offering 47m new shares at 53p, on an 8-for-15 basis. This represents
only a small discount to yesterday's 55p closing share price. Malbak, the
South African conglomerate which owns 65 per cent of MY has agreed to take
up 95.6 per cent of its rights.
About 70 per cent of PropharmaPak's sales are to the pharmaceuticals
industry and the company has about a 12 per cent market share. MY already
accounted for 6 per cent of the market, but there is only one overlapping
customer between the two groups.
Mr John Monks, chief executive, said the takeover would provide improved
purchasing power, a key factor as packaging materials account for almost
half of costs. It would also benefit from improved capacity utilisation and
pooling funding for technological improvements.
Following the acquisition, about 40 per cent of MY's revenues will come from
the food and beverage industry, and 25 per cent from healthcare and
cosmetics. Four years ago it had minimal sales to the food sector and no
healthcare sales.
PropharmaPak made operating profits of Pounds 2.8m in 1993, aided by some
one-off items, on turnover of Pounds 10.1m. MY is paying a maximum Pounds
22.1m (on a debt-free basis), but Pounds 800,000 of this will be held in
escrow, to be released if the company makes operating profits of Pounds
2.8m. MY said the purchase price represented less than 12 times after-tax
earnings.
Its net debt at the August 27 year-end was Pounds 2.9m, gearing of 16.3 per
cent.
The purchase is expected to have a neutral impact on earnings per share this
year.
