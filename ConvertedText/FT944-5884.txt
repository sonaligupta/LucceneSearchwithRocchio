FT  01 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Organic growth boosts Quadramatic 63% to
Pounds 7.5m


   By PETER PEARSE


Shares in Quadramatic climbed 17p to 188p yesterday as the acquisitive
specialist engineer announced a 63 per cent pre-tax profits increase from
Pounds 4.6m to Pounds 7.5m in the 12 months to September 30, its first full
year as a quoted company.
The flotation price was 123p.
Mr Tony Gartland, chairman, stressed that there had been organic growth
within the group - including within the acquired companies since purchase -
of 17 per cent. For example, the instruments division - including Quota for
11 months since its Pounds 11.25m acquisition and KM Comark bought for
Pounds 3.8m in June 1994 - lifted operating profits by 36 per cent to Pounds
2.4m. The operating margin was 25.2 per cent.
Operating profits in the core coin handling division rose 20 per cent to
Pounds 4.9m on turnover down 1 per cent to Pounds 21.1m. The margin rose one
percentage point to 20.1 per cent. Mr Gartland said the group had knocked
out Dollars 1m of low-margin turnover in the division and that chasing
high-margin profits, not sales was the priority.
In specialist moulded products, profits grew to Pounds 790,000 (Pounds
680,000) on turnover up 6 per cent at Pounds 6.6m. Barely a week ago, the
group announced the acquisition of Kestrel Injection Moulders for an initial
Pounds 4.4m and up to Pounds 6.6m in total.
On the acquisitions front Mr Gartland said he wanted to expand the
temperature measuring and plastic moulding sides. Private companies were the
likeliest targets and he said he was prepared to 'pay a lot for goodwill' -
topping management buy-out offers - acknowledging that in tangible terms
this might make the balance sheet 'a bit thin'.
Group turnover rose to Pounds 37m (Pounds 27.4m) including Pounds 9.36m from
Quota and Comark. Some 64 (55) per cent of the group total is derived from
outside the UK and, notwithstanding the UK-bound Kestrel, is expected to
rise. Operating profits were Pounds 7.5m. A final dividend of 4p is a 57 per
cent increase on the pro forma 2.55p and makes a total for the year of 6.5p,
twice covered by basic earnings per share of 13p (9.8p).
