FT  23 NOV 92 / Creditors shake Olympia & York to its foundations: The
property developer is shrinking almost to insignificance


   By BERNARD SIMON


Some traditions at Olympia & York's elegant head office on the 28th floor of
Toronto's Exchange Tower have been maintained since the world's biggest
property developer filed for bankruptcy protection seven months ago.
A small kitchen still prepares lunch for Paul and Albert Reichmann, O&Y's
founders, and a waitress still delivers the meal to their offices on a
silver tray.
But much else has changed. O&Y, known in its heyday as an aggressive,
family-run developer always on the lookout for the next pioneering deal, is
rapidly shrinking to an inconspicuous property manager controlled by
penny-pinching creditors.
Creditors' influence is pervasive, from the welter of information which has
been prised out of the once-secretive Reichmanns, to the absence of the
fresh flowers which used to adorn the receptionist's desk at head office.
The full extent of creditors' power became clear last week when O&Y agreed
to what amounts to an orderly liquidation of some of its most prized assets.
Responding to a groundswell of protest against its latest debt-restructuring
plan, the company asked creditors to postpone of a series of meetings due to
start on November 25.
Thirty-four creditor groups with claims totalling CDollars 8.6bn (Pounds
4.5bn) were due to vote on the restructuring proposals at the meetings.
But it was clear by early last week that several key groups, notably those
with well-secured claims against specific O&Y buildings, would reject the
plan outright.
The creditors agreed to put off the meetings until mid-January, but only on
condition that if they then turn down any revised proposals O&Y comes up
with, they will be free to seize their collateral.
Some groups of lenders have already begun interviewing new managers to take
over the maintenance and letting of buildings from O&Y. Among those likely
to be seized in coming months are the 72-storey First Canadian Place in the
heart of Toronto's financial district, and the nearby 68-storey Scotia
Plaza.
Under the next restructuring plan, to be filed by December 15, the
Reichmanns are expected to cede control of the company's equity to its
unsecured and under-secured creditors.
These creditors' hopes of getting their money back rest on an upturn in the
North American commercial property market, especially in New York and
Toronto, and an improvement in the fortunes of O&Y's key non-property
investments, newsprint maker Abitibi-Price and Gulf Canada Resources.
The past seven months have been humiliating for the Reichmanns. They have
lost the bulk of their fortune and their reputation as far-sighted
businessmen has taken a battering.
O&Y in its heyday had an image of a prudently-managed company whose owners
combined vision and flair, and made a point of keeping their promises.
But the light shone on to O&Y since May has revealed something different: a
disorganised tangle of companies with a highly centralised management.
As a result, creditors' attitudes towards the Reichmanns have hardened. Much
effort over the past seven months has gone into tracking down the family's
assets and making sure that they pay as much as possible towards the costs
of keeping O&Y afloat.
As one creditor's lawyer put it a few months ago: 'We don't want their
houses, but we want just about everything else.'
The disillusionment of O&Y's lenders has also cast a pall over the rest of
the North American property finance market. Investors now insist on tighter
protection in loan covenants, such as channelling rents to a trustee who
would be responsible for debt-service payments.
The Reichmanns' worth now consists largely of a 20 per cent equity stake in
their debt-burdened US properties, some smallish privately-held Canadian
buildings and their original Toronto floor-coverings business.
Paul and Albert Reichmann still come into the office on most days. Mr David
Brown, O&Y's chief legal adviser, says: 'We're bouncing ideas off them all
the time, almost on a daily basis.'
O&Y is now run however, by Mr Gerald Greenwald, the former Chrysler
vice-chairman hired last April as president. Mr Steve Miller, another
ex-Chrysler man who is now a partner at the New York investment bank James D
Wolfensohn, spearheads the restructuring negotiations.
O&Y's executives and advisers may bounce ideas off the Reichmanns. But the
orders these days come from the creditors.
