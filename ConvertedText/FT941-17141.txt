FT  06 JAN 94 / Businesses 'ignoring secretarial potential


   By RICHARD DONKIN


'Two out of three secretaries say they would rather be doing another job and
many believe their skills and qualifications are being wasted by companies
which ignore their potential, a report says today, Richard Donkin writes.
Type Cast, the report of a survey of 540 secretaries and 396 managers
published today by the Industrial Society, concludes that work
dissatisfaction among secretaries is rife.
The society described secretaries and administrative staff as 'the most
undervalued, under-utilised and under-developed section of the 90s
workforce'. Nearly half the secretaries questioned wanted management
careers. One said: 'I watch my manager doing the job and I'm sure I could do
it just as well, if not better.'
But companies were not responding to secretaries' hopes of career
progression. The report says: 'Secretaries are rarely given specific
training and development plans and the assumption organisations often make
is that they don't need development and are happy to remain secretaries.'
