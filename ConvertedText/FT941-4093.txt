FT  12 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Euro Disney deal 'nearer' - At a
glance


Beleaguered Euro Disney this week edged closer to a Pounds 1.3bn rescue
deal. The European leisure group and Walt Disney, its US parent, are
understood to have mapped out a restructuring plan with Euro Disney's banks.
The hope is that an outline rescue can be agreed before the March 31
deadline imposed by Disney for continuing to support Euro Disney. The
American company is understood to be willing to extend its support beyond
the deadline if the banks agree in principle to the rescue package.
