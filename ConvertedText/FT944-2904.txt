FT  15 DEC 94 / International Company News: Fokker hit by warning on
reduction in deficit

Shares in Fokker, the Dutch aircraft maker controlled by Deutsche Aerospace
(Dasa) of Germany, tumbled more than 15 per cent yesterday after it said it
would make virtually no progress in cutting losses this year.
The profit forecast, which ran counter to a prediction in August that losses
would narrow in 1994, sent Fokker's shares tumbling to close at Fl 12.30
compared with Fl 14.50 on Tuesday.
Fokker blamed the revised outlook on the steep drop in the dollar in the
second half of 1994 and a further decline in the dollar-denominated selling
price of new aircraft. It expects its losses in 1994 to be about equal to
the record Fl 460m (Dollars 261m) net loss posted in 1993.
The company said it would continue to aim at returning to profitability in
1996, in line with its existing target. But to achieve this, it said it
would need to reduce its cost base further, holding out the possibility of
additional job losses.
A decision on what measures were needed to pare costs is expected to be
taken in the first quarter of 1995.
Dasa, which acquired a 51 per cent stake in Fokker in 1993, recently
injected Fl 600m into the Dutch company to shore up its balance sheet. The
Dutch government also lent indirect support by approving a Fl 400m sale and
lease-back of Fokker's technology to Rabobank, the Dutch co-operative bank.
Fokker, which has been majority-owned by Dasa since early 1993, has carried
out three rounds of restructuring in the past three years. These have
reduced the workforce to fewer than 10,000 people from more than 13,000 in
1990.
The company said the aviation market's malaise was more a problem of falling
prices than stagnant orders. Most of Fokker's costs are incurred in
guilders, one of the strongest European currencies, while its aircraft are
sold in dollars.
