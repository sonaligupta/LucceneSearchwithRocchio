FT  12 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Scottish Value Trust asset value rises


Scottish Value Trust, which has the bulk of its investments in the
investment trust sector, said that in the year to September 30 net asset
value per share had risen from 48.8p to 60.1p and that since then it had
risen further to 65.84p at the end of October.
The company said good progress had been made in investing the proceeds of
the Pounds 14m placing and open offer in September.
The company, formerly Bremner, has changed its year end, so comparisons were
not possible.
Available revenue for the period came to Pounds 426,000. In the six months
to September 30 1991 available revenue came to Pounds 70,000. Earnings per
share came to 1.78p, against 0.48p.
A dividend of 1.8p has already been paid for the year.
