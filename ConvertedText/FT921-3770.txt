THE Finance Bill which the Commons will pass through all its stages tomorrow
will contain 11 clauses, Mr Francis Maude, financial secretary to the
Treasury, announced last night.
The income tax provisions, which must be renewed before May 5 each year,
will include the new 20 per cent lower rate band for the first Pounds 2,000
of taxable income.
Other clauses will embody the changes in excise duties which took effect
from six o'clock on Tuesday.
