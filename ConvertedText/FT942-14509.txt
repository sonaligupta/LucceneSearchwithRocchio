FT  20 APR 94 / Management: MCA tips growth


   By TIM DICKSON


The UK's top management consultancies have a recruitment headache, according
to the body that represents them.
Commenting on the latest quarterly survey of business trends conducted by
the Management Consultancies Association, executive director Brian O'Rorke
says its members are having difficulty attracting 'individuals of the right
calibre'.
He adds: 'With fee rates tight consultancies are finding it difficult to
persuade suitably qualified managers to leave their existing employment.'
O'Rorke's warning - which he says could affect the ability of consultancies
to react to client demands - comes on top of encouraging figures from the
MCA, whose 34 members collectively account for more than 50 per cent of
fee-earning management consultancy work in the UK. Earnings in the first
quarter of 1994 were 3.8 per cent higher at Pounds 235m than in the previous
three months. It is the sixth quarter running that has shown growth and the
second in succession marked by a significant increase.
'The trend in order books is very pleasing,' says MCA president Keith
Burgess. 'I continue to expect growth in the consultancy industry to
outstrip growth in GDP, which is forecast at 2.5 per cent year-on-year in
coming years.'
While MCA members are cautious of short-term growth prospects, nearly 80 per
cent expect increased volumes of new orders during the next six months. They
also expect increased activity in most industry sectors during this period,
with financial services offering the best prospects.
Work in the construction/property, manufacturing and overseas sectors is
described as 'ponderous', but most sectors are expected to experience a
'slight improvement'. Retailing is also singled out and the MCA says 'some
major re-engineering projects are under way'.
