FT  29 APR 94 / UK Company News: Monarch delay over switch to Toronto


   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent


Shares in Monarch Resources fell 18p to 283p early yesterday after the
company, which has gold mining and exploration activities in Venezuela,
revealed that it had run into problems with the timing of its plan to switch
its quotation from London to the Toronto stock exchange.
Monarch said the scheme was being delayed by two to four weeks to give time
for gold market conditions to stabilise. Since it announced the plan on
March 29, the price of gold bullion has fallen by 4 per cent, from Dollars
390 to Dollars 374 a troy ounce and gold company share prices in Toronto
have fallen by between 15 and 20 per cent.
The company previously said it was disillusioned by London investors' lack
of interest in smaller mining companies. It planned to raise Dollars 30m
(Pounds 20.5m), principally from Canadian investors, so that it could apply
for a listing in Toronto where investors had a better understanding of gold
stocks.
Present shareholders would be able to take part via an open offer for up to
Pounds 7m. At a special meeting which approved these arrangements yesterday,
it was also announced that the closing date for the shareholder offer had
been extended from May 4 to May 16.
After the market had time to absorb the full implications, Monarch's share
price recovered slightly to 290p.
