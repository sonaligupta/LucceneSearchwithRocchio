FT  20 NOV 92 / International Company News: Cheaper funding lifts Orix


   By CHARLES LEADBEATER


ORIX, the leading Japanese leasing company, reported a 6.4 per cent increase
in net income to Y10.02bn (Dollars 80.5m), largely a reflection of tighter
credit screening of clients to reduce risks of bad debts and cheaper funding
as a result of cuts in Japan's official discount rate, writes Charles
Leadbeater.
The Orix group is one of Japan's top non-banks, which are less tightly
regulated than the banking sector.
The non-banks have been hit by a rising tide of non-performing loans as a
result of the sharp fall in the real estate market over the past two years.
The group's revenues were about 15 per cent down at Y193bn for the six
months to end-September.
