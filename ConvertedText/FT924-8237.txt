FT  12 NOV 92 / International Company News: Bank Austria awarded Russian
branch licence


   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor


BANK Austria has become the first non-Russian bank to receive a licence to
operate a branch in Russia.
To date, foreign banks have only been allowed to operate through
representative offices. As a result, they have been unable to open accounts
for Russian companies or Russian banks.
Mr Michael Franz, who will be general manager of the Moscow branch, said
yesterday that Bank Austria had been planning to open the branch for three
years. The Central Bank of Moscow has been considering Bank Austria's
application for the past nine months.
With a staff of 16, the branch will initially concentrate on providing
foreign exchange and payment services to local banks and up to 25 Russian
companies with hard currency earnings. It will also provide a range of
banking services to western companies with interests in Russia.
