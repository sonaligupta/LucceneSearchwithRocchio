FT  03 SEP 93 / UK Company News: L&M still in restructuring talks with banks


London & Metropolitan, the debt-laden property company, said yesterday that
talks with its bankers regarding a substantial financial restructuring were
taking longer than previously anticipated.
The company announced in July that it had begun talks aimed at securing
agreement on its second restructuring in three years. These were expected to
be finalised by the end of August.
Directors said yesterday that the 'talks were proceeding well' and they
expected the negotiations to be satisfactorily concluded. L&M will be
sending its 1992 financial statements and a circular to shareholders by the
end of this month.
The company has been struggling since incurring a Pounds 100m loss in 1990,
mainly reflecting provisions against falling property values.
The company said in July that the latest talks were necessitated by the
increase in negative net worth from Pounds 44m to Pounds 120m and because
bank loans and working capital facilities had expired at the end of June.
