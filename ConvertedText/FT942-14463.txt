FT  20 APR 94 / International Company News: Christian Salvesen makes FFr57m
frozen food buy


   By ANDREW BOLGER


Christian Salvesen, the international distribution, specialist hire and food
services group, has expanded its French distribution business in a deal
worth FFr56.5m (Pounds 6.5m).
The Edinburgh-based group is paying FFr36.5m for the assets of the Gel
Service group, which specialise in frozen food distribution, and is also
assuming debt of FFr20m.
Gel was founded more than 30 years ago and operates from two sites close to
Lille and Lyon, distributing frozen food for retailers and caterers.
Salvesen will inherit the existing management and 160 employees.
Mr Chris Masters, chief executive, said: 'This acquisition forms part of our
strategy of actively growing our international distribution business. Added
to our existing facilities in France, Gel Service will allow us to offer a
national network of multi-user sites and services to existing and potential
customers.'
