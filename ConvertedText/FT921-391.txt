FT  30 MAR 92 / World News in Brief: Levy says he is quitting as Israeli
foreign minister


Israeli foreign minister David Levy said he was resigning from the
government, revealing a deep rift in the ruling Likud party just three
months before a June 23 national election.
Commentators had predicted Levy would announce he was quitting Likud but he
said, in a speech broadcast on radio, that the party was his home and he
could not leave it.
