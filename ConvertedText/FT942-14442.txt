FT  20 APR 94 / UK Company News: Gartmore chairman receives Pounds 945,000 -
Executive Pay


   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent


Mr Paul Myners, chairman of Gartmore, the fund management company, received
a total of Pounds 945,000 in 1993, about half of which represented loyalty
payments to senior staff promised when Banque Indosuez bought the company in
1989.
Last November, Banque Indosuez sold a 25 per cent stake in the company in a
public flotation. The staff retention scheme, which paid Mr Myners Pounds
425,000 in 1992 has since expired and been replaced with an alternative.
Gartmore's first annual report to shareholders shows Mr Myners' 1993 basic
salary as Pounds 241,000, against Pounds 228,000. He also received a
performance-related bonus of Pounds 205,000 last year, up from Pounds
98,000.
In 1993, Gartmore reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 24.6m, against a loss
of Pounds 2.1m in 1992, reflecting non-recurring items. Assets under
management rose from Pounds 12.8bn to Pounds 21bn in 1993.
