   LONDON


ABB, the electrical engineering multinational, has signed a co-operation
agreement with Velnii and Nevz, two Russian rail equipment suppliers, to
design and build a prototype electric locomotive equipped with ABB power
electronics. After development of the prototype, a joint venture is expected
for volume production of the locomotive, which ABB said could play a key
part in the planned modernisation of the Russian rail system. Velnii and
Nevz are part of the Novocherkassk industrial group, based in the city of
the same name about 700 miles south-east of Moscow.
