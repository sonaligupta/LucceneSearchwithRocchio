FT  29 JUN 93 / International Company News: Dutch ministry gives details of
PTT sell-off

   AMSTERDAM


THE DUTCH finance ministry yesterday said that the previously-announced
privatisation of a 'majority' stake in Koninklijke PTT Nederland, the
state-owned body responsible for responsible for post and telecommunications
networks, would be of around two-thirds of the shares, in three or four
tranches, Reuter reports from Amsterdam.
The ministry said the state would retain a one-third holding, and a 'golden
share' with special powers. These include the right to issue preference
shares in the event of a hostile stake or takeover bid.
As expected, the first tranche is to be offered some time in the first half
of 1994.
'It has not been decided exactly when the first tranche will be offered, but
we have been saying some time in the first half of 1994. It depends on how
good the market is,' a ministry spokesman said.
The advisers to the sale are expected to be chosen this week, although PTT
has said that US brokerage Goldman Sachs is to be lead adviser.
