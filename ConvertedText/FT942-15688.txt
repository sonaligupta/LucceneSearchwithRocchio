FT  14 APR 94 / British Coal makes new offer to Tower miners


   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM


British Coal last night made a new offer to miners at the Tower colliery,
the last deep mine, in South Wales to continue working at reduced wages with
higher production targets. The men are due to consider the offer at a mass
meeting today, Roland Adburgham writes.
This emerged after it was announced that an extra Pounds 10.8m is to be
spent in Cynon Valley, Mid Glamorgan, to counter the impact of the
colliery's closure.
Miners voted last Saturday to reject British Coal's redundancy terms and
instead to seek a formal review of the closure. The mine's shutdown is
threatened for tomorrow with the loss of 200 jobs.
The Welsh Development Agency is allocating the extra money to the Cynon
Valley joint venture, a regeneration partnership with the borough council
and Mid Glamorgan County Council.
The funding is an increase of 63 per cent on the WDA's planned expenditure
in the valley over the next two years. It is intended to accelerate job
creation.
The joint venture said yesterday that its priority was to encourage
companies to relocate to the valley.
A second fund would help local businesses to expand and develop. Existing
programmes will be speeded up, especially improvements to the valley's road
communications; and a skills training programme will be targeted at
unemployed young people.
Meanwhile, it emerged that miners at Tower may try to run it privately.
