FT  06 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Royal Dutch/Shell lifted by oil side


   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor


ROYAL DUTCH/SHELL raised profits by 15 per cent in the first half of the
year as improvements in its oil business more than offset persistent losses
in chemicals.
However, the result was below market expectations and the shares slipped 9
1/2 p to 633p.
The multinational oil group earned Pounds 1.59bn, up from Pounds 1.38bn, on
a replacement cost basis which removes gains and losses from holdings stocks
of oil. This included a 20 per cent increase in second quarter profits from
Pounds 516m to Pounds 619m.
But that quarter included Pounds 183m of restructuring charges, of which
Pounds 112m was in chemicals for redundancy and write-downs. The size of
these charges was the main reason for market disappointment with the result.
Profits from exploration and production improved by 22 per cent in the first
half, from Pounds 813m to Pounds 992m. This included a much stronger
contribution from the US where Shell Oil was making progress in reducing
costs, and where gas prices had recently risen.
The manufacturing, marine and marketing operations also produced higher
profits, ahead 35 per cent at Pounds 892m (Pounds 663m). Although refinery
intake was little changed, sales of oil products were up 5 per cent. Again,
much of the improvement came from better cost control in the US. Elsewhere,
there were Pounds 71m of restructuring charges.
But the effect of these improvements was dampened by Pounds 173m of losses
in the chemicals business, the bulk of which - Pounds 151m - was incurred in
the second quarter. Petrochemical markets remained depressed with only
limited signs of recovery, Shell said, and volumes were affected by
maintenance shutdowns at principal plants.
Sterling's strength against other European currencies and the dollar over
the second quarter resulted in Pounds 141m of currency losses over that
period, exceeding the Pounds 102m losses incurred in the same period of
1992.
The interim dividends for Royal Dutch and Shell Transport, which account for
60 and 40 per cent of the group's profit respectively, will be announced on
September 9.
