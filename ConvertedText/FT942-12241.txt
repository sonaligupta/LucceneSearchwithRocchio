FT  30 APR 94 / UK Company News: Richards ahead but dividend cut


Richards Group, the engineering concern, raised pre-tax profits from Pounds
53,000 to Pounds 85,000 in 1993.
Earnings per share grew from 1.03p to 1.42p, but a recommended final
dividend of 1.25p makes a reduced total for the year of 2.25p (4.4p).
Turnover rose from Pounds 11.3m to Pounds 12.8m, although the company said
markets remained 'very testing'. Order intake for the first quarter was
higher than the same period of 1993.
