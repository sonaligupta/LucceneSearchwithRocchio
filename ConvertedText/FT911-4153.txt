FT  20 APR 91 / Recession seen as deep and long in Sweden

SWEDEN'S recession will continue through next year and the country will have
the worst-performing economy in western Europe, according to a gloomy
forecast published yesterday by the Federation of Swedish Industries.
The report, before Sweden's spring budget next Tuesday, suggests the country
will suffer a second consecutive year with a zero growth rate. It suggests
the fall in gross national product for 1991 will be 1.5 per cent and, for
1992, a further 0.5 per cent. No other western economy is expected to have a
zero growth rate next year or a fall in industrial production.
It also predicts a steep rise in unemployment, from an average 4 per cent
this year to 5 per cent, as well as plummeting industrial investment, a
decline in industrial production and a balance of payments deficit worsening
from SKr44.8bn (Pounds 4.16bn) in 1991 to SKr55.2bn next year, despite an
improved visible trade balance.
The federation represents many of Sweden's private sector employers. It is
taking a more pessimistic view of the immediate outlook than the finance
ministry, blaming structural factors, notably the inability of the
wage-bargaining system to make an effective use of labour resources.
