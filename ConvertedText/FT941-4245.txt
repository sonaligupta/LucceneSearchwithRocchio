FT  11 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading


   By JOEL KIBAZO


An already fragile London derivatives sector once again came under pressure
late in the session on the back of a retreat in US bonds and early falls on
Wall Street, writes Joel Kibazo.
In stock index futures on the Liffe, the March contract on the FT-SE 100
ended at 3,218, down 19 from its previous close and around 12 points below
its estimated fair value premium to cash of about minus 8.
Sporadic buying of March was seen earlier in the session which sent the
contract to the day's peak of 3,262. But buying interest had faded by
lunchtime, with US houses reported to be leading the market lower
The afternoon slide in bonds increased the selling pressure and March fell
sharply in response. Further selling in after-hours' trading saw March slip
back to 3,203, with volume at 20,414lots. Increased rolling forward into the
June contract brought turnover of 8,203.
In the FT-SE Mid 250 on the Liffe, 106 lots were traded and it closed at
3,907. The same contract on the OMLX saw business of 6 lots and it ended at
3,908.4.
Volume in the Liffe traded options improved to 39,393 contracts. The index
options were the busiest, with 16,270 traded in the FT-SE 100 option and
9,177 in the Euro FT-SE 100 option.
