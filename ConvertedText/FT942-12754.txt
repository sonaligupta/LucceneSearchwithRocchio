FT  28 APR 94 / Ban on GCHQ unions maintained


Demands by opposition MPs that workers at the government's secret
communications headquarters at Cheltenham should be allowed to join a union
were rejected by a government majority of 61 (283-222) in the Commons last
night.
Mr David Davis, public service minister, said the national interest required
the ban on union membership, imposed in 1984, to be maintained.
He reaffirmed the government's willingness to allow workers to join a staff
federation. Mr Allan Rogers, Labour foreign affairs spokesman, likened the
staff federation to a 'Stalinist trade union'.
