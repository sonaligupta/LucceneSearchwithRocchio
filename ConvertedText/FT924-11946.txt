FT  23 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Linx Printing shares at 14p premium


   By RICHARD GOURLAY


Shares of Linx Printing Technologies, a maker of continuous ink jet printing
equipment, ended their first day of trading at 144p, a 14p premium to the
price at which they were placed last week.
The company joins quoted Domino Printing Sciences and a small handful of
British companies that have successfully developed commercial applications
for high technology breakthroughs.
One of the two venture capital backers, MTI Managers, which represents 18
institutions with 37 per cent of the equity, has not disposed of any of its
stake during the flotation which values Linx at Pounds 20.8m. The other
backer, Paribas, has sold some of its holding.
During the ink jet process tiny droplets are given an electrical charge and
then deflected electronically as they are squirted from the printer head.
More than 120,000 droplets are projected each second.
The printers are placed at the end of production lines to print bar codes or
sell by dates on boxes, bottles and other produce with minimum operator
intervention. The process has been used to print on fibre optic cable.
Mr Derek Harris, chairman, said the group would use its stock market quote
and the technological expertise within the group to expand. 'We would like
to develop more in the product identification market,' he said.
Linx is the first successful flotation for MTI Managers. The group, which
specialises in technology start-ups, has invested Pounds 800,000 since Linx
was launched in 1987.
Of the Pounds 4.7m proceeds of the flotation, Linx has raised Pounds 1.3m
after expenses while shareholders have taken out Pounds 1.5m.
