FT  29 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Tuna re-export ban is upheld


   By DAMIAN FRASER


   MEXICO CITY


A San Francisco federal court has upheld a secondary ban on third countries
re-exporting Mexican and Venezuelan tuna to the US, in another twist to the
row over dolphin-killing by Mexican tuna fishermen, Damian Fraser reports
from Mexico City. The federal court gave 27 countries until Friday to prove
they were not re-exporting Mexican or Venezuelan tuna, banned from the US.
Countries ignoring the order will be included in the embargo. The main
Mexican and Venezuelan 'tuna-launderers', San Francisco environmentalists
say, are Japan, Italy, Spain, France, Costa Rica, Panama and Colombia. US
law, upheld by a federal court last February, mandates an embargo on a
country's tuna exports if the fleet's average dolphin mortality rate is 25
per cent higher than the US's.
