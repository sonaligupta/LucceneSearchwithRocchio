FT  01 JUL 92 / Bonn agrees to payfor old age homes

GERMANY'S ruling coalition yesterday agreed to finance old age care within
the public health services, adding a potential new burden to the costs of
social security facing German employers.
The deal should bring to an end one of the longest-running disputes in
German politics, which has bitterly divided the government, and left the
whole system of old age homes in limbo for the past 20 years.
Agreement was reached yesterday after the Free Democrats (FDP), the liberal
minority partner in the coalition, backed down and accepted that financing
of old age care would have to be included in the wider state health
insurance scheme.
Previously the FDP, strongly backed by German industry, had argued that old
age homes should be financed by individual, voluntary contributions.
The deal, which seeks to compensate employers for their higher social
security payments by relieving them of the legal requirement to pay sick pay
for a day away from work, was condemned by both employers and trade unions.
The former claimed that the long-term and incalculable costs of old age care
would not be fully compensated.
The trade unions announced total opposition, and threatened protest strikes,
if sick pay protection is affected. Absence through sickness in Germany is
widespread, because at present three days' sick pay are guaranteed.
The agreement was greeted with delight in the coalition, and in particular
by Mr Norbert Blum, the employment minister. 'After 20 years of debate, this
is a good day for the welfare state,' he said.
It is estimated that 1.65m old and disabled people currently qualify for
nursing care, a figure likely to rise by 250,000 by the year 2010. Places in
homes cannot be guaranteed, and some 270,000 receive social security
payments while staying at their own homes.
