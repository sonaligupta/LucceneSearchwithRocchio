FT  02 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee growers to taste foreign
trade


IN AN important move towards liberalisation of coffee marketing, the Indian
federal government is to allow growers to export the commodity independent
of the Coffee Board.
Encouraged by the success of its earlier scheme to allow the growers to
retain 30 per cent of the crop for marketing within the country, the
government has now given in to their demand to participate in the export
trade.
According to the new scheme, described as free sale quota (FSQ), growers
will keep 50 per cent of the crop for marketing inside and outside the
country.
The scheme will, however, become operational only when certain amendments
have been made to the Indian Coffee Act of 1942. As the Indian Parliament is
not in session now and the government wants the scheme to be operational
soon, the changes in the Act will be made through an ordinance.
The growers will make over the remaining 50 per cent of the crop to the
Coffee Board.
It is now clear that the government will progressively increase the size of
FSQ, reducing the marketing role of the board and placing a question mark
over the future of many of its 4,000 employees. According to growers'
organisations the Coffee Board, in common with other commodity boards,
should be concerned with research and development and promotion of the
beverage, particularly in India.
In the meantime, growers are confident that they will be able to realise a
better unit value from export sales than the board.
In fact, the stagnation in domestic coffee prices has already been broken
after the introduction of privately organised auctions.
There is a general sense of relief that a large-scale change in the coffee
trade will coincide with an expected bumper coffee harvest of more than
225,000 tonnes in 1993-94, up from 161,500 tonnes last year.
