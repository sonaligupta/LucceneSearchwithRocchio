FT  24 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Brent Chemicals dives 60% as recession
bites


   By RICHARD GOURLAY


BRENT Chemicals International reported a 60 per cent fall in profits as its
core businesses were hit by recession.
The pre-tax line fell from Pounds 13m to Pounds 5.24m after exceptional
items of Pounds 3.16m relating to the closure and reorganisation of
businesses which the company said would have been considered extraordinary
items under last year's accounting treatment.
Sales rose 11 per cent to Pounds 100m, largely due to acquisitions.
Mr Steve Cuthbert, chief executive, said Brent had successfully cut Pounds
2.8m of costs, had managed to increase research and development spending and
was coming to the end of a three year Pounds 20m investment programme.
The pre-press business had had a particularly good start to the year, and
civil aviation was also beginning to enjoy a recovery as people returned to
flying after the Gulf war.
While sales in industrial metals finishing were firm in January there was no
sign a recovery would continue. Nor were there any signs of recovery in the
electronics division.
Earnings per share fell from 13.4p to 2.9p. As promised in November when the
group announced a Pounds 15.6m rights issue, the final dividend is
maintained at 5.8p for an unchanged total of 7.4p.
