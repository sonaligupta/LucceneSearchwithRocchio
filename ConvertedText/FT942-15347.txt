FT  15 APR 94 / UK Company News: Leeds Permanent to test mortgage
securitisation


   By ANTONIA SHARPE and ALISON SMITH


Leeds Permanent Building Society, the UK's fifth largest, is close to
becoming the first society to fund its mortgage lending business through
securitisation, a financing technique in use in the US for more than a
decade.
Securitisation allows banks to take loans off their balance sheet, thereby
removing the risk of default and freeing up capital. Banks place the assets
in aspecial-purpose vehicle which then raises money by selling the debt
securities to investors. Interest on the so-called 'mortgage-backed'
securities are funded by the loan repayments.
It is now a trillion-dollar market in the US but its development in the UK
is at an early stage. In the past year, Barclays Bank and National
Westminster Bank have securitised mortgages and loans.
Regulatory constraints have hampered the use of securitisation by building
societies which last year had just under 60 per cent of the UK mortgage
market. However, the Building Society Commission, the sector's statutory
regulator, is due to publish guidelines within three months on how building
societies can securitise their assets.
Two other societies apart from Leeds - Nationwide and most notably Skipton -
have also carried out work on securitisation.
Leeds has spent the past two years setting up a system to securitise its
mortgages. 'We see securitisation as an important source of funding in order
to cope with higher mortgage volumes,' said Mr Ian Stewart, general manager,
treasury, at the Leeds Permanent.
Leeds plans to test the system by using a pool of its mortgages as
collateral to raise up to Pounds 100m from a small group of banks rather
through selling securities in the public market.
'The analysis will be exactly the same as a fully blown securitisation,'
said Mr Stewart.
