FT  29 APR 94 / MoD criticised on costing of projects


   By BERNARD GRAY


The National Audit Office has found that the Ministry of Defence is too
optimistic about the timing and cost of large defence projects.
According to the government watchdog's report, most projects miss their
budgets because of unforeseen technical difficulties or underestimation of
costs by the MoD. It concludes that the ministry should pay more attention
to the early stages of projects, to obtain a more accurate picture of final
costs. A particular focus of concern is mid-life updates of existing
equipment such as the Tornado and Sea Harrier aircraft, Challenger 1 tank
and Trafalgar class submarines. Here the MoD has underestimated the risks
arising from over-ambitious aims and over-optimistic cost estimates.
