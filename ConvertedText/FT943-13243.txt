FT  20 JUL 94 / International Company News: TWA to axe services to 12 cities
and cut 475 jobs

   NEW YORK


Trans World Airlines, the sixth biggest US carrier, is to axe air services
to 12 cities in the north-east at the end of the summer as part of its
efforts to restore the airline to profitability. Some 475 jobs will go.
The services being cut are flown by TWA's Trans World Express subsidiary, a
short-haul operator that TWA bought from Pan American World Airways in 1991
to provide feeder services for its long-haul operations out of New York.
TWA said it had become evident that many of the short-haul routes were not
feeding sufficient traffic into the long-haul network to justify the losses
they incurred, and these routes were being cut.
The cities that will lose Trans World Express services are Albany,
Binghamton, Buffalo, Ithaca, Rochester, Syracuse and Newburgh in New York;
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; Manchester, New Hampshire; Providence, Rhode
Island; Richmond, Virginia; and Portland, Maine.
American Airlines said yesterday that it was discontinuing its jet service
between Lubbock and Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas, from December because it was
unprofitable.
