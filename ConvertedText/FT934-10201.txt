FT  06 NOV 93 / International Company News: Volvo out of bounds in Spanish
golf tournament

   STOCKHOLM


VOLVO, the Swedish motor and energy group, stirred up a new row yesterday in
its efforts to win support for the controversial proposed merger of its car
and trucks operation with state-owned Renault of France.
The Stockholm stock exchange reacted sharply to an unauthorised announcement
by Volvo that its truck division had posted a SKr183m (Dollars 22m)
operating profit in the first nine months of the year, a dramatic turnround
from a SKr586m loss in the same period last year.
Volvo, which is not due to report its nine-month result until November 18,
released the figures as part of a presentation of the Renault merger plan to
journalists at the company-sponsored golf tournament in Spain.
The stock exchange quickly demanded shareholders be given the same
information and said it would investigate the incident to decide if Volvo
had broken bourse rules.
The news of the improvement in Volvo Trucks is likely to have a mixed effect
on the fierce debate among Volvo shareholders over whether to support the
Renault deal at a special meeting on December 7.
