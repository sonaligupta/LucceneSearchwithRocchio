FT  12 MAR 92 / International Company News: Hertz modifies NY plan


   By NIKKI TAIT


HERTZ, the largest car rental company in the US, yesterday qualified its
highly controversial plan to introduce surcharges for New York City rental
customers - just one day before the New York City Council is due to vote on
a plan to ban residence-based surcharges, writes Nikki Tait.
Hertz, 49 per cent owned by Ford Motor Company, is now proposing to exempt
certain New York City residents who qualify under a 'responsible renter'
programme from the daily surcharge scheme. To qualify, a resident would need
a driving record free of accidents for three years, and to have been
employed for at least one year.
Someone applying under the scheme would pay a one-off processing fee of
Dollars 25.
Hertz's decision earlier this year to introduce daily surcharges on cars
rented by residents living in four of the city's five boroughs, unleashed a
storm of protest.
The surcharges would range from Dollars 3 a day for Manhattan residents to
Dollars 56 a day for Bronx residents. Queens residents would pay Dollars 15
a day, and Brooklyn residents, Dollars 34. Cars rented in New York,
Connecticut, Pennsylvania and New Jersey would be affected.
Critics claimed that this was illegal discrimination, weighing unfairly on
areas with large ethnic populations.
But Hertz claimed its action reflected the underlying cost situation - with
rentals in these areas tending to result in more accidents and suits from
pedestrians and others injured.
