FT  05 MAR 94 / ANC woos top businessmen


   By MATTHEW CURTIN


   JOHANNESBURG


The African National Congress's determination to engage the South African
business community in the task of reconstruction and development has stepped
up a gear with an appeal for co-operation with the private sector by Mr
Tokyo Sexwale, who is expected to head the country's most powerful
industrial region after next month's elections.
Mr Sexwale, top of the ANC's list of provincial candidates, told a meeting
of 44 prominent businessmen that the Pretoria-Johannesburg area, where he
would be in charge, was 'the engine room' of the South African economy. 'If
I put one foot wrong I'll sink it. We don't want your votes, we want your
wisdom.'
He warned the audience - which included Mr Sol Kerzner, chairman of the Sun
International gambling and casino empire and Mr Clem Sunter, chairman of
Anglo American's gold division - that it was essential for ordinary South
Africans to be given a far bigger stake in the economy. 'If you give them
politics, a flag .. and you think that's change, you are merely preparing
for a second, more deadly, revolution,' he said.
It was also vital for South Africa to become competitive internationally for
fear of being 'eaten for breakfast' by Pacific Rim countries. The meeting
was the first in a series of provincial ANC business leadership forums and
was followed by a closed discussion session where debate drew a warm
response from businessmen. 'If the previous government had done the same
thing we would be much better off today,' said Mr Dorian Wharton-Hood,
vice-chairman of assurer Liberty Life.
Mr Sexwale's comments come amid growing concern from some quarters that the
business community has not done enough to voice its vision of economic
development and has failed to table an industrial strategy of its own.
