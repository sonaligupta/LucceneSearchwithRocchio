FT  02 NOV 93 / International Company News: Tenneco chief gets all clear on
brain tumour


   By MARTIN DICKSON


   NEW YORK


MR MICHAEL Walsh, the architect of a two-year turnround at US conglomerate
Tenneco and one of the most highly regarded executives in the US, said
yesterday that a tumour discovered on his brain last January was beginning
to break up. He said his doctors expected him to live a normal life span,
barring unforeseen circumstances.
The news will be welcomed by shareholders and employees of Tenneco, where Mr
Walsh, 51, is only part of the way through a restructuring of the company to
restore earnings momentum and boost the stock price.
Mr Walsh, who turned round the Union Pacific railroad before joining
Tenneco, announced the discovery of the brain tumour last January and said
then that the median survival rate for patients with this condition,
detected at an early state, was about five to six years.
Yesterday, Mr Walsh said that his doctors had assured him that the tumour
had stopped growing and that recent tests had revealed no active tumour
lesions anywhere in his brain.
He said he was working a normal schedule but would continue to have residual
physical symptoms - a weakness on the left side of his body - until time
allowed the break-up and removal of dead tumour tissue.
'The programme of accelerated radiation, combined with aggressive
chemotherapy, has been tough, but it has worked,' Mr Walsh said.
He said that he would continue with a full regimen of chemotherapy through
to next spring, a treatment intended to prevent a recurrence of the tumour.
'Obviously my family and I could not be more delighted.' Mr Walsh added.
'Thank God for modern medicine.'
