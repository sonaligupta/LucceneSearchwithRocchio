FT  12 MAR 93 / Observer: Hanging on


One reason why BTR is a higher rated conglomerate than Hanson is that the
stock market believes BTR knows how to handle management succession. Unlike
Lord Hanson, Sir Owen Green knows when to step aside.
Even so, eyebrows will cock at 65-year-old Norman Ireland's elevation to the
BTR chair. He has been around almost as long as Green, which raises the
suspicion that in essence BTR is little different from from Hanson when it
comes down to the old guard clinging on to power.
It suggests that, while Alan Jackson is a jolly good chief executive, he may
not have the right sort of presentation skills to be chairman.
Perhaps Ireland should show he's his own man by promptly abolishing Green's
ban on the recruiting of non-executive directors from outside.
