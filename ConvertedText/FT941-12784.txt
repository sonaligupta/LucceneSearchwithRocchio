FT  28 JAN 94 / Arts: Today's Television


   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY


Radio 3 starts the evening with a live concert from St David's Hall,
Cardiff, where the BBC National Orchestra Of Wales, conducted by Tadaaki
Otaka, plays 'Peinture' by Edison Denisov and Mozart's Concerto for Two
Pianos, then, after an interval talk, Elgar's 1st Symphony (7.30).
What a pity to see comedian Alexei Sayle joining the finger waggers to
present a new BBC1 series, Drive, urging us all to drive safely. No doubt we
should do so, but the world is full of bossy types - Virginia Bottomley,
Jonathan Porritt, 'Jenni' Murray, any number of policemen - who would be
naturals in this role. Worse, Sayle is quoted in his opening sermon as
claiming that we all become predatory animals 'the second we step on a gas
pedal' (8.50 BBC1).
Best series of the week is Further Abroad in which Jonathan Meades explores
the oddness of Britain and the British. Today's subject is pigs (9.30 BBC2).
Oddest 'light entertainment' series for years is The Unpleasant World Of
Penn And Teller, a sort of conjuring show for horror movie fans (10.30 C4).
