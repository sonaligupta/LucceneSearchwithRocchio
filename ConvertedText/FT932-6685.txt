FT  27 MAY 93 / People: From BBC to dreaming spires


James Arnold-Baker, head of BBC Enterprises, is to be the next chief
executive of Oxford University Press.
Arnold-Baker has been in charge of all commercial operations of the BBC  -
from books and magazines to the sale of programmes abroad - for the past
seven years. Before that, he was a marketing executive at Fischer Price
toys.
The BBC executive simply saw an advertisement for the Oxford job and
applied.
'It's a very exciting opportunity,' said Arnold-Baker, whose BBC contract
does not expire until September.
'I have built a nice little business (at the BBC), but now it's time to move
on,' said Arnold- Baker, who is also a member of the BBC board of
management.
He believes there are real similarities between the BBC and Oxford
University Press. Both combine public service and commercialism.
