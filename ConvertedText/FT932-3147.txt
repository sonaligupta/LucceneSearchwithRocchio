FT  16 JUN 93 / Ventriglia under investigation


Mr Ferdinando Ventriglia, long-standing chairman of the Bank of Naples, was
yesterday advised he was under investigation for alleged illicit financing
of political parties. The move by Naples magistrates is the first time a top
member of Italy's banking community has become involved in the corruption
scandals.
The investigation also concerns Mr Paolo Cirino Pomiconi, former finance
minister and one of the city's most powerful Christian Democrat politicians,
who has already been linked to at least three other important inquiries.
Naples magistrates are following up some L300m (Pounds 133,000) alleged to
have been paid by the Bank of Naples for a rugby championship sponsored by
the Naples sports asscociation, Polisportiva, of which Mr Pomicino was
president until last May.
