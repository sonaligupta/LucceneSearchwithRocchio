FT  13 APR 92 / Rate cut hopes rest on market reaction


   By EDWARD BALLS


TREASURY officials are waiting to see the markets' considered reaction to
the election result before deciding whether to cut interest rates.
The pound gained 2 1/2 pfennigs during Friday's trading. But the Treasury
dampened hopes of a rapid rate cut to speed recovery.
'Friday's reaction was not necessarily the last word about whether or not
the election result alters the scope for interest rate cuts,' a Treasury
official said.
City analysts expect the government to resist an early interest rate cut, or
a move to narrow bands within the European exchange rate mechanism until the
recovery is clearly underway.
Mr Bill Martin, chief UK economist at UBS Phillips & Drew, thinks the
government will wait to see how much pent-up expenditure was delayed by the
election before deciding whether to cut rates.
The government's room for manoeuvre on interest rates may be limited by high
German rates. UK rates are only  3/4 of a percentage point higher than in
Germany and no ERM country has lower rates than in Germany.
