FT  01 NOV 93 / Construction Contracts: Gammon wins Pounds 370m orders


GAMMON CONSTRUCTION, the Hong Kong-based company jointly owned by Trafalgar
House Construction and Jardine Pacific, has won orders worth Pounds 370m
(HKDollars 4.2bn), including its first significant contract in Indonesia.
The largest orders are for two sub-contracts worth Pounds 120m on the
Western Harbour Crossing for Nishimatsu Construction Company. The main
contract involves the design and construction of a third immersed tube road
tunnel under Hong Kong Harbour to include northern and southern approaches.
The tunnel will provide a vital link between Hong Kong Island and West
Kowloon.
Gammon will construct all the land based works on Hong Kong Island - 3.5km
of pre-stressed elevated highway structures founded on barrettes and bored
piles, a 300m long cut and cover tunnel, to be formed by top down
construction between diaphragm walls, numerous linking ramps and an
underpass, extensive drainage and utilities.
In Indonesia, Gammon in joint operation with P T Total Bangun Persada will
build the Pounds 60m Landmark III and IV office towers at the Landmark
Centre in central Jakarta (pictured above).
The 31-month project is for developer P T Panen Subur and includes the
construction of twin 24-storey office blocks above a two-level basement
carpark area and a two-level podium containing retail outlets, carpark and
extensive landscaped areas.
Other Hong Kong orders include additional power station work and building on
the Dorset House development in Quarry Bay.
Gammon is already building twin office towers of 40 and 43 storeys in the
bay area.
