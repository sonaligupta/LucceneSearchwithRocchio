FT  02 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: LCE raw sugar contract hit by
volume slump


   By ALISON MAITLAND


TRADING volume in the London Commodity Exchange's new raw sugar futures
contract has slumped after a buoyant start.
Volumes in the contract, launched on October 1, fell from 1,655 lots on the
first day to as low as 15 lots on October 26, giving an average for the
month of 370 lots a day.
Mr Robin Woodhead, LCE chief executive, said: 'Whilst we want to see much
greater levels than currently, it's still very early days and there would
still seem to be a high level of support from the trade.
'We remain optimistic that volumes will increase once the physical market
becomes more active.'
The premium contract was launched to take advantage of dissatisfaction with
the raw sugar contract traded on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New
York. Many traders disagreed with a decision to allow Brazilian crystal
sugar to be delivered against the New York contract, saying it should not be
classed as raw sugar.
ED& F. Man, the London trading house, said the downward trend in volume must
be causing concern to the LCE. But Ms Angela Mutton, sugar researcher with
Man, pointed out that volumes had been subdued in New York as well as London
last month.
Mr Chris Pack, sugar analyst at C. Czarnikow, another London trade house,
said the contract faced a 'catch-22 situation', with volumes unlikely to
pick up until the physical trade began to show interest.
'The sugar producers are looking for volume, and until they're in there,
there won't be the volume.'
