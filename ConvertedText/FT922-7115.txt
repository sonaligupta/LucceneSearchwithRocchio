FT  20 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses fall back after
Monday's enthusiasm


   By Our Markets Staff and HILARY BARNES


MOST bourses fell back after Monday's gains, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT consolidated, with news of a 5.8 per cent building workers' pay
deal helping to maintain the equilibrium. Carmakers and engineers, which led
on Monday after the settlement of the metalworkers' pay talks, were mixed
and the main move came in chemicals.
At Hoare Govett, Mr Robert Willis took the view that the pay settlements and
the removal of the solidarity tax in the second half of this year should
give the German consumer, and German equities a good run between now and
Christmas. The DAX and FAZ indices seemed to support this, rising another
4.83 to 1,763.26 and 2.43 to 710.56 respectively.
Turnover fell from DM8.2bn to DM7.2bn. BASF and Bayer led chemicals up with
rises of DM3.50 to DM243.90 and DM4.40 to DM293.90. Companies with long-term
problems shed the gains achieved on Monday as Deutsche Babcock fell DM4 to
DM167.50 and Porsche going further with a drop of DM15 to DM490.
Linde added another DM8.50 to Monday's DM24 gain, closing at DM852.50 after
its forecast of at least 10 per cent turnover growth this year and
satisfactory profits.
Continental, rose DM2 to DM265.50 on reports that the state government of
Lower Saxony was encouraging companies in the state to take stakes in the
tyre maker and on rumours that Sumitomo of Japan was interested in the Conti
stake owned by Pirelli.
PARIS ran into profit-taking and arbitrage ahead of the close of the account
on Thursday. The CAC-40 index fell 28.51 or 1.4 per cent to 2,023.13 in
modest turnover of FFr2.2bn.
Generale des Eaux dropped FFr50 to FFr2,390 on news that it was spending
DM1bn in buying and modernising Berlin's Defa film studios.
The biggest loser of the day was the insurer UAP which dropped FFr27 or 4.8
per cent to FFr541 in arbitrage-related trading. Another casualty was Euro
Disney which fell FFr3.80 or 2.9 per cent to FFr124.
Pinault rose FFR6.30 to FFr371 amid talk that it was close to selling off
its wood joinery activities.
MILAN fell back after Monday's brief recovery, dragged down by reports that
Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI) could face up to L1,000bn in back taxes and
fines stemming from its takeover of a loss-making Milan state bank two years
ago. The Comit index lost 1.85 to 472.80 in turnover estimated at
L70bn-L80bn after Monday's L85.6bn.
BCI dropped L123 or 4 per cent to L2,918, dragging the rest of the banking
sector down with it. Industrials bucked the weaker trend however, with
Olivetti, gaining L47 to L3,032 and Fiat adding L6 to L4,941.
AMSTERDAM had a quiet day with the CBS Tendency index closing unchanged at
129.4. Fokker attracted some interest early on, rising 50 cents to Fl 36.60,
following Monday's news that a consortium of European aerospace companies
was negotiating to take a 51 per cent stake in the group. However,
profit-taking pushed the price down to close 10 cents off at Fl 36.10, but
above an intraday low of Fl 35.70.
KLM gained 10 cents to Fl 39.40 on rumours, later denied, that merger talks
with BA had been reopened.
Unilever saw one of the day's biggest falls, losing Fl 1.00 to Fl 185.60
following its disappointing first quarter figures. However, some analysts
feel that the group is in line for recovery, with earnings growth forecast
for 1993.
STOCKHOLM recovered after a weak start to end flat. The Affarsvarlden
general index eased just 0.2 to 998.4, in turnover of SKr580m.
Asea rose SKr4 to SKr377 after reporting a pre-tax profit of SKr624m in the
first quarter, in line with expectations. But Volvo tumbled ahead of news
that it swung to a pre-tax loss after financial items of SKr248m in the
first quarter. Volvo B free's lost SKr4 to SKr431 at the close and was
quoted at SKr429 in London later in the day.
COPENHAGEN registered its fifth successive decline, the all-share index
falling another 2.80 to 334.26. The shipping shares, Svendborg B and 1912 B,
fell by DKr3,200 to DKr133,100 and DKr3,100 to DKr93,400 respectively. Low
turnover, ahead of the June 2 referendum to clarify Denmark's future
relationship to the EC, continues to plague the market, writes Hilary
Barnes.
MADRID's general index eased 0.86 to 259.76. Telefonica continued to attract
buyers following Monday's pleasing first quarter results, gaining Pta10 to
Pta1,115 in volume of some 2.6m shares.
