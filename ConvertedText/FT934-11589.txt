FT  30 OCT 93 / International Company News: Galeries Lafayette in retailer
deal

GALERIES Lafayette, one of France's leading stores groups, is taking full
control of Monoprix, the retail chain. It is buying a 37.77 per cent stake
from the Malard family in a FFr500m (Dollars 85.3m) deal.
The Monoprix deal, which increases the Galeries Lafayette holding from 54.96
to 93.79 per cent, comes only two years after its last significant
acquisition, the FFr2.87bn deal for the Nouvelles Galeries retail concern.
Galeries Lafayette, still burdened by heavy debts due to the Nouvelles
Galeries deal and the cost of opening its troubled New York store, has
negotiated to pay for the Monoprix stake in a series of instalments until
the end of 1996.
Monoprix is one of the largest and best-known retail chains in France
selling general merchandise, such as clothing and household goods, as well
as food. Galeries Lafayette has already installed Monoprix supermarkets in
some of its own sites.
The Monoprix deal comes at a turbulent time for French retailing. Many
retail groups have been badly affected by the recession.
Galeries Lafayette reported a net loss of FFr140m for the first half of this
year, having only just broken even in 1992.
The retail sector has also been destabilised by a series of mergers and
acquisitions. Pinault-Printemps is still selling assets in an attempt to
reduce the debts incurred by its takeover of Au Printemps. FNAC, the music
and books chain, was sold this autumn because of the financial problems of
GMF, its old parent company.
Tesco, the UK food retailing group, earlier this year bought Catteau
supermarkets.
