FT  20 APR 94 / Merger of general unions in trouble


   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor


The planned merger between Britain's two main general unions - the TGWU and
the GMB - has run into serious trouble.
Last week the GMB executive council decided to recommend to its annual
conference in June that the unions should have only 'a closer working
relationship'.
Both unions had been expected to give firm backing to specific merger
proposals at their conferences this summer. Although a full merger is still
possible, it is likely to happen more slowly than originally envisaged.
GMB officials are des-cribing the merger talks as stalled rather than broken
down. Opposition to the merger within the union is being led by Mr Ernie
Hughes, secretary of the Lancashire region, and Mr Nick Anderson, secretary
of the northern region.
Mr John Edmonds, GMB general secretary, still strongly favours merger, but
is not likely to press the issue until he is safely re-elected as general
secretary next year.
The five joint working parties which reported at the end of last month were
all positive about the merger, but union officials and lay activists on both
sides have become more aware of the large cultural divide between them.
The TGWU is activist-led and the GMB is official-led. Also, the TGWU is
politically well to the left of the GMB. Many GMB officials fear being
swamped by the bigger TGWU.
The TGWU's dominant left group also has reservations about the merger.
