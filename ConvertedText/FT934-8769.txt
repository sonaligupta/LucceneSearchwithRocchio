FT  13 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Unilever results disappoint


   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and PETER JOHN


FOOD manufacturing giant Unilever fell heavily for a second consecutive
session as the market reacted badly to third quarter figures yesterday.
Pre-tax profits, at Pounds 613m, came towards the bottom of market
forecasts, with the European ice cream business particularly weak on poor
weather. However, North America was better than some expectations. The
shares, which had tumbled 27 on Thursday, fell a further 17 yesterday to
close at 1086p. Turnover was a lumpy 4.3m.
Some analysts said that the disappointing results had demonstrated the
group's inevitable exposure to the current blight in the food manufacturing
sector. Several of the other leading stocks have been hit in recent sessions
by downgrades and negative notes as brokers have responded to the price war
among the food retailers. Smith New Court, which is recommending the stock
be sold at current levels, is worried about Unilever's margins, especially
in the low inflationary environment. The broker cut its full-year forecast
by Pounds 50m to Pounds 2.25bn, with the market range around Pounds
2.20bn-Pounds 2.35bn.
