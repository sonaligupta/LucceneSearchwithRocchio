FT  06 AUG 93 / Lamont response includes hint


MR NORMAN LAMONT yesterday hinted that he would eventually give his own
account of what happened on Black Wednesday.
He hit back at Sir Edward Heath, the former prime minister, over his attack
on the ex-chancellor's handling of events leading up to sterling's
suspension from the European exchange rate mechanism last September. Mr
Lamont said: 'I do not accept what Sir Edward Heath says.'
In a letter to The Times Mr Lamont accused Sir Edward of 'oddly' muddling
his views up with those of Mr John Major, the prime minister.
