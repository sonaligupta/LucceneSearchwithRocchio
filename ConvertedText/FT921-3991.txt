FT  11 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Richard Lines resigns from MTM


   By RICHARD GOURLAY


MR RICHARD LINES, the chairman and founder of MTM resigned yesterday
following a tumultuous week in which the speciality chemical manufacturer's
market value fell by more than two thirds as a result of two profits
warnings.
Mr Tom Baxter, the finance director, will also step down following
completion of the audit of the 1991 results, the publication of which has
been delayed by protracted discussions with the auditors.
The resignations end a stormy relationship between Mr Lines and his City
backers who have questioned some of MTM's less-than-conservative accounting
policies. Many institutions also objected to Mr Lines' autocratic management
style.
'He did not have a very high opinion of people in the City,' said one
analyst. 'He was an example of the kind of people running public companies
who would rather be running a private company.'
The company gave no explanation as to why Mr Lines had resigned. The
resignations leave shareholders with no clearer idea of the value of their
company's assets or the 1991 profits which MTM will now release on March 31.
The share price closed at the end of the day down 14p at 105p.
Mr Donald Mackay will become non-executive chairman. He has been a
non-executive director since 1986 and a former director of finance at ICI
Chemicals and Polymers.
The board is otherwise unchanged from February 2 when MTM told the markets,
institutions and apparently Robert Fleming, its merchant bankers, that the
only disagreement with its auditors was over application of accounting
policy.
The disagreement, MTM said, had no impact on trading profits or on the
company's cash position. Last Monday MTM followed this statement with an
apparently contradictory second announcement that said trading profits would
be significantly below City expectations.
