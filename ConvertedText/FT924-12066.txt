FT  22 OCT 92 / International Company News: Li Ka-shing in Vancouver deal

CONCORDE Pacific, a Canadian company controlled by Hong Kong magnate Mr Li
Ka-shing, is bringing in an outside partner to help finance a large property
development on Vancouver's waterfront.
Canadian Maple Leaf Financial, a publicly-traded company which has its
origins in a fund set up for investor immigrants mostly from Hong Kong, has
agreed to contribute CDollars 150m (USDollars 120m) in equity and debt to
develop a section of the 12m sq ft Pacific Place project.
In return, Mr Li will become a significant minority shareholder in Canadian
Maple Leaf (CML), whose interests include investments in Canada's biggest
car park operator. CML has also helped finance the Canadian production of
Phantom of the Opera, and has a stake in a stage lighting and sound company.
Mr Stephen Funk, CML's president, said Concorde Pacific would invest about
CDollars 5m in the form of a convertible debenture.
Pacific Place is one of the biggest residential and commercial projects
under construction in North America. It will cover about 200 acres, or 50
blocks, on the site of the Expo 86 fair on the southern fringe of
Van-couver's business district.
The plans include 42 apartment buildings and 3m sq ft of offices, shops and
a 400-room hotel. CML's contribution will be used to finance about 1m sq ft
of low-income housing on the site.
Concorde also recently sold a small parcel of the development to a sports
and entertainment company which plans to put up a small stadium.
Mr Li and his partners bought the Pacific Place site from the British
Columbia government in 1988 for CDollars 320m. Concorde made a down payment
of CDollars 50m, with the rest to be paid between 1994 and 2003.
