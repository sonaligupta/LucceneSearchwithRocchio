FT  07 JAN 94 / Observer: Penalty point


Paraguay's football league championship - now being decided by ballot after
alleged skulduggery - is not the first such Latin soccer own-goal.
In 1984 the Brazilian soccer authorities decided on a promotion from a lower
division after a similar bagunco, or foul-up. The method was to draw
numbered balls from a bag. Bangu, a Rio de Janeiro club, won with number
nine.
The superstitious inhabitants of Rio - for whom nine is a lucky number  -
went wild next day, betting heavily on combinations of nines in the illegal
but widely played numbers game, where nine was also represented by a snake
for the many players who are innumerate.
The bicheiros, the bankers of the game, held their breath . . . and nine did
not appear in any winning combination. But then bookies and snakes have all
the luck . . .
