Kenya will have to import huge stocks of food after poor 1991 harvests,
according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO),
Reuter reports from Nairobi.
'Following this poor harvest, substantial imports of maize will be needed in
1992  .. Imports of about 280,000 tonnes of wheat and rice will also be
necessary,' said the FAO report.
This will be the first time Kenya has been forced to import food due to
shortages since the crisis of 1980-81.
