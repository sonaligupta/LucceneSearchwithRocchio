FT  08 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Chemical forecast chopped


   By PETER JOHN and JEFFREY BROWN


Chemicals group Courtaulds fell 19 to 440p as one leading broker chopped
full-year forecasts by around 12 per cent just two weeks before the
company's interim figures.
The move was carried out by UBS, and although the house chemicals analysts
were unavailable for comment, rivals said forecasts for the current year and
the following year had been reduced by Pounds 20m. The existing range of
predictions for this year was between Pounds 160m and Pounds 180m.
UBS had been a long term seller and was believed to have hardened its stance
in reaction to the rising price of commodity chemicals, of which Courtaulds
is a big buyer. Nevertheless there was some surprise at the timing of the
move as the company is currently in closed season and any view would need to
have been taken independently.
