FT  22 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: If you're bent on buying, here's how
to do it ..


   By PHILIP COGGAN


For most investors, the cheapest way of buying gilts is through the National
Savings Stock Register, forms for which can be obtained at the post office.
A drawback is that the NSSR is a postal-only service; thus, by the time it
has received your order, prices may have moved against you. But the reverse
can also happen - besides which, price movements over a day or so should not
make all that much difference for long-term holders.
For purchases of under Pounds 250, the NSSR's commission is a standard
Pounds 1. For larger buys, the cost is Pounds 1 plus 50p for every further
Pounds 125 or part thereof. Thus, a Pounds 1,000 purchase of gilts would
cost Pounds 4; a Pounds 10,000 deal would cost Pounds 40.
For sales, the commission is 10p for every Pounds 10 or part thereof if the
proceeds are less than Pounds 100. Between Pounds 100 and Pounds 250, the
rate is Pounds 1; above Pounds 250, the charges work in the same way as for
purchases.
Only Pounds 25,000 of a stock can be bought or sold in one day via the NSSR,
which could cause some problems for large investors. As a result, they may
prefer to deal through a stockbroker.
Unless you are dealing in sums of over Pounds 10,000, a conventional
stockbroker probably will be more expensive that the NSSR; however, you will
be more certain about the price of your gilts and you might be able to
benefit from the broker's advice.
If you do not feel capable of making your own gilt selection, you could buy
into a bond fund. There are around 29 bond unit trusts and, like their
equity relatives, they own a wide spread of stocks - although this does not
eliminate risk. In the 12 months to October 1, the average gilts trust lost
10.4 per cent.
The fund manager's expertise also comes at a price: initial charges can be
up to 6 per cent and annual charges range from 0.5 to 1.5 per cent. These
will obviously reduce investors' income.
Furthermore, while gains on gilts held directly are free of capital gains
tax, gains from gilt unit trusts are not.
