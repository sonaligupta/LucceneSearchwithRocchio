FT  12 APR 94 / UK Company News: Exports prompt leap at Dinkie Heel


Pre-tax profits of Dinkie Heel, the footwear component manufacturer, more
than trebled from Pounds 201,000 to Pounds 649,000 for the 1993 year.
Turnover from continuing operations expanded 11 per cent to Pounds 7.4m
(Pounds 6.67m) while exports continued to rise with a 38 per cent gain.
Directors pointed out that exports accounted for 30 per cent of total
turnover. Sales to the Americas virtually doubled in 1993 and at Pounds
739,000, 'this now represents the company's largest export market'.
Earnings per share were 3.84p, compared with 1.31p, and the dividend is
lifted to 1.4p (0.95p) with a final of 0.9p.
Sales in the UK benefited from increased sales of toe caps and of 'the more
robust styles of rubber sole units which have been very fashionable',
directors said.
Trading results for the 1994 first quarter were encouraging, they added.
