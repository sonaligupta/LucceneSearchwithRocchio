FT  12 NOV 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report


   By REUTER


COFFEE lost Pounds 6 a tonne yesterday to reach Pounds 1,264 as traders
waited anxiously for the latest Brazilian coffee auction which was due to
take place after the market's close. Brazil's commitments to the producers'
retention scheme mean it had to buy 264,000 bags of coffee in last night's
auction and a final auction to be held today. Traders yesterday expressed
scepticism about whethe producers could manage to buy so much in such a
short time. A depressed NICKEL market extended early losses by the close,
dealers said. Trade support around the Dollars 4,600 a tonne level
eventually gave way and a sluggish fundamental picture did little to help
the price, which ended at Dollars 4,587.50 a tonne, down Dollars 105.
Analysts suggested nickel had further to fall. The Baltic Freight Index
(BFI) faced a testing period following the reform of its component routes
and its performance will have to be assessed in a year's time, Baltic
Exchange chairman Peter Tudball said. 'The BFI is effectively on trial until
next year. But if the (latest reforms) can't succeed in winning back more
volume (to the freight chartering market), it is difficult to see what
will,' he said.
