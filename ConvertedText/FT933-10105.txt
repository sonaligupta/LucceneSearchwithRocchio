FT  05 AUG 93 / Romanian coalminers defiant


   By REUTER


   PETROSANI


Thousands of Romanian coalminers yesterday vowed to continue a strike in the
Balkan state's Jiu Valley mines until the government agreed to their pay
demands, Reuter reports from Petrosani.
Mr Miron Cosma, who brought the area's 45,000 miners out on strike on Monday
and has led the miners on violent marches through Bucharest over the past
three years, renewed a call to Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu to visit the
Jiu Valley. The miners have demanded a doubling in pay, increasing basic
monthly wages to up to 224,000 lei (Dollars 280), which with bonuses would
give the miners up to 500,000 lei, 10 times the national average wage.
