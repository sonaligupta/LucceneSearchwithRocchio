FT  06 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading


   By JOEL KIBAZO


CONTINUED weakness in the Gilts market weakened stock index futures, pulling
the cash market lower and sending the contract to a discount to the index on
several occasions in the course of a volatile session, writes Joel Kibazo.
The June contract on the FT-SE opened strongly at 2,686, a 7-point premium
to the cash market, but the optimistic mood did not last.
The weakness in gilts spilled over into FT-SE futures sending the contract
tumbling to 2,666 by lunch time. Following a period of sideways trading,
June attempted a rally which saw the contract creep back up to 2,676. But,
with no support from a weak Wall Street, June once again fell back, this
time to 2,644, the low of the day.
June closed at 2,673, down 14 on the previous close and around 1 point below
its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 6. Turnover was poor at
6,520.
Turnover in traded options remained poor at 26,313, with Midland bank
dominating the day's trading. It traded 5,576 contracts as dealers took
profits in the wake of the news that Lloyds Bank had withdrawn its proposed
bid for its rival.
