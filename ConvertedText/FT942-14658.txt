FT  19 APR 94 / International Company News: Intel's record run continues in
quarter

Intel, the world's largest maker of computer chips, reported strong growth
in revenues and earnings for the first quarter, its seventh consecutive
quarter of record results.
Revenue for the first quarter totalled Dollars 2.66bn, up from Dollars
2.02bn a year ago. Net income was Dollars 617m, or Dollars 1.40 per share,
compared with Dollars 548m, or Dollars 1.24 per share, in last year's first
quarter.
Growth was driven by a 'steady migration of computer buyers toward higher
performance (personal computer) systems,' said Mr Andrew Grove, president
and chief executive.
First quarter orders set another company record, he said.
Intel is the leading supplier of microprocessor chips to the personal
computer industry.
Strong demand for personal computers, together with a slight increase in the
average price of microprocessors, is driving the company's growth.
Intel is 'on the most aggressive processor (production) ramp in our history
in order to deliver Pentium processors in high volume for mass market PCs,'
said Mr Grove.
The Pentium is Intel's latest and highest performance microprocessor.
The company aims to produce 6m-7m Pentium chips this year, with Pentium
sales expected to represent 25 per cent of fourth quarter sales to the PC
industry, Intel said.
The company said that in the first quarter revenues came 51 per cent from
the Americas, 27 per cent from Europe, 8 per cent from Japan and 14 per cent
from the Asia-Pacific region.
