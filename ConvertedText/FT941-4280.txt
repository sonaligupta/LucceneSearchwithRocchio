FT  11 MAR 94 / International Company News: Paper group's stock down further

International Paper's shares continued to fall in New York yesterday, a day
after the company told securities analysts that first-quarter results would
be below expectations.
The company, which benefited through much of 1993 from price increases in
its primary product line, uncoated sheet paper, is suffering from heavy
discounting this quarter, analysts said.
Wall Street had been projecting first-quarter earnings of about 75 cents per
share. Ms Evadna Lynn, analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds, said those
estimates were being adjusted to between 65 and 70 cents.
International Paper reported earnings of Dollars 100m, or 81 cents per
share, in the fourth quarter of 1993.
Its stock, which fell 4 per cent, or Dollars 2 3/4 , on Wednesday, was a
further Dollars 1 3/4 lower at Dollars 69 3/4 by midday yesterday.
Ms Lynn estimated that prices for uncoated printing papers have dropped
Dollars 40 per ton from the fourth-quarter highs, erasing about half the
price gains of the first three quarters.
Moreover, price increases for linerboard and corrugated boxes, scheduled for
this spring, would be difficult to implement quickly, she said.
