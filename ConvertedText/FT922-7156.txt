FT  20 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Concentric rises 74% and calls for Pounds
12.5m


   By NIGEL CLARK


CONCENTRIC, the West Midlands-based maker of automotive and industrial
components and industrial controls, is raising Pounds 12.5m net of expenses
in a rights issue to fund investment.
The company also announced a 74 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits
from Pounds 2.02m to Pounds 3.52m on turnover down at Pounds 58.7m (Pounds
61.2m). The company said the progress made to recover margins was
encouraging and the improvement was expected to continue in the present
period.
The company is issuing 4.5m shares on a 1-for-5 basis at 285p in the
fully-underwritten rights. The share closed 15p higher at 355p.
The proceeds are earmarked for increasing output in the moulded plastic
components business and the metal pressing and fabrication business as well
as the US offshoot. Funds will also be used to address environmental
problems at its iron foundry.
The fall in turnover resulted from a decline in the world price of
aluminium, the erratic demand for satellite dishes and the generally flat
demand for the group's other products, the directors said.
Many of last year's problems at Concentric Pumps were said to be behind it
and Concentric Controls, which had undergone a considerable reorganisation,
was trading profitably after a number of difficult years.
In December Yorkshire Moulds moved into a new factory with twice the
previous capacity.
After tax of Pounds 1.09m (Pounds 627,000) earnings per share came out at
10.77p (6.19p). The interim dividend is unchanged at 3.54p and the company
expects the final dividend to be at least maintained at 7.63p.
