FT  15 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tories lose education vote


THE GOVERNMENT was defeated 70-61 in the Lords early today as peers backed a
cross-party move to ensure that councils had a continuing role in the
provision of special education in grant-maintained schools.
An amendment to the Education Bill sponsored by Baroness David (Lab),
Baroness Warnock (Ind) and Lord Addington (Lib Dem), would require governors
of such schools to submit reports to the local authority on the planning of
special education.
Lady David said later that the vote 'cuts across the government's
long-running vendetta against elected local education authorities'.
