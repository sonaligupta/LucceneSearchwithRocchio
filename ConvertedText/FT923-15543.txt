FT  01 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Loss for Greenwich Communications


Costs resulting from the closure of two subsidiaries pushed Greenwich
Communications, the USM-quoted radio and television services group, Pounds
92,000 into the red in the six months to February 29.
Turnover rose to Pounds 171,000 (Pounds 42,000) and at the operating level
there were profits of Pounds 18,000 (Pounds 32,000 losses).
Last time there was a Pounds 95,000 pre-tax loss and at the 1991 year end
losses amounted to Pounds 768,000.
Mr Alfred Stirling, chairman, said the exceptional charge of Pounds 180,000
was largely associated with the closure of Greenwich Satellite (GSL) and
Greenwich Satellite Espana (GSE).
Following the irregularities discovered in Spain, he recommended that,
should no additional share capital be raised by the local directors, GSE
should be put into liquidation.
Losses per share were 1.33p (1.36p).
