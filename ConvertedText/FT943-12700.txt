FT  23 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: The right time to improve financial
services rules


   From Mr S W HAND


Sir, The decision of Mr Justice Lightman to dismiss the action for damages
by Melton Medes against the Securities and Investments Board constitutes an
important clarification of the regulator's powers.
However, the case is ironic for drawing attention to the inadequacy of SIB's
powers under Section 179 of the Financial Services Act. This section is
excessively restrictive in that it prevents the SIB from releasing
prescribed information to private litigants ('customers' in
financial-services parlance) in the position of the plaintiff beneficiaries
in the Melton Medes case, even if a court order had been obtained.
This issue gave rise to great concern among members of the social security
committee when they were interviewing Prof Roy Goode in connection with the
report of the pension law review committee. The report of the PLRC noted:
'The ability of existing regulators to exchange information among themselves
is severely handicapped by statutory restrictions on the use for one
regulatory purpose of information obtained for another.'
Prof Goode's committee recommended that such statutory restriction should be
removed and the government has embraced this principle in its recent white
paper.
However, this would not rectify the problem which relates not only to the
exchange of information between regulators but also between regulators and
private litigants. There is a clear need for legislation in this area
empowering the courts to direct the release of information held by a
regulator to any person the court deems appropriate.
Given that the government has recently published its white paper on pensions
and is in the process of preparing the pensions bill, now would seem to be a
good time to improve the interaction of regulatory rules and trust law
principles.
