FT  22 JUL 93 / International Capital Markets: Itochu sets up Dollars 2.5bn
MTN programme

   TOKYO


ITOCHU Corp, the Japanese trading house, is to set up a Dollars 2.5bn
medium-term note programme in the first move by a Japanese company following
the Ministry of Finance's latest deregulation, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
The ministry last week allowed Japanese corporations to issue foreign bonds
overseas under a programme through which issuers can launch bonds quickly up
to a certain ceiling. The system will help shorten the time taken to issue
foreign bonds to three days from two weeks, the ministry said.
The programme, to be listed on the London Stock Exchange, will be set up
later this month. It is likely to issue Euroyen bonds first under the
programme, where the firm can issue bonds in most major currencies with
maturities of more than four years.
