FT  01 DEC 94 / Power regulator defends his record


   By MICHAEL SMITH


Professor Stephen Littlechild, director-general of the Office of Electricity
Regulation, said yesterday that regional electricity companies could raise
dividends by 6 per cent to 9 per cent annually in real terms in the next few
years.
He said in a strong defence of his record as regulator that criticism of the
price controls he announced on the companies' distribution businesses this
summer was misplaced.
His remarks on dividends surprised the City. Although the stock market is
expecting average dividend rises of about 8 per cent in the next few years,
analysts said it was unusual for a regulator to discuss dividend projections
in public.
Speaking at a London conference, Prof Littlechild said criticism based on
dividend projections failed to realise that the projections reflected the
profitability of the companies' unregulated businesses and the effect of
profits derived from existing controls.
Confiscating past profits would undermine the present basis of regulation
and reduce the incentive to improve efficiency, he said.
Prof Littlechild said part of the criticism resulted from 'misleading'
rumours about a confidential letter sent to the companies in April. The
significance of the letter had been misunderstood since it was not even a
preliminary proposal and 'did not reflect my view about what the proposal
should ultimately be'.
He said that in future price reviews he would consider making more
information public at intermediate stages of reviews, including a range of
price controls. The price controls, he said, were as severe as those of any
other utility and more severe than most.
The review, accepted by all the companies in England and Wales, will force
distribution price reductions of between 11 per cent and 17 per cent next
April.
