FT  23 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Managers buy remaining Survival shops


   By CHRIS TIGHE


THE SIX remaining shops of the collapsed Survival Group have been sold to
their managers in individual deals, joint administrators Buchler Phillips
Traynor said yesterday, writes Chris Tighe.
The six buy-outs, which will trade as separate entities, have bought stock,
fixtures and fittings and negotiations are in progress on their use of the
logo and trade names of the Survival Group.
The company, which was chaired by Mr John Ashcroft, former Coloroll group
chairman, went into administration in March with liabilities of Pounds 1.7m.
Buchler Phillips Traynor said that preferential creditors might receive a
small dividend; unsecured creditors, who are owed Pounds 1.5m, will receive
nothing.
Joint administrator Mr Ron Robinson said: 'The sale of outlets to their
respective managers was the best, if unusual, solution for Survival's
creditors and former employees'.
Mr Ashcroft and two partners bought a 72 per cent stake in Survival Aids,
subsequently renamed Survival Group, in 1990. It was his first acquisition
following Coloroll's collapse with debts of approximately Pounds 350m.
In March Mr Ashcroft said he held a minority interest in Survival Group, but
was its largest creditor.
