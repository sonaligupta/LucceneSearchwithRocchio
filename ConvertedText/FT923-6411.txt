FT  25 AUG 92 / Court told of fraud scheme


A BUSINESSMAN trying to stave off financial ruin siphoned more than Pounds
332,000 from the bank account of a firm of London solicitors, it was alleged
yesterday.
Mr Sean O'Reilly, who ran a business making sports trophies, denies
conspiracy to defraud.
Mr Howard Vagg, prosecuting at Southwark Crown Court, said Mr O'Reilly had
an unidentified accomplice. He explained that the scheme involved someone
posing as a partner in solicitors Asshetons and instructing its bank to
transfer the money from its client account to one of Mr O'Reilly's personal
accounts.
Asshetons discovered its account had been emptied, however, and obtained a
court order freezing further dealings.
It was clear that at least one other person, somebody with inside knowledge
of Asshetons, was involved in the fraud, Mr Vagg said. The trial continues.
