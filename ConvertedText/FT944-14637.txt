FT  21 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets: Industrials extend rally


The South African industrials sector moved ahead for the seventh consecutive
session as positive underlying sentiment remained in place, and local and
offshore investors vied for quality scrip.
Gold shares, however, came under pressure from the firmer financial rand
after a steady start, ending mixed as bullion's gain towards the close
provided only limited support. The industrials index rose 106 to 6,611,
taking its seven-day advance to 5.9 per cent. The overall index added 52 at
5,743 and golds put on 4 at 2,329.
Sappi extended recent hefty gains, firming R3 to a new high of R71. SAB rose
R2.65 to R90.15 amid foreign interest and Tiger Oats jumped R3 to R49. De
Beers was 75 cents better at R100.25 after a sluggish start, Anglos was 50
cents softer at R237.50 and JCI collected R2 at R106.
Stanbic appreciated R2 to R102 in an extension of Wednesday's R3.50 advance.
