FT  09 JUN 92 / Secret talks on Havel call for compromise


   From ARIANE GENILLARD


   PRAGUE


SECRECY yesterday surrounded plans for the first post-electoral meeting on
the future of the Czechoslovak federation.
Mr Vaclav Klaus, the federal finance minister and head of the Czech
delegation, is expected to meet Mr Vladimir Meciar, the Slovak leader, today
at an unknown venue somewhere between Prague and the Slovak capital,
Bratislava.
Mr Klaus was asked on Sunday night by the Czechoslovak president, Mr Vaclav
Havel, to begin negotiations to form a new federal government.
Mr Klaus and Mr Meciar will discuss the form of the future federal
government and the division of power between Czechs and Slovaks within it.
Mr Klaus has said he will reduce the federal government to a few key
ministries, such as finance, economics, foreign affairs and defence, but
this is likely to lead to clashes with the Slovaks, who want their republic
freed from federal control. The powers of the federal Finance Ministry will
be the subject of particularly fierce debate. Mr Klaus has said that fiscal
and economic policy must remain unified but Slovak nationalists have asked
for two central banks and said they intend to take full control over the
privatisation programme in their republic.
Mr Havel himself has seen his position as presidential candidate threatened
by the strong showing of the Slovak nationalist forces and the collapse of
the remnants of the Civic Movement which brought him to power after the 1989
revolution.
Mr Meciar said in Bratislava that he would ask his deputies in the federal
parliament to withdraw their support for Mr Havel's presidential
re-election. Other key policy makers, such as Mr Vladimir Dlouhy, the
federal economics minister, and Mr Jiri Dienstbier, the federal foreign
affairs minister, will not be able to help Mr Havel as their parties failed
to win any seats in parliament.
