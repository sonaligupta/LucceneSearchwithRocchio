FT  15 JUN 93 / Tecs warned on national links


   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff


TRAINING AND Enterprise Councils must forge better working relationships
with other employer organisations if targets for improving the skills of the
workforce are to be met, Mrs Sheila Drew-Smith of Coopers & Lybrand, the
accountancy firm, said at a training conference yesterday.
She was presenting a study on relations between the 82 Tecs, which deliver
government training schemes in England and Wales, and the 126 Industry
Training Organisations, which are national bodies focusing on particular
sectors.
When the government set up Tecs more than four years ago it wanted them to
work closely with the training organisations. They have information, for
example, on sectoral labour needs which the government believed could
provide a national perspective to Tecs, whose prime responsibility is to
respond to local labour markets.
The partnership has been patchy, however, with the organisations sometimes
complaining that Tecs have ignored them. Mrs Drew-Smith said the study
suggested that each set of organisations may not have perceived the value of
the other's role, or viewed the other as a potential threat.
Tecs had sometimes been seen by the training organisations as inexperienced
newcomers.
She said there was confusion about how they could collaborate to achieve
national targets for National Vocational Qualifications and Investors in
People, the government's main vehicle for improving the training of people
in work.
Mrs Drew-Smith who has prepared a checklist for Tecs and Industry Training
Organisations to see whether they are working effectively, said: 'This
situation cannot persist. We are dealing with scarce resources.'
