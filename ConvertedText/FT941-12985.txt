FT  27 JAN 94 / International Company News: Losses mount at Borden as
restructuring takes its toll


   By RICHARD TOMKINS


   NEW YORK


Borden, the troubled US food and wallpaper group which this month put
several of its businesses up for sale, yesterday announced the expected
heavy losses for its fourth quarter and the full year after taking heavy
charges for restructuring.
Net losses for the fourth quarter came to Dollars 635.9m, or Dollars 4.50 a
share, largely because the company took a charge of Dollars 632m against
earnings to cover losses stemming from business divestments, asset
write-downs, the cost of reorganisation, and accounting changes. Last year
it made net profits of Dollars 28.4m, or 20 cents.
For the full year, Borden reported net losses of Dollars 593.6m, or Dollars
4.21, compared with net losses of Dollars 439.6m, or Dollars 3.07.
At the beginning of January, Borden said it was putting its loss-making
salty snacks business and its seafood, jam and jelly businesses on the
market in the latest of a series of restructurings aimed at reviving
profits.
Mr Ervin Shames, president and chief executive, said yesterday he believed
the latest plan would improve Borden's performance.
'The key is revitalising our best businesses through a combination of focus,
investment in marketing, the largest cost reduction in Borden history, and a
management team operating in a re-energised culture,' Mr Shames said.
He predicted that quarterly earnings would strengthen this year after a
marginally profitable first quarter, producing year-end earnings per share
at the upper end of the 75 cents to Dollars 1 range predicted by analysts.
