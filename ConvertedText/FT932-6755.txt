FT  27 MAY 93 / Report on Thorp is passed to Howard


   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent


THE Pollution Inspectorate has passed its report on the public consultation
into British Nuclear Fuels' controversial Thorp reprocessing plant at
Sellafield to Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary.
Mr Howard is expected to take at least several weeks to review the 200-page
report on the 80,000 public responses, which was sent to the Department of
the Environment on Friday.
Department officials will meet to decide how to proceed within days. One
option is to decide the plant's future simply on the basis of the report.
The department, however, has received legal advice that it may need to
consider the wider economic and social case for Thorp to guard against legal
action by pressure groups. It is understood that the department has received
informal indications that further consultation might be advisable.
