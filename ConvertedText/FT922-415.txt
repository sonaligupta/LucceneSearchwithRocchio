FT  27 JUN 92 / Australian merger law


   By EMELIA TAGAZA


   CANBERRA


Australia is to introduce tougher merger laws and higher fines for
anti-competitive trading practices, reports Emelia Tagaza in Canberra.
Amendments to the Trade Practices Act are to be introduced in August,
including a dramatic rise in maximum penalties from ADollars 250,000 (Pounds
100,800) to ADollars 10m for companies, and from ADollars 50,000 to ADollars
500,000 for individuals. New legislation will allow the Trade Practices
Commission to block mergers and acquisitions that will substantially lessen
competition in a market.
