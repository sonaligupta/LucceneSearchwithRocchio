FT  19 APR 94 / NVQ pioneer to quit scheme


   By LISA WOOD


BHS, one of the UK's largest retailers, is to stop using the new
industry-wide National Vocational Qualifications and replace them with an
in-house training scheme, Lisa Wood writes.
Mr Kevin Heald, BHS national retail manager, said: 'There is nothing wrong
with NVQs, but they contain a set of generic skills. We want to develop
skills that are tailor-made to our own needs.'
The NVQ system seeks to establish a nationwide system of competence-based
qualifications. Some employers complain about the costs, some see NVQs as
too broad and others say they are too narrow.
The BHS move casts doubt on the training the industry itself helped to set
up, and the withdrawal of one of the qualifications' pioneers will concern
NVQ standard-setters.
BHS said about half its staff had the level one NVQ - the basic
qualification.
