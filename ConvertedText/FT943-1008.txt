FT  27 SEP 94 / Guatemala trade hopes threatened by labour claims

   WASHINGTON


Mr George Brown, the chairman of the Congressional working group on
international labour rights, is opposing a Clinton administration proposal
to ease pressure on Guatemala over its abuse of workers' rights.
Guatemala is a beneficiary of the Generalised System of Preferences, which
provides duty-free entry of developing country products to the US market. US
law requires that GSP benefits are not extended to countries which show no
progress in improving their workers' rights. Guatemala recently reformed
some labour practices, prompting Mr Mickey Kantor, US Trade Representative,
to consider relaxing the US stance on the country.
He is due to make a decision by by Friday.
However, the Organisation of American States last week heard testimony from
three Guatemalan workers, who claimed that violence against trade unionists
had increased in recent months.
In one alleged incident, workers occupied a plantation to draw attention to
the firing of 62 workers who had been demanding the legal minimum wage of
Dollars 2 (Pounds 1.25) a day.
They were forcibly evicted by an anti-riot squad, according to the three,
who testified in Washington. Three workers were killed, 11 were wounded, and
19 have disappeared. Mr Diego Orozco, who led the protest, died; witnesses
claimed he had been hurled from a helicopter.
Labour rights activists say Guatemala has failed some of its reform
promises. 'Not a single case of violence against trade unionists has been
prosecuted since . . . August 1991, let alone resulted in a conviction or
imprisonment,' Congressman Brown said in a letter to be sent to Mr Kantor.
Mr Kantor's decision may be delayed because the GSP programme is due to
lapse the same day the decision is due. Its renewal is attached to
legislation implementing the Uruguay Round.
