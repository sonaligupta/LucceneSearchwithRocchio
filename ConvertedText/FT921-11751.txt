year to Dollars 179m

USF&G, whose property/casualty operations rank about 13th in premium volume,
has turned in a fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 40m, or 62 cents a share,
reflecting the difficulties faced by many US insurers in 1991.
The loss compares with a fourth-quarter deficit of Dollars 610m, or Dollars
7.32 a share, in 1990. The 1991 figures include one-time gains of Dollars
16m, more than offset by one-time charges of Dollars 50m. Revenues eased to
Dollars 1.02bn from Dollars 1.17bn.
The company cut its fourth-quarter operating loss to Dollars 7m, or 23
cents, from Dollars 113m, or Dollars 1.40, in the previous year.
For the full year, USF&G's net loss was Dollars 179m, or 38 cents a share,
on revenues of Dollars 4.13bn compared with a deficit of Dollars 569m, or
Dollars 1.62, on revenues of Dollars 4.53bn in 1990.
USF&G said it had met its 1991 objective of strengthening its balance sheet,
cutting costs and sharpening its business focus.
Mr Norman Blake, chairman and chief executive, said the performance of the
property/casualty offshoot was particularly encouraging. 'Its fourth quarter
1991 operating income of Dollars 17m was the best since the second quarter
of 1990.'
