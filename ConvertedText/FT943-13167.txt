FT  21 JUL 94 / International Company News: McDonnell Douglas falls to
Dollars 138m


   By RICHARD TOMKINS


McDonnell Douglas, the US defence and aerospace group, reported a fall in
net earnings to Dollars 138m from Dollars 170m in its second quarter.
However, the figure represented a 22 per increase from Dollars 113m if
unusual items were stripped out of the previous year's figure.
The improvement was achieved in spite of a downturn in revenues caused by
poor demand for commercial aircraft and reduced activity in the missiles,
space and electronic systems segment. Group turnover fell by 15 per cent to
Dollars 3.25bn.
By cutting costs, McDonnell Douglas was able to increase operating profits
to Dollars 259m from Dollars 234m last year, excluding unusual items.
Earnings per share were Dollars 3.50, compared with Dollars 4.33 last time,
or Dollars 2.87 without unusual items.
The most profitable segment was military aircraft, which saw an 11 per cent
increase in revenues.
Operating profits rose to Dollars 153m from Dollars 118m.
Commercial aircraft revenues fell more than 40 per cent due to declining
demand.
The company delivered eight MD-80 twin-jets and four MD-11 tri-jets in the
second quarter, against 13 MD-80s and 10 MD-11s in the same period last
year.
However, the division lifted operating profits to Dollars 24m from Dollars
12m.
The missiles, space and electronic systems segment saw a 33 per cent decline
in revenues because of the company's reduced role in the space station
programme and the winding down of the advanced cruise missile programme.
Operating profits fell to Dollars 80m from Dollars 99m.
Cashflow from aerospace operations remained strong, allowing the company to
cut debt by more than Dollars 300m in the first six months to Dollars 1.3bn
at June 30.
Net income for the first six months was Dollars 272m, compared with Dollars
207m before unusual items and Dollars 386m after them.
