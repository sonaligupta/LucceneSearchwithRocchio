FT  18 APR 94 / Company News (This Week): Dividend payment on the cards -
Citicorp


Citicorp is expected to announce later today that it will begin paying a
dividend to shareholders again, finally putting behind it the traumas of the
early 1980s.
The bank suspended its dividend in October 1991, four months before it was
forced to enter a memorandum of understanding with banking regulators which
imposed limits on its financial and operational flexibility. The memorandum
was finally lifted last month, paving the way for a reinstatement of the
dividend when the bank's board meets this afternoon in New York.
Though it still lags US competitors in terms of capital strength, Citicorp
pushed its key tier one ratio above 6 per cent last year.
If it matched other banks' pay-out policies, it could reinstate the dividend
at around Dollars 1.50, says Mr Frank Suozo, banking analyst at SG Warburg
in New York. He adds, though, that the bank is more likely to pay an initial
80 cents-Dollars 1, leaving it room for increase in coming quarters.
Like other big money centre banks, Citi will report first-quarter results on
Tuesday. Several regionals announce figures today. The news is likely to be
good on the credit side, with further reductions in underperforming assets.
Net interest margins are also expected to have held up well.
