FT  28 MAR 92 / UK Company News: EMH shares suspended while talks proceed


   By ANDREW BOLGER


Shares in European Motor Holdings, the motor retail group formerly known as
Cargo Control, were suspended at 123p yesterday as the company said it was
in talks which might lead to it making a very substantial acquisition.
European Motor Holdings, which bought the motor retail division of Thomas
Robinson Group for Pounds 7.1m in November, incurred pre-tax losses of
Pounds 735,000 for the six months to September 30 on turnover of Pounds
3.7m. An announcement about the acquisition is expected on Monday.
