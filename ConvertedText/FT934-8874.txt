FT  13 NOV 93 / Magistrates accuse Corleone clan


   By REUTER


   ROME


SICILIAN magistrates said yesterday that bosses of the Mafia's Corleone clan
killed anti-Mafia judge Giovanni Falcone, his wife and three bodyguards in
May 1992, Reuter reports from Rome.
After sophisticated detective work, including DNA testing of saliva found on
discarded cigarette butts, they issued 18 arrest warrants for the car
bombing which outraged Italy.
'We are now in the position to identify each person and his role,' judge
Giovanni Tinebra of Caltanissetta, who led the inquiry, said.
Mr Falcone, a popular anti-Mafia crusader, was killed by a bomb as he was
being driven into the city of Palermo from the airport.
