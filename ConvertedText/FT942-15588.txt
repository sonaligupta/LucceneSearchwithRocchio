FT  14 APR 94 / UK Company News: Sims Food shares fall 21p on guarded
forecast


   By DAVID WIGHTON


Shares in Sims Food Group fell 21p to 82p yesterday after the meat processor
and supplier warned that it had been unable to pass on seasonal raw material
price increases to UK retailers.
In December, the company announced first half losses of Pounds 1.3m, which
it blamed on high livestock prices and the devaluation of sterling. The
interim dividend was cut by a third.
It said yesterday that management accounts showed a small pre-tax profit for
the year to March 31 as a whole.
In addition to the pressure on gross margins due to raw material price
increases, Sims said volumes had also suffered. Demand was flat,
particularly in the case of beef where recent publicity about the BSE
disease had had an effect.
However, the company continues to trade profitably with the full benefits of
last year's restructuring now being felt.
