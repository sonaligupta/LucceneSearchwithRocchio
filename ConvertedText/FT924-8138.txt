FT  12 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Canada in tough line on Nafta


   By BERNARD SIMON


   TORONTO


CANADA has joined Mexico in opposing any effort by President-elect Clinton
or the US Congress to alter the environmental and labour provisions of the
North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). A Canadian official indicated
Ottawa would prefer the incoming Democratic administration in Washington to
resolve its objections to Nafta in the framework of supplementary and
parallel agreements, including existing bilateral 'memoranda of
understanding' rather than by re-opening the Nafta deal.
Mr Clinton has expressed general support for the deal agreed by US, Canadian
and Mexican negotiators last August, but with the condition it includes
tighter rules on environment, workers' rights and health and safety
standards. President Bush gave the required 90 days' notice in early
September that he plans to sign the Nafta deal and submit it for
Congressional approval. The Democrat-controlled Congress is expected to
press the Clinton administration to obtain pledges from Mexico and Canada
that his concerns will be met.
