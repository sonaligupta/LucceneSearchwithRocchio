FT  08 NOV 93 / Back-to-basics plea from Major


   By JAMES BLITZ


THE PRIME MINISTER is seeking to create a coherent framework for
Conservative party policy over the coming months by putting a renewed
emphasis on his belief in restoring traditional social values.
Cabinet ministers have been invited to comment on a six-page letter which Mr
John Major sent them at the weekend, in which he calls for a return to
'common sense' in social policy areas such as education and law and order.
Mr Major has already made clear that the policy, which has been called 'back
to basics', will be the main theme of the new parliamentary session.
It is also clear that it will be at the heart of Conservative campaigning in
next year's local government elections.
By issuing the document, which will not be made public, Mr Major is also
asserting his authority over a cabinet which has been divided over key
aspects of social and economic policy in recent months.
In his speech to the Conservative party conference last month Mr Major spelt
out his belief that society needed to return to core values in law and order
and education. He also attacked the 'political correctness' that has been
associated with left-wing groups, while lauding 'common sense' and family
values.
Downing Street officials said that Mr Major's document was intended to be a
'ready reckoner' which ministers could use when asked about the 'back to
basics' philosophy at public meetings and in media interviews.
A further sign of the growing importance of basic values in the party's
policies came in a speech by Sir Norman Fowler, party chairman, at the
weekend, when he outlined their importance in next year's local elections.
He said: 'There is more sense in Hampshire than in Hampstead, in blue rinse
rather than Bloomsbury. We must follow John Major's lead and speak out for
those basic truths which must not be ignored.'
