FT  25 AUG 92 / Japanese win County Hall judicial review


   By ANDREW ADONIS


THE government will have to defend in the High Court its controversial
decision to allow the London School of Economics to bid for County Hall, the
landmark London site across the Thames from the Houses of Parliament.
The High Court yesterday gave Shirayama Corporation, the Japanese developer
which bought County Hall in March, the right to seek judicial review of the
decision last month by Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, to
allow the social science university to mount a counter bid.
That decision angered Shirayama, which believed an 'opt-out' clause in its
purchase agreement with the London Residuary Body, the owner of the site on
behalf of the London boroughs, would be exercised only if Labour won this
year's general election.
The LSE's interest in the site was well known when Mr Michael Heseltine,
then environment secretary, sanctioned the LRB sale to Shirayama. But last
month Mr Howard decided to allow the LSE to bid and ordered the LRB not to
proceed without his consent.
The LRB is strongly opposed to the LSE's counter bid, describing it earlier
this month as 'highly speculative and not worth serious consideration'.
Mr Justice Otton, granting Shirayama permission to seek judicial review,
said the developer had an 'arguable case' that Mr Howard was exceeding his
statutory powers in issuing his order.
Shirayama, which proposes to convert County Hall into a luxury 600-bed
hotel, paid about Pounds 60m for the building. The LSE is offering Pounds
65m for the Hall and its surrounding site. It wants to relocate from its
cramped premises off Aldwych and create a 'social science park' as part of
its plan to promote itself as 'Europe's social science university'.
The cabinet is known to be split on the merits of the LSE's bid. A final
decision is expected in early September.
