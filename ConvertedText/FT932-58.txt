FT  30 JUN 93 / Government Bonds: US prices little changed on weak economic
data


   By PATRICK HARVERSON and PETER JOHN


   NEW YORK, LONDON


A SERIES of data showing sustained weakness in the economy failed to lift
longer-dated US Treasury prices yesterday, but yields remained close to
record levels.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  3/32 at 105
25/32 , yielding 6.672 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was up  3/32 at 100 7/32 , to yield 3.994 per cent.
The economic news was bullish for bonds. May leading indicators fell 0.3 per
cent, while new home sales were down 21 per cent, a much bigger fall than
analysts had expected.
Also, the Conference Board's index of consumer confidence fell to 58.9 per
cent in June, down from 61.9 per cent - the sixth time in the seven months
since the presidential election that confidence has fallen.
The news cheered fixed-income investors but it was only at the short end
that prices responded. At the long end, where yields fell on Monday to
record levels, prices firmed in early trading but dropped back later amid
profit-taking. Dealers said demand for longer-dated securities was
temporarily exhausted after Monday's big gains.
UK GOVERNMENT bonds eased yesterday as traders prepared their books for
today's record auction of gilt-edged stock, which is expected to generate
substantial overseas interest.
The Bank of England is selling Pounds 3.25bn of 10-year bonds carrying an 8
per cent coupon, and the auction, which increases an existing issue to
around Pounds 7bn, is expected to be very tightly bid.
The auction comes at a time when the combination of low inflationary
pressures, slow recovery and a strengthening pound makes UK paper
particularly attractive to overseas investors.
Economists estimate that around 20 per cent of gilt investment is now held
overseas, with the bulk in the 10 to 15-year range, and dealers said
yesterday that there was strong interest from overseas, especially Japanese
investors who were preparing to sell dollars in order to buy gilts.
The feeling in UK trading rooms was that if the auction was covered more
than 1.5 times it would be considered a success.
Medium-dated issues slipped back as dealers ensured that they were short of
stock ahead of the issue and the key 10-year gilt that is being auctioned
today fell  5/32 to 102 7/32 . Short-dated issues were steady and
index-linked gilts, which have been left behind recently as the market
concentrated on conventional issues, bounced smartly.
THE LATE announcement of a German budget package and its possible
implications for an interest rate cut gave a brief fillip to government
bonds, which had been trading disinterestedly.
However, bund prices were unable to sustain the rally that briefly followed
the announcement of DM20bn of spending cuts.
Bund futures for September opened at 95.76 and had drifted downwards in
early trading as hopes of a rate cut at tomorrow's Bundesbank council
meeting receded.
When the news of the budget package came through, the contract sparked ahead
to 95.90 but by the close it had been taken down again to close 0.02 lower
on the day at 95.74.
Belgian bonds picked up on German rate cut hopes and at the weekly T-bill
auction the average rate on three-month T-bills fell to 6.68 per cent from
6.80 per cent.
FRENCH government bonds were easier ahead of a FFr17bn to FFr19bn OATs
auction tomorrow and the yield spread between French and German 10-year
issues widened slightly.
On the Matif, the September futures contract had been strongly through 120
in overnight trading but it was unable to hold that level and came back
during official trading hours to close 0.10 lower at 119.82.
IN THE high-yielding government bond markets, Italy bounced 0.40 to 102.63
in the September futures contract while Spain traded sideways ahead of an
auction today of one-year paper and an auction tomorrow of three-year,
five-year and 10-year Bonos.
THE JAPANESE bond market focused on the prospect of heavy supply, due to the
announcement of a seven-year Y225bn global bond issue from the World Bank,
with the benchmark No 145 easing 10 basis points to 106.96.
