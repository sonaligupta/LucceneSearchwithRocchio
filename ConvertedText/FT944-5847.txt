FT  01 DEC 94 / International Company News: CRA closes Port Kembla refinery


   By NIKKI TAIT


CRA, the Australian mining group, and its partners in the Southern Copper
consortium, announced yesterday that they had decided to close the refinery
and smelter at Port Kembla, in New South Wales.
The move was foreshadowed a month ago, when CRA, which holds a 60 per cent
interest in the project, said it would not support an upgrade of the
facility unless a new partner was brought in to reduce 'substantially' its
stake. The other two existing partners in Southern Copper are Japanese -
Furukawa with 30 per cent, and Nissho Iwai with 10 per cent.
The plant has seen strike action recently, with employees protesting at job
cuts. But CRA said the closure decision was based on consistently poor
financial performance since 1991, a bleak short-term outlook, and the
reluctance of shareholders to support further capital expenditure needed for
environmental upgrading.
It added that during a period of care and maintenance, efforts to find a new
equity partner would continue. The plant employs around 440 people.
