FT  14 APR 94 / Cigarette makers reveal ingredients


   By RICHARD TOMKINS


   NEW YORK


The six biggest cigarette manufacturers in the US yesterday surprised the
tobacco industry by publishing the secret list of ingredients they add to
cigarettes to improve flavour, taste and aroma.
The list shows that, after tobacco, the primary ingredients of most US
cigarettes - comprising about 10 per cent of the total by weight - are
water, sugars, glycerin, propylene glycol, licorice, cocoa, and other
flavourings.
The manufacturers' decision to publish the list follows a broadcast last
week by US National Public Radio, claiming US cigarettes contained 13
ingredients that were unsafe because they were not in the US Food and Drug
Administration's list of approved food additives.
Earlier the US TV network ABC had aired a current affairs programme claiming
that Philip Morris, manufacturer of Marlboro cigarettes, was adding extra
nicotine to its cigarettes to make them more addictive.
Yesterday RJ Reynolds Tobacco, part of the RJR Nabisco group, said an
independent scientific panel had established that the ingredients added to
cigarettes were virtually the same as those found in everyday foods and were
'not hazardous under conditions of use'.
Of the 13 ingredients identified by National Public Radio, five were not
used by any of the six leading US manufacturers.
The others were either not detectable in the finished product, approved by
the FDA in other forms, or occurred naturally in foodstuffs ranging from
coffee to kiwifruit and grapefruit juice.
