FT  11 MAR 93 / French cabinet backs reform of constitution


   By DAVID BUCHAN


   PARIS


THE French government yesterday put its stamp of approval on President
Francois Mitterrand's proposed constitutional reform aimed at giving
France's legislature and judiciary more independence from its executive.
The proposals, which will go to parliament for discussion after this month's
elections, are designed to boost the powers of scrutiny of the relatively
weak National Assembly as well as to give it more leeway to organise its own
business.
However, it proposes that parliament should sit for a single session from
October to June each year rather than its current two sessions of 90 days
each.
The only mildly controversial element is Mr Mitterrand's call for the
scrapping of Article 16 which gives a president extraordinary powers in a
national emergency.
The Conseil d'Etat, which advises the government on constitutional matters,
counselled against abolishing this article, even though it has only been
used once - by General de Gaulle during the Algerian troubles in the early
1960s.
In the present political climate virtually the only constitutional issue of
interest to most French is the president's term of office.
Mr Mitterrand had hinted that he might call for presidential terms to be
shortened from seven years, or made non-renewable.
However, the plan approved yesterday follows an early advisory committee in
recommending no change to this issue which has sparked wide political
debate.
The Union for French Democracy (UDF), led by ex-President Valery Giscard
d'Estaing who believes in reducing the tenure of a French president,
yesterday took for the first time a slight lead over its Republican Rally
(RPR) Gaullist ally in an opinion poll.
An IFOP survey gave the UDF 20 per cent, the RPR 19.5 per cent, with the
ruling Socialist party trailing at 22 per cent.
