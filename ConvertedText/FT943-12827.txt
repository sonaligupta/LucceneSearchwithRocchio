FT  22 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Sime Darby sets its sights on Europe with
purchase of Lec


   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY


Sime Darby, the Malaysia-based conglomerate and one of south-east Asia's
biggest multinationals, announced its first foray into manufacturing in
Europe with the proposed acquisition of Lec Refrigeration, the West
Sussex-based refrigeration equipment manufacturer.
Lec's main shareholders with 51.97 per cent of its equity, including the
trustees of the estate of Mr Charles Purley, the company's founder, the
trustees of the Purley Family Trust, and Candy Holdings, have accepted the
cash offer of 358p per share, which values the company at Pounds 21.7m.
The offer represents a premium of 21.4 per cent over the middle market price
of 295p per Lec share.
Mr Nik Mohamed, group chief executive of Sime Darby, said Lec's white goods
brand name would complement the company's operations and provide it with
manufacturing capacity in Europe. He added that Sime's financial resources
would enable Lec to expand its product range and penetrate new markets.
Mr Don Durrant, Lec finance director, said the deal would allow Lec to
implement its planned Pounds 13m investment in new plant and machinery over
the next three years.
Lec reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 838,000 in 1993 against losses of
Pounds 2.86m the previous year on turnover of Pounds 37m (Pounds 41m). It
employs 930 workers.
Although Sime has extensive international exposure, including divisions in
Malaysia, Hong Kong, Singapore, the Philippines and Australia, the
acquisition provides it with its first manufacturing base in Europe.
Sime operates 200 companies, employing 30,000 people worldwide. It reported
pre-tax profits of MDollars 840m (Pounds 215m) against MDollars 755m on
turnover of MDollars 7bn (MDollars 6.2bn) in the year to June 30 1993.
