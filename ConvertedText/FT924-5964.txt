FT  24 NOV 92 / Letter: Tax relief for care of elderly


   From Ms CAROLINE MONTAGU


Sir, The points in your article 'The wealth cascade runs dry' (November 21)
are chillingly clear to many of the now middle aged baby-boomers. The
parents of this group, often both still alive and wishing to continue living
at home together, can easily wipe out their own assets to support
themselves. In many cases, where elderly couples try to continue to live in
their own house, income topped up by capital injections does not begin to
meet their nursing or caring costs.
This shortfall must often be met by subventions from their children at a
time when they are still financially supporting their own offspring. These
contributions can be very high and sudden, and, except for the very
fortunate, usually have to come from income after tax. For members of this
group whose parents have escalating care costs the idea of the 'wealth
cascade' has long been consigned to the dustbin.
Given the current policy of Care in the Community, would it not be
appropriate for the government to consider a means whereby those children
financially supporting their elderly parents could obtain some income tax
relief?
