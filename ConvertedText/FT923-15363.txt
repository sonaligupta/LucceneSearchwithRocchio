FT  02 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Ashdown calls for EC-wide vote


   By ALISON SMITH


A COMMUNITY-WIDE referendum on constitutional proposals reached on the basis
of majority voting was suggested yesterday by Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal
Democrat leader, as one possibility for decision-making on the future of
Europe, Alison Smith writes.
He suggested that in the longer term the EC might want to move towards more
qualified majority voting and away from unanimity, with the proviso that
decisions should be supported by a majority in the European parliament and
by an EC-wide referendum. That route would prevent a single country from
being able to veto change, while securing a greater democratic endorsement
of any changes that were agreed.
An overall threshold of perhaps 60 per cent or 65 per cent would be needed
to approve changes, and there would also have to be some way of ensuring
that the smaller countries were not simply outvoted.
Mr Ashdown will take up the theme today, in a speech to European Liberals
and Reformists in Copenhagen, saying such a referendum might follow a
European constitutional convention, already proposed by the Liberal
Democrats.
Yesterday he also called on Mr John Major to take a tougher line with Tory
Euro-sceptics, by putting a motion to MPs before the summer, so that
parliament as well as the government could reaffirm its commitment to
Maastricht.
