FT  15 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Quality standard good discipline


   From Mr RICHARD HASLER


Sir, As a quality management consultant dealing with a large number of small
professional practices, I agree with many of the concerns expressed in your
article, 'Seeking credibility for quality standards' (April 12). It is a
fact that many small firms are being forced by their clients to comply with
BS 5750, and of course they will be looking to achieve certification as
simply and quickly as they can.
However, almost without exception, our clients have found that the
discipline imposed by formalising procedures and the feed-back and review
stipulated by the standard have led to improvements to internal management
efficiency and to the quality of service being provided.
