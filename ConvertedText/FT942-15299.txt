Market Report


   By REUTER


London OIL futures yesterday hit 1994 peaks in a rally sparked mostly by
tighter North Sea supplies and brisk demand. At the International Petroleum
Exchange May delivery Brent Blend traded up to Dollars 15.15 a barrel, the
highest for a prompt contract since November 24 and the first time it had
topped Dollars 15 since February 3.
COFFEE prices remained weak throughout the day at the London Commodity
Exchange, the second month ending at the day's lows in an expected
correction following recent strong gains.
London Metal Exchange ALUMINIUM prices broke lower but just about managed to
hold above a Dollars 1,305 a tonne for three months delivery as Chinese
interest continued to appear on price dips. The price closed at Dollars
1,308 a tonne, down Dollars 8 on the day.
NICKEL prices bounced smartly in the afternoon, with the market capitalising
on good downside support below Dollars 5,600 a tonne, virtually to erase
early losses.
LEAD prices collapsed during the after hours 'kerb' session, with stop-loss
selling orders triggered below Dollars 460 a tonne, following Wednesday's
failure above Dollars 470.
