FT  30 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Pacific Rim produces a
bevy of new highs


   By EMIKO TERAZONO


   TOKYO


SHARE PRICES were supported by public and arbitrage fund buying and the
Nikkei average advanced by 1.1 per cent after three consecutive days of
declines, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index rose 223.52 to 19,702.97 after a low of 19,500.95 and a
high of 19,744.27. The index, which had lost 4.1 per cent during the past
three trading days, rose in tandem with the futures market on index-linked
buying, and ended the week down 2.7 per cent.
Volume was 280m shares up from 235.5m and advances led declines by 709 to
266 with 146 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks
rose 28.20, or 1.8 per cent to 1,630.59, its first gain in 10 days. In
London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.23 to 1,296.42.
Confidence was also supported as the slide in East Japan Railway abated
somewhat, with the shares closing down Y5,000 at Y520,000, having initially
fallen to Y500,000.
Buying interest concentrated on large capital issues and high-technology
blue chips. Hitachi, the day's most active issue, rose Y24 to Y861, while
NEC gained Y20 to Y951. Nippon Steel added Y14 to Y334 and Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries Y30 to Y675.
Consumer electronics gained ground, with Matsushita Electric Industrial up
Y30 to Y1,470 and Sony gaining Y70 to Y4,920. However, Pioneer Electronic
fell Y20 to Y2,770 on prospects of weak earnings.
Banks recovered some of Thursday's losses: Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank rose Y80 to
Y2,400 and Sakura Bank Y50 to Y1,680.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone declined to Y810,000 in early afternoon, but
later trimmed its losses to Y1,000 closing at Y831,000.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 235.29 to 21,621.65 in volume of 14.1m
shares.
Roundup
RECORD highs were the order of the regional day.
HONG KONG continued to ignore Sino-British differences over political
reform, the Hang Seng index closing 318.82, or 3.5 per cent higher at
9,329.09, 7 per cent up on the week.
Turnover hit an estimated HKDollars 9.72bn, up from HKDollars 6.83bn on
Thursday, and Jardine Matheson, seen as sensitive to Sino-British friction,
climbed HKDollars 3.00 to HKDollars 74.00.
AUSTRALIA broke through 2,100 on the All Ordinaries index to close at
2,112.2, up 35.9 on the day, 2.5 per cent better on the week, and at its
highest in 6 years. Turnover soared, from ADollars 398.2m to ADollars
908.5m.
Good corporate prospects, and the possibility of lower interest rates after
a modest 0.5 per cent rise in September quarter inflation lent support, and
offshore buyers looking for quality stocks drove BHP up 52 cents to ADollars
17.70, CRA up 60 cents to ADollars 16.34, and News Corp by 36 cents to
ADollars 11.50.
NEW ZEALAND chalked up its sixth successive gain and a four year high in the
NZSE-40 index which closed 28.59 higher at 2,159.77, 2.9 per cent higher on
the week. There was heavy trading across the board, but especially in the
market leaders, Brierley, Carter Holt and Telecom.
KUALA LUMPUR reached its new peak on strong foreign demand for Telekom,
which drove the KLSE composite index up 25.24 to 971.99, 4.1 per cent up on
the week. Telekom registered a high of MDollars 22.00 before closing at
MDollars 21.60, up MDollars 1.70.
BANGKOK and MANILA hit their highs in spite of profit taking, the SET index
putting on 21.73 to 1,260.91, 9.7 per cent higher on the week, and the
Manila composite 46.23 to 2,372.83 for a week's gain of 4.9 per cent.
TAIWAN, still well below April's high, rose only 20.30 to 4,086.17 on the
SEC's proposed removal of ceilings on foreign investment in individual
stocks.
BOMBAY's BSE index fell 31.4 to 2,667.9, 1.9 per cent down on the week, as
fears remained of a political crisis in Kashmir.
