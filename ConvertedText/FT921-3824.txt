FT  12 MAR 92 / Brussels points to benefits of regional aid


   By DAVID BUCHAN


   BRUSSELS


Out of every Ecu100 (Pounds 71) worth of EC economic aid going to poorer
Community states, some Ecu20-45 returns to richer donor states in the form
of contracts for their industry, an EC commissioner said yesterday. David
Buchan reports from Brussels.
Mr Henning Christophersen, who is responsible for co-ordination of EC
structural funds, was presenting a review of the Community's internal
economic aid programme for 1989-93. He said the Ecu60bn which the EC's
regional, social and agricultural funds will have spent over that period
would create 500,000 jobs, chiefly in Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Greece.
Many northern member states are baulking at the Commission's proposal that
structural aid to poorer EC regions be raised, from Ecu18.5bn this year to
Ecu29.3bn by 1997.
