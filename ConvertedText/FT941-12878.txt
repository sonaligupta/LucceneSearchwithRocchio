FT  28 JAN 94 / Case of deja vu on EU travel


   By ALAN CANE


The row over the most recent delay in implementing the computer system
underpinning the Schengen free-travel accord reeks of deja vu to those
involved in sophisticated information technology projects. The technology is
rarely at fault; the management usually has a lot to answer for.
In this case the failure to appoint a prime contractor has led to an
acrimonious squabble over responsibility for coordination of the project.
The row is over the failure of the nine European Union signatories of the
Schengen accord to meet a February 1 target for ending passport controls.
The Schengen system is simple in essence. A central computer in Strasbourg
holds police and immigration records. Officials in the nine member countries
of the Schengen accord - the UK, Denmark and Ireland have excluded
themselves - have access to the information over telecommunications links.
The technology is tried and tested. Siemens Nixdorf, the German computer
manufacturer, is initially providing one, then a pair of mainframe computers
to manage the central records.
Bull, the French computer manufacturer, is providing the telecommunications
infrastructure, and Sema Group, the Anglo-French computing services company,
is developing the applications software. It also takes overall
responsibility for the system.
Each of the nine countries has responsibility for developing its own system,
linking police and immigration authorities, and ensuring it is ready for
connection to Strasbourg.
It is not much of a challenge by modern computing standards, yet the system
has been delayed repeatedly and now is certain to miss the most recent
target date of February 1 for ending passport controls.
If the present rate of progress is maintained, it could be 12 months before
the system is ready. Even when the links are established, each national
system will have to be thoroughly tested.
What has gone wrong and, more important, why? Everybody agrees the central
system is in good shape and has been for some months.
The problem is that the essential links between the central system and the
national systems are not all ready. Until the links are in place, system
testing is impossible. At least three national systems must be connected if
the system is to be tested realistically.
So far Belgium and the Netherlands have their links in place; France is
expected to follow. Germany, however, is not ready to connect. Who is at
fault? The Schengen authorities yesterday blamed Sema, arguing that it was
contractually obliged to provide the linking software. Sema rejected the
criticism.
Europe still seems to have some lessons to learn in project management.
Schengen is not an episode to promote confidence that the EU can co-ordinate
its efforts to create information superhighways or other large information
technology systems.
