FT  12 APR 94 / UK Company News: London and Manchester sharply ahead to
Pounds 33.4m


   By ALISON SMITH


London and Manchester, the life assurance and financial services group,
announced pre-tax profits ahead from Pounds 23.4m to Pounds 33.4m over the
1993 year, helped by a sharp turnaround in non-core activities.
These non-insurance businesses - covering areas such as consumer finance,
mort-gage lending and a property agency - contributed Pounds 2.5m, against
losses of Pounds 6.5m last time.
The greatest change was in the mortgage business, which achieved trading
profits of Pounds 846,000 (losses of Pounds 3.7m), despite a Pounds 300,000
increase to Pounds 9.7m in provisions for bad and doubtful debts.
Profits from insurance activities, including a transfer of Pounds 20.6m from
the life revenue account, came to Pounds 32m: comparable figures last time
were Pounds 19.3m and Pounds 30.7m. Within this area, however, there was a
fall of 25 per cent in new industrial branch business, where premiums are
collected weekly from customers' homes.
While there was a 40 per cent rise in new regular premium business won by
the direct sales force, which operates from the 37-branch network
established in 1992, there was a drop of almost one third in regular premium
new business through firms acting as appointed representatives.
Mr Tom Pyne, chief executive, said the reduction was largely because ties
had been broken with a number of companies, either because the amount of
business generated was not worth the investment by the group, or because the
group was not satisfied with the standards of selling. Appointed
representatives now number about 200 - against a maximum of 600 - though the
group intended to rebuild the total.
A final dividend of 10.56p is recommended, taking the total to 15.68p
(14.25p). Earnings per share rose to 20.49p (14.3p).
