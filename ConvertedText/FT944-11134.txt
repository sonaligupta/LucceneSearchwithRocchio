FT  08 NOV 94 / Labour cautious on coal policy


   By MICHAEL SMITH


Labour does not intend to renationalise the coal industry, Mr Martin
O'Neill, shadow energy minister, said yesterday, apparently contradicting
previous party statements.
Last year's party conference backed a motion seeking to renationalise the
industry. Mr Robin Cook, former shadow trade secretary, told parliament in
March he would be 'astonished if our plans to rescue the coal industry did
not involve public ownership'.
But party leaders have never been comfortable with the policy, particularly
since the election of Mr Tony Blair. Mr O'Neill said yesterday that Labour
was not in the business of 'making blanket promises to renationalise'.
Speaking to the monthly meeting of the Coal Industry Society, Mr O'Neill
said that if any of the companies which are buying British Coal's mines got
into difficulties, 'government would have to look afresh at the question of
ownership.
'We will intervene at any time we feel that safety is endangered,' he said.
Fleshing out the leadership's thoughts on energy, Mr O'Neill said: 'We will
have to keep at arm's length those who advocate a particular kind of energy,
nuclear or gas or coal, because they see it as a job-creation scheme.'
He added: 'Worthy though such an approach may be, if it is at the expense of
other more valuable resources or in conflict with other more compelling
priorities we will have to make this abundantly clear.'
