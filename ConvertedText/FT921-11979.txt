FT  29 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei gains 1.8% on
index-related buying


   By EMIKO TERAZONO


   TOKYO


SHARE PRICES gained ground on index-related activity and the Nikkei average
advanced 1.8 per cent, in spite of a lack of general buying interest, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average ended 383.41 ahead at 21,390.52, after opening at the
day's low of 21,027.66 and touching the session's high of 21,420.78 in the
afternoon.
Volume rose marginally to 160m shares from 137m, as small-lot bargain
hunting supported activity. Advances outnumbered declines for the first time
since last Wednesday, by 548 to 350, with 203 issues remaining unchanged.
However, activity centred around the Nikkei's 225 component stocks, and in
spite of the sharp rise in the Nikkei, the Topix index of all first section
stocks added only 9.0 at 1,583.47. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was
just 1.41 firmer at 1,220.12.
An analyst at Daiwa Securities commented: 'Trading was futures-related, and
there was no real demand.' Small-capital component stocks in the Nikkei 225
average surged, with Godo Shusei gaining Y210 or 11.1 per cent to Y2,090.
Reports that the Osaka Stock Exchange was considering disclosure of stock
futures transactions and shortening futures trading hours lifted the futures
market in the afternoon. Traders said market participants expected the
measures to increase transparency in the futures market. However, an OSE
official said an official decision had yet to be made on such moves.
Small-lot bargain hunting by foreign investors was noted. Mr Nick Cant at
Baring Securities said foreigners had shifted buying from interest
rate-sensitive issues, such as banks and real estate, to export-related
high-technology stocks.
Issues which had previously firmed on lower interest rates lost ground on
profit-taking. Mitsui Real Estate retreated Y40 to Y1,220 and Tokyo Electric
Power shed Y10 to Y3,140. However, some electricals saw support, Hitachi
gaining Y10 to Y920 and Matsushita Electric Industrial also Y10 to Y1,430.
Ono Pharmaceutical moved ahead Y500 to Y5,380 in Osaka on reports of its
plan to launch a new diabetic drug. Buying spread to other drug issues and
food companies involved in bio-technological research and development.
Takeda Chemical added Y20 at Y1,250 and Meiji Milk Products climbed Y54 to
Y880.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone was unaffected by the overall positive tone
of the market, and finished Y2,000 weaker at another all-time low of
Y680,000.
In Osaka, the OSE average put on 201.99 to 22,704.90 in volume of 51.1m
shares. Activity was dominated by large-lot cross-trading by companies and
banks, which wanted to realise gains on their stock holdings ahead of the
March book closing; but some buying by individuals and foreigners was noted.
Roundup
PROFIT-TAKING remained the dominant factor ahead of next week's Chinese new
year.
HONG KONG saw selective local selling after the Hang Seng index failed to
break through the 4,600 level again. The index, nevertheless, closed 31.60
stronger at 4,586.33, in turnover a shade higher at HKDollars 2.05bn.
While profit-taking was seen in Cheung Kong, the real estate sector still
had its supporters. Hongkong Land was among the most active stocks as it
rose 35 cents to HKDollars 10.30.
SINGAPORE reported pressure on blue chips as the Straits Times Industrial
index shed 7.64 to 1,538.28. Initial gains disappeared as buyers withdrew to
await the State of the Union address last night from the US president, Mr
George Bush.
KUALA LUMPUR eased as investors remained cautious about taking positions
ahead of the holiday next week. The composite index ended 0.71 off at 569.84
after an early high of 571.17. Gains in Tokyo and a steady Wall Street
overnight prompted some bargain hunting at the outset.
SEOUL ended a two-day advance with the composite index pulling back 9.15 to
665.96 in turnover of Won417bn (Won537bn). Selling was aimed at large
manufacturing, financial, trading and construction stocks.
TAIWAN eased moderately from its 1992 high, the weighted index losing 28.82
to 5,312.67 as turnover decreased from TDollars 60.8bn to TDollars 49.8bn,
but observers said sentiment was still optimistic, reflecting a healthy
economy and a stable political situation.
AUSTRALIA rose after recovering from the sale of a large UK portfolio worth
some ADollars 20m. The sale caused a slight weakness but the market
recovered steadily during afternoon trading. The All Ordinaries index gained
10.1 to 1,626. Food group Goodman Fielder Wattie registered the highest
volume of 9.4m shares after a parcel of 7m shares worth more than ADollars
10m was placed by New Zealand Dairy.
NEW ZEALAND undid three days of gentle rises to close lower and subdued in a
market where most leaders were pegged back on reasonable volume. The NZSE-40
index receded 10.21 to 1,476.80 in turnover of some NZDollars 28.5m.
BANGKOK saw profit-taking, the SET index closing 5.20 down at 766.73 in
turnover of Bt6.51bn. Property and finance shares were active.
KARACHI dropped another 3 per cent, the KSE 100 index ending 46.32 lower at
1,442.31.
