FT  29 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Ashtead declines to Pounds 2.27m despite
maintaining volumes


   By PETER PEARSE


WITHIN THE context of the declining construction market, Ashtead Group saw
pre-tax profits shrink from Pounds 4.01m to Pounds 2.27m in the year to
April 30.
However, the equipment rental company maintained its final dividend at
3.025p for an unchanged total of 4.125p, and insisted that it had not been
necessary to 'adopt a short-term siege mentality'.
The shares, however, dropped 18p to 120p.
Both Mr Peter Lewis, chairman, and Mr George Burnett, managing director,
said they were proud of the strength of the balance sheet.
At the same time they were aware of the need to avoid complacency in a
sector which has seen more than 200 plant hire outlets close in the year.
Pricing, said Mr Burnett, had fallen by between 25 per cent and 30 per cent
in the past three years, especially in the hard hit south-east of England.
Volumes had held up and there had been some gain in market share as other
companies had gone to the wall.
Mr Lewis said, however, that the company had avoided the pursuit of turnover
for its own sake.
'This year we've walked away from more business than we've ever done,' said
Mr Burnett.
Ashtead had withdrawn, at the end of 1991, from an acquisition which would
have made it 'the largest player at one bound'. Having stalked the
loss-making target, 'a significant subsidiary of a larger parent', for three
years, it was put off the deal simply by external economic conditions.
'We needed some help from the market place and there wasn't any,' said Mr
Lewis.
He added that none of Ashtead's quoted rivals have made substantial
acquisitions. The due diligence costs of Pounds 65,000 were taken as an
exceptional charge.
As a result, proceeds of April 1991's Pounds 5.8m rights issue reduced
borrowings to Pounds 8.51m (Pounds 14.1m) giving gearing of 43 per cent (72
per cent).
The strength of the balance sheet allowed the company to spend Pounds 7.8m
(Pounds 8.5m) on capital expenditure.
Group turnover slipped to Pounds 30.8m (Pounds 31.4m) and operating profits
to Pounds 3.45m (Pounds 5.91m). The interest charge fell to Pounds 1.12m
(Pounds 1.9m).
Earnings declined to 7.2p (13.9p) per share.
