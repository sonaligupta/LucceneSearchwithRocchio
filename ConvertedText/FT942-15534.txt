Paramount Publishing, the largest US book publisher, has formed a joint
venture with Davidson & Associates, a leading multimedia computer software
company. The alliance is the latest move by a traditional publisher to
branch into the emerging multimedia field.
The companies said they would develop a broad range of multimedia products
for the consumer, education, business and reference works markets, based on
Paramount's extensive library of book titles.
As part of the alliance, Davidson will develop education software for
schools to be marketed in conjunction with Paramount's school textbooks.
Paramount expects to initially spend Dollars 50m on the development of these
products, which it will own.
The companies are also entering into a joint venture to create and publish a
range of multimedia products under a Simon & Schuster/Davidson imprint for
other market segments. In the joint venture, the companies will equally
share investments and revenues.
'This alliance is an important step in our evolution into the largest
interactive publisher,' said Mr Richard Snyder, chairman of Paramount
Publishing, a division of Paramount Communications, which is being acquired
by Viacom. 'This new relationship will accelerate our efforts to exploit our
vast library of copyrights by creating multimedia products for the entire
publishing spectrum.'
