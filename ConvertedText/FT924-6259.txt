FT  21 NOV 92 / Schlesinger firm on interest rates


   By DAVID WALLER


   FRANKFURT


MINIMAL room exists for manoeuvre on German interest rates, Mr Helmut
Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, warned yesterday, in remarks which will
dampen widespread hopes of a cut in German rates this year, David Waller
writes from Frankfurt.
Speaking at the European Banking Congress in Frankfurt he emphasised that
the Bundesbank's policy was aimed at medium-term price stability, cautioning
that this goal was being challenged by sharply growing money supply, strong
credit growth, considerable price rises and the weakening of the D-Mark
against the US dollar.
His speech also contained a highly sceptical assessment of the path to
monetary union as outlined in the Maastricht treaty. He said that monetary
union was desirable and realisable - but not necessarily within the
timetable laid down in the treaty.
The Bundesbank's policymaking Council meets only twice more this year, on
Thursday next week and again on December 10, when a money supply target will
be set for next year. Any decision on whether to cut the key Lombard or
discount rates will be influenced by provisional data for October money
supply growth and November inflation, to be published next week.
The Lombard rate is currently 9.5 per cent, cut from 9.75 per cent in
mid-September.
