FT  12 APR 94 / UK Company News: Trafalgar House sells Dukes Hotel


   By SIMON DAVIES


Trafalgar House has sold the smallest of its three London hotels, the
64-room Dukes Hotel in St James Park. The price was not disclosed, but it is
understood to be at a small premium to the property's book value of some
Pounds 10m.
Dukes has been sold to Franklin Hotels, which already owns the Egerton House
and Franklin Hotel in Knightsbridge. The hotel had been up for sale for some
time.
It is understood that initial discussions have also taken place for the sale
of Trafalgar's Stafford Hotel, but its flagship property, the Ritz, was
taken off the market last year, as offers did not come close to 'acceptable'
levels.
Franklin's acquisition has been accompanied by a financial restructuring
undertaken with Hambro European Ventures.
As a result, Hambro will emerge with a 75 per cent stake in the enlarged
hotel company. Mr Jeremy Hand, of Hambro, said the enlarged Franklin group
would have Pounds 24m in debt and equity financing (the founders retain 25
per cent).
