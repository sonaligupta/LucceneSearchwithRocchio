FT  03 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Japanese silk industry to cut
production


   By REUTER


   TOKYO


Japan's silk industry organisation plans to cut production and build up
stocks to help support prices, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
Nihon Kikai Seishi Kougyou Kumiai, the Japan silk manufacturers'
co-operative, decided at a directors' meeting to cut more than five working
days a month for at least three months. This will cut silk output by a total
of 4,000 bales (60kg each).
It also decided to build up 1,000 bales of stocks by the end of September
and to set up a committee to consider scrapping some production facilities.
The silk manufacturers will ask the agriculture ministry to continue selling
imported silk from its stocks while buying the same amount of domestic raw
silk in return. The operation supports raw silk futures prices as imported
silk is not deliverable on futures exchanges here.
Spot silk prices have dropped below the government-set standard silk price
of Y10,712 (Pounds 68) a kilogram since last month. When prices fall below
the standard price, the semi-official Silk Agency may buy silk to stabilise
prices.
The spot silk price in Yokohama stood at Y8,310 a kilogram on Wednesday,
against Y8,500 on Tuesday.
