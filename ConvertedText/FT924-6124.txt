FT  23 NOV 92 / Economics: All eyes on German inflation


   By EMMA TUCKER


IMPORTANT indicators on German inflation this week could have significant
ramifications for European countries locked into the exchange rate
mechanism.
Another big jump in the November consumer prices index will delay further
easing of German interest rates by the Bundesbank, which will force other
ERM members to keep their lending rates high.
Last month, the annual rate of consumer price rises shot up to 3.7 per cent
from 3.5 per cent, reversing an almost continuous downwards direction which
began in the spring.
So this week's data will be watched carefully to see whether the October
figure was an aberration, or the beginning of an upwards turn.
'If November does not see a substantial declaration in the inflation rate,
the chances of the Bundesbank tolerating any further easing - in official or
unofficial interest rates - is approximately zero,' says Ms Alison Cottrell,
international economist at Midland Global Market research.
Figures for German M3 growth in October are also out this week.
The data will inevitably be distorted by the extensive foreign exchange
intervention that took place in September as the ERM came under severe
strain.
In the UK, the most important figures are the trade statistics, released
today. These are expected to show a rise in the visible trade deficit to
around Pounds 1.2bn, from Pounds 1.1bn in September.
