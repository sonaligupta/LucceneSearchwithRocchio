FT  23 APR 93 / Arts: Today's Television


   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY


The best thing on Fridays is the news quiz Have I Got News For You. Today
the regulars - chairman Angus Deayton and team captains Ian Hislop and Paul
Merton - are joined by Fiona Armstrong whose F-factor was found by breakfast
television to be wanting, and Chris Evans, who has proved to be such a hit
with the kiddiwinks at breakfast time on Channel 4 (10.00 BBC2). That aside,
it seems to be mostly a question of Marks and Spencer drama and old movies.
Among the M & S drama (dependable, inoffensive, middle of the road) is the
hospital series Casualty which is being repeated on BBC1 (8.00); The Chief,
a police series which has proved it can achieve a higher plane from time to
time (9.00 ITV); and The Riff Raff Element which, in some quarters, is
credited with being a rather subtle and successful satire about the English
class system. Long winded and short on jokes would seem nearer the mark
(9.30 BBC1). The movies include a 'colour tinted' version of Fritz Lang's
1926 futurist work Metropolis with large chunks cut out and modern music
(11.35 C4).
