FT  14 APR 94 / Seoul acts on asylum seekers


   By JOHN BURTON


   SEOUL


South Korea yesterday indicated that it might accept loggers escaping from
North Korean-managed lumber camps in Russia.
Seoul has so far refused to grant asylum to at least 120 workers who have
fled the logging camps because of fears that it could antagonise Pyongyang
and disrupt inter-Korean negotiations on North Korean nuclear inspections.
But the recent collapse of the nuclear talks has persuaded the government
'to review the issue based on the principle of humanitarianism,' said Mr
Choo Don-shik, the presidential spokesman.
The government is also responding to growing public pressure to accept the
loggers, who are considered South Korean citizens under its constitution.
The lumber camps, which employ 15,000 North Koreans, were established in
Siberia in the late 1960s, with North Korea providing labour in return for
receiving wood supplies.
North Koreans who have fled the lumber camps speak of food shortages,
beatings, and death sentences for those trying to escape.
