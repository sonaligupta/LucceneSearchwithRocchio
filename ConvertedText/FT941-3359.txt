deals

Minebea of Japan and FAG Kugelfischer of Germany, the two ball bearing
manufacturers recently hit by heavy losses, are to supply each other with
bearings in order to reduce their investment and production costs.
Under the agreements - signed in Thailand, where Minebea has its largest
factory - Minebea will supply FAG with miniature and small ball bearings,
while FAG will supply Minebea with small and medium-sized bearings.
The two companies will also swap technical knowhow.
They said they would notify the European Commission of the deal to obtain
clearance under the European Union's competition rules.
Executives from Minebea, which is particularly strong in Asia, and FAG, with
its European base, said each company would continue to market products
separately using its own brands.
'Each company will benefit from the manufacturing strengths of the other,'
said Mr Goro Ogino, Minebea president, in a statement, 'and both companies
will be able to realise important cost savings at the capital investment and
manufacturing level'.
Mr Peter-Juergen Kreher, chairman of FAG's management board, said: 'Today's
agreements represent a vital opportunity for us both to ensure our ability
to deliver a wider range of ball bearing products at the lowest possible
cost.'
According to the deal, Minebea will supply bearings with an outer diameter
of up to 24mm, while FAG will supply those with diameters between 24 and
35mm.
Both companies have undergone extensive restructuring. Minebea's net loss
was Y61.21bn (Dollars 578m)in the year to September 30, 1993, while FAG
reported a net loss of DM439m (Dollars 260m) in 1992.
