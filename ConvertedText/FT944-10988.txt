Highlands Gold, the Papua New Guinea-based mining company which is
controlled by MIM Group of the UK, is buying out the 5.81 per cent interest
in the Frieda River copper-gold joint venture held by Norddeutsche Affinerie
for 400,000 kina (Dollars 351,648), writes Nikki Tait in Sydney.
The sale, which takes effect in April and is subject to government approval,
will take Highlands' stake in the project to almost 72 per cent. The
Japanese OMRD consortium owns the remainder.
News of the deal comes just days after Mr Norm Fussell, Highlands chairman,
said that the group was increasingly confident that a mine could be
devel-oped at Nena within four years, and announced that exploration
expenditure was being stepped up.
