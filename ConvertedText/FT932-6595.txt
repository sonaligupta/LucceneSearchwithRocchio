FT  27 MAY 93 / International Company News: Police to investigate YSL share
dealings

THE Paris stock market authorities have called in police to investigate
share dealings in Yves Saint-Laurent, the French fashion house, prior to the
announcement of a sharp fall in six-month profits last autumn. Dealings in
YSL, which has been rocked by controversy since its FFr3.6bn (Dollars 650m)
takeover earlier this year by the Elf-Sanofi pharmaceuticals group, have for
some months been under investigation by the Commission des Operations de
Bourse (COB), the stock market watchdog.
The COB yesterday said 'a significant number of YSL shares' were bought in
off-market dealings by foreign investors in the weeks before the publication
of the company's interim results on September 21.
These revealed an unexpectedly steep fall in net profits from FFr2.6bn in
the first half of 1991 to FFr41m in the same period last year.
French market sources suggest that 2 per cent of YSL's shares changed hands
on September 17 and September 18.
