FT  23 NOV 92 / Survey of World Commercial Vehicles (14): Quieter and
cleaner roads ahead - A look at tougher regulations on emissions and noise


   By JOHN GRIFFITHS


BELATEDLY, Europe has begun to follow North America along the road to a
quieter and less polluting truck and bus population for the 1990s.
It is doing so because of an EC directive issued last year reducing the
amounts of gaseous and particulate pollutants commercial vehicles over 3.5
tonnes may emit.
Because noise is also regarded as an environmental pollutant, further
legislation means that heavy commercial vehicles are destined to become
quieter as well.
New models of trucks produced since July 1 this year have had to emit fewer
exhaust pollutants than their predecessors.
From October 1 next year all new trucks produced, even those designed and
developed before the legislation was drawn up, will have to comply with the
tighter rules.
These changes, however, represent only stage one of a two-stage process and
can be complied with relatively easily by truck makers because they are
based on Brussels's assessments of short-term environmental gains achievable
from readily available technology.
A much bigger problem is stage two, which will apply to all new models of
diesel trucks from October 1, 1995, and to all production one year later.
The emissions limits, in terms of grammes of pollutants per test, to be
introduced in the second stage, will see Europe's standards for truck
exhaust emissions brought into line with those due to become applicable to
trucks in North America for the 1994 model year. These will be the strictest
rules in the world. The standards will also bring the EC into line with
Switzerland and Austria.
They are unlikely to be quite so effective in EC countries, however, because
EC ministers have not yet agreed to revise the driving test cycle on which
exhaust emissions limits are based.
The US 'transient' test cycle is more stringent than the low-speed test
cycle used to set EC standards and more accurately reflects modern day
driving conditions.
The UK, often in the past seen as a laggard on vehicle exhaust emissions,
pressed unsuccessfully for a revised cycle to be incorporated in the
upcoming EC standards. But at least a proposal to introduce the transient
test is now on the agenda for discussion of yet tighter EC emissions
standards intended to be introduced for trucks in 1999.
The 1995/96 standards aim roughly to halve pollution caused by large diesel
trucks and buses by reducing emissions of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides,
gaseous or 'unburnt' hydrocarbons and solid particles of burned fuel.
The main targets of the legislation are acid rain-causing oxides of nitrogen
and the particulates, which some research indicates are carcinogenic.
As part of the 1991 EC directive, there are also new lower limits on
particulate emissions specifically due to be applied to new trucks from
January 1 next year; however, the limits are not regarded as sufficiently
tough to require particulate traps.
The 1995/6 standards are likely to require substantial changes to truck
diesel engine technology if they are to be met.
According to Ricardo Group, the UK-based engineering consultancy which works
on engine projects for most vehicle makers world-wide, the US 1994 standards
continue to represent 'one of the greatest challenges facing the truck
industry'.
To meet them, truck manufacturers and the leading independent engine
producers such as Cummins Engine are having to resort to advanced technology
such as multi-valve cylinder heads, a variety of electronic control systems,
exhaust catalysts and 'traps' to capture and subsequently burn off
particulates. Of necessity, the 1996 legislation will also lead directly to
the introduction of improved quality diesel fuels, which under another draft
EC directive must have its sulphur content reduced to meet the lower limits
on particulate emissions. Sulphur is the main culprit in the generation of
particulates.
But the US itself is not standing still.
The US industry has already achieved a strong research and development
momentum from a tightening of US standards which took effect in 1991 and
which cut the permissible NOx level to the present 5 grammes from 6. They
were able to meet the tighter standard by redesigning engine combustion
chambers and pistons.
Federal legislators now envisage reducing permitted pollutant levels further
from May 1998.
California, always the first to tighten the environmental screw, plans to
demand such a cut four years earlier.
Trucks with a gross weight of up to 26,000lb are targeted to reduce
emissions by 50 per cent from a 1994 baseline, and by 30 to 50 per cent if
it can be shown that a higher reduction is not technically achievable,
according to the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers' Association. Part of the
solution may lie in the use of alternative fuels such as methanol, which are
already undergoing fleet test programmes.
The US industry, in conjunction with the Southwest Research Institute, has
now launched an international co-operative industry research programme aimed
at meeting likely end-of-century standards.
The Clean Heavy-Duty Diesel Engine programme aims for a 2-gramme NOx limit,
0.1 grammes of particulates and 0.5 grammes of hydrocarbons per brake
horsepower hour.
Leading engine manufacturers taking part include Caterpillar and Navistar of
the US, Hino, Isuzu, Mitsubishi and Nissan Diesel of Japan, and Volvo of
Sweden, and the programme will run until 1995.
