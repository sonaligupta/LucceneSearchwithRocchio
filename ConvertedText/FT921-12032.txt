FT  29 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: BET


Yesterday's 10 per cent fall in BET shares, though less alarming than the
collapse a year ago, must have given the group's managers an uncomfortable
sense of deja vu. Then it was worries that BET was about to join the ranks
of failed 1980s conglomerates. Now the concern is about profit downgrades
and the outlook for the final dividend. The heavy trading volume suggested
large investors had decided not to take the risk.
Given that BET was already yielding more than 10 per cent, the reduced
profit figures were indeed less relevant than the safety of the dividend. It
seems curious that the market should be discounting a decision which will
not be taken until June. By then, management will be in a position to survey
a post-election economy. If recovery is anywhere in sight, a maintained
pay-out, though uncovered, might perhaps be justified by the group's cash
flow and financial position. But after yesterday's fall BET will have little
to lose from a cut, so the market's expectation could prove self-fulfilling.
