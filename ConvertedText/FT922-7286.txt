FT  19 MAY 92 / Observer: Genscher's giggle


The irrepressible Hans-Dietrich Genscher, who handed in his cards yesterday
after 18 years as Germany's foreign minister, couldn't resist a departing
crack during a morning radio interview.
It was at the expense of his British colleague, Douglas Hurd, and his visit
to Genscher's home town of Halle - a grimy industrial city in east Germany
through which all diplomatic visitors have dutifully traipsed for the
greater glorification of one Hans-Dietrich.
On this occasion, Genscher reminded Hurd that it was also the home town of
that great composer, so beloved of the British, Georg Friedrich Handel.
Indeed, Handel had actually composed a hymn of honour to his home town,
Genscher told Hurd.
It was only later as the two listened to a local church performance of
Handel's Messiah that the pfennig finally dropped, Genscher giggled.
Understanding finally came to Hurd during the Halle-lujah chorus . . .
