FT  14 APR 94 / RMC rises to Pounds 178m with German help


   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent


A strong performance in Germany, Europe's busiest construction market,
helped lift pre-tax profits at RMC Group, the world's largest concrete
producer, by nearly 7 per cent from Pounds 166.4m to Pounds 177.8m.
Mergers and joint ventures involving RMC's growing German operations have
brought substantial tax advantages, reducing the tax charge from almost 36
per cent in 1992 to just under 26 per cent last year.
As a result, earnings per share rose more than a quarter from 31.2p to
39.4p. The final dividend is going up from 13.4p to 14.4p, raising the total
payment by 5 per cent to 21p.
The better than expected figures sent the shares up from 950p to 966p.
The German construction market continues to steam ahead, with housebuilding
and renovation in the former east Germany more than offsetting reductions in
infrastructure investment and commercial building in the west.
RMC's experience echoed that of other UK building companies, including
Redland, the materials group, which last year increased pre-tax profits by
40 per cent to Pounds 279m. Redland earned more from its eastern German roof
tile operations than it did in the whole of the UK.
RMC's German profits last year rose almost 17 per cent to Pounds 140.6m on a
10 per cent increase in turnover to Pounds 1.49bn.
German profits were more than four times UK profits, which last year more
than trebled from Pounds 10.5m to Pounds 34m helped by a recovery in
housebuilding, cost cuts and slightly firmer prices for sand and gravel,
ready-mixed concrete and coated stone. The group's DIY and builders'
merchants businesses also performed well.
The group said further progress was expected in the UK this year as the
construction market continued to pick up. The main engine for profits,
however, was likely to remain Germany which last year accounted for 44 per
cent of group turnover and 67 per cent of pre-interest profits.
Mr Derek Jenkins, finance director, said total housing starts in western
Germany were forecast to rise to 550,000 this year, compared with 198,000 in
the UK. Cement sales from RMC's Berlin works were forecast to rise to 1.8m
tonnes from 1.5m tonnes.
By the end of this year, RMC would have invested Pounds 500m in eastern
Germany since the Berlin Wall was dismantled, said Mr Jenkins. The group had
also seen a strong performance in Israel and improvement in the US.
