FT  16 NOV 93 / Observer: What a Payne


Isn't Sedgwick sounding a mite defensive about the composition of the board
of its CLM Insurance Fund? 'This is without any reservation the best board
of any of the (19)' corporate capital vehicles investing in Lloyd's, the
insurance broking group boasted when Observer rang up.
To be sure, Joe Palmer, the new PIA chairman, Cadbury committee member
Jonathan Charkham, Lord Rees, chairman of Lasmo et al are all fine fellows.
The only trouble with also adding Sedgwick vice chairman Jim Payne to the
list is that these days his presence necessitates a 200-word footnote to the
CLM prospectus explaining that Payne, who had been deputy chairman of
reinsurance brokers Bland Payne, was criticised in the DTI report into the
affairs of the collapsed London United Investments.
