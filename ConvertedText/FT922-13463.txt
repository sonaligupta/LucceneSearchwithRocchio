FT  11 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): UK election result fuels
continental rally


   By Our Markets Staff


THE CONSERVATIVE victory in the UK general election added fuel to the
continental rise yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT was boosted by a stronger Japanese market, the easing of monetary
policy by the US Federal Reserve and the return of a Conservative government
in the UK. Analysts said the end to the political uncertainty in Britain
raised hopes for a cut in UK interest rates in the second half of the year.
There were also expectations that a UK economic recovery would boost German
exports.
The DAX index closed ahead 15.82 to 1,736.07, a gain of 0.95 per cent on the
week, while the FAZ index, calculated at midsession was up 8.02 at 706.67,
for a rise on the week of 0.63 per cent. Turnover rose to DM6.2bn from
DM5.1bn.
The construction group Hochtief advanced DM13 or 1 per cent after saying
that it would increase its dividend to DM12 from DM10. Degussa closed
unchanged at DM336 after saying that it was not anticipating another cut in
its dividend and reported a slight increase in six-month group profit.
Banks were stronger following comments late on Thursday by a central banker
that there was room for a cut in interest rates during the second half of
the year. Deutsche Bank was ahead DM4.3 at DM715.5 and Commerzbank gained
DM4.2 to DM268.0
Preussag gained DM4.10 to DM401 on news that group net profit for the first
four months was unchanged.
Daimler-Benz was DM10 up at DM778. After the bourse closed it said that it
was investing DM36bn in research and development over the next five years.
PARIS built on Thursday's gains as the CAC-40 index ended up 30.42 or 1.6
per cent to 1,974.06, also up 1.6 per cent on the week. Turnover was
estimated at FFr3bn.
Oils remained firm. Total rose FFr4.60 to FFr249.60 after announcing
pleasing 1991 results after the close on Thursday. The oil refiner's
analysts meeting was heavily attended yesterday. Elf rose FFr7 to FFr375.40.
Euro Disney, which opens this weekend, recovered FFr3.20 to FFr140.90 after
its recent weakness.
Among smaller stocks, L'Oreal jumped FFr30 or 3.7 per cent to FFr849 ahead
of its results on Monday.
MILAN failed to match the rises on other European bourses as interest
remained thin. The Comit index rose 4.93 to 501.16, but was 1.5 per cent
lower on the week, as turnover rose slightly to around L90bn from L77bn.
Dealers reported an unusual amount of block trades, some linked to the
liquidation of a local broker. A block of 1.1m shares or 2 per cent in the
state aerospace and engineering group, Alenia SpA, went through the market
at L3,169.40 per share, well above the share's closing price of L1,938, down
L15.
Fiat rose L25 to L4,745 and the tyre and cable maker Pirelli rose L28 to
L1,229. The food sector rose 3.6 per cent, with Eridania up L299 to L6,800
and Sme rising L100 to L3,400.
ZURICH consolidated Thursday's gains, assisted by a fall in domestic
interest rates. The SMI index closed up 18.9 at 1,848.0 for a 1 per cent
advance on the week.
Banks led the gains: Union Bank bearers were SFr50 stronger at SFr3,790 and
Swiss Bank bearers added SFr5 to SFr283.
AMSTERDAM followed other European bourses higher. The CBS Tendency Index
closed up 1.3 at 124.7, unchanged on the week. Turnover was Fl 757.9m after
Fl 578.9m.
A lack of corporate news kept individual stocks relatively quiet during the
session, although Elsevier continued to be actively traded, closing Fl 2.7
higher at Fl 113.5, while Unilever gained Fl 1.6 to Fl 182.2.
Pakhoed was stronger following analysts' presentations in London and
Amsterdam in which the transport group said that the outlook for 1992 was
not as bad as forecasts earlier in the week had predicted. It gained 60
cents to Fl 41.10.
MADRID took its cue from the UK. The general index gained 3.53 to 249.84, a
rise of 0.3 per cent on the week. However, analysts said that there was
caution ahead of Monday's inflation figures. Volume in Union Fenosa was
exceptionally high at 3.5m shares and it closed down Pta5 at Pta468.
STOCKHOLM rebounded from a three-day slump in heavy trading. Easing money
market rates as well as news late on Thursday that the drawn out battle for
control of the insurer Skandia had come to an end lifted sentiment. The
Affarsvarlden general index rose 14.6 to 975.6, down 0.5 per cent on the
week, in turnover of SKr568m after SKr431m.
BRUSSELS rebounded in line with other markets. The Bel-20 index rose 13.16
or 1.1 per cent to 1,178.77. Solvay, which announced on Thursday it would
hold its dividend steady at BFr500 a share despite a 22 per cent decline in
1991 profit, rose BFr175 to BFr12,200.
