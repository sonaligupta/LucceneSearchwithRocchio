KUWAIT plans to privatise its telecommunications services, a communications
ministry source said yesterday, Reuter reports from Kuwait.
He said a company would be established, possibly within six months, which
could offer shares and begin functioning in 1994.
The company, to be called the Kuwait Telecommunications Company, would take
control of local and international phone calls, fax and telex services from
the communications ministry. Mobile phones will remain in private hands, he
said.
Initially the company would be 51 per cent owned by the public and 49 per
cent by the government, the source said.
The government could then sell up to a 25 per cent stake to foreign
investors, retaining a 24 per cent stake, he said.
The equipment of the telecommunications ministry would be transferred to the
new company, the source said.
'We are in the process of evaluating our assets,' he said.
The launching of the company would be a major step in the government's
programme to privatise public services.
The investment branch of the Kuwaiti government has reported 'improprieties'
in its troubled investments in Spain and the government has referred the
case to the prosecutor-general, Reuter reports from Kuwait.
Finance minister Nasser Abdulla al-Rodhan told the official news agency KUNA
yesterday that the executive committee of the London-based Kuwait Investment
Office (KIO) disclosed the improprieties in a preliminary report.
'The finance minister has referred the subject to the prosecutor-general to
take the necessary legal measures,' KUNA added.
