FT  16 DEC 94 / Bank of Japan publishes preliminary figures


   By GERARD BAKER


   TOKYO


Preliminary money supply figures published by the Bank of Japan yesterday
gave mixed signals about the state of liquidity in the Japanese economy,
writes Gerard Baker in Tokyo. The basic measure of the broad money stock
accelerated in November by 2.6 per cent on a year earlier, compared with an
annual growth rate of 2.4 per cent in October. On a monthly basis, the broad
money figure - M2 (cash in circulation plus sight and demand deposits) and
certificates of deposit - rose 0.2 per cent from October. But the rate of
growth of the broadest measure of liquidity slowed slightly. M2 plus CDs
plus postal savings deposits, government bonds and investment trusts grew by
3.5 per cent in November from a year earlier, compared with a preliminary
3.6 per cent rise a year ago.
