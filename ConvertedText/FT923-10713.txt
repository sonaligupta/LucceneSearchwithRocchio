FT  29 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Efim wins approval for L200bn
credit line

   ROME


THE Italian Treasury yesterday approved a credit line of L200bn (Dollars
178.1m) for Efim, the debt-ridden state holding company which was put into
voluntary liquidation on July 17.
The credit is intended to allow Mr Alberto Predieri, the administrator of
the liquidation, funds to cover operating needs of the holding with its
37,000 employees spread among over 80 subsidiaries. Efim's L8,500bn debt to
the banks has been frozen for up to two years. It is understood the credit
line will be used to pay wages and supplies.
This is the second measure introduced by the government to help Efim. Last
Friday, the Ministry of Industry agreed to halve the cost of energy charged
to Alumix, Efim's aluminium subsidiary.
Alumix has been the biggest single burden on Efim, largely due to high
energy costs. Augusta, Efim's aerospace unit, last week received a lift with
a L1,000bn helicopter sale to Canada.
