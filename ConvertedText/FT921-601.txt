FT  28 MAR 92 / Letter: Which class of reader?


   From Mr PETER WOOD


Sir, Roy Greenslade's argument ('Book Review: A better class of reader',
March 26) that British newspaper reading habits in 'a nation with two
distinct presses appealing to two different audiences' are class-based is, I
believe, mistaken. First, it assumes too easily that the upper and middle
class constitute 'an articulate, literate elite' without indicating what
literacy ought to mean in such a context. Second, it ignores the subtle but
significant differences between broadsheet newspapers and what might be
regarded as serious intellectual and emotional divides - as for example
between Guardian readers and Times readers.
The notion that the upper and middle classes in Britain nowadays constitute
any sort of literate elite in an age when genuine discussion is notable for
its absence, when Lord Young regards Radio 3 as an 'indulgence', and when
few people other than academics seem to read anything other than newspapers
is remarkable (and creditable) for its optimism.
