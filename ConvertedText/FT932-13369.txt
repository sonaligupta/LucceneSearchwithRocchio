FT  23 APR 93 / UK Company News: Clark's shareholders urged to reject Shoes


   By MAGGIE URRY


SHAREHOLDERS in C&J Clark, the private shoe company which has received a
takeover proposal from Berisford International, the property and food group,
were yesterday sent a letter from a group of shareholders urging serious
consideration of the bid.
The letter is from Mr Hugh Clark, Mr Michael Clark and Mr David Edwards, and
is in part a response to a letter from Shoes, a group of 'shareholders
opposed to enforced sale'. The three say that the acronym is misleading as
the sale depends on a vote of shareholders and is not 'enforced'.
It also condemns Shoes for recommending rejection of the bid without putting
forward 'a deliverable alternative'.
Shoes also published a letter yesterday strongly recommending shareholders
not to vote for the bid and promising a fuller letter next week containing
details of what it considers to be a viable alternative.
Shareholders will vote on the future ownership of Clark at an extraordinary
meeting on May 7. Before them will be a resolution to sell the company's
business and assets to Berisford.
If that is passed Berisford will make an offer worth 213p in cash, shares or
loan notes, and a further 26p of cash to be raised from the sale of surplus
properties. If the offer fails to win 90 per cent acceptances, Clark can
revert to the plan of selling the business to Berisford.
