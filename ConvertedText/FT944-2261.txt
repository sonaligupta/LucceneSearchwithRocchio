FT  16 DEC 94 / Survey of Slovakia (5): The drive for funds


   By VINCENT BOLAND


Nomura Securities, the Japanese investment house, has given a big boost to
foreign investor sentiment towards Slovakia with the purchase of a 29 per
cent stake in VUB Kupon, the country's biggest investment fund. Nomura payed
SKK2.18bn (Dollars 68m) for the stake in September, in one of the biggest
foreign investments in the country so far. The transaction was also the
largest ever recorded on the Bratislava stock exchange.
VUB Kupon is managed by VUB Invest, the fund management subsidiary of
Vseobecna Uverova Banka, Slovakia's largest commercial bank. It owns large
blocks of shares in many of the big companies in Slovakia and the Czech
Republic, and is currently heavily weighted towards the latter, with roughly
75 per cent of its portfolio currently represented by Czech assets, says Mr
Ladislav Vaskovic, managing director of VUB Invest.
Slovak fund managers are currently establishing new investment funds to
attract some of the 3.2m investors who have bought vouchers to participate
in the privatisation programme drafted by the outgoing government of prime
minister Mr Jozef Moravcik. Barring undue political delays, the final size
of the voucher programme is likely to be SKK60bn, and competition for the
investment points attached to vouchers is fierce.
Each voucher booklet, which can be bought for SKK1,000, is worth 1,000
investment points. Shares are allocated on the basis of demand.
Shares in companies considered attractive by investors will cost more points
than those of unattractive companies.
