FT  02 JUL 92 / Britain sends aircraft to join Sarajevo aid effort


   By JUDY DEMPSEY


BRITAIN is sending a Hercules transport aircraft today to help bring
humanitarian aid to the 300,000 starving people of Sarajevo, the besieged
capital of the breakaway Yugoslav republic of Bosnia.
The British flight is part of a big international effort to get food and
medicines to the city, under siege from Serb irregular forces for nearly
three months. Canadian troops are nearing Sarajevo by road to secure the
airport, at present under tenuous United Nations control.
The Hercules aircraft was due to leave at 9am for the Croatian capital of
Zagreb with supplies of food. The aircraft will be placed under UN control.
In the Lords last night, Baroness Chalker, the foreign office minister,
announced that Britain would also airlift vehicles to ensure that supplies
did not lie undelivered at Sarajevo airport.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general, arrived in London last night
for talks today with Mr John Major and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign
secretary, on the Yugoslav conflict.
Meanwhile, in Washington, President George Bush ruled out unilateral US
intervention in Bosnia.
But Mr James Baker, secretary of state, said the US was ready to move
swiftly to get a UN Security Council resolution authorising use of force if
necessary to end fighting in the republic.
