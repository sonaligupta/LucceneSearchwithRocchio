FT  06 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Hillsdown sells its remaining abattoir


   By MAGGIE URRY


Hillsdown Holdings has completed its exit from the red meat slaughtering
industry with the sale of its last abattoir, in Ipswich.
Over the last two years it has sold 25 abattoirs - 11 in 1992 and 14 in 1993
 -which had become lossmaking due to severe over-capacity in the industry.
Hillsdown made a provision against losses on the disposal programme which
appeared as part of a Pounds 92.3m extraordinary charge in the 1992
accounts.
Analysts believe the provision relating to abattoirs totalled about Pounds
30m and Hillsdown is expected to have utilised the whole of this covering
losses on trading and on the sales of the abattoirs.
However, the abattoir sales should have released significant working
capital. The sale was completed on December 31, also the last day of
Hillsdown's financial year.
Hillsdown's abattoirs were largely acquired when it bought FMC in 1983. It
had invested to bring the abattoirs up to new EU standards, originally due
to be introduced on January 1 1993, but later deferred until 1996.
This delay exacerbated the over-capacity in the industry partly caused by
changes in EU export subsidies which reduced the throughput of abattoirs.
Hillsdown has also announced the sale of its 67 per cent stake in Schils, a
Dutch group of companies which make milk substitutes fed to veal calves. The
buyer is the Schils management which is also the minority partner.
