FT  22 JUL 94 / Bosnia map approval retracted


   By EDWARD MORTIMER


   LONDON


The international peace plan for Bosnia disintegrated further yesterday when
Bosnian Serb leaders failed to give their unconditional acceptance and the
Bosnian president retracted his previous approval. Mr Radovan Karadzic,
Bosnian Serb leader, left Geneva after the sponsors of the plan - the
international 'contact group' made up of the US, Russia, UK, France and
Germany - refused further meetings with him, snubbing his attempt to
renegotiate the plan before giving an answer to it. Meanwhile, in Sarajevo
Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnian president, withdrew his previous unconditional
approval of the plan, saying that in view of the Serb rejection his
government now wanted to add conditions of its own.
Before leaving Geneva the Bosnian Serb delegation released the text of the
declaration on the plan adopted by their 'parliament' on Tuesday. This
requested more details on a range of issues, from constitutional
arrangements to the lifting of sanctions, and added ominously that 'further
work is required on the proposed map'.
