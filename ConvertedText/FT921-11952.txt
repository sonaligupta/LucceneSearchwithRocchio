FT  29 JAN 92 / Serbs and Croats exchange their dead


Croatian soldiers, on the left, and Serbian soldiers, on the right, exchange
the bodies of their dead, at Stari Grabovac, near Novska in Croatia. Plans
by the United Nations to send 10,000 peacekeepers to Yugoslavia were
undermined yesterday when Mr Marrack Goulding, the UN special envoy, failed
to persuade one of the main Serb leaders in Croatia to accept their
deployment. Mr Goulding said Mr Milan Babic, leader of the self-proclaimed
Serb Republic of Krajina, in Knin, southern Croatia, had 'maintained his
objections'.
