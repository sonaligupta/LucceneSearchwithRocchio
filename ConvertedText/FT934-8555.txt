FT  15 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: UK lead on air transport essential


   From Mr NORMAN NICHOLSON


Sir, If vested interests in the European air transport industry are to be
challenged you say that passengers must make their voices heard ('Closed
skies' November 4). Unfortunately, with little opportunity to shop around,
this is too often impossible. Most European governments are reluctant to
allow the concept of the national 'flag carrier' to die. This was clear in
the evidence presented to the 'committee of wise men' set up to look at the
industry's problems - a committee that did not include a single
representative for passengers.
UK passengers have enjoyed the benefits of liberalisation. Not only do we
have a choice of airline on the most popular routes from Heathrow but
increasingly also a choice of airport. It is surprising that the travelling
public elsewhere in the European Union is not more vociferous in demanding
similar deals. The UK must continue to lead by example.
This means taking all possible steps to ensure competition can flourish,
including a much freer arrangement with the US. The capability to drive
change has yet to shift from the regulator to the passenger.
