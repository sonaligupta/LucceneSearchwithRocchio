FT  01 JUL 92 / People: Line-up to review pensions law


The presence of Professor Tony Atkinson, architect of the Labour party's
controversial tax plans, and Alastair Ross-Goobey, a former adviser to
Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer, on the government's
newly-established Pensions Law Review Committee should ensure that it is not
unduly influenced by the powerful pension industry lobby.
Atkinson, of the London School of Economics, an acknowledged expert on
income and wealth distribution, and Ross-Goobey, chief investment strategist
at stockbrokers James Capel, are among the nine new members of the committee
which has been set up to examine the administration and regulation of
pension schemes in the wake of the abuses thrown up by the Maxwell affair.
The appointment of Sue Ward, a freelance journalist and former TUC expert on
pensions policy, to the committee is a further sign that the government
wants to get as wide a range of opinions as possible before it drafts any
new pensions legislation.
The other members of the committee, chaired by Roy Goode, professor of
English Law at Oxford, are: David Berridge, Scottish Equitable Life's chief
executive; Harvie Brown of William Mercer Fraser; Bryan Hines, a former
general manager, insurance and investments at ICI; Stuart James, a partner
of Rowe and Maw; Terence Libby, chairman of Morrisflex; and Patricia Triggs,
a partner in KPMG Peat Marwick McLintock.
The committee, set up on June 8, will report within 12 months.
Its terms of reference are: 'To review the framework of law and regulation
within which occupational pension schemes operate, taking into account the
rights and interests of scheme members, pensioners and employers; to
consider in particular the status and ownership of occupational pension
funds and the accountability and roles of trustees, fund managers, auditors,
and pension scheme advisers; and to make recommendations.'
