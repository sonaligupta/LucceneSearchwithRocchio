FT  08 JUN 92 / Observer: Closed tender


Wouldn't it be nice if Premier John Major's commitment to open government
shed some light on Whitehall's secretive system for deciding public
spending?
Opening up the process to public scrutiny might arguably help the government
to reach better decisions. But officials have rejected requests for
publication of details of the spending bids different departments are now
submitting as part of the build-up to the Treasury's Autumn Statement.
By custom, the papers are never published, though no one can rule out
'leaks' of selected contents by individual departments anxious to press
their case for more money.
While the public would clearly be better informed about the issues if
different departments' bids were open to examination, the official view
remains that government efficiency is best served if the arguments go on
behind closed doors. Another piece of civil service stone-walling that needs
knocking down.
