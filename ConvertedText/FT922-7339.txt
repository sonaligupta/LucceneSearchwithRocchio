FT  19 MAY 92 / Upheaval fails to halt building of warships


   By ANDREW SLADE


RUSSIA is continuing to build big warships despite funding problems, and its
submarine operations have hardly been affected by the dissolution of the
Soviet Union, a western naval authority said yesterday.
Capt Richard Sharpe, editor of Jane's Fighting Ships, the 1992-93 edition of
which was published yesterday, said production of nuclear missile-carrying
submarines had come to a temporary halt last year, but three nuclear-powered
hunter-killer submarines and three diesel-powered craft had been launched.
He warned that proliferation of submarine expertise was one of the main
problems posed by the break-up of the Soviet Union. Iran is said to be
interested in buying one or two diesel-powered submarines.
Of the former Soviet Union's 24 naval yards, 14 were now under civilian
control.
Captain Sharpe predicted that if this trend continued, Russia would probably
have only two major submarine yards, with perhaps another two yards
producing large surface vessels and three building minor warships.
However, at least three of these yards were each equivalent to any other
naval yard in the world.
