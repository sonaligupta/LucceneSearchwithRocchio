FT  13 MAR 93 / Argentina leads Gatt appeal


   By FRANCES WILLIAMS


   GENEVA


Nearly 40 rich and poor countries led by Argentina have appealed to the US,
the EC and Japan to 'display leadership' in returning swiftly to the
negotiating table in Geneva to complete the long-stalled global trade talks,
Frances Williams reports from Geneva.
The letter, sent by President Carlos Menem of Argentina to the leaders of
the three big traders on Thursday, urges the US administration to request
only a short renewal of its negotiating mandate from Congress.
