FT  28 APR 94 / Government Bonds: Bundesbank repo rate cut prompts European
rally

   LONDON, NEW YORK


European government bond markets rallied yesterday, helped by the
Bundesbank's decision to lower its repo rate by a further 11 basis points to
5.47 per cent.
But market participants said they did not expect to see the German central
bank follow up its repo move with further cuts in the key discount and
Lombard interest rates.
The Bundesbank accepted bids amounting to DM55.1bn in its latest round of
13-day securities repurchase agreements at rates of 5.47 per cent and above,
down from last week's rate of 5.58 per cent.
The bund market remained firm on the news, and the Liffe bund futures
contract, which opened at 94.66, traded from a low of 94.52 to a late
afternoon high of 95.12.
'The bond markets see that (11 basis point repo cut) as reasonably
generous,' said Mr Adrian James, bond analyst at NatWest Capital Markets.
Mr Reimat Jochimsen, Bundesbank council member, was quoted as saying that
the German central bank did not have to worry about any special inflationary
factors at present. However, he added that the trend in M3 money supply
growth made it difficult to make decisions on interest rates.
German M3 grew at an annualised rate of 15.2 per cent in March from 17.5 per
cent in February, way above the Bundesbank's target growth range of 4 to 6
per cent.
French government bond prices followed the German bund market, as the rate
cut raised hopes that the Bank of France may lower its intervention rate
today.
UK gilts slipped back in the wake of the Bank of England's auction
yesterday, reflecting disappointment at the cover ratio, but the market
later recovered to close little changed on the day.
The Bank of England sold Pounds 2bn of the 6 per cent stock due 1999 at an
average price of 93.23, corresponding to a yield of 7.46 per cent.
The lowest accepted bid was 93.21 (yielding 7.47 per cent) and the highest
bid was 93.26 (yielding 7.44 per cent). The cover ratio, which is the ratio
of total bids to the amount of stock actually sold, was 1.7 times, which
dealers said was below expectations.
The gilt market fell back immediately after the auction results were
announced, and the auction stock traded down to about 93.12 in the afternoon
before recovering.
The Liffe gilt futures contract opened at 107.07 and fell to a low of
106.13, but then climbed back to settle at 106.27, almost unchanged on the
previous day's close.
In the US, trading in Treasury bonds was suspended as the country observed a
day of mourning in honour of former president Richard Nixon, who died at the
weekend.
The more positive tone established over the past week is likely to be tested
this morning when the commerce department is scheduled to release its
preliminary estimate of first-quarter GDP.
Forecasts centred on a growth rate of 3.4 per cent in real terms, although
several economists were expecting the figure of less than 3 per cent. Many
of them had shaved a half percentage point from their earlier forecasts a
fortnight ago, when the government revealed a big decline in exports.
Mr Jack McIntyre, an analyst at Technical Data in Boston, said that if GDP
comes in below 3 per cent, bond prices are likely to jump and the yield on
the benchmark 30-year Treasury could test the 7.00 per cent mark. At
Tuesday's close, the long bond was yielding 7.10 per cent.
Japanese government bonds ended close to the highs of the day, buoyed by the
strength of the currency and the release of weaker-than-expected economic
data.
Dealers said the market tone remained firm, with the Japanese currency
trading at around Y103 to the dollar, and the release of retail sales
figures - which were down 3 per cent year-on-year - showed that consumer
demand remained poor. The June futures contract opened at 111.94 and reached
a high of 112.48, ending Tokyo trading at 112.44.
