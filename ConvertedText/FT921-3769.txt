FT  12 MAR 92 / Election '92: TUC criticises move on taxes


BUDGET tax changes will have a significantly smaller impact on employment
than if the same amount had been used to increase public spending, according
to an analysis by the Trades Union Congress.
The TUC said the tax measures could increase employment by between 30,000
and 40,000 jobs. A similar amount on public spending would have generated
more than 100,000 jobs.
Its analysis said the reduction in the uniform business rate was the only
significant across-the-board help for industry. But even here the scale of
relief was 'tiny' compared with the total business rate yield of Pounds
15bn. 'There is really very little for industry in the Budget,' the TUC
added.
