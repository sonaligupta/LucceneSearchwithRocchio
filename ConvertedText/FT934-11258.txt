FT  02 NOV 93 / Think-tank attacks utility regulators' power


   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor


THE regulators of privatised utilities are too powerful and should be made
more accountable, says a report from the Adam Smith Institute, the
free-market think-tank.
The institute says their style of regulation is confused, secretive and
ruled by personality cults. One of the worst features is that regulators
take advantage of the absence of a require-ment to justify their decisions,
in order to avoid court challenges of weak arguments.
This leaves utilities in the dark about the regulator's thinking and the
direction of policy. Serious mistakes are made, imposing heavy costs on the
utilities and their customers. The power of the regulators could also be
used by an incoming government in effect to renationalise the utilities.
The report calls for a radical rethink of the 10-year-old regulatory system
for gas, water, electricity, telephones and airports. These utilities should
be subjected to greater competition and the role of the regulators scaled
back accordingly, while being made more accountable to parliament.
But Who Will Regulate the Regulators? Adam Smith Institute, 23 Great Smith
