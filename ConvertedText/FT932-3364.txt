FT  15 JUN 93 / BIS Annual Report: UK job drain in financial services  - A
look at the annual report of the Bank for International Settlements


   By PETER MARSH


THE shake-out in employment in financial services in the UK has been much
greater than in any other comparable country, underlining how the recession
has hit what was once regarded as a high-growth industry.
The BIS report says employment in financial services in the UK dropped by
10.7 per cent between 1989 and last year. Employment in this field in the US
fell over the same period by 0.4 per cent, while in France it grew 0.6 per
cent.
The study says the falls in numbers working in this area of industry 'can be
attributed to automation and excess capacity' in the financial sector.
Another aspect was the high growth in employment in this field in many
countries, including Britain, during the economic upswing in the 1980s.
In 1990, the financial services industry in Britain employed 2.8m people, or
roughly one eighth of the total workforce and nearly double the comparable
number in 1979.
During the 1980s, employment in this field grew with particular rapidity in
insurance, property-related services and banking.
The reduction in numbers employed in this sector in Britain since 1989
compares with the 3.9 per cent gain in employment in the Japanese financial
services industry over the same period.
