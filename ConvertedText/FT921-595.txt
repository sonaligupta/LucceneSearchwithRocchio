FT  28 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Europa board faces new attack


   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent


THE BOARD of Europa Minerals, a UK mining finance house, is facing its
second assault by dissident shareholders in 12 months.
Austmin Gold, an Australian mining company which owns 14.4 per cent of the
UK group, has asked for representation on the board 'with a view to solving
Europa's problems and returning value to shareholders.'
Mr Arthur Smith, Europa's chairman, said yesterday the board would contest
Austmin's proposals. He said the directors were nearly ready to put forward
their own restructuring and refinancing proposals, worked out with adviser
Lazards.
Early indications suggested the board, which last April successfully fought
off a shareholder group led by Mr Alastair Holberton, another Australian,
had a battle on its hands.
Two institutional investors, Abbey Life, with just under 10 per cent of
Europa, and M&G, with just over 10 per cent, at present tend to favour
Austmin's proposals.
Waverley Asset Management, with about 6 per cent, is sitting on the fence
until it sees both proposals in detail. Nobody was available yesterday to
speak for Standard Life, a 9 per cent shareholder.
Austmin has nominated Mr Guido Staltari and Mr Bob Duffin as its proposed
representatives on the Europa board. It pointed out in a statement that
Europa shares were floated in February 1989 at 100p and now stood at 8p. It
said that in the 18 months to July 31 Europa had lost Pounds 13.7m or two
thirds of shareholders' funds.
Austmin said it recently made proposals to Europa and asked for board
representation. 'In the absence of any satisfaction on these issues, Austmin
has been left with no alternative but to requisition an extraordinary
meeting to obtain representation on the board.'
