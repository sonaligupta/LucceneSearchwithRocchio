FT  12 APR 94 / International Company News: Talks on NZ meat processing
plants fail


   By TERRY HALL

New Zealand's two most modern meat processing plants - which lie idle
following the collapse of the Fortex group - are to be offered for sale on
the international market. This follows the breakdown of negotiations with a
group of New Zealand businessmen who wanted to lease the plants.
Earlier, the Fortex receiver, Mr Alan Isaac, had unsuccessful talks with
other New Zealand meat processing companies over leasing the plants. These
failed when he refused to give these companies options to buy.
The failure to lease the plants is a further blow to New Zealand's most
important industry, which has an annual turnover of NZDollars 3.3bn (Dollars
1.89bn). Fortex had been considered a world leader in efficient meat
processing, and was the pioneer in 24-hour slaughtering.
Fortex, which was credited with leading reform of New Zealand's meat
processing industry, was well advanced with plans to open a plant in Wales
as a step to introduce its technology to UK slaughtering. It also had
extensive marketing operations in the UK, continental Europe, North America
and Asia.
Mr Isaac was appointed receiver last month after the surprise announcement
that the company expected to lose NZDollars 45m in the six months to
February 28 because of intense competition in the industry.
