FT  20 APR 91 / French gas tries to protect its monopoly


   By WILLIAM DAWKINS


   PARIS


GAZ de France, the French state gas distributor, is to appeal to the
government to scrap an amendment to a draft law that would greatly threaten
its monopoly.
The proposal appears to go in the direction of European Commmission efforts
to break up national energy monopolies. Yesterday, it led two Gaz de France
unions to call for a strike next Wednesday.
However, it is a legal accident, the result of poor drafting of a
parliamentary amendment tabled by two Socialist MPs in the first reading of
an obscure law on local administration. Even if the government corrects the
amendment, as seems likely, the mix-up gives a clear sign of the
difficulties likely to face any attempt to deregulate French energy
distribution.
The amendment allows communes, the basic unit of French local government, to
choose how to organise their own gas distribution, if not already being
supplied by Gaz de France. Only 6,000 of France's 36,000 communes are
connected to the utility - a measure of the country's heavy dependence on
nuclear-generated electricity.
The purpose of the amendment was to allow the handful of French cities that
handle their own gas supplies to go on doing so, not to break Gaz de
France's monopoly, explained officials. However, Gaz de France's management
is taking this legal threat seriously, given the eagerness of oil companies,
water distribution groups and local authorities to make inroads.
