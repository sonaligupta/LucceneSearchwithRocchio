FT  22 OCT 92 / International Company News: Australian bank closer to NZ
takeover victory

NATIONAL Australia Bank last night said it had acceptances for 85.61 per
cent of the ordinary shares in its ADollars 1.1bn (USDollars 786m) takeover
target, Bank of New Zealand. The bid, which closes on November 9, needs 90
per cent acceptance to be made unconditional.
NAB said institutional shareholders, holding more than 10m BNZ shares, had
accepted the offer, following a visit to New Zealand by Mr Don Argus, NAB
managing director. New Zealand's securities commission has ruled out an
inquiry into BNZ which could have affected NAB.
Standard and Poor's Australian Ratings removed NAB from negative credit
watch and said BNZ's rating would rise if the bid succeeded.
