FT  19 MAY 92 / Letter: Appropriate safeguards and reforms for pensions (3)


   From I M AITKEN


Sir, I was surprised to read your editorial 'Reform of the pension funds',
suggesting that the balance of advantage must to some degree shift from
final salary schemes to money purchase arrangements. You seem to suggest the
move, prima facie, to avoid the problems of surplus while, at the same time,
acknowledging that it would impose extra investment risk on the member. This
seems convoluted logic.
The pension provided by a money purchase scheme depends on the investment
returns achieved during the contribution period up to retirement and the
investment conditions prevailing at retirement. The employee is unable to
plan his retirement as he is unable to quantify his pension.
On the other hand, many employers are aware of these shortcomings and
consequently the vast majority of the larger pension schemes in the UK have
been established on the footing of a pension based on final salary. Such
schemes are able to assume that the employee will retire with a pension
which is a function of salary at or near to retirement for each year of
service. Fluctuations in investment conditions do not concern the employee -
he is assured of his pension. The employer is prepared, if necessary, to pay
an additional 'risk premium' to provide the investment safeguard and, in the
good years, he accepts a 'bonus' by way of a reduction in his contributions.
Final salary pension schemes have stood the test of time well and it would
be a shame if they were now abandoned on account of the current esoteric
talk regarding surplus.
