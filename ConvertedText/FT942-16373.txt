FT  11 APR 94 / Arts: Today's Television


   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY


Up to now there has been two episodes a week of the BBC's highest rated
programme, Eastenders, on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Today the lives of the
cockney stallholders and pub goers are extended into a third weekly episode,
starting at 8.00 on BBC1. To meet the threat, and of course as a spoiling
operation, ITV is moving British Television's highest rated programme,
Coronation Street forward by 10 minutes to start at 7.20 so that the
following programme, a movie, inherits the Street's millions and has 10
minutes to hook them and keep them from zapping.
British camera crews in South Africa must be having an awful job keeping one
another out of shot. Tonight in Panorama Michael Buerk reports on 'Mandela's
Promised Land' (9.30 BBC1) and Channel 4 shows the first in a three-part
series called Soweto - A History (10.55).
Two outstanding pieces of drama clash, but at least the first is a repeat.
Oranges Are Not The Only Fruit (10.10 BBC1) is about a girl growing up with
religious extremists. The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes (10.40) is a new
episode in ITV's series about the neurotic sleuth.
