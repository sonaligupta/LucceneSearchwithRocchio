FT  12 MAR 93 / Arts: Today's Television


   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY


It looks like an excellent day for sending off a cheque to your favourite
charity then going out and supporting the British economy by having a decent
dinner, or entertaining yourself and supporting the arts by going to the
theatre ..or better still, going to the theatre and then going on to dinner.
If you stay in to watch television you will find BBC1 monopolised by Total
Relief, one of those charity marathons which somehow manage to turn you
against even people that you previously liked and admired, and the other
three channels offering lacklustre schedules in which the occasional
highlight is something desperately familiar. Those confined to bed with flu
will just have to watch The Bill (8.00 ITV) a police series which sustains a
remarkably high standard; Cheers, the wise-cracking series about the
regulars in an American bar, which is equally reliable (9.30 C4); and Whose
Line Is It Anyway (10.30 C4) which is less consistent but almost always
produces a couple of hilarious moments . Best programme of the evening will
almost certainly be the repeat of Episode 8 in Edgar Reitz's serial Heimat
(11.20 BBC2).
