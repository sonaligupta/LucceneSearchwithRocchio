FT  12 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Dominant force in the bond markets


   From Mr MARK BROWN


Sir, John Plender ('Lull before the battle resumes', April 9/10) argues
that, if the dollar remains weak, European bond markets will be able to
decouple from the US Treasury market. This view is based on the proposition
that a weak dollar reflects outflows of long-term capital from the US into
European markets.
This may be the case, but the valuation effects of changes in the value of
the dollar works the other way and, at the present time, would seem to be
the more dominant force. When the price of dollar assets falls, everything
else equal, the price of non-dollar assets will be forced to fall in line to
maintain their relative attractiveness. A rise in the dollar, however, makes
dollar assets look more expensive to non-dollar investors. Hence, if the
dollar rises while the local price of dollar assets falls, the foreign
currency price of dollar assets remains the same and there is no need for
the price of non-dollar assets to change.
In practice, a rising dollar is another way of saying that some decoupling
of US and European markets is warranted by economic fundamentals, say
because of changing interest rate differentials. Since the first rise in US
interest rates in early February, European markets have suffered from the
fall-out in the US because the dollar did not rise as was generally
expected. In the last couple of weeks, however, the dollar has started to
strengthen and some decoupling has taken place.
