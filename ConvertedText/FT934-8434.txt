FT  16 NOV 93 / World Trade News: WWF seeks top role for environment


   By FRANCES WILLIAMS


   GENEVA


THE WWF-World Wide Fund for Nature yesterday called on the Apec summit to
ensure any new trade arrangements reflect environmental considerations from
the start.
Addressing environmental degradation as an afterthought was short-sighted,
as had been amply demonstrated by the North American Free Trade Agreement
and the Uruguay Round of Gatt trade talks, the Swiss-based environmental
organisation said .
Nafta negotiators were obliged to negotiate sub-optimal side agreements
later and these 'remain a source of dispute'. Uruguay Round negotiators
'have frequently claimed the initial omission of environmental issues cannot
be rectified later', according to Mr Charles Arden-Clarke, WWF policy
analyst.
The WWF is urging Apec to seek ways of making trade and environment policies
mutually supportive, as agreed at the UN 'Earth Summit' in Brazil last year.
