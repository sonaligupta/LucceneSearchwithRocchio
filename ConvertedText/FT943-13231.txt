FT  20 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazilian frost fails to excite
sugar trade


   By RICHARD MOONEY


The response of the sugar market to the recent frosts in Brazil, a big
exporter, is described by ED F. Man, the London trade house as 'anaemic'. It
suggests, in its latest sugar report, that damage to sugar-cane from the
frosts in southern Brazil has wiped out the overall production gain expected
earlier from increased output in the centre/south.
'After a record production of 7.02m tonnes in 1993-94, initially a further
6-8 per cent increase in sugar production was expected,' says Man. 'It is
this increase in production that has now been eroded.'
It sees as more serious the damage to the young cane 'with estimates of a
potential reduction for the 1995-96 crop'. But it says this is too far ahead
to have a serious effect on futures markets.
Nevertheless, 'worries about the Brazilian crop have set in motion an early
trail of concern for the 1994-95 crops in the region,' says Man. 'The
Argentine sugar industry, already suffering from an unstructured approach to
deregulation, has been affected by drought. . . There is some concern too
for the Dominican Republic and Mexico, whilst further degradation of the
Cuban 199394 crop does not bode well for next season.'
