FT  28 JUL 92 / UK Company News: 17.5% rise for RPS as margins improve


RPS Group, the environmental consultancy, saw pre-tax profits increase 17.5
per cent, from Pounds 302,000 to Pounds 355,000, in the first half of 1992.
The group reorganisation was almost complete. Margins rose substantially
compared with the second half of 1991, although turnover fell from Pounds
4.6m to Pounds 3.73m. Profit last time was struck after exceptional charges
of Pounds 121,000.
Progress in the second half would largely depend upon realisation of the
full benefit of cost reductions and more efficient staff utilisation,
thereby allowing margins to be raised further.
Earnings per share were 1.99p (1.64p) but the interim dividend is clipped to
1p (1.4p). On current projections the directors hoped to lift the total from
the previous 2p.
Over the six months gearing was cut from 40 per cent to 15 per cent. Mr
Brian Clouston, chairman, left the company as from yesterday as his contract
had expired; Mr Roger Looker takes over the chair.
