FT  22 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Exmoor Dual net assets dive


Exmoor Dual Investment Trust, the split-capital vehicle which concentrates
its portfolio primarily on similar such trusts, reported a net asset value
of 34.8p per ordinary share as at May 31, down from the value of 63.2p a
year earlier.
The figure of 61.1p per income share showed little change over the 12
months, while net asset value per zero coupon preference share improved from
158.4p to 178.9p.
Attributable revenue for the nine months to end-May amounted to Pounds
602,455 (Pounds 558,975) for earnings of 6.83p (6.34p) per income share.
A third interim dividend of 2.7p makes an unchanged total to date of 7.8p.
Directors reiterated that the total for the year would be maintained at
10.55p but that the distribution would probably have to be reduced next
year.
