FT  20 NOV 92 / International Company News: Deficit of SKr707m at Volvo


   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES


   STOCKHOLM


VOLVO, the Swedish motor vehicle group, reported a SKr707m (Dollars 116m)
loss after financial items for the first nine months, with declining demand
for cars and trucks in key markets more than offsetting the benefits of its
rationalisation programme.
The result compares with a SKr1.27bn profit for the same 1991 period.
Sales climbed to SKr58.8bn from SKr55.5bn, although, excluding acquisitions
and divestments, they were down by 1 per cent. The operating loss climbed to
SKr1.52bn from SKr1.25bn.
In the third quarter, the group made a loss after financial items of
SKr604m, compared with a SKr119m profit a year ago. The operating loss was
marginally down at SKr683m from SKr697m, thanks to reduced losses from the
company's car operations.
Earlier this month Volvo announced plans to close two of its three Swedish
car plants and shed 4,500 jobs as part of a continuing rationalisation
programme. The group says it has already cut annual costs by SKr4.3bn since
1990.
Car sales revenue rose 3 per cent to SKr31.6bn in the first nine months,
although only 228,900 vehicles were sold during the period, compared with
238,200 a year ago. Difficult market conditions persisted in the company's
three main markets, Sweden, UK and the US, and the operating result remained
negative.
The truck division also reported a loss for the period, although it was
profitable in the first nine months of 1991. Truck sales were down to 35,500
from 38,400, continuing the trend of the last five quarters. The company
warned that increased demand in North America this year would not offset the
overall downturn, mainly in Europe.
The group said Sweden's decision to float the krona yesterday would have a
negative short-term impact on its result.
