FT  13 MAR 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Bicycle saddle taken for a ride


SADDLE SORE cyclists could soon be sitting more comfortably thanks to
research which will be presented to the Ergonomics Society's annual
conference at Aston University in Birmingham next month.
Dutch ergonomists put cyclists in the saddle to measure the 'subjective'
experience of riding a bicycle. They found that cycling discomfort was a
problem that had forced some would-be cyclists off their bikes.
'The results make it clear that something is wrong with the present bicycle
saddles. Particularly for women it is hard to find a proper saddle,' said
Henri Christiaans, an ergonomist at Delf University.
Since there are clear anatomical differences between the sexes and
differences between age groups and fitness categories, the researchers
recommend that group-specific saddles should be developed and guidelines
drawn up to help cyclists choose a suitable saddle.
