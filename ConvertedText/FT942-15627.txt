FT  14 APR 94 / Observer: Erecting a successor


Finance ministries and central banks were never designed to agree about
everything - but things are particularly delicate in Japan just now. For the
latest note of discord has been struck over the identity of the Bank of
Japan's next boss.
BoJ officials and vice finance ministers take it in turns to pilot the
central bank. So when Yasushi Mieno, a BoJ man, steps down in December, the
fight is on between two ex Ministry of Finance bods, Yasuo Matsushita,
chairman of Sakura Bank, and Mitsuhide Yamaguchi, president of the Export
Import Bank of Japan.
The prospect of Yamaguchi spooks the bankers, as he is regarded as being far
too political an animal. They have found an ally in Minoru Nagaoka,
president of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, school friend of Mieno, and himself
once a vice finance minister. For Yamaguchi would be neatly off the scene
provided Nagaoka's 'personal' wishes are respected - that Yamaguchi take his
place at the TSE when he bows out in June.
But MoF, which boasts particularly close ties to Yamaguchi, is just about
equally unhappy with Matsushita. Ever since the latter was mentioned as heir
apparent to Mieno, he has faced a deluge of bad press, including allegations
of tax evasion, sourced in the popular weeklies to - why, anonymous MoF
bureaucrats.
Who cares about the course of the yen when there are other such fascinating
diversions with which to pass the time of day?
