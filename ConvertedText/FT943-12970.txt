FT  22 JUL 94 / US plea to UN over Haiti moves


   By MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS


   UNITED NATIONS


The US last night sought UN Security Council blessing for a possible
invasion of Haiti by troops of an American-led multinational coalition,
Michael Littlejohns writes from the United Nations. Ms Madeleine Albright,
the US ambassador, said a formal resolution being discussed with other
members would call for the use of 'all necessary means' to secure what she
termed 'a stable environment' in Haiti.
In UN parlance, 'all necessary means' includes military action, and
establishing stability in Haiti would require the removal of its military
regime.
Ms Albright told journalists she was proposing a two-phased resolution, to
approve a multinational force that would lead to a subsequent UN operation.
The UN's task would be to 'preserve that secure environment' achieved by the
international troops and ensure the implementation of the key elements of
the year-old Governors Island agreement. This has been renounced by General
Raoul Cedras, the Haitian military leader who signed the accord in New York.
As well as calling for the reinstatement of exiled President Jean-Bertrand
Aristide it provides for the reorganisation and training of the military and
police forces blamed for excesses that have caused thousands of Haitians to
flee the country.
