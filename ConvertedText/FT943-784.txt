FT  27 SEP 94 / International Company News: Italian metal group breaks even


   By ANDREW HILL

Europa Metalli-LMI, the Italian metals group with interests in France, Spain
and Germany, broke even at an operating level in the first half of 1994.
This follows two years of restructuring and heavy losses and provided
further evidence of improved demand for industrial goods.
Europa Metalli, which specialises in the production of semi-finished goods
and copper alloys, yesterday reported a small first-half net consolidated
loss of L6.6bn (Dollars 4.24m) against a loss of L50.3bn in the equivalent
period last year, and L131.6bn in the whole of 1993. The company said the
result had been affected by a poor performance at its Spanish operation,
which was being restructured, and a small loss in defence products. Group
turnover increased 5 per cent to L1,813bn.
Europa Metalli is the main operating component of the group of companies
headed by Mr Luigi Orlando, one of Italy's best-known businessmen. It is
controlled by Societa Metallurgica Italiana, another quoted Italian company,
47 per cent of which is in turn owned by the quoted holding company Generale
Industrie Metallurgiche. The Florence-based company confirmed it was
continuing to study ways of improving the group's structure, and reinforcing
its financial position.
The company added if the economic recovery continued, Europa Metalli would
be able to repeat its small first-half profit on industrial activities in
the full year.
KM-kabelmetal, the company's quoted German subsidiary, made a profit of
DM10.7m (Dollars 6.9m) in the first half, against a loss of DM4.4m in the
equivalent 1993 period.
Trefimetaux, the French operation, also returned to break even, having lost
FFr39.5m (Dollars 7.48m) in the first half of 1993.
