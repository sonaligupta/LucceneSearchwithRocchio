FT  16 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Vibroplant shares dip after 27% fall


   By PETER PEARSE


VIBROPLANT yesterday reported a 27 per cent fall in pre-tax profits, from
Pounds 2.03m to Pounds 1.48m, for the six months to September 30.
Mr Jeremy Pilkington, chairman of the plant hire group, described the
outcome as 'not terribly satisfactory' and 'a disappointing performance'.
The shares fell 10p to 89p.
However, Mr Pilkington said that continuing strong cash flow had further
reduced borrowings to Pounds 27m-Pounds 28m (Pounds 32m), bringing gearing
down from 58 per cent to 46 per cent.
He estimated it would fall below 40 per cent at the year-end.
Capital expenditure grew to Pounds 6m (Pounds 4m) in the half.
The interim dividend is held at 1.22p, payable from earnings of 2.08p
(2.93p) per share.
Behind the profits decline lay a slump in pre-tax profits from the US
operations to just Pounds 62,000 (Pounds 810,000), while in the UK they rose
to Pounds 1.42m (Pounds 1.22m).
Mr Pilkington said that dollar revenues were down 10 per cent, but that
translated into sterling they advanced 4 per cent.
One factor in the US decline were costs of Dollars 300,000 (Pounds 199,000)
relating to closures in the Mid-West last time.
However, the main transatlantic problem continued to be California, where
prices in hire businesses across the board had fallen some 25 per cent due
to recession in the construction, defence and aerospace industries.
'So long as we have no losses in the region, we don't want to throw the
towel in,' Mr Pilkington said.
In the UK, trading conditions continued to be poor, and the profits rise
derived from falls in depreciation to Pounds 3.38m (Pounds 3.73m) and in
interest payable to Pounds 228,000 (Pounds 614,000). Trading profits were
down at Pounds 5.03m (Pounds 5.57m).
The UK side has been refocused into six specialist businesses, a move
designed to encourage managers to 'stay close to their markets' and to
promote product innovation. Prices have been 'a little better', said Mr
Pilkington, and bad debts, which in the last full year were 4 per cent of
turnover, were now 'usefully below 3 per cent'.
Alphabet Event Hire, the toilets and corporate hospitality unit hire company
which made losses last year, had a busier summer and costs have been cut
with its back office moving into Vibroplant's Harrogate head office.
Group turnover edged ahead to Pounds 36.9m (Pounds 36.2m).
