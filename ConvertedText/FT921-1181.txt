FT  25 MAR 92 / Time 'wasted by bosses'


BOSSES waste an average of six working weeks a year doing tasks they should
delegate to secretaries, the Industrial Society, an independent body that
promotes good industrial relations, said yesterday.
Ms Juliet Hepburn, the society's head of secretarial development, said time
wasted cost companies about Pounds 5,700 a year for each senior executive.
Every week, the society said, the average senior executive wastes 150
minutes sifting post, 80 minutes making diary arrangements, 30 minutes
arranging meetings and 15 minutes on travel arrangements.
