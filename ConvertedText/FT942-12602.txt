Hang Seng down

   TOKYO


Most investors were absent ahead of the Golden Week holidays, but buying by
financial institutions and investment trust funds helped stocks post modest
gains, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei index rose 100.22 to 19,729.15 after a low of 19,612.82 and a
high of 19,813.86 just before the close. Volume was 210m shares, the lowest
for the year as many investors refrained from activity due to the string of
holidays which start on Friday, and uncertainty over domestic politics and
currency movements.
Small lot buying amid low volume pushed share prices higher along with a
rise in futures prices. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose
3.59 to 1,601.51 while the Nikkei 300 gained 0.57 to 292.70. Gainers led
losers by 514 to 457, with 193 issues remaining unchanged. In London, the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.98 to 1,307.83.
Individual investors were seen trading speculative shares. Some traders see
the moves connected to the political unrest as the possibility of an early
election has increased due to the Socialist Democratic party's departure
from the coalition government earlier this week.
Sumitomo Coal Mining, the most active issue of the day, rose Y38 to Y993 on
speculative trading. Pacific Metals, which fell Y15 to Y455, was initially
higher on early buying by individual investors, but closed lower on profit
taking.
Remarks by the chairman of the Japan Iron and Steel Federation that steel
demand was bottoming out, supported steel stocks. Sanyo Special Steel rose
Y8 to Y440 and Kobe Steel advanced Y3 to Y288.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, a benchmark for investor confidence, fell
Y1,000 to Y885,000.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 44.79 to 21,957.33 in volume of 14.2m shares.
Nintendo rose Y60 to Y6,620 on bargain hunting.
