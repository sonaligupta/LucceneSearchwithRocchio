Passenger traffic at BAA's seven airports reached a record 82m in the
financial year to April 1, up 5.6 per cent on a year earlier, Jenny Luesby
writes.
The highest growth was at Stansted Airport, up 42 per cent on the previous
year, followed by Southampton at 22 per cent and Edinburgh at 21 per cent.
But the number of passengers passing through Aberdeen fell 6 per cent.
Cargo traffic through BAA airports rose 17 per cent in March compared with
the same period last year, taking annual traffic in the financial year to
1.2m tonnes, 13 per cent higher than the previous year.
