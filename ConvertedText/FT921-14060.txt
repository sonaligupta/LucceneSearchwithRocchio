FT  17 JAN 92 / Proposals too late, say members in US

REACTION AMONG US-based Names to the Lloyd's reform package remained
tentative yesterday. Many stressed that they needed to read the entire
document and were basing their limited comments on newspaper reports. If a
prevailing sentiment could be gleaned, it was that the proposed measures had
come at least a decade too late.
Mr Dale Jenkins, one of the US Names involved in legal action against
Lloyd's, said: 'They're trying to rectify the mistakes of the past. Too bad
they didn't do it earlier.'
He added that even with the proposed changes, Lloyd's would have limitations
as an investment vehicle. 'There needs to be a complete housekeeping of the
management there,' he said.
Mr Dale Schreiber, an attorney at New York law firm Proskauer Rose Goez &
Mendelsohn, which is bringing a lawsuit against Lloyd's on behalf of more
than 60 Names, said that the firm needed to study the report and was
unlikely to take a view for several days.
Some US Names did welcome the suggestion that they should have access to
syndicate information, a say in big transactions and certain other rights.
From Albany, Dr Joel Spiro, another Name involved in the Proskauer Rose
lawsuit, said: 'I would agree in principle that there should be access to
financial information and meetings'
There are more than 2,000 Lloyd's Names in the US, a fairly small proportion
of the total of 26,500 Names. However, they have historically committed
relatively large amounts of capital to the market.
Therefore the legal battles in the US could carry particularly damaging
implications for the insurance institution.
