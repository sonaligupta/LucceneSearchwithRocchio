FT  27 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Concerns over US
policies inhibit general trading


   By ROBERT PATTON


   TOKYO


Stocks drifted lower in thin trading, with most participants sitting on the
sidelines,
The Nikkei 225 average eased 19.31 to 19,814.36 after a three-day weekend;
Tokyo markets were closed on Friday for a Japanese national holiday. Small
early gains lifted the key index to a high of 19,922.4; the day's low was
19,780.5.
Declines outscored advances by 526 to 467, with 193 issues unchanged. Volume
fell to an estimated 250m shares from the 353.7m traded last Thursday. Most
traders were cautious over foreign exchange movements. Adding to market
uncertainty was the looming Friday deadline for the imposition of Super 301
trade sanctions by the US.
The capital-weighted Nikkei 300 index inched ahead 0.22 to 290.07, while
first-section Topix stocks closed at 1,585.21, up 0.99 from Thursday.
The second section index receded 9.44 to 2,237.02, with an estimated 7.25m
shares changing hands. Japan Telecom, widely regarded as a market indicator
ahead of the upcoming listing of Japan Tobacco on October 27, continued to
decline. Listed on the second section, the stock fell Y100,000 to Y4.05m,
its lowest value since listing on September 6. DDI, another second-section
telecom stock, dipped Y8,000 to Y871,000, but Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
remained flat at Y885,000.
In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index finished 0.89 firmer at 1,297.37.
A Sunday newspaper report that electronic parts maker Hosiden will spend
Y60bn to build a large thin-film transistor liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD)
plant in Kobe, western Japan, raised Hosiden shares Y80 to Y2,280. Hosiden
supplies all LCD cockpit display panels used in Boeing 777 aircraft.
Other high-technology issues lost ground. Toshiba slipped Y4 to Y747, NEC
was Y10 softer at Y1,170 and Oki Electric shed Y20 to Y760.
In Osaka the OSE average gained 28.18 points at 22,101.53 in volume of 60.8m
shares.
Roundup
Worries about the outlook for interest rates after today's US Federal Open
Market Committee meeting were an inhibition to trading in some Pacific Rim
markets.
Bombay opened as normal but brokers refused to transact business, in
sympathy with 10 brokers whose offices were gutted in the fire on Friday.
The exchange is expected to reopen today.
SEOUL made headway after Friday's consolidation to end at another all-time
high as early strength in financial and banking shares spread to other
issues. However, profit-taking in primary blue chips limited the advance.
The composite index closed 7.71 stronger at 1,045.12, just off a record
intraday peak of 1,047.34 set in the morning.
The sub-group index for banks rose 11.26, or 1.6 per cent, to a fresh high
for the year of 696.06, but profit-taking was seen in last week's best
performers.
Samsung slipped Won1,900 to Won138,100 and Posco declined by Won500 to
Won86,600.
TAIPEI put on 1.5 per cent amid late demand for banking stocks. The weighted
index finished 103.74 higher at 7,025.76, although turnover was slow at
TDollars 48.4bn.
Financials reversed early falls and supported the market. Chang Hwa Bank put
on TDollars 8 at TDollars 209, First Commercial Bank TDollars 9 at TDollars
205 and Hwa Nan Bank TDollars 9 at TDollars 229.
Closed-end funds also attracted buying on hopes that they would be converted
into open-end funds soon. Kwang Hua Fortune, the most active issue, climbed
20 cents to TDollars 13.15.
HONG KONG saw modest gains, although the market remained overshadowed by
concern about the outlook for US interest rates.
The Hang Seng index was up 11.16 at 9,643.63 after an early high of
9,700.92, as turnover improved to HKDollars 3.4bn from Friday's HKDollars
3.07bn.
Among the seven stocks which will enter the Hang Seng index later this year
and early in 1995, Sino Land moved forward 45 cents to HKDollars 8.75 and
Oriental Press put on 40 cents at HKDollars 5.30.
Stocks which had been widely expected to join the main index, but failed to
make last Friday's list, fell sharply. First Pacific dropped 47.5 cents, or
8.4 per cent, to HKDollars 5.15, Guoco Group lost HKDollars 1.60, or 4.1 per
cent, at HKDollars 37.60 and Henderson Investment shed 37.5 cents, or 5.1
per cent, to HKDollars 6.975.
Lai Sun and Winsor both declined steeply after the announcement that they
would be removed from the index, following their underperformance of the
market. Lai Sun retreated HKDollars 1.10, or 6.9 per cent, to HKDollars
14.90 and Winsor was 60 cents, or 5.4 per cent, lower at HKDollars 10.55.
On the opposite tack, shipping company IMC picked up 42.5 cents, or 7.7 per
cent, to HKDollars 5.95 on institutional buying following signs of recovery
in the industry.
SYDNEY edged forward in quiet conditions ahead of today's FOMC meeting. The
All Ordinaries index closed 2.3 higher at 2,030.0 as rises by golds and some
industrial stocks offset falls in finance and some resource sectors.
WELLINGTON eased, with the threat of higher interest rates acting as a
disincentive. The NZSE-40 Capital index finished 4.73 off at 2,075.80 in
very low turnover of NZDollars 19.49m.
SINGAPORE was softer, although prices showed some resilience and the Straits
Times Industrial index closed only 2.24 down at 2,299.81. Over-the-counter
Malaysian shares were dampened by heavy profit-taking in the afternoon,
after an unexpectedly strong start.
Yeo Hiap Seng Malaysia lost 45 cents at SDollars 8.45 after the Malaysian
authorities' move to calm recent feverish speculation by making it a
'designated security'.
KUALA LUMPUR was worried about interest rates and the composite index gave
up 13.14 at 1,157.18.
Against the trend, Econstates and Actacorp, which resumed trading after
recent suspensions, were sharply higher. Econstates rose MDollars 2.65, or
67.9 per cent, to MDollars 6.55 on the purchase of a port developer which
has been awarded the privatised Klang West Port.
Actacorp climbed MDollars 1.75, or 29.4 per cent, to MDollars 7.70 on news
that a businessman has bought a 26.6 per cent stake.
MANILA was pulled down by declining blue chips, and the composite index lost
15.16 at 2,944.20. Heavy selling was seen in a number of issues as investors
cashed in profits, including Metropolitan Bank & Trust, which fell 35 pesos,
or 4.2 per cent, to 795 pesos.
