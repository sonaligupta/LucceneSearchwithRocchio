FT  29 APR 94 / UK Company News: Hicking Pentecost expansion


   By GRAHAM DELLER


Hicking Pentecost, the textile and industrial products group, is buying the
Barbour Campbell industrial thread manufacturing business for a maximum
Pounds 8.93m, writes Graham Deller.
The deal is to be partly funded by a placing and open offer to shareholders,
fully underwritten by Credit Lyonnais Laing, to raise about Pounds 7.9m net
of expenses.
Barbour Campbell, a former Hanson offshoot, was acquired by its management
in 1989 for Pounds 25.8m. After expansion it lapsed into losses, blaming the
recession and high interest rates. It sold its troubled linen yarn
subsidiary in September last year; the remaining business being acquired by
Hicking made operating profits of Pounds 1.6m in the 18 months to March 26
1993, on turnover of Pounds 44.2m.
Consideration will be satisfied by up to Pounds 400,000 cash and the issue
of up to 4.06m shares at 220p apiece. The shares rose 7p to 234p yesterday.
An initial Pounds 5.53m is payable on completion with further payments
dependent on profit performance.
CLL has conditionally placed 4.13m shares with institutions at 210p per
share, subject to clawback on a 1-for-4 basis at the same price.
Hicking also said it expected to achieve pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.4m
(Pounds 2.85m) for the 12 months to March 31 1994. Estimated earnings per
share were 15.25p (13.01p). A second interim dividend of 3.05p is declared,
making a total for the year of 4.6p (4p).
