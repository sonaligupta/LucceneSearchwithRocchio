FT  05 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Acsis seeks shareholder approval for
refinancing


   By MAGGIE URRY


ACSIS GROUP, the nursing management company, is asking shareholders to
support a refinancing of its Pounds 12.6m debts so that it can continue
trading. It has broken covenants and repayment commitments on its loans and
had a deficit on reserves of Pounds 49.8m at the end of 1992.
The group, which yesterday announced a reduced pre-tax loss of Pounds 9.28m
(Pounds 21.7m) for 1992, had its shares suspended at 1 1/4 p on June 28. It
has undergone significant changes in its activities and management in recent
years and agreed a Pounds 2m refinancing in 1991.
Acsis owes Midland Bank Pounds 12.1m and other secured bank debts total
Pounds 500,000. It also owes Pounds 867,500 to the vendors of NMS, a US
nursing company now its main trading arm, which includes Mr Ephraim Barsam,
Acsis' chairman. Mr Barsam said Acsis intends to concentrate on the health
care market and will change its name to Premier Health.
The refinancing proposals involve the issue of 265.2m shares, 91.7 per cent
of the enlarged capital. Existing shareholders will be offered 44m new
shares at 1p each and there will be a 12 into 1 consolidation.
Under the proposals, Midland's loan will be cut to Pounds 3.1m, but will
bear no interest initially, and the bank will hold 5.3 per cent of the
increased share capital. The NMS vendors will hold up to 33.4 per cent of
the shares, and Foreign and Colonial Enterprise Trust will subscribe Pounds
434,000 for a 15 per cent stake.
A capital reduction will cut the deficit on the profit and loss account so
that Acsis can return to the dividend list.
