FT  24 MAR 92 / UN says Iraq has destroyed Scud missiles


   By MARK NICHOLSON, Middle East Correspondent


UNITED NATIONS ballistics inspectors in Iraq have confirmed that Iraq has
destroyed and buried a number of Scud missiles and other weapons which they
had failed to declare to the UN until late last week.
UN officials are also studying plans submitted by the Iraqis for the
destruction of manufacturing equipment related to its Scud missile programme
 -equipment Iraq had refused to destroy during a previous UN inspection.
However, UN officials said it was 'too early to tell' if Iraq was going to
hold good to its promise, made in a letter to the UN special commission
charged with eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction last Friday, to
make 'full, final and complete' disclosure of its weapons of mass destruct
ion.
A 35-strong team of inspectors reported finding evidence of destroyed
missiles in three sites. Mr Derek Boothby, the team leader, said his
investigators would visit several more sites in the next few days.
Iraq is believed to have declared the secret destruction of around 100 Scud
missiles. President Bush said that yesterday Iraq had moved in the right
direction towards complying with UN resolutions: 'I think our firmness has
now caused them to back down once again,' he told a television interviewer.
