FT  27 APR 94 / International Company News: UCB held back by downturn in
chemical sector


   By LIONEL BARBER


   BRUSSELS


The downturn in chemicals and currency turmoil in Europe led to a 17 per
cent profits fall last year at UCB, the Belgian chemical and pharmaceutical
group.
Group pre-tax profits fell to BFr2.03bn (Dollars 56.4m) from BFr2.4bn in
1992. However, an exceptional gain of BFr880m, due mainly to the sale of
Vel, the group's Belgian chemicals subsidiary, helped lift after-tax profits
in 1993 by 7 per cent to BFr2.4bn.
Mr Georges Jacobs, chief executive, expressed optimism about prospects for
1994. Economic recovery in Europe was under way and profits would be 'at a
good level', he said.
UCB specialises in plastics, pharmaceuticals, films and packaging. In spite
of a 3 per cent fall in net sales in 1993 to BFr45.9bn, against BFr 47.31bn,
the company created 199 jobs. The workforce at the end of 1993 totalled
8,104.
UCB's profits were helped by the success of Zyrtec, its anti-allergic drug.
Mr Jacobs hoped the drug would win approval by the US Food and Drug
Administration for marketing in the US before the end of the year.
Mr Jacobs said UCB was looking for acquisitions in its core businesses, but
declined to speculate on the timing. UCB wanted to expand sales outside
Europe in fast-growing markets in Thailand and Malaysia, in addition to
Japan and Korea.
'We can't just sell, we must produce locally,' he said.
UCB is recommending a total net dividend of BFr430 per ordinary share,
against the BFr420 paid for 1992.
