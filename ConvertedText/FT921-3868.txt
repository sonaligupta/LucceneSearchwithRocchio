WOODCHESTER Investments, the Dublin-based leasing and financial services
group, yesterday announced the finalising of its acquisition of UDT Bank in
the Irish Republic from Hill Samuel Bank for a cash consideration of IPounds
23.4m (Pounds 21.8m).
According to Woodchester, the latest audited state- ments of UDT showed its
total assets to be in excess of IPounds 300m at October 31 1991. Net assets
stood at IPounds 19.5m. Its profit before taxation was IPounds 4m.
In a statement announcing the deal's finalising Woodchester said that it
believed UDT's activities 'are complemen-tary to those of Woodchester Bank
and that the merger of the two operations will strengthen considerably the
enlarged bank's market position'.
Woodchester's acquisition will expand the banking arm of its business,
particularly in the region of Cork, Ireland's second largest city, which has
a flourishing pharma- ceuticals and electronics industry.
Woodchester's core business is in equipment and vehicle leasing in Ireland
and the UK.
In its last annual report Woodchester reported total assets of IPounds
1.1bn. It is 45 per cent owned by the Credit Lyonnais group, which increased
its stake from 29.8 per cent in January 1991.
