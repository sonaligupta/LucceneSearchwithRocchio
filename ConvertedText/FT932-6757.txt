FT  27 MAY 93 / Ferry company may be sold off


   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent


THE GOVERNMENT is to study the possible privatisation of Caledonian
MacBrayne, the state-owned ferry company which provides services to islands
off the west coast of Scotland.
The idea of privatising Caledonian MacBrayne, which enjoys an annual
government subsidy of about Pounds 7m, is likely to be an emotive one. It
has already caused protests from Labour and Scottish National party MPs, and
will worry some Conservatives.
Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, said the Scottish Office would seek
consultants to review the organisation and structure of the company
'including the possible scope for introducing private- sector participation
in the provision of Caledonian MacBrayne's services'.
The government would consider both public ownership and privatisation. In
the case of privatisation, Mr Lang said in a written parliamentary answer,
it would investigate the scope for 'greater employee involvement', a hint at
the possibility of management buy-outs.
Mr Lang said the government was committed to giving continued financial
support to 'lifeline shipping services.' He saw 'greater efficiency and
effectiveness in subsidy and service provision as leading to better services
for the consumer'.
Caledonian MacBrayne operates ferry services to the inner and outer Hebrides
and in the Clyde estuary, and employs 830 people.
The Scottish Office last looked at the possible privatisation of it in 1988.
It is thought to have approached at least two shipping groups in an attempt
to sell the company but was told that it would be impossible to make many of
the routes profitable.
Since then the company's efficiency has improved and traffic has increased.
Opposition parties argue that privatisation would lead to higher fares and
fewer sailings.
