FT  16 MAR 94 / Howard changes cautioning guide


   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent


New guidelines on the cautioning of suspects, which are likely to increase
the number of prosecutions and ultimately the size of the prison population,
were sent to police forces in England and Wales yesterday by Mr Michael
Howard, the home secretary.
The move follows widespread public concern that too many offenders were
escaping prosecution through inappropriate use of cautioning by police.
Mr Howard said that while 87 per cent of cautions were effective, there was
a need to reduce the number of repeat cautions, stop cautions for serious
offences and ensure a more consistent application by police forces.
The guidelines say:
Police should consider whether a caution is likely to be effective and
whether it is appropriate to the offence.
Juveniles should not necessarily be cautioned rather than prosecuted just
because they are young.
Cautions should only be used in exceptional circumstances for serious
offences.
Multiple cautions should only be considered where the subsequent offence is
trivial or where some time has elapsed since the original caution.
Mr Harry Fletcher, general secretary of the National Association of
Probation Officers, said abandoning repeat cautions would result in 60,000
extra prosecutions a year and an increase in the prison population.
In 1992, there were 321,000 cautions for all offences, compared with 279,000
in 1991, and 1,735 cautions for more serious, indictable offences.
The Home Office estimates there will be 50,000 fewer cautions each year but
not all of these cases will result in prosecutions.
