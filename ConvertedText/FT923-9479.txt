FT  05 AUG 92 / Complaints about BR rise to record level


   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent


COMPLAINTS ABOUT British Rail reached record levels in the year to March,
the rail passengers' statutory watchdog reported yesterday.
But the Central Transport Consultative Committee blamed the government more
than BR, saying it had failed to allocate enough resources to the railways.
Major-General Lennox Napier, the committee's chairman, said: 'I give British
Rail credit for doing its best with outdated equipment and rolling stock
and, in my view, inadequate levels of long-term investment.'
The committee's report acknowledged that big increases in funding had been
authorised by the government , but had left BR Pounds 3.1bn short of the
Pounds 7.4bn it needed over the next three years.
Badly needed projects such as rolling stock replacement for Network
SouthEast commuter services and the upgrading of the west coast main line
had therefore been put on indefinite hold.
The committee said other ways of financing investment had to be explored,
such as leasing deals and allowing BR to tap the international money
markets.
Complaints rose from 8,053 to 8,371 in 1991-92, an increase of 3.9 per cent.
This was more than twice the number in 1985-86 and over four times that in
1980-81.
Top five categories of complaint were punctuality, suitability of services
to passenger requirements, the amount of information at stations, fares, and
refunds and claims.
Maj-Gen Napier said he gave two cheers for the Passenger's Charter but it
should have set tougher targets and allowed more scope for compensation
claims.
He said he was not against privatisation but there was a risk that the
government could use it as an excuse to cut investment.
