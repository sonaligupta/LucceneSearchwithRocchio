FT  26 JUN 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report


   By REUTER


London COCOA futures recovered from fresh 16 1/2 -year lows to record slight
gains, but dealers said they were under no illusions that the long-term
downtrend had ended. 'The small rise was down to bargain-hunting. Nothing's
happened to change our bearishness,' said one trader. Talk of selling by
Ghana and Ivory Coast, with the threat of more to come, kept the market
under pressure. New York cocoa futures were firm at midday on the softness
of the dollar. GOLD and PLATINUM added slightly to earlier gains in
afternoon trading on the London bullion market. But trade remained patchy
and neither metal looked like breaking out of current tight ranges, dealers
said. Platinum dealers in particular faced a dilemma; they were reluctant to
go short with the situation in South Africa so uncertain, but downside
pressure has been building recently due to a perceived slowdown in demand as
major economies show signs of weakness. In Chicago WHEAT prices were higher
at midday on forecasts for rain that could delay harvesting, traders said.
Thunder storms in the southern Great Plains continue to hamper wheat cutting
in Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas.
