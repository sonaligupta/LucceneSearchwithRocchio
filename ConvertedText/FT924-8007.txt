FT  13 NOV 92 / Observer: Moving target


Thriller writer Ken Follett is a master of surprise. He may be a staunch
supporter of Britain's Labour party, but he was also a big fan of maverick
Texan Ross Perot's presidential ambitions.
It has to be remembered that Follett wrote On the Wings of Eagles, the true
story of how two employees of Perot were rescued from Iran during the 1979
revolution. During the campaign Perot was handing the book out like a
calling card.
Follett was also in the vanguard of the opposition to Rupert Murdoch's
takeover of his publisher Collins. But now he has changed his tune and
signed up to make a multi-million mini-series, Spread Eagle, for Sky
Television which is half-owned by his old enemy Rupert Murdoch.
'If you can't beat them, join them,' trilled Follett, adding that, 'Murdoch
doesn't own a majority of Sky. That's important.'
