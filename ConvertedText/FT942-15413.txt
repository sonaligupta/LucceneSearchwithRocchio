FT  15 APR 94 / Talks to avert industrial action


Negotiations which aim to avert selective industrial action on the UK's
largest engineering construction sites began yesterday.
The talks were provoked by the unions' opposition to an imposed pay freeze.
However, the negotiations, which are scheduled to last a couple of days,
will review the whole of the 'big sites' agreement covering 20,000
mechanical construction workers on sites such as Sizewell B.
