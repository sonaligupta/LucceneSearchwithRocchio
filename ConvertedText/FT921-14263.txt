FT  16 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Equities pause before firming
to set new peak

Wall Street
AFTER Tuesday's sharp gains, US stock markets paused for breath yesterday,
although a steady stream of demand from individual investors ensured that
share prices ended at new highs, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 12.30 at 3,258.50,
another all-time peak. The more broadly based Standard & Poor's 500 ended a
slight 0.33 firmer at 420.77, while the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter
stocks powered ahead 5.07 to 630.82, both record closes. Turnover on the New
York SE was very heavy at 312.8m shares, and rises finally led falls by
1,138 to 660.
One of the main influences behind Tuesday's 60-point Dow rally was the rush
of individual investor money out of maturing certificates of deposit and
equally low-yielding money market funds and into equities, which in the
current low interest rate environment appear attractive compared to many
other assets. That movement continued yesterday.
Another feature of recent trading has been investors switching out of
certain sectors and into others, searching for the sector that will
outperform the market.
A notable victim of this intra-market trading yesterday was the drugs
sector, which lost ground amid concerted selling. Merck dropped Dollars 4 to
Dollars 156 1/8 , Pfizer Dollars 4 1/8 to Dollars 79 3/8 , Glaxo Dollars 1
1/8 to Dollars 32 3/4 and Schering-Plough Dollars 3 to Dollars 64 3/4 .
Airline issues appeared to have benefited from selling in other areas of the
market. AMR, parent of American Airlines, advanced Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars
74 1/4 in spite of reporting a fourth-quarter net loss of Dollars 125m after
a Dollars 59.6m charge to cover write-down of aircraft values.
Among other airlines, UAL rose Dollars 4 3/8 to Dollars 156 3/4 , USAir
added Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 16 5/8 and Delta forged ahead Dollars 4 3/4
to Dollars 75 1/4 . The sector may have been helped by positive comments
from AMR's senior management about the outlook for pricing in the industry.
IBM moved up Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 95 1/8 on reports that Mr Donald
Young, an analyst at Shearson Lehman, had told his firm's sales force that
the computer giant could produce a pleasant surprise in its fourth-quarter
earnings report tomorrow.
Citicorp continued to race ahead, adding Dollars 2 1/8 at Dollars 15 1/8 in
turnover of 12.2m shares. The stock has been in great demand this week, and
yesterday it received a further boost when Goldman Sachs upgraded its
investment opinion of Citicorp and put the bank on its recommended list.
In the same sector, Bank of Boston put on Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 14 3/4 on
news that its merger talks with rival New England banking group Shawmut
National had been terminated. Shawmut firmed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 10 3/8
.
Canada
TORONTO stocks continued their rally in heavy trading, posting gains for the
sixth straight day. The composite index added 21.7 at 3,656.7, another
52-week high. Rises outscored declines by 388 to 234 after a volume of 41.1m
shares, exceeding Tuesday's 35.2m.
Nova fell CDollars  1/2 to CDollars 7 1/2 on more than 2.2m shares traded.
The company said it will issue for sale in Canada 35m common shares at
CDollars 7.15 apiece. It also announced that it has received letters of
credit to finance initial costs of Nova facilities for the proposed Pacific
Gas Transmission and Altamont pipelines.
Quebecor said it plans a two-for-one stock split on its class 'A' and 'B'
shares. The 'A' put on CDollars  3/4 to CDollars 25 1/4 but the 'B' lost
CDollars 1/2 to CDollars 25 1/4.
