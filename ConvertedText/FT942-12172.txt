FT  30 APR 94 / Briefcase, Q&A: Indexation losses


The table published on April 16 in the Weekend FT's series on capital gains
tax suggests that indexation losses relating to disposals made between
November 30 1993 and April 5 1994 may exceptionally be carried forward to
the 1994/95 tax year if they were not all needed to reduce the net gain for
1993/94 to the value of the annual allowance (Pounds 5,800). Is this
correct?
What is the position now regarding claims for 'negligible value' made in the
tax returns for 1993/94? The original Budget proposals, I understand,
provided that no indexation losses would be allowed on any such claims made
after November 30 1993, irrespective of the actual date when the assets in
question were deemed valueless.
Indexation losses, of course, will now be allowed; but is it correct that
such indexation losses must be considered to have been incurred after
November 30 and, thus, that they must in all circumstances come out of the
Pounds 10,000 limit?
The answer to the first question is yes. The answer to the second also is
yes as a result of the schedule added to the Finance Bill on the day you
wrote to us.
