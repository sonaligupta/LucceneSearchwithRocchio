FT  20 APR 94 / EBRD shelves Gdansk project: European News Digest


   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER


The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has suspended its
backing for an Ecu68m (Pounds 53m) water treatment project in Gdansk after
allegations that the local water company was operating on land confiscated
from a Jewish family by the Nazis. The bank's decision follows a two-year
campaign by Mrs Ewa Szpicberg, a Polish Holocaust survivor, who says that
some of the water company's facilities in the Polish port city are on
property which was owned by her family before the second world war. Mrs Anne
Wibble, chairwoman of the bank's governors, wrote to Mrs Szpicberg: 'In my
view it is very important that the legal aspects concerning property rights
are clarified before approval of possible EBRD participation in projects of
this kind.'
