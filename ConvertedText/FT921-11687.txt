FT  30 JAN 92 / The Disarmament Race: Deployment of submarines to go ahead -
Britain and Trident


   By DAVID WHITE


NUCLEAR ARMS cuts proposed by US President George Bush will not deter
Britain from going ahead with plans to deploy Trident ballistic-missile
submarines, with much greater potential firepower than its current Polaris
system, Mr Tom King, defence secretary, said yesterday, writes David White.
The Bush proposals, which include cutting submarine warheads, would not
affect the UK's plans for obtaining Trident II missiles from the US.
However, he did not specifically rule out the possibility that Britain's
Trident force, due for deployment in the mid-1990s, might go to sea with
less than its full load of warheads.
The new submarines - three under construction and a fourth due to be ordered
soon - will carry up to 16 missiles, with up to eight British-made warheads
each, compared with two or three on the current system. This means a maximum
of 128 warheads per boat.
Mr King said that the UK needed the full fleet of four submarines for
'operational security'. They would carry 'the minimum load necessary' - he
did not say what that would be.
Britain had to pose a credible threat of unacceptable damage to an
aggressor, he said, arguing that such a threat was not in the same league as
that of the US or the former Soviet Union.
However, Britain has previously felt obliged to conform with the spirit of
US-Soviet nuclear arms agreements. Plans for an air-launched missile were
geared to a range of under 500km, for instance.
