FT  21 OCT 92 / Big rise forecast in Russian jobless


   By JOHN LLOYD


UNEMPLOYMENT in Russia is likely to soar to higher levels than those in east
European countries, according to a study just completed by the International
Labour Organisation, writes John Lloyd.
The report, which will form the backdrop to a conference opening today in
Moscow, covered over 500 enterprises employing more than half a million
workers. It shows that the decline in production and employment is
accelerating in every sector of industry.
Enterprises have cut around 15 per cent of their workforces in the past
year, according to the study, and nearly half those surveyed expect a
employment to fall further in 1993. The majority of enterprises said they
could maintain current output with an average of 18 per cent fewer workers.
Nearly 70 per cent of the enterprises surveyed planned to privatise
themselves in the coming year  - a change likely to lead to further loss of
jobs.
In addition, the report says, capacity utilisation in Russian companies fell
from around 83 per cent in 1989 to 75 per cent in mid-1992. Chemicals, basic
metals and engineering are the sectors most badly hit.
Mr Guy Standing, head of the ILO's East European office, said official
figures showing a 1-2 per cent unemployment rate in Russia grossly
underestimated the problem.
