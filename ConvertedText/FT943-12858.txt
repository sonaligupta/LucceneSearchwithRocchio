FT  22 JUL 94 / Observer: Well-informed


Charles Cox, head of public sector business at the UK information technology
company Hoskyns, has never concealed his criticisms of the government's
approach to contracting-out and its failure to deliver the potential
benefits.
Many others in the IT world agree, but have kept quiet, fearing that to
speak out would count against them.
But having the courage of one's convictions doesn't always land you in hot
water; Hoskyns has just won the contract for providing all IT services at
the DTI.
