FT  23 JUL 94 / Markets Report: Dollar rallies


   By PHILIP GAWITH


The dollar continued its rally on foreign exchanges yesterday, assisted by
an onslaught of verbal intervention from senior US administration officials,
writes Philip Gawith.
Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, again reiterated the virtues of a
stronger dollar, following similar comments earlier from Mr Lloyd Bentsen,
the US treasury secretary.
The markets took cheer from this shift in sentiment, and the dollar closed
in London at DM1.5955 against the D-Mark, well above its Thursday close of
DM1.576, but off the high for the day of DM1.6026.
Against the yen it finished at at Y98.72, down from the high for the day of
Y99.14.
Dealers said some of the dollar's retreat could be attributed to market
disappointment that Mr Greenspan had just repeated what he had said earlier
in the week.
The stronger dollar pushed the D-Mark lower in Europe against most
currencies. Against the lira it finished at L992.6 from L997.5 on Thursday.
Sterling also suffered at the hands of a stronger dollar, finishing at
Dollars 1.528 from Dollars 1.5375. The pound received some assistance from
the UK 2nd quarter GDP estimate of 0.9 per cent growth. This was higher than
the market forecast of 0.8 per cent.
In the absence of statistical releases, the market was left to ponder more
supportive talk for the dollar. After overnight comments from Mr Lloyd
Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, that he believed 'very strongly' in a
strong dollar, Mr Greenspan reiterated his view that a strong currency was
in the national interest.
Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International in London, said a
'180 degree policy reversal' from the administration had now been witnessed.
Until very recently, senior administration officials were explicit in their
opposition to higher rates.
Now Mr Bentsen and his deputy Mr Larry Summers are fulsome about the need
for a stronger dollar. But as Mr Hannah points out, this must mean that are
prepared to accede to the Fed tightening policy further.
Earlier this week Mr Greenspan indicated that a stronger dollar may be
necessary to reverse inflation expectations, and that he would be prepared
to raise rates further to achieve this.
Mr Hannah commented: 'They have given the green light to Mr Greenspan - if
you want to raise rates we will not stand in your way.'
Analysts remain more bullish about the dollar's prospects against the D-Mark
than against the yen. Japan's large current account surplus and US/Japan
trade frictions are seen as underpinning the yen.
German call money rose to 4.85/90 per cent from 4.75/4.85 per cent after the
Bundesbank's decision to set the next four repo tenders at 4.85 per cent,
compared to the current repo rate of 4.88 per cent.
The Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 1.269bn assistance
after forecasting a shortage of Pounds 1.25bn. Overnight money traded
between 3 1/2 and 5 3/4 per cent.
Volumes in the futures market were low with the December eurosterling
contract trading only 11,670 lots to close unchanged at 93.91. The December
euromark contract traded 44,527 lots to finish at 95.01 from 95.09.
