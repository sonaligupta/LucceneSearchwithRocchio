FT  22 OCT 92 / International Company News: Restructuring helps Malbak limit
fall in earnings to 9%

MALBAK, the industrial arm of South Africa's Gencor group, improved on its
forecast earnings per share with 113.5 cents for the year to August. In May,
it foresaw earnings of about 105 cents a share.
However, yesterday's results were 9 per cent lower than the 124.1 cents
achieved a year earlier, though the weighted average of shares in issue in
the latest 12 months was 40 per cent higher than in 1991.
This was the result of a R831m (Dollars 295.70m) rights issue, and a
substantial change in the composition of the group on September 1 1991, when
it acquired Fedfood and SA Druggists and disposed of Darling & Hodgson and
half its stake in Standard Engineering. These transactions refocused the
group on the consumer sector.
Turnover for the restructured group rose by 30 per cent to R11bn from
R8.4bn, while operating profits rose 18 per cent to R851m from R720m.
Attributable profits advanced 28 per cent to R329m from R256m. In spite of
the fall in earnings per share, the dividend is being raised by 3 per cent
to 33.5 cents per share from 32.5 cents.
Mr Grant Thomas, chairman, said the performance was satisfactory given
difficult economic conditions and restructuring and rationalisation
expenses. He forecast maintained earnings for the year ahead, but said
economic conditions 'could well deteriorate further.'
The food division (Foodcorp) contributed 19 per cent to net profits,
packaging and paper (Holdains) 17 per cent and healthcare (SA Druggists) 13
per cent. Operating investments - holdings in Haggie, Standard Engineering
and ICL - contributed 15 per cent to earnings, while 19 per cent came from
rights issue proceeds.
