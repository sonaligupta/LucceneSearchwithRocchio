FT  01 JUL 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market report


   By REUTER


BASE METAL prices settled back from earlier highs in the afternoon on the
LME as the market started to pause for breath after its recent run-up.
Dealers said the extent of the advances since the middle of last week, which
were not based on any solid fundamental factors, made many players nervous.
After further early gains, most prices settled back under profit taking.
Three-month COPPER slipped to the day's lows, matching Comex, and might test
Dollars 2,400 a tonne on the downside. ZINC was under pressure from profit
taking. TIN breached the Dollars 7,000 a tonne level. NICKEL and ALUMINIUM
both touched two-month highs. London's COCOA market also appeared to be
entering a period of consolidation after the recent advance, but dealers
said it could be set to resume its upward trend fairly shortly as there had
been little sign yet of any significant selling by producers into the rally.
Robusta COFFEE extended early losses to finish up to Dollars 21 lower,
depressed by weaker levels in New York amid talk of possible origin selling.
Dealers said they did not expect any major move in coffee prices ahead of
the next meeting of the ICO at the end of the month.
