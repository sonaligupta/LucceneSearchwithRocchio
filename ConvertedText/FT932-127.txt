FT  30 JUN 93 / Observer: On the record


We all knew about the creative side of Lord Healey, the former Labour
chancellor of the exchequer, who takes good photos and tinkles the ivories
when politics gets too boring. But his 44-year-old son has gone one better.
A reggae songwriter and publisher of children books, Tim has just brought
out his first compact disc, The Oxford Ramble, under his own Beautiful Jo
record label. A Balliol man like his dad, Healey junior had been impressed
by the local pub music and raised his own Magpie Lane band to strum the
repertoire. There are plans for other albums too  - The Cotswold Ramble,
Bodleian Ballads.
To promote the initial number, the idea is to persuade Healey pere to come
to Oxford to join in some morris dancing. . . .
