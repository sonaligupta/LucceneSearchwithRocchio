Weston


   By REUTER


   TORONTO


SHARPLY higher profits are reported by George Weston, the Toronto-based food
group, Reuter reports from Toronto. Second-quarter earnings increased from
CDollars 3.8m, or 3 cents a share, to CDollars 18.3m, or 39 cents, on
revenues of CDollars 2.79bn against CDollars 2.69bn.
The 1992 results included special provisions of CDollars 15m, equal to 22
cents a share, for Loblaw Cos' investment in a US subsidiary sold in 1988.
First-quarter earnings of Molson Cos, the diversified Canadian group, fell
to CDollars 36.7m or 62 cents a share from CDollars 38.4m or 66 cents a year
ago on revenues of CDollars 772m, down from CDollars 799m.
The group said the profits fall reflected a lower brewing contribution from
to its reduced stake in Molson Breweries, held 40 per cent by Molson Cos, 40
per cent by Australia's Foster's Brewing Group and 20 per cent by Philip
Morris of the US.
