FT  29 JUN 93 / FT Exporter (9): Skills training gives the edge - Networks
of Aid


   By ARIANE GENNILLARD


THE GERMAN federation of craft industries is one of many organisations
representing the Mittelstand element in German industry, writes Ariane
Gennillard.
Financed by members' subscriptions, it operates 400 training centres
teaching the skills which give many of these enterprises their technological
edge.
The German states have various programmes to encourage innovation and the
development of overseas markets. All the states have technology transfer
offices, such as the Steinbeis foundation in Baden-Wurttemberg, which
promotes research and development for small companies. Most of their
programmes are state-funded but many are financed by selling their services.
North Rhine-Westphalia's economics ministry offers a consultancy programme
for those companies looking for new markets. Companies with a turnover of
less than DM50m receive up to DM665 per day towards a 15-day study of their
requirements.
