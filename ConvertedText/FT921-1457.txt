FT  24 MAR 92 / Survey of Employee Ownership (7): Beyond the boardroom - Tax
Incentives


   By ANDREW JACK


   THE SUCCESS of share ownership schemes in Britain is inextricably


although far from exclusively - linked to the tax system.
The Inland Revenue had recognised three different types of 'approved'
employee share schemes awarded tax advantages since the late 1970s. The jury
is still out on how successful they have been.
Profit-sharing schemes, introduced in 1979, allow a company to allocate free
shares to its employees. The shares are not subject to income tax, although
there may be a capital gains tax liability.
Savings-related share option schemes, created by the 1980 Finance Act, allow
a company to grant options to employees to buy shares using the proceeds of
save-as-you-earn savings contracts.
By contrast to these two all-employee schemes, a third set up under the 1984
Finance Act requires less universal coverage. Discretionary share option
schemes allow a company to grant selected employees options to buy shares.
The latest Inland Revenue statistics, issued in February, for the take-up in
the year to March 1991, show a decline in two of the three schemes. Only
those with savings-related share option schemes (where employees can keep
the interest-free savings allocated for their contribution in place of
buying shares) rose, with an increase of 80,000 to 540,000 people covered.
The number of employees in profit-sharing schemes dropped by 20,000 to
900,000 and the number granted discretionary share options fell by 35,000 to
65,000. This is no doubt partly driven by the recession, which has made
shares less attractive to potential investors and employers less willing to
award incentives.
There was little encouragement to spread employee ownership further in Mr
Norman Lamont's 1992 budget proposals. However, there were two significant
changes in last year's Finance Act, which came into effect at the beginning
of this year: one to encourage executives to promote schemes among their
employees; and the other to allow share option beneficiaries to roll their
shares into PEPs.
In his 1991 budget speech, Mr Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer,
expressed dissatisfaction that most employee share schemes 'have been
directed solely at highly paid company executives'.
To extend benefits beyond the boardroom, he considered using a stick but
ultimately opted for a carrot when the bill was introduced. Directors would
be given extra incentives if they publicised the presence of a scheme for
which all employees were eligible.
Until the amendment, it was a condition that any executive share option
scheme seeking approval by the Inland Revenue had to ensure that the price
payable for share options when exercised should not be less than the share
value when the option was first granted.
Under the new arrangement, which came into effect at the beginning of 1992,
executives were permitted to receive up to a 15 per cent discount on this
initial price provided that an all-employee scheme was in place and
publicised to their staff.
The problem - which caused surprise among many commentators in view of the
rhetoric - is that there is no requirement for employees actually to
participate in such a scheme. In fact, in the most extreme case it could
mean that a company could merely discreetly make employees aware of a scheme
without ever setting one up.
'You don't have to have offered participation but merely communicate its
existence,' says Mr Calvin Jackson, a principal with Coopers & Lybrand
Deloitte. 'You could just put a note in with employees' pay slips that a
scheme exists.'
While employees may have been given little encouragement as a result of the
change, executives have since had much of the attraction of the perk to them
wiped out, too. Tough guidelines issued by the Association of British
Insurers and the National Association of Pension Funds have made it much
more difficult to claim the 15 per cent discount by linking it to tough
performance targets.
Very few executives appeared to have taken full advantage of the discounts,
at least in part as a result of these restrictions. 'Most professional
observers would say the ABI has probably over-cooked it,' says Mr Jackson.
The second key tax change introduced in the 1991 budget was to allow
beneficiaries of an all-employee share options scheme a chance to roll their
shares into a single company PEP within 90 days of exercising their right to
buy them. That removes the need to pay any capital gains tax on the shares.
Again, it is rather early to assess the success of the initiative: the
practice only became effective from the beginning of this year. However, Mr
Jackson says that early indications on the take-up appear to be positive.
The tax system has also had more subtle effects on the popularity of
different employee share schemes. Mr Brian Freeman, managing director of
Stoy Benefits, says that there has been an explosion of interest in
unapproved schemes: those ones which are not approved by the Inland Revenue.
There are no official statistics but Mr Freeman says that, based on
conversations with his counterparts in other consulting firms, he estimates
that 500 or 600 companies now have such schemes.
Before 1988, with a considerable gulf between income tax and capital gains
tax rates, the advantage of approved schemes was clear and unquestionable.
Unapproved schemes were liable to income tax. Approved schemes would be
charged CGT only when any shares were later sold.
Now the rates are so similar that Mr Freeman says: 'People do not care so
much as they used to whether schemes are approved or not.' However, Mr
Jackson says: 'Unapproved schemes have rather more unfriendly tax
regulations. I think I would prefer to be in an approved scheme.'
It is difficult to quantify how many people retain their shares even once
they have exercised an option to buy them in the short-term. Take-up figures
aside, Mr Freeman questions the long-term effectiveness of employee share
schemes. 'I am not sure of the extent to which they engender a real feeling
of wider share ownership,' he says.
