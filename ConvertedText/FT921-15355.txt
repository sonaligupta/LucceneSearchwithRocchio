FT  10 JAN 92 / G-Plan closes factory with the loss of 600 jobs


   By BETHAN HUTTON


SIX HUNDRED jobs are to be cut with the closure of a G-Plan furniture
factory in High Wycombe, Bucks.
The move comes as part of a retreat from cabinet-making by G-Plan's owner
Christie-Tyler, a subsidiary of Hillsdown Holdings which bought G-Plan in
1989.
Negotiations are under way to sell two other G-Plan factories, at King's
Lynn, Norfolk, and Ashford, Kent, to The Cabinet Makers, the Bath-based
group which will manufacture cabinets to be sold under the G-Plan name.
Christie-Tyler announced yesterday that Spring Gardens factory at High
Wycombe will be run down over the next six months.
Mr Richard Willan, managing director of Christie-Tyler, said the
cabinet-making side of the company's operations had been particularly badly
hit by the effect of high interest rates on consumer spending and the
housing market.
He said 30 per cent of furniture sales were related to home moving and were
vulnerable to stagnation in the housing market.
Furniture manufacturing is one of High Wycombe's traditional industries, and
one of the town's three largest sources of employment. Other manufacturers
in the area include Ercol and Parker Knoll. G-Plan is the first factory
closure, but other companies have announced redundancies.
The loss of 600 jobs will hit the local economy hard - unemployment in the
town stood at 11,182 in November, almost treble the figure for October 1990.
The High Wycombe Jobcentre said that very few jobs were being advertised in
other furniture factories.
Mr Richard Cummings, chief executive of Wycombe District Council, said: 'It
is a severe blow to Wycombe, which has always been at the heart of the
country's furniture trade.'
