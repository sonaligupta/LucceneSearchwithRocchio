FT  27 SEP 94 / Foes of secrecy claim a victory


   By JAMES BLITZ


Campaigners seeking to reduce official secrecy in Whitehall yesterday
claimed an important victory after a government department was forced to
release a hitherto confidential document.
A Department of Transport inspector's report into proposals to build the
Birmingham northern relief road was released to the public under the new
code of practice on access to government information introduced earlier this
year.
DoT officials had strenuously resisted demands from a group of MPs to
publish the report, which was drawn up in 1988. However, in his first
adjudication since the code was introduced, the ombudsman, Mr William Reid,
demanded that the report be published, overruling claims by DoT officials
that this would prejudice the current inquiry into a similar scheme.
Mr Maurice Frankel, director of the Campaign for Freedom of Information,
said yesterday that publication of the document was an early sign the
government was taking its obligations to reveal official secrets more
seriously than had been expected.
Under the code, Whitehall departments are not obliged to release primary
documents but can summarise their findings in a letter. 'The fact that the
ombudsman has called for full publication - and that this has been followed
up - is a very positive sign indeed,' Mr Frankel said.
