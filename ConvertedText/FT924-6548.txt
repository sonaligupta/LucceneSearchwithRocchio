FT  20 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Wool output forecast to fall
further in 1992-93


   By DAVID BLACKWELL


WORLD WOOL production, which fell by 10 per cent last season, is expected to
decline further in 1992-93 to the level of the early 1980s as adverse
weather conditions and low prices continue to take their toll, according to
a report from the International Wool Textile Organisation.
Total world availability of wool (production plus carry-over stocks) is
expected to fall to 2.26m tonnes from 2.45m tonnes in 1991-92 and a record
2.46m tonnes in 1990-91. This follows a decade in which availability rose by
43 per cent and marks the 'most significant contraction in supplies since
the early 1970s'.
The report estimates production for the coming season at 1.67m tonnes, down
from 1.74m tonnes in 1991-92 and 14 per cent down on the 1989-90 record of
1.97m tonnes. Carry-over stocks are forecast to decline to 592,000 tonnes
from 719,000 tonnes in 1991-92.
'Leading exporters Australia, New Zealand and Argentina are expected to
account for well over 60 per cent of the current season's contraction and
the former Soviet Union for most of the balance,' the report says.
Australia, the world's biggest producer, is expected to produce 549,000
tonnes, down 4 per cent on the previous year and 21 per cent on 1990-91.
Sheep numbers were down 10 per cent to 151m in the year to the end of March.
By September 25 this year the Australians had reduced their stockpile from
the January 1991 peak of 553,398 tonnes to 472,306 tonnes.
Overall demand for wool is expected to continue to improve as a result of
strong growth in China, Korea and Taiwan and the prospect of recovery in
Western industrialised countries. This will bring supply and demand into
much better balance, the report says.
