FT  07 JAN 94 / Unions in Swan Hunter refit bid


Union officials fighting for the survival of Swan Hunter, the Tyneside
shipbuilder in receivership, yesterday launched a campaign to persuade the
Ministry of Defence to advance a big refit by three months and place the
contract with the yard.
They began distributing postcards - to be sent to the prime minister - among
Swan Hunter's remaining 1,088 employees, to strengthen a call for the MoD to
award Swan Hunter the refit of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary supply vessel Sir
Bedivere.
