FT  13 MAR 93 / Call for EC-wide television strategy


   By ANDREW HILL


   BRUSSELS


The European Community should develop a co-ordinated approach to advanced
television technology, based on wide-screen broadcasts and a 'family' of
digital television transmission standards, the European Commission said
yesterday, reports Andrew Hill from Brussels.
Mr Martin Bangemann, EC industry commissioner, and Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro,
responsible for audiovisual policy, said a common approach to digital
standardisation was the best way to 'reduce the risk of market fragmentation
which a haphazard unco-ordinated approach could bring'.
But industry analysts warned yesterday that the Community risked repeating
the errors of its original ill-fated HDTV strategy. This was based on a
family of analogue standards, and was criticised for being driven by
technology rather than consumer needs.
