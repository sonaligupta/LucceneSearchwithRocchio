FT  03 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Rolls-Royce falls


   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON


Aero-engines and industrial power group Rolls-Royce recorded one of the
day's sharpest falls in percentage terms after it surprised the market with
a rights issue and reported figures just below market forecasts.
Half-time profits came in at Pounds 31m, against estimates of around the
Pounds 35m mark, and were accompanied by an announcement of a one-for-four
rights issue at 130p, to raise Pounds 307m.
Market watchers were unconvinced by the company's reasons for the cash call,
pointing out that it would dilute 'the earnings recovery picture'. One
researcher said: 'They have simply failed to explain the reasons for the
rights issue now. It is opportunistic.' Analysts were also alarmed by the
continued R&D expenditure, leading some to suggest that there may be
problems with the Trent engine programme.
Dealers rushed to sell the shares, which tumbled 11 to 152 1/2 p in heavy
trading of 14m as brokers moved to downgrade full year profits forecasts.
NatWest Securities weighed in with a sharp downgrade, reducing its full year
estimate by Pounds 17m to Pounds 73m, while Charterhouse Tilney moved from
Pounds 85m to Pounds 68m.
London Scottish Bank, the financial services, consumer credit, debt
collection and reinsurance group, attracted a wave of takeover speculation
that drove the shares up to a record 105 1/2 p before closing at 104p,
leaving a net gain of 15. Turnover was a much higher than usual 296,000
shares. Provident Financial, 4 easier at 448p, was one name put forward as a
potential bidder for the group.
There was a further fresh burst of buying interest in the life assurance
sector, where Refuge Group, which holds a 14.9 per cent stake in London
Scottish, rose 13 to 1028p. Britannic added 8 at 478p and United Friendly
extended its recent strong performance to close 30 higher at 688p.
Sun Alliance's poor performance affected other composites, General Accident
weakening 16 to 657p, Commercial Union 10 to 593p and Guardian Royal
Exchange 7 to 210p. Traders reported big two-way trading in Royal Insurance,
2 off at 309p on turnover of 5m.
Renewed switching oper-ations out of HSBC and into Standard Chartered drove
the former down 9 1/2 more to 717p and sustained the latter, which edged up
3 to 941p.
Talk that Next will shortly be expanding into the US, albeit in only a small
number of outlets, depressed the shares. They finished 7 1/2 cheaper at
193p.
Reports of a downgrade by a US broker on Xerox Corp in the US impacted on
Rank Organisation shares, which retreated 22 to 763p.
A deal between Chrysalis and Fujisankei in which the latter will buy a share
in Chrysalis's fledgling record label for Dollars 17.5m sent the stock
surging 37 to 116p.
Suggestions that next month's figures from Lucas Industries will be
accompanied by an enhanced scrip dividend alternative boosted the shares,
which ended 4 ahead at 163p.
