FT  25 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Laporte


Judging by yesterday's results, Laporte has not been quite as successful in
defying recession this time as it was a decade ago. But a 6 per cent fall to
Pounds 97m in pre-tax profits for 1991 was not a bad performance: the figure
would have been flat had it not been for a Pounds 6m hit from the permanent
loss of one customer in its absorbents division. It is nonetheless striking
to recall that 18 months ago the market confidently thought Laporte would be
making Pounds 145m last year. It is just as well the group has insignificant
gearing and that the increased dividend was comfortably covered.
The logic of separating from Solvay was accepted when the break-up of their
Interox joint venture was announced last year. Yesterday's details suggest
both sides achieved their objective, so Laporte was ungracious towards its
partner in suggesting that Interox had become a drag on profits growth. Its
main reason to separate was to concentrate on high-margin specialty
chemicals, a strategy taken a step further by the acquisition of Rockwood, a
US pigments producer.
Investors must take the numbers on trust, but earnings from Rockwood should
more than offset the loss of the full contribution from Interox. All the
same, Laporte needs economic recovery if progress this year is to be
anything more than steady. That outlook is properly reflected by the average
rating of its shares.
