FT  23 JUL 93 / UK Company News: YRM ends year Pounds 1.98m in the red


   By GRAHAM DELLER


SHARES of YRM closed 3p lower at 37p yesterday, having touched 33p earlier
in the day, after the building design consultancy recorded its first-ever
annual loss and passed its final dividend.
When reporting an interim deficit of Pounds 498,000 in February, YRM said it
should be profitable in the second half. In the event it incurred full year
pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.98m, against previous profits of Pounds 1.38m, on
turnover down to Pounds 14.1m (Pounds 19.6m).
Mr Brian Henderson, chairman, attributed the losses for the 12 months to
April 30 to sharply increased expenditure on building services engineering
commissions and provisions against debtors and work in progress. The group
also took provisions of Pounds 700,000 for future property costs and Pounds
75,000 following revaluation of a freehold property.
Moves to reduce operational costs continued with redundancies amounting to
Pounds 358,000, against Pounds 603,000. Mr Henderson said the annualised
saving was Pounds 1.6m.
Although there were signs that the improvement in the UK economy was
stimulating new building investment initiatives - a number of new
commissions had been awarded throughout the group - Mr Henderson said that
trading conditions remained extremely difficult.
After a tax credit, losses per share emerged at 12.58p (earnings of 5.78p).
The omitted final dividend leaves a 0.5p payment for the year; the previous
year saw a total distribution of 4p.
The accounts were prepared on a going concern basis, dependent on an
anticipated agreement for continuing facilities with the group's bankers.
