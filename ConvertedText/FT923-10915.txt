FT  28 JUL 92 / International Company News: Benetton in asset swap with
Edizione


   By HAIG SIMONIAN


   MILAN


BENETTON, the Italian casual wear manufacturer, yesterday confirmed it had
swapped a clutch of clothing assets with Edizione Holding, the Benetton
family's private holding company, in return for a 38 per cent stake in
Prince, the US sports group.
The transaction caused some surprise, as it appears to conflict with the
strategy of large-scale sub-contracting under which Benetton has flourished
since its birth in the mid-1960s.
Benetton is buying majority holdings in four Italian companies for L90bn
(Dollars 80m). It is transferring to Edizione Holding its stake in Prince,
worth around Dollars 70m.
Edizione Holding bought 80 per cent of Prince in September 1990 for an
undisclosed sum, and took a further 15 per cent the following month. The
company did not then reveal that part of the stake was being acquired by
Benetton itself, which is 80 per cent controlled by the Benettons through
Edizione Holding.
