FT  29 JAN 92 / France loosens investor curbs

FRANCE has loosened one of its few remaining curbs on foreign investment,
the latest step in a gradual increase in liberalism which began in the
mid-1980s.
The relaxation is intended to benefit non-European Community businesses,
which will no longer have to seek prior government approval to buy French
companies. This applies to takeovers worth less than FFr50m (Pounds 5.11m)
of French companies with annual sales of less than FFr500m, representing 90
per cent of non-EC acquisitions in France.
From now on, non-EC investors will simply have to notify their plans to the
government, which will have 15 days - as against one month previously - to
veto bids deemed to threaten public order, health or national defence
interests. This puts EC and non-European companies on the same footing.
The move is of symbolic importance, coinciding with the government's
decision to allow IBM, the US computer maker, to buy a stake in Bull, the
state-owned computer group. However, the practical impact will be slight,
since the Finance Ministry held up only four of the 2,250 takeover proposals
presented to it in 1990, the latest year for which figures are available.
Among the blocked or delayed investments were plans by Toyota and Nissan to
take control of their French distributors, later cleared after the signing
of the EC-Japan accord on car imports. In that year, the government vetoed
the proposed takeover by Giancarlo Parretti, the Italian financier, of Pathe
Cinema, the French film theatre.
Underlying the relaxation is official concern over the continuing imbalance
between French investment abroad and foreign investment in France. In the
five years to 1990, French companies invested FFr535m abroad, while foreign
investors brought less than half that amount, FFr263m into France. Paris is
hoping new investors will provide jobs.
