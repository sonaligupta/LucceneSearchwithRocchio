FT  27 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Uncertain workers' rights


   From Mr JOHN HALL


Sir, Your leader, 'Workers' Rights' (September 21), rightly points out that
the principle of security of employment established by the European
Commission's Acquired Rights directive is inappropriate when applied to
short-term contracts for public services.
While the revised directive to which the Commission has agreed goes some way
to solving this problem, the wording is so uncertain that its scope could
only be properly determined after litigation in the European Court.
Companies in the service sector have faced two problems with the directive
over the past two years; the problem of applying it to service contracts,
and legal uncertainty as to whether it applied in the first place. While the
former might ultimately be solved by the Commission's proposal, this would
follow a renewal of uncertainty which could take years to resolve.
Further clarity is required. Fortunately, the revised directive remains to
be agreed by the Council of Ministers. It appears that several member states
are now as concerned as the British government at the impact of the
directive on their programmes of privatisation and contracting out.
Because of this, business interests across Europe must press for their
national governments to demand further changes, clearly excluding service
contracts from the scope of the directive, before it is agreed to by the
Council of Ministers.
