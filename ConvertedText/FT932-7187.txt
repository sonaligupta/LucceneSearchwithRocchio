FT  25 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Unigate buys back dairy and depots


Unigate is to buy Dairy Crest's Marshfield dairy located at Cardiff and four
associated depots for Pounds 11.45m.
The dairy and three depots in south Wales - the other is at Marlborough -
were part of Unigate until 1989 when they were sold to Dairy Crest as part
of a package together with other dairy businesses in the Midlands and
eastern counties.
MD Foods, based in Accrington, said yesterday that it had acquired Dairy
Crest's milk business at Bamber Bridge, near Preston.
No details of the consideration were given. As part of the integration of
the businesses the Accrington dairy, which employs 350 people, will be
closed.
MD said the deal enlarged and consolidated its operations in the north-west
and produced a stronger base for further development.
