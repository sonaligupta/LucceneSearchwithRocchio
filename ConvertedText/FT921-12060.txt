FT  29 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Iraqi supergun fired 'using British
parts' - Trade and Industry Committee


   By NEIL BUCKLEY


A PROTOTYPE Iraqi supergun made with parts supplied by a British company was
test-fired four times, on one occasion launching a projectile a distance of
229km (143 miles), MPs will hear today.
The final firing took place in September 1990, after the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait and only three months before the beginning of the Gulf war.
The disclosure comes in written evidence submitted by Customs and Excise to
the Commons trade and industry committee, taken from a report by the United
Nations team investigating Iraq's weapons programme.
The report says Iraq was developing five superguns. The two biggest had a
calibre of 1,000mm and a barrel length of 151m, while three had a calibre of
350mm and shorter barrels.
One of the smaller guns, with a 52m barrel of steel tubes supplied by Walter
Somers, the Halesowen steel company, was constructed at Jabal Hamryne, north
of Baghdad. It was test-fired four times between June and September 1990, on
the final occasion propelling a 67kg test projectile 229km.
Foreign office officials yesterday told the committee the 'capacity for
deception and scale of deception in Iraq' was a main lesson the government
had learned from the supergun affair. Mr John Goulden, an assistant
under-secretary at the FCO, said the British government had been caught by
surprise by the true extent of Iraq's weapons programme.
