FT  19 APR 94 / UK Company News: Tea boost as Linton grows 38% to Pounds
10.6m


   By DAVID BLACKWELL


Higher tea production and prices in Kenya and Malawi were behind a 38 per
cent rise in 1993 profits at Linton Park, the tea and coffee producer,
importer and exporter that also has interests in Scottish fishing.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 7.66m to Pounds 10.6m on the back of an 11
per cent rise in turnover from Pounds 129m to Pounds 143.5m. The shares rose
22p to 360p.
The latest turnover figure includes Pounds 7.1m from Kakuzi, a long-time
Kenyan associate which became a subsidiary in March 1993.
The company is 60 per cent owned by Lawrie Group, itself owned by Camellia,
the quoted investment company with interests which include fine art and tea
plantations.
Operating profits from continuing operations increased from Pounds 9.06m to
Pounds 11.5m.
Mr Malcolm Perkins, managing director, said last year had seen good demand
for the high quality sun-dried arabica coffee from Kenya, and prices had
improved, partly because of the producer countries' introduction of a quota
system.
Tea profits had also been good in Kenya, reflecting quality improvements,
but not so good in Malawi.
The cold storage, transport and distribution side of Associated Fisheries
had performed well, but the fishing industry itself had had a bad year.
The pre-tax figure included an exceptional gain of Pounds 306,000 on the
disposal of Macfish, compared with Pounds 500,000 last time.
Net interest payable fell from Pounds 1.91m to Pounds 1.14m, reflecting
lower rates.
The tax charge rose from Pounds 1.76m to Pounds 3.1m. However, the 1992
figure included an exceptional UK tax credit of Pounds 886,000.
After minority interests of Pounds 1.94m, compared with a previous Pounds
1.66m, earnings per share increased from 31.8p to 41p.
A final dividend of 12.5p is proposed, bringing the total for the year to
15p (14p).
