FT  22 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Builders buoyed


   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE


Building and construction stocks rose strongly for a second consecutive
session as investors responded to this week's results from Abbey National.
The group reported buoyant house sales in the first quarter and this,
coupled with similarly positive views from some house builders recently, has
boosted the sectors' rating.
Moreover, building analysts believe the rises will be sustained in
construction shares, although most think contractors and materials issues
will struggle to hold present levels. 'Construction stocks have a very
substantial upside,' said Mr Jonathan Timms at Charterhouse Tilney. 'By the
end of next year, we expect the sector, currently standing at 76 to the
All-Share, to be back on a one-for-one rating.'
Mr Howard Procter at Panmure Gordon, who is also bullish on the house
builders, added that the outlook for the contracting and building materials
markets remained dull and that the indiscriminate advance across the sectors
would give way to more selected buying.
Both houses like George Wimpey, up 11 at 169p, with Panmure also tipping
Raine, ahead 7 at 100p, and Persimmon, 10 better at 272p. Among other
risers, John Laing added 17 at 269p, and Taylor Woodrow 10 at 113p in
turnover of 6.6m. The materials sector had Ibstock Johnson up 5 at 61p,
Marley 6 ahead at 132p and Spring Ram, another Charterhouse choice, 4 higher
at 75p.
Strong demand for Williams Holdings followed a meeting at James Capel on
Tuesday evening. The shares jumped 15 before closing 13 up at 334p after
2.8m traded. US selling was blamed for the retreat in Danka Business, which
fell 36 to 590p.
A turnround in results from Helical Bar and an upbeat statement helped the
shares leap 16 to 186p.
Following dismal results on Tuesday, Hammerson continued to decline on the
back of negative comments and fading bid hopes. The stock lost 12 to 289p.
NatWest Securities suggests an asset value of 250p.
The cloud over Hammerson pulled down other leading property stocks. MEPC
retreated 11 to 370p and Land Securities 5 to 525p.
A relief factor was said to be driving Ladbroke Group forward as it emerged
that the company's off-balance sheet debt would be far less than some had
had feared. Ladbroke put the figure at Pounds 80m, well below bearish
suggestions of up to Pounds 250m. NatWest Securities reinforced its view
that the stock had been oversold on the worries and said 'buy'. The shares
rose 5 to 177p, pulling up Forte 5 to 199p.
Standard Chartered climbed 6 to 746p, helped by a recommendation from broker
Hoare Govett based on the benefits of sterling depreciation in 1992 coming
through in 1993.
Tobacco to insurance group BAT Industries dropped 15 to 880p after Philip
Morris reported a 1.1 per cent fall in first-quarter US cigarette sales.
The rise in electricity stocks continued but water shares marked time. Among
the Recs, the smaller stocks shone, with Seeboard ahead 10 at 516p, South
Wales 8 at 548p and Northern 3 at 529p. Scottish generators were said to be
pushed by Goldman Sachs. Scottish Power climbed 4 to 320 1/2 p and Scottish
Hydro-Electric 5 to 342p.
Chemicals group Ellis & Everard rose 12 to 195p following a well received
lunch for institutional investors hosted by Hoare Govett.
In the media sector, United Newspapers was one of the best performers as SG
Warburg continued its re-examination of the area by issuing a buy
recommendation, arguing that at a 15 per cent discount to the sector and
with a near 5 per cent yield it 'provides a potent cocktail of recovery
potential and high income'. The shares rose 7 to 593p.
Mirror Group, recommended by the house on Tuesday, added a further 4 at 142p
on heavy turnover of 11.4m shares. Bid stories have continued to circulate
around the stock, although they have been largely dismissed by analysts.
Thames Television fell 5 to 174p on announcing a Pounds 67.5m loss after
extraordinary costs. The slide was softened by speculation over bid interest
from Pearson, up 2 at 414p.
Among food retailers, second line stocks stole the limelight, taking the
opportunity to catch up with the majors. Iceland Frozen Foods rose 5 to 694p
and Kwik Save 6 to 755p.
Dealers in Smiths Industries brushed aside the decline in interim figures
and were instead encouraged by the increase in the dividend and a positive
analysts' meeting. The shares advanced 17 to 347p.
Glynwed International put on 6 at 298p, with Williams de Broe upgrading
forecasts.
