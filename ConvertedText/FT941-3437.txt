FT  16 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: US economy


Yesterday's US producer price data confirmed the Federal Reserve's view that
America does not have an inflation problem. But industrial production and
capacity utilisation figures show why the bond market thinks it may be about
to get one. By most calculations, the US has closed the output gap which
opened during the recession. With capacity constraints now at their tightest
since 1989, further growth above the long-term trend will probably stir
inflation.
Growth may, however, moderate automatically - last year's fall in the
savings ratio is not sustainable and the recent rise in bond yields will
slow the housing market. But since most consumers will sit tight with
low-cost, fixed-rate mortgages, rising yields are not as effective a brake
as falling yields are a stimulus. And while the Fed's initial increase in
short-term interest rates has had a powerful psychological impact on
markets, its effect on the real economy is small. If the Fed becomes
concerned about the pace of expansion, it will have to push up short rates
more decisively.
That worry will probably keep the bond market on edge over the next few
months. Once the Fed acts, however, longer yields may stabilise and fall if
the threat of rising inflationary expectations recedes. Shares have remained
resilient despite the high anxiety of the bond market. That decoupling may
continue. If the rising output and falling unit wage cost figures are any
guide, there is a strong profits recovery out there for someone.
