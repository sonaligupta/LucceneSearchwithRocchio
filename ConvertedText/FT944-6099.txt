subdued trading volume

Small-lot arbitrage buying supported share prices in low volumes, and the
Nikkei 225 average advanced for the second consecutive day, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The index finished 115.13 ahead at 18,926.49 after a day's low of 18,826.37
and high of 18,928.59. Overseas investors continued to sell large-capital
steels and shipbuilders, while individual investors, who had bought shares
on margin, were also sellers.
Volume remained subdued, at 160m shares against 184m.
The life assurers' half-year results released on Monday revealed that
investments during the first six months to September had remained
conservative, with assets allocated to bonds, and a decline in the ratio of
assets in domestic stocks and foreign securities.
Although the top eight life assurance companies, the leading institutional
investors, saw a 2.4 per cent rise in their combined unrealised gains on
assets, analysts reckoned that their ability sharply to increase high risk
investments remained limited.
The Topix index of all first section stocks added 11.40 at 1,502.82, while
the Nikkei 300 moved ahead 2.48 to 276.64. Rising issues outpaced declines
by 655 to 299, with 210 stocks unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
was just 0.19 firmer at 1,238.06.
Traders said worries over the December 9 futures settlement were declining
as an increasing number of investors were rolling over their positions into
the March contract.
Steel companies were actively traded. Sumitomo Metal Industries, the busiest
issue of the day, dipped Y3 to Y320 on selling by overseas investors, while
Nippon Steel put on Y3 at Y379. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries improved Y3 to
Y729 in spite of selling by foreigners.
Nippon Soda, a chemical company, appreciated Y7 to Y594 in active trading as
individual investors were encouraged by the company's glass which cleans
itself using ultraviolet rays from the sun.
Hoya, a contact lens maker, rose Y90 to Y2,570 on the liquid crystal display
theme, while Nippon Paint, which is developing liquid crystal colour
filters, climbed Y21 to Y700.
Japan Airlines, heavily sold on Monday on fears over its unrealised foreign
exchange losses, regained Y19 at Y700. Sanyo Electric was Y14 higher at Y577
on hopes of strong earnings. Toshiba ended Y8 up at Y691.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 87.51 to 20,898.23 in volume of 7.5m shares.
Nintendo, the video game maker, moved forward Y130 to Y5,400.
