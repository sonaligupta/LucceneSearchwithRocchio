FT  27 MAY 93 / British Coal allowed to close 10 pits


   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent


BRITISH COAL'S plans to sell off 20 mines to the private sector were
advanced yesterday when the High Court ruled the corporation could go ahead
with the shutdown of the first 10 pits in its programme.
Two High Court judges ruled British Coal could legally shut the 10 pits
since the corporation had complied with the court's conditions on
consultation with mining unions. The conditions were imposed last December
when the programme was declared illegal.
Lord Justice Glidewell said British Coal had tried to seek agreement with
the unions on the form of consultation. The independent element of scrutiny
demanded by the court last December had been provided by Boyds, the mining
consultants, who had reported on the economic viability of the 10 pits.
He rejected claims by the National Union of Mineworkers that the
consultations had been neither independent nor impartial. He said the union
had either misunderstood the conditions demanded by the court or attempted
to drag out proceedings in the hope this would benefit its members.
British Coal welcomed the judgment and reasserted its intention to go ahead
with the closures and offer 20 pits to private buyers. 'The fabric of the
mines will be preserved while we assess the prospects for disposal to the
private sector in keeping with our commitment which was reflected in the
recent government white paper,' it said. British Coal has received about 20
approaches from companies interested in bidding for some of the pits.
