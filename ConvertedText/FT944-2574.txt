FT  16 DEC 94 / Councils Shake-up: Mixed views on single-tier structure -
Scotland


   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent


In Scotland, a uniform single-tier local government structure comes into
effect on April 1 1996, following the passage last month of the Scottish
Local Government Reform Act. Elections for the shadow authorities take place
this April.
There will be 28 single-tier councils in mainland Scotland, replacing the
nine regional and 53 district councils. The three single-tier island
councils will be unchanged.
There was no equivalent in Scotland of Sir John Banham's Local Government
Commission to test local opinion. Instead people were asked about government
white paper proposals for the new councils and the water industry.
Opposition parties had envisaged local government being reorganised only
after the establishment of a Scottish parliament or independent state. But
the government could claim that it has simply implemented commitments
contained in the 1992 general election manifestos of the Labour, Liberal
Democrat and Scottish National parties - as well as its own.
Although all Scottish local authorities are now co-operating with the
Scottish Office over reform, there are widespread misgivings about the loss
of the strategic role played by the nine regional councils. For instance,
Strathclyde Regional Council - centred on Glasgow - is being broken into 12
authorities. Yet where an existing district council will become a unitary
authority, local government staff are showing enthusiasm for the extended
powers.
The government is taking water and sewerage out of local authority control
to set up three state-owned water authorities, involving the private sector
in upgrading facilities.
The Scottish Office intends to hand management of motorways and main dual
carriageways to private companies, which may be asked to co-ordinate the
management of other trunk roads.
