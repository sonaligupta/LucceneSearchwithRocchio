FT  08 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Opposition to PO privatisation is not
wilful misrepresentation


   From Mr DAVID ERDMAN


Sir, The editorial, 'Avoiding postal fudge' (November 3), was sufficiently
arrogant and ill-informed to merit comment.
The claim that opposition to postal privatisation is motivated mostly by
ignorance or wilful misrepresentation is the view from an ivory tower.
Actually, the public is afraid of seeing another service damaged in the same
way that health, education and transport have been, by a combination of
increased cost and decreased availability.
As regards misrepresentation, the government's case has certainly been well
aired, not least by your newspaper, but the views against privatisation have
hardly been reported at all.
More than half of all main post offices have already been quietly privatised
through franchising to retail outlets. In the process many people have lost
the benefits deriving from continuous employment. Their pension and pay has
been reduced. It is not at all clear that the European Union's Acquired
Rights Directive - known as TUPE, and which protects the terms and
conditions of public-sector employees whose contracts are transferred to the
private sector - have been observed in the process.
The closure of post offices in town high streets has had a detrimental
effect on the viability of remaining shops in much the same way that opening
superstores has.
Many post offices have been sited in superstores and other outlets not
easily accessible to pensioners. The advice offered to them has been to open
bank accounts, which some can neither afford nor understand.
The process of franchising is continuing today despite the resounding vote
of no confidence given to privatisation by the public through their elected
representatives.
