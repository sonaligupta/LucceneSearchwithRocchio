FT  23 APR 93 / International Company News: Rise of 21% in per share
earnings at Citic Pacific


   By SIMON HOLBERTON


   HONG KONG


CITIC Pacific, the Beijing-controlled conglomerate in Hong Kong, yesterday
posted a 200 per cent rise in net profits to HKDollars 1bn (USDollars 129m)
from HKDollars 332.9m in 1991 on turnover of HKDollars 8.3bn, up from
HKDollars 118m.
The directors declared a final dividend of 22 cents a share making 30.2
cents for the year - up 25 per cent on 1991.
Comparisons with the past are difficult because Citic underwent a large
change in 1992, acquiring Hang Chong, a large trading company. The figures
also include a first time contribution from Citic's 12.5 per cent interest
in Cathay Pacific and 46 per cent of Dragon Air.
During the year Citic also acquired a 12 per cent stake in Hongkong Telecom,
interests in two mainland Chinese power stations and a share in a waste
disposal plant in Hong Kong.
Earnings per share - a better guide to Citic's management of its assets -
grew by 21 per cent to 87.4 cents, from 72 cents in 1991.
Mr Larry Yung, chairman, said Citic would continue to acquire more assets
and raise more cash but only as long as two pre-conditions were met - 'that
per share earnings will not be diluted and that the interests of small
shareholders will be protected.'
Da Chong Hong, which distributes Nissan cars, moved aggressively into
mainland China last year. Citic said that sales to China, which analysts put
at more than 12,000, accounted for 54 per cent of its total car sales last
year.
Da Chong Hong also plans to manage a confectionery and food manufacturing
plant in Shanghai and has signed an agreement with Isuzu of Japan to produce
trucks and vans in Sichuan.
Profits from Dragon Air - the Cathay/Citic joint venture airline which took
over Cathay's China routes - doubled last year. Jardine Fleming estimated
that Dragon produced a profit of more than HKDollars 200m.
