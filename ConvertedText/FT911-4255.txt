FT  20 APR 91 / UK Company News: Hammerson assets decline by 22%


   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent


THE SHARP fall in property values across the world, combined with currency
fluctuations, resulted in a 22 per cent drop in the asset value of
Hammerson, the UK's third largest property company, in 1990.
Mr Sydney Mason, who has been chairman since 1958, told shareholders: 'On
balance, I regard 1990 and potentially 1991 as two of the most difficult
years your company will have had to face.'
In previous property downturns in the UK, Hammerson has been shielded by its
high proportion of overseas assets. However, Mr Masom said the global
recession had taken its effect in the majority of markets in which the
company operated. 'The exception has been continental Europe, particularly
France, Germany and Spain, where markets have remained more active', he
said.
Pre-tax profits for the 12 months fell by 6.1 per cent, from Pounds 75.3m to
Pounds 70.7m. However, after allowing for adverse exchange movements and the
effects of refinancing two outstanding Canadian dollar preference share
issues, underlying operating profits would have been Pounds 64.6m - an
increase of Pounds 3.9m, or 6.4 per cent.
UK net rental income rose by over 19 per cent to Pounds 46.5m. At constant
exchange rates the increase in net rental income from overseas operations
was 11 per cent.
Net assets per share fell by 236p to 832p, of which 91p was accounted for by
the strengthening of sterling during the year. The investment portfolio
dropped in value by 11 per cent, following its revaluation.
Mr Mason said the company was well placed to take advantage of any buying
opportunities provided by a depressed market, where improvement appeared
unlikely before 1992. 'Uncertainty remains over the outlook for property
markets worldwide, but in the longer term I believe these markets will
improve', he said.
There was an extraordinary loss of Pounds 11.4m (gain Pounds 18.4m) relating
to a fall in value of some housing land in Connecticut.
That followed a change in the group's accounting policy on valuations.
Whereas in the past all shortfalls in valuation against cost were included
in the profit and loss account as extraordinary items, such items will now
include only those short falls which the board deems to be permanent. The
shortfalls that are deemed temporary will be reflected in the revaluation
reserve.
Earnings per share rose by 2.3 per cent from 30.3p to 31p. A final dividend
of 17p makes a 20.5p (19.5p) total.
