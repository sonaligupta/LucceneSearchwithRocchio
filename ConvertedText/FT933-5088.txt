FT  06 SEP 93 / Strikes paralyse Malawi


   By NICHOLAS YOUNG


   LILONGWE


A WAVE of public sector strikes has brought ministries, hospitals and
airports to a standstill in Malawi. Post office and telecommunications
workers are threatening to join the dispute this week, writes Nicholas Young
in Lilongwe.
Civil servants demanding wage rises of more than 100 per cent have been on
strike since Thursday, and Lilongwe airport remains closed after action by
traffic controllers.
The government claims to have a settlement with health workers, but clinical
officers at Blantyre's Queen Elizabeth Hospital say they are treating only
emergency cases, and hospital administrators are in dispute with management.
Popular expectations have been raised by the result of the referendum in
June on Malawi's constitutional future. A majority voted in favour of a
multi-party system of government. President Hastings Banda's Malawi Congress
party, power for 28 years, is negotiating with opposition groups a general
election timetable.
