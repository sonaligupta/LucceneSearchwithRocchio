FT  27 JUL 92 / Mother of Battles


   By REUTER


President Saddam Hussein urged Iraqis yesterday to hold high the banners of
the Mother of Battles - his term for the war over Kuwait, Reuter reports.
Speaking before the latest UN confrontation was settled, he said Iraqis had
to continue to mobilise because their enemies still wanted war. But in
Baghdad there has been little sign of the kind of preparations seen before
the Gulf war last year.
