FT  06 JUN 92 / BR axes Grimsby InterCity service


   By RICHARD TOMKINS


FEARS THAT the privatisation of British Rail might lead to service cuts were
reinforced by the announcement yesterday that south Humberside was to lose
its InterCity link with London from October, Richard Tomkins writes.
The service was one of 15 listed as vulnerable in a BR memorandum leaked to
Mr John Prescott, the shadow transport secretary, earlier this year. The
service to be cut is the daily InterCity train from Cleethorpes, Grimsby,
Lincoln and Newark to London.
BR said the decision had been taken for commercial reasons.
