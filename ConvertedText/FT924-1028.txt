FT  21 DEC 92 / Argentina sees steady growth

ENTINA should settle down to sustained, investment-led growth with
reasonably low inflation and improving external accounts in 1993, economy
minister Domingo Cavallo said at the weekend, John Barham reports from
Buenos Aires.
Mr Cavallo told the Financial Times: 'In 1993 we expect economic growth to
continue at a rate of 6-7 per cent, driven by supply-side improvements
through investments and productivity gains.'
He said growth of 8.5 per cent in 1991 and 9 per cent this year was led by a
consumer spending spree that was now giving way to more sustainable
expansion.
He forecast a marked 40 per cent increase in investment that should bring
the investment rate to 21-22 per cent of GDP, 'more than enough to justify
his growth targets'.
