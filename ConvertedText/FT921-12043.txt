FT  29 JAN 92 / Letter: A taxing type of conundrum


   From Mr ALAN GREENE


Sir, Reading Lex ('UK tax', January 25) leaves me asking this question. Why
is a part of British industry moaning about the lack of capital allowances,
which would reduce its taxable profits, while another part is saying that
its taxable profits are too low, resulting in unrelieved advance corporation
tax (ACT)?
Never mind the voters' lack of interest in the niceties of corporation tax,
the chancellor, too, must be rather bored by the topic. Maybe if one of the
leading protagonists in the anti-ACT lobby had not got rid of its UK paper
and retail earnings and if others had not over-distributed to save their
skins, sympathy might be extended.
