FT  25 MAR 92 / Observer: Crown of willow


Now that Albania has thrown out the communists, it might contemplate
restoring the monarchy. As the Balkan nation once offered the throne to
cricketer and all-round athlete, C B Fry, Albania might contemplate giving
the crown to one of England's current cricket team fighting for the World
Cup this morning.
But which cricketer should they choose? King Gladstone (Small) has a certain
ring, which cannot be said of King Derek (Pringle) or King Chris (Lewis).
Surely the ideal candidate is one close to retirement who has the drive and
personality to unite the Albanian people? Long live King Ian Botham.
