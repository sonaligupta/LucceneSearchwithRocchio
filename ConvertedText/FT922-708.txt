FT  26 JUN 92 / Arts: Today's Television


   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY


Do you like riots? Drunken teenagers? Men who spit a lot? The 'professional'
foul? Nil-nil draws? People who say 'The lads done it when it counted, out
there on the park they come good' ? Then soccer is the game for you (if
'game' is the right word) and tonight you have a real treat: the European
Football Championship Final between Germany and Denmark is on live and in
full on both BBC1 and ITV, (7.00). So you can flick backwards and forwards
comparing the vivid prose of John Motson and Trevor Brooking (BBC1) with the
dynamic commentary of Ron Atkinson and Brian Moore (ITV). Lucky you.
The rest of us can pop out for dinner or catch up with Wimbledon (from noon
till 8.00 on BBC2, with an hour of highlights on BBC1 at 10.30) or, if true
TV addicts, pick our way through the BBC2 and C4 schedules. The Crescent And
The Star (8.00 BBC2) is the first of a documentary series on the emergence
of Islam in the former Soviet states of central Asia. Garden Club (9.30 C4)
visits Oxford and BBC2 shows the last in the present series of Have I Got
News For You (10.00), one of the funniest programmes on television.
