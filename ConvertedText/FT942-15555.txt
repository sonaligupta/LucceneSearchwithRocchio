FT  14 APR 94 / International Company News: Accor expects return to profits
growth

Accor, the French travel company which earlier this week announced a fall in
profits for 1993, expects this year to return to profits growth, according
to Mr Paul Dubrule and Mr Gerard Pelisson, joint chairmen.
They said they hoped Accor would, in 1994, see net profits return to the
1992 level of around FFr802m (Dollars 136.6m) against 1993's FFr615m. They
also anticipated faster profits growth, to around FFr1bn, for the following
year.
Accor, which suffered last year from the effects of recession on its
European hotel business, is now waiting to hear whether its offer for
Meridien, the luxury hotel chain controlled by Air France, has been
accepted.
Air France has invited offers for its 57 per cent majority stake in
Meridien. Accor, still burdened by debt after its 1991 takeover of
Wagons-Lits, the Belgian travel group, is mounting a joint bid with Price Al
Waleed, a nephew of King Fahd of Saudi Arabia.
Accor, which hopes to merge Meridien with its Sofitel luxury hotels, will
provide 51 per cent of the cash required for the bid. The prince, whose
fortune is estimated at Dollars 10bn, will provide the rest.
However, their offer faces stiff competition from Forte, the UK hotel group
which has also bid for Meridien.
