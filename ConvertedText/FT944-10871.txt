FT  09 NOV 94 / TV 'people-meters' attacked

Japan's leading commercial networks yesterday hit at Nielsen Japan, the
Japanese arm of the US marketing group, over its launch this month of an
automated system measuring television ratings.
The television networks, stakeholders in Video Research, a ratings research
company which holds a virtual monopoly of the business, said Nielsen's
decision to offer the ratings service was 'regrettable'.
Video Research measures ratings per household, rather than individuals as in
the US and European countries. The data is supplemented by diaries kept by
individual viewers one week in a month.
The networks had previously warned that Nielsen's move would cause
'confusion' in the television advertising business. They had not wanted
Nielsen to start its service until all four parties involved in the ratings
business (advertisers, advertising agencies, networks and ratings companies)
had all agreed to the launch.
Nielsen's move to go ahead despite networks' strong opposition has
frustrated network officials. 'We really weren't expecting this,' said Mr
Yasuharu Urushido of Nippon Television Network. Corporate advertisers and
foreign advertising agencies, which have been calling for individual ratings
for over a decade, have backed Nielsen's decision. They want more detailed
data on the age and sex of viewers.
As a compromise, Nielsen and corporate advertisers had agreed to use data
from the 'people meter' system solely as 'marketing data' and not as a basis
for negotiating advertising rates with the networks. The company offered to
provide the networks with the data free for the first five months.
The networks describe the 'people meter' system as imperfect and the data
inaccurate. Nippon Television and Tokyo Broadcasting Service said they had
rejected Nielsen's offer of free data.
