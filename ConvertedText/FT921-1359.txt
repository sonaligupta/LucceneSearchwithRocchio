   HONG KONG


B+B ASIA, the Hong Kong subsidiary of the Frankfurt-based construction
company Bilfinger und Berger Bau, is to acquire Beazer Australia from
Beazer, the UK building group, for ADollars 34.5m (USDollars 26.3), Reuter
reports from Hong Kong.
B+B Asia agreed on March 20 to take all the shares of the Australian company
currently held by Beazer. Beazer Australia is a holding company with
interests in construction and land and property development.
Bilfinger und Berger will lend B+B Asia HKDollars 165m (USDollars 22.1m) for
the acquisition, and the rest will be borrowed externally.
B+B Asia said it expected strong cash-flow in Australia to allow the loan to
be paid off by the end of June. Payment would be made in the form of a
non-interest-bearing loan to Beazer Australia to replace existing bank debt.
The acquisition is expected to be completed by April 10.
