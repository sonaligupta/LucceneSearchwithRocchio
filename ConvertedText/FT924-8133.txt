   By JULIAN OZANNE


THE Egyptian government is putting all mosques under the direct control of
the Ministry of Religious Affairs in an attempt to combat the influence of
Islamic militants, a semi-official newspaper said yesterday, agencies report
from Cairo.
Al-Ahram said the announcement was made by Mr Mohammed Mahjoub, minister of
religious affairs, to a meeting of officials, preachers and scholars. It
said Mr Mahjoub declared that 'the mosques of Egypt will never be a place
for extremism, terrorism, perverted thoughts or a stronghold of fear and
imported ideas, but will always preserve their proper role in the lives of
Moslems'.
