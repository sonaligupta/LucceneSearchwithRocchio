FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Devanha for market via reverse takeover


   By BETHAN HUTTON


Devanha, the cable television company, is coming to market by reversing into
Worth Investment Trust, which has made a Pounds 24m recommended bid for the
company.
The offer takes the form of 24.628468 new shares in Worth, with one warrant
for every five shares, for each Devanha ordinary share. The Pounds 24m
valuation is based on the 20.5p asset value of existing Worth shares, with a
2p premium. Worth shares were suspended yesterday at 24p.
The new shares will represent 79 per cent of the share capital of the
enlarged company, to be named Caledonian Media Communications.
Marshall Securities is to place 20.5m of the new shares, 17.5 per cent of
the total. Directors and shareholders in Devanha have given irrevocable
undertakings to accept the offer in respect of 90.8 per cent of the shares.
The proposals will be put to an extraordinary meeting on January 9. Dealings
in the new shares and warrants are due to start on January 10.
