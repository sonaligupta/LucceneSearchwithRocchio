FT  22 OCT 92 / Recession in construction industry deepens


THE recession in the construction industry deepened over the summer,
according to figures published yesterday showing a further fall in orders.
According to the Environment Department, UK construction orders fell by 10
per cent during the three months to the end of August, compared with last
year.
A separate survey by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors of almost
150 estate agents in England and Wales, said that the housing market
remained in a deep slump.
The only comfort was a slight increase in interest from first-time buyers.
Two thirds of agents reported a fall in house prices during the quarter to
the end of September. Less than 1 per cent said prices had risen.
According to the Environment Department, orders for private housing fell by
14 per cent compared with June, July and August last year. Private
commercial orders were a quarter lower and private industrial orders were 8
per cent lower.
The National Council of Building Material Producers warned yesterday that
its latest state of trade survey, due to be published on Friday, would
confirm 'the current appalling state of the construction industry.
'There are ominous signs that the industry is now facing a deeper recession
and that the situation is very much worse than had been anticipated.'
