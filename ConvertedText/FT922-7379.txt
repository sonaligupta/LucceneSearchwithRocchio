FT  19 MAY 92 / International Company News: Mannesmann profits fall further


   By ANDREW FISHER

MANNESMANN, the German engineering, motor components and steel tubes group,
suffered a further fall in profits in the first quarter of 1992, mainly as a
result of high start-up costs for its mobile telephone operation.
It gave no profit figure for the period, which saw turnover rise by 25 per
cent to DM6.1bn (Dollars 3.7bn) and new orders by 36 per cent to DM8.1bn.
Foreign business, including exports and sales by subsidiaries abroad, was 18
per cent up at DM3.3bn.
The company said profits in its machinery and industrial plant divisions
were also burdened by the weakness of the economy and increasing pressure on
prices for standard products. The steel tube business was stable, however.
The Brazilian subsidiary showed an improvement after last year's losses,
while motor components - including VDO and Boge for the first time -
performed more favourably.
Last year, the group's net profits fell 43 per cent to DM263m. Mr Werner
Dieter, the chief executive, has said he is 'not pessimistic' about this
year, despite the shaky start. Mannesmann's new D2 cellular telephones
business is due to start this summer.
