FT  13 NOV 93 / UK Company News: BVCA issues disclosure guidelines


   By RICHARD GOURLAY


THE BRITISH Venture Capital Association has issued revised guidelines for
the valuation and disclosure of venture capital portfolios.
The new guidelines are designed to make it more difficult to overvalue
unlisted investments and to encourage greater disclosure.
Mr Iain Tulloch, chairman of the BVCA valuation committee, said application
of the guidelines 'is vital if confidence in venture capital is to grow and
meaningful statistics on the industry are to be produced.'
Valuation of venture capital vehicles has often been highly judgmental,
leading sometimes to one investment being ascribed widely different values
by two investing partners' accounts. In some cases, venture capitalists have
left an investment in their books at an unchanged valuation after it hit
trouble, because in their view the businesses would recover.
The new guidelines, therefore, call for provisions to be made when there has
been a 'diminution in value' - the wording 'permanent diminution' was
previously used.
The BVCA says the adopted principles and procedures should be disclosed. The
venture capitalist is also required to give more information from the annual
accounts of the largest holdings.
They will also have to compare the aggregate of all realisations, including
receiverships, with the aggregate valuation in the investor's last accounts.
