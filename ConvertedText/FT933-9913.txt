FT  06 AUG 93 / International Company News: Weak demand hits Nippondenso

NIPPONDENSO, the component-making affiliate of Toyota, the Japanese vehicle
group, suffered a 10.4 per cent fall in first-half profits to Y27.27bn
(Dollars 257.3m) before tax, as Japanese demand remained weak and margins
were kept under pressure.
Parent company sales were down 4.1 per cent to Y654.2bn. All product groups
were affected, although electronic parts and control equipment held up best.
In Japan, Nippondenso, which has operations in several other countries,
sells primarily to Toyota, which owns 23.5 per cent of the company.
However, in recent years Nippondenso, the biggest company in the sector, has
widened its customer range to include all domestic carmakers except Nissan -
and even there has established an indirect tie-up.
Operating profits were down 8.2 per cent at Y20.74bn, and the company, which
has large cash deposits, said a fall of some Y1.8bn in other income
reflected lower interest rates.
From net earnings per share of Y15.70, against Y21.28, it is paying an
unchanged interim dividend of Y7.
For the full year to December, the company projected pre-tax profits down
19.3 per cent to Y53bn on sales 4.2 per cent lower at Y1,300bn.
Yokohama Rubber, Japan's second-largest tyremaker, saw pre-tax profits fall
29.7 per cent in the half-year to June to Y3.63bn, on sales down 7.9 per
cent to Y127.2bn.
It blamed the impact on exports of the stronger yen, as well as the drop in
car production.
The company projected full-year profits down 16 per cent to Y10bn before
tax, on a 5.9 per cent drop in revenues to Y270bn. It is maintaining an
interim dividend of Y3.50, but said it had yet to decide on the final
payout, previously Y4.50.
