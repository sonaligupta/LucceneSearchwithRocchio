FT  25 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Molynx


The warning in July by Mr Eric Walters, chairman of Molynx Holdings, of the
likelihood of minimal profits for the first six months of 1992 was borne out
yesterday.
At the pre-tax level, profits for the closed circuit television and
environmental control group fell from Pounds 1.1m to just Pounds 45,000.
Interim sales improved by 5 per cent to Pounds 11.1m helped by the
acquisitions of AAM and ISC late in 1991. Excluding the purchases, sales
were down 16 per cent.
Earnings amounted to 0.2p (6.4p) but the interim dividend is a same-again
1.3p.
