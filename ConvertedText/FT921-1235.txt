FT  25 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: BankAmerica merger with
SecPac approved by Fed


   By MARTIN DICKSON and REUTER


BANKAMERICA and Security Pacific have been given a green light by the US
Federal Reserve Bank to complete their Dollars 4bn merger - the biggest
takeover in US banking history - which was first announced last summer.
The two banks, both based on the west coast, said they expected to be able
to complete the deal after a mandatory 30-day waiting period. The process of
combining the banks is expected to take about a year.
The deal will create the second biggest banking group in the US, with assets
of nearly Dollars 192bn, placing it not far behind New York-based Citicorp,
with assets of Dollars 215bn.
The two banks have agreed to sell more than 200 branches to meet anti-trust
concerns.
NationsBank's loan loss provision goal for 1992 stands at Dollars 750m to
Dollars 900m, sharply down from 1991 levels, said Mr Fred Figge, chairman of
credit policy said, Reuter reports. The provision was Dollars 1.6bn in 1991.
