FT  20 APR 94 / Observer: Style wars


The world of advertising can breathe more easily; the sensitive souls of the
Advertising Standards Authority can sleep more easily in their beds at
night; and the feature writers of the world's press will have to turn
elsewhere for whacky Italian copy.
For photographer Oliviero Toscani, 53, says he has resigned from Benetton,
going in a huff after clashing with Aldo Palmeri, managing director of
Benetton's unusual magazine Colors.
Toscani was behind Benetton's controversial advertising campaigns which
featured such things as human genitals and a dying AIDS patient. Apparently
he's fed up because 'like all accountants (Palmeri) knows nothing of
creative work. He has stuck me with a small-time publisher that can't even
get the office toilets to work'.
The feeling is mutual it seems. Says Palmeri: 'To understand business
management, you need an education, you need to read books, but Toscani's
cultural level is simply sub-human.' Boys, boys - it's only advertising,
after all.
