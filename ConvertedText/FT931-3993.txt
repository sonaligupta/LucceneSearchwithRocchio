FT  12 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: IPE may launch natural gas
contract


   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES


THE INTERNATIONAL Petroleum Exchange has set up a task force to consider the
introduction of a natural gas futures contract as the UK opens up its gas
market.
'I can see that natural gas could be an important contract for us when
Europe gets to the point of trading it freely,' said Mr Peter Wildblood,
chief executive of the exchange.
But gas futures trading is unlikely to become a reality for another five
years given the absence of an underlying market - gas is now bought and sold
on the basis of producer contracts.
The New York Mercantile Exchange developed the first market for natural gas
derivatives trading three years ago on the back of de-regulation in the US
gas industry.
The IPE and Nymex are discussing co-operation in several areas including the
establishment of a cross-margining link between the two markets. 'The
exchanges are inter-dependent and we are looking at areas for co-operation
which would benefit the market as a whole,' said Mr Wildblood.
IPE trading volume has increased by 41 per cent so far this year. Last
year's volume reached 35,000 contracts.
