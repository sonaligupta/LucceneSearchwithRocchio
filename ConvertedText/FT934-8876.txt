FT  13 NOV 93 / Five abstain from ban on N-waste


   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor


A COMPLETE ban on dumping radioactive waste at sea was voted for by 37
countries yesterday. Five further countries, including the UK, abstained
from the vote, but they have 100 days to consider their position.
The vote extends the 1972 London Convention on dumping at sea, which already
bans high and intermediate level radioactive waste, to include an indefinite
ban on low level waste.
The vote was taken at the end of a week-long meeting held at the London
headquarters of the United Nations International Maritime Organisation.
Apart from the UK, the abstainers were France, Belgium, China and Russia.
The UK said scientific research showed controlled disposal of low and
intermediate radioactive waste at sea might in certain cases be the best
practicable option, and had negligible impact on the environment. However it
stressed it had no immediate plans to dispose of radioactive waste at sea.
Russia recently admitted dumping radioactive waste and spent nuclear
reactors in the Sea of Japan and the Arctic, provoking an angry response
from Japan, South Korea and the US. It said this week it would be prepared
to halt dumping at sea if it received foreign assistance.
