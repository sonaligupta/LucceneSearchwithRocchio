FT  01 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: CFTC to take tough stance on
fraud


   By LAURIE MORSE


   CHICAGO


The Commodity Futures Trading Commission will insist all US futures
exchanges prove within the next 45 days that they can meet fraud detection
guidelines. It will also press ahead with plans to comply with more
stringent trade-tracking requirements by an October 1995 deadline set by
Congress.
In a report to Congress released on Tuesday, the agency, which regulates US
futures exchanges, took a tough stand. It said that while a number of
exchanges, including the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, claimed they could meet existing trade-tracking rules, CFTC
inspections showed that they fell short of requirements.
Evidence of trading abuses in Chicago trading pits uncovered by a Federal
criminal investigation in 1989 prompted Congress to require better trade
auditing procedures. This year, exchanges must be able to track trades
within one minute of execution with 90 per cent accuracy.
Although the Chicago exchanges have upgraded trade-tracking procedures since
1989, most of their efforts at audit trail improvements have focused on
developing an expensive high-tech trading card which they say is still four
years from being operational.
Mrs Mary Schapiro, who chairs the CFTC, told Congress her agency would not
tolerate the delay, and would require exchanges to use alternative
procedures to upgrade audit trail standards to 1995 levels while developing
the electronic trading card.
