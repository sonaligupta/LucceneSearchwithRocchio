FT  26 JUN 92 / International Company News: Malbak lowers earnings forecast
by 10 per cent

A FURTHER weakening of the South African economy, already in recession for
three years, has caused Malbak, the industrial holding company in the Gencor
group, to lower its earnings forecast for the year to August.
When its interim figures were published in April, Malbak said it was on
track to achieve its target earnings of 117 cents per share. Now, however,
the company says it expects earnings to be about 10 per cent lower, at 105
cents a share.
The announcement confirms the view of analysts that companies with year-ends
this summer are likely to produce worse results than the market has been
anticipating.
Mr Grant Thomas, executive chairman, said the earnings forecast was the
result of a marked deterioration in business conditions with no likelihood
of improvement before the financial year-end.
Malbak has a strong consumer orientation with large interests in packaging
and paper, food and pharmaceuticals. In the six months to the end of
February, the group lifted attributable earnings by 29 per cent to R152m
(Dollars 54.20m) on a turnover of R5.3bn.
