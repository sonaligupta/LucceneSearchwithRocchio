FT  05 MAR 94 / French face action over fish export ban


   By NANCY DUNNE


   WASHINGTON


The US is expected to act swiftly in ordering inspection system delays of
French exports in a tit-for-tat trade dispute over US fresh fish exports. US
fisheries say that since February 5, France has blocked fish, shipped in by
air, by instituting a cumbersome inspection and testing regime and other
paperwork requirements.
Exporters have sought to get around the blockade at French airports by air
freighting their products to other European destinations and trucking it
into France. However, they have been warned that this fish too will now be
seized for inspection.
A spokesman for the National Fisheries Institute said trade officials have
promised decisive action quickly under an emergency provision of US trade
law. They said the retaliation is likely to mirror the French actions, with
increased inspections of French products like wine and cheese. The option of
levying import duties remains viable.
The US has drawn up a list of products for retaliation. A decision by Mr
Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, and President Clinton is said to
be imminent.
