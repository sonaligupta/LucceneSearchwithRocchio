FT  25 MAR 92 / Complaints against insurers rise steeply


   By JOHN AUTHERS


THE NUMBER of dramas that insurance companies made out of crises increased
by 64 per cent last year, judging by the complaints heard by the insurance
ombudsman, Dr Julian Farrand.
His report, published yesterday, said that the 4,334 cases dealt with by his
watchdog bureau were just 'the tip of the iceberg'. There were 13,899
written inquiries and 26,048 telephone queries. Dr Farrand predicts that
around 5,000 cases will be handled this year.
He said the rise had been caused by the recession, which gave consumers more
incentive to complain, and the impact of the Financial Services Act, which
has tightened regulation.
Complainants were successful in only 32 per cent of cases, but the money
awarded as a result totalled Pounds 5m.
In the biggest award, of Pounds 500,000, an insurance company queried
whether its policyholder, a woman reported dead while on a visit to Kenya,
had indeed died. After sending a private detective to Africa it was
discovered that she was dead, but the company then claimed that she could
not have been of sufficient means to justify covering her life for such a
large sum.
The ombudsman pointed out that no question had been asked about her means
when she took out the policy, and called for the company to pay the full
Pounds 500,000 insured.
This case was exceptional, but the ombudsman also handled cases in which
independent intermediaries had forged surrender forms, and where salesmen
had sold wholly inappropriate policies because their training had not
covered more relevant products.
