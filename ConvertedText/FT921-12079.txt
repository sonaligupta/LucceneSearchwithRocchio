FT  29 JAN 92 / Arab investment warning


   By REUTER


   ABU DHABI


A LEADING Gulf business figure yesterday told other Arabs hoping for
handouts from Gulf countries that investing in their economies was a waste
of money, Reuter reports from Abu Dhabi.
Mr Haj Abdullah al-Mohairbi, chairman of the Abu Dhabi Chamber of Commerce
and Industry, said: 'With the exception of the Gulf monarchies, the rest of
the Arab world is bad for both short- and long-term investment.'
Political instability 'discourages potential investors from throwing their
money into these troubled regions.'
Similar views are increasingly heard in private conversations but few have
expressed them so openly.
'Name one Arab country that enjoys full security and stability and both the
public and private sectors in the Gulf states would not hesitate to invest
their money and resources in it,' said Mr Mohairbi, who is also the deputy
speaker of the United Arab Emirates Consultative Council.
'Following the invasion of Kuwait. . .Gulf states became convinced that
prospects for investing in non-oil-producing Arab countries did not exist.'
