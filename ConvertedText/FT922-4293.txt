FT  06 JUN 92 / Clearer's clerical staff reject pay offer


   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff


CLERICAL staff have voted to reject the Royal Bank of Scotland's pay offer
of between 2.5 per cent and 3.5 per cent. Turnout for the ballot was 35 per
cent.
Managerial staff at the bank have accepted a modified performance-related
offer in a separate ballot. Bifu, the banking union, said it was satisfied
that the bank had addressed fears that the offer failed to guarantee an
annual rise for more than 4,000 managerial staff. The union will consider
the position of the 12,000 clerical staff at a meeting in Glasgow next
Thursday.
It originally asked for an 8 per cent increase on all salaries, with a
minimum of Pounds 600. It is understood that the bank is unlikely to improve
its offer.
Meanwhile, an existing dispute continues at the bank over whether staff are
entitled to withdraw from overtime they normally work. Staff have banned
overtime and are working to contract.
