FT  12 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: GrandMet firm


   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON


Talk of sluggish demand and fierce competition continued to drag on the
drinks sector, with investors shunning domestic stocks and turning to Grand
Metropolitan, where analysts have returned from recent meetings with an
upbeat message. The US vegetable business has begun to recover, and with
half its profits earned in dollars the group is also a big beneficiary of
recent currency movements. Analysts also pointed out Grand Met's low
exposure to the weak Scotch market and the upturn in its own drinks
business. The shares added 8 to 479p in turnover of 3.9m.
Bass continued to suffer a hangover from the recent spate of downgrades and
the shares slipped 8 to 575p, dragging with it Whitbread 'A', off 4 at 477p.
Turnover in BTR soared to 10m after the company cheered the market with 1992
results that topped the Pounds 1bn mark for the first time. Profits at the
international conglomerate improved by 18 per cent to Pounds 1.085bn and
investors are to receive a higher than anticipated final dividend.
The shares jumped 25 to 612p as brokers moved to upgrade current year profit
estimates. The range of predictions for this year's profits is between
Pounds 1.25bn and Pounds 1.28bn, with BZW top of the range on Pounds 1.30bn.
Preliminary results from Enterprise Oil proved a disappointment to the
market with the increase in the dividend fully expected. A number of
specialists expressed concern over the group's exploration record during
1992 and said the company's 'finding costs' had risen sharply. Enterprise
shares closed 10 down at 497p.
The rest of the oil sector found it hard to make any fresh progress,
reacting to the slide in crude oil prices, where April Brent dipped below
Dollars 19 a barrel, amid worries that Kuwait may leave Opec.
Lasmo endured more sustained selling pressure, the shares slipping a further
6 to 181p with dealers openly speculating about the likelihood of a cut in
the dividend when the preliminary figures are published on March 24.
Standard Chartered, which powered to a five and a half-year high after
revealing preliminary figures on Wednesday, gave up 13 to 703p.
Refuge was the pick of the life sector, the shares advancing 26 to 1020p
after the much better than expected 8.6 per cent rise in the dividend.
Britannic, which has a 9 per cent stake in Refuge, climbed 20 to 1270p.
Willis Corroon raced up 18 to 208p with First Boston, the US investment
bank, said to have been an aggressive buyer of the stock.
A small number of brokers, notably Kleinwort Benson, were said to have
turned more positive on Dixons, with the Silo subsidiary in the US the focus
of attention. The shares gained 4 to 235p.
Marks and Spencer continued to attract investors attention on the back of
its low historic rating and rumours of good sales. The shares rose 7 to 359p
in chunky turnover of 7.8m.
Covering of positions by one marketmaker squeezed Iceland Frozen Foods up 23
at one stage, before slipping to close 15 ahead at 738p.
A buy recommendation from Lehman brothers coupled with an upgrading of
profit expectations from NatWest Securities boosted BAA and the shares ended
7 better at 800p.
Shares in Rolls-Royce had a volatile session as the company reported
results. They fell initially as the market reacted to a loss of Pounds 184m,
far greater than anticipated, but including an exceptional charge of Pounds
268m. This was however later taken by the market to be a positive
restructuring move that should benefit the company and taken with the lower
than anticipated dividend cut, helped the shares rally to close a net 2 1/2
better at 131 1/2 p, in hefty trade of 17m. Mr Keith Hodgkinson at Lehman
Brothers - who said 'it looks like the company has actually got to grips
with the problems' - is predicting profits for this year of Pounds 115m. Mr
Clive Forrestier-Walker at Charter House Tilney is more cautious and has
penciled in Pounds 95m for 1993 profits.
Elsewhere in the sector, the improved dividend at TI Group as it reported
figures helped the shares add 6 to 316p.
Amstrad jumped 4 1/4 to 35 1/2 p on turnover of 20m shares, the heaviest
since July last year, after news that it will launch a 'personal digital
assistant' computer in London next week.
