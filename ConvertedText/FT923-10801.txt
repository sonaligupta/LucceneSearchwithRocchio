FT  28 JUL 92 / Algiers blast linked to fundamentalists


   By AP


TENSION between the Algerian government and Islamic fundamentalists
continued to smolder yesterday as a home-made bomb exploded near a police
station in the Algiers neighbourhood of Belcourt, AP reports.
Though no one claimed responsibility for the bombing, it bore the hallmarks
of a wave of attacks by fundamentalists on police and troops in retaliation
for a harsh crackdown on their movement.
No one was injured in the blast, which occurred in one of the capital's
fundamentalist strongholds. The attack followed a bombing early on Saturday
in el-Khroub, eastern Algeria, which left three people dead and several
others injured. Bombs also exploded last week at a cinema in an Algiers
suburb and at the capital's main post office.
The Front for Socialist Forces, a democratic opposition party, said
yesterday the attacks showed that the campaign to crush the fundamentalists
had failed. 'Repression is incapable, by itself, of resolving a problem that
is eminently political,' it said.
State radio reported that 26 people were detained on Sunday on unspecified
charges in Djelfa 125 miles south of Algiers, after clashes between
fundamentalists and police on Friday left one person dead and two injured.
The latest bombing followed the arrest of commanders of Algeria's
presidential guard and special forces and eight others in connection with
last month's assassination of Mohamed Boudiaf, head of the ruling High State
Committee.
