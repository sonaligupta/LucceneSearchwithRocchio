FT  28 APR 94 / People: Vice-Admiral to steer BSI


Retired Vice-Admiral Sir Neville Purvis has been appointed chief executive
of the British Standards Institution.
Sir Neville served until February as Chief of Fleet Support in the Royal
Navy. BSI says Sir Neville has 'extensive experience at senior management
level in a complex and diverse organisation like BSI'.
The BSI has been without a chief executive at the bridge since last year
when Michael Sanderson stepped down after 18 months over what the BSI called
a 'deep disagreement on important matters of policy and management'. The BSI
will not expand on the disagreement.
BSI's problems came to a head last November when a row with its members
turned down plans to strengthen the powers of the directors and to double
directors' fees.
Sir Neville said yesterday that the BSI had faced 'problems of communication
rather than substance'. He said the BSI was an important conduit between
industry and the international organisations where many standards are now
agreed.
