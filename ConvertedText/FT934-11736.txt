third period

   MEXICO CITY


VITRO, Mexico's dominant glass maker, reported consolidated net profits of
Dollars 546m new pesos (Dollars 175m) in the first nine months of the year,
an increase in real terms of just under 1 per cent over the same period last
year.
The company's results continued to be affected by Mexico's high real
interest rates, sluggish demand for glass products and the appreciation of
the peso in real terms against the US dollar.
More than half of Vitro's earnings are denominated in US dollars.
Vitro's operating income rose to 931m pesos, a 5.5 per cent real increase
over the same period last year. Sales reached 8,235m pesos, a 2.7 per cent
gain.
Exports continued to be a bright spot, climbing to Dollars 326m, a 13.4 per
cent increase in dollar terms.
Vitro said it reduced its workforce to 41,040 people from 47,913 at the end
of the third quarter last year.
