FT  30 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Tunstall advances 16% despite difficult
markets


   By PETER PEARSE


Tunstall Group, market leader in emergency communications systems for the
elderly, lifted pre-tax profits by 16 per cent from Pounds 6.47m to Pounds
7.53m in the year to September 30.
Mr Michael Dawson, chairman, said this had been a 'satisfactory performance
in difficult markets'. Turnover grew 12 per cent to Pounds 50.1m (Pounds
44.8m) and operating profits rose to Pounds 7.21m (Pounds 6.24m). The
acquisition of a Dutch subsidiary contributed Pounds 1.55m to the former and
Pounds 51,000 to the latter.
The core Tunstall Telecom supplies and maintains hardware, software and
emergency systems to the public sector, since the transfer of the Care in
the Community programme from local authorities to social services.
Mr Dawson was pleased with PiperNet, the group's management information
systems which he sees as the main engine of growth in the UK. While Tunstall
has competitors in the emergency communications field, PiperNet - into which
it has invested some Pounds 3m - is unique and under application for
patents.
Tunstall Electronics used to make electronic devices - such as satellite
decoders, test equipment for the telecoms industry and products for virtual
reality systems - for external manufacturers. This company now only
manufactures for other Tunstall companies, while Mion Electronics was
created as a contract manufacturing business.
Mion and Tunstall Electronics up to January made only Pounds 236,000 (Pounds
495,000 from the previous Tunstall arm) after heavy start-up costs. Turnover
was Pounds 5.85m (Pounds 3.58m). Demand increased for the non-UK companies
and they turned over almost Pounds 11m. However Germany was the exception
and manufacturing there is being relocated in the UK.
Interest receivable slipped to Pounds 246,000 (Pounds 263,000) and the cash
pile fell to Pounds 3.72m (Pounds 6.42m). Earnings rose to 15.2p (13.5p
adjusted for January's 1-for-1 scrip) and a raised final dividend of 2.5p
(2.25p) gives a total of 3.85p (3.5p).
