FT  29 JUL 92 / Letter: Privatisation plan not a viable option


   From Mr EDWIN FLEMING


Sir, It was with a strong feeling of deja vu that I read your article about
Companies House which stated that 'supporters of civil service privatisation
have long argued that Companies House is an ideal candidate for
privatisation . . .' ('Companies House review is ordered', July 25).
Nearly 10 years ago the government announced that it planned to privatise
the Companies Registration Office Office (as Companies House was then
called). The proposal did not succeed because, under the First Companies
Directive (EEC Directive 68/151), the information which is held by Companies
House has to be made available to inquirers by post 'at a price not
exceeding the administrative cost thereof'.
Where profit is forbidden by law, whence privatisation?
