FT  13 APR 94 / UK Company News: Dolphin Packaging leaps 63%


Dolphin Packaging, which supplies its products mainly to the food industry,
consolidated its advance at the interim stage with a strong second half, and
reported a 63 per cent improvement for the 1993 year.
On turnover up by Pounds 610,000 to Pounds 26.3m, pre-tax profits rose by
almost Pounds 1m to Pounds 2.46m.
Mr Moger Woolley, chairman, said the advance had been achieved despite
continued price pressures and product changes in all the group's markets,
and while turnover had risen by only 2.5 per cent, volume and tonnage had
increased by some 10 per cent.
The group continued to generate cash, Mr Woolley said, with the net figure
rising by Pounds 378,000 to Pounds 2.38m at the year end.
A same-again final dividend of 2.8p is proposed to maintain the total at
4.5p.
The dividend is covered 1.7 times by earnings per share up by 48 per cent to
7.72p (5.22p).
