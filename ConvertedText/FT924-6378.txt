FT  21 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Gardiner accounts 'overstated' by Pounds
4.8m


   By JANE FULLER


THE SHARE price of Gardiner Group, the UK-based distributor of security and
surveillance products, plummeted from 15 1/2 p to 8 1/2 p yesterday after
the company announced there had been a Pounds 4.8m overstatement in the 1991
accounts.
Gardiner's directors said they believed 'the mis-statement resulted from the
deliberate falsification of the company's records'.
Mr Harvey Samson, who took over as finance director in June, said profits
had been overstated up to October 1991, but it was not known how far back
the problem went. He replaced Mr Ian Nellist, who resigned in January.
Gardiner's shares have fallen from 69p in September last year. The 1990-91
pre-tax profit figure of Pounds 6.03m was significantly below City
expectations.
Mr Samson said the mis-stated figures mainly related to stocks of burglar
alarms. The two subsidiaries acquired last year - Multi-Video Distributors
and AW Alarm System - were not involved. A Pounds 10.6m rights issue, at 52p
a share, accompanied those purchases.
The problem was picked up internally after the October 31 year-end
stock-taking. Ernst & Young, the group's auditors, had helped quantify the
amount involved. Outside accountants would be asked to mount a full
investigation.
After a tax rebate, the amount knocked off the October 31 1991 net assets
figure would be Pounds 3.5m, leaving a total of Pounds 16.2m. Figures for
that year's stocks, creditors and profit and loss account would also be
restated, said Mr Samson.
There was no material effect on profits earned since October 1991, which
were 'believed to be in line with the board's expectations'. The tax rebate
would benefit cash flow.
