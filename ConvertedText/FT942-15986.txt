FT  13 APR 94 / Norway wins gas export deals


   By KAREN FOSSLI

Norway has secured three contracts valued at an estimated NKr8bn (Pounds
746m) to supply a total of 13bn cubic metres of natural gas to Britain,
Germany and Spain.
The biggest of the three export contracts announced yesterday has been
agreed with Mobil Erdgas-Erdol of Germany, which is to take 10bn cubic
metres (10 bcm) of gas over an 18-year period, commencing in 1996.
Enagas of Spain is being supplied with close to 1 bcm of associated gas from
Norwegian North Sea oil fields over a two-year period ending in March 1996.
But the Pounds 100m deal for Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, and
Norsk Hydro, Norway's biggest publicly quoted company, to supply Britain's
ScottishPower with 1.7 bcm from the Froey field from the end of next year is
expected to bring to a head a three-year conflict over imports of Norwegian
gas by Britain which Norway claims are being blocked by the British
government.
The impasse centres on a deal valued at more than NKr20bn agreed in 1991 for
Norway to supply National Power, the UK utility, with 30.8 bcm of gas over
14 years through the Frigg gas pipeline. The British government insists that
a treaty covering the supply of Frigg gas to Britain through the Frigg
pipeline will have to be amended in order for new supplies from Norway to
make their way to the UK.
The Norwegians disagree and have privately expressed fears that the British
government will not approve the deal because of the political sensitivities
of importing foreign gas at a time when UK coal pits are being closed and
because of indigenous UK gas which could meet domestic demand.
Under the terms of the Frigg treaty, only Frigg field gas can be transported
through the Frigg pipeline.
