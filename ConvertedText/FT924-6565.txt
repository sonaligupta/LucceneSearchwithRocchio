FT  20 NOV 92 / International Company News: Depositors leave Bank Summa


   By WILLIAM KEELING

BANK Summa, the troubled Indonesian bank which was suspended from clearing
operations last week with bad debts of over Rp1,000bn (Dollars 487m),
re-opened yesterday for small-scale depositors to make withdrawals.
Under a rescue plan supported by a consortium of about 17 private banks,
customers with deposits of up to Rp10m were allowed to withdraw their
savings. From dawn, queues were reported at many of its more than 200
branches as thousands decided to clear their accounts.
Bank Summa has about 150,000 depositors, of which up to 90 per cent may
qualify for the rescue package.
Executives of the consortium's banks, which have raised over Rp150bn to
support the operation, have privately said they are participating only under
pressure from Bank Indonesia, the central bank.
Dr Adrianus Mooy, central bank governor, said on Monday that no central bank
funds would be made available to rescue Bank Summa. He noted that, while the
rescue package would assist small-scale depositors, the withdrawal of their
funds would make a restructuring of Bank Summa more difficult.
Bank Summa is owned by the Soeryadjaya family, who are also majority
shareholders in Astra International, Indonesia's second largest company.
Last week, the Soeryadjayas sold 40m Astra shares for Dollars 197m. Bankers
say they may have to relinquish much of their remaining stake, valued at
over Dollars 500m, to cover the bank's debts, over half of which are owed by
companies in which the Soeryadjayas hold an interest.
Astra's share price closed yesterday at Rp8,500, down 16 per cent for the
week and 40 per cent since mid-year.
