FT  10 JAN 92 / Observer: Tie-up


While we're talking about Mongolia and exclusive neck-wear, a further link
between them is in evidence in Gstaad, Switzerland, where the Savoy
Gastronomes are holding their twenty-first annual reunion.
Members of the club, limited to former receptionists at London's Savoy
Hotel, wear a pink and grey striped tie modelled on the table cloths at
their erstwhile workplace. And one of the 100-plus gathered for a weekend's
eating and skiing is Udo Hahn, general manager of Holiday Inn's new Chinggis
Khaan hotel in Ulan Bator.
Founder Gastronome Julian Payne, who went on to senior positions at the
Savoy, Dorchester and the Ritz, says the club's first dinner, in 1971, took
place at the Connaught. The Savoy didn't like the idea of former employees
eating in its private dining rooms. It has, however, since relented.
