FT  15 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Beverley at Pounds 63,000 after
reconstruction


BEVERLEY Group, the engineering concern formerly known as Petrocon, reported
pre-tax profits of Pounds 63,000 for 1992 against losses of Pounds 2.57m.
Turnover was ahead 5 per cent at Pounds 19.3m, against Pounds 18.3m.
During the period the company failed to acquire James Wilkes in a
hostile bid and underwent a capital reconstruction. The
the Clydebank Engineering offshoot went into members' voluntary
liquidation at the end of last year and Gorseline has been sold.
Mr Colin Robinson, chairman and chief executive, said that manufacturing
division was trading satisfactorily with quotation activity at record
levels.
Extraordinary charges of Pounds 339,000 (Pounds 2.15m), related to a payment
under an on-demand performance bond, losses on the sale of Gorseline and
costs incurred in the Wilkes bid. Retained losses were Pounds 73,000 (Pounds
4.52m).
The final is passed. An interim of 0.625p was the only dividend in the
previous year.
