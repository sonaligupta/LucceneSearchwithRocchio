FT  30 APR 94 / International Company News: Strong US sales boost Ford
profits


   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent


Ford of the US, the world's second largest vehicle maker, more than doubled
net profits to Dollars 1.3bn in the first quarter (excluding a one-off
charge for the sale of First Nationwide Bank) from Dollars 572m in the
corresponding period a year ago.
Including the charge of Dollars 440m for the sale of First Nationwide to
First Madison Bank, net income rose by 58 per cent to Dollars 904m.
The earnings of all the big three US vehicle makers, General Motors, Ford
and Chrysler, are rising sharply in response to the strong increase in new
vehicle demand in the US.
Ford, which is recovering from heavy losses in 1991 and 1992, said profits
had been rising for five quarters in a row.
Earnings in the first three months of 1994 were the fourth highest
first-quarter profits in its history behind the three record years at the
end of the 1980s.
The recovery in financial performance is being powered by Ford's US
automotive operations, which achieved a seven-fold increase in net income to
Dollars 835m in the first three months, the third best quarter on record,
from Dollars 113m in the same period a year ago.
'Our worldwide automotive earnings in the first quarter alone were greater
than in all of 1993 because of substantial improvement in our US results,'
said Mr Alex Trotman, chairman.
Net income from worldwide automotive operations jumped to Dollars 955m, the
best quarter since the second period of 1989, from Dollars 176m a year ago,
with earnings outside the US virtually doubling to Dollars 120m from Dollars
63m.
The financial services group had virtually unchanged net earnings of Dollars
389m, against Dollars 396m, excluding the one-off charge for the sale of
First Nationwide. Including the charge the division had a net loss of
Dollars 51m.
Turnover worldwide rose 13.4 per cent to Dollars 30.4bn from Dollars 26.8bn,
helped by a 9.2 per cent rise in vehicle sales to 1.67m from 1.53m a year
ago.
Despite its strong financial performance in the US, Ford lost market share
there, outperformed both by GM and Chrysler, and by some Japanese and
European carmakers. Its share of the combined US car and truck market fell
to 24.8 per cent (including Jaguar) from 25.7 per cent a year ago.
Ford is optimistic about continuing growth in US new vehicle demand and
forecast a 9.2 per cent increase in sales in the whole of 1994 to 15.5m from
14.2m last year.
Marketing costs in the US, including discounts and incentives, fell to 9.2
per cent of gross revenues in the quarter from 11.6 per cent a year ago but
were still high by historical standards, said the group.
