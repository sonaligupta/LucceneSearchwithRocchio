FT  16 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Third quarter increase for ADT


   By PAUL TAYLOR


ADT, the security and car auction group which does much of its business in
the US but retains a UK quote, yesterday reported a 10.5 per cent increase
in third quarter pre-tax profits but a slight decline in earnings per share.
The Bermuda-registered group announced pre-tax profits of Dollars 36.9m
(Pounds 24.4m) in the three months to September 30, up from Dollars 33.4m,
on sales ahead 4.8 per cent to Dollars 354.9m (Dollars 338.5m). This boosted
the profit figure for the nine months to Dollars 105.6m against Dollars
109m.
However, a higher Dollars 5.4m (Dollars 2.5m) tax charge at three months,
coupled with the issue of 20.7m new shares as part of the August refinancing
package, resulted in a fall in earnings per share from 24 cents to 22 cents.
Nevertheless, ADT's share rose 3p to close at 603p.
Mr Michael Ashcroft, chairman and chief executive, said ADT's businesses
'continued to perform in line with management's expectations'.
The main increase in operating profits came in the security services
division which reported operating income of Dollars 39.1m (Dollars 36.9m) on
sales which increased to Dollars 231.3m (Dollars 225.3m).
In North America a further 37,000 new residential alarm systems were sold
during the third quarter, representing a 26 per cent increase over last
year.
Commercial sector sales were stronger in the US Midwest, south-east and
western regions with some signs of improvement in the north-east and
mid-Atlantic regions.
In Canada, however, the directors said that business was unlikely to be up
to expectations until there were more positive signs of an economic upturn.
Operating profit in the vehicle auctions division dipped to Dollars 15.1m
(Dollars 15.8m) although sales increased to Dollars 84.4m (Dollars 80.2m).
The number of vehicles consigned to ADT auctions in the US rose by 20 per
cent over the 1992 period while in the UK the volume of vehicles sold
increased by 7 per cent. Exchange rate movements, however, meant that the
contribution from the UK in dollar terms fell.
ADT's other expenses, less income, figure moved from a net expense of
Dollars 6m in the third quarter last time to a gain of Dollars 200,000, more
than offsetting an increase in net interest.
