FT  16 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Commission pays up within recommended
time


   From Mr RANIERO VANNI D'ARCHIRAFI


Sir, I would like to reassure Mr Greg Perry (Letters, December 10/11) that
the European Commission does respect the payment delays suggested for member
states and business in its November 30 recommendation. The average delay for
all payments made by the Commission during the first 11 months of 1994 was
40.5 days, well below the 60 days recommended. Only a few of the
Commission's payments (less than 10 per cent) took longer than 60 days, and
in most cases these delays were the result of irregularities with the
invoices.
Raniero Vanni d'Archirafi,
Member of the European
Commission,
