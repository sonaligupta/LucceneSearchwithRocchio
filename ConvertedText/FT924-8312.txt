   By REUTER


Southern Russia's rebel Chechen leader yesterday threatened to declare war
on Moscow if it did not withdraw troops from around his republic's borders,
Reuter reports. General Dzhokhar Dudayev imposed a state of emergency,
mobilised most adult males and called on people 'to rise up in defence of
Chechen independence'. He claimed Russian forces were on Chechen territory
and gave them until today to pull out peacefully.
