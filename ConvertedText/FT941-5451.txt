FT  07 MAR 94 / Hopes rise over UK-Malaysia row


   By Our Foreign Staff


Hopes rose yesterday for an amicable resolution to the storm over the Pergau
dam scheme, and the bar on British companies receiving Malaysian government
contracts, Our Foreign Staff writes.
In a television interview, the Malaysian High Commissioner in London, Mr Abu
Kamaradin, hinted that diplomatic exchanges were in progress. 'We are
talking to diplomatic channels and we have excellent contacts because of the
good relations over the years. Therefore we are quite confident that this
matter can be resolved amicably,' he said.
And in a letter to The Times newspaper today, Mr Khalid Jaafar, press
secretary to deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim, writes that Kuala Lumpur
is not seeking an apology for British press reporting of the affair, only
'factual reporting'.
However, in Malaysia there was little indication of an early settlement of
the dispute.
Last night Mrs Rafidah Aziz, the minister of trade and industry, said the
British media had no right to meddle in the domestic affairs of other
countries. 'As long as the media there chooses to be arrogant and not face
reality, we will not award contracts to the British,' she said.
The minister added that Malaysia had nothing to lose by barring British
companies from seeking government contracts. But senior Malaysian officials
have privately expressed fears that a prolonged row with Britain could
damage the local economy.
Malaysia announced the ban in retaliation for what it said was 'the
patronising attitude and innuendoes' contained in British media reports. Dr
Mahathir Mohamad, the premier, was angered by a report that a British
construction company was prepared to offer him a bribe to win a contract.
