FT  23 NOV 92 / SBC sets deadline for payment of debt

OLYMPIA & YORK'S efforts to keep its US operations out of bankruptcy
protection are again being threatened by disgruntled creditors.
Swiss Bank Corporation has extended until tonight a deadline for O&Y to pay
USDollars 8m (Pounds 5.2m) which it owes under a letter of credit related to
one of its New York properties.
The bank had earlier set a deadline of 1pm last Friday.
In a separate action, Battery Park Holdings (BPH), which is partly owned by
Toronto's Bronfman family, has filed a suit to recover USDollars 8.5m in
overdue debt-service payments from the World Financial Centre, O&Y's
flagship development in lower Manhattan.
BPH is also claiming USDollars 75m in capital which it alleges was
improperly withdrawn by O&Y from the World Financial Centre to support less
healthy operations elsewhere within its empire.
O&Y's 25 US buildings, most of them in New York, are the only part of the
Reichmann empire which remain outside court protection.
The company has indicated that it will file for protection under Chapter 11
of the US bankrutpcy code if either Swiss Bank Corporation or Battery Park
Holdings attempt to enforce their claims.
Other creditors have so far stopped short however, of forcing O&Y into the
time-consuming and complex Chapter 11 route.
Most have preferred either to resolve their claims through negotiation or
have decided to adopt a wait-and-see attitude.
