FT  29 APR 94 / World Trade News: Czech plant for Westvaco

Westvaco, the New York-based US paper and packaging company, will establish
its first European plant in the Czech Republic as a springboard to markets
in central and eastern Europe, the company announced yesterday.
The state of the art packaging plant to be built at Svitavy, about 120km
east of Prague, will require an initial investment of Dollars 25m (Pounds
17.1m), but further investment will follow as business expands. 'We would
expect that amount to be doubled over the course of the decade,' Mr John
Luke, chief executive, said.
The plant will manufacture packaging materials and will be the first of its
kind in central and eastern Europe, Mr Luke said. Production will start in
late 1995.
Westvaco has had a sales and distribution company in Brussels for about 30
years, but this is its first manufacturing venture in Europe.
Following the opening up of the former communist countries several packaging
companies plan to move into the region leading to fierce competition. This
month, Austrian-based Mayr-Melnhof, one of Europe's top carton board and
packaging groups, raised Dollars 270m to finance acquisitions in west and
east Europe.
