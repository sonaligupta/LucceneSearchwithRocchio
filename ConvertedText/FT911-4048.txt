FT  22 APR 91 / Letter: Equity on property valuable and popular security


   From Mr OSMAN STREATER


Sir, Some time ago, you published a trenchant article saying that the
Conservative government 'has undermined the long-run financial security of
many individuals' (The Long View, January 6). It had, you warned, done this
by deciding to wind down the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme, even
though the UK was spending only 7.5 per cent of national income on state
pensions, as against 14 per cent in France and Germany. Millions of
investors in the new personal pensions, you stated, 'have no idea what
benefits their contributions will eventually buy' - the implication being
that they would be sorely disappointed.
Later, you published another editorial decrying the rise in capital value of
housing during the lifetime of the same government ('Housing and inflation',
April 16). 'A modified capital gains tax', you suggest, 'should be applied
to owner-occupied housing.'
For many people in this country, the rise in the capital value of their
house provides the best long-term security they can expect. Yes, those rises
in value have been much more marked in Britain than in France and Germany.
But then in France and Germany the state does more for its pensioners than
is done in the UK.
Like mortgage interest relief, the ability to use the growing equity in the
value of one's house for purposes of one's own choosing is not just, as you
say, one of 'Mrs Thatcher's sacred cows'. It is universally popular. It is
needed. And it takes the place of benefits which British governments, unlike
French and German ones, are not prepared to provide for their citizens. So
why can't it be left alone?
