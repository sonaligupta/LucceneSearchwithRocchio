FT  12 NOV 92 / Technology: House on skis sets sail


   By FIONA MCWILLIAM


Western housing markets may be in the doldrums, but at least home owners do
not face having to move every few years or risk being crushed by tonnes of
ice.
That is the situation on Antarctica's Brunt Ice Shelf, where winter
temperatures can fall to minus 30 deg C and the wind causes snow to drift
for 180 days a year. The extreme conditions and continuous lateral movement
of the ice mean that buildings become buried and subsequently crushed.
This makes the long-term survival of fixed structures impossible. So the
battery of vehicles supporting the British Antarctic Survey's (BAS)
southernmost research station is currently maintained in a garage
constructed within the ice.
But this is expensive, and the BAS recently opted for a mobile structure - a
prefabricated steel garage mounted on two skis - which it will move to a new
location every few months. Two bulldozers will twist the garage free from
the ice before dragging it to a new site.
The BAS is confident that the structure, produced from high-grade steel,
will survive more than a few years of service at the Halley Research
Station, where measurements of ozone depletion revealed the 'hole' in 1985.
The mobile garage was manufactured by Yorkshire company VM Fabrications and
designed by sister company Bennett Associates. It is a fully independent
unit, with its own generator and heating systems.
Its base incorporates a sump into which used oil will drain before being
shipped away from the base, in accordance with the Antarctic Treaty. The
skis are coated with the same hot-application, low-friction paint used on
the hull of a recently commissioned BAS research ship.
The garage is on its way to the Brunt Ice Shelf aboard the BAS vessel RRS
Bransfield. Weather permitting, it will be ready for the servicing and
repair of vehicles by the end of January.
