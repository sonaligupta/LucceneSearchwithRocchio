FT  25 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Carolco secures Dollars 73.8m
of financing


   By KAREN ZAGOR


   NEW YORK


CAROLCO, the troubled independent Hollywood film studio, yesterday said it
had secured Dollars 73.8m of financing from its foreign investors and has
access to an additional Dollars 23m in new bank loans, which should be
sufficient to continue operating.
Carolco's foreign minority shareholders include Pioneer of Japan, Rizzoli of
Italy and Canal Plus of France.
Carolco, along with other independent film companies such as Orion Pictures,
has been caught in a financial squeeze. In December, Carolco cut its staff
of 200 by 25 per cent and said it was considering reducing the number of
deals with film-makers.
Problems at the company, which started mounting last summer, forced it to
cut off talks aimed at acquiring a 46 per cent stake in the Live
Entertainment home video supplier in November. Carolco still holds a 53 per
cent stake in Live.
The company, which is best know for its Terminator and Rambo films, was in
technical default on Dollars 172m of bank loans for much of last year.
The details of yesterday's financing and restructuring are not significantly
different from a package arranged two months ago, although the amount of
funding has increased. In January, Carolco said it had secured Dollars 45m
of financing and a deferral on Dollars 10m of debts from its US and foreign
lenders.
The major differences include the Dollars 23m in new loans that Carolco's
banks have made available to the company. Carolco's bankers include Bankers
Trust, Chemical Bank and Credit Lyonnais Bank Nederland. In addition,
Carolco's investors have agreed to fund up to Dollars 13.8m of potential
bank collateral shortfalls.
While the arrangement should help Carolco keep operating in the short-term,
the company said it 'anticipates that its operations could require
additional sources of funds.'
