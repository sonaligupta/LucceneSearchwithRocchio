FT  28 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls to
five-year closing low


Tokyo
THE NIKKEI average fell to a new five-year closing low, as small-lot selling
by companies and investment trusts depressed share prices amid thin volume,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average closed down 248.50 at 19,636.99, the lowest since
February 1987 and down 2.7 per cent on the week. The index briefly hit the
day's high of 19,942.79 but fell on light selling to the day's low of
19,587.11 just before the close.
Volume remained at 180m shares. Foreign investors, who had been steady
buyers during the past few weeks, were absent. A foreign broker said that
the weakness in the Nikkei could prompt foreign investors to reassess their
asset allocations.
Declines outnumbered advances by 678 to 278 with 154 issues unchanged. The
Topix index of all first section stocks fell 18.63 to 1,428.13 and in
London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.44 to 1,119.58.
Market participants were discouraged by comments by government officials
'talking down' hopes pinned to an economic stimulus package due to be
announced next week. An official of the Economic Planning Agency said that
the business sector was more bearish towards the economy than actual
economic conditions warranted, and Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister,
said long-term interest rates were declining steadily.
Mr Peter Johnson at Baring Securities said next week's announcement held
critical importance in judging the government's attitude towards reviving
the economy.
Rumours of financial trouble at a leading non-bank financial institution due
to extensive investments in speculative issues also depressed share prices.
Speculative favourites plunged on the rumours. Minebea, the most active
issue of the day, fell Y44 to Y465 and Clarion plunged Y130 to Y910.
High-technology issues were lower on small-lot liquidations by institutional
investors. Hitachi fell Y9 to Y780 and Matsushita Electric Industrial
declined Y10 to Y1,270.
Mitsubishi Motors fell Y38 to Y612 on news that Chrysler, the US car maker
had sold 43.6m shares, or half of its stake, in Mitsubishi for Y27.5bn.
Light index selling depressed Nikkei index component stocks with low
liquidity. Shimura Kako fell Y100 to Y780 and Godo Shusei retreated Y130 to
Y1,140.
Drug related stocks lost ground on the sharp fall of Mochida Pharmaceutical,
which fell Y490 to Y3,160 on selling by short-term players. Meiji Milk
Products lost Y37 to Y841 and Okamoto Industries fell Y40 to Y1,140.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 257.47 to 21,269.03 in volume of 107.9m
shares.
