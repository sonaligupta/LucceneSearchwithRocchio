FT  22 JUL 94 / International Company News: AT&T in solid 11.2% advance


   By PATRICK HARVERSON and RICHARD TOMKINS


AT&T, the largest US telecommunications group, yesterday reported solid
second-quarter profits of Dollars 1.13bn, or 83 cents a share, an increase
of 11.2 per cent.
In the same quarter a year ago the group earned Dollars 1.01bn, or 74 cents
restated to account for accounting changes.
The second-quarter profits took first-half 1994 earnings to Dollars 2.22bn.
A year ago, AT&T reported a first-half loss of Dollars 5.8bn, but excluding
the impact of accounting changes, earnings in the period totalled Dollars
1.94bn.
The improvement in second-quarter results was attributed by AT&T to strong
revenue growth from its long-distance telecommunications, equipment
manufacturing and financial services businesses.
Total revenues in the quarter were Dollars 17.7bn, up 8.7 per cent from a
year earlier.
On Wall Street, the shares closed Dollars  1/2 higher at Dollars 53 5/8 .
McCaw Cellular Communications, the US mobile phone company about to be taken
over by AT&T in an all-share deal worth Dollars 12.6bn, made its first-ever
profit in its last quarter as an independent company, it reported yesterday,
writes Richard Tomkins.
In the three months to June it made net profits of Dollars 137m, or 65 cents
a share, compared to losses of Dollars 22.1m, or 11 cents last time.
Revenues rose 26 per cent to Dollars 682.7m.
