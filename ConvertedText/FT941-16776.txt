FT  07 JAN 94 / Paris plans savings market reform


   By ALICE RAWSTHORN


Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French economy minister, yesterday confirmed that
he plans to table legislation for a radical reform of the Caisse des Depots
et Consignations, the state-controlled savings institution, writes Alice
Rawsthorn.
The reform of the Caisse des Depots, an idiosyncratic institution which
dominates the French savings system and is involved with public sector
funding, has been mooted since last March when Mr Edouard Balladur's
centre-right coalition government took office.
France's banks have lobbied for it to be dismantled in order to open up the
savings market. Mr Alphandery said he 'did not favour the dismemberment' of
the Caisse des Depots.
However, he said he felt that its public sector interests and competitive
activities should be separated.
The plan to reform the Caisse des Depots forms part of the Balladur
government's general economic programme of liberalising France's financial
institutions.
Other measures include the granting of independence to the Bank of France
and the privatisation of Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) and Credit
Lyonnais, the main state-controlled banks.
