FT  24 MAR 92 / Warning on accounting proposals


   By ANDREW JACK


PROPOSALS to change the structure of the profit-and-loss account will be
costly and make company accounts more confusing, the Chartered Institute of
Management Accountants (Cima) said yesterday.
Cima also said in its response to the proposed financial reporting standard
issued by the Accounting Standards Board late last year that the definition
of some of the information required was unclear.
It called for accounting standards to be 'field-tested' on companies and
then refined.
Cima also argued that requirements for additional information in the
accounts were often justified on their own, but collectively risked
'cluttering' the profit-and-loss account and reducing its usefulness.
The institute said information on revenue investment - expenditure leading
to increased future earnings - was often not collected as part of existing
management information, and the requirement for disclosure would therefore
involve additional costs.
