Lotus Development, the US personal computer software company, recorded
higher-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings, reflecting strong sales of its
programs for electronic mail applications, writes Louise Kehoe in San
Francisco.
Net income for the quarter was Dollars 29.6m, or 64 cents a share, a 103 per
cent increase over last year's fourth-quarter net income of Dollars 14.6m,
or 35 cents.
Last year the company recorded a pre-tax gain of Dollars 15m from the sale
of securities offset by a Dollars 15m pre-tax restructuring charge.
Fourth-quarter revenue rose to a record Dollars 278.3m from Dollars 246m in
the same period a year earlier.
For the full year, revenues grew to Dollars 981.2m from Dollars 900.1m in
1992. Before one-time items in both years, net income in 1993 rose 32 per
cent to Dollars 75.4m, or Dollars 1.69, from Dollars 57.2m, or Dollars 1.33,
in 1992.
Net income for 1993, including a charge of Dollars 19.9m related to the
acquisition of Approach Software, was Dollars 55.5m, or Dollars 1.24. For
1992, net income, including a pre-tax gain of Dollars 49.7m from the sale of
securities and a Dollars 15m pre-tax restructuring charge, was Dollars
80.4m, or Dollars 1.87.
Mr Jim Manzi, president and chief executive, said sales of Notes and
cc:Mail, two communications software products, had been strong.
Lotus also expanded its share of the market for applications designed to run
with Microsoft's widely used Windows software, he said.
