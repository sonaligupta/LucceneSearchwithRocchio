FT  20 JUL 94 / Observer: Struck down


Ha - hoist by their own petards.
Statisticians and analysts of the Labour Statistics Users group were due to
meet at the Trades Union Congress HQ in London today. One item on the agenda
was a discussion of how the department of employment records strikes. Sadly,
it's all off - thanks to the latest 24-hour national rail strike by
signallers.
Speaking of which, the government's department of transport has been urging
motorists to share cars as a way of beating the strikes. Not that the
department's own staff are enthusiastic about the idea.
A notice in the entrance hall of the department's London office, inviting
would-be sharers to sign up, had not a single signature on it by
clocking-off time yesterday. They can't all be driving in, surely?
