FT  06 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Taiwan power proposals


   By FRANK GRAY


TAIWAN Power, the state electricity generating monopoly, is taking steps to
diversify the island's sources of pow
If the government approves the measures will allow independent power
generators to enter the Taiwan market. They would build, own and operate
their own plants, the costs of which would be recovered through the sale of
electricity to Taipower. The plan could be the first step in a deregulation
of the sector.
According to the company, 10 sites have been selected. Initially, they would
only be open to Taiwan investors, although foreign investment would be a
logical next step. Power plants of up to 750MW could be built on the sites.
Nearly all the principal equipment would be bought from foreign suppliers.
Taiwan's aggressive power expansion programme has prompted the need for
private sector capital. Taipower's installed capacity is more than 19,000MW,
but it intends to increase this to 30,000MW by the year 2000. Analysts say
this will require an investment of at least Dollars 14bn.
The state utility, which operates 56 power stations, three of them nuclear,
wants to unload some of the burden of environmental responsibility on the
private sector. Taiwan's environmental lobby has been active in opposing new
power stations, particularly the proposed 2,300MW of nuclear capacity
planned for Yenliao in northern Taiwan. The Yenliao project is currently out
to tender.
