FT  27 JAN 94 / Home repossessions fall 14%


   By ALISON SMITH


The number of homes repossessed by mortgage lenders last year fell 10,000 to
58,540 - a fall of 14.6 per cent - the Council of Mortgage Lenders said
yesterday.
This represents the second year that the annual total of repossessions has
dropped from its height of 75,540 in 1991, but is still a stark contrast
with the position 10 years ago when fewer than 9,000 homes were repossessed.
The number of repossessions in the second half of last year totalled 26,760.
The statistics released yesterday showed that the number of mortgages in
arrears has also started to decline. There were 164,620 mortgages in arrears
of six to 12 months in the second half of last year - a fall from 191,560 in
the first half of the year and from more than 200,000 in the last six months
of 1992.
The number of mortgages in longer-term arrears also fell, although not so
sharply, to 151,810 in the second half from 158,000 in the preceding six
months. Even so, that total is a record for a year-end.
Mr Adrian Coles, director-general of the council, attributed the improvement
in the figures to lower interest rates, direct payment of income support for
mortgage interest, and more effective arrears management. He said lower
levels of unemployment and the economic recovery were also beginning to make
an impact.
Compared with the early 1980s, the numbers for mortgage arrears and
repossessions are strikingly high, even though they have begun to fall. In
1983, for example, fewer than 30,000 mortgages were in arrears of six to 12
months and only about 7,500 were in arrears for longer.
Mr Frank Bartlett, head of lending at Woolwich building society,
acknowledged that there was still a significant problem to solve.
Mr Peter Williams, the council's head of research and external affairs, said
home ownership had changed so much during the 1980s that the market was
unlikely to return to its former state.
The council has recently revised its statement of practice on the way in
which its members handle arrears and repossessions. The organisation
represents building societies and centralised lenders such as banks, and now
covers about 98 per cent of the UK mortgage market.
Last year 105,283 mortgage possession orders were made by the courts, the
Lord Chancellor's Department said.
