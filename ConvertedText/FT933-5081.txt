FT  06 SEP 93 / US textiles demand angers China


   By AP


   BEIJING


China has said US demands for stricter penalties in a new textiles agreement
violate bilateral and international trade pacts, AP reports from Beijing.
Ms Jennifer Hillman, of the US trade representative's office, said on
Saturday that China must crack down on transshipment of its textiles through
third countries before a new agreement could be reached. Otherwise, the US
could limit textile imports unilaterally whenever Chinese goods were found
to cause market disruptions.
