FT  30 APR 94 / Accidents in company cars up


Company car drivers could be playing at least as big a role as thieves and
vandals in sending insurance rates soaring, according to a survey of
accident rates.
Last year more than eight out of 10 drivers employed by companies using the
Shrewsbury-based Fleet Management Services had an accident, according to its
survey.
The survey analysed reports to FMS's insurance claims management department
last year.
Directors and senior managers were the worst offenders, while the most
common form of accident - 10 per cent of the total - was hitting
obstructions while reversing.
