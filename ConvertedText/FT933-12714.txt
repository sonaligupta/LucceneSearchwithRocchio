FT  22 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: GEC in demand


   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY


In an otherwise poor session, shares in defence and electronics group GEC
bucked the market trend after a large institution moved to buy the stock.
Fund management group Robert Fleming was believed to have issued a buy order
for GEC. The institution was reported to have placed its order with BZW,
which was known to have a large buying order early in the session.
The stock responded by rising 5 to 329p, in hefty volume of 7.5m shares.
Broker Williams de Broe yesterday reiterated its buy recommendation on the
stock, suggesting it should be on a premium rating given its exposure to the
cyclical cycle.
