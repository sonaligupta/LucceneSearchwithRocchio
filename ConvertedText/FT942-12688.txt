FT  28 APR 94 / UK Company News: Compass seeks funds for US purchase -
Rights issue launched towards Dollars 450m Canteen Corporation acquisition


   By DAVID BLACKWELL


Compass Group, the catering and healthcare concern, yesterday launched a
rights issue to raise almost Pounds 146m towards the cost of buying the
third biggest caterer in the US for Dollars 450m (Pounds 308m).
The purchase is Canteen Corporation, based in South Carolina, which for 1993
produced an operating income of Dollars 38m on turnover of Dollars 1bn.
The balance of the payment will come from new bank facilities of Dollars
175m from NationsBank of North Carolina, and Pounds 47.5m from National
Westminster Bank.
The acquisition will leave the group with pro forma negative net assets of
Pounds 92.3m.
Mr Francis Mackay, chief executive, said yesterday that the acquisition was
'a one-off opportunity to buy into the world's biggest food market at a
price that is sensible'.
Compass also announced a 28 per cent rise in pre-tax profits for the six
months from Pounds 18.2m to Pounds 23.3m on turnover ahead 65 per cent at
Pounds 345.2m (Pounds 209.4m).
Mr Mackay said that all the group's acquisitions had performed 'extremely
well and we haven't lost a single contract'.
Earnings per share rose from 8.6p to 8.8p.
The interim dividend is increased from 2.115p to 2.31p, and the group is
forecasting a final of 4.5p on the enlarged capital following the rights
issue.
The shares yesterday fell a further 6p to 310p following a fall of 13p on
Tuesday when news of the impending US deal emerged.
Last July Compass, which has grown from a Pounds 167m management buy-out
from Grand Metropolitan in 1987 to a market capitalisation of Pounds 570m,
bought the airport restaurant and contract catering business of SAS Service
Partner, a subsidiary of the Scandinavian airline.
The Pounds 71.9m acquisition was financed through a 6-for-19 rights issue at
420p.
The latest cash call, also on a 6-for-19 basis, is priced at 270p and is
underwritten by Morgan Grenfell. The issue of 57.4m new ordinary shares will
raise Pounds 145.9m net of expenses. The directors will be taking up their
rights, amounting to 1.51m shares.
Canteen is being sold by Flagstar, owner of several restaurant chains,
including the Denny's breakfast bars. Flagstar, listed on Nasdaq, incurred
losses in 1993 of Dollars 1.68bn after a Dollars 1.4bn goodwill write-off,
on turnover of Dollars 4bn.
The group, which has Dollars 2.4bn of debt, is 67 per cent owned by Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts, the Wall Street buy-out specialist.
Mr Mackay said that the disposal of Canteen, which has more than 12,000
accounts and net assets of Dollars 23.8m, was essentially a forced sale. Its
acquisition would immediately enhance earnings per share.
He was confident that Compass would be able to lift margins from last year's
3.3 per cent to above 5 per cent, the level achieved in 1990 and 1991.
Canteen had suffered from lack of management, including one contract that
had notched up a loss of Dollars 500,000. It had also suffered from
over-dependency on business and industry accounts, and needed to be directed
more towards the growing, college, hospital and prison market.
Following the acquisition Compass will have more than 50,000 employees,
double the current number.
It will retain the relatively new US management of Canteen, under the
supervision of Mr Mike Bailey, who joined Compass 12 months ago as managing
director of the brand management arm.
Compass and Flagstar have made a US tax election under which both parties
have agreed to capitalise goodwill over 15 years. This was worth Dollars
150m to Compass, or Dollars 10m a year, and would leave it with an effective
US tax charge of 12 per cent.
Mr Mackay said the high leverage incurred under the deal was appropriate as
Canteen was cash generative. Interest cover, 12 times at the end of the
half-year, would fall to 5.8 times but would start to recover quickly.
The City, which had thought Compass would concentrate on expansion in
Europe, was surprised at the sudden switch of the group's sights to the US.
Mr Mackay said the group would continue to expand in Europe organically. 'We
are determined to grow a sizeable business in Europe in the next three or
four years', he said, adding that the US deal was a one-off opportunity to
enter 'a great market place without paying a premium'.
The EGM to approve the rights issue will be on May 13. Compass expects to
complete the acquisition on June 17.
