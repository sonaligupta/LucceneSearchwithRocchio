FT  26 MAY 93 / International Company News: French unit puts MoDo in the red

MODO, one of Sweden's leading forestry groups, suffered a SKr200m (Dollars
27.39m) loss after financial items in the first quarter.
The group warned it would remain in the red for the rest of the year, even
if market conditions showed some improvement.
The company blamed the deficit on its French unit, which recorded a loss of
SKr310m, SKr180m more than a year ago, because of low prices and the
strength of the French franc.
By contrast, it noted that its Swedish operations were back in profit,
thanks to lower production costs and the kronor's depreciation.
The latest result is an improvement on the first three months of last year
when the group made a SKr244m loss after financial items.
But the group said that despite the weaker kronor, prices for many of its
products had fallen sharply as a result of last autumn's currency
turbulence.
'We believe prices have now stopped falling. Towards the end of the year the
market situation ought to start to improve, which should increase the
chances of lifting prices,' said Mr Bengt Lof, chief executive.
Sales in the latest period rose to SKr4.32bn from SKr4.19bn and operating
profit increased to SKr164m from SKr43m.
The company said it expected a negative result this year, despite SKr700m in
cost savings. Last year, the company suffered a SKr1.7bn loss.
