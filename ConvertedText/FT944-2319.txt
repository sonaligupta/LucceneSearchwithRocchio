FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Reliance Security


Improved market conditions enabled Reliance Security Group to lift interim
pre-tax profits by 50 per cent from Pounds 991,000 to Pounds 1.49m. Turnover
was up 14 per cent to Pounds 40.2m, against Pounds 35.3m.
Mr Brian Kingham, chairman of the security services group, said the
significant rise reflected recovery from recession, benefits of economies of
scale and lower costs through investment in advanced operating systems.
Earnings per share were 4.4p (3p) and the interim dividend is stepped up
from 1.1p to 1.4p.
