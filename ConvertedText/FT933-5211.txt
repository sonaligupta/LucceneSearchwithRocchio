FT  04 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Float boost for Pittencrieff


   By DAVID BLACKWELL


THE FLOTATION in the US of a large part of its mobile communications
subsidiary boosted first-half pre-tax profits at Pittencrieff, the natural
resources and communications company, from Pounds 2.2m to Pounds 15.2m.
The flotation of Pittencrieff Communications, in which the parent retains 54
per cent, raised Dollars 68m (Pounds 45m) net of expenses. After taking a
loss on the sale of its oil field service businesses, Pittencrieff booked a
net gain on disposals of Pounds 12.9m. Excluding that, pre-tax profits for
the half year to June 30 were ahead 28 per cent at Pounds 2.3m (Pounds
1.8m).
Including disposals, earnings per share advanced from 9.4p to 53.04p.
Excluding such items earnings fell from 7.35p to 5.83p because of an
increase in the number of shares in issue and an anticipated higher tax
charge. The interim dividend is raised from 3p to 3.25p.
The group now has cash deposits net of borrowings of Pounds 30m, compared
with net borrowing at the end of last year of Pounds 5m.
Mr Terry Heneaghan, chief executive, said the company was now in a
transition period and was cash rich.
Mr Michael Munro, chairman, said the group balance sheet had been 'immensely
strengthened' by the flotation.
In May the group succeeded in a hostile bid for Aberdeen Petroleum for
Pounds 9.2m. This boosted its proved oil and gas reserves by 6.5m barrels of
oil equivalent - or about 90 per cent.
Turnover doubled to Pounds 14m, including Pounds 1.3m from discontinued
operations.
