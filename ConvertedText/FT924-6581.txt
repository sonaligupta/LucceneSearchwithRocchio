FT  20 NOV 92 / International Company News: Audi plans to shed 10% of
workforce

AUDI, the quality car division of Volkswagen, yesterday became the latest in
a line of large German companies to announce large-scale lay-offs in
response to rapidly deteriorating business conditions.
Audi said that it was planning to reduce its workforce by 3,000-4,000 people
next year. This is about 10 per cent of the 37,500 people currently employed
by the group.
The move follows similar drastic measures from other car manufacturers,
including Daimler-Benz which this week announced plans to cut 40,000 jobs by
the end of 1994, mainly in its Mercedes-Benz car subsidiary. Porsche, the
sports car company, is cutting its workforce by almost a quarter.
Audi blamed the move on the the outlook for the economy, which would be much
worse next year. The group said it was necessary to take these structural
measures in order to remain competitive in international markets and to
increase productivity further.
It said discussions over the way in which the jobs would be cut were under
way. Factories in Ingolstadt and Neckarsulm would bear the brunt of the job
losses.
Audi is expecting a significant increase in deliveries this year. However,
in October it cut back production plans from 490,000 to 470,000 vehicles.
