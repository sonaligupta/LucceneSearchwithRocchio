FT  27 SEP 94 / International Company News: Metall shares tumble 11% to 1994
low


   By ANDREW FISHER


   FRANKFURT


Shares in Metallgesellschaft fell further yesterday amid continuing concern
over the financial state of the ailing German industrial company and US
comments about the handling last year of its controversial oil losses.
As the share price fell by DM15.80, or nearly 11 per cent, to DM133.20
(Dollars 86.40) - a new low for 1994 and the lowest for many years -
Deutsche Bank denied speculation that it and other banks involved in the
company's rescue (such as Dresdner Bank) were cutting their shareholdings.
Deutsche Bank, a leading creditor as well as shareholder, denied US reports
about an alleged investigation by US authorities of the bank's role.
Deutsche Bank North America said in response to US press reports about an
investigation by the New York district attorney's office that it had not
been contacted by its officials.
Last night the attorney's office said it was inquiring into 'activities in
the US by several companies related to Metallgeselleschaft'. No charges had
been filed.
The reports centre on allegations that Deutsche Bank may, in the latter
stages, have become involved in the management of Metallgeselleschaft's
controversial US oil business, carried out through MG Corporation.
This would be against US law; Deutsche Bank said the oil expert hired to
sort out the futures contracts had never been paid by the bank.
Metallgesellschaft said it had no explanation for the continued drop in the
shares. Three weeks ago, the shares fell sharply to around DM180 on reports
of moves to reduce the share capital.
The deterioration in Metallgesellschaft's share price could also be a
response to US articles suggesting its losses on oil futures trading could
have been diminished if that business had not been liquidated so quickly.
