FT  27 JUN 92 / Letter: Too risky


   From J D BURROWS


Sir, Members of Lloyd's facing increasing catastrophe loss cannot be
expected to pay into ever mounting reserves for the continuing US asbestos
and pollution claims. These risks cannot be reinsured at Lloyd's since they
could not have been perceived at inception many decades ago and they are
outside the scope of insurance.
A moratorium should be put on increasing open syndicate reserves as these
are now far in excess of those required by other insurers with whom we
compete, and have dissipated in running costs.
As there is to be no rescue, only a levy on all names, a moratorium could
only encourage some of us to continue underwriting.
