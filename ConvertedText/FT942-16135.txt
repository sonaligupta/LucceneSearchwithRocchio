FT  12 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Gradualism has proved ineffective in
Russia


   From Professor ANDERS ASLUND


Sir, Remarkable things are happening in the Russian economy. Monthly
inflation has fallen from 22 per cent in January to 9 per cent in March,
while industrial production fell by 24 per cent in the first quarter of 1994
in comparison with the first quarter of 1993. This is a severe stabilisation
shock.
It is caused by policies introduced by Boris Fyodorov, the former finance
minister, last October after the dissolution of the Russian parliament. He
abolished subsidised credits and raised the refinance rate to 17.5 per cent
a month, that is 592 per cent a year, though it is wrongly cited by the
Russian authorities as 210 per cent a year. He kept the budget deficit at 9
per cent of gross domestic product.
A little noticed fact is that Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister,
contrary to his public statements, has maintained Fyodorov's policy. Last
month, Russia had a positive real interest rate of 9 per cent a month, or
180 per cent a year, by far the highest in the world. Therefore inflation
falls so sharply.
However, a macroeconomic stabilisation driven only by monetary policy, with
a relatively weak budgetary policy, is both socially costly and difficult to
sustain. Tax revenues are collapsing because of the tough monetary policy.
Therefore, Professor Jeffrey Sachs (Personal view, March 31) is right in
arguing for a more balanced, effective and humane stabilisation programme
with substantial and timely Western support.
Professor Padma Desai (Letters, April 6) does not understand that the prime
minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin, is delivering an extraordinary shock after
too much unintended gradualism. Unlike Desai, he has learnt that gradualism
has proved ineffective.
