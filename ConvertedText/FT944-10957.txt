FT  08 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: Nordic markets unnerved


Opinion polls showing growing opposition to Swedish membership of the
European Union, ahead of Sunday's referendum, made for further uncertainty
in Nordic markets after last week's losses.
Stockholm was broadly lower as the latest poll showed opposition to EU
membership leading support by 42 per cent to 40 per cent. In addition, said
Mr Peter Tron at Unibank Securities, the outlook for higher US and UK
interest rates, and the fact that the Bundesbank was unlikely to cut German
rates on Thursday, was a further deterrent. Mr Tron said the markets were
still discounting a 'yes' vote and added that a 'no' vote could bring a 5 to
10 per cent fall in share prices.
The Affarsvarlden general index declined 16.7 or 1.2 per cent to 1,427.2,
but Ericsson 'B' showed some resistance to the downward trend, easing only
SKr1 to SKr431, tracking a firm performance by its ADRs in New York on
Friday.
Oslo, facing its own referendum on November 28, was transfixed by
developments in Sweden, and worries that the mood could spill over. The
All-share index fell 8.5 to 590.7.
Helsinki's Hex index shed 33.28 to 1,911.63 as EU opponents succeeded in
delaying the final parliamentary vote on membership until next week, after
Sweden's referendum. Copenhagen's Top-20 KFX index dipped 0.92 to 92.27,
dragged lower by the uncertain mood in its neighbouring markets.
