FT  30 JUN 93 / Observer: Eco Mania


Market research knows no bounds. Now it is telling us which nations fall
into which categories of concern for planetary well-being.
According to Research International, Americans, Canadians, Dutch and Germans
are all 'anxious experts' - they have strong preferences for environmentally
friendly products.
'Negotiators' (British, French and Japanese) know about green issues but
don't alter their behaviour to make room for them.
'Lip-service environmentalists' (no explanation necessary) are types like
Argentines, Italians and Portuguese. Colombians and South Africans are
'passive environmentalists' still deeply into consumerism, no matter how bad
for the environment. Then there are the Brazilians, Nigerians and Indians,
or 'spectators', which means they don't give two hoots.
