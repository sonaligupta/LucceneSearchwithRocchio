predictions

INTEL, the leading maker of computer microprocessor chips, reported strong
fourth-quarter results, bringing revenues and earnings for the year to
record levels and well above analysts' projections.
Dr Andrew Grove, president and chief executive, said: '1991 was an
outstanding year for Intel.' Revenues for the year rose by 22 per cent to
Dollars 4.78bn, up from Dollars 3.92bn in 1990. Net income was Dollars 819m,
or Dollars 3.92 a share, compared with Dollars 650m, or Dollars 3.20.
Fourth-quarter results were strong, with revenue of Dollars 1.21bn, up 15
per cent from Dollars 1.05bn for the same period in 1990.
Net income of Dollars 189m, or 90 cents a share, increased from Dollars
164m, or 80 cents, for the fourth quarter of 1990. Wall Street analysts had
forecast fourth-quarter earnings of about 84 cents a share.
Intel's success, in spite of a decline in semiconductor sales stems from the
popularity of its microprocessor products. Its 486 and 386 microprocessors
form the 'brains' of most personal computers.
For the first time, Intel's international business in 1991 exceeded its US
business.
