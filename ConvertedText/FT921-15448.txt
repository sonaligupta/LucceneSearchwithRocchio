FT  10 JAN 92 / UK Company News: S&P downgrades Ratners


   By JOHN THORNHILL


Standard & Poor's, the US credit agency, yesterday fulfilled its threat by
downgrading Ratners Group's Dollars 250m (Pounds 137m) Auction Market
Preferred Stock (Amps) as the stock market anxiously waited the jewellery
company's trading statement due out today at 2pm, writes John Thornhill.
The agency has cut the rating on Ratners' Amps from BBB to B and is keeping
the shares on its Creditwatch list, meaning the rating may either be lowered
or raised depending on future developments. S&P is soon to meet the company
to review its financial health.
S&P said: 'The rating reflects the near-term uncertainties relating to the
group's ability to meet the next payments of dividends on the variable-term
preferred shares, which are due on January 15 1992.'
