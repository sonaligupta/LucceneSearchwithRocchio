FT  22 DEC 92 / French troops wound gunmen in Somalia


   By REUTER


   MOGADISHU


FRENCH troops wounded at least three gunmen when they came under attack in
southern Somalia, a French military spokesman said yesterday, Reuter reports
from Mogadishu.
Ten gunmen in a 'technical' battlewagon charged towards the French soldiers'
observation post near the town of Baidoa on Sunday night, Col Jean-Paul
Perruche said. The troops opened fire.
The three Somalis, found with automatic rifles, were taken to hospital, one
with severe stomach wounds. No French soldiers were hurt and the other
gunmen fled.
The clash highlighted continued insecurity in Somalia, where US-led forces
have intervened to keep pillaging gunmen and feuding clan militias away from
food for victims of Africa's worst famine this century.
Relief agencies put pressure on the US military yesterday to extend their
security umbrella to north Mogadishu, nominally controlled by warlord Ali
Mahdi Mohamed.
'It's teeming with AK-47s and with technicals,' Mr Mark Thomas, spokesman
for the UN Children's Fund, said. 'Any military presence at all would help,
as long as it is a show of force. They said it would happen soon but would
give us no definite date.'
US troops who secured Mogadishu port and airport at the start of Operation
Restore Hope on December 9 have escorted food convoys across the Green Line
dividing the capital, but do not operate patrols in the north. Relief
agencies have withdrawn almost all foreign staff from the enclave because of
the insecurity.
US Marines and their coalition allies have set up bridgeheads for the relief
operation in Baidoa and at a military airfield in Bali Dogle. On Sunday they
entered the southern port of Kismayu.
