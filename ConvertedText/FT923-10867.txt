FT  28 JUL 92 / Interest shown in Land Travel data


   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER


ABOUT 20 companies have expressed an interest in buying the customer
database of Land Travel, the Bath-based coach operator which collapsed last
week.
Mr Robert Buller of liquidator Grant Thornton said yesterday that most of
the potential purchasers were travel companies experiencing a difficult
season.
Sale of the database would not provide funds to compensate the estimated
50,000 people who booked holidays with Land Travel or the 2,500 who had
their holidays cut short, he said.
Any funds obtained from the sale would go towards paying the cost of the
liquidation.
