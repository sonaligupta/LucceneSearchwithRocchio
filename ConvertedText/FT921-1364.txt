FT  24 MAR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar drifts lower


THE DOLLAR drifted a pfennig lower to DM1.6650/60 yesterday on
disappointment from the market that it could not make more of recent figures
showing US economic improvement, and the currency was unable to sustain a
break above DM1.68.
In Tokyo it ended higher in listless Asian trade at Y134.20. Dealings were
pared to a minimum due to lack of fresh incentives, dealers said.
Customers were virtually absent and dealers said the dollar is likely to
enter a consolidation phase, particularly against the yen, until a clearer
direction emerges.
Market participants said long-term sentiment remains bullish, but some
market bulls are turning cautious as the US currency appears to be unable to
breach key technical resistance at DM1.68 and Y135.
The pound stood up well in the wake of worse than expected UK February trade
figures and a bad showing for the Conservatives in the weekend opinion
polls.
Dealers remained bewildered by the British currency's firmness, saying the
only reasons they could give were the shake-out in the dollar and concern
from Federal Reserve officials that hopes of a US recovery could fade.
Dealers at Barclays Bank suggested the firmness of sterling was helped by
comment from a Bundesbank council member on money supply which helped the
D-Mark and knocked the dollar slightly.
'It has been a bit confused today,' said Mr David Cocker, treasury adviser
with Chemical Bank. 'It was a fairly quiet day with no data of any note.'
German M3 money supply grew by 8.6 per cent in February, after January's 9
per cent increase, on the back of strong demand for credit, the president of
the regional central bank in the state of Lower Saxony said.
Mr Helmut Hesse, who also sits in the Bundesbank central policy-making
council, told reporters that this M3 growth trend would not permit any
reductions in official German interest rates.
Bundesbank deputy president Mr Hans Tietmeyer also drew attention to M3
money supply, saving he did not see the strong decline in growth needed to
change monetary policy.
The growth contrasted with expectations in the market of around 8 per cent,
and the Bundesbank's 1992 growth target of 3.5 to 5.5 per cent.
The pound was on its floor within the ERM, but against the D-Mark it moved
between a  1/2 and  3/4 of a pfennig better to DM2.8655 from DM2.8591. It
ended more than a cent higher at Dollars 1.7170 against the dollar, and in
New York it finished at Dollars 1.7190.
Against the Swiss franc, the US currency weakened to SFr1.5185, from
SFr1.5250, and for the French franc, it dipped to FFr5.6625 from FFr5.7025.
