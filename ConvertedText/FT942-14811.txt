FT  19 APR 94 / Healthcare rationing under fire


Moves to make district health authorities responsible for rationing hospital
treatment are likely to be politically unacceptable, the Office of Health
Economics said yesterday.
The health think-tank said people would see local variations in health care
as inconsistent with the concept of the National Health Service.
Author Mr William Laing said the government may be forced to set national
standards spelling out access to certain medical treatments. This would mean
acknowledging rationing of healthcare - 'which they have been unwilling to
do in the past'.
He said the NHS would face a 'crisis of legitimacy' as unelected district
health authorities took decisions.
One possible solution was to allow GP fundholders - who were accountable to
their patients - to buy a wider range of treatments. Alternatively, he said,
authorities should be locally elected.
