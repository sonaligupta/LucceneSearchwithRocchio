FT  23 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Sketchley flat at Pounds 3m but reinstates
interim


   By PEGGY HOLLINGER


SKETCHLEY, the textile rental and dry cleaning group which was on the brink
of collapse two years ago, reported virtually flat profits of Pounds 3.1m
for the 27 weeks to October 2.
The pre-tax result, which compared with Pounds 3.18m for the 26 weeks to
September 27 1991, was helped by a 59 per cent fall in interest charges to
Pounds 625,000 (Pounds 1.51m). Sales were Pounds 1m lower at Pounds 53.7m.
An interim dividend of 1p is declared. Last year's interim was passed.
Earnings per share rose from 4.1p to 4.2p.
The government's climbdown on the immediate closure of 31 pits was welcome
news at Sketchley, which supplies workwear for British Coal's 44,705 miners.
However, the group said the 10 pits earmarked for closure would have little
effect on full-year profits.
Sketchley had been budgeting for a steady decline in the number of miners
since 1990, when there were about 90,000. This year, the group had counted
on less than 45,000 miners and a further decline next year. If the
government's initial plans had been carried out, there would have been about
14,000 miners after the closures.
Mr Tony Bloom, joint deputy chairman of the management team brought in two
years ago to rescue the ailing group, said Sketchley was ready to hit the
acquisition trail. However, it had been more difficult than expected to find
suitable purchases.
During the six months, Sketchley continued to bolster the balance sheet,
with gearing falling from 31 to 22 per cent. The group aimed to reduce this
to between 15 and 18 per cent by the year-end.
Trading had been difficult in the six months, with the dry-cleaning business
suffering declines in both sales and profits.
Mr Bloom said the difference between a good and a bad year came to just
three customers per shop per day. There was little other than economic
upturn which could entice those customers in, he said.
Textile rentals actually increased profits, and Mr Bloom said the outlook
continued to be good. Several larger contracts had been won, including
supplying J Sainsbury and Unigate.
COMMENT
The writing may have been on the wall for British mining, but at least
Sketchley read it in time. The new contracts go a long way to meeting the
loss of coal business. Analysts guess that Sainsbury's alone could represent
Pounds 13m in sales over three years. Then there is Unigate, with an
estimated 10,000 workers ready to don the Sketchley gear. But the best news
yesterday might well have been the dividend. Although the company resumed
pay-outs at the end of last year, the interim declaration offers good hope
for a maintained final at the very least. The one big cloud hanging over
this vastly changed company is the highly uncertain litigation with
Eurocopy, which could run to claims of more than Pounds 9m. That shadow is
not likely to disappear for at least three years. However, as a recovery
play, Sketchley could have some attractions. Forecasts of about Pounds 5.5m
this year leave the group on a prospective p/e of about 13 times.
