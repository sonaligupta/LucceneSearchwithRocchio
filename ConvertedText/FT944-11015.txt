FT  08 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Kenwood rights to fund Pounds 22m Italian
purchase


   By RICHARD WOLFFE


Kenwood Appliances, the household appliances producer, yesterday accompanied
its interim results with a rights issue to fund the Pounds 22m acquisition
of an Italian manufacturer.
The 1-for-4 rights issue, priced at 310p, is expected to raise a net Pounds
27.3m. This will finance the acquisition of Ariete, a Florence-based
producer and distributor of household appliances, as well as funding product
development. Kenwood's share price fell 14p to 360p yesterday,
Mr Tim Parker, chief executive, said: 'Ariete has a complementary range of
products and an established position in the Italian market. The
opportunities for growth in international markets with Ariete's existing
product range and new ranges under development will be substantial.'
Ariete's main products include coffee-making machines and steam irons. Some
Kenwood products will be branded under the Ariete name in Italy, as Kenwood
hopes to exploit Ariete's distribution network in the Mediterranean area.
In 1993 Ariete reported pre-tax profits of L6.6bn (Pounds 2.6m) on turnover
of L57.4bn. Sales increased 34 per cent in the nine months to September 30.
Kenwood has agreed to pay L46bn in cash and an additional L3bn based on
Ariete's pre-tax profits for the year to December 31. The owners, who are
mainly private shareholders, have also retained the right to a dividend for
the year.
The deal, which is subject to a maximum of L70.6bn, is conditional on
approval from the Italian anti-trust authority. Completion is expected by
December 7.
Ariete is the latest in a series of acquisitions which fit into Kenwood's
strategy of international expansion.
In October last year the group paid Pounds 4m for Precision Engineering,
including its Waymaster subsidiary which manufactures water filters and
kitchen scales. Two years ago, it spent Pounds 3.9m on Tricom, the Hong Kong
company which produces small kitchen appliances in southern China.
Waymaster's contribution helped to lift Kenwood's pre-tax profits 12 per
cent to Pounds 6.01m (Pounds 5.35m) during the six months to September 30.
Turnover rose 10 per cent to Pounds 60.4m (Pounds 55m), despite lower
like-for-like sales in the UK.
Interest costs increased from Pounds 364,000 to Pounds 646,000. Gearing,
which rose from 19 to 46 per cent at the half-year stage, is expected to
fall to 25 per cent by the end of the year, ignoring the Ariete acquisition.
Earnings per share rose to 11.3p (9.6p) and the board proposed an interim
dividend of 3.25p (3p).
The company floated in June 1992 with a placing price of 285p.
