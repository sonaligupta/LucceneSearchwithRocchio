FT  13 APR 92 / Australia's main parties defeated in by-election

AUSTRALIA's mainstream political parties suffered a sharp defeat in a
by-election on Saturday to fill the seat vacated by Mr Bob Hawke, the former
prime minister.
More than 30 per cent of the electorate in Wills, a working-class district
of Melbourne, registered their anger over unemployment by voting for Mr Phil
Cleary, an independent candidate and local football hero.
The result was a disaster for the ruling Labor party. Wills has
traditionally been a safe Labor seat but in Saturday's election the party's
share of support fell by 20 per cent compared with the last election two
years ago.
This was despite heavy campaigning by Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister.
Labor officials have conceded the prolonged recession and high unemployment
in the area led to the party's defeat.
Wills has the highest unemployment rate in Victoria, the state which itself
has the highest jobless level in the country.
Almost 20,000 are unemployed out of a total population of about 140,000.
The result also delivered a big blow to the Liberal party's hopes of
becoming an acceptable alternative to Labour. While the party suffered only
a 7 per cent fall in its primary vote, it failed to pick up the protest vote
against Labor.
