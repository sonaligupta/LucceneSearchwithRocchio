FT  29 JAN 92 / Observer: On board


After four years of trying, the Norwegian corporate predator Torstein Hagen
has finally been offered a seat on the eight-strong supervisory board of
Nedlloyd, the poorly performing Dutch transportation group. As Hagen claims
to speak for over a quarter of Nedlloyd's equity, the event is scarcely a
victory for shareholder democracy.
Hagen has had to make several concessions. He has got fewer board seats than
he wanted. Moreover Nedlloyd says that despite his appointment, which still
has to be agreed by its employees' council, there will be no change in its
strategy, structure, or articles of incorporation. So it is hard to see how
he could push through any radical reshaping of the group.
Whether investors in Hagen's own Marine Investments company will take as
patient an attitude, is another question. They are unlikely to be prepared
to wait much longer for a decent return on their highly illiquid stake in
Nedlloyd.
