FT  02 JUL 92 / Thousands turn out for funeral of murdered Algerian
president

   ALGIERS


TENS of thousands of Algerians took to the streets yesterday to mourn their
murdered head of state, Mr Mohammed Boudiaf, write William Dawkins and
Francis Ghiles in Algiers.
A grief-stricken crowd gathered outside the presidential palace as mourners
filed past Mr Boudiaf's coffin in the hours before his funeral at Algiers'
main mosque. Women ululated as a green army truck bearing Mr Boudiaf's
coffin left the gates to move slowly towards the Djema Khebir mosque.
Some demonstrators blamed the recently banned fundamentalist Islamic
Salvation Front (FIS) for Mr Boudiaf's assassination on Monday.
Others in the crowd chanted: 'Chadli assassin', accusing former President
Chadli Bendjedid, forced out of office in January. This echoed Algerian
press reports that the killing might have been organised by senior
politicians with much to fear from Mr Boudiaf's crusade against corruption.
The poor central area of the Casbah was almost deserted and shops pulled
down their steel shutters in respect.
Four hours later, the official news agency APS said the killer, whom it did
not name, was a sub-lieutenant in the country's counter-espionage unit. He
was on security duty to protect Mr Boudiaf, APS said. It gave no indication
whether was a Moslem fundamentalist or had other motives.
