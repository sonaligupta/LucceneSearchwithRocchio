FT  27 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Palma


Increased interest payable and exceptional charges related to the carrying
costs of leasehold properties pushed Palma Group, the Leicester-based
knitwear company, further into the red in the six months to July 26.
At the operating level, profits improved to Pounds 326,000 (Pounds 243,000),
but the charge of Pounds 215,000 against the company's former retail chain
of seven properties and interest payable of Pounds 516,000 (Pounds 423,000)
saw the pre-tax deficit deepen to Pounds 405,000 (Pounds 180,000).
Mr Peter Bailey, chairman, said that the high level of short-term borrowing
should fall as trading improved. However trading since the period-end had
been 'disappointing'.
Turnover fell to Pounds 6.41m (Pounds 7.84m) reflecting rationalisation.
Losses per share worked through at 2.12p (0.95p). The interim dividend is
again passed and there will be no final distribution.
