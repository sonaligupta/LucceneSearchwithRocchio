FT  30 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: No sane way to generate jobs


   From Mr CLAUDE ROESSIGER


Sir, It is impossible not to comment on EC social affairs commissioner
Padraig Flynn's prescription that hours of work be reduced to generate
employment ('EC plans 5 per cent jobless target', October 20). This is new
Euro-madness - that the pie can be divided into smaller pieces leaving each
with as much to eat.
The only way to increase employment is to increase productivity, thereby
increasing wealth. It is either that or Pharaoh building pyramids (that is,
the insanely ponderous governments of developed nations today). But that is
slave labour in a managed economy - which generates neither wealth nor
happiness.
