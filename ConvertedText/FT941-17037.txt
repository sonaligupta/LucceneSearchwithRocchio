FT  06 JAN 94 / International Company News: Aerospatiale shortfall less than
year before

Aerospatiale, the French aircraft and missile group, said yesterday its
losses last year were 'significantly' less than in 1992, but it warned it
could not hope to turn in an overall profit until 1995.
Mr Louis Gallois, chairman, claimed that in the current downturn in many
aerospace and defence sectors the group had done well to limit the fall in
turnover to 5 per cent, from FFr51.9bn (Dollars 8.8bn) in 1992 to FFr49.3bn.
It had also reduced indebtedness by FFr1.5bn through cuts in investment,
lower interest rates and a lease-back operation.
But Mr Gallois was pessimistic about the near future. Last year orders fell
sharply to FFr29bn, from the FFr39bn level booked in 1992, mainly due to the
depressed market for aircraft carrying more than 100 passengers and
depressed demand for civil helicopters.
'We have hit the bottom of the swimming pool,' he said, but he could see no
sign of a recovery before 1996-1997.
The military and space business had done better last year, with Aerospatiale
winning Turkish and Dutch orders for the military helicopters it makes in
its Eurocopter joint venture with Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) and selling more
missiles, Mr Gallois claimed, than any other European company.
It was continuing negotiations with Dasa to form joint ventures in missiles
and space equipment, along the lines of Eurocopter.
Aerospatiale, which lost FFr2.38bn in 1992 and FFr870m in the first half of
last year, is on the Balladur government's privatisation list, but Mr
Gallois acknowledged it was 'impossible to privatise a company with the sort
of balance sheet that Aerospatiale has at present'.
However, it was possible the government might soon allow other companies to
take a limited stake. Possible candidates include French companies such as
Alcatel and the Lagardere group, or indeed Dasa itself.
