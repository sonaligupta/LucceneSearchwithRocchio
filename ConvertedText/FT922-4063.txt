FT  08 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: UK economy


As the UK market gropes in vain for signs of an upturn in consumer spending,
a disquieting thought occurs. The UK government is squaring up to a
particularly grim public spending round. One consequence is bound to be
further job losses in the public sector. A decade ago, the old concept of a
job for life was abolished for steelworkers and miners. It then started to
die for bank clerks and telephone operators. It is now dying for civil
servants, teachers and hospital workers. In the long run, this may prove
beneficial in breaking down traditional rigidities in the UK labour market.
But its transitional effect on consumer confidence looks decidedly awkward.
At a time when the population has grasped that house price inflation is a
thing of the past, who is there left with a safe enough job to risk a big
mortgage?
