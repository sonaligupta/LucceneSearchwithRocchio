FT  21 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Restructured Mosaic returns to the black
with Pounds 1m


   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY


Mosaic Investments, the licensing and design, display products and
specialist packaging group, returned to the black with pre-tax profits of
Pounds 1m for the year to April 30, writes Caroline Southey.
Last time there were losses of Pounds 14.8m, restated for FRS 3.
The company also announced the separate listing of Copyright Promotions
Group, its wholly owned subsidiary in which it will retain a 30 per cent
holding.
Mosaic's sales fell from Pounds 31.2m to Pounds 21.4m, although turnover
from continuing operations rose marginally to Pounds 20.4m (Pounds 20m).
Operating profits were Pounds 1.51m (Pounds 1.47m), including losses of
Pounds 100,000 (Pounds 460,000) from discontinued activities. The pre-tax
result last time was after exceptional restructuring charges of Pounds
15.4m.
Mr David Williams, founder and chairman, who returned to Mosaic in February
after leaving in 1991 following boardroom disagreements, said the results
'demonstrated that Mosaic has returned to a position of financial
stability'.
He said the flotation of CPG was the beginning of his strategy to refocus
the company and shareholders should expect the process to continue.
Mosaic's shares were suspended between September 1992 and May 1993 because
it could not raise sufficient funds to redeem a preference share issue.
Mr Williams said the relisting had been achieved by the disposal of
lossmaking activities, the arrangement of new banking facilities to provide
adequate working capital and the settlement of obligations relating to
deferred consideration.
A further boost came from Montagu Private Equity Investments subscribing to
a preference share issue in February.
Earnings per share were 0.78p (91.42p losses). There is again no dividend.
