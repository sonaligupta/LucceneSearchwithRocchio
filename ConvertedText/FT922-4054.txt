FT  08 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Norweb expands retailing with Pounds 5m buy


   By JOHN THORNHILL


NORWEB, the Manchester-based electricity company, is significantly expanding
its retailing activities through the acquisition of 20 Atlantis electrical
superstores from Thorn EMI for Pounds 5m in cash.
The acquisition of the Atlantis stores will double Norweb's retail floor
space to 230,000 sq ft and give it access to retail parks in the north of
England and the Midlands.
Earlier this year, Thorn EMI decided to withdraw from its loss-making
electrical retailing activities, which had lost Pounds 50m over the previous
three years. Thorn said it would convert most of its 450-store Rumbelows
chain to rental outlets and would consider selling its 45-store Atlantis
chain.
