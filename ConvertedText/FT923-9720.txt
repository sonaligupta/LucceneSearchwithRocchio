FT  04 AUG 92 / Radioactive waste protests halt court

   KUALA LUMPUR


AN APPEAL to the Malaysian Supreme Court brought by a Japanese-controlled
company found guilty of emitting quantities of radioactive waste was
abandoned yesterday amid chaotic scenes outside the court buildings.
The Asian Rare Earth company, 35 per cent owned by the Mitsubishi-Kasei
group, Japan's largest chemical company, had lodged an appeal against an
earlier court ruling to cease production at its plant near Ipoh, in northern
Malaysia.
But proceedings at the supreme court were adjourned after about 2,000
protesters from Ipoh arrived outside the court buildings. Riot police
prevented them from entering the court complex.
Asian Rare Earth produces minerals used in making electronic components.
Last month the Ipoh High Court had found there was enough evidence to show
that the health of local residents had been threatened by emissions from the
Asian Rare Earth factory, with a growing number of cases of leukaemia,
infant deaths and congenital diseases reported in the surrounding area.
The factory had been ordered to shut down within two weeks, though no
compensation was paid as the judge found that negligence by the company had
not been proven.
Soon after the Ipoh court ruling local residents were angered when Asian
Rare Earth succeeded in getting an interim stay of execution on the closure
order from the Supreme Court. Yesterday's hearing was to decide on the
validity of the original Ipoh High Court verdict.
While local residents have been involved in a lengthy campaign against Asian
Rare Earth's activities, the issue has not received much publicity in
Malaysia as a whole.
In Japan, however, several environmental groups have seized on the issue as
showing that Japan is exporting its polluting industries overseas.
The Supreme Court hearing of the case is now scheduled for tomorrow.
