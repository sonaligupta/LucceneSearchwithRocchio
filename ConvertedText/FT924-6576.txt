CAMPBELL SOUP, the US food company which is embroiled in a takeover bid for
Arnotts, the Australian cookie and cracker group, yesterday reported a 21
per cent increase in first-quarter profits, at Dollars 156.6m after tax.
The improvement was scored on sales up by 10 per cent overall, at Dollars
1.7bn, and translated into earnings per share of 62 cents, compared with 51
cents in the same period of last year.
Mr David Johnson, Campbell's chief executive, claimed the advance reflected
a push for markets and increased market shares, with advertising expenditure
increasing by 24 per cent.
In its core North and South America markets, Campbell saw a 9 per cent sales
increase, with a 15 per cent improvement in earnings, and in the much
smaller Europe/Asia division, the gains were 16 per cent and 28 per cent
respectively.
However, although sales in the biscuit and bakery arm advanced by 8 per
cent, profits fell by 11 per cent.
Campbell said sales of its Pepperidge Farm premium cookies remained soft,
because of the recession, and that the earnings dip reflected higher
marketing spending on new Pepperidge Farm and Delacre products.
