FT  12 MAR 93 / Letter: Quality needs a more rigorous standard (1)


   From Dr MIKE ASHER


Sir, Charles Batchelor ('Need a quality certificate? Ask Tom, Dick or
Harry', March 8) rightly expresses a loophole in quality management system
accreditation which, if the long term success of BS 5750 is to be assured,
the government must move to seal.
The growth in National Accreditation Council for Certification Bodies to 24
has led to much needed competition in the market. The downside has been the
increase of cowboy companies seeking to profit from the ignorance of the
market. These companies are telling clients that they will sell them
consultancy and then give them BS 5750.
The government must act now to prevent non-NACCB bodies awarding BS 5750.
Only this will secure the future of one of the success stories of the
Department of Trade and Industry Enterprise Initiative.
