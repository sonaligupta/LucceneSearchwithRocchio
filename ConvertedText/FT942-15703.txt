FT  14 APR 94 / Ofgas leader retracts claim


   By ROBERT CORZINE


Ms Clare Spottiswoode, director-general of Ofgas, the gas industry
regulator, has withdrawn an allegation that her predecessor acted
'illegally' in allowing the costs of energy efficiency projects to be passed
to consumers.
In an appearance last month before the Commons environment committee, Ms
Spottiswoode made clear that she believed Sir James McKinnon, her
predecessor at Ofgas, had exceeded his authority in approving certain
conservation programmes.
She had earlier told the Commons trade and industry committee that consumer
funding of so-called 'E factor' schemes was tantamount to a tax, therefore
outside her powers.
But in a letter to the environment committee, published yesterday, Ms
Spottiswoode says: 'On further reflection I believe that the 'E' factor
expenditure authorised by my predecessor falls within the Director General's
powers of discretion and is therefore not unlawful.'
The controversy centres on whether customers should pay for savings
projects.
