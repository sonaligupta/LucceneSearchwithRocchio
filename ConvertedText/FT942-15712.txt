FT  14 APR 94 / Byatt rejects allegations on appointments


   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent


Mr Ian Byatt, director-general of Ofwat, the water industry regulator,
yesterday rejected allegations that he had appointed friends and business
contacts to head Ofwat regional customer service committees, which represent
customer interests.
He told the Commons environment committee: 'I resent and regard as stupid
the accusation that I give jobs to my friends.'
Pressed by Ms Helen Jackson, Labour MP for Sheffield Hillsborough, Mr Byatt
said that his decision in February not to reappoint Ms Diana Scott, who had
chaired the Yorkshire customer committee, was 'categorically nothing to do
with metering'. Ms Scott, unlike Mr Byatt, was critical of water company
plans to extend household metering.
Mr Byatt added: 'I think that her (Ms Scott's) work in Yorkshire has been
comparatively more powerful than her work on the group (of Ofwat committee
chairmen) - but that is all I will say about it.'
The committee expressed its concern that household water bills will continue
to rise faster than inflation to pay for quality improvements, including
compliance with new environmental regulations. Next month Ofwat will tell
the companies the rate at which it will allow them to raise prices between
1995 and 2005.
Mr Byatt said that he wanted overall rates of return to fall by more than
half in the next decade, although he was not going to claw back historic
profits. According to Ofwat, water companies have been earning 13 per cent
return on capital, defined by Ofwat as their stock market value when they
were floated in 1989 plus investment spending since then.
