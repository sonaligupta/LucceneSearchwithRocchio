FT  22 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: The lessons to be learnt from the
gilts fiasco - A look at what happened, and why


   By PHILIP COGGAN


Gilt-edged securities often are touted as a 'safe' choice for private
investors. After all, what could be more secure than an investment
guaranteed by the government, paying a fixed income and having a fixed
repayment value?
Those private investors who bought the safety argument for gilts late in
1993 will be laughing hollowly, however. Since January 3, the FT government
securities index has dropped from 107.6 to 91.3, while yields on medium-term
gilts have risen from 6.1 per cent to 8.64 per cent. The total return on
seven to 10-year gilts over the year to October 17 was - 8.07 per cent,
according to Lehman Brothers, and that is before taking account of tax.
The news is not all bad. Investors will realise their loss only if they sell
their gilt holdings at today's prices. Indeed, one of the advantages of
gilts is that, if you hold them until maturity, you are absolutely sure of
your nominal return; those who bought at the start of the year will still
earn 6.1 per cent if they hold on.
This is, however, small comfort; after all, investors could have kept their
money in the building society for the past 10 months, earning a positive
return. But should the falls in bond prices discourage private investors
from holding gilts, or should they see it as a buying opportunity? Returns
on the 10-year gilt, at 8.63 per cent, are still well above those on offer
from a building society.
Many economists argued at the start of 1994 that the 'fundamentals' were
favourable for gilts; in their view, UK inflation was not set to accelerate
and the government was getting its budget deficit under control. So far,
such analysis has been proved right - but the economists' conclusions have
been completely wrong. Gilt investors have had a painful lesson about the
global scale of the bond market.
To understand what has happened to gilts this year, you must look across the
Atlantic. On February 4, the US Federal Reserve increased interest rates
from 3 to 3.25 per cent. The change might have been small in scale but its
effect on sentiment was enormous.
For much of the 1990s, the Fed had been operating a deliberate policy of low
interest rates - both to encourage the US economy to climb out of recession
and to re-build the finances of the US banking system, which were weakened
severely in the debt binge of the late 1980s. Low interest rates let the
banks borrow cheaply and invest the proceeds in higher-yielding bonds.
Banks were not the only ones to spot the profitability of this strategy.
'Hedge' funds, which speculate with borrowed money, also got into the act.
And private investors, dissatisfied at the low rates payable on deposits,
poured money into bond and equity funds.
In the UK and Europe, interest rates also fell early in the 1990s in
response to recession. The same switch of funds from cash to bonds and
equities occurred in the European financial markets, and was reinforced by
US investors looking to diversify overseas. The result was a speculative
bubble which drove the yield on the 30-year US Treasury bond down to 5.78
per cent in October 1993, its lowest level for a generation.
Although the bond market had started to weaken before the increase in US
rates in February, the change in Fed policy proved a watershed. The initial
rise in bond yields meant that those who had been speculating with borrowed
money on ever-falling yields had to move quickly to cut their losses.
Then, too, the Fed move coincided with signs that the European economies
were recovering faster than expected. Inflation, regarded previously as
yesterday's problem, suddenly became seen as tomorrow's danger.
The turn in the bond markets also revealed a more fundamental problem.
Governments round the world had entered the recession with their finances in
an unsatisfactory state; the economic downturn made things worse by cutting
tax revenues and boosting spending on social services. As a result, more
bonds were issued.
While speculators were supporting the market, there was plenty of demand to
meet this extra supply. But Robin Aspinall, analyst at broker Panmure
Gordon, says the problems have come home to roost. 'Last year, an abundance
of liquidity released from (mostly US) cash inundated the bond markets of
the world, delaying and disguising the impact of higher public sector debt
issuance,' he says.
'The heritage of that has been a twin problem: the shock of re-discovering
that supply still matters, combined with the hangover left following the
over-enthusiastic participation in last year's bull run.'
All this had an exaggerated impact on the UK. Investors reasoned that if
inflation was set to return with a vengeance, Britain probably would be
among the victims, partly because of its poor historical record and partly
because its recovery was further advanced than that of its fellow European
countries.
The UK did not help its cause by cutting base rates just four days after the
Fed's first increase. The cut, seen as badly-timed, cast doubts on the
government's will to bring down inflation within the lower half of its 1-4
per cent target range.
Yet, after a long period of both relative and absolute weakness, gilts have
started to revive recently. Markets accepted the argument that the
government's increase in base rates - from 5.25 to 5.75 per cent - was a
pre-emptive strike against inflation. Confidence in the government's new
monetary regime, which places a greater emphasis on the role of the Bank of
England, was in large part restored.
Furthermore, the government is taking action to reduce its budget deficit.
And while the public sector borrowing requirement is forecast to be Pounds
30bn to Pounds 34bn this year, Britain's finances still look a lot healthier
than those of other European countries such as Belgium, Italy and Sweden.
This economic recovery shows genuine signs of being different from its
recent predecessors. Monthly inflation numbers have been consistently below
forecast, culminating in the fall in underlying inflation to 2 per cent in
September, the lowest for 27 years.
And, far from deteriorating, Britain's trade position has been improving
steadily this year. Indeed, Nigel Richardson, head of bond research at
Yamaichi International Europe, thinks the UK is going to be one of the
best-performing bond markets of the next 12 months.
Certainly, at 8.63 per cent, anyone buying the 10-year gilt is getting a
yield which is more than six percentage points higher than the September
inflation figure.
Most economists think inflation will start to rise from now on, but they
differ on whether it will stay within the government's 1-4 per cent target
range. But if you are an income-seeking investor and believe the government
can achieve its target, this seems as good a time to buy gilts as any.
It might be a different story if you are employed and do not need current
income. Since gilts pay most of their return as income, they are not very
tax-efficient, especially for top-rate taxpayers. Any gilt priced above 100
will pay a high income but, if held to maturity, will involve investors in a
capital loss which cannot be offset, for CGT purposes, against gains
elsewhere.
Index-linked gilts are an alternative option for investors seeking capital
gains. Both the maturity value and the interest on such gilts rise in line
with the retail prices index.
But the annual income is quite small - normally, 2 or 2.5 per cent - which
means that the bulk of the return comes in the form of capital gain. Since
this is tax-free, index-linked gilts may appeal to top-rate taxpayers.
Real yields on index-linked gilts are around 3.8 per cent, implying a total
return to investors of around 8 per cent if inflation is 4 per cent.

GILT ISSUES - BEST VALUE V TAX STATUS
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Your capital gain on a gilt - a UK government bond - is tax free.
However, you pay tax on the interest. Therefore, gilts which deliver a
higher proportion of their total return as capital gain are more tax
efficient, and - other things being equal - more attractive to
higher rate taxpayers.
