FT  12 NOV 92 / Wales wins more foreign cash


WALES consistently won a greater share of foreign direct investment than any
other part of Britain during the 1980s in terms of jobs created and new
projects, according to a survey by Cardiff Business School.
Scotland came second in terms of jobs and third in terms of projects. The
north of England was third for jobs and second for projects. The south east
of England did particularly badly. Other parts performing poorly included
Yorkshire and Humberside, and the north-west.
Wales, with new arrivals such as Bosch, Brother and Sharp, performed better
for new projects than any other part of Britain throughout the 1980s with
the exception of 1989 when Scotland performed best.
