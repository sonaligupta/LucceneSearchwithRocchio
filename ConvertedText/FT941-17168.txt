FT  06 JAN 94 / Japanese car sales reach five-year low point

Japanese car sales hit a five-year low in 1993 but could show a weak
recovery at the end of this year, the Japan Automobile Dealers' Association
said yesterday.
Mr Yutaka Kume, chairman of Nissan, warned that demand was so weak that
producers would have to make 'strenuous efforts' to curb costs this year.
Japan's 11 motor groups recorded an 8.4 per cent fall in unit sales last
year, to 4.88m vehicles, the third consecutive year of decline, said the
association.
Nissan became the first Japanese carmaker since the war to close a factory
and discounting is becoming common as dealers attempt to attract cautious
customers.
Association officials believe sales could revive slightly, to more than 5m
this year, assuming that the government's economic packages and expected tax
cuts succeed in stimulating demand.
Mr Tatsuro Toyoda, chairman of Toyota, Japan's largest carmaker, recently
predicted that the Japanese market might expand to 5.1m units this year.
Among the top producers, Toyota's sales fell by 7.7 per cent, while Nissan
was down by 8.4 per cent, Mazda was worst hit with a 16.8 per cent decline,
and Honda's sales fell 14.9 per cent.
Exports fell for the eighth year running, partly due to the yen's strength,
but also as a result of the general shift of production out of Japan to
countries with lower production costs.
Nissan's Mr Kume predicted that exports would fall again this year, within
which there would be a steady rise in Japanese car sales to fast-growing
Asian markets.
