FT  28 APR 94 / Russia debates MP's murder


   By LEYLA BOULTON

Russia's parliament, which has not passed a single law since its election
last December, yesterday devoted its energy to a furious debate over the
contract-killing of an MP and former banker. The shooting of Mr Andrei
Ayzderdis at his home on Tuesday night prompted a pledge of swift
retribution from President Boris Yeltsin, who has been trying to persuade
parliamentary parties to sign an agreement today committing them to
political consensus. Mr Ayzderdis was chairman of a little-known bank called
MDK before he was elected to parliament. Conservative deputies, led by Mr
Vladimir Zhirinovsky (left), called for the sacking of Mr Victor Yerin, the
interior minister, claiming that the killing of Mr Ayzderdis, who last week
published a list of 266 alleged mafia bosses, proved the present government
was incapable of fighting crime.
