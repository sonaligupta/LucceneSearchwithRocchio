HKDollars 3.4bn

NEW World Development, the Hong Kong property developer, posted a HKDollars
3.4bn (USDollars 449.3m) profit this year - a 46.5 per cent jump, from
HKDollars 2.36bn, on the previous period.
It attributed the growth to a sharp increase in property development sales,
bolstered by a rise in luxury residential prices in the first half in 1993.
There was also an improvement in the hotel division.
Turnover rose 7 per cent to HKDollars 13.32bn.
The company recommended a final dividend of 62 cents a share, amounting to a
full-year payout of 87 cents, up from 68 cents previously.
New World has put considerable emphasis on its activities in China, where it
has accumulated some 50m square metres of land for development, in addition
to a number of infrastructure projects.
Although profits continue to be dominated by Hong Kong residential property
sales, the company's Chinese investment programme will make a maiden
contribution in the current fiscal year.
The group will complete its first Chinese power station project and two toll
roads in the country. It is also launching the sale of several large
property developments.
New World aims to have up to 25 per cent of its net assets invested in
China.
