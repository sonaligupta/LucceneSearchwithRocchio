FT  12 MAR 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report


   By REUTER


GOLD was fixed yesterday afternoon at Dollars 349 a troy ounce on the London
bullion market. This acted as a drag on sentiment in the white metals, which
are straining to push upwards, dealers said. Gold continues squeezed between
crucial technical support at Dollars 348 and producer selling in the Dollars
351-Dollars 352 area. Chartists pointed to a bullish chart pattern in
SILVER, which currently lacks a speculative trigger for a rally. Thursday's
US retail sales data may be the trigger, they said. 'I'm more optimistic on
silver at the moment. The longer gold stays where it is, the greater chance
there is of silver breaking away,' one dealer said. On the LME ZINC
momentarily dropped to three-week lows in the afternoon on continued
liquidation, with support for three-month metal around Dollars 1,180 a tonne
breached. TIN lost ground against a background of freer offers of Brazilian
metal. In Chicago WHEAT futures were well down at midday, pounded by long
liquidation and commission house selling. 'There were a lot of longs in the
market after the run-up just in case of a hard freeze,' said a trader.
Market talk that crop damage in the High Plains and the Midwest was not as
severe as previously believed contributed to losses, traders said.
