FT  28 JAN 94 / World Trade News: UK-insured exports up by 80%


   By RICHARD LAPPER


The value of exports insured by the Export Credits Guarantee Department, the
UK's national export credit agency, increased to its highest level for
nearly a decade in the 12 months to March 31 last year, signalling a strong
performance by British exporters.
The value of new business insured amounted to Pounds 3.8bn, up 80 per cent
compared both with 1991-92 and the average level since the onset of the debt
crisis in the early 1980s.
Premium income on new business rose sharply, reaching Pounds 133m, 60 per
cent up on 1991-92, while the ECGD's trading surplus increased to Pounds
740m, as an improvement in the economy led to a reduction in provisions and
claims.
Mr Brian Willott, chief executive, said the figures represented a 'dramatic
change around. UK industry has been very successful at increasing its
business, particularly to the Far East'. He said the strong upward trend had
continued into the current financial year.
Four of the five markets in which UK companies were most successful were in
the Far East - Hong Kong, Malaysia, Indonesia and China. The other was the
United Arab Emirates. The value of guarantees involved in the Black Point
power station project in Hong Kong, the biggest single deal covered last
year, amounted to about Pounds 800m.
Mr Willott said the substantial reductions in premium rates and the
increases in cover announced in the 1992 autumn budget gave 'the ECGD and
its customers for the first time a clear three-year growth path'.
The ECGD had benefited from a fall in its provisions, which were reduced to
Pounds 8.49bn compared with Pounds 8.60bn. This partially reflected an
improvement in economic conditions in Latin American and some other heavily
indebted countries. Provisions against Brazil, Mexico and Egypt were all
reduced by between 15 and 20 per cent. Provisions for Cuba, Angola and for
some countries which were formerly part of the Soviet Union were increased
by about 50 per cent.
The agency's trading surplus on its old and new business combined reached
Pounds 740m, up from Pounds 340m. Claims paid fell by 23 per cent to Pounds
739m, compared with Pounds 954m.
