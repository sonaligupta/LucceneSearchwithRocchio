FT  15 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Liquidation likely at Archer arms


   By RALPH ATKINS, Insurance Correspondent


Archer, the Lloyd's agency, expects a liquidator to be appointed to 'a
number of subsidiaries' affected by litigation.
Mr Bryan Kellett, chairman, said the group was regarding as discontinued
four members' agencies and a managing agency hit by court victories by
lossmaking Lloyd's Names - individuals whose assets have traditionally
supported the insurance market.
The agencies were acquired by Archer in recent years but the group is taking
advice on their future.
Archer also announced it had spent Pounds 342,000 on professional fees while
reviewing its future in the light of changes at Lloyd's. A separate company
set up to invest in Archer syndicates has raised about Pounds 4m - lower
than the group had hoped for.
Mr Kellett said continuing businesses made an operating profit in the year.
However, the group anticipates a 12.5 per cent fall in the underwriting
capacity of on-going insurance syndicates under its management in 1995. The
number of syndicates run by Archer will fall from 15 to 12.
Archer also announced a reduced pre-tax deficit of Pounds 240,000 (Pounds
820,000) for the 12 months to September 30. Turnover rose to Pounds 10.7m
(Pounds 8.3m).
Losses per share were 0.9p (1.9p). A recommended final dividend of 0.5p
makes an unchanged total of 1p.
The group still hopes to acquire the members agency business of Cox Group.
