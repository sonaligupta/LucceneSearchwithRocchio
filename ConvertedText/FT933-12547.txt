FT  23 JUL 93 / Observer: Dagger and cloak


Given the inevitable suspicion that MI5's vow to be more open is a
smokescreen, it's reassuring to see some unequivocally cloak and dagger work
in process on the fringes of security operations: in the London-based
International Institute of Strategic Studies.
Why did its Swedish director Bo Huldt leave after only a year? Because his
wife couldn't find a job in London, the institute's council was told this
spring by its chairman, Robert Ellsworth, once President Nixon's
under-secretary for defence.
Really? Well . . . not quite.
It seems that Huldt, who's going back to heading Sweden's institute of
international affairs, was given his marching orders by Ellsworth,
apparently in response not only to complaints from staff, but to a drastic
decline in support from US foundations.
The revelation has nevertheless scarcely pleased the council members, drawn
from the great and the good of the western defence establishment. Hence,
perhaps, their shilly-shallying over Ellsworth's attempts to have Huldt
replaced by the institute's director of studies, John Chipman, a Canadian
who has applied for British nationality.
Thanks to a special council meeting, he is now faced by an external
contender, with the choice to be announced at the institute's September
conference in Brussels.
Whichever of the two ends up getting the dagger, the outsider's identity is
under the cloak. But there's one thing that is known. Since the candidate is
definitely a he, it is not Stella Rimington.
