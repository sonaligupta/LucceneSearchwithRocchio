FT  20 APR 94 / UK Company News: Inchcape Chinese Rolls-Royce deal


Inchcape, the international marketing and services company, has been
appointed Rolls-Royce importer and distributor for China. It plans to
establish dealerships in Beijing, Shanghai and Canton.
Inchcape is to form a new company, Rolls-Royce Motor Cars of China, and is
aiming for gradual growth from the current level of between 30 and 40 sales
a year.
Inchcape has also sold Whetstone Garage to Europe Energy Group for Pounds
1.21m, to be satisfied by Pounds 609,000 cash and the placing of 4.71m new
Europe Energy ordinary shares with institutions. There will be a further
payment of Pounds 500,000 for Whetstone's inventory.
Whetstone will be renamed Millenium Motor Holdings.
It is Europe Energy's first acquisition since Mr Gerald Davison, former
chairman of Keep Trust and managing director of Honda UK, was appointed
chairman and chief executive. He intends to turn the USM-traded group from
an energy company into a vehicle retailer.
