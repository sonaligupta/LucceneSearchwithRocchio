   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff


The extent to which trade union rights are denied across much of the
developing world emerged in a report yesterday which found that 92 trade
unionists were murdered last year in 14 countries.
The annual survey of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions,
published yesterday (FRI), listed 91 countries with poor trade union records
and recorded about 1,000 attacks on trade unionists in 22 countries.
