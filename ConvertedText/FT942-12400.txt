FT  29 APR 94 / UK Company News: US hikers put Hi-Tec back on track


   By DAVID BLACKWELL


The US penchant for hiking boots helped Hi-Tec, the sports and leisure wear
company which is 54 per cent owned by its founder, Mr Frank van Wezel, to
return to the black in the year to January 31.
Pre-tax profits emerged at Pounds 1.13m, compared with an Pounds 8.3m loss
previously. Turnover rose by 18 per cent to Pounds 126.2m (Pounds 106.9m).
The profits were struck after Pounds 2.43m of exceptional items, including
Pounds 442,000 for cost cutting measures in the UK and the Netherlands and
Pounds 437,000 for capital restructuring in the US. However, most of this
was offset by an exceptional tax credit of Pounds 1.68m.
Last time exceptional charges of Pounds 4.82m were incurred through the
closure of the continental European sales network.
North America accounted for most of 1993's profits, making Pounds 5m (Pounds
2.4m) on sales of Pounds 48m (Pounds 29.4m).
Mr Peter Butler, finance director, said the group was well placed to exploit
the nineties trend for 'outdoor' footwear. The company expected this year to
sell 1m pairs of its Sierra Lite hiking boots.
Footwear is now sold through independent distributors in continental Europe,
where turnover fell by Pounds 6m to Pounds 22.2m. Mr Butler said that in
continental Europe the footwear side was breaking even. But sales at Cofex,
which makes fashion jackets, had fallen by 9 per cent, pushing the division
into the red.
The UK and Ireland division made profits of Pounds 1.85m (Pounds 1.58m loss)
on sales of Pounds 40.8m (Pounds 37.5m).
In the rest of the world, turnover rose from Pounds 11.8m to Pounds 15.2m,
helped by the fashion trend to US-style outdoor footwear. Operating profits
were Pounds 900,000 (Pounds 400,000).
Net interest payable rose to Pounds 2.77m (Pounds 2m), giving gearing of 84
per cent (81 per cent).
Earnings were 3.7p (18.8p loss). The final dividend of 1.5p makes a total of
2.75p (2p).
