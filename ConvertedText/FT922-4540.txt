FT  05 JUN 92 / Thurcroft miners propose buyout


   By JULIET SYCHRAVA


REDUNDANT miners from Thurcroft Colliery in South Yorkshire, which closed in
December, will today present British Coal with plans for an employee buyout
to save it.
The proposal follows an employee buyout of Monktonhall colliery in Scotland
last month. If the Thurcroft plan succeeds, it will be seen as confirmation
that colliery buyouts are a realistic option for otherwise doomed pits.
Earlier this month Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, encouraged buyouts by
saying the government would help employees interested in bidding for mines
to fund the cost of preparing their bids.
The miners lost their jobs when Thurcroft closed in December and last month
formed a consortium, backed by Rotherham Borough Council, to rescue the
colliery.
British Coal has agreed to delay mothballing the pit until the middle of
this month and has asked for proposals.
Miners have already pledged about Pounds 150,000 to fund the buyout. The
consortium, which hopes to raise between Pounds 250,000 and Pounds 500,000,
was this week working to raise more from institutional investors.
