FT  01 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Interest earnings help boost Fyffes to
IPounds 12.4m

FYFFES, the UK and Irish fruit and vegetable distributor, reported a 33 per
cent increase in pre-tax profits to IPounds 12.4m (Pounds 11.5m) for the six
months to April 30.
Turnover was ahead 6.5 per cent at IPounds 289m.
Mr Carl McCann, finance director, said, however, that interest earned on its
cash holdings of some IPounds 105m had been the principal factor in the
profits growth. Oversupply of bananas in the European market had held back
growth in trading profits.
Last year's first half results had been adversely affected by the battle
with Chiquita in the US over the sourcing of European-destined bananas from
Honduras. As part of the peace agreement, Fyffes temporarily limited its
purchases in the Honduran market.
Mr McCann said the company's new Central American operation 'is now much
more cost-efficient', but added that it had been adversely affected by low
prices in the European market.
'If we had had last year's prices and this year's cost structure, we would
be looking at much better figures', he said.
The decision last month by the PPI Del Monte administrators to sell the
company off rather than float it had revived expectations of a Fyffes' bid.
Mr McCann declined to comment on whether a fresh approach had been made to
the PPI administrators. But a market analyst said: 'Fyffes' position has
always been that if the price is right, they are interested'.
PPI bought the Del Monte fresh fruit operation for Dollars 875m (Pounds
473m) in 1989 and it is thought that any bids for the company now, following
the decision to abandon a flotation, will be at a substantial discount.
This would still be more than the IPounds 100m on hand to Fyffes and as the
company remains averse to debt-levered acquisitions it is likely that it now
has a partner with which to make a bid.
Earnings per share came out at 2.23p (2.22p), and the interim dividend is
increased to 0.3549p (0.3226p).
The company said that for the full year 'we expect net profit before tax to
show an increase on 1991 although earnings per share are unlikely to be
ahead of last year'.
