FT  16 DEC 94 / International Company News: Highs and lows of forex hedging
 -A strong yen worked for some Japanese groups


   By GERARD BAKER


Corporate casualties of the yen's sharp appreciation in the past five years
are a familiar story. Most of them are manufacturers who have been forced to
cut margins as the prices of their exports have risen strongly.
However, the increasing availability of more sophisticated corporate
treasury operations in the same period has meant that some companies have
been able to offset some of those losses by hedging in the forward foreign
exchange market.
At the same time, many businesses have seen their performance deteriorate as
a result of large losses on the same contracts.
Precisely who were the winners and losers and how big were their gains and
losses was unclear until this autumn, when companies were required for the
first time to disclose in detail their profits on currency hedging. A new
collation of company's results published yesterday by Tokyo Shoko Research,
a private financial research institution, shows the extent to which Japanese
businesses have used this particular derivative instrument, and how varied
the performance has been.
Total gains among companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange neatly
balanced losses. Altogether, 211 companies recorded losses of a combined
Y99.6bn (Dollars 992.1m) in the year to the end of September, as a result of
the yen's rise, while 162 reported gains of Y95.4bn.
Transport companies, especially airlines, proved the biggest losers. Between
them, companies in the transport sector lost more than Y56bn. Other losing
sectors were textiles and steel. Net losses for 15 textile manufacturers
were Y3.4bn, while eight steelmakers lost a net Y2.6bn.
As might be expected, securities companies recorded the largest net gains.
Between them, 12 brokers managed gains of more than Y6bn. Other net gainers
were transport and electrical engineering companies.
The country's two leading airlines both lost heavily as a result of
long-standing contracts to purchase US dollars at exchange rates that were
not realised. Japan Airlines (JAL) suffered the largest loss of any company,
at Y43.9bn, four times as large as the next biggest loser, All Nippon
Airlines (ANA) with losses totalling Y10.7bn.
JAL began hedging the dollar-yen rate in 1985, concluding contracts to buy a
total of Dollars 3.6bn at an exchange rate of Y165.97 to the dollar at a
series of stipulated dates. ANA made arrangements to buy Dollars 798m at an
exchange rate of Y111.85. Both companies' moves were intended to insure them
against a sharp depreciation of the yen in advance of contract payment dates
for the purchases of foreign air-craft.
In fact, the yen rose well above the contracted levels and continued to
rise. At the end of September 1994, the exchange rate stood at Y98.45 to the
dollar.
On the plus side, Nomura Securities registered the largest net profit, at
Y22.9bn, followed by Nippon Telephone and Telegraph at Y18.02bn.
The research organisation's study covered only forward exchange contracts.
Companies are not as yet required to give full details of their other
derivatives gains or losses.
Tokyo Shoko points out that the rapid growth in the use of derivatives in
the past few years makes it harder to tell the true state of a company's
financial operations. 'Future contracts disclosed this time are just a very
small part of off-balance-sheet derivatives dealings,' he says. 'Interest
rate swaps are particularly in the dark, but of growing significance.'
So the scale of most companies' dealings can only be guessed at. There is
little doubt that in Japan, as elsewhere, many companies have suffered
heavily in the past year from their derivatives trading.
The problem was glimpsed last month with the publication of results at Tokyo
Securities, a small stockbroker. Its exchange losses alone totalled Y3.1bn,
but in all the company lost Y32bn, almost a third of shareholders' capital.
The company acknowledged then that the bulk of that loss came from
fixed-interest derivatives trading.
