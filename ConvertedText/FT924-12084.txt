FT  22 OCT 92 / UK Company News: City & Commercial plans reorganisation


City & Commercial Investment Trust is putting forward reorganisation
proposals.
The split capital trust, which invests in the shares of other investment
trusts, is due to be wound up next February.
Shareholders will be offered securities in a new investment and a new unit
trust. Those who opt for the latter will be able to realise their
investments for cash at asset value.
The new investment trust will continue to invest in the shares of other
trusts.
