FT  08 NOV 93 / Shevardnadze in control

THE attempted overthrow of Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the Georgian head of
state, by forces of the former President Zviad Gamsakurdia, appears over
following the fall of the main Gamsakurdia base of Zugdidi at the weekend.
Spokesmen for the Georgian government said that Mr Gamsakurdia with 1,000 of
his followers had fled to the town of Gali, in the neighbouring region of
Abkhazia - already under rebel control and a self-declared independent
state. However, the Abkhazian authorities in Moscow denied the claim.
The revolt against Mr Shevardnadze, launched last month after the Georgian
leader's forces had been forced out of Abkhazia in the west of the country,
resulted in Russian troops being sent to guard supply routes and railways
and in Georgia seeking to join the Russian-dominated Commonwealth of
Independent States to secure assistance.
Mr Givi Lominadze, head of the interim administration in western Georgia,
told the Interfax news agency that a curfew had been imposed in Zugdidi
because rebels were still active in the area.
The Russian assistance has come with strings - including the likely use of
the port of Poti, briefly in Mr Gamsakurdia's hands, by Russian naval
forces. Russian marines landed at Poti last week and have secured the town
while Russian detachments are already stationed in the port of Adjaria.
