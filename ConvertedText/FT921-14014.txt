FT  17 JAN 92 / International Company News: JC Penney to report deficit for
the year

J. C. PENNEY, the Dallas-based department and drugstore group which ranks
fourth largest retailer in the US, announced yesterday it would report
fourth-quarter and full-year losses in the 12 months to January 25 after
taking a one-off Dollars 695m charge before tax.
The charge covers items ranging from a Dollars 200m write-down on Penney's
property portfolio to a non-cash charge for future post-retirement
healthcare costs.
The company, which made after-tax profits of Dollars 227m in the first nine
months of the year, a drop of almost 39 per cent, saw its share move Dollars
 3/4 higher to Dollars 54 7/8 on the news.
The largest element in the aggregate charge, Dollars 300m, covers the
provision for future healthcare costs. This is required by a change in US
accounting standards. A further Dollars 200m stems from the decline in
property values. The value of the portfolio after the write-down is some
Dollars 3.4bn.
'Significant declines in the real estate market nationwide and the
unlikelihood that there will be a return to formerly high values have
prompted us to re-evaluate our retail estate portfolio,' said Mr William
Howell, Penney's chairman.
The rest of the charge stems from cost-cutting measures, said to save
Dollars 160m a year before tax, goodwill write-offs and bowing out of some
'experimental' businesses.
Penney said it had been hit by weak consumer spending, pressure on margins
and declining sales.
