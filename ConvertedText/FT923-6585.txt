FT  24 AUG 92 / Azerbaijani jets 'kill 40 in raids'

AZERBAIJANI warplanes bombed the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh at
the weekend, killing dozens of civilians, Russian television said yesterday,
Reuter reports from Moscow.
An evening news report showed people being dragged from the debris of a
refugee hostel it said was destroyed on Saturday when an aircraft dropped
two bombs on the Karabakh capital, Stepanakert. Some 40 people were reported
killed in Saturday's attack by Su-25 planes and 100 wounded. Others died in
a raid yesterday.
A spokesman for the Karabakh Committee, which represents ethnic Armenians in
the enclave, said many more had been killed and injured. Bomb attacks killed
several people in the nearby town of Shusha on Saturday.
'The main victims were old people, women and children. Many of them remain
under the rubble of destroyed buildings, the clearing of which is made more
difficult by the panic which has gripped people,' the Armenian news agency
said. Azerbaijan has made no statement.
More than 2,000 people have been killed in four years of fighting between
the former Soviet republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan. The conflict is
mainly in and around Nagorno-Karabakh, an Armenian-populated enclave within
Azerbaijan. But it has spread to wide areas along the border between the two
Caucasian neighbours, both members of the Commonwealth of Independent States
which replaced the old Soviet Union.
Russian TV showed Azeri aircraft dropping what it said were half-tonne bombs
on Stepanakert. A string of Armenian victories earlier this year succeeded
for a time in driving enemy forces out of Nagorno-Karabakh. But Azerbaijan
has since seized the initiative, regaining a foothold in the territory and
capturing Armenian land. Peace negotiations and several attempted ceasefires
have foundered.
