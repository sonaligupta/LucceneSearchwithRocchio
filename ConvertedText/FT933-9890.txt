FT  06 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Philips gains 4.8 per cent in
Amsterdam


   By Our Markets Staff


AS the fallout from the ERM crisis begins to clear, a number of brokers have
started to set out their thoughts on investment prospects, writes Our
Markets Staff.
Mr Anthony Thomas of Kleinwort Benson commented in the broker's latest
investment handbook that while interest rates outside Germany would fall
sharply in the short term 'we remain cautious on the outlook for growth as
consumer confidence remains very weak in view of widespread fears over
unemployment'.
The broker recommended overweighting France in relation to Germany: the
latter's short-term D-Mark strength and relatively high interest rates will
dash 'hopes of a near-term recovery in activity'.
Merrill Lynch's strategists also followed the interest rate argument, noting
that they would continue a shift towards cyclicals.
However, the broker remained cautious about the prospects for German
cyclicals: 'The competitiveness of German industry is already at a 20-year
low ..and last week's ERM changes are likely to exacerbate this problem'.
AMSTERDAM was occupied with a host of results from Philips, Royal Dutch and
Elsevier. The CBS Tendency index ended the day 0.3 higher at 123.1.
Philips satisfied expectations with a 48 per cent gain in second quarter net
profit, the shares gaining Fl 1.60 to Fl 34.80, but off the day's high of Fl
35.30.
Royal Dutch disappointed a number of analysts and the shares came off Fl
2.10 to Fl 181.20.
Elsevier, which initially rose strongly after announcing its results, fell
back towards the close, the shares ending down Fl 1.10 to Fl 135.70.
KLM was another strong performer, up 50 cents to Fl 34.20.
FRANKFURT took a breather after the last few days, the DAX index edging just
0.14 forward to 1,860.70, having moved between a high of 1,867 and a low of
1,845.
Turnover was DM9.3bn.
Among the movers was Mannesmann, helped by a positive note from Merrill
Lynch which recommended a switch out of Preussag. The broker argued that
while Preussag had outperformed the sector over the past 18 months,
Mannesmann still appeared undervalued on the basis of higher earnings in
1994-95 helped by its efforts to restructure.
Mannesmann added DM5.70 or 1.9 per cent to DM309, and Preussag lost DM1.50
to DM414.
In the car sector Volkswagen gained DM12.50 or 3.5 per cent to DM374 ahead
of today's extraordinary board meeting, while BMW was off DM6 at DM546.50,
in reaction to lower west German car orders.
MILAN saw renewed speculative buying of banking shares, but this was not
enough to contain profit-taking pressure after the market's nine-day run and
the Comit index shed 1.37 to 580.47.
However, the underlying mood remained positive and Mr Marco Ortelli of
brokers Akros Sim in Milan saw no reason, based on fundamentals, why the
market should not rise to the 610 level before it meets further resistance.
In his monthly review, Mr Enrico Ponzone of Kleinwort Benson remained
optimistic for the long term.
'After successfully completing the cost of labour negotiations and
introducing the long awaited electoral reform, the government is now poised
to approve the 1994 budget law. This, together with the latest developments
in the ERM, will lead to further rate cuts in the autumn providing the
market with further momentum,' he said.
Credito Italiano added L168 to L2,766 and BCI was L68 higher at L5,465
following Wednesday's restatement of the government's intention to sell them
swiftly.
However, the recently favoured telecommunications sector came under pressure
in response to renewed concerns about a delay in the privatisation process.
Stet slid L62 to L4,059 while Sip fell L61 to L3,127.
ZURICH was dragged lower by a fall in Nestle and the SMI index gave up 6.2
to 2,424.5.
Nestle shed SFr20 to a year's low of SFr1,017 on heavy profit-taking by US
investors amid a resurgence of concern about the value of its portfolio of
brand names. Analysts have also noted that chart analysis of the share price
indicates that the share has the potential for considerable further downward
adjustment.
Swissair fell SFr23 to SFr750 on worries ahead of half year results, due
today.
PARIS added 13.94 to the CAC-40 index, closing at 2,115.30. Turnover
remained healthy at FFr4bn. Goldman Sachs has recently forecast that the
index will reach 2,650 in a year, and believes that the market is currently
undervalued.
Some profit-taking among individual stocks continued. LVMH lost FFr40 to
FFr4,117 after announcing that it had bought Kenzo, the fashion house, for
some FFr482m.
St Gobain slipped FFr1 to FFr591 ahead of announcing a fall in first half
sales after the close.
STOCKHOLM remained strong, helped by good gains in Astra B, up SKr13 to
SKr154. and Ericsson B, up SKr6 at SKr354.
The Affarsvarlden index added 22.40 or 1.8 per cent to 1,241.50.
