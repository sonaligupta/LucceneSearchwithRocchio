FT  05 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Bond market worries keep Dow
depressed

Wall Street
US SHARE prices posted big declines for the second consecutive day as heavy
selling in the Treasury market pushed long-term interest rates sharply
higher, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 36.89 lower at 3,624.98.
The Standard & Poor's 500 fell 5.53 to 457.49, while the American SE
composite shed 4.17 to 477.53 and the Nasdaq composite, hardest hit by the
selling, retreated 15.69, or 2 per cent, to 757.26. NYSE volume was heavy at
323m shares.
Wednesday's steep declines - the Dow fell 36 points and the Nasdaq composite
12 points, or 1.5 per cent - were prompted primarily by concern about rising
long-term interest rates. The bond market has dropped sharply in recent
days, pushing up longer-dated yields, because fixed-income investors are
worried that resurgent economic growth could eventually lead to higher
inflation and tighter monetary policy.
Those worries were again evident yesterday, with the 30-year bond falling
well over a point and the yield climbing to 6.2 per cent. Higher yields, in
turn, triggered fresh selling of stocks. Investor sentiment was so weak that
the markets ignored the news that jobless claims fell by 10,000 in the final
week of last month.
Banking issues, which have taken a hammering recently because of rising bond
yields, were again lower. Chemical receded Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 37 7/8 ,
Chase Manhattan Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 31 3/8 , Citicorp Dollars  1/2 to
Dollars 34 7/8 and JP Morgan Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 68 1/2 .
Retailers were in varied form following an inconsistent batch of sales data.
Gap Stores, where sales declined slightly last month, fell Dollars 1 7/8 to
Dollars 34 1/8 , and Sears Roebuck firmed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 57 5/8 on
news of stronger same-store sales, while the Limited eased Dollars  1/2 to
Dollars 20 7/8 and JC Penney slipped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 50 1/4 .
Among Dow stocks, the biggest decliners were General Electric, down Dollars
2 3/4 at Dollars 93 5/8 , McDonald's, off Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 54, and
AT&T, Dollars 1 3/8 lower at Dollars 55 1/2 . Some cyclical stocks were also
weaker: Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing lost Dollars 1 at Dollars 103 1/4
and Caterpillar Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 89 7/8 .
On the Nasdaq market, technology shares were mostly lower. Intel dropped
Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 59 and Microsoft Dollars 2 to Dollars 76 1/2 , but
Apple bucked the trend, firming Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 32 1/4 .
Canada
THE Toronto market tumbled in active trading, in line with other major world
markets. The TSE 300 index fell 31.0 to 4,213.7. The index, which had been
steady for most of the session, lost ground in the final two hours of
trading.
Declines led advances by 413 to 379 after volume of 82.4m shares valued at
CDollars 668m. Golds bucked the downward trend, advancing 1.98 per cent as
the bullion price rose USDollars 5 an ounce in New York.
