FT  26 OCT 92 / Inflationary flaw may squander UK competitiveness BY By
Edward Balls


INFLATION is no longer the British government's enemy number one. Its
economic strategy, at least that of the prime minister, will now be
orientated towards reviving economic growth as soon as possible. To many
foreign observers, a volte face on this scale must seem astonishing. At
home, it is all depressingly familiar.
The government is not alone. The very same commentators and newspapers who,
only a few weeks ago, were warning of the grave inflationary dangers of
devaluation, are now arguing that deflation, not inflation, is the problem
and offering multi-point plans to save the nation.
The timing of these about-turns may well prove to be disastrous. The UK
needs a recovery, but an ordinary recovery will not do. Growth will be
sustained only if the economy is first rebalanced through a shift of
resources into the traded goods industries and out of the service sector.
The price of exportable goods must rise relative to the general level of
wages and prices in the whole economy, thereby boosting profit margins for
industry and encouraging investment and exports.
That is why devaluation was necessary. An exchange rate devaluation should
deliver a one-off rise in producer prices relative to wages. But if wage
inflation outstrips the sum of the growth rates of producer prices and
productivity, then the profitability and competitiveness gains will
disappear. Sterling's departure from the exchange rate mechanism and
subsequent depreciation by more than 10 per cent make it even more important
that inflationary expectations remain low.
It is not inevitable that the gains from devaluation must be squandered.
Both the US and Australia had much larger depreciations than Britain in the
mid-1980s: the value of the Australian dollar fell by 35 per cent in the two
years to the end of 1986 and the US dollar fell by 25 per cent, while
sterling fell by a little under 10 per cent.
But these dollar devaluations fed directly into improved competitiveness
rather than higher inflation. Producer prices have grown faster than wages
in the US and Australia: real wages have been falling by between 5 and 10
per cent since 1985 as the top right chart shows. In the UK, by contrast,
real wages have soared - by 26 per cent over the same period - while UK
profit margins remained low by international standards.
Little wonder that both the US and Australia have seen their export sectors
grow while the British traded goods sector remains small and sickly. US
export volumes have grown 22 per cent faster than import volumes since 1985.
Australian exports have grown 16 per cent faster than imports. But UK export
volumes have fallen by 9 per cent relative to import volumes over the same
period.
Why did the US and Australian devaluations succeed? Both countries have
similar financial systems to the UK so the answer cannot be Anglo-Saxon
short-termism. The US is a large country in which trade plays a relatively
small role in the economy and trade unions are weak. But Australia, like the
UK, is a small and open economy in which changes in import prices have a
significant effect on living standards and where trade unions remain
powerful. The difference is that Australia, unlike the UK, has had much less
plant-level bargaining. Instead, a series of national accords, agreements
between the unions and the government over the sustainable rate of wage
inflation, have kept real wage growth under control.
In political terms, the UK strategy seems to make sense. The top right-hand
chart goes a long way to explain why the British government was re-elected
last April while President Bush and Australia's Labor administration are in
danger of losing power. Little wonder that the Australian government is now
encouraging a shift towards enterprise bargaining.
Yet politics is the enemy of progress. Mr Major will be able to offer a
sustainable economic recovery only if he delivers slow real wage growth over
the next few years. But then he would probably lose the next election. That
is the depressing political logic of his U-turn.
