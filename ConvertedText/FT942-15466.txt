FT  15 APR 94 / Lesotho soldiers kill deputy PM

   MASERU


Dissident soldiers shot dead Lesotho's deputy prime minister yesterday and
seized four cabinet ministers in a mutiny apparently over a planned
government probe into the army, according to diplomats, Reuter reports from
Maseru.
'The deputy prime minister, Solemetsi Baholo, is dead. He was shot while
resisting being taken by the soldiers,' one said. In Pretoria, the South
African Foreign Ministry said it was 'appalled by the developments' and
would not recognise any government installed by force.
South Africa said it was reactivating a task group of Zimbabwe, Botswana and
South Africa that had mediated in the January crisis. Mr Pik Botha, South
African foreign minister, said the Lesotho government had sought 'immediate
South African mediation with the Lesotho Defence Force'.
But diplomats said there was no indication a coup was under way in the
mountain kingdom of 1.8m people, which is surrounded by South Africa. The
crisis was rather caused by a mutiny apparently in one section of the army,
they said.
A Lesotho government spokesman said soldiers from the main Makonyane
barracks were holding the four cabinet ministers at their headquarters.
At least five soldiers were killed and 11 people wounded in the January
fighting, which broke out initially over pay and conditions.
