FT  23 APR 93 / Brazil's attention returns to economy

BRAZIL yesterday turned its attention to the expected announcement of
anti-inflation measures, following an overwhelming vote in a plebiscite on
Wednesday to retain a presidential system of government.
The government has said it will make an announcement about economic policy
after a cabinet meeting called by President Itamar Franco for tomorrow.
Officials have advanced few details of the measures, although Mr Eliseu
Resende, finance minister, has been at work on policy since he took over his
portfolio in early March.
The government appears set on reducing the monthly inflation rate from the
27 per cent where it now stands to about 17 per cent by the end of this
year.
Ms Yeda Crusius, planning minister, reiterated in a meeting this week with
business leaders in Sao Paulo that the government is not preparing an
economic shock plan, or price freeze, that would 'break contractual
obligations'.
She told executives to expect a reaffirmation of privatisation plans,
efforts to encourage foreign investment, and moderate increases in spending
on social programmes. One probable measure is that three zeros will be
trimmed from the cruzeiro.
Final referendum results are not expected until this afternoon, but exit
polls confirmed predictions of an easy victory for the pro-presidential
camp.
Fifty-eight per cent of voters opted to maintain the current system, against
26 per cent who wanted a change to a parliamentary system, and 16 per cent
of voters who rejected both options. Voters also showed - by a 71 per cent
to 11 per cent margin - their preference for the republican form of
government over a monarchy.
