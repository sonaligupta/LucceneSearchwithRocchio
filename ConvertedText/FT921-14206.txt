FT  17 JAN 92 / Tokyo store sales in largest fall since 1965

TOKYO department store sales fell 2.4 per cent in December from a year
earlier, the largest fall since 1965, and a sign of easing consumer demand
and of a more general slowing of Japanese economic growth.
Japanese retailers, who regard the Tokyo figures as an important indicator,
said unusually warm weather had caused a decline in winter clothing sales,
but that sharp falls in sales of art works and other luxury items were
clearly linked to the collapse of the financial 'bubble'.
The fall was the steepest recorded by the Japan Department Stores'
Association since it began releasing sales figures in 1965, apart from the
distortions caused by the introduction of a value-added tax in 1989.
Sales of art works and crafts were down 15 per cent on a year earlier, sales
of household items fell 3.5 per cent and clothing sales fell 1.8 per cent.
For the full year, sales rose only 2.4 per cent on 1990, the third lowest
increase since 1965.
Meanwhile, the Japan Iron and Steel Federation yesterday reported that the
country's crude steel production last year totalled 109.6m tons, down 0.6
per cent from 1990.
