FT  22 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Support package agreed for
Russian energy sector

RUSSIA'S HARD-pressed energy enterprises appear to have won massive
government credit to assist them in meeting the demands of the coming
winter. At a meeting with energy industry ministers on Tuesday evening they
also seem effectively to have secured the halting of the privatisation
programme in the oil, gas and coal sectors and further curbs on foreign
investment in their industries.
Mr Alvin Yeriomin, chairman of the parliamentary committee on industry who
attended the meeting, said yesterday that the participants agreed an
expensive package of support for energy - following weeks during which heads
of the enterprises had all complained loudly of being starved of credits and
investment, and warned of collapse by the end of the year. The meeting was
attended by Mr Oleg Soskovets, first deputy prime minister for industry and
energy and Mr Yuri Shafrannik, the energy minister.
Among the issues agreed, according to Mr Yeriomin, were:
The government would settle outstanding debts between the enterprises,
estimated at about six trillion (million, million) roubles (Pounds 3.8bn);
Special government subsidies would be provided for coal and geological
research within the existing budget, amounting to Rbs2 trillion;
Prices would be kept down by agreement between supplier and producer or,
failing this, by 'administrative means' - ie, by government decree;
Low interest credits amounting to Rbs1.8 trillion should be available to the
energy sector by September;
The privatisation of the oil companies should be 'stabilised' - by calling a
halt to the break up of corporations and retaining a controlling parcel of
shares in the hands of the government;
The law on foreign investment should be amended, taking into account the
'specific features' of the fuel and energy complex - with possible
additional conditions attached to future concessions to foreign companies -
probably requiring use of Russian equipment.
The meeting, which took place under the aegis of the Russian parliament and
with the attendance of Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliament's speaker, did
not include a representative of the finance or privatisation ministries -
and thus may still be controversial within the ranks of the government.
However, if approved, it shows the continuing and growing power of the oil
'barons' in dictating terms for an industry that provides some 70 per cent
of hard currency earnings as well as the country's fuel needs.
An attempt by Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian President, to liberalise the
price of coal by a decree last month has effectively been neutralised by an
agreement to raise the coal price only by the level of inflation for the
immediate future. An attempt by the government to establish a special fund
to support mining communities thrown out of work because of pit closures by
increasing value added tax by 3 per cent was rejected by parliament earlier
this week.
Mr Soskovets said last week that the 'price for coal should be set at a
level which avoids a loss of competitiveness in the adjacent branches of
industry' - especially the steel and aluminium industries, now earning
precious hard currency by selling abroad at low prices.
