FT  12 NOV 92 / Observer: Pistol-packing


Observer hears that Matrix Churchill's involvement in retooling Saddam
Hussein's war machine was not confined to supplying high-tech machine tools.
A gold-plated, pearl-handled pistol was ordered from Asprey's, the Queen's
jewellers in New Bond Street, and was dispatched to the then Iraqi minister
of military industry, Hussein Kamel, who is Saddam's cousin and married to
his favourite daughter. Asprey's 'highly decorated' handguns can cost as
much as Pounds 35,000 although a boxed pair of Browning pistols with gold
inlay can be picked up for a mere Pounds 17,000.
Whether Kamel took delivery of the Matrix gift is unclear, but it sounds as
if he already has plenty of pistols.
Crescent Petroleum, which produces oil from an offshore field in the Gulf,
bought him an Asprey's pistol a couple of years ago. It reached Baghdad
airport just before the invasion of Kuwait.
