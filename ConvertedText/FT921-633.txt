FT  27 MAR 92 / Write-offs leave CSI Pounds 35m in loss


CANNON Street Investments, the mini-conglomerate, ran up a loss of Pounds
34.9m pre-tax for 1991 of which Pounds 34.5m related to an exceptional
charge to cover asset write-downs and restructuring costs.
For 1990, the company returned pre-tax profits of Pounds 17.3m.
As forewarned in December the final dividend is omitted leaving shareholders
with 3.3p for the year - for 1990 they received 8.8p in total.
Mr Robin Binks, who replaced Mr William Hislop as chief executive, said
group borrowings had been reduced by Pounds 50m to Pounds 45m following
flotation of the company's Avonside building arm as well as the sale of most
of its stake in Betacom and the disposal of Stalbridge Kwick Klean Laundry.
Gearing is now down to 90 per cent.
The group will now focus on its distribution and building services
operations.
Most of the write-downs concerned the hotel properties. Mr Binks did not
expect further write-offs would be necessary once sales had been achieved.
He said profitability had been adversely affected by the recession and heavy
interest costs due to the high level of financial gearing.
Net interest rose from Pounds 8.5m to Pounds 11.5m.
