FT  25 MAR 92 / Appointments: Goode returns from US for Rank Xerox


Rank Xerox, jointly owned by Xerox Corporation and the Rank Organisation, is
bringing back William Goode, who had spent a six year spell with Xerox in
the US, as its new director of finance and control.
He replaces Jack Milligan, 58, who in turn moves to the Xerox headquarters
in Stamford, Connecticut to advise Paul Allaire, the chairman of Xerox, on
the business relationship with the Japanese affiliate Fuji Xerox.
Goode, who is 44 and English, has spent the past three years as finance
director of the Americas operations of Xerox, which comprises the Americas
excluding the US, and the Middle East. In terms of revenue, he says that
area of responsibility amounted to just over half that of Rank Xerox. Before
joining Rank Xerox in 1977, Goode had worked at British Leyland, where for
the past five years he had been financial controller of the Cowley complex.
In the year to October 1991, Rank's profits dipped modestly, but still
delivered what managing director Bernard Fournier called 'an excellent
result', given the environment. Goode said yesterday that 'while we are
always concerned to achieve improvements in efficiency, we are also looking
for growth in market share, in both mature and emerging markets. We have a
very powerful array of new products.'
