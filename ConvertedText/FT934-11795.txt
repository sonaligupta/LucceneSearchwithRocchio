FT  29 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: ICI


At first sight, the sharp bounce in third-quarter earnings reinforces ICI's
status as a pure recovery stock now it has been stripped of Zeneca. Yet much
of the profits improvement so far stems from a combination of cost cutting
and one-off gains. The devaluation of sterling has added around Pounds 80m
to profits this year, against the overall improvement of Pounds 72m shown by
continuing businesses. The fibres-for-acrylics swap with DuPont flatters the
underlying improvement in materials. New plant coming on stream makes the
profits recovery in industrial chemicals look better than market conditions
alone would allow.
There are green shoots sure enough. Autumn price increases in PVC and
titanium dioxide appear to be sticking for the first time in years. The
regional businesses in Australia are showing genuine improvement. But the
message from other European chemicals producers is one of continued misery.
Over-capacity in petrochemicals will depress selling prices even if demand
recovers in line with the economy. The industry is more likely to pull
slowly out of recession than show the kind of sharp cyclical recovery seen
in the early 1980s.
A concerted effort to close inefficient plant now being mooted among
European producers offers a glimmer of hope for better times. Since ICI has
taken its medicine without the benefit of subsidies, such co-ordinated
action might seem a shade unfair. If the plan ever reaches fruition, though,
ICI is well placed to benefit.
