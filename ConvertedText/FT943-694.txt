FT  28 SEP 94 / Arts: Today's Television


   By ANTONY THORNCROFT


Today is the 60th birthday of Brigitte Bardot, who has not made a movie for
over twenty years and who, even in this nostalgic age, is still not regarded
as much of a actress. But her name endures, perhaps because her provocative
pout pointed the puritanical 1950s towards the liberated 1960s. The fact
that she rubbishes stardom and her own beauty and devotes herself to animals
adds to her mystique. BBC 1 celebrates her anniversary at 9.30 with And God
created Bardot.
The Bardot movie that follows at 11.45, Viva Maria], is hardly typical. It
is a star vehicle for Bardot and Jeanne Moreau, directed by Louis Malle, who
has them romping through Latin America in the early 20th century.
The return of University Challenge (BBC 2 at 8.30) is a triumph for back to
basics, though one hopes that new question master Jeremy Paxman returns to
type and gets rattier with the students.
Somehow Ian Botham just escapes being a yob, and with a new biography to
promote he must be happy at the timing of the sympathetic portrait he
receives on BBC 1 at 10.55.
