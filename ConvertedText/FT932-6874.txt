FT  26 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Williams upset


   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON and PETER JOHN


News that Williams Holdings, the industrial conglomerate, is to lose Mr
Brian McGowan, its chief executive, sent a tremor through the stock as
investors searched for what might lie behind the resignation announcement.
There were hints that some very downbeat comment on the company would be
made in today's UK newspapers, and the shares fell 14 before rallying to end
a net 10 down at 310p after 6.4m traded.
Mr Geoff Alum at NatWest Securities said: 'McGowan was a good man and this
is a loss in the short term. However, it may prove a turning point in the
long term.'
