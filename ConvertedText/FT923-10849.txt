FT  28 JUL 92 / Home rescue scheme shunned


   By DAVID BARCHARD


MANY HOMEOWNERS in danger of eviction because of mortgage arrears are
refusing to take part in mortgage-into-rent rescue schemes, Abbey National
said yesterday.
The UK's second largest mortgage lender said about half of customers
approached with such an offer declined it.
Abbey National said: 'They fought hard to become owner-occupiers of their
homes and they do not want to become tenants again. Sometimes they tell us
that the rent they would pay after a rescue would be close to their mortgage
payments or they think their prospects might get brighter in the next couple
of months.'
About 24,400 Abbey National customers were more than six months behind with
payments at the start of the year, but only eight have been rescued by the
scheme launched in the spring.
Two other large lenders have confirmed that they are trying to design new
mortgage rescue schemes because their original ones have produced only a few
rescues.
Leeds Permanent said yesterday it is examining a scheme to speed up mortgage
rescues by allowing an outside company to buy up properties whose owners
have a severe payments backlog. They would then be allowed to stay as
tenants.
The society would be the minority shareholder in the company which would be
set up by a financial institution which it declined to name. The scheme has
yet to be approved by the Building Societies Commission.
Nationwide said yesterday it was considering possible new approaches to
mortgage rescue but refused to give details.
Later this week the Council of Mortgage Lenders will publish figures which
are expected to show a continuing rise in the number of homeowners at risk
of eviction.
