FT  28 JUL 92 / Regulator to probe electricity price rise


   By JULIET SYCHRAVA


PROFESSOR Stephen Little-child, the electricity regulator, has written to
National Power and PowerGen, the electricity generators, asking them to
explain why electricity prices have risen sharply since May.
The move could lead to a full investigation of electricity prices, and might
end with the generators being referred to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
Prof Littlechild's move comes after large electricity consumers from the
Major Energy Users Council, a lobbying group, complained in May that
electricity prices were too high.
Prices in the electricity pool, or wholesale market, rose from around 1.9p
per unit in March to around 2.3p in May, June and July, large users
complained. They alleged that the increase occured because the two
generators were bidding the price up.
'The bid prices were going up when the coal price was dropping,' said Mr
John Topliss, chairman of the council's electricity group. 'They bore no
relation to the underlying costs. Our impression was they were winding the
price up.'
Prof Littlechild, who last investigated pool prices in September, will now
give the generators time to explain the increase.
If they do this successfully, the issue may go no further. But if the
regulator is not satisfied, he will order a full inquiry into the pool,
similar to the review he published last December.
At that stage, he said it was too early to say if the pool price was too
high or too low. But he is likely to make a clear decision this time, and if
he decides it is too high, he would not rule out a referral to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
The council said it would welcome this outcome. Both generators acknowledged
that they had received a letter from Prof Littlechild, but said they
believed a full inquiry was unlikely.
