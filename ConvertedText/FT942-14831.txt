FT  19 APR 94 / Colour prejudice claim at tribunal


An Afro-Caribbean careers officer claimed she was ousted from her job in the
race relations unit of the Department of Employment because of her colour.
Miss Wilel McKenzie told an industrial tribunal in Croydon, south London,
that she was excluded from work in the office, and had clients taken away.
She was a higher executive officer and is claiming constructive dismissal
and racial discrimination.
Miss Rona Thompson, Miss McKenzie's boss, denied there had been racial
discrimination. She said: 'She looked very uncomfortable and anxious in some
situations in front of clients. I was worried about her general health.'
The hearing is expected to end by Friday.
