FT  11 MAR 94 / International Company News: Earnings drop 45% at Kepco


   By JOHN BURTON


Korea Electric Power (Kepco), the state-controlled electricity company,
reported net earnings for 1993 down 45 per cent to Won419bn (Dollars 347m),
but sales up 12 per cent to Won7,525bn, writes John Burton.
In spite of the earnings drop, Kepco had the largest profits among the
country's listed companies. It is also the biggest capitalised company on
the Seoul bourse.
Kepco blamed the lower profits on increased expenses, including power plant
construction, while electricity charges remained unchanged.
