FT  08 NOV 94 / International Company News: Bid battle hits Ambroveneto
shares

   ROME


Shares in Banco Ambrosiano Veneto (Ambroveneto) fell sharply yesterday
following the Italian bank's announcement at the weekend that its largest
shareholders would block a proposed bid from Banca Commerciale Italiana.
Ambroveneto shares slipped to L4,558 - down L674 on the day - compared with
the L7,000 price which BCI said it planned to offer when it announced its
intentions less than a week ago.
BCI has yet to comment on the latest developments and is unlikely to do so
before its self-imposed November 15 deadline for launching a formal offer.
However, Mr Giovanni Bazoli, Ambroveneto's chairman, all but declared
victory on Saturday, when he confirmed that the bank's biggest shareholders
had agreed to renew and reinforce their shareholder pact.
Credit Agricole of France and Crediop, the investment finance subsidiary of
the Italian banking group San Paolo di Torino - each of which owns 15 per
cent of Ambroveneto - are poised to buy the 13.52 per cent stake offered by
a group of small banks from the Veneto region.
Together with other pact members, the deal will secure at least 57 per cent
of Ambroveneto.
BCI hoped to buy the stake itself, as the basis for its own bid, and CA and
Crediop are thought to have matched BCI's offer.
BCI announced its approach to Ambroveneto only a week after its rival,
Credito Italiano, unveiled plans for a L2,000bn (Dollars 1.3bn) bid to gain
control of Bologna-based Credito Romagnolo.
