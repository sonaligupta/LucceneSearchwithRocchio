FT  01 JUL 92 / Chief resigns


MR PETER TURLEY has resigned as chief executive of Scarborough Building
Society after a 29 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for 1991 to Pounds 1.6m.
His departure appears to have been triggered by a board decision that
Scarborough should stick to its building society core business and avoid
further diversification.
