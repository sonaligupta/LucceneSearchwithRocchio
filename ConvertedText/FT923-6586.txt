FT  24 AUG 92 / French jails near normal

MOST of France's jails returned to normal at the weekend as prison officers
reported for work after last week's strike, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris.
Officers at most of the country's 175 prisons called off their industrial
action on Saturday following an offer by Mr Michel Vauzelle, justice
minister, to recruit an extra 730 staff in response to demands for increased
manning and better protection against violence.
The government attempted yesterday to force the remaining strikers to return
to work by threatening to invoke legislation from the 1950s denying public
employees working in sensitive sectors - including the police, magistrates
and prison officers - the right to strike.
Last week's action was in protest over the murder of a warder by an inmate
at Rouen jail. It created chaos in prisons and riot police were drafted in
to restore order.
Ministers, who have faced a series of industrial disputes throughout spring
and summer, are anxious to stabilise the political climate in France ahead
of next month's Maastricht referendum.
