FT  13 APR 92 / UK Company News: March chairman resigns as losses increase
sharply to Pounds 4m


   By ANGUS FOSTER


MARCH Group, which last year sold its specialist racing car and engineering
businesses and has been under share suspension from the USM since last July,
has announced increased losses and the resignation of its chairman, Mr John
Cowen.
In the year ended October 31 1991 pre-tax losses were Pounds 3.97m (Pounds
1.3m).
There were also extraordinary debits of Pounds 1.67m (Pounds 1.85m) stemming
from losses on the disposal of the motor racing business, provisions for a
subsidiary in receivership and legal costs. That resulted in a loss per
share of 12.7p (5.4p).
Mr Cowen retired on Friday and is being replaced as non-executive chairman
by Mr David Cunningham, a corporate financier. Williams de Broe, the
stockbroker, has also proposed, and had accepted, the appointment of two
businessmen as executive directors.
March has finished winding down Cobbold Roach, the Southampton stockbroker
acquired from Elders IXL. During March's ten months of ownership, Cobbold
ran up more than Pounds 1m in losses and was made 'virtually worthless' by a
major fraud, the company said. Although most of Cobbald's liabilities have
been met, some small claims are outstanding, leading to the freezing of some
surplus cash balances.
Two court cases involving March have been settled out of court, although
both led to lower than hoped for awards to March. Early this year, the
company accepted a Pounds 2.1m settlement from Alfa Lancia which followed a
disputed contract. An earlier settlement of Dollars 750,000 had been agreed
with Patrick Racing in a related dispute.
