FT  08 NOV 94 / Office prices 'to stay sluggish'


   By SIMON LONDON


The growth in commercial property prices will not be as strong as previously
thought, with the market likely to remain sluggish for the remainder of this
year and next, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors says.
The London Business School commercial property model, sponsored by the
institution, is forecasting capital growth of 9 per cent this year and 2.6
per cent next year.
This represents a considerable fall compared with predictions earlier in the
year. In June the model predicted that capital values would rise 18 per cent
this year and 7 per cent next.
Mr Richard Lay, for the institution's commercial property section, said that
pressure on company profit margins and sluggish demand for new retail and
industrial space meant that the strong recovery experienced at the start of
the year had not been sustained.
He said: 'The office sector has been hardest hit due to the government's
rise in interest rates. This has affected a market already characterised by
excess supply.'
The London Business School model forecasts that the year-on-year rate of
capital growth from commercial property will decline to 1.4 per cent in the
second quarter next year from 14.2 per cent in the third quarter of this
year before gently accelerating as demand for business space picks up.
The annualised rate of capital growth is expected to peak at 10.8 per cent
in the first quarter of 1997.
