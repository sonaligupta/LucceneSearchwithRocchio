FT  02 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Bass acquires 34% of Prague Breweries


   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE


BASS, the UK's leading brewer, has agreed to acquire a 34 per cent stake in
Prague Breweries, the second largest brewer in the Czech Republic, for
Pounds 9m.
The deal is Bass's first overseas brewing venture since it sold its interest
in Lamot, the Belgian brewer, 12 years ago.
Mr Ian Prosser, Bass chairman and chief executive, yesterday described the
Prague deal as 'an important first step' in the group's search for
opportunities for international expansion.
It offered good prospects for further development in the Czech market and
for increased exports, he said.
The Prague group, which will have net assets of Pounds 30m after the deal is
completed, plans to invest Pounds 50m over the next five years in expanding
and modernising its three breweries. It has a 10 per cent share of the Czech
beer market which is about a quarter the size of that of the UK.
Prague's sales of Pounds 36m last year included a significant contribution
from exports, mainly to eastern and central Europe.
Bass will introduce Prague's leading premium lager, Staropramen, into the UK
and a number of other international markets next year.
The UK brewer will have four seats on the Prague board and a number of
senior managers will be seconded to the group.
