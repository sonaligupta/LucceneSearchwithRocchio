FT  26 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Argyll


The fall in Argyll's share price in response to a 14 per cent increase in
full year profits is typical of its harsh treatment at the hands of the
market. Having underperformed the plummeting food retailing sector by 10 per
cent since the turn of the year the company might have expected as much.
There seems little hope of closing the rating gap on J. Sainsbury.
Argyll has not won friends in a nervous stock market by increasing capital
expenditure again this year. Yet by planning to increase space annually by
around 7 per cent, it is only keeping pace with the best of the competition.
And its cost per new store remains well below Sainsbury, despite an increase
in the average last year thanks to a concentration of new openings close to
London.
True, Safeway's own-label products account for a lower proportion of sales
than Sainsbury. If that makes it more vulnerable to the cut-priced branded
goods offered by discount retailers, Argyll's rating might be expected to
suffer. But with few signs of slippage in yesterday's figures, it is hard to
avoid the conclusion that the market is trying too hard to find reasons to
sell.
