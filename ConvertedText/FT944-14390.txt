FT  22 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Liquidators at Orion Insurance


   By REUTER


   AMSTERDAM


The gross liabilities of Internationale Nederlanden Groep's deconsolidated
operations Orion Insurance and London and Overseas Insurance may be Dollars
1.5bn (Pounds 926m), provisional liquidators to the companies said, Reuter
reports from Amsterdam.
The two firms stopped taking on new business in 1992 and their operations
were deconsolidated from their Dutch parent in April 1993.
Price Waterhouse accountants Mr Paul Evans and Mr Richard Boys-Stones, who
were appointed provisional liquidators to Orion yesterday, said they had not
yet had an opportunity to examine the financial position of the underwriting
firms.
But 'it is thought that the gross liabilities might be of the order of
Dollars 1.5bn', they said.
