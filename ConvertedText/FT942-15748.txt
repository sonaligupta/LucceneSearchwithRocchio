FT  14 APR 94 / Teamsters' strike hits Alaska


   By AP


   ANCHORAGE


Supermarkets in Alaska are struggling to keep the shelves stocked after a
nationwide trucking strike by the Teamsters' union cut off the flow of
merchandise by ship from the west coast, AP reports from Anchorage.
Teamsters in Alaska are not part of the strike by about 70,000 drivers, dock
workers and mechanics. But longshoremen have been honouring the union's
picket lines at three west coast ports used by Alaska shippers, including
Tacoma, Washington, the main port.
The Teamsters went on strike against 22 trucking companies on April 6 over a
push to use more part-time workers and more trains. Since then two trucking
companies have reached interim agreements, and a third has gone out of
business.
It is the Teamsters' first nationwide strike against the trucking industry
since 1979.
