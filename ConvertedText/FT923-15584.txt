FT  01 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Meeting sparks hope for Ulster
talks


   By RALPH ATKINS


UNIONISTS yesterday injected a measure of optimism into all-party talks on
Northern Ireland's future by participating - apparently constructively - in
an unprecedented meeting with Irish ministers, Ralph Atkins writes.
The Rev Ian Paisley, the hardline leader of the Democratic Unionist party
who has in the past thrown snowballs in anger at an Irish prime minister,
spent two hours in London with a delegation that included Mr David Andrews,
the Irish foreign minister.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, now faces the difficult job
of moving the talks formally from 'strand one' - on devolution in the
province - to 'strand two', where the Irish Republic enters actual
negotiations, rather than just 'talks about talks' such as those at
yesterday's meeting. Mr Andrews left the meeting saying that the move had to
be made 'as quickly as possible'. Sir Patrick refused to comment but is
expected to chair a plenary session of 'strand one' in Belfast today that
would allow him to consult leaders of local parties.
Even if Sir Patrick was able to announce the opening of 'strand two' this
week - and it is not clear Unionists will agree - less than a month remains
before the talks process is supposed to end, with little apparent agreement
on areas discussed so far.
Yesterday was a 'preliminary' meeting that agreed an agenda for 'strand
three' - technically involving only the UK and Irish governments but with
local politicians acting as observers.
