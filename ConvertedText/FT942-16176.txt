FT  12 APR 94 / Technology: Speedy business tool


   By ANDREW FISHER


Multimedia has been hyped mostly as a provider of news and entertainment
rather than a help for business.
But some companies have turned to this combination of voice, pictures and
text - using computers, telephones and video - to speed up operations and
save costs. Frost & Sullivan, the US market researcher, forecasts a
multimedia market in Europe of Dollars 3.6bn (Pounds 2.5bn) by 1996, with
the fastest growth in desktop systems.
One of the first UK companies to use multimedia as a business tool is
Colorgraphic, which produces direct marketing and sales promotion leaflets.
It turned to this technology to improve communications with agents and
customers in continental Europe, especially in Germany and the Netherlands,
and so lift exports.
Colorgraphic is the first European user of the Visit (visually interactive
technology) system from Canada's Northern Telecom. The UK company's products
are all of different designs. Agreeing these with clients can take time,
especially if changes are needed. Now, by communicating visually and
verbally through Visit and putting designs on screen, the process from
design to printing agreement can be completed in hours rather than days.
'Everything we do starts as a reel of white paper but ends as an intricate
finished product,' says Michael Hunter, chief executive. Colorgraphic wants
more foreign customers. 'Often, we or they had to hop on a plane. Courier
costs were Pounds 25,000 a year - air fares cost the same and hotel bills
were high. This was about Pounds 100,000 and we will save a lot of that.'
Colorgraphic, whose main competitors are in Germany, spent Pounds 250,000 on
Visit and communications technology. 'It's much easier to make something
clear,' says Armin Kleiss, production manager at ECM, its Dutch agent. 'We
can show what a product is like while we talk about it.'
