FT  29 OCT 93 / International Company News: Indupa seeks protection


   By JOHN BARHAM


INDUPA, a leading Argentine chemical company, has filed for protection from
bank creditors. It owes them Dollars 450m.
Indupa made the announcement after it decided not to sign a debt
rescheduling package with banks led by Banque Nationale de Paris and Banco
Roberts, a local bank 30 per cent owned by Midland Bank.
The company's problems are blamed on poor management, high operating costs
and low prices for its bulk chemical commodities. Sales in the financial
year to June fell by one third to Dollars 64.3m and its net loss rose
slightly to Dollars 79.9m.
Argentine law offers troubled companies privileges similar to those under
Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy law. The Argentine code stipulates no term
for debt repayment, but is under revision by the government.
One banker said: 'Indupa negotiated a rescheduling but then decided it was
unable to sign when it realised that a 5 per cent fall in prices would cost
it Dollars 9m a year in cashflow.'
Indupa shares have fallen by over a quarter since Wednesday.
