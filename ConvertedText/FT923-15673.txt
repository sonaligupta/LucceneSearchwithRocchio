FT  01 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Chrysalis plans satellite TV game show
channel


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


CHRYSALIS, the music publishing, communications and media company, is
planning to launch the UK's first game show channel on satellite television.
The company has acquired the television rights to 14,000 American game shows
and plans to run them non-stop for 18 hours a day.
Chrysalis, in partnership with Mr Howard Huntridge, the television game show
specialist, is trying to raise Pounds 15m for the venture.
So far there has been little investment interest in the project from the UK
and talks are about to begin with potential US backers.
The aim would be to launch the channel on cable television in the autumn and
move to the new Astra satellite a year from now. Negotiations are at an
advanced stage with SES, the Luxembourg company that runs the Astra
satellite system, for an option.
Apart from advertising and sponsorship income further revenue is envisaged
from viewers taking part in games by telephone and a television shopping
segment.
