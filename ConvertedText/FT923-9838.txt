FT  03 AUG 92 / Letter: Care for customers


   From Mr ROGER BURRELL


Sir, The answer to poor customer service reported in the National Consumer
Council's report, 'Consumer Concerns 1992' ('Stores receive customer
praise', July 30), is to invest 50 per cent of your training budget on
customer care.
Surprise and delight your customers. The result of our investment is more
satisfied customers and a balance sheet that is the envy of our competitors.
Roger Burrell,
managing director,
ICL Customer Service,
