BOVIS (THAILAND) has been awarded a USDollars 50m (Pounds 26m) construction
management contract to build a high rise headquarters in Bangkok for a local

Pre-construction work on the 700,000 sq ft development is now under way,
with building scheduled to start early in 1993, for completion in two years.
The upper floors of the multi-storey office block will include a number of
