FT  26 MAY 93 / International Company News: Accounting change puts Varity
into deficit


   By JEREMY BENNALLACK-HART


VARITY, the US automotive, farm and industrial equipment maker, reported
first-quarter income of Dollars 11m before one-off charges of Dollars 146.1m
for changes in accounting methods. The group suffered a net loss of Dollars
2.4m in last year's first quarter.
Earnings per share were shown at 20 cents before the charge, with a loss per
share of Dollars 4.50 after the charge. Last time, the loss per share was 28
cents.
Sales fell to Dollars 645m from Dollars 823.8m, reflecting the disposal of
several businesses last year to reduce debt and fund future growth.
Mr Victor Rice, chairman and chief executive officer, said the disposals had
had an immediate impact on earnings. After reducing consolidated debt by
more than Dollars 800m last year, he said, interest expense was Dollars
10.7m in the quarter, down more than 70 per cent on last year.
He added that continuing robust US car production and worldwide acceleration
of ABS applications were 'favourable developments' for the group.
Kelsey-Hayes, the automotive components unit, reported sales of Dollars 302m
and operating income of Dollars 25m, up 39 per cent adjusted for disposals.
Massey Ferguson turned in operating losses of Dollars 2m on sales of Dollars
189m. Mr Rice said this was a respectable performance because the first
quarter was traditionally the weakest in the farm equipment sector while
Europe - Massey's main market - was down 10 per cent.
Perkins' operating income was steady in the quarter despite the recession in
Europe, while sales were down 13 per cent to Dollars 158m - although they
would have been unchanged after allowing for currency fluctuations.
Varity said order rates for shipment later in the year had improved
significantly on year-ago levels.
