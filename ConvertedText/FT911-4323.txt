FT  19 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Farming reform call


MR JOHN GUMMER, the agriculture minister, condemned the European Community's
farming policies as 'bankrupt' yesterday and said the government would be
pressing for a swift reform of the common agricultural policy. He said the
community needed to move towards more realistic prices at a pace the
agricultural community could accept. Mr Gummer also reiterated his
disagreement with the McSharry proposals to reform the CAP.
'You cannot bribe people to stay on uneconomic plots,' he said.
