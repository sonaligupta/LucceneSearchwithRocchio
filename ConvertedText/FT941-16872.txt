FT  07 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: What pursuit of efficiency fails to
consider


   From Mr GRAHAM HALLETT


Sir, There have recently been many reports of job losses in various
industries, which are invariably welcomed in your columns as a sign of
improved 'productivity', or 'efficiency'.
Is this necessarily so? The British coalmines which have been closed are set
to cause serious river pollution ('Abandoned pits pour out a toxic threat',
December 22). Most of the displaced miners will remain unemployed, and the
bill for imported coal will rise sharply.
In the Post Office, the fall in the numbers of counter workers which is
promised after privatisation will mean that there will be no time to give
advice to old ladies. In 'social housing', 'efficiency' means building the
largest number of housing units possible with the (small and falling) amount
of public subsidy available, irrespective of the needs of the tenants,
architectural merit or long-term maintenance costs. And so on, in industry
after industry.
Does not the ruthless pursuit of a narrowly defined 'efficiency' which now
dominates public policy leave many important matters out of account?
