FT  09 JUN 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Bank managers called to
account - In a Nutshell


Banks must shift more lending authority back to their local branch managers
while the managers should visit their customers more often to get a greater
understanding of their business.
These are two of the main requests expressed by businessmen and women in a
survey* of 100 managers and more than 1,200 companies with sales of more
than Pounds 2m, carried out by accountants Coopers & Lybrand.
Businessmen and women, for their part, should produce a business plan for
their bank manager with regularly updated budgets and projections.
They must improve the quality of management information generally, bank
managers said.
