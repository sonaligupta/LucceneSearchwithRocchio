FT  13 APR 92 / UK Company News: CRA facing difficult year

CRA, the Australian mining house, faces further earnings difficulties in
1992 following the net profit fall from Dollars A472.5m to Dollars A350m in
1991.
Mr John Uhrig, the chairman, and Mr John Ralph, managing director, have
outlined another year of pressure in the annual report.
Mr Ralph said it would be imprudent to try to anticipate the timing of a
recovery in metal prices and demand. 'In the medium to long-term, the
recovery of the principal economies and the reconstruction of the Eastern
European economies should see metal prices rise,' he claimed.
"However, the immediate effect of the changes occuring in Eastern Europe and
the former USSR has been to increase the amount of metal in world markets,
swelling inventories and dampening prices.
"While no resource company can escape the global influence of diminished
economic growth rates, the CRA group is favourably placed in relation to its
international competition."
Mr Uhrig said there was unlikely to be a marked improvement in demand for
the company's products in 1992. 'However, the far from favourable conditions
which persisted during 1991 still saw some significant improvements in
several of CRA's businesses.
'I am confident that similar gains in efficiency will be sought and obtained
throughout the CRA business units in the current year."
Gearing remained among the lowest of any Australian resource company,
although rising from 20 to 25 per cent.
