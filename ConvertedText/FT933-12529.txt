FT  23 JUL 93 / AT&T shakes up its top management


   By MARTIN DICKSON


   NEW YORK


AMERICAN Telephone & Telegraph, the US communications giant, yesterday shook
up its top management structure to position itself better for global
expansion and the convergence of the telecommunications, computer and media
industries.
The restructuring centres on the creation of a seven-member global
operations team, responsible for running AT&T's businesses worldwide.
It will be chaired by Mr Victor Pelson, 56, who was the head of
telecommunications services. He will also become a member of the AT&T board.
The team, which may be enlarged later, replaces a five-person operations
committee, chairmanship of which rotated among the heads of AT&T's business
lines.
Mr Robert Allen, chairman, wants 50 per cent of AT&T's revenues to come from
abroad by the end of the decade, compared with 25 per cent now. He said the
aim of the moves was to 'globalise the business more quickly and take
advantage of new market opportunities' from industrial convergence.
Mr William Marx, 54, who heads AT&T Network Systems business, will take on
additional responsibilities for AT&T's worldwide purchasing and global
manufacturing planning.
The restructuring gives new responsibilities to three executives regarded as
possibilities to succeed Mr Allen. They are Mr Alex Mandl, 49, chief
financial officer who moves to head communications services; Mr Robert
Kavner, 50, who will lead the multi-media products and services group; and
Mr Jerre Stead, 50, head of the group's NCR computer business.
