FT  08 NOV 93 / Princess pictures may speed press law


   By PHILIP STEPHENS and ROBERT CORZINE


THE GOVERNMENT last night faced intense pressure to speed the introduction
of a new privacy law after publication in the Sunday Mirror of un-authorised
photographs of the Princess of Wales in a private gymnasium.
Further photographs appear in today's Daily Mirror, which says it will not
be 'cowed by the hysterical accusations now being made against it'.
Ministers said last night that publication would strengthen greatly the
hands of those in the government pressing for legislation to introduce a new
civil tort of privacy.
The latest controversy over pictures of the royal family will also lead to
fresh calls on the newspaper industry to appoint an ombudsman to work
alongside the Press Complaints Commission.
Some ministers believe the ombudsman should have power to fine newspapers
found to be in breach of the privacy guidelines.
Lord McGregor, chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, yesterday
condemned the Sunday Mirror for publishing the photographs.
