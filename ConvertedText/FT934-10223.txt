FT  06 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Lower charges help lift reorganised Wm Cook
to Pounds 3.35m


   By PAUL TAYLOR


WILLIAM COOK, the Sheffield-based steel castings group, has reported a
substantial increase in interim pre-tax profits, reflecting lower interest
charges and the absence of both reorganisation costs and losses on its
discontinued US operations.
Pre-tax profits in the six months to September 25 increased to Pounds 3.35m
from Pounds 604,000 a year ago. Turnover from continuing operations
increased by 4 per cent to Pounds 48m, compared with Pounds 46.1m in the
first half last year.
The discontinued US operations added another Pounds 3.47m.
Earnings per share jumped to 10.27p (1.93p) and the group announced an
increased interim divided of 2.5p (1.5p). The stock closed up 8p at 260p.
In spite of 'very difficult trading conditions' the company said its UK
businesses 'performed satisfactorily,' while the sale of the group's
loss-making Unitcast US steel casting operations to its management last
December removed Pounds 1.11m of trading losses recorded in the year-ago
period.
The UK operations posted trading profits of Pounds 3.91m in the latest
period compared to Pounds 3.77m a year earlier. Profits last time were also
depressed by Pounds 623,000 reorganisation costs.
Net interest costs fell to Pounds 551,000 (Pounds 1.43m).
Commenting on the outlook Mr Andrew Cook, chairman and chief executive, said
the prospects for UK manufacturing continue to be poor. 'The demise of UK
coal mining, coupled with a lack of infrastructure investment in roads and
railways, is not good for us.'
'Also worrying are the recent indications of further defence cuts. The deep
recession in mainland Europe also affects us by hindering our export efforts
and increasing the attempts of subsidised European producers to penetrate
our existing markets.'
