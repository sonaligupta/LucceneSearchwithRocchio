FT  23 JUL 93 / Ex-BNL manager to face fewer charges


   By ALAN FRIEDMAN


   NEW YORK


THE Clinton administration is planning to reduce drastically the number of
charges in its indictment of Mr Christopher Drogoul, the former manager of
the Atlanta branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro accused of making
Dollars 5bn of illegal loans to Iraq.
The Justice Department's formal court filing of the new indictment, which is
expected to eliminate as many as 275 of the 347 counts, could come as early
as today. Judge Ernest Tidwell, who will preside over the Atlanta trial
which begins on September 8, was informed of the change by prosecutors last
week.
Officials involved in the long-running BNL case say many of the charges
about to be dropped appear to relate to allegations that Mr Drogoul misled
the US government about the loans. If this is so, it would amount to a tacit
admission that at least some US government agencies had knowledge of the
Iraqi loans.
The BNL indictment, first brought in February 1991, charged Mr Drogoul with
false statements to bank regulators, money laundering, defrauding BNL's Rome
headquarters and misleading the US government.
The Justice Department has yet to address the issue of BNL loans being used
to fund US and European companies that contributed to Iraq's missile,
nuclear and chemical weapons projects.
Controversy has dogged the case for two years and Democratic allegations of
a cover-up by the Bush administration were made during last year's
presidential election campaign.
Former president George Bush recently received a subpoena from Mr Drogoul's
lawyers to testify in the trial.
In a related development, it has been learned that the US Federal Reserve,
which has re-opened its BNL investigation, is planning to question bank
officials in Rome next month.
