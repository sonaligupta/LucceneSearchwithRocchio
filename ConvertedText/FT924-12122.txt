FT  22 OCT 92 / Letter: Matchstick economics has merit


   From Mr E E ALDRIDGE


Sir, Prof Michael D Stephens' implied criticism of Sir Alec Douglas-Home's
mastery of economics (Letters, October 19) should not be allowed to pass
unheeded. Sir Alec's autocratic manner obscured his point that economics
might be understood using a matchstick model. Recent events suggest his
approach has merit, if only to save money on computers. Economics, as a
science, is only a tower of mathematical logic on foundations of sand.
Economists, like others, are wise after events.
