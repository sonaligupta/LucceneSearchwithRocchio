FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Government Statements): Car write-down increased
50% - Capital Allowances


THE CHANCELLOR proposes to remove the restriction on capital allowances
which can be claimed for expenditure on business cars costing between Pounds
8,000 and Pounds 12,000. The maximum writing-down allowance available for a
business car in any one year will be increased from Pounds 2,000 to Pounds
3,000.
In addition, rental payments for cars with a retail price when new of up to
Pounds 12,000 will in future be fully allowable for tax purposes, subject to
normal business tax rules.
Increased relief will also be available for rental payments in respect of
cars with a retail price of more than this amount.
These measures will benefit businesses either purchasing or leasing cars
costing more than Pounds 8,000. Some 80 per cent of business cars bought in
1992-93 are expected to fall below the new Pounds 12,000 limit.
The changes will apply to writing-down allowances for cars bought after
yesterday.
Tax relief available to businesses which buy or lease cars has been limited
since 1961. At present, relief is restricted for most cars costing over
Pounds 8,000. This figure, which was last increased in 1979, is being raised
to Pounds 12,000.
As a result, there will be no restriction on the relief available to cars
which cost, or, in the case of leased cars, have a retail price when new of
between Pounds 8,000 and Pounds 12,000.
Maximum writing-down allowances each year for cars costing more than Pounds
12,000 will be increased by a half, and a larger proportion of rental
payments for cars priced above this amount will be allowable for tax
purposes.
Computer software
The chancellor proposes to extend machinery and plant capital allowances to
cover capital expenditure by businesses on computer software licences and
software distributed by electronic means.
At present, capital allowances are available for capital expenditure
incurred on the outright acquisition of computer software. But in some cases
where capital sums are paid for software licences or the provision of
software by electronic means, there is no entitlement to allowances.
Under the proposals, capital expenditure on licensed software or
electronically transmitted software will be treated as if it were
expenditure on machinery or plant. This means that capital expenditure on
software will receive the same treatment for tax purposes regardless of
whether it is for a licence, access to electronic transmission or outright
purchase.
