FT  11 JAN 92 / Finance & The Family: Revenue approves BES move


Johnson Fry has announced that the Inland Revenue has given it the go-ahead
to use Business Expansion Scheme funds to support a mortgage rescue scheme.
JF's Eighth Super Growth scheme will aim to raise Pounds 5m, which will be
used to pay for houses which have been bought by the Bedfordshire Pilgrims
Housing Association from people who are behind with their mortgage payments.
The BPHA plans to charge the existing tenants a rent for the five years the
BES funds last, and then offer them the opportunity to buy back their
houses. Growth on the scheme, provided the BPHA is able to meet its
commitments at the end of five years, would be equivalent to 16.49 per cent
per annum for a top-rate taxpayer.
