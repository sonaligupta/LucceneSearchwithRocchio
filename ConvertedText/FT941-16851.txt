FT  07 JAN 94 / Dixons shares fall on warning


   By NEIL BUCKLEY


Shares in Dixons, the UK's largest electrical retailer, plunged from 283p to
240p yesterday, after it rushed out a profits warning following
disappointing Christmas sales.
Dixons also announced pre-tax losses of Pounds 196.7m for the 28 weeks to
November 13, after exceptional charges of Pounds 214m virtually all on the
sale of its loss-making US chain Silo to Fretter, the US electrical
retailer.
It brought the announcement forward by six days after receiving figures
showing Christmas sales volumes little changed from last year. 'We felt we
could not allow relatively false trading in the shares for another week,'
said Mr John Clare, chief executive.
The poor Christmas result was due mainly to a price war in the computer
games sector - which had performed spectacularly well in an otherwise
lacklustre market the previous Christmas.
Mr Clare said the consequent fall in profit margins meant retail operating
profits were 'unlikely to equal last year's level'. Analysts downgraded
profits forecasts for the full year from about Pounds 90m to Pounds 75m.
Dixons' first-half performance was more in line with expectations. Stripping
out exceptional items, pre-tax profits improved from Pounds 14m to Pounds
17.3m and turnover from continuing operations increased from Pounds 571m to
Pounds 752.4m.
UK retail sales increased 13 per cent to Pounds 642.9m, although operating
profits were up only 3 per cent to Pounds 19.4m, reflecting pressure on
margins from price competition and rising import costs. Sales from existing
stores increased 10 per cent in the Currys superstore chain, 2 per cent in
Currys high street stores and 1 per cent in Dixons.
The European property business converted a Pounds 400,000 loss into a Pounds
5.1m profit as sales leapt from Pounds 2.7m to Pounds 109.5m with the
disposal of the Beaulieu office development in Brussels.
Dixons lifted the interim dividend from 1.6p to 1.7p, in spite of incurring
a loss per share after exceptionals of 49.2p, compared with 0.9p earnings.
Before exceptionals, earnings were 1.8p.
As well as upgrading Mr Clare's position from managing director to chief
executive, Dixons announced that Mr Mark Souhami, deputy chairman, would
switch from a full-time to a part-time role.
