volume declines to 10-year low

SHARE prices lost ground in subdued trading as volume fell to 121m shares,
the lowest since August 1982, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue Nikkei average ended 200.83 down at 15,709.45 after a day's
high of 15,954.44 and low of 15,665.40. The index rose at mid-morning on
light index-linked buying, but later drifted lower on small-lot speculative
selling.
Volume dropped from Friday's 200m as investors remained inactive. Falls led
advances by 621 to 289, with 156 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all
first section stocks slipped 11.81 to 1,207.44, and in London the ISE/Nikkei
50 index eased 1.65 to 955.92.
Stock prices moved in tandem with the futures market, with little demand
from investors. Traders expressed worries about the meagre turnover and were
pessimistic about the effects of lower interest rates. An analyst at Daiwa
Securities commented: 'Rates on bank deposits are being lowered next week,
but the market lacks incentives to attract investors.'
According to Daiwa, the daily average trading value on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange fell from June's Y219.2bn to Y189.2bn in July, moving below Y200bn
for the first time since August 1984.
Foreign investors, who had been steady buyers of Japanese stocks, have also
turned negative on the Tokyo market. The Finance Ministry said foreigners
sold a net Dollars 1.96bn worth of Japanese stocks in June, turning net
sellers for the first time since November 1990.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the domestic telecom company, receded Y6,000
to Y582,000 and KDD, the international telecom group, lost Y140 to Y8,200.
The lifting of the foreign ownership ban on the two stocks at the start of
this month has failed to attract buyers.
High-technology issues retreated on profit-taking. Toshiba, the most active
issue of the day, dipped Y4 to Y610 and Hitachi Y3 to Y720.
Speculative theme stocks weakened as dealers and individuals liquidated
short-term holdings. Meiji Milk Products fell Y40 to Y835. However, some
suppliers of satellite television parts rose on hopes that the Olympic Games
would boost demand for satellite television sets. Ikegami Tsushinki advanced
Y38 to Y775 and Denki Kogyo Y30 to Y630.
In Osaka, the OSE average lost 123.89 to 17,626.86 in turnover of 6.4m
shares, down from Friday's 12.9m. Trading volume on the OSE in July fell 2.7
per cent from June to 328.3m shares, the lowest monthly figure since May
1958.
Volume of the Nikkei 225 stock index futures fell 5.4 per cent from the
previous month to 1.2m contracts, with average daily turnover dropping 9.5
per cent to 51,808 contracts. Futures options traded during July totalled
974,737 lots, up 22.9 per cent from June.
Roundup
THE Pacific Rim put in a mixed performance yesterday.

HKDollars 54.5, while Cheung Kong, which reports half-time figures on

for the May shooting of pro-democracy campaigners. The SET index gained

reported a sharp contraction in cotton yarn sales. The 100-share index lost
39.15 to 1,247.12.
BOMBAY came off the day's lows, aided by late institutional support. The BSE
