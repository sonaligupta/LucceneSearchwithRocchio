listing


   By REUTERS


MALAYSIA'S national car manufacturer, Perusahaan Otomobil Nasional (Proton),
will offer 55.4m MDollars 1 shares at MDollars 5 each to the public to seek
a stock exchange listing, officials said, Reuter reports.
Proton is owned jointly by state-owned Hicom, the finance ministry,
Mitsubishi Corp and Mitsubishi Motors.
Proton will also issue 88.8m shares to approved ethnic Bumiputra investors,
including a minimum of 2m shares to state-owned Permodalan Nasional (PNB),
Mr Jamil Jan, chairman, said. Proton directors and staff will be allocated
another 5.77m shares.
The car-maker is due to be listed on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange before
the end of March.
After the listing, state-owned Hicom will reduce its equity in Proton to
29.2 per cent from 41.74 per cent, while the Minister of Finance
Incorporated's stake will fall to 17.8 per cent from 26.47 per cent. Equity
held by Mitsubishi and Mitsubishi Motors will fall to 8.7 per cent from
12.45 per cent.
Mr Jamil said the group had command of the domestic car market and, with
growing exports, investors were assured of earnings and dividends.
He said it was forecast to earn a pre-tax profit of MDollars 406.6m
(USDollars 150.6m) for the financial year ending March 31 1992, on turnover
of MDollars 2.1bn, against a pre-tax profit of MDollars 261.4m in 1991 on
turnover of MDollars 1.8bn.
Mr Jamil said Proton's share of the domestic market was projected to be
maintained at 64 per cent for the next five years. However, the introduction
of a second national car could affect sales.
