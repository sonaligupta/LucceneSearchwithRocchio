FT  20 APR 94 / UK Company News: GKN lifts Westland stake to 91%


   By TIM BURT


GKN, the engineering and industrial services group, yesterday said it had
won control of 90.8 per cent of Westland following its revised offer for the
helicopter manufacturer.
The 335p cash offer, which values Westland at Pounds 577m, was accepted by
shareholders controlling 126.8m ordinary Westland shares.
GKN has also agreed to buy a further 1.1m ordinary shares, which will take
its total interest to 91.6 per cent.
The near-complete takeover should enable GKN to derive the tax advantages
that, it could be argued, first prompted the bid.
By integrating Westland into its own defence business, the proportion of
GKN's sales originating in the UK should exceed 40 per cent.
This would allow it to recover more advance corporation tax to set against
its mainstream tax liability.
The engineering group, however, has been forced to scale back its partial
share alternative - worth 194.7p in cash and a quarter of a new GKN share -
after it was almost 30 per cent oversubscribed.
Institutions applied for 33.6m shares, against the 26m available, after
calculating the partial share offer was worth almost 3 per cent more than
the cash alternative.
GKN has, meanwhile, received valid acceptances for 92.47 per cent of
Westland's convertible preference shares and 86.24 per cent of the warrants.
