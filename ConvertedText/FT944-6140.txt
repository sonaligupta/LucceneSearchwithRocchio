Finnair, the Finnish national carrier, plans to raise about FM500m (Dollars
103.3m) through an offer of up to 12m new shares to domestic and
international investors.
Proceeds will be used to buy second-hand McDonnell Douglas MD-80 aircraft to
replace its DC-9 fleet. The five-year investment programme is worth about
FM1.7bn.
The state will not participate in the issue, cutting its holding to 60.9 per
cent (57.5 per cent after full dilution) from 71.5 per cent (66.9 per cent
after dilution). Kleinwort Benson is global co-ordinator for the issue.
Neste, the Finnish oil and petrochemical group, is also selling part of its
stake in Finnair.
In the half-year to September 30 the airline reported a better than expected
pre-tax profit of FM298.9m, up from FM95.3m last time.
