FT  12 MAR 92 / International Company News: Court approves Revco bankruptcy
proposals


   By NIKKI TAIT


   NEW YORK


THE END to another big US retail bankruptcy came into sight yesterday, when
a US bankruptcy court approved the reorganisation plan put forward by Revco.
The plan is likely to take effect within a few weeks.
Revco, based in Ohio, operates 1,150 drug stores in 10 states and is one of
the nation's largest chains.
The retailer's prospective 'rebirth' echoes the successful re-emergence from
bankruptcy of the Allied and Federated Department Stores chains - previously
part of Campeau Corporation - earlier this year.
Revco was taken private via a leveraged buyout in 1986, and filed for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy less than two years later.
