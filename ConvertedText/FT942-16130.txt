FT  12 APR 94 / Observer: Quiet Lauda


Lauda Air, the Austrian airline founded by former motor racing world
champion Nikki Lauda, is having a busy month, opening up new Vienna-based
European regional network services to Barcelona, Madrid, Brussels, Geneva
and Munich. Yesterday was Manchester's turn.
However, Lauda himself couldn't be there - it was his turn to fly Lauda's
Madrid route. Instead, he will land in Manchester today. But Lauda fans will
have to be quick - he takes off on the return Vienna journey at 9am, only 45
minutes after landing. He may be on the ground a bit longer, though, by
virtue of landing earlier. 'They always seem to go faster when he's at the
controls,' says a loyal aide.
