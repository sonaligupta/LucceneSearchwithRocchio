FT  06 AUG 93 / Japan tool orders down by 25.6%

Machine tool orders in Japan were down by more than a quarter in the first
half of the year and orders for the whole year may be the lowest for a
decade as domestic manufacturers continue to cut capital spending, writes
Gordon Cramb in Tokyo.
The Japan Machine Tool Builders' Association said yesterday that orders for
the six months to June were Y287.3bn (Pounds 1.82bn), down 25.6 per cent.
Export orders were down only 8.6 per cent from the same period of 1992 but
those placed by customers at home fell 33.2 per cent.
It said that in the absence of a sharp recovery, full-year order intake may
emerge at only some Y600bn. This would bring them back to or even below the
levels of 1982-83 and more than halved from their peak Y1,412bn achieved in
1990.
Orders from Japanese automotive and electronics groups, the two main sets of
customers, each fell by more than a third amid overcapacity and weak
consumer demand for their end-products.
