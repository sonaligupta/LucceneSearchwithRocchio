FT  12 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo weak again but
Hong Kong hits record high


   By EMIKO TERAZONO


   TOKYO


THE WEAKER yen and concern about another loss compensation scandal depressed
share prices yesterday, and the Nikkei average fell to its lowest level
since October 1990, writes Emiko Terazono.
The Nikkei declined 262.45 to 20,592.14, compared with 20,221.86 on October
1, 1990. The index opened at the day's high of 20,811.30 and hit a low of
20,567.59 in the morning session. Volume rose to 250m shares from 200m on
cross-trading ahead of the March fiscal year-end. Declines led advances by
745 to 222, with 155 issues unchanged. The Topix index lost 16.31 at
1,478.48, the lowest close since November 1986, and in London the ISE/Nikkei
50 index slipped 5.04 to 1,116.16.
Traders said the Nikkei did not reflect the whole market accurately. 'The
Nikkei is only above the 20,000 level due to the illiquid stocks held in
arbitrageurs' baskets,' commented Mr Peter Johnson at Baring Securities.
The 20,000 level on the Nikkei is considered to be a critical point for
banks to maintain capital to asset ratios laid down by the Bank of
International Settlements. However, market participants now say that this
level is irrelevant since portfolios at most banks are broadly based and
stock holdings resemble that of components of the more representative Topix
index.
While foreigners remained neutral yesterday, domestic investors, including
investment trusts and corporations, continued to liquidate holdings ahead of
the March book closing. A total of 245 issues hit new lows since January
last year. Domestic institutions, which need to raise funds, have continued
to sell liquid stocks. Hitachi shed Y4 to Y756 and Nippon Steel Y5 to Y305.
According to think tanks at the top 12 Japanese brokers, pre-tax profits for
Japanese companies excluding financial institutions are expected to decline
sharply. For the year to end-March, pre-tax profits are expected to fall
15.5 per cent, while a 4.3 per cent drop is projected for next year.
Brokerage issues fell yesterday as a court ordered Daiwa Securities to pay
Y49bn in a settlement over a portfolio loss dispute with Tokyu Department
Store. After the close, Daiwa announced the resignation of Mr Masahiro
Dozen, the company's president. Traders said the settlement could lead to
further revelations of irregular trading practices by Japanese brokers.
Daiwa dropped Y65 to Y775 and Nomura Securities Y90 to Y1,160.
Bio-technology issues were mixed, with short-term traders active. Okamoto,
the leading prophylactic maker and the most active issue of the day,
retreated Y30 to Y1,300, and Mochida Pharmaceutical weakened Y170 to Y4,260.
However, Morinaga Milk advanced Y26 to Y736 on reports that the company is
planning clinical tests for a new drug.
In Osaka, the OSE average declined 194 points to 22,054.60 in volume of 166m
shares.
Roundup
THE PACIFIC Rim ignored Tokyo's weakness, as the Hong Kong market achieved
yet another all-time high.
HONG KONG surged in heavy trading to a new record, easily rising above the
5,000 level on stronger than expected earnings by HSBC Holdings. The Hang
Seng index climbed 87.01 or 1.8 per cent to 5,005.96, its seventh record
high in the last two weeks. Turnover nearly doubled to HKDollars 3.21bn from
HKDollars 1.69bn.
Banks showed the day's best gains, paced by HSBC Holdings, which moved ahead
HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 44.00, with HKDollars 445m worth of shares
changing hands. Late on Tuesday HSBC announced that 1991 profits were up 83
per cent, better than most forecasts.
SEOUL was depressed by a decline in large manufacturing and financial
shares. The composite index finished 8.97 down at 619.05. Volume contracted
to Won218bn from Won264.8bn. The market was closed on Tuesday.
News that cash deposits with securities houses had fallen to Won1.5 trillion
(million million) on Monday weighed on the market. Subsidiaries of the giant
Hyundai Group, however, advanced on bargain hunting.
NEW ZEALAND was helped by a firmer New York market. The NZSE-40 index closed
at 1,466.66, up 5.42, as turnover fell to NZDollars 13.8m (NZDollars 20.3m).
AUSTRALIA was also lifted by Wall Street. The All Ordinaries index improved
3.8 to 1,609.1 in turnover of ADollars 173m, up from ADollars 150m.
News Corp added 54 cents at ADollars 18.24 as analysts reassessed the stock
following news that its BSkyB unit was breaking even. BTR Nylex receded 4
cents to ADollars 2.35 after reporting a 41 per cent fall in annual
operating profit.
MANILA gained ground on a partial recovery in Philippine Long Distance
Telephone overnight on the American Stock Exchange. The composite index put
on 3.32 to 1,120.03 as turnover expanded to 34m pesos from 18m pesos.
SINGAPORE rose sharply but in thin volume. The Straits Times Industrial
index ended 15.00 higher at 1,447.67 in turnover of SDollars 81.3m, after
SDollars 68.1m.
Keppel Corp finished 25 cents ahead at SDollars 7.70 on volume of 332,000
shares amid talk of a rights issue.
KUALA LUMPUR ended modestly higher in light trading. The composite index
gained 1.41 at 588.36 in turnover of MDollars 78.9m (MDollars 91.5m).
TAIWAN advanced but trading remained light due to continued political
uncertainty. The weighted index climbed 39.28 to 4,965.48 as turnover rose
moderately to TDollars 19.44bn.
BOMBAY fell sharply for the second day as state-owned investment
institutions continued to sell shares. The BSE index closed at 3,163.68,
down 152.35 or 4.6 per cent.
