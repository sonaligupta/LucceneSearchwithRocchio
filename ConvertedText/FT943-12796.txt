FT  22 JUL 94 / International Company News: Monsanto beats expectations


   By RICHARD WATERS


   NEW YORK


After-tax profits at Monsanto, the US chemicals group, climbed 29 per cent
in the second quarter of the year. Its chemicals group benefited from the
economic upswing in the US and Searle, its drugs company, shook off losses
from the year before.
Net income of Dollars 258m, or Dollars 2.19 a share, was ahead of market
expectations and compared with Dollars 200m, or Dollars 1.66 a year ago.
In the chemicals area, Monsanto's operating profits rose to Dollars 103m
from Dollars 75m on sales down to Dollars 926m from Dollars 933m, thanks
mainly to demand in the US automotive, housing and home furnishing markets.
Searle, which reported a Dollars 37m operating loss a year ago, returned a
Dollars 3m profit in the latest quarter on a 9 per cent improvement in
sales, to Dollars 415m. The sales growth came from Ambien, an insomnia drug,
and Daypro and Arthrotec, two treatments for arthritis.
For the six months as a whole, net income rose to Dollars 452m on sales of
Dollars 4.3bn, from Dollars 341m on sales of Dollars 4.2bn a year before.
Warner Lambert saw its drugs sales fall by 3 per cent in the second quarter,
although sales overall grew by 7 per cent to Dollars 1.55bn on strong gains
from consumer products, particularly in the US.
The lower pharmaceutical sales were due to a 9 per cent fall in the US as
Lopid, a lipid drug, faced competition from generic alternatives on the
expiry of its patent.
Net income of Dollars 197m, up from Dollars 190m a year before, and earnings
per share of Dollars 1.47, up from Dollars 1.40, were broadly in line with
market expectations. For the half year, Warner Lambert recorded net income
of Dollars 387m on sales of Dollars 3bn, compared with Dollars 372m on sales
of Dollars 2.8bn.
