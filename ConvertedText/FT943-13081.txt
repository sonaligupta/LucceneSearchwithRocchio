FT  21 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Egypt gives approval to privately run oil
refinery


   By REUTER


   CAIRO


The Egyptian government has approved a private-sector plan to build an oil
refinery and petrochemical plant near Suez, Reuter reports from Cairo.
A group of Egyptian and Kuwaiti investors, operating as the Sahara Company
for Petroleum Products, plan to spend about Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 769m) on
the refinery, which would probably use Saudi or Kuwaiti crude and refine
products for export, oil minister Hamdi el-Banbi said yesterday.
Plans to build a separate private-sector refinery of about the same size on
the Mediterranean coast west of Alexandria were more advanced than those for
the Suez one.
