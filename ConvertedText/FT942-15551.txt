FT  14 APR 94 / International Company News: Heineken to step up Asia
investment


   By RONALD VAN DE KROL

Heineken, the Dutch brewer, plans to take advantage of the swift growth of
beer markets in Asia with an 'aggressive' programme of investment in the
region.
Asia Pacific Breweries (APB), the company's Singapore-based joint venture
with Fraser & Neave, expects to spend Fl 800m (Dollars 417m) on Asian
investments over the next five years. This is nearly four times the Fl 220m
invested over the past five years.
Mr Karel Vuursteen, Heineken chairman, said Asian beer markets were growing
at spectacular rates, with China showing a 20 per cent increase last year.
He said the company was planning three or four new brewery projects in China
over the next two years. APB, Heineken's investment vehicle for Asia,
already owns parts of breweries in Shanghai and Fuzhou. In recent years, it
has also been active in Vietnam and Thailand.
In 1993, Heineken's strong growth in Asia and in the US made up for a
downturn on European beer markets, which still account for 75 per cent of
group turnover. Last month, Heineken, the world's second-largest brewer,
reported a 12 per cent increase in 1993 net profit before extraordinary
items, to Fl 519m.
Figures contained in the annual report, released yesterday, showed an 0.8
per cent fall in Dutch sales and a 2 per cent drop in European sales last
year. These declines were more than outweighed by a 5.3 per cent rise in the
western hemisphere, and a sharp 23.7 per cent gain in Asia/Australia.
Mr Vuursteen said Heineken had recently reached a 'satisfactory' arrangement
with Vereenigde Glasfabrieken, a bottle manufacturer which supplied Heineken
with flawed bottles that had to be recalled in August.
