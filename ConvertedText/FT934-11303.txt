FT  02 NOV 93 / Turkish officials to urge Syria to curb activities of
guerrillas

   ANKARA


Three Turkish officials will go to Damascus this week to urge Syria to curb
the activities of guerrillas battling for a separate Kurdish state in
Turkey, Reuter reports from Ankara.
Turkey has long urged Syria to help prevent cross-border infiltration by
Kurdistan Workers' party (PKK) rebels fighting a secessionist struggle in
south-east Turkey.
Prime Minister Tansu Ciller last week accused Syria, Iraq, Iran and Armenia
of allowing the PKK to use their territory and said she would pursue
diplomatic efforts to persuade them to desist. Syria says it regards the PKK
as an illegal organisation and arrests its members when it finds them.
