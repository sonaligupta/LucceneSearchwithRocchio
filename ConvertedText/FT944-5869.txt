FT  01 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Enviromed advances


A strong contribution from acquisitions helped Enviromed, the biotechnology
and healthcare group, to achieve a fourfold increase in pre-tax profits from
Pounds 546,000 to Pounds 2.21m in the year to end-September.
Of the advance, Pounds 1.21m came from two acquisitions made during the
period.
Turnover grew from Pounds 5.3m to Pounds 8.52m, bolstered by Pounds 2.49m
from acquisitions. Earnings came out at 7.85p (7.13p).
A final dividend of 1.4p is proposed, making a total for the year of 1.6p.
Since the year end Enviromed has expanded via the Pounds 7.42m acquisition
of F&H Baxter (Holdings), a dental equipment and supplies company.
