FT  12 MAR 92 / International Company News: Deutsche Babcock to float units

DEUTSCHE Babcock, the hard-pressed plant and engineering group, is to float
three subsidiaries on the German stock market as part of an attempt to
retain its independence, Mr Heyo Schmiedeknecht, chairman, said.
The company had to improve value to shareholders and persuade them not to
sell at current low prices.
These were 'an invitation' for someone to consider a bid, he said yesterday.
The group believed up to 20 per cent of its stock had changed hands
recently.
Downgrading profit forecasts for the current year, which ends September 30,
Mr Schmiedeknecht said he did not expect to be able to pay a dividend until
1993/94. The last payout, of DM4 a share, was made in 1989.
The company made net profits of DM32m (Dollars 20m) last year after a DM81m
loss in 1989/90. This year's result, earlier expected to be at least DM80m,
would now be between DM30m and DM40m, he said.
Order developments in the first five months of the year had made the company
more cautious. Power plant orders had slumped and the group was now
negotiating possible joint ventures in east European countries in the hope
of bolstering earnings from the sale of know-how.
Subsidiaries being prepared for flotation were Balcke-Durr, Babcock-BGH and
Schumag, specialists in mechanical engineering, plant and industrial
technology.
Group sales rose 26 per cent to DM7.3bn in 1990/91, but almost all the
growth came from recently purchased companies.
