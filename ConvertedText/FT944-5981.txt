FT  01 DEC 94 / Manufacturers hit by price rises


   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff


Price pressures are increasing in manufacturing, with more businesses
reporting rising material costs, the Purchasing Managers index from the
Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply suggested yesterday.
This month the seasonally adjusted price index rose to its highest level in
its three-year history. The findings for November are likely to fuel City
concerns that inflation may begin to rise again.
But with surveys such as the purchasing index painting a slightly different
picture from the pattern seen in recent official government data, economists
are increasingly at odds about which indicators are providing the best guide
to future inflation trends.
In recent months the Bank of England has been expanding the list of
indicators it uses to assess inflationary pressures, to include not only
monetary aggregates but also factors such as commodity prices.
This week's Budget indicated that the Treasury was also paying closer
attention to a broader scope of data because the Red Book cited for the
first time wage costs and material input prices as factors that would
influence interest rate decisions.
Some City analysts - such as Mr Robert Barry, economist at brokers BZW  -
believe that this implies that the monetary authorities are giving greater
weight to business surveys.
Although the purchasing index has not yet achieved the credibility of the US
purchasing managers index, the pricing component of the Confederation of
British Industry survey is being closely watched by the Bank of England.
Other City institutions are now exploring ways to measure inflation through
a composite index - rather than through single indicators. The Chartered
Institute of Purchasing and Supply has said that it will launch a new index
of leading indicators of inflation next month.
In September Goldman Sachs, the investment bank, launched the first leading
inflation indicators in the City.
Although the Bank of England and Treasury have no plans as yet to introduce
their own leading indicators, officials say they are watching the
developments 'with great interest'.
Part of the reason for the new interest in composite indicators is that
different surveys and data have been diverging slightly in recent months.
Yesterday's purchasing index suggested that input prices rose quickly in
November, after a strong increase in October. This broadly tallies with the
CBI's survey, which showed that a growing number of businesses planned to
raise output prices, partly in response to rising raw material costs.
Nevertheless, recent Central Statistical Office data has suggested that
price pressures are more muted, with the pace of monthly growth in input and
output prices slowing in October.
One reason for the discrepancy may be sectoral differences. The purchasing
index survey shows that the chemicals sector is reporting much faster prices
than other sectors.
Mr Chris Williamson of NTC research, which compiles the data, suggested that
another reason might be that the purchasing index data included prices paid
by domestic manufacturers for purchases from other manufacturers, while the
CSO data netted out transactions from one sector to another.
A third factor that might affect the CSO data is that companies tend to
report list prices to the government, rather than actual prices.
The discounting that occurred in the recession might not have been recorded
 -and conversely the reduction in price discounting that purchasing managers
might now be reporting as the economy recovered was also not always
reflected.
Reported output rose slightly last month, and delivery times lengthened,
suggesting that capacity problems might be developing in some sectors.

A reading of the Purchasing Managers' Index below 50% indicates that
the manufacturing economy is generally declining, above 50% that it is
generally expanding.
