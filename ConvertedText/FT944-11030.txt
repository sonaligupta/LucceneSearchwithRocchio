FT  08 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Woodchester Invs


Woodchester Investments and Credit Lyonnais, the French banking group which
has a 53 per cent stake in the Dublin-based leasing and banking concern, are
reorganising their joint continental European leasing operations.
Woodchester is exchanging its 30 per cent holding in Credit Lyonnais Leasing
Europe for the Credit Lyonnais Group's 80 per cent holding in Slibail
Portuguesa - Companhia de Locacao Financeira and 100 per cent shareholding
in Credit Lyonnais Finans Danmark, together with a cash payment to
Woodchester by Credit Lyonnais of FFr96.2m (Pounds 11.4m). Both companies
are controlled by CLLE.
Woodchester is also selling its remaining 30 per cent holding in Woodchester
Trade Finance to Credit Lyonnais for Pounds 1m, equivalent to Woodchester's
share of its net assets at September 30. The move is in line with
Woodchester's aim of withdrawing from non-core activities.
Woodchester is proposing to adopt a twin share scheme, to enable the payment
of a dividend with a lower tax credit to be made. This will help cut its
advance corporation tax liability significantly.
