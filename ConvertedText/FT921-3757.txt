FT  12 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Standard Chartered


There is an air of anti-climax about Standard Chartered. Though its 1991
results were tarnished by a Pounds 36m retrospective tax provision for Union
Bank of California, the main picture is of a bank finally on the way to
recovery. Unfortunately, healthy is also revealed as dull.
Rising costs have taken the sparkle off the abnormally wide interest margins
in Hong Kong last year. Net interest income remains depressed by the
suspension of payments by UK problem borrowers. Provisions may not be on the
scale of the other UK clearers, but that leaves less scope for profits to
bounce. The shares will hardly out-perform much longer: they have risen 40
per cent against the sector during the last six months.
