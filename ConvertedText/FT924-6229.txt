President Francois Mitterand has suffered a fall in public approval due to
the controversy over France's unpopular new anti-smoking laws and the
involvement of senior socialist politicians in the AIDS blood scandal,
writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris.
The French president's approval rating has slipped from 31 per cent to 29
per cent over the past month, according to an IFOP opinion poll published in
yesterday's Journal du Dimanche newspaper. This means Mr Mitterand has
returned to the low level of approval that haunted him this time last year.
