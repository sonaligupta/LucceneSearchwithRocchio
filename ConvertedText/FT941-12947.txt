FT  27 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Earnings data help Dow pick
up after slide

Wall Street
After recording its biggest loss of the year in the previous session, the
Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied yesterday in response to solid
corporate earnings and firmer bond prices, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
By the close the Dow was 12.66 ahead at 3,908.00, while the Standard &
Poor's 500 improved 2.28 to 473.20. The American SE composite was 1.15
better at 481.74 and the Nasdaq composite gained 2.41 at 788.80. NYSE volume
was heavy, at 304.6m shares.
The negative tone which surfaced on Tuesday carried over to yesterday's
opening. No fresh economic readings were available to sway sentiment, and
early activity in the US Treasury market was light and convictionless.
Later, bond prices struggled into positive territory, and by late afternoon
the benchmark 30-year government bond was  13/32 higher at 98 5/32 , with
the yield easing to 6.308 per cent.
But it was corporate earnings that captured the most attention. Among the
cyclical issues that were hit by profit-taking the previous day, Bethlehem
Steel rebounded Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 22 1/4 on news of a strong fourth
quarter. Caterpillar, up Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 99 1/4 , Sears, Dollars 1
7/8 ahead at Dollars 53 7/8 , and Procter & Gamble, Dollars 1 firmer at
Dollars 58 5/8 , also contributed to the Dow's advance.
Among the index's other component stocks, Philip Morris confirmed
expectations of lower operating income because of cigarette pricing cuts.
But improvements by other facets of its business lifted the shares Dollars 1
3/8 to Dollars 59 1/4 .
Owens-Corning Fiberglass advanced Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 41 7/8 after
Merrill Lynch reaffirmed its favourable rating on the stock in anticipation
of solid results in the final 1993 quarter.
American Express slipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 32 1/8 on profit-taking
after Tuesday's gain, but most banking issues were up sharply. Citicorp
jumped Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 41 1/8 , Chase Manhattan Dollars 1 1/8 to
Dollars 35 1/4 , JP Morgan Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 69 3/4 and Bankers Trust
Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 80 1/2 .
Scott Paper's plans to reduce its worldwide workforce by 25 per cent pushed
the shares up Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 45 1/2 in heavy trading.
Technology stocks were particularly active, but investors were unimpressed
by Compaq, which beat forecasts with record fourth-quarter earnings and
sales. Its share price fell Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 80 7/8 . Advanced Micro
Devices put on Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 20 5/8 after Compaq revealed plans to
begin buying AMD microchips.
International Business Machines, down Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 56 3/8 ,
continued to slide amid uncertainty over its 1994 prospects.
Lotus Development rose Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 55 5/8 after a doubling of
net income in the final three months of 1993. But the positive sentiment
failed to lift other Nasdaq technology issues. Intel shed Dollars 1 3/8 to
Dollars 63 5/8 . Canada
Toronto stocks snapped a four-day losing streak, ending slightly higher
after active trading. The TSE 300 index rose 4.0 to 4,460.3 and advances
outscored falls by 409 to 368 after volume of 71.2m shares.
Gold, transportation and real estate stocks led the way, all posting index
gains of more than 1 per cent. Industrial products fell 1.19 per cent.
PWA surged 30 cents to CDollars 1.50 on news that Air Canada, up CDollars
1/2 at CDollars 6, will discontinue all litigation that would prevent PWA
from completing a proposed partnership with AMR.
