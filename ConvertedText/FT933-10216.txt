After the discrediting of the welfare state in the last few years, it would
be no great surprise to hear politicians calling for the reinstatement of
the Magdalen Institutes. In these houses for 'fallen women', founded in the
19th century, the inmates worked in laundries to earn their keep. In the
BBC2 documentary Washing Away The Stain (7.30) one inhabitant says: 'We
never got paid for any of the work . . . but we did get a cake of highland
toffee on a Sunday.'
The following programme, Business Matters (8.00) looks at the work of Robert
Schaffer who claims that most organisations perform at a fraction of their
true capabilities. Two examples where performance has been improved -
Wandsworth Borough Council and Betterware - are investigated.
BBC Proms - Live from the Albert Hall on BBC1 and Radio 3 (10.00) features
the Virtuosi di Roma playing music by Boccherini and Vivaldi.
Let's hope Deborah Kermode's documentary about budding comedians in the
series Metroland is as good as last week's about vans and their drivers
(10.40 ITV).
