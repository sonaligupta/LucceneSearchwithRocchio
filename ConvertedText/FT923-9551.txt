FT  05 AUG 92 / International Company News: Berlitz in talks over possible
takeover


   By ALAN FRIEDMAN


   NEW YORK


BERLITZ, the language school subsidiary of the Maxwell Communication
Corporation (MCC) that discovered a majority of its shares were pledged
improperly last year to banks as collateral by the late Mr Robert Maxwell,
said last night it was talks with bidders interested in a possible takeover.
The Princeton-based Berlitz also unveiled its second-quarter net profit of
Dollars 2.9m, down from Dollars 5.9m in the same period of last year.
Revenues in the quarter were Dollars 72.6m, up from Dollars 66m a year ago.
For the first six months of 1992, Berlitz made Dollars 7.3m net income, down
from Dollars 11.8m in the first half of 1991. Revenues for the first half of
1992 were 7.8 per cent improved at Dollars 140.9m.
MCC is currently operating under Chapter 11 of US bankruptcy law in a
complex trans-Atlantic arrangement that requires co-ordination between New
York and UK court-appointed adminis-trators.
At present, most of the 56.5 per cent Berlitz stake that was nominally owned
by Macmillan - the US publisher that was itself owned by MCC - is actually
in the hands of five banks and companies that received the stock as
collateral for loans to Mr Maxwell. Berlitz, however, said it no longer
considered itself to be part of MCC.
Berlitz said it had retained Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette to advise it on a
possible merger, but the company stressed no agreement had yet been reached.
The news nonetheless cheered Wall Street, which marked the Berlitz share
price up by Dollars 1 1/2 , to Dollars 21, a 52-week high.
