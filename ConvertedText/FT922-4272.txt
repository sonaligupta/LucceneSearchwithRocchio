FT  06 JUN 92 / UK Company News: British Gas closes computer software arm


   By ANDREW JACK


AN EMBARRASSED British Gas has turned out the pilot light at a computer
software subsidiary it founded two years ago which only managed to win two
outside customers despite hiring up to 70 staff and making a substantial
investment.
Information Architechs, originally established as Quadrant Software
Services, was created to market what it believed would be a highly
profitable computer-aided software engineering (Case) package developed by
its employees in the north of England.
British Gas did not release a public statement about the closure and played
down its significance with a short official comment when quizzed yesterday.
It said the company was to cease trading after being hit badly by the
recession.
In the accounts ending March 31 last year, it showed losses of Pounds 1.69m.
British Gas said this year's losses would be up to Pounds 5m including
winding-up costs.
Information Architechs grew ambitiously by opening offices in London and
Windsor, and established a research and development centre in Leeds. It
announced last year that it expected to win 20 per cent of the Case market
by 1995.
But its only clients have been Mercantile & General, the re-insurance
company, Clackmannan District Council in Scotland and the north-east region
of British Gas itself. Since its creation, British Gas had also been buying
products from one of its competitors.
Its operating costs rose rapidly and new management was brought in earlier
this year. But sales staff were being recruited recently on a basic salary
of Pounds 40,000 a year.
Mr Steuart Lauchlan, a journalist with Computing magazine who observed
Information Architechs, said: 'It behaved like a company that had been
around five or six years, spending money on extravagant gestures but not on
winning customers. The bottom line is it was a bit arrogant.'
