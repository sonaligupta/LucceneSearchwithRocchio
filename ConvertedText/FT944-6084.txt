FT  30 NOV 94 / Unit trust investment falls again


   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU


Investment in unit trusts last month fell for the second consecutive month
this year to a net Pounds 302.2m, almost 36 per cent lower than September's
figure of Pounds 470.7m and the lowest monthly investment figure this year.
Institutions were net sellers of unit trusts last month but retail investors
bought a net Pounds 330.9m, of which almost 75 per cent - Pounds 245.6m -
was in the form of tax-free personal equity plans.
Mr Philip Warland, director-general of the Association of Unit Trusts and
Investment Funds, said he was not surprised by the low sales. He attributed
it to an unattractive stock market performance and a faster rise in consumer
spending than in earnings, leaving people with less money to save.
'The counteracting influence is the continuing Pep sales, where regular
savings plans and sales direct to the public and through sales forces are
growing in importance,' he added.
Retail investors continued to invest in less risky funds and those offering
income. The most popular last month were fund of funds, UK general, UK
growth and UK equity income. The least favoured markets were North America
and Europe.
