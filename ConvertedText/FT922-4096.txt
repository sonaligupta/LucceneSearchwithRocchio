FT  08 JUN 92 / Divisions show in Scottish opposition


   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent


OPPOSITION parties in Scotland presented a disunited front at the weekend. A
demonstration against the Conservatives failed to attract the degree of
support expected, and Mr Malcolm Bruce, departing leader of the Scottish
Liberal Democrats, admitted to strategic errors in the run up-to the general
election.
About 3,000 people took part in a march ending in a rally outside the Tory
party's Scottish headquarters in Edinburgh on Saturday. It was organised by
Scotland United, a fringe grouping from the non-Conservative Scottish
parties set up immediately after the general election to campaign for a
multi-option referendum on the country's constitutional future.
The attendance was no more than those of the first two Scotland United
rallies in Glasgow in April.
At a one-day conference in Dunfermline, the Scottish Liberal Democrats voted
not to join Scotland United. Instead they aim to improve the proposals for
constitutional reform worked out by the Scottish Constitutional Convention,
a grouping mainly of Labour and Liberal Democrats.
Mr Malcolm Bruce, MP for Gordon, who stepped down as Scottish leader after
the party's disappointing showing in Scotland in the election, said the
party had made a mistake in becoming too close to Labour in the convention.
'We gave Labour a respectability; we compromised on radicalism and did not
achieve advances,' he said.
Mr Jim Wallace, the MP for Orkney and Shetland who was elected party leader,
said the Liberal Democrats should develop their policy of seeking a federal
constitution for Britain which would be harder for the Conservatives to
oppose than the devolution of power to Scotland alone.
