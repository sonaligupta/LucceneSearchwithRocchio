FT  03 AUG 92 / Letter (3): Devaluation, a common currency and the answer to
Britain's current account deficit


   From Prof BRIAN TEW


Sir, Walter Eltis states that 'the devaluers appear oblivious to the
possibility that a persistent trade deficit can be macroeconomic in origin,
so that only reductions in net borrowing by the private sector or government
can cure it', which implies that a cut in government expenditure would
reduce the UK's trade deficit. Such is undoubtedly the case, but the causal
route by which this 'remedy' would work is unfortunately via an aggravation
of the present recession. If government expenditure is cut, national income
falls and goes on falling until income receivers are sufficiently
impoverished for the consequential reduction in their saving plus tax
payment plus purchases of imports to balance, in aggregate, the reduction in
government expenditure.
It is in this way that Mr Eltis's equality between 'an excess of investment
over saving' and the 'automatic' trade deficit will be achieved. Not
surprisingly, devaluers do not favour the prescription, though their own,
too, would undoubtedly have unwanted side effects.
