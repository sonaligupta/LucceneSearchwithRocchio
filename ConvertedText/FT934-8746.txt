FT  13 NOV 93 / Markets: Hong Kong shares keep on climbing - At a glance


HONG KONG had another good week with the Hang Seng index pushing upwards to
close last night at 9,701.25, a rise of nearly 8 per cent over the week. The
increase can be traced back to bullish comments about China by Morgan
Stanley, the US securities firm, after a visit to China by a group of US
fund managers in September. Hong Kong is seen as the investment gateway to
China and US fund managers have been switching money away from unexciting US
and European markets to Asia.
