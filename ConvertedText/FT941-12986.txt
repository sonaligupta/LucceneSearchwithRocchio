NTT, the Japanese telecommunications group, is investing in General Magic, a
California company which develops software for 'digital agents'.
Digital agents will provide users of computerised devices with assistance in
finding information, performing routine tasks, alerting them to news or
events that need their attention, sending or receiving messages.
NTT joins Apple Computer, the US personal computer company, AT&T, the
telecommunications company, Motorola, the US electronics manufacturer,
Matsushita and Sony of Japan and Philips of the Netherlands, as General
Magic investors and technology licensees. The companies are each separately
developing products and services based on communications software developed
by General Magic.
NTT is expected to develop 'intelligent agent-based communications services
based on General Magic technology,' said Mr Mark Porat, General Magic chief
executive.
For General Magic, NTT's investment increases the possibility that the US
company's technology will become an industry standard and kick-start the
market for hand-held 'personal communicators'.
General Magic is also in talks with leading European telecommunications
companies, said Mr Porat. International Business Machines has also expressed
interest in General Magic's technology, he added. General Magic's goal is to
establish its technology as a standard for a new generation of
communications devices and services.
