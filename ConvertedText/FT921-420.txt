FT  30 MAR 92 / Albanians' run-off polls


   By AP


   TIRANA


ALBANIANS voted yesterday in 11 run-off elections that the Democratic party,
already assured of overall victory, hopes will bolster support in the
once-Communist south of the nation, AP reports from Tirana.
State radio reported no incidents as voting proceeded in the run-off races,
all in the south or centre of Europe's poorest country.
The Democrats captured 79 of 89 seats in first-round elections a week ago.
The Socialists, formerly called the Communists, won only six seats.
Four other seats went to smaller parties that could prove crucial to the
Democrats' goal of unseating President Ramiz Alia, the successor to
Stalinist dictator Enver Hoxha in 1985 and the last ex-Communist left in
power.
