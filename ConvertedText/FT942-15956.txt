FT  13 APR 94 / World Trade News: Sutherland challenged over 'winners' claim


   By FRANCES WILLIAMS


   MARRAKESH


Aid agencies yesterday challenged the robust assertion by Mr Peter
Sutherland, Gatt director-general, on Monday that all countries would gain
from the Uruguay Round trade accords.
Mr Peter Madden, of London-based Christian Aid, said there was general
agreement by economists that there would be losers, at least in the short
term, while the long- term benefits were uncertain. African and Caribbean
countries stand to be worst affected.
Christian Aid is calling for additional assistance to compensate those made
worse off, by way of debt relief, aid to take advantage of market
opportunities and the granting of new trade preferences.
Ministers in Marrakesh for this week's signing of the Uruguay Round deal are
due to approve a decision calling for extra help for poor net food-importing
countries, who may face higher food bills as western export subsidies are
reduced. But Mr Madden said this did not go far enough.
A World Bank/OECD study published last year put the losses for all Africa at
Dollars 2.6bn annually after 10 years, while internal World Bank estimates
suggest transitional costs could persist for 15 years.
Christian Aid identifies the losers as falling into four categories: net
food importers; countries now benefiting from trade preferences, notably
under the Lome Convention with the European Union; commodity exporters; and
those too underdeveloped to take advantage of new trading opportunities.
