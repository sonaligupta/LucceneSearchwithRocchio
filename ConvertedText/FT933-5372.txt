FT  03 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Trencherwood moves back into the black
after exceptionals


THE EFFECTS of an exceptional credit together with the sale proceeds of a
subsidiary enabled USM-quoted Trencherwood, the Newbury-based housebuilder,
to move Pounds 1.82m back into the black at the pre-tax level for the half
year ended April 30.
These credits, totalling Pounds 3.45m, related primarily to adjustments
resulting from the refinancing of the company approved by shareholders in
February.
The pre-tax profit, which compared with a previous deficit of Pounds 16.4m,
also reflected a Pounds 2m reduction in interest costs to Pounds 1.22m.
Turnover for the half year totalled Pounds 4.8m (Pounds 9.63m). However,
since January the company had seen a marked improvement in purchaser
confidence which in turn had fed through to increased sales.
The directors were 'encouraged' by the way the housing market had recovered
in west Berkshire and noted that so far, the recovery had been sustained.
They added that Trencherwood remained on course to achieve a return to
profitability during 1994.
In April, planning consent was granted for the construction of a food
superstore for J Sainsbury on land principally owned and controlled by an
associate company. It was pointed out that the sale of the land should make
a significant contribution to cash flow this year.
Borrowings at the period end amounted to Pounds 25.8m (Pounds 48.2m).
Undiluted earnings per share emerged at 3.74p against losses of 65.6p.
