FT  16 MAR 94 / Carsberg rebuffs credit card industry


   By ALISON SMITH


Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, is to hold a public
hearing in September on whether there should be a change in the law on
credit card issuers.
At present, where goods or services paid for by a credit card are not
delivered or are misrepresented, issuers are liable for transactions.
The removal of credit providers' joint and several liability was one of the
recommendations from the de-regulation task forces set up by the Department
of Trade and Industry.
While the Credit Card Research Group, financed by the credit card industry,
welcomed the public hearing, Sir Bryan rejected the card issuers' argument
that the law was unclear and emphasised that card issuers would be breaking
their obligations under the consumer credit act if they refused to meet
legitimate claims.
He also signalled that he was far from convinced of the need for change. 'I
should certainly find it difficult to recommend a change in the law towards
a 'second-in-line' approach without clear agreement by all card issuers as
to the extent, particularly for overseas transactions, beyond which it would
not be reasonably practicable for consumers to go in pursuit of a defaulting
supplier before they could seek redress from a card issuer standing
'second-in-line'.'
The research group argued that the law gave less protection to people buying
goods using cheques or cash than to those using credit cards.
