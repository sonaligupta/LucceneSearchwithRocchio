FT  01 DEC 94 / Single market: could try harder


   By EMMA TUCKER

European Union member states must match their political commitment to the
single market with concrete action, by rapidly adopting outstanding
legislation and correctly applying those measures already agreed, Mr Raniero
Vanni D'Archirafi, commissioner responsible for the single market, said
yesterday. Presenting a report that will go to the heads of state meeting in
Essen next week, Mr Vanni D'Archirafi said: 'We're telling the European
council that the news on the single market is good, but must be improved.
The effects of the legislation adopted are beginning to feed through to the
market place but we cannot afford to rest on our laurels.' One of the
worries currently taxing the Commission is that harmonisation legislation,
designed to complete the internal market, is being badly transcribed on to
national statute books. Mr Vanni D'Archirafi said the council of ministers
had so far this year failed to make significant progress in the elimination
of border controls on people. Also in certain areas, adopted measures were
not being implemented in national legislation in accordance with the agreed
timetables and their application in practice leaves something to be desired.
