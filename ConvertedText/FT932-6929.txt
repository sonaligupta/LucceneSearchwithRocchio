FT  26 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Regional advertising helps Metro Radio rise


   By CHRIS TIGHE


METRO RADIO Group, the USM-quoted local radio station operator, reported
pre-tax profits up 19 per cent at Pounds 797,000 for the half year to March
31, against Pounds 670,000.
Local and regional advertising revenue was up 21 per cent but was offset by
a 10 per cent fall in national advertising revenue. Overall, advertising
revenue rose 11 per cent to Pounds 6.6m (Pounds 5.95m).
Mr John Josephs, managing director, blamed the national fall partly on the
receivership of Crown Communications, parent of Independent Radio Sales,
Metro's national sales agency. He hoped the sale of IRS, now under
negotiation, would resolve this problem.
Misplaced gloom among London-based clients about economic prospects outside
the south east was also a factor, he said.
Turnover rose by 15 per cent to Pounds 8m (Pounds 6.96m). Earnings per share
advanced 19 per cent to 3.13p (2.64p). The interim dividend is being
maintained at 1.5p.
He confirmed the Tyneside-based group was considering applying for the newly
advertised Scottish regional licence.
