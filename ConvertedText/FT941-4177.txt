FT  12 MAR 94 / Detained asylum seekers protest


   By EDWARD MORTIMER


More than 180 asylum seekers started an indefinite hunger-strike yesterday
at Campsfield detention centre, near Oxford, in protest at their detention
without trial or charge for periods of up to a year.
The centre, run by the Group 4 security company, opened in November to take
the overflow of detainees from Harmondsworth, near Heathrow Airport.
The centre has drawn protests from more than 100 Oxford dons, including 24
professors and 11 heads of colleges, who signed an open letter to Mr John
Major, the prime minister.
A hunger-strike by a group of Algerian detainees ended last weekend when
they were taken to a private psychiatric hospital in York and then released.
This time, all but a handful of the centre's 200 inmates have joined the
strike.
Mr Charles Wardle, immigration minister, said in a radio interview last week
that 'only a tiny proportion' of those seeking asylum were detained 'if they
don't comply with restrictions'.
Two detainees interviewed at Campsfield yesterday said they had been
detained on arrival in the country and had not been offered an option of
complying with restrictions.
