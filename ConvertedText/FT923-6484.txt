TELEBRAS, the state-owned telecommunications holding company, announced
profits of Dollars 354m for the first six months of 1992. In the whole of
1991, the company made Dollars 121.8m.
Last week, the government authorised Telebras to make a foreign equities
offering of Dollars 500m. The company is expected to make a private
placement of American Depository Receipts shortly.
Telebras also announced that it would increase domestic long distance and
base rates for subscribers by 30 per cent by the end of the year.
The new revenue should help Telebras meet its investment target of Dollars
3bn for the current year.
The Gerdau Group, Brazil's largest private steel producer, announced profits
of Dollars 29.5m for the first six months of this year.
Company officials said the result was 32.3 per cent better than that for the
same period in 1991. Overall, the group registered profits of Dollars 36m
last year.
Gerdau has been active in the government's privatisation auctions.
The company owns three steel mills once owned by the state. Most recently,
in February, it acquired Acos Finos Piratini for Dollars 107m, getting a
foothold in the specialised steel sector.
