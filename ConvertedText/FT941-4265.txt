FT  11 MAR 94 / International Company News: US foods group links with SA
producer


   By MATTHEW CURTIN


   JOHANNESBURG


CPC International, the US-based multinational foods group, has invested R92m
(Dollars 26.5m) in a joint venture with Tongaat-Hulett, the
Anglo-American-owned aluminium, sugar and foods producer. The deal marks the
biggest re-investment in South Africa since the lifting of American
sanctions.
It follows the return of a number of US companies to South Africa this year,
including International Business Machines and Kodak. Pilsbury, a rival US
foods group, set up a partnership with local producer FoodCorp last year,
and Heinz is understood to be investigating a South African partnership,
possibly with the Premier Group.
CPC has exercised its option to buy a 50 per cent stake in Tongaat's
consumer foods division. The option was part of a licensing and technology
agreement signed by the companies in October 1993. The new company - CPC
Tongaat Foods - will invest R10m in a new dry foods plant.
The deal is complicated by CPC's disinvestment from South Africa in 1987,
when it sold the rights to a number of its brands - including Knorr,
Hellmann's and Marmite - to Hunt Leuchars & Hepburn, a local foods supplier.
CPC Tongaat Foods will be restricted to marketing these brands outside South
Africa, Namibia and Botswana. However, it plans to introduce and produce the
rest of CPC's product range in South Africa for the local and sub-Saharan
export markets.
Mr Mohammed Wahby, vice-president of CPC Europe Consumer Foods, admitted
South Africa and many neighbouring countries faced severe political
troubles. However, he said: 'One should not wait for a solution to all
political problems before launching a sound business proposal.'
Mr Cedric Savage, managing director of Tongaat, said it was vital for South
Africans to establish joint ventures with international companies.
