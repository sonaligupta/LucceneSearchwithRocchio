FT  30 JAN 92 / Survey of Saudi Arabia (3): Eagerly awaited guidance - The
budget


   By ROGER MATTHEWS


NO financial event in the past few months was more eagerly awaited than the
publication of the budget for 1992. Announced at the end of December, it was
the traditionally sparse document with which Saudis have become familiar,
offering a minimum of information.
But in the absence of a budget last year because of the Gulf war it provided
the first official guidance since 1990 on how well the economy was
performing and, critically for the private sector, how much the government
was planning to spend.
In the only official analysis to accompany the figures, the Ministry of
Finance and National Economy said that the figures were evidence that Saudi
Arabia was undergoing 'a major economic revival.'
The business community seemed to concur. Expenditure has been set at Dollars
48.3bn, 27 per cent up on 1990 and the highest figure since 1985-86,
although still far below the Dollars 83.5bn budgeted in 1982-83. With
revenues estimated to reach Dollars 40.3bn, this left a shortfall of Dollars
8bn which the government said it had already arranged to cover through local
financing.
The projected deficit is Dollars 1.4bn greater than the figures that had
been projected in 1989 and 1990 but lower than during the recession when in
1987 the deficit had widened to more than Dollars 14bn. Since 1982, the last
time that the budget was in balance, Saudi Arabia will at the end of this
year have accumulated gross budget deficits of approximately Dollars 125bn.
No guidance is provided on how much of this remains outstanding.
Historically, the government has tended to overestimate expenditure while
being conservative about projecting revenue. Given the present weakness of
oil prices, the effect on demand of the mild northern hemisphere winter and
the re-entry of Kuwait to the oil export market, industry analysts accept as
reasonable the projected revenue figure of just over Dollars 40bn, although
they would be surprised if it turned out to be any higher.
More than a third of revenues, or some Dollars 14.5bn, has been earmarked
for defence and security. This does not include those arms deals which are
paid for in oil. The other big budget items are education (Dollars 8.3bn),
health (Dollars 3.26bn), transport and communications (Dollars 2.2bn) and
domestic subsidies (Dollars 1.9bn).
The largest single sectoral rise has been made in the education budget which
is up by Dollars 1.32bn. This underlines the huge expansion in the number of
students, now estimated to be about 3m, up from little more than 500,000 in
1967. University attendance has more than doubled in the past 10 years and
is forecast to continue growing at about 15 per cent a year.
Out of the Dollars 48.25bn budget total, the government offers one further
division, distinguishing between the Dollars 34.4bn which is allocated to
recurrent expenditure and the Dollars 13.9bn set aside for what are
described as special projects. It is this last figure to which the private
sector pays most attention, although the government offers no further
information about what those projects may be and how many of them are
military-related.
