AMERICAN Brands, the Connecticut-based consumer products company with large
tobacco interests, yesterday warned of lower first-half profits due to the
cigarette price war begun this month by its rival Philip Morris, writes
Nikki Tait in New York.
First-quarter profits, before accounting charges, edged up to Dollars
247.1m, from Dollars 245.2m a year earlier, on revenues of Dollars 3.74bn
down from Dollars 3.83bn.
