FT  16 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Colorvision pushed into the red


   By ROLAND RUDD


AN UNDERSTATEMENT of creditors led to Colorvision, the Liverpool-based
retailer of television and satellite systems, incurring an interim deficit
of Pounds 545,000 before tax.
The outcome for the six months to September 30 compared to profits of Pounds
148,000 last time. Following a change of year-end, the latest figures
comprise the second interim period for the 18 months to March 31 1992.
An exceptional debit of Pounds 808,000 was needed after payments made to
creditors, which had not been accounted for, came to light after the
accounts were computerised.
It then emerged that the head office had repeatedly, for more than a year,
paid out money owed to shops, for advertising on Colorvision's behalf for
example, without recording it.
Profits before exceptional items and taxation increased to Pounds 263,000
(Pounds 148,000) on turnover ahead from Pounds 17.6m to Pounds 24.1m.
Mr Neville Michaelson, chairman, said that during a period when national
markets in television and video recorder sales had fallen the company
continued to increase its market share.
Gross margins fell from 37.2 to 34.3 per cent as the group phased out
finance pur-chases in favour of cash purchases.
Colorvision has continued its expansion of retail outlets. It now has 80
compared to 77 at end-March 1991 and anticipates having 85 by the end of
March 1992.
Losses per share were 1.7p compared to earnings of 0.5p. A second interim
dividend of 3.1p is declared.
