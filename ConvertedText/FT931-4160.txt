FT  12 MAR 93 / Oftel criticised on BT link fees


   By ROBERT RICE


OFTEL, the telecommunications watchdog, is criticised today for failing to
establish fair terms for operators that are either connected to British
Telecommunications' network, or wish to be linked.
The National Audit Office, the government spending watchdog, says in its
first report on Oftel that its failure to establish fair terms is hampering
competition.
The office says Mercury Communications, BT's main competitor, and new
entrants to the market have complained that BT's interconnection charges,
which are determined by Oftel, are too high. Interconnection charges are
estimated to be worth more than Pounds 400m a year to BT.
Oftel is re-examining the interconnection agreement between Mercury and BT
and is expected to deliver its verdict soon. It is also exploring options
for accounting separation between different parts of BT's activities. The
aim would be to ensure that there is greater transparency of interconnection
charges and that BT charges itself on the same basis as its competitors.
The office says Oftel has had some success in using its pricing formula to
reduce the real cost of some telephone services. But these reductions have
largely benefited high-volume business customers rather than residential
customers.
A survey by the office of some of the 41,000 people who made representations
to Oftel in 1991 found a high level of dissatisfaction with the way BT had
dealt with their initial complaints. It also highlighted delays by Oftel in
processing complaints and the poor quality of the final explanation of the
outcome of cases.
The office says Oftel should use new powers under the 1992 Competition and
Service (Utilities) Act to seek consistency between operators' service
standards.

529. HMSO. Pounds 7.40.
