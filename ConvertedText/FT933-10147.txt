FT  05 AUG 93 / International Company News: Tax adjustment boosts Highveld
Steel returns

HIGHVELD Steel and Vanadium, a subsidiary of Anglo American Industrial
Corporation, increased first-half attributable earnings by 21 per cent from
R31m to R37.6m (Dollars 11.2m) after benefiting from a R10m deferred tax
adjustment.
Operating profit, however, fell to R34.07m from R35.9m despite a 6 per cent
increase in turnover to R737.4m, reflecting the difficult market conditions.
The interim dividend was maintained at 20 cents a share on a 21 per cent
increase in earnings per share to 42.5 cents, from 35.1 cents.
Mr Leslie Boyd, chairman, said an end to inventory corrections by steel
stockists and new projects had helped local steel sales increase by nearly
10 per cent over the same period in 1992.
Although world steel consumption is forecast to fall this year, prices
continue to improve, and all of Highveld's ironmaking furnaces were brought
back into production.
Mr Boyd predicted that firmer dollar prices for export steel and ferro-alloy
products, and a weaker rand, should allow a 'moderate' increase in
second-half earnings over the first six months.
The vanadium market, however, continues to be difficult. Prices have fallen
to a level last seen during the recessionary period of 1982-83.
This is the result of lower consumption, exacerbated by the entry of Russian
producers at costs 'unrelated to western costs'. Highveld, the world's
largest vanadium producer, has closed its Vantra vanadium pentoxide plant.
It is unlikely to open again before the fourth quarter.
The Rand Carbide and Transalloys divisions continued to operate below
capacity, though the outlook is now more positive, while sales at the Rheem
division were lower than in 1992.
