FT  30 JAN 92 / Engineering employers take hard line on pay


   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES


GERMAN engineering employers went on the offensive yesterday with a claim
that workers should be prepared to accept a reduction in real incomes this
year.
Pay awards had to be related to productivity, expected to increase by 2.5
per cent, and not inflation, forecast to average 4.5 per cent, according to
Mr Dieter Hundt, president of the Baden-Wurttemberg metal industries
employers' association (VMI).
Speaking in Stuttgart, he called for a change of course in pay policy, and
said the 9.5 per cent claim from the IG Metall union greatly worsened the
prospects for a peaceful solution to this year's negotiations.
The VMI, which employs 700,000, is traditionally the first engineering
employers' group to start pay talks. This year's round begins on March 17.
IG Metall represents around 4m workers in manufacturing industry, which has
seen domestic orders tail off and low overseas demand.
