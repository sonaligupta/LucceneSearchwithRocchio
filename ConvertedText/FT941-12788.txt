FT  28 JAN 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Good vibrations from virtual
reality


   By RICHARD ROSEN


The day of the virtual reality one-piece body suit has moved a step closer
with the unveiling of the Interactor body vest, writes Richard Rosen.
Interactor, from Aura Systems, is the world's first system to mimic feeling
as well as vision and sound. The user puts on a body harness, which is
connected to a games console, television, or stereo to receive the sound.
This triggers a magnetic actuator which causes body pulsing vibrations; in
effect, it turns the body into a loudspeaker cone.
A volume adjustor allows the user to adjust the intensity of the vibrations.
Used with a computer game it translates into a buffeting as the player hits
and is hit by the opponent. Interactor is due to be launched in the US in
April at under Dollars 90. Aura Systems: US, 310 643 5300
