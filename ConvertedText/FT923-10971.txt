FT  28 JUL 92 / Directors 'shy' on pay disclosure


FEW BRITISH companies disclose details of their directors' pay packages, an
analysis by Company Reporting, the accounts monitoring service showed
yesterday.
Only 10 per cent disclose the amount paid to directors in bonuses and just 3
per cent show how these bonuses are calculated, in spite of the recent
recommendations on greater disclosure from the Cadbury Committee on
corporate governance.
Company Reporting, 68 Dundas St, Edinburgh EH3 6QZ, Pounds 315 per year.
