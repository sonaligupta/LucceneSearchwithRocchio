FT  11 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading


   By JOEL KIBAZO


A SQUEEZE in stock index futures helped to enliven an otherwise quiet day in
the derivatives market, as dealers once again waited for news of interest
rate cuts in tomorrow's Autumn Statement, writes Joel Kibazo.
The first trade in the December contract on the FT-SE was struck at 2,721,
an opening stronger than anticipated. But that early strength proved
temporary as December quickly went into reverse, falling to 2,713 by 9.15am,
the session's low point.
A mid-morning rally soon turned into a squeeze, sending the contract forward
once again to recover ground surrendered earlier in the day.
With Wall Street said to have had no significant impact, December finished
at 2,745, a 22-point improvement on Monday's close, and around 16 points
above its estimated fair value premium to cash of 17.
The premium over fair value remained between 5 and 15 throughout the
session. Turnover at 5,138 lots was again dull, though significantly up from
the previous session.
Traded options were more lively and saw volume of 25,769, up from Monday's
17,563. The FT-SE 100 option traded 7,164 contracts and the Euro FT-SE 2,009
lots.
ASDA, also busy in the equities sector, was once again the liveliest stock
option, having 1,783 lots dealt. The January 50 calls were the most active
series.
