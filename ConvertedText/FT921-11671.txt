FT  30 JAN 92 / Major backs space projects


BRITAIN INTENDS to strengthen its commitment to European satellite and space
efforts when it takes over the presidency of the European Commission in
July, Mr John Major, the prime minister, has told the parliamentary space
committee.
This would underscore the increasing UK involvement in pan-European defence
programmes and lessen its dependence on US technology.
Mr Willem van Eekelen, the secretary-general of the Western European Union,
an international defence co-ordination group, has called on the UK to renew
its support for WEU efforts to create a pan-European satellite surveillance
network.
