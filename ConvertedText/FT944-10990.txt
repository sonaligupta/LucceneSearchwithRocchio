   NEW DELHI


India's biggest private sector company, Reliance Industries, said yesterday
that it intended to merge two of its associates, Reliance Polypropylene and
Reliance Polyethylene, with itself, writes Shiraz Sidhva in New Delhi.
Board members of the three companies are due to meet today to consider the
proposal.
Reliance said the move was intended to protect shareholders of the associate
companies - both single-product manufacturers - from the vagaries of their
specialist markets.
