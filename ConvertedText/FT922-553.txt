FT  26 JUN 92 / UK Company News: BPB halved to Pounds 38m but dividend
lifted on hopes of price rises


   By RICHARD GOURLAY


PLASTERBOARD manufacturers can look forward to a sustained recovery after
three disastrous years in which prices fell by more than 50 per cent in real
terms, BPB Industries, Europe's largest producer said yesterday.
The company was announcing a 51 per cent fall in profits due to the severe
recession in the UK and Canada and low plasterboard prices.
Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 77.8m to Pounds 37.8m on sales down 10 per
cent at Pounds 1.02bn.
Earnings halved to 6p but the company is recommending an increased final
dividend of 7.25p, up from 7p, giving an unchanged total of 11.25p.
Mr John Maxwell, finance director and chief executive designate, said the
growing evidence of price recovery justified the dividend increase.
'Competition has focused on market development, product range, product
quality and customer service instead of even higher discounts to gain
sales,' Mr Maxwell said of the European Gypsum market.
Operating profitability during the year had benefited from cost savings in
the gypsum and the paper divisions.
The savings are likely to improve BPB's competitive position against its
main European rivals, Knauf and Lafarge Coppee.
Plaster and plasterboard sales volumes increased in mainland Europe,
especially in Germany, but the loss of sales in the UK and Canada more than
offset these increases.
Included in the 50 per cent profit fall was a net Pounds 7.6m exceptional
charge relating to Pounds 7.1m of redundancy costs and Pounds 4.1m
additional depreciation provided on surplus plant which was only partly
offset by a Pounds 3.6m profit on the sale of shareholdings.
The previous year, BPB benefited from a Pounds 10.2m net exceptional gain
after receiving insurance proceeds in excess of net book value which offset
redundancy costs of Pounds 12.8m.
