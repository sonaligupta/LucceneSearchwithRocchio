FT  21 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Waterglade plans for reorganisation


After a disappointing year for the property group Waterglade International,
which saw pre-tax losses more than triple to Pounds 18.5m, the new board is
well advanced with reorganisation.
Mr David Cunningham, the new chairman, said the plans were aimed at
maximising revenue and reducing costs and borrowings. Given the substantial
erosion of assets - from Pounds 25m to Pounds 3.35m over the year - the next
stage 'must include some form of capital reorganisation'.
In the year ended March 31 1992 turnover rose from Pounds 9.64m to Pounds
24.6m, reflecting disposals. But there was a trading loss of Pounds 1.51m
(profit Pounds 3.43m) offset by rents received maintained at Pounds 1.7m.
Net interest paid surged to Pounds 5.24m (Pounds 2.98m).
On top of that, exceptional charges totalled Pounds 13.26m (Pounds 8.35m)
including Pounds 12.85m (Pounds 6.66m) provisions against developments to
account for declining market values.
Losses per share in the year were 84.5p (25.8p).
