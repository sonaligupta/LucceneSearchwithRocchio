FT  18 APR 94 / Economic Diary: Other economic news


Monday: UK producer price figures for March are expected to show continued
wide margins, with input prices falling by 3.7 per cent compared with March
last year and output prices rising by 2.8 per cent, substantially down from
August's 4.3 per cent peak. The median forecast for the output price index,
excluding food, drink, tobacco and petrol, points to 'underlying' inflation
of 2.5 per cent at the factory gate.
Tuesday: US merchandise trade figures for March should reveal a deficit of
Dollars 9.3bn against Dollars 9.8bn in February. French visible trade should
show a FFr4.9bn surplus.
Wednesday: Better weather should help US housing starts to rebound in March.
But the expected surge to an annual rate of 1.42m from 1.31m in February may
not last because of rising interest rates.
Thursday: Provisional figures for French consumer prices in March point to a
drop in the year-on-year rate to 1.5 per cent from February's 1.8 per cent.
Friday: UK money supply figures may show a recovery in bank and building
society lending to Pounds 1.5bn in March from Pounds 600m in February.
