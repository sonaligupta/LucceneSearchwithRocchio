FT  07 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Greenwich in the black with Pounds 0.1m


Greenwich Resources, the metals and minerals exploration group, achieved a
turnround from pre-tax losses of Pounds 697,000 to profits of Pounds 106,000
in the year to September 30.
Mr Colin Phipps, chairman, said the result reflected the continuing benefits
from restructuring carried out in 1991-92.
He added that administrative expenses were further reduced during the year
and, of the Pounds 3.7m spent on exploring the mineral properties, the
group's share was largely funded by joint venture partners.
After tax of Pounds 4,000 (Pounds 33,000) earnings per share came through at
0.1p (1p losses).
