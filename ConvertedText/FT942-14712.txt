FT  19 APR 94 / International Company News: DCC plans IPounds 25m flotation


   By TIM COONE


   DUBLIN


DCC, the Dublin-based industrial holding company, is to seek a quotation on
the London and Dublin stock exchanges in May or June through a placing of
new equity.
Mr Jim Flavin, group chief executive said: 'The primary purpose of the
flotation is to get a listing and so we are fairly relaxed over the sum we
are planning to raise, but it will not be over IPounds 25m (Pounds 24.3m).'
Following a 5-for-1 share split last month, there are now 71m shares in
issue, 95 per cent of which are held by institutions.
DCC has gearing of only 6 per cent according to two stockbrokers reports
published yesterday. UBS Global Research also estimates pre-tax profits will
advance by about 40 per cent this year to IPounds 21.3m, giving earnings per
share of 19p on turnover of IPounds 330m.
Bank of Ireland, formerly the biggest shareholder, sold its 20 per cent
stake last December at IPounds 10 per share before the share split.
The flotation price is expected to be between 250p and 300p, for a market
capitalisation of more than IPounds 200m.
Mr Flavin expected the company to be of interest to overseas investors
'wanting to take a view of the Irish market'. About 54 per cent of profits
arise in Ireland with 45 per per cent in the UK.
DCC's operations are concentrated in five divisions: food, energy, print and
publishing, computer products distribution and healthcare. Two thirds of
earnings are derived from the food and energy sectors and a further 19 per
cent from print and publishing.
Mr Flavin plans growth to come 'through organic growth and bolt-on
acquisitions'. Some IPounds 61m has been spent on acquisitions in the past
three years. The issue is to be underwritten by AIB Capital Markets and JO
Hambro Magan. UBS in London and Davy in Dublin have been appointed joint
stockbrokers.
