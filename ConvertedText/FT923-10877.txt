FT  28 JUL 92 / Iraq banks face NY lawsuit over loans


   By ALAN FRIEDMAN


   NEW YORK


THE Bank of New York filed a lawsuit in federal court yesterday charging
that Iraq's state-owned Rafidain Bank and the Central Bank of Iraq had
defaulted on Dollars 1bn (Pounds 523m) of loans.
The lawsuit, in a Manhattan court, seeks to force Rafidain or the Iraqi
central bank, which guaranteed the borrowing, to repay Bank of New York for
its share of the loans.
The New York bank says it is owed more than Dollars 22.6m plus interest on
two loans of Dollars 500m extended to Iraq during the height of the
Iran-Iraq war in the mid-1980s.
Bank of New York put up Dollars 35.2m of the first Dollars 500m loan
extended by 36 banks in 1983, and Dollars 10m toward another loan extended
by 25 banks in 1985. Payments were made on schedule by Iraq until the August
1990 invasion of Kuwait.
Baghdad suspended its debt repayments when the United Nations imposed
economic sanctions.
Iraq has also defaulted on Dollars 2bn of US government loan guarantees,
including more than Dollars 300m related to loans made by the Atlanta,
Georgia, branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL).
Yesterday, in the latest of his disclosures relating to BNL's Iraqi loans,
Mr Henry Gonzalez, chairman of the House banking committee, released
documents showing that weeks before the invasion of Kuwait the Bush
administration allowed the US affiliate of the Iraqi-owned Matrix-Churchill
machine tools company to ship militarily useful technologies to Iraq that
helped President Saddam Hussein's missile projects.
The US export occurred, said Mr Gonzalez, despite US government knowledge
that Matrix-Churchill was part of Iraq's secret procurement network and was
funded by BNL.
