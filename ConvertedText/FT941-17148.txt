FT  06 JAN 94 / Gould attacks Labour policies


Mr Bryan Gould, who mounted an unsuccessful challenge for the Labour
leadership in 1992, is poised to launch a fierce challenge to the party's
economic policies, it was reported today.
Tribune, the left-wing weekly newspaper, said Mr Gould's Full Employment
Forum was about to launch a manifesto accusing Mr John Smith, the party
leader, of paying mere 'lip service' to full employment.
The document calls for a refusal to meet Britain's Maastricht Treaty
commitments, tax increases for the very rich, increased borrowing, an
immediate cut in interest rates to 2 per cent or 3 per cent and effective
devaluation of sterling. It claims these steps would double projected UK
economic growth to 4 per cent.
Mr Alistair Darling, Labour party Treasury spokesman, said: 'The criticism
of John Smith's commitment to full employment is astonishing and completely
unjustified.'
