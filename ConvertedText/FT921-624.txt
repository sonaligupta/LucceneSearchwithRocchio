FT  28 MAR 92 / German armour used against Kurds


GERMANY said yesterday that Turkey had acknowledged using German-supplied
armoured cars in clashes with its minority Kurds, Our Foreign Staff writes.
Mr Dieter Vogel, the government spokesman, told a news conference the
Turkish government had confirmed that vehicles from the former East German
National People's Army had been used in military operations in the Anatolia
region.
'Armoured vehicles supplied by Germany. . . from the former National
People's Army - armoured personnel carriers armed with machine guns - were
deployed for monitoring, surveillance and observation,' he said.
Bonn on Thursday accused Turkey of using German weapons against civilians
and imposed a ban on arms sales to Ankara.
In Lisbon, the Portuguese presidency of the EC said it was seeking further
clarification from the Turkish authorities and EC diplomats in Ankara about
Turkey's attacks on Kurdish villages, before deciding on a common response
by the Twelve.
'There are indications that the situation is much more serious than has been
reported,' the Portuguese Foreign Ministry said yesterday.
The EC diplomats refused to comment on what an EC declaration might contain,
but an EC-wide suspension of military equipment to a Nato member is thought
unlikely.
The presidency said it had raised the issue with its EC partners, even
before the German government on Thursday suspended military supplies to
Turkey and called for EC condemnation of the attacks on the Kurds.
Turkey's Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel sought to defend his security
forces yesterday, arguing that Turkey's tactics against Kurdish rebels were
no different from those Germany had used on its urban guerrillas.
