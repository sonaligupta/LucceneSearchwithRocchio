FT  26 OCT 92 / Italian economy remains fragile


   By ROBERT GRAHAM


   ROME


MR Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, governor of the Bank of Italy, warned over the
weekend that the Italian economy remained exceptionally fragile despite the
decision to lower the discount rate by one percentage point, to 14 per cent,
effective as of today.
Addressing the annual meeting of the Foreign Exchange Association he said
the next six months would be decisive in determining whether the correct
policies could be implemented.
The Forex meeting has traditionally been the occasion for one of the
governor's two set-piece statement's on the economy. Mr Ciampi did not mince
his words and reminded the government, political parties, business and
unions that each had to play their part in holding down inflation, ensuring
the 1993 budget was rigorously observed and advantage was taken of the
lira's devaluation.
He laid special emphasis on the fight against inflation following the lira's
16 per cent devaluation against the D-Mark and its float outside the
Exchange Rate Mechanism.
'If we are not able to take advantage (of the opportunity presented by
devaluation), and the increase in prices is translated into real inflation,
then we will have lost an historic opportunity.'
Inflation in October has continued its downward trend and is hovering near
an annual 5 per cent. However, the effect of devaluation has yet to work
through the economy and already a number of industrialists and food sector
businesses are trying to raise prices.
Mr Ciampi was cautious about a further, quick, reduction in interest rates,
even though real rates remained high. He gave no indication when he thought
the lira might re-enter the ERM.
