FT  19 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Intl Resort Holdings in receivership


International Resort Holdings, the loss-making property and leisure group
which owns Collingtree Golf course, has gone into receivership leaving debts
of Pounds 14m.
Mr Peter Mills of receivers Smith & Williamson said the company was
'significantly insolvent', with liabilities far exceeding assets. At the end
of March 1991, IRH had assets of about Pounds 16m.
Mr Mills said an unofficial valuation earlier this year, commissioned with a
view to a rescue rights issue, had shown that the company's asset value had
fallen too far to allow a cash call. IRH was suspended at 33p last month
following the findings.
Bankers Gamelstaden - which holds a 15 per cent stake in IRH - and Bank of
Scotland called in the receivers on Friday afternoon.
Mr Mills said he was in talks on the sale of Collingtree, in Northampton.
The golf course and property development is valued at Pounds 9m in the
company's books, but Mr Mills said it was now worth 'significantly less than
that'.
