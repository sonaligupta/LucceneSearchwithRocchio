FT  28 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Smaller Companies' rise in asset value


The Smaller Companies Investment Trust reported an increase in both revenue
and net asset value at the half year ended June 30.
Net asset value rose to 89.16p, against 83.13p 12 months earlier, while
income from investments rose from Pounds 320,000 to Pounds 368,000 and net
revenue came out at Pounds 227,000 (Pounds 190,000).
Nonetheless, the company decided not to increase the interim of 1.2p as the
rate of increase in revenue for the whole year is likely to be less than
that of the first half.
