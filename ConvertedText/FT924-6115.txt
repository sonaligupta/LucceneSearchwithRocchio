FT  23 NOV 92 / Survey of World Commercial Vehicles (5): The party appears
to be over - Profile of Man Nutzfahrzeuge


   By KEVIN DONE


AFTER two years of record profits the party appears to be over for MAN
Nutzfahrzeuge, the number two German commercial vehicle maker behind
Mercedes-Benz.
Much more heavily dependent on the home market than its arch domestic rival,
MAN has been buoyed up by the extraordinary surge in truck demand in Germany
in the wake of reunification.
In its last financial year to the end of June it increased its pre-tax
profits by 29.7 per cent, the group's best financial performance.
Its record profits have been in stark contrast to the losses reported
elsewhere in the industry by the likes of DAF and Volvo, but as the wave of
demand in Germany subsides, MAN, too, is having to prepare for tougher times
ahead.
In contrast to the record production and profits achieved in the 1991/92
financial year (to June 30) the value of new orders booked in the year had
already begun to fall sharply, and MAN is now being forced to reduce output
in line with falling sales.
It has cut truck production by around 12 per cent. It has halted output for
one week during November and will also stop production for a week from
January 4. It is cutting overtime, not replacing temporary workers and not
replacing workers lost through natural wastage.
Both profits and turnover are forecast to fall in the current year. MAN has
also warned that further short-time working could be imposed in coming
months, if orders remain at a low level. Turmoil in the currency markets has
greatly increased uncertainty in European markets, it says.
While the outlook for the coming year is deteriorating, MAN at least has the
cushion of a record financial performance in the past two years.
In the 12 months to the end of June the company, a subsidiary of MAN, the
German engineering group, increased its pre-tax profits by 29.7 per cent to
DM506m, while turnover rose by 6.9 per cent to a record DM7.9bn. Sales
outside Germany were unchanged at DM3.2bn, but domestic turnover jumped by
13 per cent to DM4.7bn.
MAN raised its production of trucks and buses by 8.4 per cent to a record
41,590 with the company's plants in Germany and in Austria working at full
capacity. In contrast to the wholesale job losses elsewhere in the industry
it increased its workforce by more than 1,000 to 28,900 at the end of June.
MAN truck and bus sales worldwide rose by 7 per cent to 40,815 in 1991/92
from 38,146, helped by strong demand in Germany and in Austria. The increase
was achieved in spite of a fall in the total western European market for
trucks (from 6 tonnes gross vehicle weight) to 277,000 in the calendar year
1991 from 287,000 a year earlier.
The group's strong presence in the German market, where it accounts for more
than a fifth of all truck sales (over 3.5 tonnes gross vehicle weight), has
allowed it to achieve a record share of the total western European market
where Germany is the dominant force.
According to DRI, the UK-based automotive analysts, MAN has moved from last
place among the seven leading European heavy truck makers in 1990 to third
place last year behind only Mercedes-Benz and Iveco. Its share of the
western European heavy truck market (over 15 tonnes) has surged from 8.8 per
cent in 1990 to 12.8 per cent in 1991. DRI forecasts that MAN's share will
have risen to a peak of 13.4 per cent this year before weakening in 1993, as
the German market contracts.
MAN has been able to boost production to cope with the surge in demand in
Germany thanks to its 1990 acquisition of the Steyr truck operations in
Austria. MAN has moved the assembly of its M90 medium-weight truck range to
Steyr, which produced nearly 4,800 MAN trucks in the 1991/92 financial year.
Steyr also holds a market share of around 23 per cent in its domestic market
in Austria.
The German group is investing DM320m in the Steyr operations, of which
around DM89m was spent last year in part for the building of a new truck
assembly line.
MAN Nutzfahrzeuge group capital expenditure has risen rapidly in the past
five years from DM170m in 1987/88 to DM395m in 1991/92, with the focus on
creating a flexible production network between the five German and two
Austrian plants.
After its record performance of the past two years declining new orders in
recent months indicate that the coming two years will be much more difficult
for MAN. The high level of orders it is still taking for buses, is
insufficient to compensate for the rapid drop in new truck business.
Falling new orders from the domestic German market combined with stagnant or
declining demand from export markets has led to a 20.3 per cent fall in the
value of new orders booked by MAN in the 12 months to the end of June to
DM7.2bn. The value of new domestic orders fell by 28.1 per cent to DM4.1bn,
while foreign orders declined by 6.5 per cent to DM3.1bn.
The value of the order book had fallen by 22.7 per cent to DM3.49bn at the
end of June from DM4.5bn a year earlier. In the first quarter of the 1992/93
financial year (July to September) the value of new orders had fallen again
by 27.8 per cent to DM1.3bn from DM1.8bn in the same period a year ago.
The group claims it has been unable to move as quickly as it had hoped to
build up a dealer and service network in eastern Germany, often because of
problems in establishing land ownership and gaining the necessary approvals.
It now has four wholly-owned service centres in principal cities.
In Hungary, MAN has recently signed a letter of intent with Raba, the
Hungarian engineering company, and Mogurt, the trading company, to
co-operate in assembling trucks. The aim of the deal is for MAN to deliver
diesel engines and truck cabs to Raba, chiefly for all-wheel drive vehicles
exclusively for the Hungarian market.
MAN is also expanding control of its importer/distributor organisation in
western Europe and earlier this year it took over the UK MAN truck importing
business for Pounds 20m from Lonrho, the London-based international trading
group.
The German truck maker accounted for 4.9 per cent of the UK truck market
(above 3.5 tonnes) last year, where it is relatively weak compared with its
presence elsewhere in Europe. It was only in eighth place in the UK, where
it is still overshadowed by groups such as DAF, Iveco and Mercedes-Benz.
