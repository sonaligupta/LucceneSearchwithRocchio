FT  20 JUL 94 / International Company News: Australian theme park plans
unveiled


   By AGENCIES


Plans for two separate theme park ventures in Australia were announced
yesterday, agencies report.
Nine Network, the Australian television company controlled by Mr Kerry
Packer, and Village Roadshow, the leisure industries concern, have formed a
ADollars 100m (USDollars 73.5m) joint venture to develop 'out-of-home'
entertainment concepts in Australia, Asia and the Pacific Rim.
The companies said the venture, to be called Village Nine Leisure, would
create a series of theme parks, entertainment centres and adventure
playgrounds.
Nine Network and Village Roadshow said there were plans to open as many as
20 suburban 'indoor theme parks' in Australian regional centres, in
conjunction with the Westfield group. The parks will include indoor
adaptations of most sports.
The first of the parks, called 'Intencity,' will open in Hurstville in
Sydney in December.
Meanwhile, Sega Enterprises, the Japanese manufacturer of electronic games,
plans to build six space-age indoor theme parks and 20 large-scale arcades
around Australia, at a cost of about ADollars 250m.
Each park is expected to cost up to ADollars 50m to build and equip, while
the arcades are expected to cost between ADollars 2m and ADollars 5m. Sega
expects the first to open early next year.
