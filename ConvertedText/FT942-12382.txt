FT  29 APR 94 / International Company News: Earnings at Placer Dome more
than trebled

A stronger gold price and higher investment income helped Placer Dome, the
Vancouver-based gold producer, more than treble first-quarter earnings.
Net earnings were USDollars 37m, or 16 cents a share, up from Dollars 11m,
or 5 cents a share, a year earlier. The latest figures include a Dollars 6m
after-tax gain from the sale of investments in other mining companies.
Revenues edged up to Dollars 216m from Dollars 213m.
Cash production costs rose to Dollars 198 from Dollars 192 per ounce, but
this was more than offset by an increase in the average gold price received
to Dollars 385 per ounce from Dollars 352.
Placer's share of gold output from its 13 mines dipped to 442,000 ounces
from 450,000 ounces.
Production increases at eight mines were offset by lower output at the
Kidston mine in Australia, Detour Lake in Ontario and Misima in Papua New
Guinea. Placer's share was also affected by its lower interest, currently 25
per cent, in the Porgera mine in Papua New Guinea.
Production for 1994 as a whole is forecast at 2.1m ounces, up from 1.8m
ounces in 1993.
Placer said construction of the 50 per cent-owned Zaldivar copper mine in
Chile is on schedule and on budget. The mine, with an annual capacity of
125,000 tonnes, is due to start production in the second half of 1995.
