VOLVO, the Swedish motor vehicle group, announced a SKr4.75bn (Pounds 430m)
deficit after financial items in 1992, the worst result in its history. The
loss followed difficult market conditions, heavy restructuring costs and
huge foreign exchange losses.
The performance, which compares with a SKr1.5bn profit in 1991, led the
group to halve its dividend to SKr7.75 per share, the first time it has ever
reduced its pay-out. The group's B shares fell SKr6 to end at SKr394.
The group said the result would have no impact on continuing discussions
over deeper collaboration with the French carmaker Renault.
Volvo suffered a SKr4bn loss after financial items in the fourth quarter of
1992, after taking one-off charges amounting to nearly SKr3.8bn.
Restructuring costs, mainly related to the group's planned closure of its
Kalmar and Uddevalla plants, amounted to SKr1.45bn. It suffered a further
SKr650m in foreign exchange losses and SKr1.14bn in losses related to
associate companies.
Underlying industry conditions for both cars and trucks were bleak, the
group stated.
'Demand for heavy trucks in Europe declined sharply during the last three
months of 1992,' it added.
Sales rose to SKr83.0bn from SKr77.2bn, although adjusted for disposals and
acquisitions, they were unchanged. Sales of the group's car operations rose
to SKr44.6bn from SKr37.0bn, but the group's truck unit saw a 5 per cent
drop in sales to SKr30.4bn. The group's operating loss deepened to SKr2.25bn
from SKr1.17bn.
Operating losses within Volvo Car Group rose to SKr1.83bn from SKr1.77bn,
although excluding the currency impact, they improved to a SKr1.17bn
deficit. The group noted that in the fourth quarter its car division posted
an operating loss of just SKr81m, excluding currency factors, which was
substantially better than in preceding quarters.
However, Volvo Truck Group saw a sharp turnaround, slumping to a SKr641m
operating loss from a SKr664m profit in 1991.
The group did not make a forecast for 1993, but its result is expected to
rebound, due to the absence of one-off items and the weakening of the
Swedish krona.
