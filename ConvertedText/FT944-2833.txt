FT  15 DEC 94 / Concern at bank bills for business


High street banks may have overcharged as many as 10 per cent of small and
medium-sized businesses by up to a total of Pounds 1.75bn, the Banking
Liaison Group says.
The group of former bankers, which advises businesses on relationships with
banks, wants each bank to appoint a senior executive to work with the group
and similar organisations to resolve complaints.
Mr John Sillett, group chief executive, said banks often admitted their
errors but were more unwilling to accept responsibility for consequential
losses or damage to a company's reputation.
