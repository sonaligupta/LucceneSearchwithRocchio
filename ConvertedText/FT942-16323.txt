FT  11 APR 94 / UK Company News: Queue forms to bid for Chunnel rail link


   By ANDREW JACK


The government is aware of about six consortia planning to bid for the
Channel Tunnel rail link, officials said yesterday.
Bovis, the construction subsidiary of P&O, Ove Arup, the consulting
engineer, and Eurorail, which includes Trafalgar House and BICC, are all
among those groups expected to submit tenders.
The Department of Transport would not comment on names, but said yesterday
that it had received initial expressions of interest from about 30 groups,
of which half a dozen were expected to submit plans.
Pre-qualification proposals must be submitted by April 25, and a decision on
the groups which will be allowed to submit full tenders will be made in
June. These must be completed by the end of the year.
The Pounds 2.7bn 68-mile link between London's St Pancras station and the
Channel Tunnel is expected to be the largest joint public-private sector
construction project this decade.
