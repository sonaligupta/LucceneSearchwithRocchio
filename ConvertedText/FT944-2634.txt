FT  16 DEC 94 / 17 firms named to handle power sale


   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor


Seventeen investment firms were named yesterday by the government to handle
the sale of its remaining 40 per cent stake in the power generators National
Power and PowerGen.
Although the 17 have been divided into geographical areas, they will all
have equal status as distributors.
The joint co-ordinators are Barclays de Zoete Wedd and Kleinwort Benson
Securities. Other international managers are Cazenove, Paribas, UBS and SG
Warburg.
North American managers are Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, JP Morgan, NatWest
Markets and RBC Dominion. Managers for the rest of the world are Argentaria,
Flemings, Lehman Brothers, Mediobanca, Nikko Securities and WestLB.
Pre-selling of the shares will begin next month, with the sale itself in
February. The value of the shares is about Pounds 4bn, although this will be
reduced after National Power concludes its recent deal to buy back 10 per
cent of its own shares directly from the government.
The government yesterday appointed Morgan Stanley to advise it on the Pounds
4bn flotation of the National Grid Company. Although the company is owned by
regional electricity companies, the government holds a golden share.
