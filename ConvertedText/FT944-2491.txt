FT  16 DEC 94 / Kenyan action on bank theft


   By LESLIE CRAWFORD


   NAIROBI


A former senior civil servant in Kenya has been charged with conspiring to
steal Ks5.76bn (Pounds 82m) from the central bank in a move timed to
reassure a donors' meeting in Paris of the government's commitment to stamp
out corruption. Mr Wilfred Koinange, the powerful permanent secretary at the
treasury until his retirement in May, is the most senior government official
to be charged in connection with a series of financial scandals which robbed
the Exchequer of over Ks30bn last year - the biggest embezzlement of public
funds in Kenya's history. Mr Koinange denied the prosecution charges and has
been remanded in custody until his bail application is heard next week.
The International Monetary Fund is understood to have warned President
Daniel arap Moi that it would not sign a new loan agreement unless his
government took firm steps to bring wrongdoers to justice. Without the IMF's
seal of approval, neither the World Bank nor bilateral donors would be
likely to pledge more aid at the Consultative Group meeting in Paris today.
Kenya is seeking up to Dollars 800m (Pounds 512m) in aid for 1995.
