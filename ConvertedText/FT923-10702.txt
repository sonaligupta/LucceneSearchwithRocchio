FT  29 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Allianz and Daimler drag
Frankfurt lower


   By Our Markets Staff


BAD news from the corporate sector dealt a blow to Frankfurt's recovery
hopes, writes our markets staff.
FRANKFURT weakened after the insurer Allianz reported disappointing 1991
earnings, due to its first ever underwriting losses, mainly at its US
subsidiary.
Shares in Allianz lost more than DM50 in the pre-bourse, fell steadily
during the session and closed down DM62, or 3 per cent, at DM1,955, just off
an intraday year's low of DM1,951.
The news depressed sentiment, with the FAZ index 2.6 lower at 640.96 by
midsession and the DAX index losing 7.45 to 1,610.64. Turnover rose to
DM4.5bn from DM4.2bn.
The market sank further into gloom following the publication of June German
new car sales. Lower sales of Mercedes cars pulled Daimler down by DM11.50
to DM689.50.
The data reaffirmed Volkswagen's grip on the domestic car market although
its shares followed the day's downward trend, shedding DM2.20 to 352.30.
Porsche lost DM12 to DM500.
The banking sector was helped by some good first half figures from
Bayerische Hypobank, up DM3 to DM373, as the market awaited today's results
from Commerzbank, which was DM2.20 stronger at DM239.20.
AMSTERDAM rose as the chemical sector climbed in technical trading ahead of
tomorrow's half-year results from DSM. The CBS Tendency index put on 0.5 to
115.1.
DSM advanced Fl 1.70 to Fl 99.40 while Akzo performed even better, rising Fl
4.60 to Fl 138 but in low volume.
Fokker sank further, losing Fl 1.60 to Fl 25.90 as minority shareholders
continued to sell the stock following Dasa's takeover of the aircraft
manufacturer. There were reports that Dasa would offer the Dutch government
up to Fl 40 per share for its 32 per cent stake.
A report that Elsevier's newspaper publishing division was failing to meet
profit targets took its shares to a year's low, down Fl 2.20 or 2 per cent
to Fl 103.50.
PARIS rose for a second day but trading remained thin and there was little
corporate news for the market to chew on. The CAC-40 index finished 13.65
higher at 1,769.00 in turnover of just FFr1.6bn.
Among the most active stocks, Alcatel Alsthom jumped FFr11 to FFr620 while
BSN continued to fall, losing FFr14 to FFr1,019. Euro Disney fell a further
FFr1.55 to FFr93.20.
Remy Cointreau, the drinks company, jumped FFr10 or 6.3 per cent to FFr168
but the rise came in low volume of 11,750 shares.
MILAN underwent a technical rebound as dealers covered their short positions
but dealers said that the market remained on a downward path. The Comit
index rose 1.63 to 400.01 in turnover estimated at L80bn after L77bn.
Fiat was fixed just L1 lower at L4,408 but rose to L4,460 on short-covering
after hours.
STOCKHOLM continued to recover but turnover remained thin at SKr161m after
SKr159m as the summer holiday season progressed. The Affarsvarlden General
index rose 12.9 to 854.7. Skandia rose SKr2 to SKr93.5 on hopes that a
solution was in sight to the battle between Skandia and UNI Storebrand of
Norway for control of the Swedish group.
ZURICH rose in quiet trading. The SMI index improved 15.5 to 1,777.4. Banks
and insurers were again the day's most active issues with UBS bearers up
SFr11 at SFr698 and Winterthur bearers and registered shares adding SFr80
and SFr60 respectively to SFr2,960 and SFr2,760.
OSLO was lifted by a recovery in Norsk Hydro, up NKr2.5 to NKr149, as the
all-share index rose 6.22 to 386.52 in turnover worth NKr190.3m. Hafslund,
due to report first half figures today, saw its A shares close NKr2 higher
at NKr156.
VIENNA recovered slightly as the ATX index gained 7.75 or 1 per cent to
773.52 in low volume. Austrian Airlines went against the trend, losing Sch70
to Sch1,730.
ISTANBUL took profits as banks announced lower deposit rates. The 75-share
index closed down 44.05 at 4,166.00.
