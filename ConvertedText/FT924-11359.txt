FT  27 OCT 92 / International Company News: Amexco hands its card back to
Ogilvy


   By ALAN FRIEDMAN


   NEW YORK


AMERICAN Express, buffeted by image problems and by losses at its credit
card division, has sacked Chiat/Day/Mojo, the advertising agency it chose
less than a year ago to handle its Dollars 60m of card promotion.
The US advertising world was taken by surprise a year ago when American
Express withdrew the bulk of its card business from Ogilvy & Mather, a
subsidiary of the WPP Group, and switched it to Chiat.
That decision affected a 29-year relationship with Ogilvy which created the
'Membership has its privileges' and the 'Do you know me?' card and
travellers cheque campaigns.
Now, in a complete reversal, American Express has decided to return to
Ogilvy.
The change in ad agencies comes at a time when American Express is feeling
more competitive pressure from low-fee bank cards and non-bank cards such as
those launched recently by General Motors and General Electric. The GM card
has chalked up nearly a million new holders in only a few weeks.
The big losers are the advertising staff of Chiat/Day/Mojo, the New York
agency brought in to replace Ogilvy. Chiat's strategy involved ads that
featured giant American Express cards in golf courses and restaurants. But
the company's share of cards issued actually fell during the first half of
1992.
Ogilvy, meanwhile, has a new 'merchant testi-monial' campaign that features
Arrigo Cipriani of Harry's Bar and other American Express merchants who
speak well of the famous green card.
Chiat is still left with the account for American Express gold card in
Britain. The reason, according to American Express, is that the switch back
to Ogilvy concerned US rather than international advertising.
