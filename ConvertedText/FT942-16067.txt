profits increase to R441m

Gold Fields of South Africa yesterday reported an increase in after-tax
profit to R441.1m (Dollars 89.1m) in the third quarter to March, on the back
of a higher gold price received, well up on the same quarter last year when
profits were R267.4m.
The figure compares with the R387.7m recorded in the December quarter.
Pre-tax figures were even stronger at R626.4m, compared with R530.2m in the
previous quarter, reflecting a solid operating performance from the four
mining companies.
The quantity of gold produced was almost unchanged at 30,982kg, against
30,713kg the previous quarter, but sales revenue advanced to R1.31bn from
R1.22bn, boosted by an increase in the average gold price to R42,156 per kg,
up from R39,758, on continued weakening of the rand.
Mr Alan Munro, executive director, pronounced the results 'a fine
achievement in a difficult quarter,' noting that the overwhelming bulk of
this tax was on the group's star performer, Driefontein.
The mine, the country's most profitable, had another exceptionally strong
quarter with its east division increasing an already high yield to 11.6
grammes a tonne.
Pre-tax profits rose to R405.8m from R329.7m the previous quarter. However
Mr Munro warned that such an exceptionally high grade could not be expected
to continue for much longer.
Kloof, the other large producer in the group, lifted after-tax profit to
R192.3m from R174.1m.
This improvement came despite the continued loss of production after an
accident in one of its shafts and a disappointing quarter from its Libanon
division, which posted a loss of R1.1m after last quarter's R3.7m profit.
Troubled Doornfontein maintained after-tax profit at R4.27m compared with
R4.33m, but the figures did not include a R6m award for unfair dismissals
which will be paid in the current quarter.
The group's other producer, Deelkraal, also improved to R15.7m from R14.9m.
