FT  06 JAN 94 / Buyers may leave Glaxo drug


   By DANIEL GREEN


Glaxo could suffer a sharp slowdown in sales of its biggest-selling product,
the ulcer treatment Zantac, later this year, according to a survey published
yesterday by Goldman Sachs, the US stock broker.
The survey found that a large majority of healthcare buyers in the US will
'allow or encourage less use of Zantac' after May. The US accounts for half
of Zantac's Pounds 2.2bn a year sales. May sees the expiry of US patents on
one of the drug's main competitors, Tagamet, made by the Anglo-US company
SmithKline Beecham.
After that date the active ingredient of Tagamet can be made by
manufacturers of unbranded generic drugs. Previous examples of drugs leaving
patent protection indicate that prices can fall by up to 90 per cent.
Zantac and Tagamet work on a similar principle, which helps explain why
healthcare buyers would consider a change to save money, even though Zantac
outsells Tagamet by three to one.
Glaxo responded to the survey by saying that sales would not be affected by
'making a cheaper rival cheaper'. But the prospect of healthcare buyers
actively switching to generic Tagamet hurt Glaxo shares, which fell 23p to
693p yesterday.
Goldman Sachs also asked healthcare buyers whether they would allow or
encourage a switch from Zantac's biggest competitor, the much newer Losec,
made by Swedish company Astra. Losec is in a different class of drugs and
less than half of those who responded to the poll thought that Losec sales
would suffer when Tagamet's US patents expired.
Goldman Sachs approached 228 of the biggest healthcare buyers in the US for
its survey - 28 per cent responded.
The broker said that any fall in Zantac sales would not take place 'very
quickly'. Glaxo became the world's second biggest drugs company during the
1980s thanks to Zantac.
