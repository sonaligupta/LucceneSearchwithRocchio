FT  29 JAN 92 / Posters promote themselves


TWO of the UK's largest outdoor poster groups yesterday launched a joint
national campaign to boost posters' 4 per cent share of the advertising
market.
With a series of posters, Mills and Allen, part of Avenir Havas Media (AHM),
Europe's leading poster site contractor, and Maiden Outdoor will promote
posters as a useful, overlooked and cost-efficient method of advertising.
Their posters show slogans in large type emphasising the size of the
hoardings. They include 'Give me a big idea,' 'Make the logo bigger' and 'I
want to see more of my product.'
