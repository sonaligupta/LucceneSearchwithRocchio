FT  12 MAR 93 / Steel closure postponed


   By QUENTIN PEEL


The supervisory board of Krupp-Hoesch, the newly-merged steel group,
yesterday postponed a decision to close its integrated steel plant at
Duisburg-Rheinhausen, after mass protests by the workforce, writes Quentin
Peel.
Demonstrators threw eggs and insults at Mr Gerhard Cromme, the chief
executive, whose management team had recommended the closure. A final
decision will now be taken on April 29, a spokesman said.
