FT  16 MAR 94 / Observer: Reptile house


Who says that members of the European parliament don't have a sense of
humour?
Take Johanna-Christina Grund, a German Euro-MP. She has floated the notion
that, given the high annual rent for the new parliamentary debating chamber
 -Ecu100m annually for 27 years - visitors should be charged an entry fee.
She says it should 'be at a similar level for national museums, zoos, etc in
Belgium'. MEPs might occasionally be mistaken for stuffed exhibits and
sometimes behave like animals; but really, let's have a pan-European
aggregate rate, please.
