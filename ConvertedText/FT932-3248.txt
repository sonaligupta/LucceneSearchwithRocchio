FT  15 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Chillington improves to Pounds 955,000


Reduced losses in manufacturing and increased profits in tools and trading
enabled Chillington Corporation to report pre-tax profits of Pounds 955,000
for 1992, against Pounds 646.000.
The company has returned to the dividend list with a proposed final of
0.25p. Last year only the interim of 0.5p was paid.
However a provision of Pounds 1.27m against possible losses from the closure
of the property and investment division left retained losses of Pounds 1.28m
(Pounds 777,000).
Turnover for the company, which also has interests in plantations, was
Pounds 44.4m (Pounds 48.6m). Losses per share came out at 0.2p, compared
with 2.4p.
