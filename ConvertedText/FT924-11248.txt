FT  27 OCT 92 / Fire cuts oil production at Sullom Voe terminal


   By NEIL BUCKLEY


A FIRE at Europe's largest oil terminal, Sullom Voe in Shetland, yesterday
halved oil production and resulted in the suspension of gas processing.
No one was injured in the blaze.
The Pounds 400m terminal handles nearly half the UK's North Sea oil
production. British Petroleum, which owns the terminal, said the fire
merited a Stage Two response - requiring help to be brought in from outside
 -which categorises it as a serious incident. Stage Three response incidents
are the most serious.
The fire was discovered at about 12.20am in a drying unit in the gas
processing area but was brought under control before 1am by the terminal's
fire service, assisted by brigades from Brae and Lerwick. Firefighters then
controlled the fire and allowed it to continue burning until 8am to consume
excess gas.
BP launched an immediate investigation into the cause of the fire, but said
it was too early to reach any conclusions. The company said it was also too
early to assess the extent or likely cost of the damage, although some
buildings had been damaged.
Neither of the two oil pipelines into the terminal was damaged, but normal
oil production of almost 900,000 barrels a day was halved as a precaution.
BP said it expected production to return to normal by the end of yesterday.
The terminal is likely to have suffered a loss of production of about
250,000 barrels, with a market value of about Dollars 5m.
Gas production will be suspended until damaged equipment is repaired. BP
said most gas from the East Shetlands Basin goes to the St Fergus terminal
north of Aberdeen rather than to Sullom Voe.
Gas processed at Sullom Voe does not go into the national grid but is
compressed into liquefied petroleum gas. The terminal typically produces
about 1,000 tonnes of butane and 1,000 tonnes of propane a week.
