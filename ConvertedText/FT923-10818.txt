FT  28 JUL 92 / International Company News: Weak metal prices push Inco into
red at halftime


   By ROBERT GIBBENS

WEAK prices for nickel and precious metals and lower deliveries depressed
Inco's results for the second quarter and first half of 1992.
These two factors outweighed higher prices realised for cobalt and Inco's
continuing cost reduction programme.
The second quarter showed a loss, after preferred dividends of USDollars
2.7m, or 3 cents a share, against a profit of Dollars 29m, or 28 cents, a
year earlier.
Net metal sales were Dollars 666m against Dollars 803m. These included
primary metal sales of Dollars 510m against Dollars 617m. Total revenues
were Dollars 681m against Dollars 820m.
Operating earnings before taxes, interest, corporate expense and exchange
adjustments were Dollars 47m against Dollars 104m.
For the first half, there was a loss of Dollars 1.7m, or 2 cents a share,
against a profit of Dollars 81.3m, or 78 cents, a year earlier. Net metal
sales were Dollars 1.34bn against Dollars 1.64bn, and total revenues Dollars
1.38bn against Dollars 1.67bn. Operating earnings were Dollars 88m against
Dollars 249m.
Inco said its average realised nickel price in the second quarter was
Dollars 3.48 a pound and in the first half Dollars 3.53 a pound, down from
Dollars 3.97 and Dollars 3.96, respectively, a year earlier.
The copper price received averaged little more than Dollars 1 a pound in the
first half.
Second-quarter nickel deliveries were 118m lb, against 133m lb, and in the
first half 239m lb, against 269m lb. Copper deliveries were slightly higher
in the second quarter, but in the first half were down to 130m lb from 144m
lb.
First-half deliveries of platinum, gold, and silver fell but cobalt gained
slightly.
