FT  29 APR 94 / UK Company News: Toye cuts deficit to Pounds 511,000


Over 1993 - 'a year of transition' according to directors - Toye & Company,
the civil and military regalia manufacturer, reduced pre-tax losses from
Pounds 1.46m to Pounds 511,000.
The outcome, achieved on turnover of Pounds 10.9m (Pounds 10.5m), including
Pounds 9.44m (Pounds 8.98m) from continuing operations, was after a
provision of Pounds 105,000 against the discontinued corporate clothing
offshoot.
The integration of the Cornelia James Neckwear business, acquired last July,
was completed by the year-end and should contribute to profits in the
future.
Losses per share narrowed to 21.41p (51.56p).
