increased loss for the first half, sees further losses in the second, and is
making management changes.
On the news on Friday the share price fell 6p to 32p.
Mr Barry Spencer, who joined the board in September, is to become chairman

non-executive director, and Mr Peter Giles has become a director and chief
executive.
Mr Spencer was formerly chairman at Parkland Textile and Mr Giles has
considerable experience in turn-around situations. They will undertake a
