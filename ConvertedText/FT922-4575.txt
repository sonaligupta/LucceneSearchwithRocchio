FT  04 JUN 92 / International Company News: Target markets set by Zurich
Insurance


   By IAN RODGER


   ZURICH


ZURICH Insurance, which has expanded rapidly in the US in recent years, is
focusing plans for expansion on the UK and Germany. 'The two markets where
we believe we are not represented as well as we would like are Germany and
the UK,' Mr Rolf Huppi, chief executive, said yesterday.
Mr Huppi said that the group was 'obviously' looking for acquisitions.'
Zurich earlier this year acquired the Australian interests of the UK
composite insurer, Guardian Royal Exchange, but Zurich officials did not
encourage speculation that this deal might lead to something bigger.
Another Zurich official indicated that the group had no interest in
Municipal Mutual, a UK company in difficulty.
Mr Rolf Hanggi, deputy chief executive, said Zurich expected 'a good overall
financial result' this year.
