FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Dobson Park raises Pounds 18m and buys rest
of Longwall


   By PETER PEARSE


Dobson Park Industries is making a recommended offer for the outstanding
41.1 per cent holding in Longwall International, it mining equipment
associate. It proposes to part fund the deal with a 1-for-4 rights issue at
62p to raise Pounds 17.7m net.
The shares eased 3p to 75p.
At the same time, the mining equipment, industrial electronics and toys
group revealed pre-tax profits more than doubled for the year to October 1.
Profits leapt to Pounds 10.5m pre-tax, at the top end of expectations. The
comparable Pounds 4.16m was struck after a Pounds 4.59m loss from the
disposal of the Power Tools and Revere Aerospace. Adjusted for the effect of
the disposals profits rose 20 per cent.
Turnover fell to Pounds 100m, including Pounds 4.47m from acquisitions,
against Pounds 123.4m, including Pounds 28.9m from discontinued activities.
Underlying turnover showed an increase of 6 per cent.
Earnings rose from 1.42p, or 4.65p adjusted, to 5.45p and the final dividend
is held at 2.55p for an unchanged total 3.75p.
Mr Alan Kaye, chairman, said the dividend could not be raised because of
bank covenants connected with the Longwall joint venture.
In January 1993 Dobson merged its mining equipment interests with Meco
International, a 1989 buy-out from Dowty, into Longwall. Dobson held 50 per
cent of the shares and 35 per cent of the votes. In September 1993, it
bought Westpac's 8.9 per cent stake for Pounds 2m, though the 12 per cent of
the votes could not be utilised until either Dobson made a general offer or
Longwall was floated.
Dobson reduced its dividend payments when Longwall was set up as the joint
venture had no cash flow, being laden with borrowings dating from the mbo.
Dobson is assuming the borrowings, which, at November 18, stood at Pounds
23.5m. Indeed Mr Kaye said Dobson wanted Longwall 'to score' by refinancing
it 'in a plc-type way'.
Dobson is offering Pounds 18.4m in cash with an alternative comprising an
initial cash payment of Pounds 16.4m and a performance-related payment of up
to Pounds 11.6m, linked to profit and cash generated over three years.
Mr Kaye said that Longwall's management, holding 25.8 per cent of the shares
and 41.6 per cent of the voting rights had accepted and opted for the
performance related alternative. That enables Dobson to speak for 84.7 per
cent of the shares and 88.5 per cent of the voting rights.
Group operating profits fell to Pounds 5.78m (Pounds 6.58m), though the
associates - Longwall and Instem - contributed a further Pounds 4.79m
(Pounds 2.95m).
The industrial electronics side lifted pre-interest profits to Pounds 4.72m
(Pounds 3.95m); mining equipment rose to Pounds 5.01m (Pounds 4.48m); toys
and plastics advanced to Pounds 1.63m (Pounds 1.38m); and a property sale
brought in Pounds 448,000 (Pounds 39,000).
