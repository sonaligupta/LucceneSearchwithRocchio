FT  27 JUL 92 / Romanian economy in decline


   By VIRGINIA MARSH

ROMANIA'S already weak economy declined further in the first half of 1992,
figures published by the country's statistics commission indicate, writes
Virginia Marsh in Bucharest.
Mr George Danielescu, minister of finance, described the country's half-year
economic indicators as grim. He singled out the continuing drop in
industrial production and high inflation as particularly negative signs.
Industrial production fell by 19.5 per cent in the first half, contributing
to an overall decline of 47 per cent since 1989 when the Ceausescu regime
was overthrown, while consumer price inflation has this year averaged 10.4
per cent a month.
Inflationary pressures will remain high in coming months due to the near 100
per cent devaluation of the leu in the past three months and to a further 25
per cent reduction in subsidies on many basic foods due on September 1.
On a more positive note, Mr Danielescu stressed Romania's foreign debt -
Dollars 3.24bn or Dollars 141 per capita - remained low and compared
favourably with Bulgaria, Poland and Hungary, where per capita debt exceeded
Dollars 1,200.
He was also encouraged by growth in exports, up 21 per cent against last
year's period.
