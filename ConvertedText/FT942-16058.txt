Motorola, the US electronics and semiconductor group, yesterday reported a
surge in first quarter net income to Dollars 298m from Dollars 204m, as
sales in the period rose from Dollars 3.63bn to Dollars 4.69bn.
The pace of growth in net income represented a slowdown from last year's
profit increase of more than 100 per cent, and disappointed analysts.

plunged to Dollars 99 1/4 in after-hours trading.
The company said its net margin on sales was 6.4 per cent in this year's
first quarter compared with 5.6 per cent in the same period last time.
In the general systems sector, it said orders rose 62 per cent in the first
quarter. Among semiconductor products, orders increased in all markets, led
by the Americas and Japan.
Orders were strongest for communications devices, Mos digital-analog,
advanced micro-controllers, fast static and dynamic Rams, and Risc
microprocessors.
Sales in the automotive, energy and controls group rose 58 per cent, while
orders rose by 60 per cent.
But sales in the information systems group fell by 7 per cent, and orders in
the sector by 11 per cent.
Earnings per share rose from 72 cents to Dollars 1.03.
Motorola said that a 2-for-1 stock split would take place on April 18.
