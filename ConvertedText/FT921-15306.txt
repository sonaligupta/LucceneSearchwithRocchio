CANADIAN Pacific Forest Products, one of Canada's largest pulp and paper
groups which is 80 per cent owned by Canadian Pacific Ltd, , is to close
down several older paper machines and axe nearly 2,000 jobs, writes Robert
Gibbens in Montreal.
Together with other restructuring moves, CPFP will take a special CDollars
375m (USDollars 328.9m) after-tax charge in its 1991 accounts. In the first
nine months, it posted a loss of CDollars 107m or C2.44 a share on sales of
CDollars 1.5bn.
