FT  02 NOV 93 / International Company News: Foster's sells meat interest to
US group

THE STREAM of non-core asset disposals by Foster's Brewing Group, the
Australian brewing company which owns Courage in the UK, continued yesterday
when the company announced the sale of a 45 per cent interest in Australia
Meat Holdings, a meat processing business, for about ADollars 100m
(USDollars 66.6m).
The stake is being bought by ConAgra, the large US food group, and
Australian interests associated with the D. R. Johnson group.
ConAgra already owns a 50 per cent stake in Australia Meat Holdings, which
it acquired when Foster's sold a package of agri-business assets - also
including brewing materials and wool - for around ADollars 300m.
That sale, two years ago, left Fosters with a 45 per cent interest in
Australia Meat, and D. R. Johnson, a New South Wales abattoir company,
holding the remaining 5 per cent.
Foster's, which now has a stated policy of concentrating on its main brewing
business, said it expected to book a profit of around ADollars 47m on the
sale of the remaining stake in AMH.
The brewing company also said yesterday AMH had bought the group's Portland
abattoir, which AMH had been operating since 1989 and leasing since 1991, in
a separate deal.
The latest deal, which is subject to various regulatory procedures including
a green light from the Foreign Investment Review Board, means Foster's has
now garnered about ADollars 536m from non-core asset disposals since its
June year-end.
This follows asset sales of around ADollars 650m in the previous financial
year.
Funds raised from this process are being used to pay down group debt.
