FT  22 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Lucas pips Valeo to US components company


   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent


Lucas Industries, the automotive and aerospace component manufacturer, has
moved to strengthen its US business by agreeing to buy for Dollars 87m
(Pounds 54m) cash Lake Center Industries from Guy F Atkinson of San Bruno,
California.
This is Dollars 7m more than the sum which Valeo, the French components
manufacturer, said it would pay for the company. Valeo announced last Monday
that it had reached agreement to buy LCI.
Atkinson and Lucas had been 'talking over the last few weeks', Lucas said.
The discussions continued despite the Valeo announcement, indicating that
Atkinson had been playing one potential buyer off against the other.
Valeo said that it 'had not accepted a new request on the part of Atkinson
to increase the acquisition price and to modify certain essential conditions
initially agreed.' It would not therefore go ahead with the purchase.
Both Valeo and Lucas have been anxious to build up their presence in the US.
Lucas, seeking to strengthen its core automotive and aerospace activities,
will fit LCI into its automotive Body Systems business, which specialises in
electronic systems used inside vehicles. Body Systems is one of the nine
business areas Lucas has designated as central to its future.
LCI's speciality is the manufacture of control systems for heating and
ventilation of vehicles, products which Lucas has not made.
The purchase will enhance its ability to offer complete in-vehicle
electronic syst-ems.
This year LCI expects sales of Dollars 110m, rising to Dollars 140m next
year. In 1993 it had pre-tax profits of Dollars 5.7m and net assets of
Dollars 23.2m. LCI works on eight sites and employs 1,370 people.
