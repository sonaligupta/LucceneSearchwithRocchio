Espiritu Santo

ESPIRITO Santo Financial Holding, one of the largest financial groups in
Portugal, yesterday reported a 52.3 per cent rise in first-half consolidated
income to Dollars 19.5m.
The group said the increase was due to a higher percentage of ownership in
Banco Espirito Santo, higher non-interest income from banking and related
activities, improved insurance results, as well as the effects of a strict
cost control programme.
At the same time, growth of net income was adversely affected by the
strength of the US dollar against European countries.
