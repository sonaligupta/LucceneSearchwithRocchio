FT  12 APR 94 / Water suppliers 'will issue bonds'


   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent


Water companies are expected to raise several billion pounds from the bond
markets to finance their capital spending, a leading environmental
investment house has said.
Mr David Owen, analyst at Ecofin, said that the tighter the price controls
imposed by Ofwat, the water regulator, the greater the amount companies
would seek to raise from the bond markets.
Next month Ofwat will tell the water companies in England and Wales the rate
at which they will be allowed to raise prices between 1995 and 2005.
Mr Ian Byatt, director-general of Ofwat, has been concerned that the cost of
complying with new environmental regulations means that water bills will
continue to rise much faster than inflation.
According to industry estimates, capital spending could amount to Pounds
40bn this decade. The companies have indicated to Ofwat that they want
annual price increases of 6 per cent a year on average to pay for these
improvements.
Mr Owen is preparing a report on the treatment of sewage sludge, one of the
most expensive parts of this programme. He said: 'The likelihood of lots of
rights issues (to pay for this spending) is low.'
Companies could be deterred from issuing shares to raise cash because
'institutions have been putting immense pressure on them to keep up dividend
growth', he said. But he still expected companies to issue shares for
acquisitions.
According to Ecofin's calculations, the outflow of cash from the 10 large
water and sewerage companies has been between Pounds 1bn and Pounds 1.5bn a
year since the year ending March 1992.
In the year ending March 1995 Mr Owen expects the cash outflow to be Pounds
956m.
