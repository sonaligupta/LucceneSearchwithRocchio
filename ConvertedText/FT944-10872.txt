FT  09 NOV 94 / Argentine budget deal curbs Cavallo


   By DAVID PILLING

Mr Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's combative economy minister, may fail to win
extra powers he sought to cut public expenditure following a pact by
governing Peronist and opposition deputies.
The agreement, which should clear the path for congressional approval of the
1995 budget within 10 days, excludes from the package an article that would
have given Mr Cavallo additional powers to push through privatisations and
cut state bureaucracy.
Mr Cavallo had hoped article 14 - which included authority to merge or
eliminate state bodies and to cut the number of public employees - would
have saved the treasury about Dollars 1bn next year. But many congressmen
were reluctant to grant Mr Cavallo powers to bypass the legislative branch.
The issue has taken on particular relevance because of the emergence in the
third quarter of a budget deficit, the first in more than two years. Mr
Cavallo has sought to blame the deficit on growing pensions payments, but
many commentators argue that fiscal laxity in other areas explains much of
the deterioration.
The deficit has forced Mr Cavallo to ask Congress to amend the 1994 budget,
granting extra expenditure of Dollars 1.3bn to meet pensions and bonuses
over the next two months.
