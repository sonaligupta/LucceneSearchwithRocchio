FT  19 APR 91 / International Company News: BankAmerica underlines strength
of recovery


   By BERNARD SIMON


   NEW YORK


FIRST-QUARTER earnings of BankAmerica have confirmed that the San
Francisco-based group which was almost on its knees four years ago is now
one of the strongest banks in the US.
BankAmerica, the biggest West Coast bank, lifted earnings slightly to
Dollars 282m, or Dollars 1.24 a share, from Dollars 278m, or Dollars 1.23, a
year earlier. Net interest income grew by 10 per cent to Dollars 1.1bn. Fee
and other non-interest income was up 7 per cent, thanks to higher profits
and commissions from securities and foreign exchange trading.
Although return on assets and on common equity fell by 8 and 13 per cent
respectively in the first quarter, these ratios - at 1.02 and 18.9 per cent
 -are still among the highest for the big US banks.
BankAmerica also has one of the strongest capital positions, with a ratio of
common equity to assets of 5.4 per cent. Total assets stood at Dollars
111.9bn on March 31, up from Dollars 101.1bn a year earlier.
Ironically, BankAmerica owes much of its good fortune to the difficulties of
the mid-1980s. A radical restructuring has returned it to its California
roots, while sharply cutting back staff and other overheads.
'They got their wake-up call early,' says Mr Richard Fredericks, banking
analyst at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco.
BankAmerica's share price has soared almost six-fold since the depths of the
1987 crisis. It lost Dollars  7/8 yesterday, however, to close at Dollars 38
5/8 .
Nonetheless, the group has not been immune from the recession and the
property slump. Total non-accrual assets of Dollars 3.1bn on March 31 were
virtually unchanged from three months earlier, but the property and
construction component jumped to Dollars 740m from Dollars 551m. The
non-accrual portion of the bank's loans for highly-leveraged deals jumped to
Dollars 257m from Dollars 140m.
Net credit losses surged to Dollars 447m in the first quarter from Dollars
132m in the previous three months, and Dollars 48m last time. Excluding
third world debt, the increase was due largely to a Dollars 53m increase in
write-offs of consumer loans, especially on credit cards, and to lower bad
debt recoveries.
BankAmerica has expanded its operations in New Mexico and Arizona, partly
through the acquisition of savings and loan assets from the Resolution Trust
Corp. The group now has retail networks in eight western states.
Despite the addition of 2,900 employees as a result of the first-quarter
acquisitions, the total staff complement of 55,100 is virtually unchanged
from a year ago.
