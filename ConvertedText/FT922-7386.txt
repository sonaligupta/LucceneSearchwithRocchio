FT  19 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Baris near Pounds 1m loss after provisions


Reduced profitability and heavy provisions against contracts in Spain and
the UK have pushed Baris Holdings, the fire protection and dry lining
specialist, into a pre-tax loss of Pounds 948,000 for the year ended
February 1992.
That represented a Pounds 3.18m downturn on the Pounds 2.23m pre-tax profit
of the previous year.
Accordingly, the directors are not recommending a final dividend, leaving
the 2p interim as the year's total (6.6p). Losses per share were 13.3p
(earnings 20.2p).
Mr Robert Smith, chairman, said the company suffered from recession in the
UK construction market and the dispute on the Vila Olimpica project in
Barcelona, and had made exceptional provisions of Pounds 1.8m for contracts.
Also, the company entered a borrowing position with net interest charges of
Pounds 149,000, against income of Pounds 119,000, as it experienced a
lengthening period of debtor collection.
Mr Smith said the second half performance was creditable in that turnover
was Pounds 12m (out of a total of Pounds 23.2m) and generated an operating
profit of Pounds 618,000.
