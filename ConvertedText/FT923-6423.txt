FT  25 AUG 92 / Lebanese Speaker claims vote-rigging


   By REUTER


MR Hussein Husseini, the Pro-Syrian Speaker of the Lebanese parliament,
resigned yesterday, accusing his political opponents of vote-rigging, Reuter
reports.
Earlier, the Shia Moslem speaker urged the government to scrap Sunday's
polls in his east Lebanon district after the pro-Iranian Hizbollah (Party of
God) took a commanding lead in Lebanon's first general election in 20 years.
Mr Husseini accused the group of rigging votes.
Interior Minister Sami al-Khatib dismissed a request that counting be
suspended in the Bekaa Valley's Baalbek district where Mr Husseini, a
traditional leader in the largely Shia area, headed a list of 10 pro-Syrian
candidates.
