FT  27 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Redrow's 45% advance confirms housing
recovery


   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE


The continuing recovery among UK housebuilders was confirmed yesterday when
Redrow Group, which came to the market earlier this year, reported annual
pre-tax profits 45 per cent ahead at Pounds 19.2m, against Pounds 13.2m.
However, Mr Steve Morgan, chairman, said it was too early to forecast a
sustained recovery. 'Trading conditions are fairly neutral at the moment.
The house price rises we saw earlier in the year have subsided, but so too
have some of the inflationary cost pressures.'
Turnover increased 45 per cent to Pounds 188.3m (Pounds 129.6m), including
Pounds 2.8m (Pounds 3m) from discontinued activities. Earnings per share
rose from 5.1p to 8p. An initial dividend of 1.8p is proposed.
The pre-tax figure was struck after a Pounds 3.1m (Pounds 600,000) charge
for the leisure division, which was sold to Mr Morgan prior to flotation,
and a Pounds 1m investment profit.
The number of completed homes rose 61 per cent to 2,038, which included a
first contribution of 451 from the group's new south-eastern division, the
former Costain Homes business, bought in July 1993. The purchase marked the
company's return to the south-east. Mr Morgan said the region remained a
priority for expansion, as witnessed by the recent purchase of Gudgeon Homes
for Pounds 4.6m.
He added that the company was also considering a move into Scotland, the
only area of the UK where it had no presence.
First-time buyer incentives, particularly in the south-east, meant the
average house price declined from Pounds 88,000 to Pounds 82,400. However,
Mr Morgan said that he expected prices to recover this year, although it was
too early to make a firm prediction.
On turnover of Pounds 168m (Pounds 111m) the home division reported
operating profits of Pounds 22.3m (Pounds 13.3m).
The land bank rose from 5,000 to 7,100 plots, which was 79 per cent higher
in value terms at Pounds 89.7m. Although land prices had risen during the
year, the company had managed to secure most of its purchases at below
market prices.
Turnover in the construction business rose 48 per cent to Pounds 15.8m,
although operating profits halved to Pounds 100,000 and the operating margin
fell from 1.9 per cent to 0.6 per cent.
With trading conditions continuing to be tough, the company was taking steps
to rationalise the division.
COMMENT
Good first year results from Redrow come at a time when many investors, with
an eye on higher interest rate expectations, are reducing their weighting in
the construction and builders sectors. Forecasts for the current year have
been shaved back to about Pounds 28m, giving an earnings of 9.8p and a p/e
of about 13. This is slightly ahead of the market and a 10 per cent premium
to the sector and higher than the likes of Bryant and Wilson Bowden, both of
which have track records.
