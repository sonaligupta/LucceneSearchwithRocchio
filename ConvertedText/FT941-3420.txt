FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Owen & Robinson price rises on reports of
stake acquisition move


   By ANDREW BOLGER


Shares in Owen & Robinson, the gold jewellery and sports footwear retailer,
rose 8p to 34p yesterday after a report that a stake in the group might be
taken by Mr Philip Green, the controversial former chairman and chief
executive of Amber Day, the discount retailer.
Mr Green said last night: 'At this moment, I have bought no shares.' It is
understood, however, that Mr Green has had talks with Mr Maurice Dwek, a
former chairman of Owen & Robinson, who still owns 15.8 per cent of its
shares.
Mr Green declined to comment on any possible talks, but said: 'I always look
at interesting situations. If it's the right deal at the right time, I might
look at it.'
Mr Steve Foot, Owen & Robinson's finance director, said of Mr Green: 'If
he's buying shares, he hasn't done so yet.'
Mr Green stepped down in September, 1992, from Amber Day, which has since
been renamed the WEW Group. He left with a Pounds 1.13m golden handshake
after a deluge of adverse press coverage was followed by results well below
analysts' expectations. Mr Green also received Pounds 7.6m from selling his
stake in the group.
