FT  08 JUN 92 / Tokyo tussle over UN peace force bill

JAPANESE opposition parties have held up passage of the controversial United
Nations peacekeeping bill by a marathon display of filibustering,
culminating in a slow voting technique called the 'ox-walk', writes Stefan
Wagstyl in Tokyo.
Exhausted members of the Diet's upper house were last night preparing for a
fourth consecutive all-night session as party leaders argued over the bill,
which would allow Japanese troops to join UN peacekeeping operations. The
bill has divided the country, with supporters wanting Japan to play a bigger
world role and opponents fearful of expanding the military's role. The
ruling Liberal Democratic Party, which forced the bill through the Diet's
lower house last year, hopes today to overcome intense opposition in the
upper house from left-wing parties.
