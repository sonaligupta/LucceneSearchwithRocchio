FT  12 MAR 93 / The Taurus Collapse: Lamont is handed Pounds 800m windfall


   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor


THE DECISION to abandon Taurus should provide Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, with windfall savings of about Pounds 800m a year, but should
not result in any last-minute alteration to his Budget plans.
In the 1990 Budget, Mr John Major, who was then chancellor, announced plans
to abolish the 0.5 per cent stamp duty on share transactions to coincide
with the introduction of Taurus. But in January this year, as the chancellor
began planning next Tuesday's Budget, the Stock Exchange said it would not
be 'going live' with the settlement system until April 1994.
That means Mr Lamont will have been able to factor the revenues from stamp
duty into his Budget planning for the coming financial year. The Treasury
had already become used to repeated delays in the promised introduction of
the system.
Treasury officials estimate that stamp duty on share transactions produces
between Pounds 800m and Pounds 900m in a financial year - equivalent to
about  1/2 a percentage point on the basic 25 per cent rate of income tax.
Stamp duty yielded Pounds 1.7bn in 1991-92 of which roughly 50 per cent came
from share transfers. Stamp duty is expected to yield less - Pounds 1.39bn -
in the current financial year. That is because the temporary suspension of
stamp duty payments on most house sales between December 1991 and last
August cost the government an estimated Pounds 290m in 1992-93.
Mr Lamont's exact plans for stamp duty in 1993-94 and after April 1994 are
shrouded in pre-Budget secrecy. Other European Community countries have been
removing stamp duty from share transactions, partly because a draft EC
directive in 1986 suggested such action.
The directive, however, was not adopted and the UK government is under no
obligation to follow suit.
