FT  13 MAR 92 / Palestinian gunman shot during Israeli crackdown


   By REUTER


   JERUSALEM


An Israeli soldier points his rifle at a Palestinian man in bed in the town
of Jenin yesterday during a crackdown on armed militants in the occupied
West Bank, official military sources said yesterday, Reuter reports from
Jerusalem. The soldiers killed a Palestinian gunman and wounded three in the
two-day action. Dozens were detained in the search-and-arrest operation in
the area of Jenin, a flashpoint of armed clashes between Israeli troops and
Palestinians. Residents were confined to their homes under a curfew order.
The operation appeared to be a response to recent Palestinian attacks.
