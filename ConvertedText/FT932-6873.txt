FT  26 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Thorn EMI pleases


   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON and PETER JOHN


Results at the top end of market expectations sent Thorn EMI ahead 26 to
856p. There was also an element of relief that the figures dispelled some of
the worries overhanging the stock in recent months. These have included
concern over the effect of a US inquiry into rental business, and most
lately over the official UK inquiry into compact disc prices.
Those troubles were largely forgotten yesterday as a welter of upgrades and
buy recommendations were disclosed. In particular, the contribution of
Virgin Records, bought last year, defied the more cautious expectations.
Mr Hamish Dickson at Hoare Govett said: 'One of the most attractive aspects
is Thorn's continuing ability to increase its margins in its music
business.' Analysts upgraded profits forecasts to a range of Pounds 360m to
Pounds 385m for 1993-94.
