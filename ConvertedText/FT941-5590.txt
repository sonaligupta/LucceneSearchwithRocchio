FT  05 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Henlys recovers and seeks Pounds 26m


   By PAUL TAYLOR


Henlys Group, the motor trading and bus and coach manufacturing and
distribution company, plans to raise Pounds 25.8m through a 1-for-4 rights
issue at 280p.
The group, which yesterday also reported 1993 results showing a profits
turnround and a raised final dividend, said proceeds would be used to
strengthen the balance sheet and to expand the core motor division, both
organically and through acquisition. The shares rose 7p to 352p.
Higher new and used car sales and a turnround in the bus and coach business
underpinned the recovery. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.31m compared with a
restated loss of Pounds 2.08m in 1992 when the group was hit by Pounds 2.18m
of exceptional charges, including costs of fighting off a hostile takeover
bid from T Cowie.
Turnover grew by 12 per cent to Pounds 372.2m (Pounds 331.1m), led by the
motor division which lifted sales from Pounds 265.3m to Pounds 306m.
Operating profits more than doubled to Pounds 9.17m (Pounds 3.8m) with the
motor side contributing Pounds 7.28m (Pounds 5.77m), largely as a result of
improved trading.
New vehicle volumes increased by 18 per cent with retail sales up 13 per
cent, while used car volumes grew by 19 per cent.
Coach manufacturing and sales operations recorded an Pounds 1.89m operating
profit, compared with a Pounds 1.97m loss, on turnover little changed at
Pounds 66.2m (Pounds 65.9m). Yesterday the group acquired from Charterhouse
Development the 50 per cent of the Roadlease Contracts financing business
which it did not already own for Pounds 50,000.
Pre-tax profits were further boosted by a Pounds 250,000 gain on property
disposals, a Pounds 286,000 (Pounds 257,000) share of profits of Roadlease
and a sharp reduction in net interest costs, which fell to Pounds 2.4m
(Pounds 3.95m), reflecting lower interest rates and reduced borrowings.
Net borrowings fell by Pounds 9.7m to Pounds 16.1m at end-December,
representing gearing of 32 per cent. Proceeds of the rights issue, fully
underwritten by Charterhouse, will be used to virtually eliminate term debt,
reducing gearing to about 2 per cent.
Panmure Gordon is stockbroker to the issue.
COMMENT
Although the resurgence of the car market has helped, Henlys' management
deserves credit for steering the group back to profit. Although some 80 per
cent of group profits now come from sources other than new cars, forecourt
sales still drive the rest of the motor business. The rights issue is well
timed and deserves support since it should enable the group to fully
capitalise on the recovering market and to expand geographically through
acquisitions. Pre-tax profits could reach about Pounds 11.7m this year
producing earnings of 19p and the board is predicting 7.5p of dividends. The
shares have gained almost 250p over the past 12 months and now trade on a
prospective p/e of 18.5.
