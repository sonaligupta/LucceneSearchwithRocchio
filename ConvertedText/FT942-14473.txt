FT  20 APR 94 / Chrysler record shows strength of US recovery


   By MARTIN DICKSON


   NEW YORK


Chrysler yesterday underscored the strong recovery taking place in the US
vehicle market with a 77 per cent increase in underlying first-quarter
earnings and its most profitable quarter ever.
However, the results were only a little ahead of the Wall Street forecast
and Chrysler shares slid to Dollars 48 7/8 at lunchtime, down Dollars 2 1/4
.
Chrysler is the smallest of Detroit's Big Three motor manufacturers and the
first to report first-quarter figures.
Rivals General Motors and Ford are also expected to announce big
improvements in earnings, thanks to a boom in US sales of both cars, which
were up 15.5 per cent in the first quarter, and light trucks, which rose
22.9 per cent.
Chrysler, which faced financial difficulties in the early 1990s, has
benefited in particular from its range of new models, improvements in
production efficiency, and its strength in high margin products, such as
mini-vans and four-wheel drive sports utility vehicles.
The company reported net earnings of Dollars 938m (Pounds 642m), or Dollars
2.55 a share, compared with Dollars 530m, or Dollars 1.57 a share in the
same period of last year, excluding a Dollars 4.9bn non-cash charge taken in
1993 for a change in accounting practice. Sales and revenues rose from
Dollars 10.9bn to Dollars 13.2bn. Until now, Chrysler's highest quarterly
net earnings were Dollars 801m, made in the second period of 1984.
The group's first-quarter car sales in the US and Canada rose 8 per cent to
243,229 units, while truck sales were up 26 per cent at 382,066.
Its overall share of the market was 15.7 per cent, unchanged from the first
quarter of 1993. International sales rose 27 per cent to 28,305, with Europe
up 22 per cent to 16,882.
Chrysler Financial, the financial services arm, had net earnings of Dollars
47m, up from Dollars 37m last year before the effects of accounting changes.
Mr Robert Eaton, chairman, said he saw the steady improvement in industry
sales continuing and this, coupled with the strength of the company's
business, had persuaded Chrysler to approve capacity increases and new
hirings over the next three years. Chrysler announced last month it would
spend Dollars 1.8bn on increasing capacity by 500,000 units a year, to 3.5m
vehicles.
