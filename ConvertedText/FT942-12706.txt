FT  28 APR 94 / Observer: Like clockwork


Swiss Reinsurance and Swiss Bank Corporation have long been paired in the
minds of Zurich businessmen as being a little susceptible to the
blandishments of management consultants; they seemed to troop in regularly
to advise on grand restructurings - which, to the untrained eye, never
seemed to amount to a row of beans.
Now the consultants have talked their way into the boardroom on a more
permanent basis. Last November, SBC poached Peter Wuffli, a partner in
McKinsey & Co, Switzerland, to be its chief financial officer.
Yesterday, Swiss Re capped that by hiring Lukas Muhlemann, McKinsey's Swiss
managing director, as its next chief executive. With such professional
reorganisers in-house, how ever will they find time for the business?
