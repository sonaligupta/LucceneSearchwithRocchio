FT  27 JUL 92 / Study eases VDU fear


   By LISA WOOD


FEARS that pregnant women working with visual display units are at increased
risk of miscarrying have been eased by research sponsored mainly by the
Health and Safety Executive, Lisa Wood writes.
The research, the first of its kind to be carried out in Britain and which
involved studying the conditions affecting 450 pregnant women, is to be
published in this month's issue of the British Journal of Industrial
Medicine.
Dr Colin Mackay of the HSE said: 'It shows that pregnant women who work,
even habitually, at VDUs are not at increased risk of miscarriage.'
Dr Eve Roman, who led the study, said: 'We found it made no difference
whether a woman worked on a VDU as part of her general day, whether she used
it occasionally or whether her only contact with a VDU was that it happened
to be in the same room.'
