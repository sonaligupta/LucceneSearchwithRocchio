FT  30 NOV 94 / International Company News: Thai Airways ahead sharply in
year

Net profit for Thai Airways International surged 206 per cent in the year
ending on September 30, climbing to Bt3.117bn (Dollars 124.5m) from
Bt1.02bn, writes William Barnes in Bangkok. The national carrier's
president, Mr Thamnoon Wanglee, said the improved profits showed that a
campaign to improve efficiency was starting to bite.
Earnings per share rose from Bt0.73 to Bt2.23. Mr Thamnoon admitted that
Bt792m of that profit was derived by recognising discounts on aircraft
purchases as income, although he said this widely-criticised method of
boosting profits would not be used again.
He said next year's profits would not suffer because the company had decided
to extend the depreciation period on new aircraft from 12 to 14 years. This
'almost cancels out' that loss of so-called commission fee income, he said.
