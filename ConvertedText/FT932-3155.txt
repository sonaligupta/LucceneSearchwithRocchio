FT  15 JUN 93 / Cash calls on Names deferred


   By RICHARD LAPPER


MORE THAN a dozen Lloyd's of London syndicates are to postpone part or all
of their calls for cash, thereby softening the impact of record losses on
the Names who provide the insurance market's capital.
The market expects to report next week losses of up to Pounds 2.8bn for
1990, its latest underwriting year.
Syndicates delaying calls for cash from Names include Cater Allen 190,
Barder & Marsh 62, Janson Green 79, Bankside 197, Methuen 483, BPC 920, and
Davies 1021. Sturge Holdings, the market's biggest agency, said last weekend
that a number of syndicates it managed would take similar action.
Mr Julian Crispin, chairman of Sedgwick Underwriting Agents, one of the
largest members' agents at Lloyd's, said: 'Some Names will be able to defer
all cash calls for 12 months. It is a very satisfactory development.'
The change is possible because although syndicates must make a full
provision against potential claims, payment is sometimes not made for many
years. Sturge said it had negotiated an arrangement with its bankers whereby
they would provide a contingency line of credit if payment became due
earlier than expected.
Meanwhile, it has emerged that five agents may not be prepared to continue
managing syndicates into 1994, three of them as a result of disagreements
over elements of the Lloyd's business plan introduced in April.
Charman Underwriting Agency, Knightstone Holdings, Christofferson Heath,
Atrium Underwriting, and Hardy all gave notice to members' agents before the
end of last month.
Several of the agencies are opposed to the imposition of an across-the-board
maximum agency fee of 0.5 per cent.
Mr Roger Heath, chairman of Christofferson Heath, which manages two of the
market's largest motor syndicates, said his agency faced a sharp fall in
income as a result of the changes to the fee structure.
The agency charges Names a fee of 1.75 per cent to help it meet higher
expenses associated with motor underwriting.
