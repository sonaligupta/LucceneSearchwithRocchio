FT  29 JAN 92 / International Company News: Marine Midland cuts loss to
Dollars 23.8m


   By SIMON HOLBERTON


   HONG KONG


MARINE Midland Banks, the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank's troubled US
subsidiary, yesterday reported a fourth-quarter loss of USDollars 23.8m  -
sharply lower than the USDollars 164.3m loss declared for the last quarter
of 1990.
In announcing the New York-based bank's seventh quarterly loss, Mr John
Bond, Marine Midland's president and chief executive, held out hope that the
result of substantial cost-cutting and rationalisation of the bank's
activities might soon repay shareholders.
'Despite a difficult economic environment and continuing real estate
problems, we see some light at the end of the tunnel and expect considerable
improvement in 1992,' he said.
For the year, Marine Midland posted an after-tax loss of Dollars 189.9m,
compared with a loss for 1990 of Dollars 295.6m.
This is relatively good news, however, for Hongkong Bank's profits, as any
improvements in Marine Midland's performance should flow through to higher
earnings for its parent. Hongkong Bank is due to report its 1991 results in
March.
Marine Midland ended the year with a tier-one capital ratio of 7.66 per
cent. During the September quarter, Hongkong Bank injected Dollars 200m of
additional capital into the bank. In May 1990, the bank injected Dollars
300m into its ailing subsidiary.
Over the past two years, Hongkong Bank has embarked upon a policy of
down-sizing Marine Midland's operations in the US. It has given up all
pretentions to be a money centre bank and is now concentrating on retail
banking and lending to small and medium-sized businesses in up-state New
York and the north-east generally.
It has virtually eliminated its exposure to LDC debt, has withdrawn from
vehicle financing, and is now taking a tougher line on real estate lending.
These policies are reflected in Marine Midland's balance sheet, which
contracted from Dollars 20.1bn in 1990 to Dollars 16.9bn at the end of 1991.
However, whether Marine Midland will ever be the investment bank hoped for
is doubtful. By concentrating on the north-east of the US, it has opted for
the role of a regional provider of finance - in a region not noted for its
sparkling economic prospects.
