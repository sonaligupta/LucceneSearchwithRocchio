FT  06 NOV 93 / BZW top in gilt trader profits


   By SARA WEBB


BARCLAYS de Zoete Wedd, the securities house, made a pre-tax profit of
Pounds 37.17m from its gilt-edged marketmaking operations in 1992.
This makes BZW, for the fourth consecutive year, the biggest profit earner
that trades UK government bonds - known as gilts.
Last year was an exceptionally good one for the 19 gilt-edged market-makers,
normally known as Gemms: most of them benefited from the strong rally in
gilt prices, the decline in interest rates and heavy issues of gilts.
Gilt yields fell dramatically, particularly after the Conservative general
election victory and again after sterling left the European exchange rate
mechanism.
The combined post-tax profit for the Gemms jumped to Pounds 65m in 1992  -
their most profitable year since Big Bang in 1986 - against Pounds 49m in
1991 and Pounds 40m in 1990, according to the Bank of England. The prospect
of earning good profits has encouraged houses such as Yamaichi of Japan and
Merrill Lynch of the US to apply for Gemm status.
With post-tax profits of Pounds 24.55m last year, BZW clearly accounted for
the lion's share. It is credited with employing a broad range of trading
tactics which enabled it to spread its risks.
Mr David Gelber, chief operating officer at Midland Global Markets, said:
'When you have the combination of more issuance plus a reasonably bullish
interest rate scenario, it's good for the gilt market and for Gemms.'
Midland's gilt-edged marketmaking operations made a pre-tax profit of Pounds
10.6m last year, sharply up from Pounds 3.5m in 1991.
BZW's gilt-edged operations also include its Eurosterling and Ecu government
bond business, while some other houses only include their UK government bond
business in the figures.
Several of those in the gilt-edged market expect 1993 to be as profitable as
1992 and possibly even better given the continued rally in the gilt market,
the decline in interest rates, the prospect of continued low inflation, and
strong demand by overseas investors for UK and other European government
bonds.
However, some Gemms speculate that BZW may find its position challenged by
US securities houses such Salomon Brothers, Goldman Sachs, and Lehman
Brothers, reflecting the growing importance of US business.
Salomon Brothers made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 14.1m on its gilt
operations last year.
One gilt strategist said: 'This year there has been a fundamental shift in
the kind of business seen in the gilt market.'
US investors have been keen to diversify in the search for higher yields
while US hedge funds (which employ a range of complex and technical trading
strategies and which often trade very large amounts of stock) have been
significant participants in the European and UK government bond markets.
A gilt trader said: 'The US securities houses have had a huge competitive
advantage.'
