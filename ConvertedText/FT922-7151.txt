FT  20 MAY 92 / International Company News: Daimler-Benz shows 14% advance
in net profits

DAIMLER-Benz, the German motor, aerospace and electronics group, expects an
'excellent result' this year after a strong performance in the first
quarter, Mr Edzard Reuter, chief executive, said yesterday.
Net profits in the first three months were 14 per cent higher at DM480m
(Dollars 291m), with turnover gaining 16 per cent to DM22bn. Business growth
was faster abroad than at home.
Mr Reuter said turnover for the full year would total around DM100bn,
compared with DM95bn last year, a rise of 11 per cent on 1990.
The group's figures for 1991 show that Mercedes-Benz, the car and truck
subsidiary, remains the chief profit-earner for the group, in spite of the
costly diversifications of the 1980s. Mercedes' net profits totalled
DM1.5bn, roughly the same as the previous year.
One company into which Daimler diversified, the AEG electrical and
electronics company, turned in a sharply higher loss of DM624m, against a
DM205m loss the previous year. This resulted from the DM1bn cost of closing
the heavily loss-making Olympia office equipment division, partly offset by
a DM490m gain on the sale of its cable activities.
Daimler has already announced an 8 per cent rise in group net income to
DM1.9bn - because of inter-company accounting, this figure is not comparable
with divisional results - and its first dividend increase since 1986 with a
payment of DM13, against DM12 a year earlier.
Earnings per share increased from DM36.20 to DM40.20.
However, pre-tax income was 5 per cent lower at DM4bn, with the net result
benefitting from a sharp drop in the tax bill.
For the first time, the group was able to offset against tax losses at AEG
and Dornier, part of its aerospace operation.
Mr Gerhard Liener, finance director, said Mercedes' share of total profits
was higher than its 69 per cent of turnover last year.
In the first quarter, Mercedes' sales advanced by 17 per cent to DM17.1bn,
with most of the growth coming from foreign markets, especially in western
Europe. The waiting time for the new S-class executive model is nine months.
While relieved that an engineering strike had been averted, Mr Reuter said
the settlement would result in an 'excessive wage burden'. Daimler has
already embarked on a streamlining programme to squeeze DM4bn a year from
total costs by 1995. Mr Reuter said around DM2bn of this had been achieved.
He said internal operating profits should double this year, although he gave
no figures. This would largely reflect the rationalisation moves. However,
Daimler will also benefit from the elimination of AEG's losses.
