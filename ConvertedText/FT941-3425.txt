FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: B&J puts pressure on bankers


   By PEGGY HOLLINGER


Brown & Jackson, the discount retailer which has raised Pounds 39m from
shareholders since 1992, yesterday sought to put pressure on its bankers by
warning it could not continue trading unless working capital facilities of
Pounds 14m were agreed soon.
The company's shares fell by 3 3/4 to 2 3/4 p as it revealed substantially
larger than expected losses for 1993 and warned of the difficulties in
negotiations with its bankers.
If working capital facilities for the next 12 months are not secured soon,
the Pounds 6m sale and leaseback transaction which was due to be completed
yesterday cannot go ahead.
Analysts held out little hope of a resolution, at least through the banks,
and said that the group had been expected to make further losses this year.
'B&J has just passed its cash peak,' said Mr William Cullum, analyst with
brokers Panmure Gordon. 'so the banks will get out what they put in.'
The announcement was also a high risk gamble, he suggested. 'If you were a
supplier would you now want to supply B&J? This sort of public disagreement
could be self-fulfilling,' Mr Cullum said.
Mr Ian Gray, the chief executive appointed following a rescue rights issue
in 1992, said the group had 'adequate trading facilities today'. He was
confident that the company would be able to trade until a solution was
found. 'We have a number of options,' he said.
One of the options was investment by a foreign discount retailer, he said.
The group was in discussions with both the retailer and the banks.
Midland Bank is believed to have decided not to provide further facilities
in light of the group's most recent results and its past trading record.
Brown & Jackson unveiled full year losses of Pounds 12.7m (Pounds 6.6m) on
turnover of Pounds 170m (Pounds 167m), against average expectations of an
Pounds 8m deficit.
