FT  22 JUL 94 / Mainland ban on Adams 'unlawful'


Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, was unlawfully banned from the British
mainland to prevent him embarrassing the government by revealing to MPs the
existence of secret talks over Northern Ireland, the High Court heard
yesterday.
The allegation came as lawyers for Mr Adams asked two judges to declare that
the exclusion order made last October under the Prevention of Terrorism
(Temporary Provisions) Act 1989 breached both European and domestic law.
Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, refused to revoke the order in January.
The challenge drew protests from campaigners who accused Mr Adams of
hypocrisy in seeking to use British law to establish his civil rights, while
terrorists denied those rights to others.
Mr Robin Allen, for Mr Adams, said the ban coincided with an invitation to
the Sinn Fein leader from Mr Tony Benn, the Labour MP, to visit parliament
to discuss the political situation in Ulster with MPs.
It prevented him from attending at a time when he might have disclosed the
existence of then secret talks between Sinn Fein and the government.
Mr Allen told Lord Justice Steyn and Mr Justice Kay: 'The government could
have been, or could be, brought down if it were to lose the support of
Unionist MPs.'
He claimed Mr Adams was 'a man of peace'.
Mr Adams' rights as a citizen of the European Union to reside and move
freely within the territory of member states was infringed by a misuse of
anti-terrorism laws, he said.
Government officials denied making the order to avoid political
embarrassment and stated its aim was 'the total banishment' of Mr Adams.
Mr Stephen Richards, for the government, is expected to argue at the hearing
tomorrow that the 'secret talks' allegation is implausible since Mr Adams
could have disclosed the existence of the talks at any time.
