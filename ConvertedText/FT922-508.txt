FT  27 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Exceptional gain helps Southern Water rise
19%


   By ANGUS FOSTER


SOUTHERN Water, which supplies water and sewerage services to the south
coast from Kent to Hampshire, yesterday reported an 19 per cent increase in
pre-tax profits for the year to March 31.
The figure rose from Pounds 97.1m to Pounds 115.1m helped by price increases
and exceptional gains on disposals. Mr William Courtney, chairman, was
delighted with the figures.
Average prices rose 14.7 per cent and there was a Pounds 6m exceptional gain
on the sale of investments in three statutory water companies. However, the
company estimated the recession had cost it Pounds 4m and provisions for bad
debts were doubled to Pounds 5m.
Turnover increased 16 per cent to Pounds 290.7m (Pounds 251.2m), helped by a
75 per cent lift in non-regulated turnover of Pounds 15.5m.
Among the non-core businesses, Southern's 50 per cent stake in Stalwart
Environmental Services was sold to its joint venture partner, SAUR at book
value although provisions of 'a few hundred thousand' were made on the sale,
according to Mr Martyn Webster, group finance director.
Capital expenditure increased 21 per cent to Pounds 171m and the company's
net cash position deteriorated from Pounds 6m to Pounds 1.7m. This, and
lower interest rates, cut net interest received to Pounds 3m (Pounds 6.6m).
Depreciation increased 4.3 per cent to Pounds 29m while infrastructure
renewals were 4.5 per cent higher at Pounds 16.1m.
The tax charge, for advance corporation tax, held steady at Pounds 9.8m and
was helped by last year's introduction of a scrip dividend option, which
saved about Pounds 1m.
Earnings increased 20 per cent to 64.2p (53.4p). A final dividend of 13p
(11.8p) is proposed to make a total of 19.5p (17.7p), an increase of 10 per
cent.
The shares gained 4p to 410p.
COMMENT
These figures, although bang in line with expectations, are slightly better
than they look. Even stripping out the exceptionals, pre-tax profits have
grown 12.4 per cent. That is high compared with the rest of the sector, and
would have been better still without the heavier-than-expected effects of
recession and bad debts. Most of the benefits seem to have flowed from good
cost control and cash management. Growth this year will be more muted as
Southern goes from net cash to net debt and misses out on exceptionals.
Forecast profits of Pounds 120m put the shares on 6.2 times, which is a
touch high relative to its peers, with a yield of 6.5. Although Southern
might provide no haven for aficionados of excitement, it is a safe medium
term bet.
