FT  29 APR 94 / World Trade News: Gatt to probe steel complaint


   By FRANCES WILLIAMS


   GENEVA


Gatt's subsidies committee yesterday agreed to establish an independent
disputes panel on a complaint from Brussels that the US breached fair trade
rules in imposing anti-subsidy duties on carbon steel flat products from six
EU member states.
The duties were imposed definitively last August on exports from, among
others, France, Britain and Germany. The EU disputes the US subsidy
calculations, such as the inclusion of payments to redundant steel workers.
The panel is the second to be established by the committee to investigate US
countervailing duties slapped on steel imports last year.
The duties followed a wave of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy suits filed by
American steel producers in 1992, after a voluntary export restraint
arrangement expired. Most, though not all, of the suits were later thrown
out.
The subsidies committee also adopted two panel reports, one on Norwegian
salmon exports to the US and the other on Brazilian milk exports to the EU.
However, an attempt by the chairman of the committee, Mr Ole Lundby of
Norway, to secure adoption of several much older panel reports met with less
success.
