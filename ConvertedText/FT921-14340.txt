FT  16 JAN 92 / Directors urge Pounds 3bn reduction in taxation


   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff


TAX CUTS of Pounds 3bn and a freeze on business rates and would stimulate
business investment and nudge the economy towards recovery, the Institute of
Directors said yesterday in Budget recommendations to Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor.
I urged him to make cuts in in corporation, capital-gains and investment
taxes the Budget's priority. It urged a freeze in excise duties on vehicles,
alcohol and tobacco and a halt to increases in the uniform business rate to
speed up the battle for zero inflation.
Mr Peter Morgan, director-general of the IOD said: 'Government spending
plans for 1992-93 have pre-empted any large reduction in the overall tax
burden this year, but we believe there is still scope for a Pounds
2bn-Pounds 3bn cut targeted at rebuilding the private sector's capital
base.'
Proposals included a 20 per cent reduction in inheritance tax with the
threshold raised to Pounds 300,000; the abolition of capital gains tax; a 32
per cent cut in corporation tax on 1991-92 profits and a 31 per cent cut on
1992-93 profits.
