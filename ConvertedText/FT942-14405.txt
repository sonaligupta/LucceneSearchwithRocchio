FT  20 APR 94 / International Company News: Better gold price lifts
Anglovaal

The continued improvement in the rand gold price helped compensate for lower
yields in the Anglovaal group's four gold producers, as after tax profit for
the quarter to end-March increased to R70m (Dollars 19.1m)) from R67.1m in
the preceding three months.
The group's mines received an average price of R41,525 a kg compared with
R39,691 in the December quarter.
Total gold output declined slightly to 10,162kg from 10,609kg.
The bulk of profits again came from group flagship Hartebeestfontein, which
raised its taxed income to R62.9m in the quarter, despite a dip in yield and
higher unit costs.
The results were helped by the state's share of profit no longer being
payable in the January quarter.
Loraine, the group's marginal mine, continued to struggle. After-tax profit
dropped to R440,000 following a R2.9m profit in the previous quarter as the
mine suffered from a decline in output when its continuous work week had to
be broken for the Christmas holidays.
The amount of gold produced declined to 1,454kg from 1,535kg.
Eastern Transvaal Consolidated boosted working profit to R10.3m from R9.2m
but taxed income declined to R5.9m from R6.1m in the previous quarter,
largely as a result of an increased tax burden,
The group's smallest producer, Village Main, benefited from its lack of
forward commitments and improved profit after capital expenditure was
reduced to R799,000 from R671,000.
Chief executive Mr Rob Wilson said that he was generally satisfied with the
group's performance but stressed the need for further cost containment at
Eastern Transvaal Consolidated.
He added that he was optimistic that the situation at Loraine would soon
improve once technical problems had been solved and recently uncovered
higher grade ore could be properly exploited.
The company continued to make extensive use of hedging, but Mr Wilson noted
that the additional use of gold option transactions, which allow mines to
receive 70 per cent of any further increase in the rand spot price, gave the
group greater flexibility in dealing with price fluctuations.
