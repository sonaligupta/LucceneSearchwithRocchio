   By WILLIAM WEAVER


A LITTLE Gentle Sleuthing by Betty Rowlands (Hodder & Stoughton, Pounds
11.95. 269 pages) is a first novel by a clearly gifted and knowledgeable
writer. The book is not without its flaws - a few too many red herrings -
but it is never less than engaging and readable.
Familiar situation: city woman, on her own takes a country cottage to lead a
new and quiet life. Well, you can imagine how quiet that life proves to be.
The rural sitting is generously and effectively described, and there is a
good assortment of minor characters.
Make a note of the name: Betty Rowlands.
