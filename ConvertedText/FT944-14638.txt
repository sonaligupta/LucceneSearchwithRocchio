FT  21 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei advances as Hong
Kong halts slide

   TOKYO


Buying by arbitrageurs and public funds supported share prices, and the
Nikkei 225 average gained ground after moving within a tight trading range,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index rose 123.03, closing at the day's best of 19,991.90 after a low of
19,875.28. Corporate and overseas investors were also seen buying a broad
range of stocks.
Volume came to 270m shares, against 230m. Traders said investors will remain
inactive until the Japan Tobacco listing next week. Payments for the second
round of subscriptions were due yesterday, but a Japanese broker said
investor interest was low, with around only one in 10 investors paying for
the stock.
Meanwhile, some Japanese brokers were relieved that overseas investors
seemed to have started to return to the Tokyo market. Mr Jason James,
strategist at James Capel, commented: 'Foreigners are bearish about other
markets, including those in the US and continental Europe, and they are
shifting some of their funds to Japan.'
The Topix index of all first section stocks put on 8.24 at 1,588.71 and the
Nikkei 300 gained 1.78 at 290.72. Rises led declines by 568 to 417, with 186
issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.55 to 1,304.52.
Steels rose on corporate and public fund buying. Nippon Steel, the day's
most active issue, firmed Y3 to Y390. Speculative buying supported photo
film maker Konica, which added Y16 at Y762, and Pacific Metals climbed Y24
to Y512.
High-technology stocks, which had lost ground on Wednesday on the higher
yen, were bought. However, Matsushita Electric Industrial shed Y10 to Y1,610
on reports of its dispute with the management of MCA, its US movie studio
affiliate.
Sega Enterprises, the video game maker, dipped Y50 to Y4,850 on continued
profit-taking, while construction issues were also lower.
DDI, the long-distance telecommunications operator, rose Y1,000 to Y898,000
in spite of reports of a planned rights issue to raise Y50bn. Other telecom
shares were also higher, with Japan Telecom up Y50,000 to Y3.88m and Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone adding Y12,000 at Y908,000 on foreign buying.
In Osaka, the OSE average improved 35.93 to 22,271.32 in volume of 30.4m
shares.
Roundup
A combination of factors provided renewed strength in some Pacific Rim
markets.
HONG KONG halted a three-day slide as bargain hunters returned, largely
ignoring another tepid government land auction. The Hang Seng index gained
68.72 at 9,388.78, having lost about 230 points earlier in the week.
Hang Seng Bank was ahead HKDollars 2 at HKDollars 55.25 on news that it
planned to redevelop three properties. Swire Pacific, which said an offering
of 30 flats was eight times subscribed, rose HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars 56.
SHANGHAI's A shares soared 10.6 per cent amid renewed hopes that Beijing
would go ahead with plans to boost the market, including providing loans to
brokerages and allowing foreign funds to invest in A shares.
The index advanced 70.90 to 737.53 in greatly enlarged turnover of Yn4.13bn
in what was also seen as a powerful technical rebound after the index lost
around 40 per cent in the previous three weeks. Shenzhen's A index rose 9.81
or 6.4 per cent to 164.00.
TAIPEI was encouraged by comments from the central bank that there was
unlikely to be a further rise in interest rates. The weighted index added
92.27 or 1.4 per cent at 6,761.37. Turnover amounted to TDollars 68.26bn.
Following the government's statement, the overnight interbank rate fell to
6.149 per cent from 7.028 per cent.
Conglomerates led the gains, with President Enterprises up by the 7 per cent
daily limit to TDollars 63.50.
SINGAPORE finished firmer after a late surge in property-related stocks, but
brokers expected the market to resume its consolidation phase. The Straits
Times Industrial index rose 18.14 to end at the day's high of 2,382.25.
Among property issues, DBS Land climbed 16 cents to a new peak of SSDollars
5 in active trade on speculation that the company planned a new condominium
project which would contribute to pre-tax profits of about SDollars 700m.
SEOUL saw institutional profit-taking in large-capitalisation issues which
pulled the composite stock index 5.99 lower to 1,088.77.
Daewoo Heavy gained Won200 at Won16,300, recouping a decline of Won600 in
early trading. New Daewoo Heavy shares were issued as a result of its merger
with Daewoo Shipbuilding and Heavy Machinery.
BOMBAY was held back by sustained selling pressure which left the BSE
30-share index 47.48 lower at 4,281.99 as speculators off-loaded holdings in
A group or specified shares.
Brokers said that the selling pressure was expected to continue in coming
days because many domestic and foreign financial institutions were making
private placements in about 40 Indian companies that were raising funds from
the primary market.
SYDNEY made a late recovery, having been depressed for most of the session.
The All Ordinaries index finished 2.9 ahead at 2,016.3 in turnover of
ADollars 466m. The index had moved between 2,018.3 and 2,003.3.
Brokers remarked that some offshore selling of resource stocks was being
seen following their outperformance against industrials since the middle of
the year.
BHP was 4 cents firmer at ADollars 19.88, and in the resource sector MIM
moved up 8 cents to ADollars 2.78. News Corp retreated 8 cents to ADollars
8.42.
BANGKOK firmed on buying of bank stocks, and the SET index improved 20.19 or
1.34 per cent to end at the day's high of 1,521.61. Turnover was heavy at
Bt9.17bn.
Investors bought banks in the morning after Krung Thai Bank reported a 75.2
per cent rise in net profits in the third quarter to Bt2.4bn. The stock
finished Bt3.50 higher at Bt88, while Bangkok Bank advanced Bt10 to Bt228.
The banking sector was the biggest gainer, rising 3.42 per cent on Bt3.8bn
turnover.
Traders noted that foreigners had been accumulating stocks in anticipation
of good third-quarter corporate results.
MANILA succumbed to profit-taking, ending a six-day rally that had brought
the index back above the 3,000 level. The composite index lost 22.22 at
3,077.12.
Blue chips led declines, with Meralco A falling 2.50 pesos to 282.50 and San
Miguel B dipping 1 peso to 139.
