FT  10 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Honda Motor cuts earnings
forecasts once more

HONDA Motor, the Japanese car maker, yesterday further slashed its earnings
estimate for the year to end-March in response to weakening sales at home
and abroad.
Honda said its consolidated after-tax profits would be just Y63.1bn (Dollars
505.6m), against Y76.27bn last year and an earlier forecast of Y80.1bn for
this year.
The company said the revised forecast was due to weakening vehicle markets,
the long US recession and the slowdown of the Japanese economy. The results
would also be affected by a rise in the cost of sales due to intense
competition. Sales were projected at Y4,428.4bn, a rise of about 3 per cent.
Japanese vehicle sales and exports for the 1991 calendar year fell by 4.3
per cent to 1.34m and were expected to decline marginally this year.
The biggest area of decline was in Honda's exports from Japan, which fell by
7.4 per cent to 662,409 units. Domestic car sales have held up well, partly
because of the recent successful launch of the company's new Civic model.
Overseas production is expected to pick up from 653,000 units in 1991 to
672,000 this year.
Parent company net profits are expected to fall by 32 per cent to Y35.3bn,
with sales up from Y2,800bn to Y2,917bn.
