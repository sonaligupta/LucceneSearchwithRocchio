FT  11 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading


   By JOEL KIBAZO


TURNOVER in stock index futures reached record levels as the derivatives
markets raced forward on news of the Conservative Party victory, writes Joel
Kibazo.
The June contract on the FT-SE opened sharply up but quickly fell back,
despite maintaining a high premium to cash as institutions moved in to
unwind pre-election positions. Dealers reported good business at the 2610
level both from unwound positions and a flurry of overseas buyers that had
waited for the outcome of the election.
A firm Wall Street only served to encourage further buying and, by the
close, turnover had reached a record 21,165 contracts, surpassing the
previous high of 17,052 recorded in October 1989.
June closed at 2,602, up 126 points on the previous close and about 9 points
above its estimated premium to cash of about 22.
Volume in traded options was also very high at 95,767 contracts with a
sizeable amount of arbitrage business recorded. Turnover in the FT-SE option
rose to 51,137 lots, smashing the previous record of 43,973, January 1990.
Thames Water was the busiest stock option. It traded 6,827 contracts in
brisk two-way business.
