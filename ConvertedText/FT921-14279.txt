FT  16 JAN 92 / International Company News: Boise Cascade in red


   By MARTIN DICKSON


   NEW YORK


BOISE CASCADE, the US forest products group, yesterday reported a
fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 15.8m, compared with net income of Dollars
4.8m in the same period of 1990.
The company was hit by depressed prices in its key pulp and paper
businesses.
Boise's net loss worked through at 51 cents a share, against profits of 4
cents in the fourth quarter of 1990.
Results for the latest period included a gain of 61 cents a share from the
sale of its interest in a European corrugated container joint venture.
Sales totalled Dollars 963m, down from Dollars 1bn a year ago.
The company said the fourth quarter was modestly stronger than the third,
and cited four main factors for the weak performance.
One was adverse market conditions, which had driven down prices for all of
the company's grades of pulp and paper over the year.
Another was the high costs of wood in the Pacific north-west, where
environmental pressures to save a species of owl have led to constraints on
timber supplies.
Costs had increased for wood chips to the company's pulp and paper mills.
For the full year, the group reported a net loss of Dollars 79.5m, or
Dollars 2.46 a share, compared with a profit of Dollars 75.3m, or Dollars
1.62, in 1990.
