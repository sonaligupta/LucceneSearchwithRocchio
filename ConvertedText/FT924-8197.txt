FT  12 NOV 92 / Observer: Advising the advisers


If Michael Heseltine really wants to put his own stamp on the Department of
Trade and Industry should he really imitate his predecessor Lord Young by
hiring a deregulation adviser to tackle yet more red tape?
Heseltine's ministry was supposed to be different.
It is over 13 years since a Conservative administration committed to
improving efficiency and eliminating waste in government was first elected,
and over seven years since the first of Lord Young's white papers entitled
'Lifting the burden'.
This led to the setting-up of an advisory panel on deregulation filled with
hard-headed business types and currently headed by Slough Estates' Sir Nigel
Mobbs.
Now Hezza has hired Lord Sainsbury as part of a 'renewed campaign' to tackle
the 'burden of red tape' imposed on business. His role will be
'complementary' to that of Sir Nigel's panel. It sounds like the authorities
are suffering from a surfeit of 'red tape' advisers.
Lord Sainsbury is an excellent businessman. During his 23 years as chairman
of the Sainsbury supermarket chain, profits rose from Pounds 4m to Pounds
628m and market share more than quadrupled.
He is not the sort of person to be taken in by government gimmick. Perhaps
he is being spurred on by the thought that he can do a better job advising
government on how to cut waste than did his old rival Lord Rayner, the
former chairman of Marks & Spencer? After all there is not a lot of love
lost between Britain's two premier retailers and Sainsburys overtook M&S in
terms of sales during Lord Sainsbury's time at the helm.
That said, there has to be a limit to how far an analysis of how to cut red
tape by even Britain's best-run retailers can help the understanding of the
rest of British industry. Supermarket chains with captive domestic markets
do not have to worry about breaking into export markets, for example.
