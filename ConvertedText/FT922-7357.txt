FT  19 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian platinum exports run
wild


   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent


RUSSIA'S PLATINUM export sales went spiralling out of control last year and
reached a record 1.1m troy ounces worth at least USDollars 363m, according
to Johnson Matthey, the world's biggest platinum marketing group.
This was 380,000 ounces or one third up on the previous year when exports
were also extraordinarily high by recent standards.
In 1990 Russia already had begun to run out of gold to sell and turned to
other commodities in a desperate search for hard currencies to prop up its
ailing economy.
However, JM believes that Russia did not expect to have to sell so much
platinum last year. Much of the metal was supposed to be used only as
collateral for loans.
The Soviet Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs had 20 tonnes (643,000 ounces)
of platinum to lend to the market in a particular way - in swap deals which
involved the Bank selling metal to counterparts and promising to buy it back
at an agreed future date.
But towards the end of 1991 it became clear that the old Soviet Union would
split into its component republics and the Bank was orphaned. Western banks
and dealers withdrew its credit lines and the swaps were no longer rolled
forward when they expired.
The Bank had no alternative but to sell the platinum to meet its
obligations.
Mr Jeremy Coombes, author of JM's annual review of the platinum market, says
that all the metal allocated to the Bank had been disposed of by the end of
the first quarter this year and the Russians were now back in control of
their platinum exports.
The Russians recognise the damage they did in the market - last year the
extra supply helped drive the platinum price down from a peak of Dollars 424
an ounce to a low of Dollars 330 and the average London fixing price fell
from Dollars 472 in 1990 to Dollars 376. The Almaz organisation, now
controlled by the Russian Federation, has regained its monopoly of export
sales, Mr Coombes suggests.
He predicts that Russia's export sales this year will consequently fall back
to 1990 levels and be between 600,000 and 700,000 ounces.
The extra Russian metal helped to increase the surplus of platinum supply in
western markets to 120,000 ounces last year, according to the annual review,
up from a surplus of 30,000 ounces in 1990.
Both supply, at 4.16m ounces (up from 3.73m), and demand, 4.04m ounces (up
from 3.7m), reached record levels last year. Mr Keith Green, JM's operations
director, describes platinum demand as being 'incredibly recession-proof'
and facing good growth for the next five years.
Worries about the lack of economic growth in Japan, the biggest consumer of
platinum jewellery, had been dispelled in the first quarter when sales there
topped last year's record level.
Platinum demand in 1992, increasingly driven by its use in car
anti-pollution catalysts, should be even better than last year and absorb
surplus supplies, said Mr Green. This should enable the price to climb back
to Dollars 400 an ounce by the year-end.
