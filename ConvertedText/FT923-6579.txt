FT  24 AUG 92 / World News in Brief: Crumpet revival


Britons have eaten a record 860m crumpets in the past 12 months, market
researchers Taylor Nelson say. The industry is now worth Pounds 37m a year,
an increase of 130 per cent on 1986, partly due to the introduction last
year of the finger-shaped crumpet, the first non-circular crumpet since the
Middle Ages.
