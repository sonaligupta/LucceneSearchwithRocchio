FT  15 JUN 93 / Long wait for German SEC


   By DAVID WALLER


   FRANKFURT


THE long-awaited federal regulatory body for the German securities industry
is unlikely to be fully operational before 1995 or even 1996, the government
minister responsible for policing Germany's largest stock market warned
yesterday.
Mr Ernst Welteke, economics minister for the state of Hesse, said in
Frankfurt yesterday he expected legislation to create the German equivalent
of the US Securities and Exchange Commission and to make insider dealing
illegal would be on the statute book in the first quarter of next year.
But, he cautioned, it could take up to two years after that for the new body
to recruit its full complement of up to 100 staff and be in a position to
undertake its tasks, including monitoring of insider dealing.
Mr Welteke's observations highlight the slow pace of change in the
regulatory environment in Germany - a slowness all the more marked because
of German financiers' growing recognition that it is in the interests of
Finanzplatz Deutschland, the promotion of Germany as a financial centre, to
bring regulations up to international standards as quickly as possible.
This feeling intensified in recent weeks following the downfall of Mr Franz
Steinkuhler, former head of IG Metall, the powerful engineering union. He
was forced to resign after it emerged he had dealt in shares of a
Daimler-Benz holding company ahead of a price sensitive announcement while
serving on the Daimler-Benz supervisory board.
Mr Steinkuhler's dealings in the shares of Mercedes Holding are being
investigated by the insider dealing unit of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. He
has denied insider dealing but his case has brought attention to the lack of
insider laws in Germany.
Mr Welteke called yesterday's briefing to explain measures which the state
of Hesse has taken to strengthen its regulatory activities ahead of the
introduction of the new laws.
