FT  28 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Pakistan sets its sights high


   By FARHAN BOKHARI

Pakistan is next month expected to seek investments of up to Dollars 5bn for
new transmission lines and oil storage facilities following this week's
success in attracting investment in the country's energy sector. Despite the
aggressive push, it is not entirely clear if the financing required for
these proposed projects can be put together. Sponsors of new projects would
be required to accept an 80:20 or 70:30 debt-equity ratio. Some investors
hope that the Pakistani government will expedite its first Dollars 200m
sovereign bond offer, on hold since the summer due to recent turbulence on
international bond markets.
