FT  12 MAR 92 / International Company News: Citicorp may sell credit card
process unit


   By ALAN FRIEDMAN


   NEW YORK


CITICORP, the leading US bank that is seeking to dispose of assets in order
to help strengthen its capital base, is considering the sale of its credit
card processing business.
The bank declined to comment on market rumours that a sale is being
negotiated that could raise at least Dollars 150m, but it is understood that
the division - Citicorp Establishment Services - is among the assets likely
to be sold.
The card processing unit, which employs 350 people, handles receipts and
payments among retailers and other merchants who accept credit cards.
Citicorp's deliberations on the value of the division may be influenced by
the forthcoming sale by American Express of up to 45 per cent of First Data
Corporation (FDC), a subsidiary that includes the largest third-party
processor of credit cards in the US and Britain.
American Express is expected to seek Dollars 900m to Dollars 1bn for the 45
per cent equity stake in FDC.
In a separate development, Chase Manhattan is meanwhile considering the sale
of a stake in its mortgage servicing subsidiary as part of its own programme
of asset disposals.
