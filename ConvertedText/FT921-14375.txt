FT  16 JAN 92 / Carsberg to take over at OFT


   By ROBERT RICE and HUGO DIXON


SIR Bryan Carsberg, director-general of telecommunications, is to succeed
Sir Gordon Borrie as director-general of fair trading. Sir Gordon, who will
be 60 in March, will step down at the end of June after 16 years in the job.
Sir Gordon, only the second person to hold the office since the Office of
Fair Trading (OFT) was set up under the 1973 Fair Trading Act, let it be
known last year that after completing three five-year terms he had no desire
to continue.
He was persuaded by the government to carry on for an extra year to give it
time to find a suitable replacement.
The Department of Trade and Industry yesterday described as 'pure
speculation' the suggestion that Sir Bryan's appointment was a precursor to
uniting the roles of the utilities' regulators and the OFT. Abolition of the
office of director-general of telecommunications would require primary
legislation, an official said.
Sir Bryan, 53, promised a 'pro-active' approach to his new job. He said the
OFT's functions were to 'improve the performance of the economy by making
things more competitive and more efficient' and to protect consumers. He did
not expect a radical change of policy. 'I have always been impressed by the
extent to which we use the same language,' he said. It was important that
the director-general was independent of political pressures, and he foresaw
no problems if Labour formed the next government.
The government hopes to appoint Sir Bryan's successor in time for the new
director-general of telecommunications to take over at the end of June.
