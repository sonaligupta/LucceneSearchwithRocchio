Safra Republic, the Geneva-based international private banking group
controlled by Mr Edmond Safra, said its consolidated net income jumped 28
per cent in the third quarter to Dollars 38.5m, or Dollars 2.17 a share,
mainly because of a sharp fall in loan-loss provisions.
For the nine months to September 30, net income rose 41 per cent to Dollars
119.8m.
Safra said its net interest income in the quarter was flat at Dollars 55.8m
and trading revenues tumbled 38 per cent to Dollars 5.1m. Net commission
income was down 6.1 per cent to Dollars 15.4m.
Radex-Heraklith Industriebeteiligungs, the Austrian refractories and
building materials group, returned to profit in the first half following a
large restructuring.
The group reported consolidated first half net income of Sch22.7m (Dollars
2.1m) compared with a loss Sch48.2m in the same period of last year. Group
sales advanced 13.9 per cent to Sch4.37bn.
Mr Helmut Longin, chief executive, said the group anticipated a 'modest
profit' in the full year and intended to maintain its 10 per cent dividend.
Losses at Steyr-Daimler-Puch, the troubled Austrian motor group, worsened in
the first half. The group, 71.2 per cent owned by Creditanstalt-Bankverein,
recorded a Sch200m loss compared with a Sch161m loss in the same period last
year.
