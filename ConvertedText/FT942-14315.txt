FT  21 APR 94 / World Trade News: North Americans fall out over wheat - A
dispute over Canadian grain imports to US


   By NANCY DUNNE and BERNARD SIMON


Just a week after negotiators from 125 nations gathered in Marrakesh to
celebrate trade liberalisation, the US is preparing to erect new barriers to
one of the most valuable exports of its biggest trading partner.
The administration of President Bill Clinton has pledged to raise tariffs on
fast-rising imports of Canadian grain, unless a solution is found by
tomorrow to a long-running dispute between the two countries.
The contrast between the mood in Marrakesh and US-Canada trade relations is
especially stark in the area of dispute settlement. Even as the
administration was hailing the new multilateral mechanism to defuse trade
rows, its actions suggest frustration at the bilateral system set up under
the 1989 US-Canada free trade agreement.
The US has been the loser in most of the high-profile cases referred to
bi-national panels over the past five years. These include four decisions on
alleged Canadian subsidies on softwood lumber, and two 'extraordinary
challenges' to Canadian exports of pork and live pigs.
In February 1993 a dispute settlement panel, headed by Mr Griffin Bell,
former US attorney general, rejected the US claim that Canada's durum wheat
exports were violating the free trade agreement. Still, it recommended that
the US and Canada jointly funded an audit of Canadian durum sales.
This was done between January 1 1989 and July 31 1992 and it was concluded
that the Canadian Wheat Board had been in compliance with the FTA in 102 of
105 sales.
The weight of public evidence to the contrary has not discouraged a group of
US prairie senators from pressing for firm action against Canadian wheat. In
a letter to the White House last week, six senators - including Mr Max
Baucus, head of the trade subcommittee - railed against the 'array of unfair
Canadian trading practices' and the 'monopolistic' Wheat Board.
They called on the administration to invoke Section 22 of the US Agriculture
Adjustment Act, which allows the imposition of quotas or tariffs against any
farm product that 'materially affects' domestic price support programmes.
The case for this contention rests heavily on a confidential US Department
of Agriculture report which last year charged that cheap imports from Canada
had cost the US farm programme Dollars 600m and interfered with the
operation of the wheat market. The department has so far declined to release
the study.
It is not in dispute that US imports of Canadian durum, used mainly for
pasta, have risen steadily from 11m bushels in 1988-89, when a drought
created a domestic shortage, to an estimated 30m bushels for 1993-94. At the
same time, US production has fallen from 93m bushels in 1987-88 to a
projected 69m this year.
Analysts disagree on the cause of the production decline. Some say US
farmers find it more profitable to plant spring wheat, which yields much
more grain per acre than durum. Others say US farmers have been discouraged
from planting durum because the Canadian imports have knocked down the
price. Whatever the cause, half the US durum produced in the last seven
years has been exported with the help of generous export subsidies.
Other studies have also found little basis for Washington's complaints. The
US International Trade Commission, in a 1990 study, found no consistent
difference between US and Canadian prices. Still another study, published
last Monday by a number of food industry groups, said Canadian imports at
most pushed down US wheat prices by a few cents per bushel.
Mr Martin Abel, the agri-business consultant whose firm prepared the report,
added that 'the US and Canada compete in both domestic and world markets.
When imports into the US are not sold in the world market, they make more
room for US growers in the global marketplace.'
The Canadians contend that cut-price US exports are partly to blame for the
present impasse. Wheat sold under the US Export Enhancement Programme has
squeezed Canadian supplies out of many overseas markets, forcing the
Canadian Wheat Board to look south for new outlets.
They say they are only responding to demand from US millers and food
processors for high-quality, reasonably-priced raw materials.
So strong is the demand that this year's average price is projected to be
Dollars 4.35 a bushel, well above the US support price, which means the US
agriculture department will not be obliged to pay production subsidies.
When the administration indicated that it was considering action under
Article 28 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which would
require an offer of compensation to Canada, the prairie senators became
alarmed. 'We believe that this apparent switch in emphasis from Section 22
to Article 28 locks us into supporting a trade restraint,' they said, 'when
our real goal is to promote truly free trade.'
Mr Roy Maclaren, Canada's trade minister, told parliament on Tuesday that
the two sides were still far apart.
