FT  12 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: RTZ


Despite its latest venture in US coal, RTZ remains a hostage to the metals
cycle. With aluminium and copper prices down last year, maintaining earnings
per share must be considered a creditable performance. But costs and
productivity can only be squeezed so far.
The stronger dollar should help profits on translation this year, but a
recovery in prices looks some way off. European and Japanese economies are
sliding into recession, so RTZ may have to wait some way into 1994.
Capital expenditure running at around Pounds 250m, a high tax charge and a
Pounds 195m dividend leaves little surplus cash for debt reduction in the
meantime. One can only hope the peripheral oil and gas reserves acquired
with Nerco prove easy to sell. Gearing of 63 per cent is not yet excessive.
But until it is reduced, RTZ has limited room for manoeuvre.
