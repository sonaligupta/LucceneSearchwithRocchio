FT  16 JAN 92 / The Lloyd's Report - News and Reaction: Council balks at
regulatory changes


   By RICHARD LAPPER


THE COUNCIL of Lloyd's, the insurance market's governing body, will not put
task force recommendations about the way the market is regulated into
effect, Mr David Coleridge, the chairman of Lloyd's, said yesterday.
Mr Coleridge said that to alter the existing framework of regulation 'would
delay the implementation of the recommendations'.
The decision has already drawn a protest from the Association of Lloyd's
Members, the main organisation representing Lloyd's Names, which has urged
the council to review its initial reaction.
The task force says that the future success of Lloyd's will depend
increasingly on the collective reputation of the marketplace. It says:
'Increasingly, the outside world sees Lloyd's as one business organisation.'
Some business activities - such as claims handling, technology and marketing
 -can best be handled centrally, the report says, in order to achieve
economies of scale. Yet the council's need to focus on business activities
can conflict with its regulatory role.
The report says: 'While public opinion requires that some of those
responsible for regulatory policy have a degree of independence and distance
from the market . . . independence and distance are not helpful in
developing and supporting Lloyd's collective business performance.'
The task force therefore proposes that a new Lloyd's Market Board should be
set up to look after business issues. Such a board should lead the market,
promote a central business strategy and co-ordinate the provision of
centralised services. Its members would be elected by the market's
businesses and be supported by a full-time chief executive.
A regulatory council composed of nominated external members, elected
external members and working members would be responsible for regulatory
matters.
