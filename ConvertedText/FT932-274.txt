FT  29 JUN 93 / FT Exporter (20): Short cut to an uncertain deal -
Forfaiters believe their services could soon be in great demand by companies
in the new export markets of the east / No-cash Trading


   By JON MARKS


A Romanian company needs to import cotton but can't pay for it. A Turkish
company can supply the cotton, but is unwilling to extend credit or get
involved in countertrade.
The solution: the buyer and seller turn to a specialist bank known as a
forfaiter which pays the Turkish exporter and takes the invoices at a
discount to face value.
The bank seeks payment from the exporter - or if necessary the guarantor,
the Romanian Bank for Foreign Trade - when it falls due in 180 days.
There could be no better example of a 'pure a forfait' deal than this one
arranged by the specialist forfaiter, Indosuez Aval.
The deal was completed without the exporter having to repay any of the
funding to the forfaiter, because it is known as a 'without recourse' deal -
a distinctive characteristic of forfaiting.
Other traditional characteristics include trading partners in the former
eastern block; multi-million dollar deals involving medium-term funding and
capital goods purchases.
Forfaiting can be an expensive route and takes time to arrange, but it can
be valuable in enabling trade to occur when other means of ensuring payment
and smooth cash flow are uncertain, and in those deals that may not be
possible by any other means.
It evolved in the post-war years to finance east-west trade and remains a
non-recourse instrument which might be used for sales in high-risk
situations.
Some banks and a tiny handful of specialists provide the services, details
of which are available through the main clearing banks - if the buyer is an
east European company, it is likely it will already be familiar with
specialists like Indosuez and the London Forfaiting Company.
Romania is no easy market, with the export credit agency (ECA) giving
limited cover and few banks keen to add to their country risk.
Deals can be transacted through 90 or 180-day letters of credit (l/c), but
confirmation can be problematic.
Pure a forfait deals typically finance goods worth several million dollars
in markets where the exporter might otherwise feel exposed to unacceptable
risk.
It can also help exporters make a move into new markets - a South African
telecommunications supplier recently forfaited equipment sales to Hungary.
This deal was arranged by South Africa's Finansbank with London forfaiters
participating.
Indosuez Aval, the London-based forfaiting arm of Banque Indosuez, is now
working on another Romanian transaction, to finance the sale of crude oil
worth Dollars 15m (Pounds 10m) out of Europe on 90-day terms, again taking
paper guaranteed by BFT. But Romania is a niche market. Few forfaiters still
have an appetite for Romanian paper - and then for only one to two years.
Markets with extensive debt problems, such as Russia, Bulgaria and Iran,
have left the forfaiting industry with a much reduced capacity to take on
new risk in the 1990s. 'The Soviet Union, the biggest a forfait market in
eastern Europe, is dead And it took a few people with it,' says one analyst.
Caution is the watchword. Debt-ridden markets are now largely avoided by
forfaiters and many retail banks have pulled back from the market they
entered in the 1980s: some are holding substantial amounts of non-performing
trade paper. Bankers suggest the industry is again consolidating around
specialist players in Vienna, Geneva, Prague and London for East European
operations.
Much now depends on which local bank will provide guarantees on the paper to
be discounted.
In Russia, some forfaiters would still handle transactions guaranteed by
Foreign Trade Bank (Roshvneshtorgbank) of Russia, if it became available.
But several say they would only consider Russian transactions involving new
local/western consortium banks, notably International Moscow Bank, which has
French, Finnish, Italian and Austrian shareholders.
Forfaiting business, developed to finance trade with the communist block,
which by definition meant financing state entities, has not been stimulated
in the transition to a market economy.
'With ECA conditions and interest rates as they are, this should be a boom
period for forfaiting, but we are not really seeing it,' observes Charles
Bailey, trade finance manager at the London branch of Union Bank of Finland.
Among the reasons for this are reduced spending by state entities, now
starved of hard currency and access to credit, and the tendency for a
growing number of east-west joint ventures to use other forms of financing.
During the transition period, the nascent eastern private sector is
hard-pressed to envisage the sort of Dollars 1-Dollars 2m capital equipment
purchases that were the mainstay of international forfaiting.
Eastern Europe is also in recession, limiting public sector spending.
Bankers are concerned that many of the new commercial banks emerging across
the region do not yet have the ability to make the sort of credit
assessment, or the capital backing, successfully to guarantee the paper that
forfaiters might purchase.
According to a Vienna-based forfaiter, 'deals can take months to arrange, or
break down, because of lack of the right documentation'.
The London-based Hungarian International Bank reports that in Hungary, where
forfaiting is not traditionally used as a trade instrument, the technique is
now increasingly being used.
But the consensus among bankers is that most Hungarian companies will
continue to turn to other, sometimes cheaper forms of finance.
Czech companies usually work on l/c or direct loan terms, but a forfait
techniques are becoming more common. The Czech Republic has 'relatively high
levels of capacity in the market for proper trade transactions,' according
to Andrew Freeman of Indosuez Aval.
Poland is also seeing growing forfaiter interest.
In 1992, Indosuez Aval and Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka established O B
Aval, a forfaiting joint venture, in Prague. Austrian banks, including AWT,
are also playing a leading role and the London Forfaiting Company (LFC)
opened a Prague representative office in January.
Much of this business involves Czech exports, rather than traditional import
business, reflecting a significant change in the market.
The Republic, with an industrial base manufacturing saleable machinery and
plant, has taken a lead. LFC has financed Czech machinery sales to Thailand,
Bangladesh and Pakistan.
Indosuez Aval arranged the Dollars 7.5m export of a Czech water treatment
plant to Egypt, discounting an 18-month l/c, avalised by National Bank of
Egypt.
Forfaiters believe their services could soon be in great demand by companies
in the emerging export markets of the east, as they originally were in the
import finance operations, leading to the development of forfaiting as a
means of non-recourse trade finance.
