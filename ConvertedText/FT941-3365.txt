FT  16 MAR 94 / International Company News: CTC shares suspended after move
on tariffs


   By DAVID PILLING


   SANTIAGO


Shares in CTC, the Chilean telecommunications group, were suspended in New
York and Santiago yesterday after Chilean regulatory authorities recommended
sharp cuts in fixed-rate telephone tariffs.
In New York, where CTC trades a quarter of its stock via American Depository
Receipts (ADRs), it fell 15.75 to 100.5, while in Santiago shares were down
8.32 per cent to 2,700 pesos.
Trading in Santiago was suspended for two days and halted in New York
pending news from the company.
CTC said it had lodged a complaint with the General Comptroller and would
seek to have the five-year tariff cuts declared illegal. Mr Claudio Garcia,
chief financial officer of CTC, said: 'We feel that we have a good chance to
correct the decree and that the government will correct some of these basic
errors.'
Tariff proposals submitted by the ministry of transport and
telecommunications would have a 'negative impact on its 1994-1998 business
plan', he said.
Potential loss of income to CTC from the proposed tariff structure is
calculated at Dollars 50m by Salomon Brothers, which downgraded the stock
from a buy to a hold. Salomon analyst Mr Alfredo Viegas said: 'CTC had been
expecting a slight increase; instead the government decreed sharp 30-40 per
cent decreases.'
Mr Viegas expected the impact on CTC's 1994 results to be 'large and
negative', predicting flat profits of around Dollars 240m instead of the
hoped-for 18 per cent growth.
