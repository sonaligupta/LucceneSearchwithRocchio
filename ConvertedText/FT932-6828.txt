FT  26 MAY 93 / Work starts on Bangkok link


   By WILLIAM BARNES


   BANGKOK


Work started yesterday on a Bt80bn (Dollars 3.2bn) scheme to build a 60km
elevated rail and road network through the heart of traffic-clogged Bangkok,
writes William Barnes in Bangkok.
Bureaucratic and political wrangles have delayed the project, first signed
in November 1991 and talked of for at least three decades.
The railway, capable of carrying 3m people a day, is scheduled for
completion in 1999 after which it will be operated by a private company,
Hopewell Holdings of Hong Kong, for 30 years before it is handed over to the
government.
