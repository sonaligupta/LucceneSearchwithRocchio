FT  15 JUN 93 / Lonrho legal move refused


A MOVE by Lonrho to cross-examine the three Fayed brothers over the source
of the funding for the Pounds 583m takeover of the Harrods stores group in
1985 was refused yesterday by the Court of Appeal.
Three judges allowed an appeal by the Fayeds, owners of the House of Fraser
group.
Lonrho still has pending an action against the Fayeds claiming damages for
alleged conspiracy and wrongful interference with Lonrho over the Harrods
takeover.
Lonrho claims the Fayeds lied by pretending they were wealthy and successful
businessmen from an established Egyptian family and had enough free wealth
to fund the takeover themselves.
It claims that if the truth were known - that the Fayeds were from 'very
humble origins' and that the funds for the takeover came from another
source, possibly the Sultan of Brunei - their bid would have been blocked,
leaving Lonrho free to make its own offer for Harrods.
