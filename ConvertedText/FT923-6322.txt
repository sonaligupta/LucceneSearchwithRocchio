FT  25 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Aerospace Engineering pushed into the red


AEROSPACE Engineering incurred a pre-tax loss in the year to April 30 as
exceptional rationalisation and redundancy costs of Pounds 981,000 partially
offset reduced administration expenses and interest charges.
The Wiltshire-based company's continuing activities  - it is now
concentrating on the electronics and aerospace sectors  - incurred a loss of
Pounds 64,000 against a pre-tax profit of Pounds 2.24m last time.
Discontinued activities produced a reduced deficit of Pounds 166,000.
Losses per share were 0.39p (earnings of 4.38p). A final dividend of 0.5p
(1.56p) is recommended, making a total of 1p (3.12p).
The figures were in line with warnings that the second half was unlikely to
show any improvement on the loss-making first six months, and the share
price doubled to 10p yesterday.
'We are still experiencing recession in most of our markets and cannot
predict the timing of any economic recovery,' said Mr John Davis, chairman.
'It seems unlikely that there will be any overall improvement in the
economic environment in 1992.'
The loss-making John Curran business has been sold, leading to a reduction
in borrowings of Pounds 585,000. Group borrowings overall have been cut by
Pounds 1.9m.
Following the failure of attempts to find buyers for the VFP Fluid Power,
VNE (Nuclear) and Ray Technologies companies, and the better performance
turned in by these subsidiaries in the second half, they will now be
amalgamated into one operating company on a single site.
Extraordinary costs of Pounds 1.28m related to the sale and closure of
business activities.
