FT  17 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Equities decline despite good
news on economy


   By PATRICK HARVERSON


   NEW YORK


Wall Street
PROFIT-TAKING and switching between sectors was the order of the day on US
stock markets yesterday, as share prices fell in frantic trading in spite of
good news on inflation and employment, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 8.95 at 3,249.55, but
30 points above its session lows. The more broadly based Standard & Poor's
dropped 2.56 to 418.21, while the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter
stocks fell 3.48 to 627.34. Turnover on the New York Stock Exchange was
exceptionally heavy at 334m shares, the busiest day since October 16 1989.
The day's economic news should have spelled further gains for the market.
The Labor Department reported a rise of just 0.3 per cent in consumer prices
during December, further proof that inflation is not a threat to the
economy, and announced that 49,000 less people claimed state unemployment
insurance during the first week of the year.
The economic data, however, failed to lift prices, primarily because
investors were intent yesterday either on realising some of the profits they
have earned in the recent rally, or in shifting funds within the market,
leaving some big sectors, notably drugs, sharply weaker.
Among the drug companies to take a hit for the second day running were
Merck, down Dollars 5 at Dollars 151 1/8 , Upjohn, Dollars 1 3/8 lower at
Dollars 43 3/4 , Pfizer, down Dollars 3 at Dollars 76 3/8 , Schering-Plough,
Dollars 3 1/8 lower at Dollars 61 5/8 , and the ADRs of Glaxo, Dollars 1 7/8
weaker at Dollars 30 7/8 .
Some of the money removed from drug stocks shifted into cyclicals, lifting
Caterpillar Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 47 3/8 , USX Steel Dollars 2 5/8 to
Dollars 29 3/8 , Bethlehem Steel Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 17 1/4 , and
Aluminum Company of America Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 68 1/4 . Paper stocks
were also in favour, with Chesapeake Corp up Dollars 3 at Dollars 27 7/8 ,
aided by brokers' recommendations, and International Paper up Dollars  1/2
at Dollars 72 3/4 .
On the over-the-counter market, Intel jumped Dollars 5 to Dollars 61 after
recording fourth-quarter income of 90 cents a share, up from the 80 cents a
share earned a year earlier and above analysts' forecasts.
AST Research was also higher on good earnings news, climbing Dollars 3 3/8
to Dollars 23 1/4 in heavy trading after reporting fiscal second-quarter
profits of 52 cents a share, slightly higher than market estimates.
Microsoft was down Dollars 3 3/4 at Dollars 127 3/4 , Sun Microsystems
Dollars  3/4 weaker at Dollars 33, and Amgen, down Dollars 4 3/4 at Dollars
68 5/8 .
Canada
TORONTO stocks closed higher in busy trading, led by a surge in gold stocks.
According to preliminary data, the composite index gained 9.24 points, or
0.25 per cent, to close at 3,665.96. Advancing issues outnumbered declines
366 to 283. Volume was 39.98m shares, down from yesterday's 41.108m, but
trading value climbed to CDollars 487.3m from CDollars 471.3m.
Yesterday's gain, though not nearly as strong as the previous two days,
extended the market's winning streak to seven straight sessions.
The gold group had the day's biggest gain, up 4.9 per cent as the New York
gold price gained USDollars 2.25 to Dollars US356.50. American Barrick
jumped 1 1/2 to 33 3/8 and Placer Dome was up  3/4 to 12 1/8.
