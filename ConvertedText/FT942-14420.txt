FT  20 APR 94 / International Company News: Cost-cutting helps boost Union
Carbide


   By MARTIN DICKSON


   NEW YORK


Union Carbide, the US chemicals group, yesterday reported a 52 per cent
increase in first-quarter net income, which it attributed mainly to cost
reduction and improved results from joint ventures.
The company made Dollars 61m before accounting changes, or 37 cents a share,
compared with Dollars 40m, or 28 cents a share, in the same period last
year. The figures for 1994 included non-recurring items which cut earnings
per share by 5 cents.
Sales totalled Dollars 1.13bn, compared to Dollars 1.19bn a year ago. The
company said improved volumes were largely offset by slight margin declines
in commodity products compared to the first and fourth quarter of last year.
