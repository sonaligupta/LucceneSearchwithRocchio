FT  05 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Bank hit by profits warning


   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE


A PROFITS warning from Royal Bank of Scotland prompted the shares to fall
steeply on exceptionally heavy turnover. The slide was given further impetus
by the announcement of a law suit against the bank and savage profits
forecast cuts from many banking analysts. The shares ended 21 down at 153p
after 19m traded.
Observers had expected Royal Bank's provision for bad debts to be below last
year's Pounds 351m and were shocked by the announcement that it would be
worse. As a result, forecasts for the year ending in September were scaled
right back, with Smith New Court, believed to be the most bearish, coming
down to Pounds 57m from Pounds 107m. Smith has been negative on the stock
since last November, and in spite of yesterday's sharp slide, refused to
consider the shares worth buying.
The law suit involves a Pounds 418m claim by Wallace Smith Trust, a small
London bank whose chairman was arrested for alleged fraud. Wallace Smith
went into liquidation last year and alleges that cash was transferred by
Royal Bank without authority to a related company's account. National
Westminster, which is being sued for Pounds 71m, lost 4 to 320p.
Builders weak
Building issues suffered as a combination of government statistics, industry
reaction and brokers' gloomy reports dragged the market down. Early trading
was dominated by a mostly sceptical response to the Abbey National housing
market rescue plan, which was viewed as a desperate attempt to alleviate a
dire situation.
The arrival of official figures showing housing starts for the three months
to the end of June down 8 per cent from the previous quarter, added to the
negative feeling. As if this were not enough, BZW and County NatWest weighed
in with further summaries of the gloomy outlook.
In a predictably weak building materials sector, Blue Circle dropped 10 to
181p, Marley 7 to 78p, RMC 11 to 479p and Redland 14 to 445p. Among
contractors, Amec fell 7 to 85p, John Mowlem 6 to 75p, Persimmon 6 to 184p
and George Wimpey 5 to 100p. Spring Ram was undone by an agency cross,
thought to be by Albert E. Sharpe, of 2.9m at 105p, which is where the
shares finished with a day's fall of 10. Turnover was a hefty 8.9m.
BP dividend fears
Concern about the forthcoming second quarter results from British Petroleum,
and specifically a fear that the oil group may cut the dividend, continued
to overhang the shares, which slipped a further 1 1/2 to 211p. Turnover was
heavy at 8.6m. Strauss Turnbull's Mr John Toalster, the long-standing
superbear of BP shares, said there was a two-way pull between gloomy UK
pundits and more optimistic analysts in the US.
He added: 'The US now holds about 16.2 per cent of BP compared with 7.1 per
cent last year, and US forecasts for the extent of a dividend cut range from
zero to 25 per cent. In the UK, the estimates are of a 40 to 50 per cent
cut.' Mr Toalster forecasts a halving of the second quarter dividend to
around 2.1p and a subsequent slide in the share price to between 160p and
180p.
TI upset
The spate of negative corporate news continues to undermine equities and,
yesterday, engineering company TI Group fell sharply after analysts decided
that the effect of the recession on year-end profits was likely to be
greater than originally anticipated.
The shares at first registered only a modest decline to 312p after the
company revealed a 7 per cent setback in interim profits to Pounds 50.2m,
slightly below market expectations. The slide started after the analysts
meeting, when most concluded that full-year forecasts were too high because
of the continuing recession in the UK, and many quickly moved to downgrade
predictions for the current and following year.
Sentiment was further weakened by worries about the trading prospects of
Dowty, the aerospace company acquired by TI nearly two months ago. There was
talk in the market that the rationalisation costs for the Dowty acquisition
were likely to reach Pounds 70m. By the close, TI had tumbled 31 to 283p as
turnover reached 4.2m.
An announcement by Reckitt & Colman that it would take an exceptional charge
of Dollars 100m (Pounds 52.3m) in its 1992 first-half results due to its
withdrawal from the US spice market was behind a fall of 10 to 580p in the
shares. However, an analyst argued that, because Reckitt concentrates on
cash flow rather than the balance sheet, the sentiment was misplaced.
Water shares extended their impressive recovery from last week's losses,
although one broker warned that it might be short-lived. North West rose 7
to 421p, Southern 8 to 392p and Yorkshire 9 to 443p. Ms Rachel Lucas at
County NatWest warned that the sector was starting to look expensive against
other utilities, in particular the regional electricity companies (Recs) and
that some switching could soon occur. A positive analysis on the Recs from
Smith New Court forecast continued strong earnings. Among others, Smith
likes Norweb, ahead 5 at 331p, and Southern, 6 stronger at 293p.
Hints from Yorkshire Chemicals that some of its markets were under pressure
sent the shares down 28 to 290p.
Publishers Pearson and Reed International stood out against a weak market as
the shares recovered from underperformance in the past quarter. Pearson
gained 10 to 337p and Reed was up 9 at 499p.
Bowater also recovered from recent underperformance and closed 12 up at
738p. Carlton Communications dipped 4 to 560p, held back by an agency cross
of 1.4m shares at 555p. WH Smith rose 8 to 396p as Kleinwort Benson moved
from a hold to a buy stance.
Press reports on the dire state of the London hotel market sent Forte down 8
to 149p, and also dragged Ladbroke back 7 to 170p.
Continued worries about the future of The European Fighter project (EFA)
unsettled British Aerospace, the UK's lead contractor on the project. The
shares lost 7 to 211p.
A firm motor components sector helped Lucas Industries put on 5 to 110p.
Broker Henderson Crosthwaite yesterday issued a note putting the company's
break-up value at 235p a share. Firm motors also helped Laird Group, up 7 at
270p.
