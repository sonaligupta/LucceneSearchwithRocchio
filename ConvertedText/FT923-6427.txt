FT  25 AUG 92 / South Korea unveils measures to help stock market


   By REUTER


   SEOUL


SOUTH KOREA yesterday unveiled long-awaited measures to boost the ailing
stock market, but analysts predicted the multi-billion-dollar rescue plan
would give plummeting prices only a short-term fillip, Reuter reports from
Seoul.
Prices soared temporarily when Rhee Yong-man, the finance minister,
announced the plan to inject more than three trillion (million million) won
(Pounds 1.97bn) into the bourse.
But the stock market index settled only a few points above the morning
opening level and closed just 12.12 up at 483.73.
'The government has taken these measures because the market has been
languishing in the doldrums for a long time and investor sentiment has
shrunk hugely,' Rhee said.
The measures include attempts to lower money market rates and provision of
tax incentives to investors.
Banks and insurance companies will be required to buy stocks worth 1.5
trillion won and 700bn won respectively over the next six months. The
government will also encourage pension funds to buy stocks worth 1.2
trillion won over the next 12 months.
The Korea Securities Stabilisation Fund, set up in May 1990 to revitalise
the market, will also be encouraged to raise 500bn won for stock-buying.
Investors have been anticipating for several weeks a government bail-out of
the bourse, now at its lowest for nearly five years.
The bourse index, which peaked at 1,077.77 in April 1989, has dropped by
about one-third of its value since the beginning of the year.
'The market is unlikely to be boosted immediately. Investors are accustomed
to shock remedies rather than a medium- or long-term cure,' a Seoul
securities analyst said.
