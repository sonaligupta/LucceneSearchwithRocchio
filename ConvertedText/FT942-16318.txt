FT  11 APR 94 / International Company News: Neste trims deficit to FM1.52bn
for year

Neste, the Finnish state-owned oil and petrochemicals group, announced a
FM1.52bn (Dollars 278m) pre-tax deficit for 1993, a 31 per cent reduction on
losses of FM2.22bn a year earlier.
Mr Jaakko Ihamuotila, group chief executive, predicted the group would be
back in profit in 1994, adding that its balance sheet would strengthen.
The company is benefiting from a recovery plan, launched last April, which
has brought asset sales, lower investments, cost-cutting, and reductions in
personnel.
The 1993 figures were hit by a sharp slump in oil prices, high interest
costs, and recession in the Finnish economy.
'No positive upswing has taken place in Neste's operating environment,' it
stated. It blamed an 'exceptionally low international oil price' for hitting
profits within its main oil businesses, adding that oil consumption had
fallen by 4.3 per cent in Finland during the year.
'Petrochemical and plastic prices remained at 1992's depressed levels and
international refining margins continued to be slim,' it stated.
Higher sales in all divisions helped lift group net sales by 9.9 per cent to
FM63.1bn. Oil sales rose 6.6 per cent to FM49.1bn and chemicals rose 19 per
cent to FM12bn.
There was an operating profit of FM540m, against a FM227m loss in 1992, but
net financial charges of FM2.06bn wiped this out at the pre-tax level.
