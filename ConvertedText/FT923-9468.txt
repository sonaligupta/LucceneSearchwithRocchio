FT  05 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Yorkshire Chemicals downturn to Pounds
5.16m


   By ROLAND RUDD


FIERCELY competitive pricing and the weakness of the US dollar was
responsible for Yorkshire Chemicals reporting a 3 per cent fall in interim
pre-tax profits.
In the six months to June 30 the dyes and specialist materials group saw
pre-tax profits fall from Pounds 5.33m to Pounds 5.16m on increased sales of
Pounds 48.4m (Pounds 44.8m).
Mr Phillip Lowe, chairman, said: 'As worldwide economic conditions
deteriorated we had to cut prices which affected profitability.'
The weakness of the US dollar in the period also affected profits because
the bulk of output is manufactured in the UK and sold in dollars.
The two divisions worst hit by the recession were Yorkshire Colours, which
reported a fall in operating profits from Pounds 4.09m to Pounds 3.57m, and
Yorkshire Americas, which saw profits fall from Pounds 488,000 to Pounds
345,000. Yorkshire Speciality Products and Yorkshire Australia both achieved
advances.
Capital investment in plant and buildings totalled Pounds 5.1m against
Pounds 2.6m previously. The interest charge rose to Pounds 563,000 (Pounds
490,000) as gearing increased from 13.9 per cent to 17.5 per cent.
The interim dividend has been increased to 2.5p (2.375p). Earnings were up
at 9.41p (9.35p).
The shares fell 28p to close at 290p.
