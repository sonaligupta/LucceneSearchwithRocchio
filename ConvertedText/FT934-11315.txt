FT  02 NOV 93 / Austrian airline strike talks fail


   By PATRICK BLUM


   VIENNA


NEGOTIATIONS failed yesterday to end a strike by pilots and cabin staff at
Austrian Airlines that has grounded the loss-making national carrier for the
past four days amid recriminations between unions representing flight and
ground personnel, writes Patrick Blum in Vienna.
Mr Christian Schmid, leader of the ground staff, denounced as senseless the
strike called after management announced plans to cut 500 jobs next year
from the 4,500-strong workforce. On Sunday, Mr Albin Schwarz, leader of the
1,200 striking flight staff, called for a new management, guarantees of the
airline's independence in any future co-operation agreement with other
airlines, and for a decisive say for unions in decisions affecting
personnel.
