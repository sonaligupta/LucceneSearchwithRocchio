FT  23 JUL 93 / Brussels acts over state subsidies


   By LIONEL BARBER


   BRUSSELS


THE European Commission yesterday acted on more than Dollars 200m (Pounds
133m) of state aid to industries in Italy and Austria.
In separate decisions, the Commission recommended the withdrawal of
favourable EC tariffs for two motor plants and a television factory in
Austria, involving General Motors, Steyr Nutzfahrzeuge, and Grundig
respectively.
It also banned payment of Dollars 120m of Italian government subsidies to
Cartiere de Garda, a paper company in northern Italy owned by Bertelsmann,
the German publishing empire.
The Commission's decisions reflect the tough line on state aid adopted by Mr
Karel van Miert, the Belgian commissioner responsible for competition
policy. In the Austrian cases, the Commission made clear that it could
soften its recommendation to the Council of Ministers if Austria responded
by offering to cut subsidies.
The Austrian decisions are controversial because they come in the middle of
negotiations on accession to the EC. The cases all involve products which
are competing with EC industries.
State aid amounting to 15 per cent (Ecu48.9m) of an Ecu324.2m (Pounds 245m)
investment in a General Motors Austria plant making cylinder heads and
gearboxes at a plant at Aspern, near Vienna.
A 15.1 per cent subsidy (Ecu24.3m) for rationalisation and extension of a
plant making heavy vehicles at Steyr, most of which would be exported to the
EC. The total investment is valued at Ecu162.9m.
State aid amounting to 10 per cent (Ecu7.25m) for an Ecu72.5m investment for
rationalising production of television sets at a Grundig plant in Vienna.
The Commission decision on the Cartiere case followed comments from the
French, German and British governments, a British paper manufacturer and an
Austrian industrial federation.
