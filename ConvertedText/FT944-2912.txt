FT  15 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Increased demand boosts Baggeridge to
Pounds 5.81m


   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE


Baggeridge Brick yesterday reported pre-tax profits nearly trebled from
Pounds 2.03m to Pounds 5.81m for the year to September 30.
The results were achieved against a background of a recovering housing
market along with an improvement in brick demand and a subsequent rise in
prices.
Baggeridge said increased demand had prompted the company to delay the
introduction of a new brick line to enable it to satisfy demand for its
existing products.
The recovery in the building materials business had also underpinned a rise
in capital expenditure, with new production capacity being installed.
Turnover increased 26 per cent to Pounds 37.7m (Pounds 29.9m) and earnings
per share trebled to 9.68p (3.33p). The final dividend is maintained at
2.375p for a same-again total of 3.125p.
The shares closed up 10p at 124p.
The company said the lack of a 'feelgood factor' in the housing market was
holding back sustained growth potential and adding to pressure on margins.
However, it remained confident of an 'overall improvement' in the brick
market in the coming year.
