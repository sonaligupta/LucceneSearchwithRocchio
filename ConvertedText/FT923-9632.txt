FT  04 AUG 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: 10,000m winner disqualified


Khalid Skah of Morocco, having finished first in the men's 10,000 metres,
was disqualified last night and the gold medal awarded to Richard Chelimo of
Kenya after another Moroccan runner, Hammou Boutayeb, who had been lapped by
the leading pair, was alleged to have aided his compatriot with advice and
tactical running over the last laps.
China earlier won its first athletics gold on another disqualification when
Chen Yueling was declared winner of the women's 10km walk. She crossed the
line after world champion Alina Ivanova of the Unified Team but the
Ukrainian was disqualified for running. The 24-year-old Chinese finished in
44 minutes 32 seconds, pipping another Unified competitor, Elena Nikolaeva,
by one second. Chen's compatriot Li Chunxiu won the bronze.
