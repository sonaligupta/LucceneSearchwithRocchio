FT  21 NOV 92 / International Company News: Relief as Dutch bank drops its
plans to bid for BBL

SHARES in Internationale Nederlanden Groep (ING), the Dutch banking and
insurance group, rose yesterday as investors registered relief at news on
Thursday night that the company had abandoned plans to bid for Belgium's
second-largest bank, Banque Bruxelles Lambert (BBL).
The takeover, which would have valued BBL at BFr63.6bn (Dollars 2.0bn), was
regarded by some Dutch analysts as expensive and liable to put pressure on
ING's profits.
However, the collapse of the bid is also a blow to ING's strategy of carving
out asecond home market in Belgium. The bid unravelled after ING lowered its
offer after examining BBL's books.
In September, ING, which already owned 11 per cent of BBL, indicated it
would be willing to pay up to BFr 3,600 a share for the outstanding shares,
provided that it was able to secure a total stake of at least 51 per cent.
It declined to say yesterday what its lower bid would have been.
ING said it and BBL had disagreed on the value of certain assets held by the
Belgian bank, but it would not say what its investigation of BBL's finances
had revealed.
The Dutch group, which intends to hold on to its BBL shares, said it would
continue to try to conclude an agreement with BBL whereby the Belgian bank
would sell insurance policies written by ING, in line with ING's strategy of
combining banking and insurance services.
