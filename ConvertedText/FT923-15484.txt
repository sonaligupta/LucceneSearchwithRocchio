FT  02 JUL 92 / UK to step up bid for EC bank


   By DAVID MARSH, European Editor


BRITAIN plans to use its six months of EC presidency to step up its campaign
to bring the European central bank to London.
Sir Brian Jenkins, the Lord Mayor of London, who is leading the City's bid,
said yesterday he would keep up the struggle in spite of the weekend call by
10 of Britain's 11 EC partners to place the bank in Bonn. 'I'm sure it's not
over. We will press on and pursue what we've been doing so far.'
Government officials said Sir Brian's message would be supported by
ministers, who will be shrugging off the vote in favour of Bonn at the
indecisive Lisbon summit.
Sir Brian's drive is being given strong backing by Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton,
governor of the Bank of England, who is sticking to his view that the
operational arm of the bank at least should be in London.
That is on the ground that the size of London's financial market would give
the European central bank the best possible connections to the world of
business and trading.
Britain's political position over the site for the bank has been severely
weakened by the UK's treaty reservations on whether it is to join the third
stage of economic and monetary union (Emu).
Sir Brian said Germany was trying to make acceptance of Frankfurt or Bonn as
the bank site a condition of Germany's willingness to take part in Emu. 'The
Germans will only opt in (to Emu) if they get the bank,' he said.
Sir Brian said the Corporation of London had spent only about a fifth of the
Pounds 1.5m fund set up to promote London as the home for the bank.
The decision on the site of the European Monetary Institute, likely to
predetermine the home of the bank, is to be made in December.
