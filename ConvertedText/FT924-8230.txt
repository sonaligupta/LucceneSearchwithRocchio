FT  12 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Southern Electric postpones results


   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor


SOUTHERN ELECTRIC has postponed the announcement of its interim results from
November 24 to December 15.
The company said yesterday that the three-week delay was intended to avoid a
clash with a scheduled appearance of its chairman, Mr Duncan Ross, on
November 25 before the Commons select committee inquiry into the coal
industry.
Southern Electric is deeply involved in the construction of gas-fired power
stations, which have been blamed for edging coal out of the market.
There is concern within the company that controversy could interfere with
the communication of its results.
'We have no intention of ducking the issues, but we want to do everything at
the appropriate time,' said Mr Jim Hart, commercial director.
