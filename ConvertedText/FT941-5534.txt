FT  05 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Fixed rates edge up


   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU


Interest rates on most fixed-rate mortgages are edging upwards, writes
Scheherazade Daneshkhu. The largest increase in the new fixed rates from
Abbey National is 0.4 of a percentage point.
The first-time buyer fixed rate of 6.99 per cent (7.3 APR) until January 31
1997 replaces a three-year, 6.69 per cent fix. The one-year, 5.25 per cent
(5.4 APR) and two-year, 6.25 per cent (6.5 APR) fixes are unchanged. Booking
fee is Pounds 90 and early redemption penalties are 30-90 days' interest.
Other customers are being offered 7.14 per cent (7.5 APR) to the end of
January 1997; 7.59 per cent (8.0 APR) until January 31 1998; and 8.6 per
cent (9.1 APR) until March 31 2003. The 6.39 per cent (6.7 APR) fix until
April 30 1996 is being continued.
Booking fee is Pounds 250 for the two shorter-term mortgages and Pounds 300
for the others. Early redemption penalties are 60-300 days' interest. The
mortgages are not tied to insurance products.
Barclays bank is offering first-time buyers 6.45 per cent (6.7 APR) fixed
until January 31 1997; the bank's life insurance policy is mandatory if the
mortgage is endowment or pension. Booking fee is Pounds 200 and the early
redemption penalty is four months' interest.
Fixed rates for other borrowers are 6.75 per cent (7.0 APR) until January 31
1997; 7.45 per cent (7.8 APR) to the end of January 1999; and 8.25 per cent
(8.7 APR) until January 31 2004. Booking fee is Pounds 300 for the 10-year
fix and Pounds 200 for the other two.
There is an additional Pounds 100 arrangement fee on all three fixes, which
is waived if you take out an endowment/pension or life insurance policy
through the bank. Early redemption penalties are between 4-7 months'
interest.
Woolwich has launched a five-year fixed rate of 7.65 per cent (8.0 APR). The
application fee is Pounds 295. The society has dropped the rate on its 7.25
per cent, three-year fix, introduced on February 25, to 7.10 per cent (7.4
APR). Application fee is Pounds 250. Insurance is not compulsory and the
mortgages are repayment, endowment, pension or Pep. Early redemption costs
3-6 months' interest.
TSB has a 10-year, 7.99 per cent fixed (8.5 APR) up to 75 per cent of the
value of the property. Arrangement fee is Pounds 295 and the mortgage is
tied to the bank's buildings and contents insurance.
Broker John Charcol's 6.99 per cent, five-year fix is available until the
end of March. For a Pounds 250 fee, costs for re-mortgage customers will be
covered, but borrowers must have a 25 per cent deposit.
