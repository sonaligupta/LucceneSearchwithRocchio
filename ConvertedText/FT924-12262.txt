FT  21 OCT 92 / International Company News: Bristol-Myers creeps ahead amid
strong overseas sales


   By ALAN FRIEDMAN


BRISTOL-MYERS Squibb, the world's third biggest pharmaceuticals company,
yesterday reported a 5 per cent rise in third quarter net earnings, to
Dollars 589m.
The modest improvement, struck on quarterly revenues 13 per cent higher at
Dollars 3.1bn, translated into earnings per share of Dollars 1.14, compared
with Dollars 1.08 a year ago.
For the first nine months of 1992 the group's net income was also 5 per cent
higher, at Dollars 1.62bn. Revenues were 7 per cent better at Dollars
8.77bn.
Mr Richard Gelb, chairman of Bristol-Myers, said international sales were
particularly strong during the quarter, recording a 24 per cent improvement
thanks to foreign exchange gains and 13 per cent without calculating the
effect of currencies. This compared with US domestic sales that rose 6 per
cent.
Mr Gelb said all four of the group's core businesses - pharmaceuticals,
consumer products, medical devices and nutritional products - had better
earnings in the quarter.
One-time restructuring charges caused Eli Lilly, the Indiana-based
pharmaceuticals group, to suffer a Dollars 268.5m third quarter loss. In the
third quarter of 1991 the company had a Dollars 297.5m net profit. Sales in
the quarter were 10 per cent higher at Dollars 1.48bn. Restructuring and
other special charges amounted to Dollars 519.6m.
Warner-Lambert, the New Jersey-based health care and consumer products
company, said its third quarter net earnings rose 14 per cent to Dollars
165m on record quarterly sales of Dollars 1.44bn, which were 10 per cent
better without accounting for currency fluctuations.
