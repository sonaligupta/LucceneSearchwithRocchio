FT  29 APR 94 / Observer: Confederation of dunces


Who should carry the can for the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia?
For historians of the esoteric, Karol Wojtyla - also known as John Paul II -
is high on the list of suspects.
His culpability was scrutinised in London yesterday at the Royal Institute
for International Affairs. The case for the prosecution is that in June 1991
His Holiness allegedly egged on Catholic Croats and Slovenes to separate
themselves from Orthodox Serbs. A diplomatic campaign, partly waged through
the German press, was then conducted to secure international recognition of
their independence.
Nonsense, says Archbishop Jean-Louis Tauran, papal Secretary for Relations
with States - foreign minister for short. John Paul II 'never pressed for
the disintegration' but instead 'suggested democratic openings within the
constitutional framework'. Moreover, 'in messages to all the leaders of the
republics seeking independence . . .the Holy See considered it desirable
that a form of confederation be preserved', only changing its mind after the
federal army began attacking Croat and Slovene civilians.
Up piped Misha Gavrilovic, of the Serb Information Office. Yugoslavia 'was
and is . . .a federation'. Papal calls for a confederation mean the Pope
advocates Yugoslav dissolution. 'Federation, I meant,' replied Tauran, who
must be hoping his next posting is not Belgrade.
