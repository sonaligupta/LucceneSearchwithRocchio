FT  26 JUN 92 / Ex-coal chiefs back Scottish plan


MR Malcolm Edwards, who resigned as British Coal's commercial director this
year, is among former managers lobbying for a separate coal corporation in
Scotland after the industry's privatisation.
The Royal Bank of Scotland yesterday confirmed that Lord Younger, its
chairman, had met a group of former British Coal managers and
representatives of mining unions for 'exploratory discussions' on financing
the proposed corporation.
Mr Edwards resigned as commercial director after disagreements with Mr Neil
Clarke, corporation chairman.
The group has been lobbying ministers and other senior Conservatives for
support for a management-employee buyout to control all deep-mine and
opencast reserves in Scot-land.
The Royal Bank said yesterday: 'We are still at the stage of having
exploratory discussions.'
Chairman-designate of the proposed corporation is Mr George McAlpine, former
British Coal Scottish area director and group manager.
He said the group expected the 'environmentally friendly low-sulphur
Scottish coal' to yield annual profits of about Pounds 60m. That would
include Pounds 20m from the Longannet deep mine complex and Pounds 40m from
opencast operations, the most profitable in the UK.
The Scottish Trades Union Congress is also involved and has made a formal
submission to the government on the issue.
