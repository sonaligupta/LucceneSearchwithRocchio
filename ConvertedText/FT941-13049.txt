FT  27 JAN 94 / Observer: Food for thought


The Michelin guide to hotels and restaurants in Great Britain and Ireland,
21 years old yesterday, remains as snooty as ever, despite advancing age.
Only a couple of establishments are felt worthy of three stars, even though
the number of one stars has now topped 50 for the first time.
Sadly, the passing years have also precipitated a degree of memory lapse.
Journalists set out for the award ceremony at new one-star holder Leith's,
in Kensington Road, as per the invitation, only to find themselves lost.
Forgivable, seeing that the collators of the 5,700 entries had omitted the
all-important 'Park' nestling between the Kensington and the Road.
