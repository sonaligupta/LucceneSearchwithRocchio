FT  27 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chilean group faces big futures
losses

Codelco, the state-owned Chilean group, yesterday launched an investigation
into 'serious irregularities' in its futures trading on the London Metal
Exchange that could result in losses of about USDollars 100m.
The deputy head of sales, Mr Juan Pablo Davila, was sacked and three other
senior executives, including Mr Owen Guerrini, head of sales, resigned.
Nervous tremors went through the London and New York metals markets after
the announcement, by Mr Alejandro Noemi, president of Codelco, the world's
biggest copper producer which had estimated 1993 profits of Dollars 115m.
Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, said:
'People will not want to establish substantial positions in any direction
until Codelco's situation is made clearer.' If there was any expectation
that a major player like Codelco was to liquidate contracts to buy copper,
'others would sell very quickly, it would have a snowball effect and a big
impact on the copper market.'
But Mr Ted Arnold, metals specialist at the Merrill Lynch financial services
group, said Codelco was a big, state-owned organisation well able to meet
its obligations. 'I would be amazed if Codelco liquidated its positions, so
I don't imagine this having much of an impact on the copper market.'
Codelco's Mr Noemi said accountants Price Waterhouse would conduct an
independent investigation into the potential losses. 'We have projected a
Dollars 100m loss, but it could be more and it could be less. A final figure
will be known in about two weeks,' he said.
The scandal could have profound effects on the future of Codelco, which
accounts for about 20 per cent of Chile's export earnings.
