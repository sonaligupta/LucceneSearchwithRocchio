FT  30 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Unit trust sales reach new monthly
record - At a glance


Unit trust sales reached a new record of Pounds 1.37bn in March, more than
Pounds 200m above the previous best month, September 1987, when net sales
were Pounds 1.16bn.
Strong sales of unit trust personal equity plans were an important factor in
the record sales. Peps, which shield investments from capital gains and
income tax, accounted for about three quarters of total net sales to private
investors in the first three months of the year.
Pep sales are normally strong in the closing weeks of the tax year (which
ended on April 5). And this year sales were also spurred by fresh price
competition among companies selling unit trust Peps. Price competition is
now spreading to other unit trusts as well as those wrapped in a Pep. (See
