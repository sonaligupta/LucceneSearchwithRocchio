FT  27 SEP 94 / People: Philip Jarrold to head Vernons pools


After four years with Peaudouce, the nappy manufacturer, managing director
Philip Jarrold is to head Vernons, Ladbroke's pools division, from next
month.
Before joining Peaudouce, which is part of the Swedish SCA/Molnlycke group,
Jarrold, 44, had worked for Reed Elsevier, Kraft Foods and Mars.
Ladbroke said it thought Jarrold's experience would be vital in helping to
counter the imminent threat of the national lottery, which begins in
November. It said it particularly valued Jarrold's expertise in dealing with
retailers.
Although pools coupons are often available in tobacconists' shops, their
legal status in retailers' premises has been unclear. However, as part of
the attempt to allow other gambling products to compete with the national
lottery, pools companies are being given a formal right to distribute
coupons through retail outlets.
