FT  20 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Holmes & Marchant warns on profits


Shares in Holmes & Marchant Group fell 17p to 38p yesterday as the marketing
services company warned that pre-tax profits for the current year would be
some 40 per cent lower than in 1993.
Mr John Holmes, chairman and chief executive, said the downturn was the
result of disappointing trading levels within certain of the group's
subsidiaries coupled with reorganisation costs at two lossmaking businesses.
The group's bankers have agreed to a 12-month capital repayment holiday on
its medium term loan, with the term being similarly extended by 12 months to
December 3 1999.
