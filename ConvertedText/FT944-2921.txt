FT  15 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Eliza Tinsley ahead


Eliza Tinsley Group, the USM-traded hardware manufacturer, yesterday
reported a 24 per cent increase in interim profits despite a marginal fall
in sales.
Mr Jeremy Sharp, chairman, said the improved performance reflected
'stringent cost control' and the divestment of the lossmaking ET Hi-Tec
computer business.
The pre-tax line for the six months to September 30 amounted to Pounds
407,000 (Pounds 329,000). Turnover eased to Pounds 7.7m (Pounds 7.86m).
Earnings per share improved to 3.63p (2.84p); the interim dividend is
maintained at 1.96p.
