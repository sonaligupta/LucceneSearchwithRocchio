FT  11 APR 92 / House prices may gain from victory


   By DAVID BARCHARD


BANKS and building societies believe the Conservative election victory has
set the stage for a recovery in the housing market in the second half of the
year.
However, a pick-up may take some months to assert itself. Most mortgage
lenders believe any recovery in the second half will simply cancel out the
fall in prices in first half, leaving the market flat at the end of the
year. By next year, the picture could be different as house prices make
further gains.
Halifax Building Society, the largest mortgage lender, said: 'The end of
uncertainty is good news for the market. Confidence should now return, with
a gradual recovery in prices.'
Figures published by Halifax yesterday show that house prices were static
last month after falling 1.2 per cent in January. House prices in the
south-east are now 7.7 per cent below their level of a year ago. Halifax
forecast that prices should be on a rising trend by the year end.
Banks expect a gradual decline in base rates. But Mr Michael Shaw, chief
executive of Britannia Building Society, warned there may be increased
competition for savings, meaning that rates do not fall as quickly as they
might have otherwise done.
