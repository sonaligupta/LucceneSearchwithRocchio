FT  27 JAN 94 / International Company News: Credit National profits fall but
dividend is held

Credit National, the corporate banking group, has warned that it suffered a
sharp fall in net profits during 1993 after a 'particularly difficult year'.
The group, now headed by Mr Jean Yves Haberer, controversial former chairman
of Credit Lyonnais, said in a statement that it planned to maintain its
dividend for 1993 despite the reduction in net profits from the FFr585.9m
(Dollars 98.6m) achieved in 1992.
However, a later statement that Credit National would pay a dividend of
FFr20.00 for 1993 caused confusion on the Paris stock market. The group's
dividend in 1992 had been worth FFr20.00 but it had since split its shares
thereby doubling the number in issue.
Credit National's shares were temporarily suspended until it clarified the
situation by issuing another statement confirming that, because of the share
split, the FFr20.00 payment for 1993 was equal to that of 1992.
The group, like other French banks, was badly affected last year by the
sluggish state of demand for corporate credit as companies cut back on
investment due to recessionary pressures and concern about the high rate of
real interest rates in France.
It was also affected by the sharp increase in the number of company
failures, particularly among the small and medium-sized businesses that have
borne the brunt of the French recession.
The amount of credit extended by the group fell by 20 per cent to FFr14.4bn
during 1993 against FFr18bn in 1992.
However, Credit National, which recently finalised a cross-shareholding
agreement with IKB Deutsche Bank of Germany, fared relatively well in its
investment activities. It also benefited from an improved performance from
Dupont-Denant, its stock broking subsidiary.
