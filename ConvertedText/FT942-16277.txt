FT  11 APR 94 / Survey of Latin American Finance (14): Possibly far more
talk than action - Can Latin America finance its privatised infrastructure?
Stephen Fidler discusses the problems


   By STEPHEN FIDLER


One of the most dramatic signs of the shift towards market-orientated
economic policies in Latin America has been privatisation programmes on an
unprecedented scale.
Yet the shifting of government assets and responsibilities to the private
sector has raised a number of important questions. One of the most pressing
is how infrastructure development can be financed. This is more than a
financial question: the debt crisis of the 1980s and the consequent
budgetary stringency resulted in a deterioration of infrastructure which in
many countries represents a real obstacle to growth.
Many of those involved in project finance believe that pure
privately-financed infrastructure projects will be few and far between. Mr
John Flora, transport specialist at the World Bank, told a Canning House
conference in London last month: 'We are not going to see many pure private
sector financings. It's going to take a partnership of government, the
private sector and third party intermediaries.'
While the governments of Latin countries have in many cases moved rapidly to
privatise assets - with the backing of the World Bank and other development
institutions - these institutions have themselves moved slowly to
accommodate the changes.
The World Bank is forbidden by its statutes from lending without government
guarantee, and until now, convention has dictated that the InterAmerican
Development Bank lends only to governments.
The World Bank has a private sector arm - the International Finance
Corporation - but it is too small to handle the demand for infrastructure
finance from the region, let alone that coming from rapidly-growing
economies in Asia.
Before he stepped down last year as head of the IFC, Sir William Ryrie,
argued in a speech in London that 'in the World Bank group, the balance
between state-funding and private-sector-supporting activities needs to be
reconsidered'. Some ideas had been put forward for a transfer of resources
from the World Bank to the IFC and these needed careful thought, he said.
The subject of providing finance for infrastructure has been preoccupying
senior bankers and finance officials, but the results of their deliberations
have not yet emerged. Export credit agencies have been talking under the
auspices of the Berne Union over how project finance can be provided, and
Britain's Export Credit Guarantees Department has issued preliminary
proposals for more flexibility.
The Institute of International Finance - the Washington-based think tank
owned by international banks - has been holding talks with the World Bank,
the IADB and the US Treasury, among others, to find ways to bring banks into
project financings.
Mr Anthony Bottrill, deputy-managing director of the Institute of
International Finance, said: 'Private borrowers are going to become
increasingly important and it's important that the multilateral development
banks adapt accordingly. What we'd like to see is each creditor and investor
group playing a role that reflects its comparative advantage.
'Private lenders should be looking at commercial risk, but they are not as
well placed to go with political risk and transfer risks. The official
lenders should use their guarantee authority to guarantee against political
risk.'
This would involve the official lenders using much more fully than in the
past guarantee powers that shareholder governments have been unwilling to
see used.
Mr Bottrill said much of what the banks are seeking are contained within the
existing Expanded Cofinancing Operations programme of the World Bank. 'The
ECO programme contains within it most of the features but it hasn't been
used actively enough.' The reason for this in part has been the reluctance
of government shareholders to push the institutions into private sector
lending, in part because of concern about the effect this would have on
their credit rating.
These worries have been reflected in discussions about increasing the
capital of the IADB. The IADB will in coming years be the only official net
provider of finance to the region as, barring a new financial crisis, Latin
American countries will be repaying the World Bank in net terms.
However, European shareholders, in particular, have been anxious to keep
down the level of funding for private sector infrastructure development.
Discussions continue but, while the bar to private sector finance will be
lifted, loans to the private sector may well be limited to 5 per cent of
overall new lending, some Dollars 400m-Dollars 500m a year. Those countries
that have privatised most will receive a disproportionate amount, but even
supposing this lending will act as a catalyst for private sector financing,
the amounts will still be small compared to infrastructure demands.
Mr Alberto Paz, chief of the InterAmerican Development Bank's transportation
and communication division, said some projects have been delayed while the
discussion continues. 'We have a lot of projects that have been delayed in
the expectation that this facility will be available.'
But slow movement by official lenders is not the only reason why, in the
words of Mr David Suratgar, deputy-chairman of Morgan Grenfell
International, 'there is possibly far more talk than action'.
Banks remain inhibited from lending for a variety of reasons. Many still
harbour memories of the 1980s debt crisis and are worried by the country
risk.
Many banks no longer have a presence in Latin America to monitor their
lending. Furthermore, said one British banker, 'project finance is very
time-consuming and a lot of banks are concentrating on the Far East - that
is where the deals get done.'
The growing importance of the securities markets and institutional investors
may to some extent offset the reticence of the banks. Last year, for
example, a group of energy companies launched a fund - along with the IFC -
aimed at investment in private power generating capacity in Latin America.
The targeted size of the Scudder Latin America Trust for Independent Power
was Dollars 500m.
Mr John Richardson, associate director at Nomura International in London,
said: 'A great deal of emphasis will be placed on securitisation as a means
of financing. Demand far exceeds the available supply and we are going to
see a wider range of instruments.'
However, banks will still have an important and unavoidable role in the
financings: 'During the construction phase of the project, you are not going
to be able to use bond finance; construction finance is the realm of banks.
But once the construction is complete and it starts generating revenues,
then securitisation comes into its own. The banks will be phased out and
their balance sheets freed again.'
