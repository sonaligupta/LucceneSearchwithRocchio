FT  01 NOV 93 / Economics: UK inflation again under scrutiny


   By EMMA TUCKER


THE Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin is produced tomorrow. Its inflation
report will be of particular interest following signs from official data
that price rises are gradually gathering pace.
But the Bank, which has taken a fairly relaxed view of inflationary
pressures in the economy over the past few months, is unlikely to alter
radically its stance in tomorrow's report.
Figures for narrow money come out on the same day. Economists believe the
year-on-year rate will rise again, to stay well above the government's 0-4
per cent monitoring range and lending weight to evidence that consumers are
the driving force behind the recovery.
This is a heavy week for German statistics with industrial production and
employment figures due towards the end of the week. Provisional figures for
industrial production in August showed a larger than expected rise of 2.1
per cent on the month, following July's 0.8 per cent fall. Many economists
expect to see a downwards revision to the August figure, and the median
forecast for September is a drop of 0.5 per cent on the month.
In the US, the focus will be on non-farm payrolls at the end of the week.
They should have increased by 160,000 according to the median forecast,
following September's 156,000 rise. In the third quarter, the average rise
was 117,000 per month, but all the gains occurred in the service sector.
Higher paying manufacturing jobs were lost at a rate of 26,000 per month and
are expected to suffer further.
The following are the rest of the week's economic highlights and events. The

International, the financial information company.
