FT  05 AUG 93 / UK Company News: STC Submarine Systems in transatlantic
cable deal


   By ANDREW ADONIS


STC SUBMARINE Systems, the UK-based subsidiary of Northern Telecom which is
about to be sold to Alcatel of France, has won a Pounds 100m contract for a
new transatlantic cable system.
The contract, one of STC's largest, is the first transatlantic order for a
cable applying STC's new optical amplification technology, which provides
significantly greater capacity than existing systems.
It has been bought by a consortium comprising British Telecommunications,
France Telecom and AT&T of the US.
Called Tat-12, the system will consist of 4,000km of cable and 85 undersea
optical amplifiers for the link from Greenhill, Rhode Island, to Land's End
in the UK. It is due to be in service by 1995.
The contract underlines the earnings capacity of STC, which Northern
Telecom, the Canadian supplier, last month sold to Alcatel for Pounds 600m,
subject to the granting of EC and UK regulatory consents.
