FT  22 OCT 92 / International Company News: Downturn at Marsh & McLennan


   By NIKKI TAIT


MARSH & McLennan, the world's largest insurance broker, yesterday reported a
small decline in third-quarter profits, to Dollars 69.7m after-tax.
This compares with Dollars 74m in the same period a year ago, and translates
into earnings per share of 97 cents, down from Dollars 1.02.
Marsh, based in New York, also takes in the Putman Group investment services
business and the Mercer employment benefits operation.
Third-quarter operating profits amounted to Dollars 125.1m, against Dollars
133.4m in the same period of 1991. Revenues totalled Dollars 730m, up from
Dollars 679m.
The latest figures brought after-tax profits to Dollars 251.7m for the first
nine months of the year, little different from the Dollars 251.3m recorded
at this stage last year.
