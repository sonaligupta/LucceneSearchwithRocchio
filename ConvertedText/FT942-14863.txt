FT  19 APR 94 / Move to open rail networks


   By DAVID GARDNER

European Union transport ministers yesterday opted to do more to open up
Europe's national railway monopolies, and put in place later this year
further measures to encourage independent and cross-border rail operators.
Ministers gave an initial green light to two proposals designed to build on
the seminal 1991 decision to open up Europe's fragmented rail network to
private and transnational train services.
That gave joint ventures between companies of more than one member state
access to all EU rail networks needed to provide the service, and the right
to the entire EU network to companies operating 'combined transport' freight
services - shifting cargo through a combination of rail and road. Fifteen
months after the start-up of the single market, however, the 1991
legislative breakthrough has had no practical result. Brussels has therefore
come forward with two supplementary laws on access and charging for
companies that want to take up their right to use rail infrastructure.
The national monopolies have to account separately for infrastructure and
operating costs, in order to be able to set charges for new entrants using
state-owned networks. The EU will now work to systematise this, and to agree
on a system whereby a licence to operate granted by one member state is
valid throughout the EU.
