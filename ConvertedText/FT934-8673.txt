FT  13 NOV 93 / BAe says Taiwan joint venture has not been cancelled


   By DANIEL GREEN


BRITISH Aerospace yesterday denied a Chinese language newspaper report in
Taipei that a proposed joint venture with Taiwan Aerospace Corporation (TAC)
had been abandoned, writes Daniel Green.
The newspaper said that Mr Earle Hou, TAC's chairman, indicated that the
deal to build BAe's regional jet aircraft in Taiwan had been cancelled.
Mr Hou also said that no progress had been made recently to bridge
differences between the two sides: Taiwan wants to concentrate on a future
model of aircraft, while BAe insists that agreement to assemble the current
model be concluded first.
BAe said it expected no decision would be made until after Taiwanese
regional elections scheduled for November 27.
