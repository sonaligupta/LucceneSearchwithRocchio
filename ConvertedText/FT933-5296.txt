FT  03 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Computers spark price plunge
for gold and silver


   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent


GOLD AND silver prices plunged in late trading yesterday as the computers
programmed by some New York investment funds sent out 'sell' signals. Silver
led the way and lost nearly 10 per cent of its value in a few minutes of
hectic activity and touched Dollars 4.35 a troy ounce before closing in
London at Dollars 4.49, down 32 cents.
This provided a catalyst for the funds to start selling gold - many of them
link their computerised precious metals investment programmes. The gold
price at the London bullion market touched Dollars 361.50 an ounce at one
point before recovering to close at Dollars 364.50, down Dollars 5.25.
Only one month ago, on August 2, gold reached Dollars 406.70 an ounce, its
highest level since the outbreak of the Gulf war in January 1991. 'The froth
in the market is being blown away,' said Mr Andy Smith, analyst with the
Union Bank of Switzerland.
He pointed out that some New York investors were squaring their market
positions ahead of the long Labour Day weekend (the Labour Day holiday in
the US is on September 6).
Physical demand for gold in the Far East and the Middle East remained weak
and the market might even be over-supplied at present. The best hope for the
gold bulls was that there would be a seasonal pick-up in demand for physical
gold so that the market would be stabilised.
Mr Smith was sticking to his forecast, first made in July, that gold would
average Dollars 350 an ounce in the last three months of 1993.
Mr James Leahy, analyst at Credit Lyonnais Laing, suggested a range of
between Dollars 375 and Dollars 380 an ounce was more likely in the last
part of this year, with the price perhaps ending 1993 at about Dollars 400.
He pointed out that yesterday's sell-off took place in a seasonally very
quiet market when 'a little selling goes a long way'.
However, if gold's closing price on the New York Commodity Exchange today
was below Dollars 365, 'it would be worrying for gold bulls'. If gold was
above that level, 'all is not lost'.
