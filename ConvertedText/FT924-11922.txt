FT  23 OCT 92 / Bingham Report - Investigation into the BCCI scandal: US
investigators support criticism


   By ALAN FRIEDMAN


   NEW YORK


US OFFICIALS investigating the BCCI affair were cautious in their reactions
to the Bingham report yesterday but generally agreed with criticism of the
Bank of England, Price Waterhouse and Abu Dhabi.
Mr Jonathan Winer, an aide to Mr John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat
senator who released his own BCCI report earlier this month, said the
Bingham conclusions appeared to be 'consistent with our own report'.
Mr Winer said the underlying problem was 'that the rules governing bank
regulation and the international movement of capital need to be reviewed in
order to make sure there is not a repetition of BCCI'.
The Senate BCCI investigator pointed to a danger underscored by the Bingham
report that 'national boundaries are readily permeable'. Mr Winer said that
without greater transparency, as well as co-operation among regulators in
the leading industrialised countries, 'we will continue to be vulnerable'.
The Kerry report used harsh language to criticise the Bank, and Mr Kerry
even said that the Bank had effectively covered up the BCCI affair by not
acting in 1990 when it received initial indications of the fraud. The Bank
rejected Mr Kerry's conclusions.
Three weeks ago Mr Kerry also disclosed that Abu Dhabi, BCCI's majority
shareholder, was the target of an investigation by the office of Mr Robert
Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney.
In New York Mr John Moscow, the assistant district attorney who has
spearheaded the Morgenthau BCCI investigation, said the Bingham report
showed that electronic funds transfer technology 'may be defeating
regulators'. He said a new generation of regulators or a new philosophy
would be needed in order to tackle the problems posed by such technology.
