FT  16 JAN 92 / Government Bonds: Overseas interest drives up prices across
Europe


   By SARA WEBB and PATRICK HARVERSON


   LONDON, NEW YORK


EUROPEAN government bond markets yesterday showed strong gains, helped by
overseas buying interest, particularly in the five-year sector.
Traders reported outright buying in Germany, France, Spain, Denmark and
Sweden, with investors anticipating interest rates cuts in these bond
markets.
Activity in the German government bond market was fairly volatile, but the
Liffe bund futures contract closed higher on the day, having reached a
significant resistance level. The Liffe contract opened at 88.30, and moved
between a low of 88.17 and a high of 88.47 before closing at 88.39.
Traders said bund prices rose on news that the Bundesbank injected DM7.3bn
of liquidity into its money market operations yesterday. At its allocation
of 35-day and 63-day ments, the Bundesbank allocated more liquidity than had
been expected. Traders said this could be taken as a sign that the
Bundesbank wants to ease short-term rates.
The French market also showed strong gains, with the Matif futures contract
reaching a high of 109.12 on heavy volumes. The contract traded between a
low of 108.86 and closed at 109.08.
AFTER a mixed opening, US Treasury prices fell sharply across the board as
investors sold amid dwindling hopes of another interest rate cut and in
response to an unexpected revision in the latest purchasing managers' index.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  7/16 at 104
15/16 , yielding 7.571 per cent. The two-year note was down 5/32 at 99 7/8 ,
yielding 5.050 per cent.
After four days of consecutive declines, the long end of the market appeared
to have reversed the trend in early trading. Comments from Mr Wayne Angell,
one of the Federal Reserve governors, who said in a television interview he
would not be against trimming the size of 30-year bond issues if it was
economically necessary, boosted sentiment at the opening.
Prices turned down, however, after the National Association of Purchasing
Management revised its December index from an originally estimated 46.5 per
cent to a marginally more bullish 47.4 per cent. Market sentiment was also
affected by a Market News Service report claiming Fed officials were
increasingly optimistic about the economic outlook, and that the chances of
further monetary easing were dwindling.
UK GOVERNMENT bond prices gained up to half a point. They were helped by
sterling stability in the foreign exchange market and the strong lead from
other European bond markets.
The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 rose from 115 1/16 to 115
19/32 , to yield 9.44 per cent by late afternoon. In the futures market, the
Liffe gilt contract rose from 97.04 to reach a high of 97.15 before falling
back to 97.11 on a volume of over 35,000 contracts.
Traders said market sentiment was also helped by an opinion poll released
yesterday which showed the Conservative party one point ahead of the
opposition Labour party.
THE strengthening of the dollar against the yen pushed Japanese government
bond prices lower in London trading.
The yield on the benchmark No 129 JGB moved from its opening of 5.365 per
cent to 5.4 per cent as the yen weakened from 126.50 to the dollar to
128.70. The Tokyo market was closed for a public holiday.
