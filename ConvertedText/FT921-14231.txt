FT  17 JAN 92 / Brussels gives ground over waste plans


   By REUTER


   BRUSSELS


THE European Commission has dropped key provisions of a plan to reduce the
amount of discarded packaging dumped on Community rubbish tips following
intense pressure from industry and trade, Reuter reports from Brussels.
It latest draft proposals, as yet unofficial and subject to change, aim to
bring into line differing national schemes for combating mountains of
discarded packaging, from wooden crates to toothpaste tubes.
But industry officials expressed disappointment yesterday that the proposals
were unlikely to force Germany to ease important parts of its controversial
packaging recycling law. This has imposed tough obligations on industry and
trade to take back and recycle used packaging.
There have been several formal complaints to Brussels alleging it breaches
the EC's free trade rules.
The paper abandons the idea, which industry had hated, of freezing
per-capita output of packaging waste at 1990 levels.
Governments and industry would have to ensure that within 10 years at least
90 per cent of all used packaging was 'recovered' - reused, recycled into
new products, burned to produce energy or turned into compost. At least 60
per cent would have to be reused or recycled within the same time.
Earlier plans for achieving a 60 per cent recovery rate and 40 per cent
recycling within five years no longer figure in the text, giving member
states greater flexibility.
Also gone are controversial proposals for an EC-wide charge on packaging to
fund national waste management schemes. Member states are left instead to
decide on such measures themselves.
