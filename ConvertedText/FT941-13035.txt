FT  27 JAN 94 / WH Smith cautious on consumer spending


   By NEIL BUCKLEY


WH Smith, the retail and distribution group, yesterday announced an 11.2 per
cent increase in interim pre-tax profits, but said it was still cautious
about consumer spending.
Profits for the six months to November 27 increased from Pounds 40.2m to
Pounds 44.7m - towards the lower end of market expectations - and the shares
closed down 6 1/2 p at 530 1/2 p.
Sir Malcolm Field, group managing director, said sales in the five weeks to
December 31 increased 6.2 per cent on the year before, improving to 7 per
cent in the first three weeks of this month.
'We are cautious about consumer expenditure in 1994, but we will continue
down the same path of finding more efficient ways of doing things,' Sir
Malcolm said.
He said efficiency improvements had helped the company to offer lower prices
without sacrificing gross margin. He added that successful retailing in the
1990s meant not just offering the lowest prices, but good service, and he
was scathing about some rivals' claims that they had cut prices to drive
volumes.
'Some retailers are good at claiming they have the lowest prices, but when
you actually look at them it's not true at all.'
Group turnover increased 6.6 per cent to Pounds 1.14bn. UK retail sales,
including WH Smith, Our Price, Waterstones, and a 50 per cent share of the
Virgin chain, rose 7 per cent to Pounds 612.5m, with profits up 4.6 per cent
to Pounds 32.1m.
WH Smith said music sales had recovered, and a price promotion on videos had
lifted sales, but sales of computer game hardware were down.
Its share of losses at Do It All, the DIY joint venture with Boots, fell
slightly to Pounds 8.3m (Pounds 8.4m). Sir Malcolm said the group was
negotiating to sell a number of the chain's weaker stores and a provision
would be made at the year-end.
The distribution and office supplies business lifted sales 4.2 per cent to
Pounds 497.6m and profits 14.2 per cent to Pounds 18.5m. But while sales
were up 4 per cent in the US division to Dollars 155.6m (Pounds 103.7m),
profits slipped from Dollars 5.5m to Dollars 5.2m.
Earnings increased to 11.6p (10.8p). The company is reducing the disparity
between its final and interim dividends and lifted the interim from 4.3p to
5p.
