FT  29 APR 94 / UK Company News: Laser-Scan jumps to Pounds 113,000


Laser-Scan Holdings, the USM-quoted maker of digital mapping systems and
high resolution laser plotters, reported a jump in pre-tax profits from
Pounds 80,000 to Pounds 113,000 in 1993.
Mr Jim Utterson, chairman, said the improvement was achieved in spite of
continuing difficult economic conditions in most of the group's markets.
Turnover fell to Pounds 9.59m (Pounds 10m) as a result of the impact of the
Inegi contract, most of which was delivered in 1992.
The group launched its Open Systems software platform during the year, and
agreement for its use has been reached with IBM in North America and Ssang
Yong in South Korea. As the group intends to concentrate on developing the
software it is to discontinue the in-house manufacture of Imaging Systems
hardware, the costs of which will be reflected in the 1994 results.
After tax of Pounds 166,000 (Pounds 1,000), losses per share amounted to
0.3p (0.5p earnings).
