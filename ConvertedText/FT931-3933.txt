FT  12 MAR 93 / International Company News: SIP to expand capital by L736bn

SIP, Italy's main telephone utility, yesterday announced a rights issue of
up to L736bn (Dollars 494m), undeterred by a drop in profits to L460.6bn in
1992 from L486.4bn in 1991.
The capital increase, on the basis of 13 new ordinary shares at L1,200 each
for every 100 ordinary or savings shares held, provoked mixed feelings among
analysts. Although widely discounted in the market, the latest increase
follows a string of money-raising exercises by Italy's state-controlled
telecoms groups.
'We don't think it's that all bad,' said one dealer. 'The trouble is, the
amount is relatively small, leading to fears that SIP may be planning
another capital increase soon'. SIP shares, which closed at L1,660 in Milan,
before the deal was announced, slipped by L10 on London's SEAQ system.
Group turnover rose by 10.8 per cent to L21,557bn, while gross earnings
jumped by 36.8 per cent to L998.2bn. The dividend remained unchanged at L75
for ordinary shares and L95 for savings stock.
