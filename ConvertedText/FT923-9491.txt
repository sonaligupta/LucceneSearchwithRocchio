FT  05 AUG 92 / Letter: Investors' dilemma


   From Mr EDMOND JACKSON


Sir, Peter Morgan (Letters, July 31) unintentionally nails the dilemma for
investors who wish to act responsibly.
Clearly, a unitary board is essential for corporate efficiency, and thereby
shareholder value.
But if investors have no say at all in the running of a company, their only
option on detecting problems is to sell out. Instead of nipping them early,
mistakes grow long hair until chronic decline sets in, or a crisis means
expensive action by lawyers and accountants - paid for by shareholders, of
course. Investors are capable of exercising vigilance - especially when
their own money is at stake. But it is no use if, as often at company annual
meetings, boards can simply ignore their views ad lib.
There were sceptics on Maxwell and Polly Peck, but what teeth did they have
to stop the rot before it was too late?
