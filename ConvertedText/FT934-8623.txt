FT  15 NOV 93 / China's trade deficit may reach Dollars 9bn

CHINA appears headed for a Dollars 9bn (Pounds 6.1bn) trade deficit this
year, after imports exceeded exports by more than Dollars 7bn in the 10
months to October. This would be China's first trading account deficit since
1989.
Western economists are predicting that China will register a deficit on its
current account in 1993 of about Dollars 7.5bn. This would compare with a
surplus of Dollars 6.4bn last year.
Customs statistics for October showed imports surged 28.1 per cent to
Dollars 76.4bn and exports reached Dollars 69.3bn - a modest 6.4 per cent
increase over the same period last year.
Mr Fan Baoqing, a trade senior official, blamed the deterioration on
powerful domestic demands and bottlenecks in the transport system that had
hindered exports. Weak growth in leading export markets, and rising domestic
costs also restrained export growth.
The customs statistics showed there had been a slump in the exports of crude
oil, coal, steel, non-ferrous metals, cement and raw silk. China's booming
building sector had taken much of the country's steel and cement output.
A surge in imports of machinery, electronic goods, cars and aircraft had
also contributed to the trade deficit. In the 10 months to October, 227,000
cars were imported and 83 aircraft. This represented increases of nearly 90
and 60 per cent respectively.
Imports of steel and crude oil and derivatives had also risen sharply. Some
23.4m tonnes of rolled steel had been imported, a fourfold increase over the
same 1992 period. Oil imports had risen by 50 per cent.
Foreign exchange reserves at the end of the September quarter stood at
Dollars 18.8bn. foreign debt - most of it longer term - was Dollars 69.3bn
in 1992.
China's slide into the red on its trading and current accounts are not
expected to affect its ability to meet its international obligations.
