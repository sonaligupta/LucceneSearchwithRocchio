FT  12 MAR 92 / Money Markets: Post-Budget blues


ALL lingering hopes of a near-term base rate cut were abandoned by the UK
money market yesterday, and rates swung firmly behind a continuation of the
10 1/2 per cent rate.
The market was uninspired by Tuesday's Budget and was worried it would not
boost the Conservative party's standing in the opinion polls, making an
independent rate cut look highly unlikely.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, has been careful not to rule out the
possibility of breaking with convention and making a cut during the election
campaign. Rumours that the Bank of Spain may be about to make its second
rate cut in three weeks also brought hopes that the UK authorities would not
miss their chance to follow suit this time. But few dealers hold out much
hope.
'There is uncertainty about how the opinion polls will go, how the election
will go, and how the government would finance its borrowing,' said one.
'It's a rather sad and sorry situation.'
'Chances of a rate cut have gone - that is what the market is indicating.'
Interbank rates from one week through to five months moved up to 10 5/8 -10
1/2 per cent, representing an  1/8 per cent increase for the key three-month
rate. The one-year rate firmed  1/4 per cent to 10 9/16 -10 7/16 , making
the yield curve virtually flat.
March short sterling fell to 89.44 from 89.52, while the June contract
plunged to 89.60 from 89.71.
The firmer trend in the period rates was underpinned by expensive day-to-day
funding, with the overnight rate going above 11 per cent in the afternoon.
The Bank of England initially forecast a shortage of around Pounds 800m. It
purchased only Pounds 5m of band 1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent in the
early round, and Pounds 24m of similar bills at midday, after the shortage
was revised upwards to Pounds 900m. In the afternoon, it purchased a further
Pounds 240m of band 1 bank and treasury bills and Pounds 76m of band 2, with
late assistance of Pounds 300m taking the daily total to Pounds 737m.
German call money rates were unchanged at 9.60/65 per cent despite the
anticipated injection of DM3.1bn into the money market in this week's
securities repurchase tender. They should remain firm, as March tax payments
drain funds from the system.
