FT  22 JUL 93 / International Company News: Gengold gains 31% to R100.3m


   By PHILIP GAWITH


THE 10 mines in the Gengold group posted a 31 per cent increase in net
profits to R100.3m (Dollars 30.3m) in the June quarter over the previous
quarter. The group was helped by cost controls and a firmer gold price.
The result was largely due to improved performances at Beatrix,
Buffelsfontein and Kinross. It was achieved on a fall in gold production to
16,742kg from 17,156kg - but an average price rise of 5.5 per cent to
R34,766 per kg.
Mr Gary Maude, managing director, said the better price required the group
to move from using hedging as a survival technique to using it as insurance
against a sudden fall in the price of gold.
He said the group had last sold gold forward in May and would be busy
winding up existing forward positions until May next year. At current gold
prices, Gengold's profits would be 25 per cent to 30 per cent higher were it
not for the group's hedging programme.
The group has used the better gold price to increase capital expenditure,
which at R39.7m was 105.3 per cent higher than in the previous quarter.
Mr Maude said large capital projects would probably be started if, in six
months, the strong gold price had been maintained.
However, he stressed the mines' priority was to secure dividends and that
capital expenditure would not come at their expense.
One disappointing feature of the results was the performance of Grootvlei.
Mr Maude said its future remained threatened, even at the higher gold price,
unless it improved its operational performance.
