FT  24 NOV 92 / Observer: Bull turned


If Canada's Conrad Black thought that taking control of Fairfax, Australia's
second largest newspaper chain, was going to be trouble free, then he
probably didn't listen to his well-placed friends in Britain's Conservative
party.
It is one thing to upset the local journos by replacing most of the Fairfax
editors, it is quite another to fall out with Malcolm Turnbull, the
lawyer-turned-merchant banker, best known for defeating the British
government in the infamous Spycatcher case. As Lord Armstrong, former
Cabinet secretary, will testify, Turnbull has considerably more clout and
stamina than most corporate gadflys.
Turnbull has teamed up with the Australian Shareholders Association to
oppose a new Fairfax executive option scheme. He claims the scheme, which
will be voted on at tomorrow's Fairfax agm, enriches Black's right-hand man,
Dan Colson.
Defeating the motion would be sweet revenge for Turnbull, who received
substantial fees for working on the Fairfax takeover, but was forced to quit
the bidding consortium after a series of blazing rows with Colson.
