FT  01 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Hollinger buys back 200,000 Telegraph
shares


Hollinger, the Canadian publishing company controlled by Mr Conrad Black,
has bought a further 200,000 shares at 348p in The Telegraph as part of its
policy to buy back up to 6.8m ordinary shares.
The share price yesterday fell by 2p to 350p.
When the policy was announced in early October the shares jumped 20p to
330p.
The latest purchase takes Hollinger's holding to 79.2m shares, or 58.51 per
cent of the issued share capital. Mr Black is chairman of both companies.
In May, Hollinger reduced its stake in The Telegraph from 66.2 to 57 per
cent, raising CDollars 152m (Pounds 70.7m), only weeks before the Daily
Telegraph cut its cover price. The share price consequently slumped from
540p to 332p. A London Stock Exchange inquiry cleared Mr Black of any
wrongdoing.
