FT  01 DEC 94 / Observer: How to be a lady's man


Will Sir Leon Brittan ride again? Word is that the big loser in the
share-out of portfolios among the new European commissioners could be eyeing
up one of the two vice-presidencies on offer in the new 20-member
Commission.
The posts may have been largely ceremonial to date, but the vice-presidents
will enjoy rather more room for manoeuvre if the genial new president
Jacques Santer does not assert his authority early on.
By failing to extract a consolation prize last month when he lost his
central and eastern European patches, Sir Leon has of course already passed
up his most obvious chance to go for the role. He huffed and puffed and
threatened to chuck in his entire job as commissioner for external relations
 -thereby eliciting numerous calls for him to stay in Brussels, but also
losing himself standing within the Commission.
Now friends believe his change of heart is not without its pitfalls. Hot
favourite for one of the posts is Karel van Miert, the popular Belgian
commissioner for competition policy. The five new women commissioners - led
by Edith Cresson, the former French prime minister  - meanwhile, spot an
ideal opportunity for one of their own to challenge the image of Brussels as
an exclusive male preserve. So does Sir Leon do the gentlemanly thing and
make way for a woman?
