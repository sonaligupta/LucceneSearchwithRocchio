FT  22 JUL 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Worm's eye view of pollution


   By VANESSA HOULDER


Earthworms are being used to detect the long-term effects of environmental
pollution.
Scientists from the UK's Natural Environment Research Council believe
information from earthworm cells provides a simple, effective technique to
assess the presence of heavy metals, dioxins and other potentially harmful
chemicals.
Body fluid cells are taken from earthworms in contaminated areas. The cells
are then exposed to a dye that is absorbed by the cells' lysosomes. If the
earthworm has been exposed to pollutants, the dye is released rapidly; in
normal earthworms, the dye is released slowly.
This type of 'biomarker' technique is useful in cases where traditional
chemical analysis cannot provide a comprehensive or accurate enough
assessment of the long-term effects of a cocktail of contaminants,
particularly in seas, lakes and rivers.
The earthworm work is one of the first applications of biomarker techniques
on land. It has helped in the assessment of the environmental impacts of
waste products from gold mining in Africa.
