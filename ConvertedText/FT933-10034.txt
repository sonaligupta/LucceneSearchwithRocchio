FT  06 AUG 93 / Labour aims to help small companies


   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent


A POLICY designed to encourage small companies to expand and provide more
jobs will be launched by the Labour party next month.
It reflects the determination of Mr John Smith and the shadow cabinet to
develop an effective strategy for reducing unemployment.
Labour believes the government has not maximised the job opportunities which
can be provided by businesses capable of making the transition from small to
medium size.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, and Mr Derek Fatchett,
industry spokesman, are to tour the country to establish contacts with
owners and managers of small businesses.
Mr Fatchett said yesterday that a policy document would be published towards
the end of next month. Aimed at companies with potential for growth, it will
include:
Schemes to encourage closer co-operation in sectors or areas to strengthen
small companies' bargaining positions when negotiating credit terms with
banks.
Proposals for helping small companies to make greater use of new technology.
Help for small companies over late payment of bills by getting larger
companies to standardise practice in paying their suppliers.
Mr Fatchett stressed that a Labour government would have no more than a
'pilot' role in seeking to strengthen the creditworthiness of small
companies, with limited financial involvement.
