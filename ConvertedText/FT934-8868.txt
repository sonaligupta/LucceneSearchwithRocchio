FT  13 NOV 93 / Clinton is close to winning enough votes in Congress to pass
NAFTA


   By REUTER


   WASHINGTON


PRESIDENT Clinton said yesterday he was close to winning enough votes in
Congress to pass the North American Free Trade Agreement, Reuter reports
from Washington.
'I've got a list that makes me think we can do what we always thought we had
to do,' said Mr Clinton, who is engaged in intense lobbying for the accord
to create a free trade zone among the US, Mexico and Canada.
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen claimed the administration was within 10
votes of the 218 majority needed to win in the House of representatives.
'Between now and the 17th we'll be able to put it over the line,' he said.
Nafta opponents scoff at such claims. Representative David Bonior of
Michigan, a top House Democrat, claims his forces already have 221 pledges
to vote against the pact, three more than the needed majority.
