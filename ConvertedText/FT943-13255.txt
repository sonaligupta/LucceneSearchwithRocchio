FT  20 JUL 94 / International Company News: Merrill Lynch tumbles 37% as
currency swings take toll


   By RICHARD WATERS


Merrill Lynch's post-tax profits tumbled by 37 per cent in the second
quarter, compared with a year ago, as the upheaval in US and foreign
financial markets took their toll.
However, the dominance of the US securities underwriting business and
further growth in assets under management supported earnings, enabled it to
report an impressive 18.5 per cent return on equity during the period.
Mr Dan Tully, chairman and chief executive, called the three months to June
'the most difficult operating environment for our industry in over three
years'.
He blamed rising interest rates, unsettled currency markets, investor
caution and a fall-off in the issuance of new securities worldwide for the
second quarter fall in earnings.
Volatility in the markets led to a fall in profits from principal
transactions to Dollars 561m, a quarter lower than a year before.
The drop in underwriting revenues led to a 22 per cent fall in investment
banking revenues, to Dollars 322m, although Merrill claimed 17 per cent of
the US underwriting business and 14 per cent of underwriting worldwide.
As a result, revenues nonetheless dropped 6 per cent from the 1993 period,
to Dollars 2.4bn, despite a 3 per cent rise in commissions, to Dollars 691m.
With non-interest costs flat at Dollars 2bn, net income during the period
fell to Dollars 252m, or Dollars 1.18 a share, from Dollars 345m, or Dollars
1.51, a year before, when the strong financial markets had pushed Merrill to
a return on equity of 22.9 per cent.
For the first six months, net income fell to Dollars 624m, or Dollars 2.87 a
share, from Dollars 852m, or Dollars 3.03, in the first half of 1993.
