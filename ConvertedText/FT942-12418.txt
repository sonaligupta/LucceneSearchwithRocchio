   By JOHN GAPPER


Abbey National, the bank and mortgage lender, yesterday disclosed pre-tax
profits 20 per cent higher for the first quarter of the year, compared with
1993, while directors said there was 'a clear upward trend in the housing
market', writes John Gapper.
Lord Tugendhat, chairman, said at the annual meeting that there was 'a
positive outlook' for 1994, with the UK retail banking provisions charge
expected to be lower over the year.
He added that Abbey's policy of locking in a spread on its investments meant
that treasury operations had been 'little affected'
Abbey announced it was applying to join the Personal Investment Authority,
which is to take over responsibility for personal financial services
regulation in July.
