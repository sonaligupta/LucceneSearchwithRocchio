FT  12 NOV 92 / Moscow threatens gas flow to Baltics


   By REUTER


   MOSCOW


THE RUSSIAN government has threatened to cut off gas supplies to the Baltic
states unless they accept a new plan to finance Russian troops based on
their territories, Reuter reports from Moscow quoting Itar-Tass news agency.
Under the plan, gas exported to Estonia and Latvia would be partly paid for
in Estonian kroons or Latvia's national currency, which is yet to be
introduced. A similar scheme is planned for Lithuania.
The money would be paid into branches of Russian banks in each state for
withdrawal by the troops. Russia would provide extra support in freely
convertible roubles.
Tass said Russia would cut off gas to the three Baltic states if they failed
to recognise non-cash transfers from the Russian bank.
Last week President Boris Yeltsin ordered withdrawal of the troops from all
three Baltic states to be suspended because of what he called discrimination
against Russian minorities. But he later said the troops would quit
Lithuania as agreed by mid-1993.
