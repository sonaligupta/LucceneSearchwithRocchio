FT  10 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Raine linked to Lovell


   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE, and STEVE THOMPSON


SHARES in YJ Lovell, the troubled Buckinghamshire-based construction group,
moved up strongly amid suggestions that Raine Industries had acquired a
significant stake in the group.
Lovell touched 23p before ending a busy session 4 ahead at 22p. Raine
Industries fell sharply to close 10 1/2 off at 102 1/2 p, with the market
concerned at the prospect of Raine bidding for Lovell.
Turnover in Lovell as reported by Seaq was 846,000 shares but the trading
screens showed a series of delayed trades carried out at 22p and 24p, which
were expected to be recorded on the Seaq overnight ticker. It was these
trades which were thought to contain a number of big deals.
Earlier in the session there had been rumours that Taylor Woodrow, the
construction group, which acquired a near 5 per cent stake in Lovell in a
market raid carried out last June, was about to launch a full takeover bid
for Lovell.
Lovell shares plummeted late last year after the group, crippled by
deteriorating conditions in the UK and US housing and property markets,
warned of heavy losses, that it would pass its final dividend and that it
would breach its banking covenants.
US buyers of Glaxo
The price of Glaxo continued to rise yesterday, against the expectations of
a number of UK analysts, and reached another all-time high. US buying
reversed early weakness in the shares, finally adding a further Pounds 1bn
to the company's market value.
The stock was off 12 in early trading, discouraged by speculation, later
denied, that Barclays de Zoete Wedd had recommended a switch into SmithKline
Beecham. There was also some talk of a Cazenove downgrade.
Then, the US buyers moved in during the afternoon and sent the shares
rocketing through their chart barrier. They jumped 4.29 per cent or 38 on
balance to close at 923p.
Pharmaceutical group Smith & Nephew attracted attention throughout the day
as confusion reigned over a possible legal settlement in the US.
Traders reacted to unverified reports that the company was close to a deal
to cut damages it was due to pay to US concern Polteco. Suggestions were
that damages would be only around Dollars 37m, compared with the Dollars 96m
formerly threatened, and the shares picked up by around 5 per cent.
However, no announcement appeared on the Stock Exchange information service
and the company said it had not released any statement on the matter and
would not comment further.
Later, the Stock Exchange and Kleinwort Benson, Smith's broker, announced an
inquiry into the leak. The shares rose to 144p before closing almost 5 up at
141 1/4 p, the highest price since November 1989. Turnover of about 12m
shares made Smith prominent in the market's list of active stocks.
Wellcome demand
Strength in Wellcome was helped by a buy note from Goldman Sachs, the US
investment bank. The shares, which are traditionally tightly traded,
advanced 35 to 1043p on high turnover of 3m.
Goldman was active after its pharmaceuticals analyst Mr Paul Krikler
improved his stance on the stock to a 'trading buy'. Mr Krikler decided that
the shares had returned to the level at which they stood before recent press
comment on potential Aids treatments prompted an overheated rally. He said
yesterday: 'We believe Wellcome has the strongest earnings per share growth
of the major drug companies.'
Another bout of pronounced weakness in the life assurance sector was
attributed to a bearish note published by UBS Phillips & Drew. Legal &
General, by far the poorest performer in the FT-SE 100 index yesterday, fell
10 to 365p, having lost 9 in the previous session. Prudential eased 2 to
233p, additionally unsettled by news that County NatWest had removed the
stock from its buy list.
Mr Youssef Ziai, UBS life assurance analyst, said he had shifted his stance
on Legal from buy to hold and that for Prudential from hold to sell. He
cited political uncertainty for the change in stance, arguing that Labour
party policy towards taxation and pensions was a 'significant negative for
the life sector'.
Sentiment in Greycoat improved as the property company contacted brokers to
give assurances that the Pounds 130m financing for its Embankment Place
development would be in place shortly. The shares, which dropped 22 on
Wednesday, ended only 2 lower at 74p. County NatWest yesterday confirmed its
downgrading of Greycoat's net asset value (nav) - wrongly reported yesterday
 -as 250p for this year, down from 301p, and to 200p from 312p for 1993.
Hammerson rebounded on the strength of the dollar following the stock's
steep fall on Wednesday. The group has a large overseas property portfolio.
The ordinary shares picked up 14 to 532p, while the 'A' improved 10 to 464p.
County downgraded Hammerson's nav by 73 to 655p. A stock overhang pulled
Chesterfield Properties down 15 to 410p.
Institutions reacted positively to news that packaging company API had
appointed Mr Moger Woolley, formerly chief executive of the DRG packaging
group, as non-executive chairman. The shares gained 20 to 123p with Credit
Lyonnais Laing (CLL) a heavy buyer.
A series of post-Christmas downgrades by CLL brought significant
underperformance by the food retailing giants. Mr Tony Shiret, food
retailing specialist at CLL, lowered his current year estimate for J.
Sainsbury by Pounds 10m to Pounds 610m, that for Tesco by the same amount to
Pounds 540m, and that for Argyll by Pounds 9m to Pounds 360m. Mr Shiret
said: 'Despite the late run on the food shops pre-Christmas the overall
result disappointed'.
Tesco fell 7 1/2 to 217p on 6.8m, while Sainsbury dipped 4 to 364p on 2m.
Argyll could manage only a minor gain at 287p with 7.5m shares traded. UBS
Phillips & Drew was also thought to have reduced its estimate for Tesco.
There were suspicions that a stakebuilder could have been at work in
Boddingtons, the brewer, after a number of delayed trades which did not show
up during market hours. The shares rose 7 1/2 to 170 1/2 p.
Oil shares extended their recent rally. BP gained a further 9 1/2 to 283 1/2
p on turnover of 11m, with much of yesterday's support said to have come
from Smith New Court after the broker highlighted the stock's yield
attractions and said the market had previously been over-optimistic about
BP's dividend policy.
Smith was also said to have been behind a steep rise in Burmah Castrol after
visiting the company on Tuesday. Mr Nick Clayton at Smith said Burmah shares
were oversold and looked more attractive now than at any time for the past
two years. The stock closed 18 higher at 490p. Shell, where volume reached
7m, added 6 at 476p.
Sheffield Insulation plunged 25 to 85p as one of the big integrated
securities houses was said to have drastically cut its current year
estimates. Sheffield's figures are due at the end of March.
A reported downgrading by Cazenove sent Lucas Group down 5 to 109p.
Cazenove, which acts as broker to Lucas, declined to comment on the move.
Hotel group Forte entered County NatWest's top-30 share list, analyst Ms
Julie Farrar citing an improved room occupancy rate and good recovery
prospects. The shares edged up 2 to 231p. Thorn EMI were also added to the
list of 30 best buys and raced up 15 to 763p.
Nomura became the latest broker to put Granada Group on its buy list, the
shares gaining 6 to 210p in hefty turnover of 6m. Confidence in new chief
executive Mr Gerry Robinson and optimism over BSkyB's chances of recovery
were two other prominent reasons driving the price upwards.
A positive sales forecast from Airbus helped British Aerospace gain 11 to
322p in moderate volume of 3.1m. Traders also said that the shares are still
relatively cheap after their recent battering.
