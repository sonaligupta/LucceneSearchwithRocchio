   MOSCOW


RUSSIA yesterday urged Ukraine to reconsider its wish to retain for the time
being some former Soviet missiles, saying the move threatened world
stability and nuclear safety, Reuter reports from Moscow.
Interfax news agency quoted a government statement as saying Ukraine's moves
to assert control over some of the nuclear arms on its territory violated
its international obligations and could not be accepted by Moscow.
'This is fraught with serious consequences for world stability and safety,'
the statement said.
