FT  26 OCT 92 / UK stock market flotations fall sharply


   By RICHARD GOURLAY


ECONOMIC uncertainty and the crisis of confidence in government policy have
cut the number of companies floating on the UK stock market.
However, small, growing companies are increasingly likely to raise capital
through flotations, said KPMG Peat Marwick, the international management
consultancy.
Only 20 companies floated in the third quarter of 1992, down from 28 in the
same period last year. So far this year there have been 52 flotations,
compared with 91 in the whole of 1991 and 203 in 1986, the peak year.
This trend could reverse as the economy moves out of recession. Companies
needing to raise funds to expand would be increasingly attracted to the
stock market, according to Mr Neil Austin, head of new issues at KPMG.
Banks, a traditional source of such funds, have become nervous about
lending, especially as the value of assets, which provide security for
loans, has fallen.
The banks are cutting the amount they will lend on assets and are more
reluctant to use a borrower's inventory as collateral than they were three
years ago.
More flotations are expected as backers of the late-1980s management
buy-outs seek an exit. Managers of those companies prefer a float to a trade
sale to retain independence.
The forecast increase in small company flotations comes when brokers are
ceasing to make markets in smaller stocks.
