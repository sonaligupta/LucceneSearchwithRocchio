FT  16 MAR 94 / Mahathir likely to gain control of Sabah assembly


   By KIERAN COOKE


   KOTA KINABALU, EAST MALAYSIA


The national front coalition government in Malaysia led by Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad appears likely to assume power in the state of Sabah, East
Malaysia, after several members of the dominant local political party voiced
support for Dr Mahathir.
Sabah is one of only two states in the Malaysian federation not controlled
by parties in Dr Mahathir's national front. In bitterly fought state
elections last month the locally constituted Parti Bersatu Sabah (PBS), led
by Mr Joseph Pairin Kitingan, the chief minister, narrowly defeated the
national front and retained its control of the Sabah assembly.
But in recent days PBS's majority has been threatened by a number of
defections by its assembly members to the national front. Yesterday Mr
Jeffrey Kitingan, a younger brother of the chief minister who was elected as
a PBS assemblyman in last month's elections, announced he was forming a
political party which would join Dr Mahathir's national front coalition.
Mr Jeffrey Kitingan, who was recently released after being detained for
three years on suspicion of wanting to take Sabah out of the Malaysian
federation, has said that Sabah could progress and develop through
membership of the national front.
Dr Mahathir has made no secret of his antagonism to the PBS and to Mr Pairin
Kitingan in particular. The PBS accuses Dr Mahathir of withholding federal
funding for Sabah's development and says the national front has paid
millions of dollars to win support of PBS assembly members.
The national front now seems certain to command a majority in the state
assembly, which is due to hold its first meeting on Friday since the recent
election. Earlier this week Mr Pairin Kitingan asked the Sabah governor to
dissolve the assembly and for new elections to be held.
