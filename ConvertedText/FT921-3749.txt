FT  12 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Buoyant Vimto sales behind JN Nichols rise


   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY


Rising sales of Vimto helped JN Nichols (Vimto), the Manchester-based soft
drinks manufacturer, to an 8.5 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds
7.1m to Pounds 7.71m in 1991.
The advance was achieved in spite of a 5.6 per cent decline in turnover from
Pounds 49.8m to Pounds 47m as a result of a drop in contract canning.
A poor British summer and the recession failed to damage Vimto, with cordial
sales up 12 per cent and a small increase in sales of bottled carbonates.
Sales of canned Vimto were down 5 per cent, but the company estimates that
there was a downturn of some 12 per cent for the industry as a whole.
Growth continued at Cabana Soft Drinks and Nichols Foods. Earnings per share
rose to 32.6p (28.5p) and a final dividend of 7.7p is proposed making a
total for the year of 12.3p (11p).
