FT  22 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Shandwick granted new facilities


   By RICHARD GOURLAY


Bankers to Shandwick, one of the world's largest public relations agencies,
have agreed to extend facilities to the company until the end of January
1994.
Mr John Huckle, Shandwick finance director, said the early renewal of the
facility, which was due to expire next March, provided a 'positive'
atmosphere for the group's recovery.
The facility amounts to Pounds 69m at current exchange rates in sterling and
foreign currencies.
Shandwick's shares price collapsed from 149p a year ago after the group
severely disappointed with its results and breached some of its banking
covenants.
Yesterday the shares recovered 1 1/2 p to close at 9 1/2 p.
Mr Huckle said Shandwick had been able to prove that cash flow was stronger
than previously expected.
