FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Visa EMEA spending rises 13% to Dollars
183bn


   By ALISON SMITH


The amount of spending using Visa cards within the Europe, Middle East and
Africa region (EMEA) totalled Dollars 183bn (Pounds 125.3bn) in 1993, some
13 per cent higher than in 1992.
The number of Visa EMEA card transactions rose by almost 5 per cent to
2.36bn, while the number of Visa cards in existence rose by more than 5 per
cent to 70.8m.
Mr Jean-Jacques Desbons, president and chief executive of Visa EMEA, said
the organisation was confident that growth 'will continue throughout the
next year and will increase further as the world economy starts picking up.'
Both the increases in card-holder spending in terms of US dollars and in the
number of cards in 1993 against the previous year are lower in percentage
terms than annual increases since 1989.
Mr Desbons also said Visa planned to introduce its Electron card into the UK
before the end of the year. It is already available elsewhere and can be
used only through electronic means. Because each transaction would be
authorised individually by the banks, the card would offer greater security,
and so banks might be prepared to make it available to more of their
customer base than existing cards.
Visa EMEA represents about 36 per cent of Visa International's worldwide
sales volume.
