FT  27 SEP 94 / International Company News: La Generale improves 53% in
first six months

Societe Generale de Belgique, the diversified Belgian holding company,
increased its net earnings by 53 per cent in the first half of the year to
BFr6.7bn (Dollars 210m) compared with BFr4.4bn in the previous corresponding
period.
Mr Etienne Davignon, president, said all shareholdings made an increased
contribution to earnings in terms of both ordinary activities and net
earnings, with Tractebel, the Belgian energy group, making the strongest
contribution to overall growth.
Tractebel's success was mainly due to an improvement in the electrical
sector.
Mr Davignon said there would be no change in its shareholding in Accor, the
French hotels group, which would remain at 12.2 per cent.
He told a press conference that Mr Karel Vinck was shortly to succeed Mr
Jean-Pierre Rodier as the head of Union Miniere.
La Generale's consolidated earnings were up 38 per cent in the first half of
the year. The group forecast that in spite of a generally poor economic
climate, it would be able to achieve earnings this year 'which are at least
equivalent to those of 1993'.
During the first half of the year the group's service sector activities had
continued to improve steadily, while the industrial companies benefited from
a pick-up in their markets or, as in the case of Union Miniere, from the
benefits of internal restructuring.
There was a marked increase in the earnings of Fortis to BFr888m in the six
months to June this year, from BFr579m in the first half of 1993.
Earnings from Generale de Banque, Belgium's largest bank, rose to BFr1.57bn
against BFr1.2bn in the first half of 1993.
Union Miniere returned to profit in the first half of the year after losses
of BFr449m in the first half of 1993.
The BFr148m in after-tax profits for the six months to June was attributed
almost exclusively to a new management approach within the company.
