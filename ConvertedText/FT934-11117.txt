for Dr80bn

THE Greek government hopes to raise at least Dr80bn (Dollars 343m) from the
sale of eight new casino licences to international operators by the end of
this year.
Although the new socialist government has halted most projects included in
its predecessor's privatisation programme, the casino scheme is to go ahead
as planned, according to the economy ministry.
Hyatt International, Sheraton, and Conrad Hilton are among 16 bidders
shortlisted to set up and manage casinos in Athens, Thessaloniki and the
resort islands of Corfu, Crete and Mykonos.
Under the licensing terms, the Greek state will take a 20 per cent cut of
the casinos' earnings. Remaining profits will be taxed at the local
corporate rate of 35 per cent. The licences will have a 15-year duration.
In addition to producing estimated revenues of at least Dr120bn yearly, the
casino project will upgrade Greece's tourist industry by ensuring investment
in luxury hotel facilities.
Under the terms of the licence, the casino operators would construct or
refurbish hotels or resorts where the casinos are to be located.
Hyatt Casino Corporation, the group's gaming subsidiary, would invest
Dollars 200m in a luxury hotel and casino on a greenfield site in an Athens
suburb. ITT Sheraton is bidding to acquire Ionian Hotels, the
state-controlled company which owns the Athens Hilton.
Conrad Hilton of the US, would invest up to Dollars 300m in building a
casino complex and new hotel at a state-owned resort at Vouliagmeni near
Athens. The company has signed a contract to manage the resort, in
association with the Alex Spanos group, a California-based property
developer.
Greece's three existing casinos, which are operated by the state tourist
authority, would shut down to make way for the private operators.
