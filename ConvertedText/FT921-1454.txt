FT  24 MAR 92 / Pay rise of 17.6% for gas chief sparks Labour attack


   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES and ALISON SMITH


A 17.6 per cent pay rise last year for the chairman of British Gas, Mr
Robert Evans, sparked controversy yesterday.
British Gas revealed that Mr Evans earned Pounds 435,222 last year including
a bonus related to earnings per share of some Pounds 84,512, compared with
Pounds 370,083 the previous year. The company made after-tax profits of
Pounds 1.16bn last year resulting in earnings per share of 27.3p.
Coming in the middle of the election campaign, news of Mr Evans' pay rise
unleashed a strong attack from the Labour party. Mr Frank Dobson, the
party's energy spokesman, called it 'another example of the sheer unrivalled
greed which has been let loose by setting up privatised monopolies'.
The scale of the pay rise is likely to embarrass the Conservatives in the
campaign. The government has come under fire for failing to regulate the
salaries of the chairmen of privatised utilities.
But Mr John Major said yesterday that pay levels must be a matter for the
companies concerned. However, he added, 'as I have repeatedly made clear, I
believe chairmen should exercise leadership in questions of pay'.
White-collar workers at British Gas warned that the chairman's salary
increase would influence current pay talks where 33,000 members of the Nalgo
union have put in a claim for an increase in excess of inflation.
Mr Alan Jinkinson, Nalgo's general secretary said: 'Coming in the middle of
a general election campaign we can see clearly what fairness and equity mean
to high income earners . . . This is RPI plus 400 per cent and far exceeds
any increase in dividends.'
British Gas recently agreed a pay increase of 4.25 per cent with its craft
and manual workers.
