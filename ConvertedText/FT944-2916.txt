FT  15 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Cost cutting behind Chubb's rise to 15%


   By TIM BURT


Chubb Security yesterday reported a 15 per cent increase in first half
profits as the electronic alarms and locks group reaped the benefits of its
cost reduction programme.
As part of the four-year programme, launched last year, the group has sold
lossmaking operations, endured large redundancies and unveiled new products
in a bid to improve margins and market share.
Mr David Peacock, chief executive, said those measures had begun to pay off
with pre-tax profits rising from Pounds 34.2m to Pounds 39.2m in the six
months to October 14.
Turnover showed a more modest rise to Pounds 371.8m (Pounds 355.2m),
including Pounds 2.55m (Pounds 3.88m) from discontinued activities, giving a
5 per cent increase in underlying sales.
However, Mr Peacock said the group had seen orders grow by 10 per cent from
Pounds 353m to Pounds 388m, with demand strengthening in several markets.
The rise was particularly marked in Asia and Australasia, where operating
profits rose sharply from Pounds 11.3m to Pounds 14m, confirming its second
place to the UK, where profits were unchanged at Pounds 17.7m.
Physical security - locks and safes - saw profits rise to Pounds 19.4m
(Pounds 17.4m) while electronic security - alarms and fire detection - rose
to Pounds 19m (Pounds 18.1m).
Mr Peacock said the first half performance meant it was now halfway to
meeting its target of increasing its share in the Pounds 7.2bn world market
from 9.5 per cent to 11 per cent.
'We've done this after just 18 months of a our four-year programme.'
While aggressively pursuing increased market share, the group has also sold
its lossmaking alarms division in France and locks business in Australia,
and set aside Pounds 2.88m to cover first half redundancies and
reorganisation.
The cost of such measures, put at Pounds 4.5m a year during the cost
reduction programme, was offset by strong cash generation, which during the
period rose Pounds 7.2m to Pounds 42.5m.
Earnings per share rose to 8.2p (7.08p) and the interim dividend is raised
16 per cent to 2.32p (2p).
COMMENT
Solid rather than sparkling, these figures were nonetheless creditable for a
company which has yet to complete its 'pain first, gain later'
restructuring. Although sales were slightly below expectations, the growth
in orders suggests the strategy is working. The group has saved Pounds 23m
in the first phase of cost-cutting and its emphasis on new products and
emerging markets promises long-term rewards. With margins growing steadily,
full-year profits are likely to reach Pounds 88m, giving a p/e of 15.3. The
shares, down 5p at 293p, look fairly priced, given that they touched 424p
earlier this year.
