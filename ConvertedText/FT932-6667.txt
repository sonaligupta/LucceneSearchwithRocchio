FT  27 MAY 93 / Observer: Lame duck


Determined to sell its policies to the Brits, the European Commission has
hired a public relations outfit called Kestrel whose press releases on EC
consumer protection measures have since flown far and wide. What they
haven't been doing, alas, is flying fast.
Take, for example, last month's attempt to interest the media in EC product
liability law. It fell flat, achieving only one small and bilious snippet in
the whole of the national press. Perhaps that was because the law is five
years old.
To cap that, however, the 'News-Urgent' missive that winged its way to the
nation's editors yesterday managed to be both too late and too early at the
same time. Its subject was a consumer contracts directive adopted by EC
ministers seven weeks ago, which will not take effect until 1995.
