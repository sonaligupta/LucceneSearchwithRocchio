FT  27 SEP 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Wanted, executives in
search of a job - In A Nutshell


Talking of recycling assets, the Connect for Growth programme sponsored by
London TECs is still looking for unemployed executives to match with smaller
companies seeking to take on additional managers.
Set up a year ago by The Enterprise Partnership, a London-based consultancy,
the programme has already 'matched' 100 companies with previously unemployed
executives. After a short refresher course, executives join a growing
company for a three-month project or trial.
During this period, the company pays only Pounds 500 to the Enterprise
Partnership, while the government's training for work scheme picks up the
cost of paying the executive. The Enterprise Partnership - 071 627 4991
