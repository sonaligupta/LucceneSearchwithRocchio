FT  28 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy trade in Lasmo


   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRIS PRICE and PETER JOHN.


The Lasmo stakebuilding/takeover story that has been bubbling since the
group announced its Pounds 219m rights issue two weeks ago burst into the
open yesterday when Enterprise Oil admitted that it was considering a bid
for the oil exploration group.
The story took a further turn late in the day when rumours swept the market
that British Gas was about to wade in with a 180p a share bid. It was Gas
that triggered the flurry of takeover bids - involving Britoil, Lasmo and
Tricentrol - in the late 1980s when it launched an unsuccessful dawn raid on
Lasmo.
The Enterprise statement triggered a fresh flurry of activity in Lasmo
shares which raced to 167p before closing 9 1/2 higher at 162 1/2 p on
turnover of 44m. The nil-paids leapt 8 1/2 to 57 1/2 p with 7.2m traded. The
traded options were the market's most active with the equivalent of 7.6m
shares changing hands.
Enterprise shocked the market and triggered an immediate mark-down of its
own shares which hit a low of 425p before rallying to close 6 off at 445p.
Dealers said the recovery came as the market picked up the scent of a
British Gas bid which would enable Enterprise to walk away from what is
being viewed as an increasingly expensive acquisition.
Analysts were perplexed at Enterprise's role in the saga; 'If they wanted to
bid for Lasmo why did not they move a couple of months ago when the company
was in real trouble, with no real management and big financial problems?'
said one specialist. Gas shares, weak earlier this week as talk of a
possible bid for Lasmo circulated, eased 2 1/2 more to 295p.
