FT  20 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zinc squeeze fades as stocks
soar - Week in the markets


   By DAVID BLACKWELL


THE SHENANIGANS in the zinc market appeared to have fizzled out by the end
of the week - but not before turning attention once more on how the London
Metal Exchange should act when faced with a squeeze.
On Monday the extent of the technical squeeze became apparent as the
backwardation, or premium paid for cash zinc over metal for delivery in
three months, soared to Dollars 217 a tonne, compared with Dollars 115 on
Friday last week.
On Tuesday the backwardation reached Dollars 240, and traders said that
during the late afternoon Dollars 60 a tonne was being paid to 'borrow' (buy
cash and sell forward) zinc just for one day. They were quick to point out
that during a similarly tight market in December 1989 the LME executive
imposed a limit of Dollars 20 a tonne on the daily backwardation.
Fundamentally there is an abundance of zinc, as can be seen from the surge
of stocks into LME warehouses this week - a rise of 14,675 tonnes on Monday
and 19,650 tonnes on Thursday to reach a total of 102,775 tonnes, the
highest level since November 1983.
Metallgesellschaft, the German group whose clients controlled most of the
zinc available for delivery in April, denied that it was trying to squeeze
the market. Some of its associates had turned to the LME to cover sales
contracts which they might have had difficulty filling because of other
problems, the group explained. It cited the poor performance of Cominco's
lead-zinc refinery in Canada, shipments from MIM delayed by floods in
Australia, the prospective closure of the Berzelius refinery in Germany for
a refit, and an expected shortfall in production at the Rheinzink smelter.
The LME executive had known for some time that a technical squeeze was
developing. But rather than acting officially, traders and analysts
suggested that the LME was using diplomatic pressure to maintain an orderly
market.
An official from Metallgesellschaft said on Monday that its customers had
all agreed to ensure that the market remained liquid. But he also hoped that
market users short of zinc had good reasons for their positions. 'Our
clients are zinc miners, smelters, refiners and dealers and I have no
sympathy for anyone who deliberately sells zinc they do not own to push the
price down just because a trend line on a chart crosses a particular point.'
By Thursday the bubble had burst, and the backwardation was right down to
Dollars 53.50 a tonne. Market talk suggested that a deal had been done by
Metallgesellschaft and the main investment fund victim of the squeeze, said
to be the Californian-based Mint Fund, 50-per-cent-owned by ED & F. Man, the
London trade house.
Yesterday cash zinc closed at Dollars 1,201.50 a tonne, down Dollars 121 on
the week, with the backwardation stood at Dollars 32 a tonne.
The episode could prove damaging to the LME's image, especially as the LME
price is now the benchmark for world trade in zinc. Analysts and traders
also fear that prices will now be driven to unnecessarily low levels.
Mr Angus MacMillan, analyst with Billiton-Enthoven, expects a test of
Dollars 1,150 soon, asserting that 'supply disruptions are built into the
price.'
On the bullion market gold has retreated below Dollars 360 a fine ounce,
closing yesterday at Dollars 356.45, a fall of Dollars 4.30 on the week. The
price has been dragged down to the bottom of its current Dollars 355-Dollars
370 range by losses in silver, coupled with the strength of the dollar,
suggest Mr Andy Smith, precious metals analyst with Union Bank of
Switzerland.
Sugar prices have continued to retreat. The London Daily Price for raws was
Dollars 207 a tonne yesterday, down Dollars 17.60 on the week and the lowest
level since December 1987.
Several new bearish factors emerged this week, not least among them the
latest report on the market from Czarnikow, the London trade house, which
revised upwards its production forecasts for both China and Thailand.
Earlier in the season it was feared that Thai production would fall below
the 3.5m tonnes of last year, but Czarnikow now thinks the country's output
could be just under 4m tonnes. The report also reckons that Chinese output
will not fall far short of domestic consumption at 7.2m tonnes.
India said this week that it was raising its export limit for sugar this
season by a further 100,000 tonnes to 525,000 tonnes. In addition, there is
market talk that a five-year deal between Australia and the Soviet Union for
1.5m tonnes could be in jeopardy.
