FT  28 APR 94 / MPs urge tough minicab rules


   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent


Tough regulation of the unlicensed minicab trade was called for yesterday by
MPs in response to last October's green paper on taxis and private-hire
vehicles.
The MPs reject any form of de-regulation of the industry and demand strict
safety rules for taxis and minicabs under a new national two-tier system.
In a report on the industry, the Commons transport committee says it has
received alarming evidence of attacks by drivers on passengers, accidents
involving uninsured vehicles and poor vehicle safety standards.
The MPs say passengers should be able to tell whether a vehicle is licensed
before getting into it. All minicabs should be required to display a
prominent badge showing they are licensed and an easily legible certificate
of insurance.
Under the proposed new system for both mini-cabs and taxis:
Anyone with a criminal record for sex offences or serious crimes of violence
would be banned for life from working as a driver.
Applicants for licences would have to pass a medical test similar to that
required for bus and coach drivers.
Drivers would have to be aged over 21 with at least three years' driving
experience and a clean licence.
They would also have to have first aid qualifications, be able to speak
English to a standard enabling good communication with the public, and be
trained in disability awareness.
The MPs want a new law to raise minicab standards throughout the country
while safeguarding the right of taxis alone to ply for hire.
