rise 22%

LIBERTY LIFE, South Africa's largest listed life insurance company, reported
a 22 per cent rise in per-share earnings to 155 cents for 1992, from 127
cents the year before.
Liberty - which has close ties with TransAtlantic, the UK listed financial
services group, and UAP, the leading French insurer - increased total income
before tax by 23 per cent to R4.85bn (Dollars 1.5bn) from R3.94bn.
This consisted of a 31 per cent increase in net premium income and annuity
considerations to R2.98bn from R2.27bn, and a 13 per cent increase in
investment income to R1.88bn from R1.66bn.
New annualised recurring premiums, a key benchmark of growth in the
industry, rose by 22 per cent to R577m from R474m, against the background of
a shrinking South African economy. Total new business was 36 per cent up at
R1.7bn against R1.25bn. The dividend, declared last month, rose to 132 cents
per share from 108 cents.
Mr Donald Gordon, chairman, said he was confident the group would maintain
20 per cent growth in earnings during 1993. Shareholders' capital at the
year end amounted to R8.5bn against R8.1bn a year earlier and total assets
came to R35.7bn compared with R34.5bn.
Mr Gordon said the group had three main aims for the next three to five
years.
They were: increasing its exposure to the UK insurance sector through
TransAtlantic; consolidating UK property interests held via Capital and
Counties, a TransAtlantic subsidiary, probably involving 'another major
acquisition'; and a 'significant' acquisition of a North American life
insurer.'
