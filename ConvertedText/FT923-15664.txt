FT  01 JUL 92 / International Company News: Daily News granted one-month
extension


   By ALAN FRIEDMAN and AP-DJ


   NEW YORK


A US bankruptcy court has approved a one-month extension - until the end of
July - of the deadline by which The New York Daily News has to file its
reorganisation plan under Chapter 11 of US bankruptcy law.
The postponement will give more time for talks with prospective buyers of
the New York tabloid, which was bought by the late Mr Robert Maxwell in
1991.
The two main contenders for The News are Mr Conrad Black, the Canadian
publisher who also owns the Daily Telegraph in London, and Mr Mortimer
Zuckerman, the property developer who owns US News and World Report and
Atlantic Monthly magazine.
The key issues for both bidders are the reaching of an agreement with the
trade unions representing the newspaper's 2,100 full and part-time workers
and the settling of claims by the paper's creditors.
Mr Black has already offered to set aside Dollars 75m for severance
payments, working capital and his offer to pay between 25 and 50 cents on
the dollar to creditors who are owed Dollars 43m. Mr Zuckerman is believed
to be his making proposals to union leaders this week.
CBS/FOX FILM, the home-video venture of CBS and Twentieth Century-Fox with
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, said they have settled a lawsuit in which CBS accused
MGM of cheating CBS/Fox out of video cassette rights to successful films,
AP-DJ reports from New York. Terms of the settlement were not disclosed.
A class action lawsuit has been filed by a New Jersey consumer against
Sears, Roebuck, the US retail chain, on behalf of people who paid Sears for
allegedly unnecessary and/or over-priced car repair services, AP-DJ reports.
The allegations include installation of parts that were not necessary, or
charges for repair services that were not performed.
