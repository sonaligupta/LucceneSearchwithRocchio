FT  19 MAY 92 / Observer: The politics of broking


It may have taken US business tycoons such as the Rockefellers several
generations to move into politics, but in Russia it all seems to be
happening at once. Konstantin Borovoi, who founded the Russian Commodities
Exchange and the Russian Stock Exchange, has now started his own political
party.
The Economic Freedom Party, dedicated to 'protecting economic liberty', was
founded at a meeting of 3,000 brokers in his exchange. Not surprisingly, it
unanimously voted Borovoi chairman.
The chairman, a former maths professor, denied his move was prompted by
falling profits in his exchange since the January price rises made commodity
dealing less profitable. Instead, he said, he had finally succumbed to two
years of pressure from 'famous political and public leaders of liberal
orientation' who had consistently nagged him to found a party.
There is now, he said, 'a vast social group, people who represent a new
economy'. Altogether it numbers around 40m people and 'so far it has no
political power,' he says.
The desideratum for those who wish to be associated with the party? 'High
moral standards,' says Borovoi, who claims he never pays bribes.
