FT  23 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Glaxo hit by Zantac concerns


Bad news continued to dog Glaxo, the UK's leading pharmaceuticals group, as
the spectre of a long running legal suit returned to haunt it, sending the
shares into retreat. The news comes only a week after the market came to
terms with news of big losses in its Pounds 2.2bn investment portfolio.
The shares, which are also actively traded in New York, had performed
strongly in early London dealing as they responded to the rise in the
dollar.
Then in the afternoon the company announced it had issued patent
infringement proceedings against Novopharm, a Canadian generics company
which is attempting to get around Glaxo's US patent on Zantac, the
anti-ulcer treatment which is Glaxo's biggest selling drug. Glaxo is already
suing Ciba, which plans to sell a generic version of Zantac in the US in
1996. Within minutes Novopharm put out a statement saying that it was
counter-suing Glaxo for Dollars 300m.
There was a rush to sell the stock particularly in the US and after being 10
higher the shares ended the day 14 lower at 574p with turnover boosted to
5.5m shares.
As the market closed the story became even murkier with claims from some
analysts that a version of Zantac, known as Form 1, was already being sold
in New Zealand and Denmark. If true it would undermine Glaxo's claims that
Form 1 is innately unstable.
