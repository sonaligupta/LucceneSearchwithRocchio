FT  07 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Hopes on growth take Dow over
3,800 level

Wall Street
Cyclical stocks lifted the bellwether Dow Jones Industrial Average above the
3,800 level for the first time yesterday, as investors gained confidence
from the likelihood of sustained low-inflationary growth, writes Frank
McGurty in New York.
By the close the Dow was 5.06 ahead at 3,803.88, a new record. But the more
broadly based Standard & Poor's 500 was 0.43 easier at 467.12, reflecting a
nearly even split between advancing and declining issues. The American SE
composite edged 0.21 ahead to 479.00, while the Nasdaq composite was up 2.36
at 780.41.
Activity on the NYSE was hectic, pushed by a seasonal inflow of funds from
institutional investors. Some 368m shares were exchanged.
After ending at an all-time high the previous day, the market opened on a
positive note, buoyed by improved sentiment on inflation. Although stocks
moved in an opposite direction from bonds on Wednesday, investors were
pleased to see a rebound in the benchmark 30-year government issue, which
responded to favourable comments by Mr Robert Reich, the labor secretary.
Mr Reich said he expected that today's employment data would show lower
December job growth than the fixed-income markets had feared, suggesting
that concern over the pace of the economy's growth was overdone.
Retailing issues were among the most active, stimulated by the release of
December sales figures by the leading stores groups. Kmart dropped Dollars 1
3/4 to Dollars 19 1/4 on the heels of its reorganisation announcement. JC
Penney fell Dollars 1 to Dollars 51 5/8 in spite of a 10 per cent sales
gain. Woolworth shed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 24 3/4 and Wal-Mart Dollars
7/8 to Dollars 24 1/2 .
Fears of a price war among consumer electronics retailers pushed Best Buy
down Dollars 7 3/8 to Dollars 39 7/8 . Circuit City, the Big Board's most
active issue, plunged Dollars 4 5/8 to Dollars 17 1/2 .
Canada
The Toronto market set another record high, the third in a row, in continued
active trading. The TSE 300 index closed 24.3 stronger at 4,425.4 and rises
led declines by 448 to 343 after volume of 88.8m shares, the sixth heaviest
on record but below Wednesday's 95.7m total.
