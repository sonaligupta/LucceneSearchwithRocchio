FT  16 JAN 92 / International Company News: CrossLand ruling expected soon


   By ALAN FRIEDMAN


US BANK regulators are expected to decide shortly on the fate of CrossLand
Savings, the loss-making New York savings and loan that has been for sale
since signing a consent order with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
(FDIC) and Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) last July.
The leading bidders for the 49-branch CrossLand are Chase Manhattan and
Republic National Bank of New York.
Republic, which is 30 per cent owned by Mr Edmond Safra, the Swiss-based
Lebanese banker, yesterday officially confirmed for the first time that it
had submitted a bid for CrossLand's New York retail deposits to the FDIC.
CrossLand, an aggressive real estate lender in the New York area during the
late 1980s, suffered losses of Dollars 308m in the first nine months of
1991, and its asset bank was lowered from Dollars 11.7bn to Dollars 9.2bn.
Some Dollars 1.5bn of CrossLand's assets are non-performing.
Whether Chase or Republic are awarded CrossLand, the cost to the US
government of salvaging the bank is expected to be at least Dollars 1bn, and
possibly as high as Dollars 2bn.
Republic, meanwhile, yesterday said its net income for the fourth quarter of
1991 rose by 17.7 per cent to Dollars 58.2m. For the whole of 1991,
Republic's net profit was 13 per cent higher at Dollars 227.4m.
Republic's net interest income in 1991 totalled Dollars 581.2m, compared
with Dollars 457.3m in 1990, while loan-loss provisions were a low Dollars
62m last year. Non-performing assets rose only slightly year-on-year, from
Dollars 164.4m to Dollars 173.98m.
The bank has an unusually low lending profile, and its deposits are divided
among private banking (38 per cent), retail (37.5 per cent) and
institutional funds (24.5 per cent).
Republic's share price fell Dollars 1 1/4 at close of trade yesterday to
Dollars 46.
Bank of New York yesterday reported Dollars 66m fourth-quarter net income, a
slight improvement over the Dollars 65m earned a year ago. But a heavy loan
loss provision taken in the first quarter of last year resulted in a 60.4
per cent slump in full-year 1991 net income, to Dollars 122m, down from
Dollars 308m in 1990.
