FT  11 MAR 94 / International Company News: Grumman had talks with Northrop


   By MARTIN DICKSON


Grumman, which agreed on Monday to a Dollars 1.9bn cash bid from fellow
defence contractor Martin Marietta, had only recently broken off months of
merger discussions with Northrop, the California-based fighter aircraft
manufacturer, it has emerged.
Documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission showed that as
late as February 25 Northrop chief executive Mr Kent Kresa wrote to Grumman
saying it was prepared to submit a bid of not less than Dollars 50 a share,
if invited.
'We would also be prepared to consider an offer at a higher level, if
warranted, based on any additional information or analysis you may wish to
provide us,' the letter added.
However, on March 1 Grumman advised Northrop it was no longer interested in
pursuing talks and a week later agreed to a Dollars 55 a share cash offer
from Martin Marietta.
Northrop, in its negotiations, had said it preferred a transaction that
minimised the amount of cash involved.
