FT  17 JAN 92 / Money Markets: Liquidity squeezed


   By SIMON LONDON


UK short money rates were squeezed sharply higher yesterday as taxation
payments continued to drain funds from the market, writes Simon London.
The Bank of England forecast a Pounds 1.7bn shortage during the morning
session, later revised upwards to Pounds 1.8bn.
As with other recent liquidity shortages the main factors draining funds
from the market were maturing assistance totalling Pounds 832m and exchequer
transactions, mostly tax payments, of Pounds 790m.
However, while the Bank of England has provided early relief in recent days
to keep a lid on overnight money rates, yesterday there was no substantial
liquidity injection until the afternoon session. Facing a Pounds 2bn
liquidity squeeze again today, operators preferred to hold on to paper
rather than taking funds from the Bank.
Early assistance amounted to just Pounds 158m, comprising a small outright
purchase of band 1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent and a Pounds 128m purchase
of bills for resale to the market on February 3 at 10 7/16 per cent. Later
in the morning session the Bank bought a further tranche of band 1 bank and
treasury bills and added Pounds 31m for repurchase on February 3 on the same
terms.
Only in the afternoon did the Bank step in to relieve the squeeze in
institutional liquidity which saw overnight money rates rise to 30 per cent
for a short time.
Early afternoon assistance totalled Pounds 642m, again a mix of the outright
purchase of short maturity band 1 and band 2 bills and a further Pounds 96m
paper for repurchase.
Late assistance totalled Pounds 560m, bringing the total liquidity injection
for the day to nearly Pounds 1.5bn, still Pounds 300m shy of the forecast
shortage.
By the close, unsecured overnight money rate had traded back down to 10 3/4
 - 3/4 from 10 5/8 -  1/2 per cent on Wednesday.
The March short sterling contract on the London International Financial
Futures Exchange traded at around 89.69, closing at this level, unchanged
from Wednesday.
In Frankfurt, short rates eased for the second day running following the
Bundesbank's net liquidity injection of DM7.3bn on Wednesday.
Call money traded mostly at 9.45/50 per cent, from 9.45/55 per cent on
Wednesday and 9.55/60 per cent earlier in the week.
