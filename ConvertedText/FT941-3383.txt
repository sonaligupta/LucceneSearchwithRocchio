FT  16 MAR 94 / International Company News: Wolters Kluwer advances 23%

Wolters Kluwer, the Dutch publisher which is expanding rapidly overseas,
posted a 23 per cent increase in net profit last year, with a large part of
the rise due to a recent string of foreign acquisitions.
The company, which said yesterday that it expected to expand into five more
European countries this year, saw net profit rise to Fl 318m (Dollars 165m)
from Fl 258m in 1992. Turnover grew to Fl 2.62bn from Fl 2.36bn, while the
dividend is to be raised to Fl 1.52 from Fl 1.32.
The importance of recent foreign expansion is reflected by the fact that
more than half of last year's 21 per cent increase in operating profit was
generated by companies acquired during 1993.
Mr Mijndert Ververs, chairman, said Wolters Kluwer, which specialises in
professional, scientific and educational publishing, hoped to be able to
announce deals in the Czech Republic and Hungary within the next few months.
The total spent on acquisitions in 1994 is likely to be less than the Fl
700m spent on acquisitions and fixed-asset investment in 1993, he said. But
in keeping with last year, acquisitions in 1994 would be financed from
internal resources.
Wolters Kluwer's biggest acquisition last year was the takeover of Sweden's
Liber Group, which fits the company's strategy of expanding in countries
that are poised to become increasingly involved with the European Union.
This policy also lies behind its interest in eastern Europe.
The company expects to see a further increase in 1994 results, in line with
its goal of achieving an average 15 per cent increase in profit per fully
diluted share in the years until 1996. In 1996, it hopes to generate 70 per
cent of its operating profit abroad, compared with 62 per cent in 1993.
Turnover in 1996 is projected to increase to between Fl 3.3bn and Fl 3.5bn.
