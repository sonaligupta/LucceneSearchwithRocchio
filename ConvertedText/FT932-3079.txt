FT  16 JUN 93 / Call for levy to help meet City insurance cost rises


   By NORMA COHEN and RICHARD LAPPER


SIR FRANCIS McWilliams, the lord mayor of London, has called for a national
levy on businesses to help pay for the big increase in the cost for City
companies of insurance cover against terrorist acts.
'If the country as a whole wishes to continue to benefit from the City's
contribution to the national wealth, surely the country should share some of
the costs,' he said at the banquet at Guildhall.
Last month Pool Re, the government-backed reinsurance company formed to
provide terrorism insurance, announced that rates would be increased - with
rises of more than 300 per cent for some large City businesses.
Sir Francis criticised 'lack of consultation' over the rate increases.
Echoing the Confederation of British Industry and other business
organisations, the lord mayor said he favoured 'a more equitable way
forward'.
He said a steering group of leading City practitioners and specialists was
being formed to put forward proposals on improving security. Proposals under
consideration included increased use and co-ordination of surveillance
cameras, increased police powers and numbers, and restricting vehicle access
to certain areas.
