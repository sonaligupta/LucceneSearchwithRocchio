FT  09 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures And Options Trading


   By PETER JOHN


RUMOUR-PRONE derivative markets saw continuing volatility yesterday and
contributed to the early weakness in the underlying equity market, writes
Peter John.
The FT-SE futures March contract opened sharply lower and in early trade it
was at 2,490, representing a 32-point premium over cash. Although above
estimated fair value, the premium was well down on levels of recent days.
March came under further pressure with the first reports that US President
George Bush was ill and a belief that Wall Street would open at least 20
points off.
At one stage March was down 40 points, but then the buyers began to return.
Fears over Bush's illness eased, Wall Street opened only 10 off and then
rallied sharply, and a rumour swept through the market that the Bank of
England would hold a positive afternoon press conference. March climbed back
towards its previous close. It finished down 4 at 2,502 with 8,800 contracts
dealt and at a premium of 40 to cash.
On the LTOM, turnover was 23,130, slightly down on the previous day and BP
was the top equity option on 1,483 lots dealt. The biggest single trade was
a bearish buy of 700 Hanson February 200 puts at 7.
