FT  28 JUL 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Authors keyed up for DIY
publishing


   By THOMAS SLEMEN


Almost anyone can become a publisher of books, magazines, comics or
pamphlets - all they need is a desktop publishing system. This computer,
which can produce high quality text, graphics and even photographic images,
has spawned a host of small presses and publishers.
At the last count there were about 6,000 in the UK, while in the US it has
been estimated there will be around 200,000 small presses by the end of the
decade.
The small desktop-based presses are attracting discontented authors who have
been turned down by the principal publishing houses, and publishers who have
either been laid off, or are tired of working for big employers. Bizarre and
outrageous books on subjects ranging from corn circle spotting to successful
busking in Europe are now being printed and are proving popular with readers
who are bored with orthodox literature.
Desktop publishing systems enable many corners in traditional publishing to
be cut. Anyone who can use a 'mouse' can produce a limitless range of images
on the computer screen to create an eye-catching picture for a cover.
With a little capital and the expert advice of the Small Press Group it is
possible to set up a desktop-based small press.
A DTP-based press can earn a surprisingly high amount. Five thousand copies
of a popular book priced at Pounds 10 each will give a return of Pounds
50,000. Each book can be produced for as little as Pounds 1. Some presses
claim they can do it for less.
Most small presses offer their authors 7 to 10 per cent of any royalties,
although some offer a much lower percentage. A greater problem arises in
getting the books widely distributed and reviewed - economies of scale work
in favour of the larger houses. This makes it advisable to stick to
specialised subjects. For further information contact: The Small Press
