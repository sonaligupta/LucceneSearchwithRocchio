FT  25 AUG 92 / People: Ex-Mercury star rising at Morgan


Nicola Horlick, 31, (right) hired a year ago by Morgan Grenfell to beef up
its UK specialist pension fund management performance, has been promoted to
managing director of Morgan Grenfell Investment Management (MGIM), in charge
of the overall UK pension fund business. She replaces 46-year-old Neil
Dunford (left), who is moved to the new position of MGIM deputy chairman.
Morgan Grenfell's UK pension side has long trailed behind its highly
successful international investment management. 'The good people have always
wanted to go into international' observes Horlick, who was recruited from
Mercury Asset Management, where she had been in charge of the 'specialist'
team and Pounds 6.5bn of funds. Until now looking after the UK 'specialist',
or performance, side at Morgan (involving some Pounds 600m in client funds)
she now assumes responsibility for the standard 'balanced' funds as well,
and accounts worth a total of Pounds 5.3bn. 'I am here to get the balanced
side really going'.
Keith Percy, boss of Morgan Grenfell Asset Management (encompassing both
international and UK fund management, of some Pounds 17bn) and chairman of
MGIM, claims 'the total UK performance is up a quartile since I joined two
years ago, but equity selection in the 'balanced' funds has still been
disappointing'. Looking for a more 'cohesive' management structure, he says
there had been 'three of four senior people below Dunford, and I felt one of
them should have the final say on investment matters.'
Horlick, a law graduate who came to the City by way of a year selling animal
feeds for her father's nascent business, has not looked back since joining
MAM - where 'she had a fantastic track record ' according to Percy. Mercury
has recently lost several people, including Leonard Licht, her former boss,
who went to the small fund management operation Jupiter Tyndall.
Countering the impression that Dunford - whose background is Schroders and
Scottish Widows - has been side-lined, Percy says he only did not give
Dunford the MGIM chairmanship because he wanted to avoid the industry
concluding he, Percy, was distancing himself from the UK business.

Spring Ram Corporation, the bathrooms and kitchens group, has recruited
three subsidiary directors from rival companies.
As the production director of Fordham Bathrooms, Alex Gemmell, 52, will
supervise the commissioning of a 550,000 sq ft bathroom factory at Bradford.
Gemmell was previously a production director with Armitage Shanks, part of
Blue Circle Industries.
The factory building is due to start this autumn and to be completed 18
months later. It will absorb the bulk of the Pounds 45m capital spending
that Spring Ram has scheduled for next year.
Fordham Bathrooms came into Spring Ram last year via an acquisition from
Hepworth, the building materials group. Bill Rooney, Spring Ram chairman,
said Fordham's main thrust would be to sell into the builders' merchant
sector of the bathrooms market.
Robin Trotter, 39, has been recruited from Carron Phoenix, the sink
subsidiary of the Swiss company Franke Holdings, to become managing director
of Astracast, Spring Ram's asterite sink company. He fills a vacancy created
by the recent appointment of Ron Farr to the main board.
Noel Riley, also 39, has been appointed sales and marketing director of
Streamline, which sells bathrooms, tiles and other accessories to DIY retail
