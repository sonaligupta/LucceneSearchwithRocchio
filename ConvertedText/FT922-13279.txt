FT  13 APR 92 / UK Company News: Harland and Wolff makes Pounds 4m
provisions


HARLAND AND Wolff, the Belfast shipbuilder, made a profit of Pounds 2.11m in
1991, after Pounds 3.96m exceptional provisions.
Mr John Parker, chairman and chief executive, said Pounds 2.5m was
restructuring costs to cover redundancies, as the shipping side reshapes
during 1992 from a mixed naval and merchant builder to a series build
merchant operation.
There were also one time provisions in Trassey Shipping for costs which were
previously expected to be incurred over four years as the Knock Ardy traded.
The exceptionals were on top of a Pounds 4.4m operating loss, but the
aggregate deficit was offset by interest received of Pounds 11m.
A redemption premium of Pounds 12m paid by the DED on the termination of its
obligations under the recourse agreement pushed net profit up to Pounds
12.6m. Earnings per share were 3.8p and the final dividend is 2p for a total
of 5.5p.
The extended programme on the AOR vessel added substantially to costs in the
protective coatings and technical services companies as they both operate on
fixed price contracts. The ship repair side and outfit service company had
positive results. Electrical services results were unsatisfactory.
In the 18 months to December 31 1990 the group made a pre-tax profit of
Pounds 11.7m.
