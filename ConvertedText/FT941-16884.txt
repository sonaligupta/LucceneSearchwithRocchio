FT  07 JAN 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): In touch by fax while on the
move


   By DELLA BRADSHAW


Sending a fax message or receiving electronic mail while outside the office
may be simplified by the EO 440, a portable tablet measuring only 10in by
7in.
The tablet stores outgoing messages until the machine is plugged into a
mobile phone or standard phone socket, when the messages are sent. Incoming
messages are held centrally by AT&T's Easylink electronic mail service until
the machine is plugged into the telephone network, when they are delivered.
The EO 440, which is sold in the UK by Olivetti, has a display which
recognises hand-writing and a stylus so that messages or faxes can be
written or annotated. The tablet can also run standard software packages.
Olivetti: UK, 081 785 6666.
