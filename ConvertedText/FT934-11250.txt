FT  02 NOV 93 / Lively week for libraries


TO MARK National Library Week, the British Library's reading room at the
British Museum was opened to the public yesterday for the first time since
it was built in 1857.
The library, founded in 1753, holds 10m books. They will soon transfer to
the new British Library on Euston Road in north London, and the vacated room
will be used for British Museum collections.
National Library Week, organised by the Library Association, a
government-backed charity, involves events around the country. Dickens
characters have abseiled on the front of Newcastle upon Tyne Central
Library. Birmingham Central Library, the biggest public library in Europe,
will open all night, with music and drama.
