   NEW YORK


UPJOHN, the US drugs company, yesterday said the Spanish government had
suspended sales of the high-dose form of its Halcion sleeping pill, although
the lower dosage tablets will remain on the market, writes Karen Zagor in
New York.
The move by the Ministry of Health follows a similar decision by France in
December. In the UK, Halcion sales were suspended in October.
