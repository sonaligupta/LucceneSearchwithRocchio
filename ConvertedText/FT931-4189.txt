FT  12 MAR 93 / Brazil braced for new shot at economic goal: A report on the
prospects for the new finance minister, beset by inflation


   By CHRISTINA LAMB


   BRASLIA


ALL Brazilians, they say, have their own dream team to play in the national
soccer side - and their own solution for combating inflation, now at an
annual 1,500 per cent.
Some seven team managers and eight finance ministers have had their chance
to try their hand with various shock plans and strategies in the past eight
years, but neither Brazil's football nor its economy has prospered. Another
change at the top of the Finance Ministry last week prompted fears that a
further shock plan was on its way, despite the past failure of such
measures.
All the signs are there. Inflation is nearing 30 per cent a month, at which
point desperate governments of the past have slapped on price freezes and
seized assets. Recession is in its fourth year and the government is yet to
finalise the budget this year. President Itamar Franco is under increasing
pressure to act.
His political allies, though, have been quick to warn against the
longer-term consequences of shock 'heterodox' measures such as a price and
wage freeze. 'If we've learnt anything in the past few years it is that
magic solutions don't work,' says Mr Tasso Jereissati, leader of the Social
Democrat party (PSDB) who met the president on Tuesday. 'The real problem to
tackle is public finances.'
For the moment, the pendulum seems to have swung away from heterodox
measures in favour of serious fiscal adjustment. Mr Eliseu Resende, the new
finance minister, ruled out shock plans in his first public pronouncement
this week.
What he does intend to do is not yet clear. As the third finance minister in
just five months and a minister under military regimes, Mr Resende faces a
serious public credibility problem. But Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso,
foreign minister and one of Mr Franco's closest advisers, says the situation
is better than it looks.
He points out that exports are booming, a new law deregulating Brazil's
backward port system has been passed and on Wednesday night the Senate
approved a new tax to raise Dollars 600m per month to help the government
balance its books. The government's economics team has also developed a
serious programme of fiscal discipline which it is now trying to convince
the president to adopt.
Mr Fernando Antoni Hadba, aide to the chief economic policy maker, explains:
'All past shock plans tackled the effects of inflation such as prices rather
than the causes.' The new plan lays the main blame on the government
domestic debt of Dollars 132bn, of which Dollars 36bn is short-term 28-day
Treasury bills in the hands of the public and the rest held by the central
bank.
Though larger than Brazil's foreign debt, the domestic debt is not
unmanageable for an economy with a gross domestic product of Dollars 400bn.
The problem is how it is financed - through issuing more short-term high
interest rate bonds - and the narrowness of the monetary base of just 1 per
cent of GDP. The current situation, where Treasury debt is being rolled over
at the rate of one monetary base per week, is highly unstable.
The current idea is to separate the Treasury and the central bank, forcing
the former to adjust in what Mr Hadba calls 'an institutional shock'.
Once independent and freed from bailing out the Treasury, the central bank
could then preset monetary targets. To cut its operational deficit to zero
the Treasury would then have to renegotiate debts such as Dollars 50bn owed
by states and municipalities, Dollars 20bn owed to the electrical sector and
an enormous debt to the social security and pension funds.
To raise funds to repay some of short-term debt, the ministry would
accelerate privatisation, suspended since December, and sell off some big
names such as Vale do Rio Doce, the world-class state mining company which
it estimates could raise Dollars 8bn-Dollars 10bn.
Once the arch-enemy of privatisation, Mr Franco has apparently been won
over, shocked by the inefficiency and privileges of the state sector which
this year will cost the government some Dollars 19bn.
It is also hoped to lengthen the maturity of Treasury debt by offering a
dollar or inflation-linked return with interest guaranteed by foreign
reserves. The consequent reduction in government needs to raise money would
enable a lowering of interest rates from the current real 20-30 per cent.
Prices would be kept under control through a strengthened anti-trust law. A
government mission is currently in the US studying this.
The policy team estimates that this strategy will reduce inflation to an
'acceptable level' of an annual 15-20 per cent within a year. 'It is not an
overnight solution,' says Mr Hadba, 'but for a country which has been in
crisis for 10 years, it is not long.'
The plan sounds plausible. But even its architects, appointed by the
previous minister, do not know if they will still be in their jobs next
week. And although the new minister has approved much of the plan, he must
then persuade Mr Franco who has pledged that all measures must receive
congressional approval - a Herculean task in a country with 18 political
parties.
Although the threat of a return to the shock plan may have receded, nobody
is ruling it out. With just 22 months left in office, Mr Franco says he
wants quick results. He could easily change his mind again.
