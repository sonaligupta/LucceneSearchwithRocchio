FT  17 JAN 92 / International Company News: Digital Equipment's Dollars 130m
loss heavier than market expected

   SAN FRANCISCO


DIGITAL Equipment, the computer manufacturer, has incurred a
larger-than-expected second-quarter loss and is to accelerate plans to
consolidate operations and cut its workforce.
Net losses for the quarter were Dollars 138m, or Dollars 1.11 a share,
against net income of Dollars 111m, or 92 cents, in last year's second
quarter.
Analysts had expected losses of between 30 cents and 60 cents a share.
Revenues for the quarter rose slightly to Dollars 3.48bn, from Dollars
3.35bn a year ago.
Digital's stock plunged on the results to close at Dollars 54 3/4 , down
from Dollars 59 overnight.
'In a competitive world where most customers are cutting back on capital
expenditures, we did not see any growth in product sales and we had to
adjust pricing,' said Mr Kenneth Olsen, Digital president.
Equipment sales were flat, although the software and services business
continued to grow, he said.
Digital had forecast an operating loss for the quarter, saying last month
that recessions in the US and Europe had hit sales of its highest
performance computers particularly hard.
For the fiscal year ended last June, Digital reported its first annual loss
of Dollars 617m after taking heavy restructuring charges to cover the cost
of thousands of layoffs.
Digital is to accelerate efforts to restore profitability, through
cost-containment measures and by seeking new opportunities for revenue
growth by expanding markets and distribution channels, said Mr Smith.
Digital had announced plans to cut its workforce by 10,000 this year, but
may now make deeper cuts. The company employs about 119,500 people
worldwide.
For the half-year, the net loss was Dollars 109.7m, or 88 cents, against net
income of Dollars 137.3m, or Dollars 1.12, a year earlier. Revenues were
Dollars 6.8bn against Dollars 6.4bn.
