Car theft, described as a 'multi million pound industry', is investigated by
Public Eye (8.00 BBC2). It seems that the number of vehicles now being
stolen by professional thieves (as distinct, presumably, from being 'taken
and driven away' by primary school children as in our area of London) is
150,000 a year, and few are ever seen again by their owners.
In the third episode of Fay Weldon's Growing Rich (9.00 ITV) Annie learns
what life is really like on a New Zealand sheep farm; Laura, now the mother
of two, finds herself in competition with her father's new young wife; and
Carmen, having agreed to sup with the devil, discovers that she needs a long
 .dress. He helps her fill it in spectacular fashion by enlarging her bust
and decreasing her waist.
With the Otto Dix exhibition opening at the Tate Gallery in London today,
Arena is devoted to the painter who held both East and West German
passports, yet was not greatly admired on either side of the Berlin Wall.
Now, 23 years after his death, his work, which seems to reflect the spirit
of the pre-war Berlin nightclubs, is admired more and more (9.30 BBC2).
