FT  15 DEC 94 / International Company News: Enichem sells stake in
microfibres unit

   MILAN


Enichem, the Italian state-controlled chemicals group, has taken a further
step towards the reduction of its looming debt by agreeing to sell its
majority stake in Alcantara, a microfibres manufacturer, to Toray, the
quoted Japanese chemicals and fibres company, writes Andrew Hill in Milan.
Enichem did not release financial details of the sale yesterday, but it is
understood that the disposal of the 51 per cent stake in Alcantara should
realise some L200bn (Dollars 122m).
Earlier this year, the partial flotation of EVC, Enichem's plastics joint
venture with ICI of the UK, helped reduce debt by some L500bn.
With the help of a L3,000bn capital injection from ENI, its state-owned
parent company, Enichem hopes to halve debt by the end of the year to
L4,500bn from L9,000bn a year earlier.
