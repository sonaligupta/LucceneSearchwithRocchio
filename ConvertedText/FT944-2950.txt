FT  15 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Stirling ahead to Pounds 2.22m in depressed
markets


   By PETER PEARSE


Stirling Group, the clothing manufacturer, reported pre-tax profits of
Pounds 2.22m for the six months to September 30, against Pounds 223,000
after losses of Pounds 926,000 from discontinued operations, writes Peter
Pearse.
The shares closed down 3p at 54p. Mr Steven Bentwood, chief executive, saw
the fall against a background of a depressed textile sector as well as a
depressed retail sector.
Continuing activities saw operating profits advance 15 per cent to Pounds
2.02m (Pounds 1.76m) on turnover up 6 per cent at Pounds 38m (Pounds 35.8m).
The profits pleased Mr Bentwood but he would have preferred the turnover to
have risen 8 per cent.
The group announced in April it was to withdraw from its import business. In
the half it accounted for turnover of Pounds 4.25m (Pounds 10.9m) and
operating losses of Pounds 418,000 (Pounds 753,000). Last time's figures
also included contributions from the brand division sold to its management
in December 1993.
Stirling made provisions of Pounds 1.8m for the imports closure, of which
only Pounds 1.59m was required.
The interim dividend is lifted 9 per cent to 0.6p, payable from earnings per
share of 1.7p (losses 0.06p).
