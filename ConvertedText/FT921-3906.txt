FT  12 MAR 92 / Observer: Backlash


A bit of a sandstorm has been stirred up by Observer's claim that a camel
with no humps is called Humphrey. That's the name for a camel with three
humps, snorts reader Peter Tray, the no-humped variety being obviously a
horse designed by a committee.
R S Bristowe of Sheffield disagrees. In his book, the name for a
three-humped camel is Triumph.
