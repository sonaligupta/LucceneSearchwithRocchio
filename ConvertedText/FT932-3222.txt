FT  15 JUN 93 / International Company News: Ivax agrees to takeover


   By KAREN ZAGOR


   NEW YORK


IVAX, a rapidly-expanding US holding company formed from the merger of three
pharmaceutical and chemicals companies, yesterday agreed to buy Johnson
Products in a deal valued between Dollars 61m and Dollars 73m.
On Wall Street, shares in Johnson Products, a health care products group,
jumped Dollars 5 5/8 to Dollars 24 5/8 , while Ivax edged Dollars  1/8
higher to Dollars 25 1/4 after a delayed opening.
The planned deal is subject to a number of conditions, including regulatory
and shareholder approval and confirmation that the transaction qualifies for
accounting treatment as a pooling of interests.
Johnson Products' majority shareholder has agreed to vote for the takeover
unless the company's board accepts or recommends a better offer before July
29.
In Europe, Ivax has expanded rapidly. Efforts to extend its marketing
network and product range includes the Pounds 22m (Dollars 33.8m)
acquisition of Waverly Pharmaceutical, a privately-owned UK contract
manufacturing group, and the purchase of Harris Pharmaceuticals, a generics
maker.
