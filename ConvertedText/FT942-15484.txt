FT  15 APR 94 / Sweden swinging to the left

Support for Sweden's opposition Social Democrats has risen to 50.5 per cent
against 39.0 per cent for parties in the centre-right government, according
to an opinion poll yesterday. The poll suggests the party is benefiting from
turmoil in New Democracy, the populist party which holds the balance of
power, where support has crumbled to 2.5 per cent from 4.5 per cent in a
month. A Social Democrat victory in September's general election is viewed
as strengthening chances of a 'yes' vote in the Swedish referendum on EU
membership on November 13.
