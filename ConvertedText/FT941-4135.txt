FT  12 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Design side spending limits Abbott Mead to
Pounds 4.75m


   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent


Abbott Mead Vickers, the advertising group, yesterday reported a slight
increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 4.75m for the year to December 31
against Pounds 4.72m in 1992.
The figure, which disappointed analysts, was held back by investment in the
group's design subsidiary, McBain Noel-Johnson, where profits fell from
Pounds 2.1m to Pounds 1m. Excluding this expenditure, AMV said group
operating profit was up 26 per cent, on an underlying basis.
The shares closed down 22p at 708p.
Group turnover increased by almost 20 per cent to Pounds 201.2m (Pounds
167.9m).
Earnings per share were static at 18.7p but confidence about prospects for
1994 means the board is recommending a final dividend of 7.3p making a total
of 10.5p, a 12.9 per cent increase.
AMV had a record year for new business wins, which totalled Pounds 70m of
billings on an annualised basis. Gains included Gossard, Ever Ready,
Tambrands, Gillette and British Gas.
Mr David Abbott, chairman, said 1994 had started exceptionally well, with
new business totalling over Pounds 75m on an annualised basis.
A British Telecommunications contract, worth Pounds 50m in annual billings,
is described by AMV as the 'largest single new business win in the history
of British advertising'. The group is currently pitching for business which
would be worth Pounds 76m in billings.
Mr Peter Mead, chief executive, said there were 'real signs of growth' in
client spending. 'I don't see any requirement to be gloomy any more,' he
said.
Investment in the development of electronic systems which will allow images
and words for advertising campaigns to be manipulated on a computer network
by clients in their own offices, is already yielding new business, including
a three-year, fixed-fee contract with Delta Airlines.
