FT  11 APR 94 / Company News (This Week): Burmah weathers German trough -
Other companies


Burmah Castrol, the lubricants, chemicals and fuels group, is expected to
report 1993 pre-tax profits of about Pounds 186m today, up from Pounds
179.6m.
Trading has been tough in Germany, which accounts for about 20 per cent of
group business, but recession in Europe should have been counterbalanced by
more favourable conditions elsewhere. Following an enhanced scrip dividend
at the interim stage, analysts think the final dividend could rise by more
than 10 per cent.
