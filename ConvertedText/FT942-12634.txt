FT  28 APR 94 / International Company News: BCE ahead 15% in first quarter

Rising demand for value-added telephone services helped BCE, the Canadian
telecommunications holding company, boost first-quarter earnings by 14 per
cent.
But BCE, Canada's biggest private-sector company, warned yesterday that
regulatory barriers in Canada could slow the convergence of telephone,
television and computer technologies which has become a high priority of its
corporate strategy.
'Investors are increasingly nervous about (the policy and regulatory)
environment,' Mr Red Wilson, chief executive, told the annual meeting in
Toronto. 'They perceive the regulatory framework as being uncertain, the
direction of government policy as being unclear. We need to know which
markets will be open to us as investors in Canada.'
First-quarter earnings rose to CDollars 251m (USDollars 181.8m) or 74 cents
a share, from CDollars 221m, or 66 cents, a year earlier. Revenues were
CDollars 5bn against CDollars 4.73bn.
The bulk of the earnings came from Canadian telecommunications, mainly Bell
Canada, the country's biggest phone company. Bell contributed CDollars 180m
to consolidated earnings, up from CDollars 132m last year. The performance
reflects higher sales of a growing array of optional phone services, growth
of network access services, and payments from long-distance competitors for
access to local networks.
BCE's other interests include a 53 per cent stake in Northern Telecom, the
telephone equipment maker; 20 per cent of Mercury, the UK telephone company;
and 30 per cent of Jones Intercable, a US-based cable-TV operator.
Northern Telecom contributed CDollars 63m of BCE's first-quarter earnings,
up from CDollars 47m. But most of the 1994 contribution came from a CDollars
51m gain from the sale of a plant in Saskatchewan.
Mr Wilson said while recent results have been disappointing, BCE has firmly
positioned itself in the telecoms business by selling all non-telecom
assets. After costly diversification in the early 1980s, Mr Wilson pledged
that telecoms is 'the only business that we intend to pursue'.
