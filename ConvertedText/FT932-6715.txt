FT  27 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Government to announce committee of
privy council


   By DAVID OWEN


THE government plans within days to announce proposals to set up a committee
of privy councillors to monitor the security services, a Labour MP said
yesterday, writes David Owen. Mr Donald Anderson, the MP for Swansea East,
made the claim while expressing concern the announcement might come during
the Whitsun recess. He was supported by Mr David Winnick, the Labour MP for
Walsall North, who said confining membership of such a body to privy
councillors would be 'a form of apartheid'. Cabinet ministers agreed earlier
this month to proceed with legislation to put MI6, the overseas security
service, on a statutory basis in the next session of parliament. However, it
is understood that plans to increase the accountability to parliament of the
security services have not yet gone to cabinet.
