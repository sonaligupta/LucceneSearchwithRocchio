FT  26 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Building societies' tax move
resisted


   By EMMA TUCKER


THE GOVERNMENT yesterday pressed ahead with plans to defy attempts by Leeds
Building and other building societies to recover through the courts what
they claims is overpaid tax.
During discussions in the committee stage of the finance bill, Mr Stephen
Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, said the government was unable
to stand by in the face of current court proceedings when the amounts in
question were so high.
The societies say they were taxed twice during the introduction of
composite-rate tax in the late 1980s and are owed Pounds 57m. The
government, instead, contends that the exchequer stands to lose up to Pounds
15bn of tax should the proceedings succeed.
Last year's Finance Bill contained retrospective legislation preventing the
Leeds and other societies from following in the footsteps of the Woolwich,
which had won a similar action. This year's retrospective legislation might
close the door for good on action in the UK courts.
Mr Geoffrey Hoon, the Labour MP for Ashfield, said: 'What is plainly wrong
with this clause is that it seeks to deal retrospectively with a situation
that was all of the government's making.'
MPs rejected an opposition amendment to allow the money to be recovered and
then invested in mortgage rescue schemes.
