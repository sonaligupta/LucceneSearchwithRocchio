FT  01 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Buzzacott acts to meet charity rules


   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent


Buzzacott Investment Management, a firm of chartered accountants which also
manages funds for charities, has turned over Pounds 60m of its clients'
monies to Mercury Asset Management, largely in response to new rules on
charity investment.
Mr Brian Regan, a senior partner of Buzzacott, said: 'This is a natural
development in view of the new audit requirements for charities which are
expected to come into force towards the end of 1995.
Buzzacott said it would continue to act as financial adviser for its
auditing clients and continue its performance monitoring function of client
portfolios.
From next year, auditors to charities face tougher requirements under the
Charities Act of 1993. A further statement of recommended practice from the
Accounting Standards Board says that those who audit the investment
portfolio of a charity should not also be responsible for making investment
decisions.
