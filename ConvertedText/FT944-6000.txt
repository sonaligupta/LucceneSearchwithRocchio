FT  01 DEC 94 / Rover to build engineering and design centre


   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent


Rover, the leading UK vehicle maker, is to invest Pounds 25m to build a new
design and engineering centre at Gaydon, Warwickshire.
From 1997 the Gaydon site will become Rover's main engineering centre and
the location for all its new vehicle design and development operations with
a workforce of close to 2,000.
The 900-acre former RAF airfield was acquired by Rover in 1979. It already
includes Rover's main vehicle testing facilities with 36 miles of proving
roads and test track.
The new design and engineering centre at Gaydon will house 700 to 1,000
people, most of whom will be transferred from the vehicle design site at
Canley, Coventry, which is being redeveloped as a commercial and retail
park.
Rover has already developed a full range of vehicle test facilities at
Gaydon including climatic wind tunnels.
Rover, which has an overall engineering staff of about 2,500, said it had 'a
complete capability' to design and develop both cars and four-wheel-drive
vehicles in the UK, which was unaffected by the group's takeover by BMW of
Germany.
Rover said the combination of vehicle development testing with its product
design and development operations at one site would help shorten development
lead-times and reduce costs.
Rover is engaged in a five-year, Pounds 1.5bn investment programme for the
development of new models, which began this autumn with the launch of a new
generation Range Rover.
The renewal and development of its car operations includes the launch next
year of replacements for the existing Rover 200/400 range as well as the
revival of the MG sports car marque.
It is working on the development of a new range of smaller Land Rover
four-wheel-drive vehicles for launch in the late 1990s, which will be
positioned below its Range Rover and Discovery ranges.
