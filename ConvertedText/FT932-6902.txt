FT  26 MAY 93 / International Company News: Seiko profit plunges but share
price firms

SEIKO, the leading Japanese watch and clock maker, blamed weak domestic
demand and global recession for a 61.8 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to
Y1.3bn (Dollars 11.76m) for the year to March, its second consecutive fall.
The company said the shift in Japanese consumption to lower-priced products
amid the prolonged economic downturn and diminishing exports had put
pressure on earnings.
Net profits fell 23.8 per cent to Y1.1bn and sales by 10.2 per cent to
Y268.2bn. Exports tumbled by 7.4 per cent.
In spite of the sharp plunge in pre-tax profits, Seiko's shares rose Y20 to
Y1,300 on the Tokyo stock exchange yesterday. Analysts said investors had
already discounted the slide and Seiko's shares were likely to excite buying
interest due to its forecast of pre-tax profits soaring 81.8 per cent to
Y2.5bn in the current financial year.
The company predicts sales will move 2.5 per cent higher to Y275bn in tandem
with an improving world economy.
