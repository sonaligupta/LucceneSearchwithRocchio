FT  12 MAR 93 / People: ITV Network Centre


Dick Emery was yesterday appointed director, market strategy, at the ITV
Network Centre, the body responsible for commissioning more than Pounds 500m
worth of ITV programmes a year.
Emery moves from ITN where he was commercial director. He had been seen as a
possible replacement for Bob Phillis, the ITN chief executive, who is moving
to the BBC as deputy director general.
A former sales director of Central Independent Television, Emery will be
responsible at the ITV Network for exploiting research and marketing
information to develop the network schedule, which has just announced the
commissioning of 18 drama productions for the autumn.
