FT  23 NOV 92 / Taxation of child benefit ruled out


   By ALISON SMITH


MR PETER LILLEY, social security secretary, yesterday in effect ruled out
taxing child benefit to make future savings in the social security budget.
But Mr Lilley signalled that in considering scope for savings the government
would look at benefits where spending was rising sharply without being
related to the recession.
Mr Lilley told the BBC's 'On the Record' that while the basic retirement
pension - the only universal entitlement apart from child benefit - was
taxable, he saw formidable difficulties both practically and in principle in
taxing child benefit. The benefit is paid direct to the mother, and taxing
it on the basis of the father's income as well would fly in the face of the
independent taxation of women.
Mr Lilley said that his first priority had to be ways of saving money that
did not impinge on benefits, such as cracking down on fraud. But some
benefits themselves also required attention, he said.
'You have to look at benefits which are growing rapidly, and ask yourself if
that growth is accounted for just by the recession or some other factors. We
looked at, for example, invalidity benefit - one of the fastest growing and
largest benefits - and we thought it right to tighten up on the medical
procedures so that we made more efficient use of our resources to ensure it
isn't going to people who aren't entitled to it.'
