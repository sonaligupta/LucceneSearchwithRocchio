FT  15 NOV 93 / Arafat urged to curb militants


   By DAVID HOROVITZ


   JERUSALEM


Ministers in Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's Israeli government yesterday
called on PLO leader Yassir Arafat to do more to control Palestinian
militants who are attacking Israeli targets in the occupied territories,
David Horovitz reports from Jerusalem. Mr Arafat has condemned the killing
last month of a Jewish settler, Haim Mizrahi, allegedly by five activists
from his own Fatah faction of the PLO.
There were also reports last night that Mr Arafat and Mr Rabin are to hold a
second summit in Cairo next month.
