FT  29 JAN 92 / World Trade News: 'Little benefit' in FTAs for Latin America
 -A look at a report querying the gains in more open access to US markets


   By STEPHEN FIDLER


THE benefits to most Latin American countries of free trade pacts with the
US are likely to be small, according to a new World Bank study*.
The report questions some gains expected by the many Latin governments
seeking freer trade with the US. Some 16 Latin American governments, led by
Mexico, have signed framework pacts with the US as a first sign of their
intent to seek free trade accords. There are parallel efforts to seek free
trade accords among Latin countries themselves.
Except Brazil or Mexico, most countries stand to gain less from the free
trade agreements (FTAs) than does the US, the report finds. It suggests free
trade pacts within Latin America should be a higher priority than with the
US for most countries, because 'Latin American countries probably stand to
gain significant long-term export benefits from reduced trade barriers among
themselves.
'The main incentive for the Latin American countries to form FTAs with the
US may be to attract investment or halt the spread of new trade
restrictions,' says the paper, written by two World Bank economists, Mr
Refik Erzan and Mr Alexander Yeats.
It sees dangers for Latin America as a whole in haphazard free trade
negotiations with the US, because such FTAs would give advantages to US
exporters over exporters from other Latin countries.
'It is possible that a series of FTAs could be negotiated that would provide
the US with preferences that convey a major competitive advantage over other
countries in the region,' it says. 'As a result, Latin American countries
may be better off joining a customs union rather than a free trade
arrangement.' A customs union involves members setting up a common outside
tariff which does not exist in an FTA.
The study concludes that 'a US FTA with Mexico would greatly influence
Mexico's trade with other countries, even if those countries also have an
FTA with the US.' Most of this impact would be on exports from countries
outside Latin America: an exclusive US-Mexico FTA would displace about
Dollars 440m (Pounds 243m) of other countries' exports, but only Dollars 28m
of these would be from Latin America. Gains to Mexican exports, based on
1986 figures, would be Dollars 1.6bn.
Overall, full FTA preferences with the US would raise Latin American exports
8-9 per cent. But the expansion of Mexico's exports would exceed those for
all other countries combined and 'Mexico plus Brazil together account for
almost 90 per cent of the total gains.'
The report suggests a modest impact because of the small percentage of Latin
American exports to the US affected both by an important tariff of greater
than 5 per cent and a non-tariff barrier.
Only 1.7 per cent of Chile's exports are affected by both, 8.5 per cent of
Mexico's, 10.7 per cent of Argentina's, 12.5 per cent of Brazil's, 0.7 per
cent of Venezuela's and 10.4 per cent of Colombia's, against 55.1 per cent
of South Korea's exports, 56.4 per cent of Hong Kong's and 21.4 per cent of
Singapore's
The authors make no formal study of the potential for the expansion of US
exports, but their comparisons suggest 'US trade gains, particularly for
highly-protected transport and machinery products, are likely to be
considerably greater than those for Latin America in the US market'.
This is because during the study period, average level of tariff protection
is higher than in the US. The report makes no assessment of recent
significant tariff cuts introduced over the past 12 months by various Latin
American governments.
Trade gains for Latin America would be even more limited if no parallel
action is taken to remove US non-tariff barriers, which are particularly
important for countries such as Uruguay, which has a heavy concentration of
textile and clothing exports.
But if textile quotas for other countries continue (under the so-called
Multi-Fibre Arrangement, MFA) and they are lifted for Latin American
countries under FTAs, there is a large potential for Latin America to
replace far eastern and other suppliers as exporters to the US. However, as
the report suggests, a phase-out of the MFA as part of the current Uruguay
Round trade talks and the likely transitional arrangements for textiles in
any conceivable FTA with the US would probably limit the impact.
The report will be seen as having two main limitations. It addresses only
the direct trade implications of FTAs and the economic model used by the
economists is limited, for example in its ability to assess the impact of
non-tariff barriers. Further, some governments are already stressing the
importance of non-trade gains of FTAs. The Mexican administration, for
example, sees an accord providing a spur to investment flows and making it
harder to reverse its economic reform programme.
