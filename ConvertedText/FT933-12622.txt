FT  23 JUL 93 / Insurers spared OFT action


THE OFFICE of Fair Trading has decided not to act against insurance
companies over their practice of recommending repairers and glass fitters to
motorists covered by their policies. The OFT has called, however, for
consumers to be made more aware of their rights.
Insurance companies recommend repair companies which may work on damaged
cars without further authorisation. Body shops and glass fitters which are
not participants have complained that consumers might assume they were
required to employ a recommended repairer. The OFT concluded insurers were
encouraging claimants to employ recommended companies.
