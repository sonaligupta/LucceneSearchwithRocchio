FT  23 APR 93 / Observer: Hard of hearing


London Forum, the private-sector talking shop set up by GrandMet chairman
Sir Allen Sheppard to promote London overseas, seems to have a bit of a
communications problem.
More than two months after London's business leaders held their first
meeting on a battleship moored opposite the Tower of London, it is still
impossible to get the telephone numbers of London Forum, and its little
sister, London First, by ringing directory inquiries. It seems to confirm
Observer's worst fears that the members of this odd outfit are more
interested in talking than listening.
