FT  13 APR 94 / Korean monks still in dispute


   By JOHN BURTON


   SEOUL


The South Korean government said yesterday that it would not intervene to
settle a violent dispute affecting the country's main Buddhist sect.
Hundreds of riot police occupied the temple headquarters of the Chogye order
for a second day to prevent a new bout of fighting between conservative and
reformist monks.
Clashes at the temple in central Seoul on Sunday night left 38 people
injured and resulted in the arrest of 140 monks after the reformers tried to
storm the order's administration building.
The affair has placed the government of President Kim Young Sam in an
awkward position because of allegations that the conservative Chogye order
leadership diverted Dollars 1m (Pounds 600m) in religious donations to help
finance Mr Kim's 1992 presidential election campaign.
The government also fears alienating the Chogye order, which wields
considerable influence among voters. 'We're frankly surprised that what
appeared to be a relatively minor dispute has escalated so quickly,' said
one presidential aide.
The reformist monks are trying to turn the issue into an anti-government
campaign, claiming that the use of the riot police represented official
support for the Rev Suh Eui Hyun, the order's conservative administrative
head. The dispute stems from the reformist monks' opposition to Rev Suh's
re-election last week for a third consecutive term.
The government said the riot police were deployed to end the violence and
they would be withdrawn from the Chogye temple if the two factions agreed to
a truce. The opposition Democratic party has also criticised the government
for 'its one-sided support of Rev Suh's conservative forces'.
