FT  17 JAN 92 / Unemployment rises to 9%


   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff


THE UNEMPLOYMENT rate rose to a four-year high of 9 per cent in December
from 8.8 per cent the previous month.
Last month's increase of 31,100 in the seasonally adjusted figure - the
twenty-first successive monthly increase - took the total number of
unemployed to 2.55m, a peak last reached in December 1987. The total rise in
unemployment last year was 704,000.
December's increase followed a revised rise of 40,800 in November, and
brought the average rise in unemployment over the past six months to 41,000.
In the six months to June last year the average monthly rise was 76,300.
Mr Michael Howard, employment secretary, said the figures showed that the
rate of increase in unemployment had eased. 'December's rise in seasonally
adjusted unemployment is, with just one exception, the smallest for 15
months,' he said. He also drew comfort from figures indicating a rise of
14,000 in the number of unfilled vacancies at Jobcentres in December
compared with the previous month. In the three months to December,
seasonally adjusted vacancies increased on average by 5,700 per month.
Labour said the figures were further evidence that the economy was showing
no signs of recovery. 'Not merely has Britain had the fastest-rising
unemployment in Europe over the past year, but we have today the highest
level of unemployment of any country in Europe except Spain and Ireland,'
said Mr Tony Blair, shadow employment secretary.
Figures for the third quarter of last year showed that the number of people
employed in manufacturing industry had fallen by 88,000 compared with the
previous quarter, and by 96,000 in service industries.
At the same time the rise in average earnings in the year to November was
7.5 per cent, unchanged from October, and dashing hopes for a drop below 7
per cent.
The rate of increase of average earnings has been falling since it reached a
peak of 10.25 per cent in July 1990 but has not yet dropped below 7.5 per
cent, the lowest annual rate recorded in the 1980s, in spite of the
recession.
The Department of Employment said the rate of increase in the average
earnings index was likely to drop below 7.5 per cent when November wage
settlements, many of which were significantly below 1990 levels, fed through
into the December index.
The areas worst hit by unemployment included the south-east, where there was
a 0.2 percentage point increase on the previous month, bringing the rate of
unemployment to 8.1 per cent, and the south-west, where a 0.2 point increase
brought the rate up to 8.4 per cent.
Regionally the highest rates of unemployment were in Northern Ireland, the
north of England and the north-west, where rates were higher than the
national average. Greater London had an unemployment rate of 9.2 per cent.
Britain experienced the second-highest rate of unemployment among
industrialised countries in December compared with a year ago, second only
to Finland. Alfred Marks, the employment agency, said its year-on-year
figures for job vacancies showed that the London suburbs were the worst-hit,
experiencing a 66 per cent drop in vacancies. Central London suffered a drop
of 64 per cent.
