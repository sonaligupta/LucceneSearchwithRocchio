FT  27 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei at lowest level
since May 1986

   TOKYO


ARBITRAGE selling once again depressed share prices, and the Nikkei average
fell to the lowest level since May 1986, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index closed down 330.99 at 15,812.73, 4.3 per cent lower on the week,
having risen to the day's high of 16,227.22 in the morning on
bargain-hunting, and fallen to a low of 15,759.74 in the afternoon.
Volume remained low at 240m shares, down marginally from 249m. Declines led
advances by 660 to 274, with 178 unchanged. The Topix index of all first
section stocks fell 17.05 to 1,231.45 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50
index fell 6.05 to 963.44.
Traders blamed yesterday's weakness on a decline in blue chip electrical
stocks, which were sold on concerns about the higher yen. The dollar fell
Y1.20 against the yen to Y125.60, closing below Y126 for the first time in
four months.
Issues which had gained on Thursday lost ground on profit-taking. Hitachi
fell Y24 to Y741 and Toshiba by Y2 to Y631.
Companies affected by sharp falls in asset values were heavily sold. Banks,
constructions, and brokerages were among the largest losers of the day.
Analysts said that this reflected uncertainty stemming from a lack of
information. 'Market participants are going to assume the worst if they
don't know the full extent of the problems,' said Mr Bernard Siman, analyst
at Jardine Fleming.
Banks, whose bad loans are thought to amount to Y56,000bn, have failed to
disclose the real figures. Leading trust banks, known for their extensive
lending to real estate and stock speculators, are seen to be under severe
pressure. Mitsui Trust and Banking fell Y31 to a year's low of Y599, and
Mitsubishi Trust and Banking lost Y32 to Y735.
Misawa Homes, which held a press conference on Thursday following the sharp
fall in its share price on rumours of financial problems, fell Y69 to Y871.
Investors were not convinced by the company's denials, and were disturbed by
Misawa's announcement of a 95 per cent fall in consolidated after-tax
profits.
Daikyo, which plunged last week on rumours of cash flow problems, also fell
Y25 to Y705.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 199.59 to 18,737.53 in volume of 12.1m
shares.
Roundup
EXCITEMENTS abroad sustained Hong Kong, and brought new life to Manila
yesterday as Taiwan stayed weak.
HONG KONG closed at a record high but profit-taking in late trade dragged
the Hang Seng index down from its intra-day peak of 6,178.96, reflecting
London buying on Thursday, to close 34.41 higher at 6,111.10, 5.6 per cent
higher on the week.
Turnover stayed heavy at HKDollars 4.72bn against Thursday's HKDollars
4.89bn. HSBC, which won control of Midland Bank on Thursday, topped the
active list and rose 75 cents to HKDollars 48, unchanged from its close in
London.
MANILA rose 3.2 per cent on the day, but just 2.1 per cent better on a week
bedevilled by fluctuations in Philippine Long Distance Telephone (PLDT).
The composite index closed 47.41 higher at 1,525.31. PLDT's rise of 35 to
1,030 pesos encouraged bargain-hunting elsewhere.
TAIWAN fell across the board as small investors followed their bigger
brethren in dumping stocks, particularly financials.
The weighted index, down more than 110 points just before the close, ended
63.04 or 1.4 per cent lower at 4,501.97, 1.9 per cent down on the week.
Turnover was active at TDollars 36.2bn, up from TDollars 35.6bn.
SEOUL edged higher in a technical reaction to Thursday's decline to a
52-month low. The composite index climbed 3.79 to 552.09, down 3.3 per cent
on the week.
BOMBAY traded in only a few shares as brokers resumed their boycott. The BSE
index shed 0.78 to 3,080.54.
