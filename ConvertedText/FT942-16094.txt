FT  12 APR 94 / UK Company News: GWR to buy Mid Anglia for Pounds 3m


   By JOHN MURRELL


GWR, the expanding commercial radio group, has agreed terms for the
acquisition of Mid Anglia Radio.
Mid Anglia is an operator of four radio licences in Cambridgeshire and
Norfolk.
The offer, 0.53257 new GWR shares for every Mid Anglia share, values the
latter at 466p per share and the whole company at about Pounds 3.5m.
There is a cash alternative of 450p per share.
Irrevocable undertakings to accept the offer have been received in respect
of 378,456 shares, or 50.46 per cent of the equity.
Earlier this year, Bristol-based GWR paid Pounds 15m in cash and shares for
four radio companies in the Midlands.
The USM-traded group also owns a 17 per cent interest in Classic FM and a 48
per cent stake in Bulgaria's first independent radio station.
In the year to end-September 1993, GWR returned pre-tax profits of Pounds
913,000.
Turnover was Pounds 9.8m.
Earlier this month directors said revenues for the first half of the current
year were ahead strongly across the group.
They added that prospects for the remainder of the year 'remained positive'.
For the 12 months to September 30 1993, Mid Anglia incurred a deficit of
Pounds 12,186 before exceptional items on turnover of Pounds 2.14m.
Trading in the current year, however, had been 'more encouraging'.
