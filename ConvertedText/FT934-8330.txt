FT  16 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Sidlaw edges ahead to Pounds 11m - Sales
surge but underlying margins static in oil services


   By CATHERINE MILTON


PRE-TAX profits at Sidlaw, the Scotland-based packaging, oil services and
textiles company, rose just 5 per cent to Pounds 11.1m in the year to
September 30 in spite of an 87 per cent increase in turnover.
Sales rose to Pounds 172.9m (Pounds 92.5m), benefiting by about Pounds 60m
from an extension of the company's supply chain management business for
leading oil companies.
In October last year Sidlaw moved into chartering and managing standby and
supply vessels.
The company books all the revenue on each transaction, hence the jump in its
turnover, but retains only a management fee.
Sidlaw said underlying margins in the oil services division were static at
20 per cent.
Oil services sales rose to Pounds 94.5m (Pounds 33.7m) giving operating
profits of Pounds 7.25m (Pounds 6.7m).
The profit here included a small loss of Pounds 342,000 in the Supplylink
joint venture set up last year to offer logistics services internationally.
Drilling support work declined to about 20 per cent (24 per cent) of sales,
due partly to changes in the industry's tax structure. This figure would
always vary, the company said.
Sidlaw's packaging division saw sales ahead at Pounds 54.1m (Pounds 35.5m)
giving operating profits of Pounds 4.72m (Pounds 3.85m).
Sidlaw acquired Courtaulds Flexible Packaging just before its year end for
Pounds 78m, funded partly by a Pounds 53m rights issue and partly through
borrowings.
The move doubled the size of the company and took Sidlaw firmly into
continental Europe.
'Although it is early days with Flexible Packaging, we feel that we are
making good progress,' said Mr Digby Morrow, chief executive.
The textiles division improved sales to Pounds 24.3m (Pounds 23.3m) giving
operating profits of Pounds 564,000 (Pounds 833,000).
Interest charges rose to Pounds 1.54m (Pounds 1.17m) and gearing increased
to 73 per cent (29 per cent), lifted by the acquisition.
Net borrowings were Pounds 43.4m (Pounds 11.4m) at the year-end.
A proposed final dividend of 6.25p lifts the total from 10p to 10.5p on the
enlarged share capital.
Earnings per share slipped to 20.3p (20.9p).
COMMENTAny company confronting the aftermath of a substantial acquisition
during a period of economic difficulty may find profits more elusive than
expected in the short term. Sidlaw believes the Spanish and French economies
will remain weak for at least another year and is more confident than some
about the stability of its main market, the UK. However, the company's
recent reclassification as a packaging stock could lift the shares as they
move into the ambit of those with an appetite for the sector. Analysts'
forecasts for pre-tax profits are pitched at about the Pounds 18m mark,
putting the shares on a prospective multiple of 13.9. This looks cheap
against the packaging sector, reflecting Sidlaw's newcomer status.
