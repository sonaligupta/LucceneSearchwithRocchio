FT  29 OCT 93 / International Company News: Austria to sell part of holding
in bank


   By IAN RODGER


   ZURICH


CREDITANSTALT-Bankverein, Austria's second largest bank, said the Austrian
government has agreed to sell a large portion of its controlling
shareholding next year.
The bank would like the placing, which could be worth up to Sch6bn (Dollars
500m), to be spread widely among both domestic and international investors.
The government holds 49 per cent of the equity, but 70.5 per cent of the
voting power.
Mr Guido Schmidt-Chiari, chief executive, said that timing would depend on
market conditions, but the issue would probably come shortly after the bank
reports its 1993 results in late April or early May.
The bank reported third quarter pre-tax profits up 47 per cent to Sch1.38bn
and forecast 'substantially improved' results for the full year.
The Creditanstalt preferred share has been among the most active and buoyant
on the Vienna Borse this year, and the group is now capitalised at about
Sch34bn.
Mr Ferdinand Lacina, the finance minister, has made clear that the
government is eager to fully privatise the bank. But he wants at least one
large shareholder to take the government's place.
Last year, Mr Lacina held negotiations with General Electric of the US, and
earlier this year an abortive attempt was made to merge the bank with
Austria's Raiffeisen co-operative banking group.
If no such strong shareholder is found, the government may retain enough
shares after the placing to keep its voting control.
For the nine months, pre-tax profits were up 64.2 per cent to Sch3.7bn, but
the bank warned that its results in the first half of last year were
extremely depressed. Total assets at the end of September stood at
Sch530.6bn, down 4 per cent since the end of June.
Provisions for bad loans would again be high, but not as high as last year's
Sch5.66bn.
