FT  10 JAN 92 / Appointments: Lep links at an end


John Read, deposed as chairman and chief executive of Lep Group after a
boardroom coup in November, has resigned as a non-executive director of
Govett Strategic Investment Trust. His departure ends a long association
between Lep, the troubled distribution and security group, and what used to
be the flagship of the John Govett investment trust stable.
Govett Strategic used to specialise in taking strategic stakes in vulnerable
companies and replacing the management but more recently has come under
attack itself because of its poor performance. Govett was instrumental in
getting Read appointed chairman of Lep in 1982 and until October 1987 it had
a big stake in Lep.
Read went on the Govett Strategic board in 1985, and his links with the fund
manager also led to his appointment to the board of the Macarthy chemist
chain.
William Govett, a former chairman of John Govett and a director of Govett
Strategic since 1975, resigned as a non-executive Lep director in June after
eight years on the board.
Meanwhile, John Read may soon lose another job - his non-executive
chairmanship of Macarthy - if the Monopolies and Mergers Commission gives a
green light to either of two rival bids.

Prudential, which last month quit the Unit Trust Association after a very
public tiff, has appointed Jonathan Mindell to the new post of marketing
director in its unit trust operation.
Mindell, who moves from the post of marketing director of the now-defunct
Town and Country Building Society, co-ordinated the launch of Marks and
Spencer Financial Services into the unit trust and Personal Equity Plan
market. His task at Prudential will be to strengthen the company's existing
marketing of unit trusts in the UK as well as examine plans to develop
similar products for sale in Europe.
The UTA is urging that unit trusts, unlike life insurance, be 'de-polarised'
so that they can be sold through more sales outlets. Prudential, like the
rest of the life insurance industry, opposes the move.
If unit trusts are de-polarised, will Mindell be responsible for exploiting
the new marketing opportunities as well? 'We'll cross that bridge when we
come to it,' says the Pru.
