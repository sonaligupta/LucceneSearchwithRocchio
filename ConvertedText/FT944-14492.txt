FT  22 OCT 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Copper reaches 4-year
high


   By KENNETH GOODING and DEBORAH HARGREAVES


London Metal Exchange prices burst upwards this week taking copper to its
highest level for nearly four years. Aluminium and nickel prices also rose
sharply, respectively to four-year and two-year peaks.
The upward surge was helped by a weakening US dollar, which made base metals
prices look cheaper in other currencies, but was particularly influenced by
investment fund and speculator buying.
This explains in part why metals prices are moving up strongly even though
LME stocks - except copper - are still substantial. The funds are
anticipating strong global economic activity that will translate into high
metals demand.
Since the depressed conditions of last autumn, LME three-month copper prices
have risen by 60 per cent, aluminium by 70 per cent and nickel by 75 per
cent. Some selling and book-squaring ahead of the weekend left prices last
night lower than at Thursday's close. Nevertheless, Copper closed 3 per cent
higher than on Friday last week at USDollars 2,556.50 a tonne, aluminium was
2.7 per cent up at Dollars 1,753.25 a tonne and nickel had advanced by 4.7
per cent to Dollars 6,987.50.
Some analysts suggested there were solid reasons for the surge. Mr Wiktor
Bielski, analyst at Bain & Co, a Deutsche Bank subsidiary, said that
first-half demand for aluminium, copper and nickel, had risen by 7 per cent
compared with the same months of 1993, while lead and zinc demand was up by
4 per cent, 'twice as strong as even ardent bulls had predicted'.
Meanwhile, added Mr Bielski, supplies had fallen along with exports from the
former eastern bloc - apart from those of aluminium. Also, some LME stock
was not immediately available because it was tied up by financing deals.
'Sensationally strong' fundamentals would ensure that, even if prices fell
because of profit-taking, they would recover quickly, he insisted.
However, Mr Nick Moore at Ord Minnett, an associate of Jardine Fleming,
warned there was a great deal of moth-balled capacity that producers could
quickly re-activate. 'The market is behaving as if stocks are at critically
low levels and they clearly are not.'
He pointed out that only copper, where stocks represent 5.6 weeks of
consumption, is nearing levels where the stocks-to-consumption ratio is
critical. Lead stocks amounted to more than nine weeks consumption,
aluminium eight weeks, while zinc and nickel have stocks for 17 and 19 weeks
respectively.
Given the size of the stocks, nickel's price rise this week surprised some
observers. However. Mr Heinz Pariser of Heinz H Pariser Alloy Metals & Steel
Market Research, said that nickel demand was likely to grow by 7.7 per cent
to a record 740,000 tonnes this year, leaving the market with a
33,000-tonnes supply shortage.
Meanwhile, coffee prices went on a rollercoaster ride this week as traders
reacted to rain on Brazil's drought-stricken coffee trees and to reports
detailing the extent of damage to the 1995-1996 crop.
Reports from Brazil show that trees previously undamaged by the two frosts
earlier this year are now being affected by drought. After the frosts, the
Brazilian government estimated that the 1995-1996 crop would fall to 15.7m
bags, but current estimates are looking gloomier.
The January futures contract at the London Commodity Exchange ended the week
just over Dollars 150 a tonne higher at Dollars 3,660 a tonne.
