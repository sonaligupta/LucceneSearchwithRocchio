FT  02 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Korea and Japan in deal to lower deficit


   By JOHN BURTON


   SEOUL


SOUTH Korea and Japan yesterday announced an agreement to help reduce
Seoul's trade deficit with Tokyo, but the measures fall far short of what
Korean officials had been expecting.
South Korea's trade deficit with Japan last year amounted to Dollars 8.8bn
(Pounds 4.7bn), which accounted for 90 per cent of the country's total trade
deficit. South Korea relies heavily on Japan for machinery and industrial
components. The trade deficit would be even bigger if it was not for import
restrictions that South Korea places on Japanese products.
Mr Roh Tae Woo, the South Korean president, and Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the
Japanese prime minister, agreed in January to try to find a solution to the
problem, with a deadline set for June 30. Tokyo was under pressure to make
concessions at that time due to new revelations about Japanese war crimes
against Koreans. Seoul's main demand has been the establishment of a Dollars
200m industrial foundation, financed mostly by Japan.
But Tokyo only agreed that each country should provide Dollars 8.3m.
