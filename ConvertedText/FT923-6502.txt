FT  24 AUG 92 / Observer: Happy days


How time flies. Russia's Central Bank is issuing 1m three-rouble coins
commemorating the democratic victory over Communist hard-liners who launched
last year's abortive coup.
Three roubles, which is less than three cents at the current exchange rate,
can buy little these days in Russia: six rides on the Moscow subway or a
newspaper. Before the coup, three roubles could buy 60 subway rides, or a
hearty lunch in a state-subsidized cafeteria.
