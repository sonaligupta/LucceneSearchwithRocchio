FT  15 JUN 93 / Exports weaken in engineering


   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent


WEAKENING DEMAND in continental Europe is holding back the engineering
industry, and the competitive advantage created by last year's sterling
devaluation is diminishing, the latest survey of company performance in the
west Midlands shows.
The survey was carried out by the Engineering Employers' Federation, which
surveyed 470 companies.
The proportion of companies reporting a rise in domestic orders rose to 46
per cent in May from 36 per cent in February, but fewer companies reported
an increase in export orders. In February 30 per cent of companies reported
an increase. This has now slipped to 27 per cent.
Mr David Botterill, chief executive of the regional federation, said:
'Recovery will be muted if major export markets are moving in the opposite
direction to our own.'
He said that the competitive position of engineering companies in Europe had
been enhanced by sterling's devaluation, relatively low labour costs and by
the growing readiness of German companies to seek supplies in lower-cost
markets.
But he noted that, on the basis of the federation's own studies and talks
with members, German companies were trying to reduce their costs by putting
pressure for price reductions on their suppliers. This inevitably led to
pressure on the margins of British exporters.
In spite of the problems in Europe, 48 per cent of west Midlands engineering
companies have growing order books, compared with 42 per cent in February.
This has been translated into a greater use of factory capacity.
For the first time since summer 1989 - except for a blip after the general
election last year - raw material stocks have shown net growth.
