FT  20 MAY 92 / International Company News: Volvo registers first-quarter
loss - Contrasting results from two leading European car makers

   STOCKHOLM


VOLVO, the Swedish vehicle group which is moving closer to a possible merger
with Renault, suffered a first-quarter loss of SKr248m (Dollars 43m) after
financial items. This contrasts with a SKr340m profit for the same period of
1991.
The return to the red at Volvo with a SKr347m operating loss for the first
quarter follows a small SKr88m operating profit in the fourth quarter of
1991 following five consecutive quarterly operating losses. It recorded a
SKr397m deficit for the first quarter of last year.
By contrast, group sales revenue rose by 10 per cent to SKr20.02bn for the
first quarter of 1992, from SKr17.46bn last year.
Total group assets rose to SKr108.6bn from SKr106.7bn at the end of December
due to acquisitions and divestments, while liquid funds fell to SKr18.4bn in
the first quarter from SKr18.8bn.
Return on capital employed rose to 6.2 per cent in the latest 12-month
period from 3.8 per cent last time, while income per share was SKr2. I0
compared with a loss of SKr12.90.
The negative trend in its most important vehicle markets - the US, Britain
and Sweden - had brought 'heavy pressure' on the group's profits
performance.
But the company also pointed out the operating loss had 'declined
significantly', mainly due to rationalisation measures, first adopted in the
autumn of 1990. Volvo estimates its cost level - calculated on an annual
basis - was reduced by SKr500m.
So far, cost-saving measures have totalled SKr3.5bn, and by the end of this
year Volvo calculates its total cost level will have been cut by as much as
SKr5.2bn.
But the group said yesterday that 'despite this achievement, continued
efficiency improvements and aggressive marketing efforts' were required.
It added that the alliance with Renault had already yielded gains and this
would strengthen the group's long-term competitiveness, while co-operation
with Japanese car maker Mitsubishi would provide Volvo with 'important
knowledge in the area of production technology' in the medium-size car
range.
Volvo's truck division sales, meanwhile, rose by 8 per cent to SKr7.42bn
from SKr6.55b. n Volvo said there had been some recovery in the US and
Britain in the first quarter and its share of the truck market had risen
slightly in Europe.
