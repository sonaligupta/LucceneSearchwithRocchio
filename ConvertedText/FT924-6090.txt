FT  23 NOV 92 / The ERM Realignment: Norway overnight lending rate up again

NORWAY'S central bank last night was forced to raise its key overnight
lending rate for the second time in three days following the realignment of
the Spanish and Portuguese currencies in the ERM, which failed to relieve
pressure on the krone, Karen Fossli reports from Oslo.
The Bank of Norway increased the key rate to 25 per cent from 17 per cent,
the level to which it was raised on Friday after Sweden floated its currency
and interest shifted to the krone as a possible target for devaluation.
Both the finance minister and the governor of the central bank have promised
to use every weapon available to defend the krone.
The minority Labour government last night also announced the abolition of
electricity tariffs charged to heavy industry, in a move designed to bolster
competitiveness against Sweden, the country's main trading partner, since
the devaluation of its currency.
The abolition from Friday of the electricity tariff has been estimated by
analysts to enable annual saving of NKr800m (Pounds 82m) to industry.
