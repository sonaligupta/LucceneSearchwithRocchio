FT  26 MAY 93 / International Company News: Declining European sales hit
Ford

DETERIORATING economic conditions in continental European countries mean
that Ford Motor no longer expects to be operating in the black in the area
this year, Mr Wayne Booker, head of the company's international automotive
operations, said yesterday.
Earlier this year, Ford had declared that its goal was to break even or
better in Europe in 1993.
This would reverse last year's losses, but in April the company announced a
first-quarter European loss of Dollars 82m.
Mr Booker, speaking at a New York press briefing, said that when the company
made its earlier projections it had not expected the current 20 per cent
decline in the continental vehicle market, due to slowdowns in all the
leading economies.
A mild recovery in the British economy, where Ford is the car market leader,
was not likely to offset the continental decline.
Ford now expected total demand in Germany to be around 3.8m units this year,
compared with nearly 4m in 1992 and the peak of 4.2m reached after
unifica-tion.
The company's results would also be affected by currency weakness in some
countries, notably Italy, where it has 12 per cent of the market share.
However, Ford expected to gain market share in Europe, due largely to the
introduction in March of its new medium-range car, the Mondeo.
Turning to Asia, Mr Booker said Ford might consider making a making a large
capital expenditure in China in two to three years' time.
One of the reasons the group had been reluctant to enter the market was the
lack of a local supplier base, but Ford's automotive components group
recently signed letters of intent with two Chinese automotive suppliers to
study possible joint ventures around Shanghai.
Ford is also expected to announce next month the names of the first of a
chain of dealerships it is establishing in China.
