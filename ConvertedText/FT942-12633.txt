FT  28 APR 94 / International Company News: Declining oil price hits profits
at Chevron


   By PATRICK HARVERSON


   NEW YORK


Chevron has become the latest US oil group to suffer from declining oil
prices, with a 14 per cent drop in first-quarter earnings, to Dollars 424m.
After special charges of Dollars 36m to cover environmental remediation
costs and the resolution of certain royalty issues with regulators, the
group posted net income of Dollars 388m, or Dollars 1.19 a share.
Blaming lower oil prices for the earnings decline, Mr Ken Derr, chairman and
chief executive, said the group's 'crude oil realisations averaged about
Dollars 4 per barrel less than in last year's first quarter'. He also said
temporary stoppages squeezed the group's sales margins.
The negative impact of these developments was partly offset by higher
production volumes and downstream sales margins from international
operations, rising US natural gas prices, and lower operating and
administrative costs, which fell 5 cents a barrel to Dollars 6.47.
Total group revenues fell to Dollars 8.3bn, from Dollars 9.1bn in the same
quarter a year ago.
