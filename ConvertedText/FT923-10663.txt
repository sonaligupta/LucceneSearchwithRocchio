FT  29 JUL 92 / Building ex-chief faces Pounds 1m theft trial


   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent


DR GERALD SMITH, former chief executive of Farr, the failed west country
construction company, has been committed for trial at Southwark Crown Court,
London, charged with stealing cash and securities worth more than Pounds
1.2m from the Farr Group pension fund.
Dr Smith, of Islington, north London, was remanded on bail of Pounds
100,000.
He faces 14 charges of theft between September 11 1989 and February 23 1990.
The charges include the alleged theft of shares in British Airports
Authority, Barclays Bank, J. Sainsbury, Ladbroke Group and Hanson, belonging
to the pension fund.
He is also accused of stealing a cheque for almost Pounds 1m owed to the
fund.
Ernst & Young, which has been appointed trustee to the pension fund, hopes
it will be able to inform pension members that the fund is back in positive
balance when it meets them in the autumn.
The construction arm of Farr Group, one of the UK's largest privately owned
building and civil engineering companies, went into receivership in December
1990.
The construction businesses, based in Westbury, Wiltshire, had a combined
annual turnover of about Pounds 80m and employed about 700 workers.
The group's contracts included the 2.7-mile Axminster bypass on the A35 in
Devon.
