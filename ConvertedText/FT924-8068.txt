FT  13 NOV 92 / Ceasefire brings respite to the Bosnian capital

ISOLATED outbreaks of fighting were reported yesterday in Bosnia on the
first day of the latest ceasefire agreed earlier this week between Serb,
Croat and Moslem military representatives in Sarajevo. UN officers, however,
reported that up to nightfall the ceasefire appeared to be generally
holding.
Shelling was reported at Travnik, 65 miles west of Sarajevo, which is
crammed with thousands of refugees, and at Bihac in northwest Bosnia, where
French troops in the UN's convoy protection operation are based.
Meanwhile, UN plans for escorting relief convoys in Bosnia risk being
seriously set back by delays in deploying Canadian troops to the Serb
stronghold of Banja Luka. It is feared that because of difficulties with
local authorities, deployment may not be possible until February.
The mission is politically crucial since it is the only one of the UN
operations in Bosnia specifically aimed at a Serb area. 'We have got to be
seen to be impartial,' said Brig Roddy Cordy-Simpson, chief of staff at the
UN's Bosnia-Hercegovina command at Kiseljak near Sarajevo. The Canadian
mission is also crucial to opening up the route from Zagreb to the centre of
Bosnia-Hercegovina for humanitarian aid.
UK military planners are meanwhile switching their attention to securing
passage through battle lines on main roads. Lt Col Bob Stewart, the British
battalion commander, said the army had reached the conclusion that it would
be nearly impossible to send sufficiently large amounts of aid along
mountain roads.
