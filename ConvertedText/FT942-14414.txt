FT  20 APR 94 / International Company News: Four Seasons pushed into loss


   By BERNARD SIMON


Four Seasons Hotels, the luxury hotel chain which is presently up for sale,
has reported a strong improvement in operations, but was pushed into a hefty
1993 loss by write-downs on several properties.
The write-downs, totalling CDollars 117m (USDollars 84m), resulted in a net
l993 loss of CDollars 119.2m, or CDollars 4.30 a share, compared with
earnings of CDollars 7.7m, or 32 cents a share, a year earlier.
Operating earnings grew to CDollars 35.1m from CDollars 12.3m, due partly to
the acquisition in August 1992 of Regent International Hotels.
The company, which manages 38 Four Seasons and Regent hotels, with another
seven under construction, said the final quarter of 1993 and early 1994
'provide the first tangible evidence that our business is solidly recovering
from the prolonged reces-sion'.
Luxury hotel reservations were up 12 per cent and group sales bookings up 24
per cent in the fourth quarter.
Mr Isadore Sharp, Four Seasons' founder and controlling shareholder,
recently put the entire company up for sale.
An official of the company said yesterday that the process was likely to be
a 'deliberate, slow' one.
Seven properties, including the Four Seasons in London (formerly Inn on the
Park), are also on the block, although Four Seasons will continue to manage
the hotels.
These sales are expected to be completed over the next 18 to 24 months.
