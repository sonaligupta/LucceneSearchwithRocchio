FT  30 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: Johannesburg weakens


South African shares saw sizeable declines as buyers steered clear of the
market following overnight selling of local stocks in New York and a fall in
gold bullion.
Traders said volumes had been low, indicating the lack of interest in the
market.
The firmer financial rand also impacted on rand prices of key stocks and
helped to slow trade.
The overall index shed 84 to 5,749.9, the industrial index was 47.4 down at
6,886.8 and the gold shares index lost 98.5 or 4.8 per cent at 1,957.5.
De Beers relinquished R2.25 at R91.25 in line with losses in New York
overnight, while Anglos dropped R4 to R228.
Vaal Reefs tumbled R14 to R365 and Kloof moved down R2.75 to R56.75.
Rusplats declined R2 to R109.50.
SAB weakened R2 to R96 and Sasol R2.25 to R31, but Engen rose 50 cents to
R33.75 and Hiveld R1 to R36.50.
