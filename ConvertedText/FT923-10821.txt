FT  28 JUL 92 / International Company News: Fresh talks as battle for NY
Daily News steps up


   By ALAN FRIEDMAN


   NEW YORK


THE two rival offers for The Daily News, the New York tabloid acquired in
March 1991 by the late Mr Robert Maxwell, will be the subject of a fresh
round of discussions this week, amid signs that the battle is intensifying.
Mr Conrad Black, the Canadian publisher who owns The Daily Telegraph in
London, will be in New York today for negotiations with trade union leaders,
creditors and the newspaper's management.
Mr Mortimer Zuckerman, the New York-based owner of US News and World Report
magazine and The Atlantic Monthly, will also hold talks today with members
of The Daily News creditors' committee. Mr Zuckerman has met previously with
union leaders as well as members of the newspaper's management.
A New York bankruptcy court recently extended until the end of this month
the deadline by which The Daily News must file a reorganisation plan under
Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code. The newspaper filed for Chapter 11
protection from creditors last December.
The July 31 court deadline could be extended once more, if, as expected, the
complex negotiations drag on.
Although no clear favourite has emerged from the talks, Mr Zuckerman is
understood to have presented himself to union leaders as the more New
York-oriented and hands-on of the two prospective bidders. Securing the
support of the 12 unions involved will be crucial in winning control of the
newspaper.
'We are continuing our negotiations and we intend to meet the creditors,' Mr
Zuckerman said yesterday.
