FT  23 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lamont row forces expenses rule
shift


   By RALPH ATKINS


CONTROVERSY over the Treasury's help towards the private legal expenses of
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, led yesterday to revised rules on the use
of public money for matters related to ministers' personal affairs.
The government guidelines, drawn up by the Cabinet Office, say 'great care'
must be exercised when public funds are offered towards extra personal costs
arising from ministers' public duties. Departmental accounting officers
should always be consulted.
The guidelines were written after discussions with government law officers
and after a review recommended by the Commons public accounts committee in
February.
The committee expressed regret that the Treasury had not highlighted in its
accounts the decision to pay Pounds 4,700 towards the Pounds 22,000 costs of
evicting an unwanted tenant from Mr Lamont's private home.
The guidelines say that 'in exceptional cases, particularly those in which
the private interests of ministers are involved, consideration should also
be given to informing the comptroller and auditor-general of any payment
which it is decided to make'.
The rules accept there is justification for sometimes using public funds to
offset private loss when ministers are faced with unavoidable extra costs as
a result of their official position.
'In cases which are not clear-cut, considerations of propriety and public
defensibility must be paramount,' they add. 'As a general rule, it is right
to err on the side of caution in the use of public funds,' the rules say.
