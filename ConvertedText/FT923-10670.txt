FT  29 JUL 92 / Creditors to meet on future of firm


   By ANDREW JACK


CREDITORS to Hook Harris, a small accountancy firm based in the south of
England, will meet on Friday to determine the future of the practice, which
entered an individual voluntary arrangement under insolvency law this month,
Andrew Jack writes.
The firm, which employs 60 staff in Southampton, Salisbury and the Isle of
Wight, is the latest of a growing number of professional practices to file
for protection from creditors because of the recession.
The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales estimates that
two or three practices have been entering voluntary arrangements each month
over the past 18 months, and that one practice a month has become bankrupt.
Hook Harris is believed to have liabilities exceeding Pounds 1m and was
forced to seek protection under the individual voluntary arrangement after
National Westminster, its banker, refused to continue supporting it.
The firm's costs rose sharply after it moved into new offices in Newport,
Isle of Wight, in 1990. It has run into cashflow difficulties recently
because many clients have not paid their bills.
