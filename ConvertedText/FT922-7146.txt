JAPANESE cotton spinners reported mixed results for the fiscal year to
March.
Kurabo Industries posted a 19.4 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y1.8bn
(Dollars 13.5m) on a 2.6 per cent rise in sales to Y144.4bn. After-tax
profits rose 6.2 per cent to Y1.8bn.
For the current year to March, Kurabo forecasts a 19.5 per cent rise in
pre-tax profits to Y2.2bn on a 2.4 per cent increase in sales to Y148bn.
Daiwabo returned to the black with a non-consolidated pre-tax profit of
Y1bn, against the previous year's loss of Y162m. Overall sales fell 5.7 per
cent to Y71.1bn due to sluggish sales of cotton yarn.
However, Daiwabo posted after-tax losses of Y873m due to a Y2.8bn
extraordinary loss as a result of inventory liquidation. Daiwabo said it
will not pay annual dividends.
For the current year to March 1993, it expects a 22.5 per cent decline in
pre-tax profits to Y800m on a 4.2 per cent increase in sales to Y74.2bn.
Shikibo posted a pre-tax loss of Y5.3bn against the previous year's loss of
Y1.3bn. Sales rose 11.9 per cent to Y77.5bn.
However, Shikibo posted an extraordinary loss of Y13.5bn due to the
liquidation of its two financing affiliates, which incurred heavy losses as
a result of extensive stock speculation. After-tax losses totalled Y4.7bn.
The company will also skip its dividend payment.
For the current year, Shikibo expects to reduce its pre-tax loss to Y2bn.
