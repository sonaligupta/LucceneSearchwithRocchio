FT  25 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Abitibi-Price outlook bleak


   By AP-DJ


ABITIBI-PRICE, the newsprint and paper producer, controlled by Toronto's
Reichmann family, admitted its key markets remained depressed, but added
'the free fall in prices may be near the bottom,' AP-DJ reports.
It had already reported a 1991 loss of CDollars 75.9m, (USDollars 63.7m), or
CDollars 1.12 a share, on revenues of CDollars 2.8bn. The 1991 results
included pre-tax, non-recurring charges and write-downs of CDollars 44.4m.
Capital spending was expected to rise to about CDollars 50m in 1992 from
CDollars 38.5m last year, while long-term debt stood at CDollars 370.8m at
the year-end.
Abitibi, in its annual report, said: 'The outlook for the newsprint industry
in North America is not expected to improve appreciably in 1992 unless there
is a marked increase in US consumption or further mill or machine closures.'
It added some improvement in markets were expected in 1993.
'We are now facing the same (newsprint) price wars and ferocious competition
offshore that we have seen in domestic markets.' It expects further price
weakness in overseas markets this year.
