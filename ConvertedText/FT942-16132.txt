FT  12 APR 94 / Observer: Heady stuff


What is it with headhunting all of a sudden? First the TV series, now a
novel, oozing with sex and corruption, entitled The Headhunter, by Juliette
Mead, an ex-headhunter.
But it is not just the media that are beguiled by this peculiar line of
work. Anne Ferguson, an ICI veteran of more than 20 years' standing - who
ran ICI's World Class campaign and masterminded the search for Zeneca's
marvellously obscure name - has just answered the call to join Spencer
Stuart, one of the big international search companies.
So how does a high-profile career in marketing prepare you for being a
headhunter? 'Both are about helping find solutions,' says Ferguson glibly.
Except in the minds of those who think the latter species create the
problems.
