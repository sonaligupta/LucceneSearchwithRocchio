FT  27 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Tex reduces loss to Pounds 0.4m


Tex Holdings, the Ipswich-based supplier of consumables to the plastic,
steel and energy industries, cut its pre-tax loss from Pounds 522,000 to
Pounds 396,000 in the year to March 31.
The directors said it had been necessary to implement further restructuring
during the year and, as part of a move to cut the cost base still further,
the workforce had been reduced by 20 per cent to 324.
Turnover was lower at Pounds 16.1m (Pounds 18.3m). There was an unchanged
loss per share of 5p and no dividend is proposed.
A further extraordinary charge of Pounds 77,000 was made in respect of
discontinued activities at Somercotes and Burgess Hill.
