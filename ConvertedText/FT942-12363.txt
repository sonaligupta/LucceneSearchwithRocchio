FT  29 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brussels plans to blacklist CAP
fraudsters


   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES


Companies involved in defrauding the Common Agricultural Policy could be
permanently excluded from participating in any European Union regimes,
according to a proposal by the European Commission.
The Commission yesterday formally put its plans for drawing up a blacklist
of companies involved in fraudulent activities to member governments.
The idea of a blacklist follows a report from the European Court of Auditors
criticising the Commission and member countries for not doing enough to
stamp out fraud in the Ecu36bn farm budget. Some estimates put the amount of
farm funds lost through fraud at Ecu200m a year.
The Commission is now looking at a system for levying penalties at EU-level
from companies involved in fraud. Penalties are currently left to individual
member governments which are not consistent in applying them.
Mr Rene Steichen, the EU farm commissioner, wants to make the blacklist
available in all EU countries so that companies could find their trading
activities affected.
'Even the suspicion of fraud could be enough to get some companies put on
the blacklist,' said one Commission official.
The Commission is also trying to get around the problem of companies
involved in defrauding the CAP closing down and opening up under another
name.
The blacklist is expected to target companies or traders which have
deliberately or as a result of serious negligence defrauded farm funds or
can be justifiably suspected of having done so. But the Commission is aware
that the measure could be highly sensitive legally and politically.
In addition, the blacklist is not likely to be adopted much before the end
of the year as the Commission must wait for an opinion from the European
Parliament. Elections to the parliament will hold its comments up until
September at the earliest.
