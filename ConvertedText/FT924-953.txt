Now for the showdown on last Monday's quiz about gunfighters of the old
American West. The questions, and answers, were:
1. Name the Magnificent Seven. Chris (played by Yul Brynner), Vin (Steve
McQueen), O'Reilly (Charles Bronson), Lee (Robert Vaughn), Britt (James
Coburn), Harry Luck (Brad Dexter) and Chico (Horst Buchholz).
2. Which western gunfighter became sports editor of the New York Morning
Telegraph? Bat Masterson.
3. Which was married to Mrs Thatcher? Wild Bill Hickok. She was Mrs Agnes
Lake Thatcher of the family that ran the Lake circus troupe.
4. Which rival did he dispose of and so win her affections? A circus lion
which attacked her in the ring.
Although nobody produced a perfect entry, the bottle of malt goes to Frank
Haigh of Ottawa who came nearest. Besides getting the first three right, he
answered the fourth with: 'Ruffians at her circus'.
