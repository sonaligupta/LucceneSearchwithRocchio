FT  15 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Placing to raise Pounds 15m will value
Metrotect at Pounds 26m


   By PETER PEARSE


METROTECT Industries yesterday revealed plans to float via a placing of
ordinary shares later this month. It is raising Pounds 15m, the maximum
allowed by the Stock Exchange without a general offer to investors.
The issue will value the company at about Pounds 26m.
It also announced sharply higher profits for the year ended March 31.
Metrotect, which manufactures and supplies plasticised materials and
products to protect underground and underwater pipelines reported pre-tax
figures up from Pounds 679,000 to Pounds 2.27m on turnover doubled to Pounds
22.6m (Pounds 11.4m).
Of the Pounds 15m, some Pounds 8.25m will be from the sale of stakes held by
existing shareholders.
These include the management and 3i and County NatWest Ventures, which
backed the management buy-out from BPB Industries in April 1990.
The management team - which numbers 11 people, led by Mr Brian Thomas, and
is unchanged since the MBO - is selling one third of its collective holding.
The balance of Pounds 6.75m will be used to repay debt and to rationalise
and simplify the share structure into one class of ordinary.
This will leave the company with about Pounds 1m net cash, which will go
towards working capital requirements.
Panmure Gordon, the stockbroker, has issued the pathfinder prospectus.
Metrotect said that overseas markets accounted for about 90 per cent of its
sales.
The directors said the order book was encouraging. A contract has just been
won to provide coating materials for 540 miles of pipeline from Hainan
Island to Hong Kong.
