FT  15 NOV 93 / Clarke to meet TUC as hostility fades


   By DAVID GOODHART


MR KENNETH CLARKE, the chancellor, has agreed to twice-yearly informal
meetings with the Trades Union Congress, marking a further shift away from
the outright hostility of recent years between the government and the TUC,
David Goodhart writes.
Mr John Monks has had several meetings with ministers since becoming TUC
general secretary in September and believes that more regular contact will
become routine.
'It is difficult to judge whether this dialogue has any significance,' said
Mr Monks. 'But there seems to be an intellectual interest in the link
between labour market changes and the perceived problems of society.'
He said that although there was still a very strong government interest in
labour market deregulation, 'I think there is a recognition that things are
going in a direction inimical to the traditional values that the prime
minister claims to espouse and that the world of work may be connected with
this development'.
Mr Monks also said that the campaign to retain the automatic check-off of
union members' dues had helped recruit more members.
Before next August all employers with a check-off system have to ask those
on the system whether they wish to continue. At British Rail the RMT
transport union says it is receiving regular payment of union dues from
about 80 per cent of its members after BR withdrew from check-off.
