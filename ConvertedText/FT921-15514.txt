FT  09 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: CSX to take Dollars 755m
charge for job cuts


   By NIKKI TAIT


   NEW YORK


CSX, the large transportation group, yesterday announced it planned to take
a Dollars 755m pre-tax charge against its fourth-quarter earnings.
Much of the charge relates to planned job cuts and productivity improvements
in its railroad operations, which range over about 20 states to the east of
the Mississippi.
Most of the US railroad companies have announced similar moves in the wake
of a new framework labour agreement, which was finally negotiated with some
congressional help, last year. The companies have been implementing this at
local level, via further union negotiations.
CSX declined to say how many jobs it expected to save on the grounds that
discussions with the unions were continuing. The railroad division employs
some 36,000 people.
However, the company stressed that the charge was designed to cover
workforce reductions across all its divisions, not just the railroad
operation. Of the Dollars 755m, Dollars 634m related to the job cuts. At the
post-tax level, the total charge reduced to Dollars 490m.
Separately, the company announced a Dollars 318m pre-tax charge, also in the
fourth quarter, as a result of the US accounting change on non-pension
retiree benefits.
Many US companies have been taking similar charges on this score.
The Virginia-based company added that it expected to make a net loss in 1991
as a result of these moves, having clocked up profits of Dollars 280m in the
first nine months.
CSX shares rose Dollars  1/2 to close at Dollars 56 1/8 in New York.
