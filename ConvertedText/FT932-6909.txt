FT  26 MAY 93 / International Company News: TDK unveils 43% decline in
parent pre-tax income


   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO


TDK, the world's largest manufacturer of magnetic tapes, yesterday unveiled
a 43 per cent fall in parent pre-tax profits to Y18.9bn (Dollars 171.8m) for
the year to March, in the face of a sharp downturn in the Japanese economy.
Sales dropped 10 per cent to Y367.3bn, while net profits fell by 43 per cent
to Y10bn.
In particular, sales of electronic materials and components were adversely
affected by the sluggishness of the Japanese economy and fell 10 per cent.
Recording media sales, meanwhile, slipped 9 per cent, due in part to a
decline in tape exports to Europe resulting from the opening of a new
factory in Luxembourg.
While demand from computer manufactures was buoyant, that from audio and
video manufacturers was very weak, TDK said.
Consolidated pre-tax profits fell 30.9 per cent to Y33.5bn - having also
been affected by the sharp appreciation of the yen - and growth in overseas
business was not able to offset the slump in Japan.
TDK expects parent pre-tax profits to increase marginally to Y19bn on sales
1.5 per cent up to Y362bn.
