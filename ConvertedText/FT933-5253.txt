FT  04 SEP 93 / OFT urged to probe Times cut


THE OFFICE of Fair Trading is considering a request from the Labour party to
investigate Mr Rupert Murdoch's decision to cut the weekday price of The
Times from 45p to 30p, a move which The Independent fears will drive it out
of business, write Ian Hargreaves and David Owen.
The OFT said yesterday that Sir Bryan Carsberg, the director-general of fair
trading, was 'monitoring developments and would give serious consideration
to any representation on the matter'.
Later it said it had received a submission from Mr Robin Cook, Labour's
trade and industry spokesman.
Mr Cook's letter - also signed by Ms Ann Clwyd, Labour's national heritage
spokeswoman - asked the OFT to instigate a monopoly reference to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission on 'whether the dominant position of News
Corporation and its subsidiary companies . . . is resulting in unfair
competition.'
Noting that The Times was 'already loss-making', the letter expressed
concern that the price cut 'could well lead to other competitors without
external financial subsidies being forced out of the market'.
It said: 'An investigation is required to establish whether this constitutes
an anti-competitive practice under the Competition Act.'
