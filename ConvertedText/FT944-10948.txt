FT  08 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Dollar rerating


   By PETER JOHN and JEFFREY BROWN


A re-evaluation of the dollar's potential by one of the big integrated
securities houses prompted downgrades and subsequent price weakness in
leading earners of US currency.
SG Warburg was said to have moved its end-of-year forecast by around 10
cents to Dollars 1.65 against sterling and its 1995 estimate to Dollars
1.70. Among stocks to be downgraded by the house sector specialists was
Cable and Wireless: the forecast for profits for the year to March 1995 came
down by Pounds 70m to Pounds 1.13bn and the following year's estimate by
Pounds 100m to Pounds 1.2bn. The shares fell 8 to 399p in spite of the
encouraging reports that the company was anticipating a joint venture with
AT&T, the US giant.
BAT Industries shed 2 to 432p despite a buy recommendation from Williams De
Broe, Glaxo dropped 12 to 596p and Zeneca fell 10 to 856p.
A follow on from heavy selling in New York saw the share prices of oil
majors BP and Shell ignore comforting fundamental news. The combined
weakness in the stocks was responsible for knocking 6 points off the FT-SE
100 Index.
The falls of 11 1/2 to 416p, ex-dividend, in BP and 9 1/2 to 711p in Shell
came in spite of news that the Department of Trade and Industry had granted
the two companies permission to start work on the potentially lucrative
Foinaven oilfield, west of Shetland and Orkney. The field is expected to
produce oil in less than 3 1/2 years from discovery, compared with an
average of 9 1/2 years for North Sea finds.
Interim results at the top end of analysts' estimates saw airports group BAA
weaken 24 1/2 to 492 1/2 p as profit-takers moved in following a sell
indication from BZW. The stock, which has been a very strong performer over
the past year, was heavily marked down at the outset, with 5.8m traded by
the close.
BZW's advice to clients was that BAA had moved into 'expensive territory'.
Over the past year the shares have run some 15 per cent ahead of the market
as a whole and outperformed by 5 per cent over the past month.
Ahead of today's second-quarter results, British Airways also lost ground,
dipping 5 to 357p. The stock was not helped by the threat of strike action
at Deutsche BA, the airline's 49 per cent owned German domestic carrier.
News of the sale of its food ingredients business left drinks group Allied
Domecq 7 lower at 591p, with some analysts slightly disappointed with the
Pounds 265m disposal price. Allied has two other disposals in hand, notably
its tea operations, which are said to have an asking price of Pounds 300m
and to have attracted Nestle among potential buyers.
Lonrho continued to gain ground. Up 14 on Friday following the announced
departure of joint chief executive Mr Tiny Rowland, the stock added 4 at 148
1/2 p. Turnover, at 10m shares, was again heavy.
Hotels and leisure group Forte slithered below the 227p price at which 78m
shares were placed on Friday, losing 7 at 226 1/2 p in turnover of 2m. A
sell note from BZW did most of the damage - the investment bank is unhappy
about a longer term potential financing squeeze at Forte. It predicts
slowing cash flow at a time when capital spending will be rising steeply.
Friday's Pounds 175m placing was undertaken to finance Forte's purchase of a
big stake in Meridien Hotels, a deal that BZW sees as a strong strategic
fit. There was talk, however, that the placing had not gone as smoothly as
UBS, the group's broker, would have liked.
Retail sector leader Marks and Spencer dipped slightly in modest volume
ahead of today's interim results, slipping 4 1/2 to 409 1/2 p with 2.8m
traded. Further solid profits progress is expected but most analytical
attention will be concentrated on the group's sales trends.
Some estimates for the growth of M&S cash sales go as high as 8 per cent but
6 per cent is probably nearer the consensus. Anything under 5 per cent could
cast a deep cloud over the sector since M&S is traditionally seen as the
industry bellwether.
Boots advanced 4 to 517p on talk of a buy recommendation from a leading
marketmaker.
Enthusiasm for the impending flotation of TeleWest, the UK's largest cable
company, prompted weakness in the rest of the telecommunications sector.
Investors were starting to liquidate assets in preparation and BT, the most
easily tradeable stock in the sector, shed 6 to 389p on 9.6m turnover.
Computer group Tadpole Technology climbed 20 to 423p after the company
announced sales details of a new portable personal computer.
Recently floated Filtronic Comtek gained 5 at 140p, a new high, as Fidelity
International declared a 5.9 per cent stake.
A block of 2.1m shares in Logica, representing around 3.4 per cent of the
software company, was placed in the market at 289p. Most of the shares were
sold on at 290p and the underlying stock finished a penny firmer at 296p.
