FT  21 JUL 94 / A breather for the funding laggards: A look at governments
struggling to finance their debt


   By CONNER MIDDELMANN


The recent bond market recovery has provided European governments with a
much needed opportunity to step up funding programmes that had become bogged
down in market turmoil and adverse yield movements.
Some governments - notably Germany - had cancelled auctions and fallen
behind with their funding programmes. Others had shifted funding to the less
volatile shorter maturities.
However, the improvement in sentiment eased the way this week for the German
government's first auction of 10-year bonds since September, raising DM10bn
(Pounds 4bn). Next week the UK will auction its first long-dated
conventional bond in six months. Since January, it has auctioned Pounds
10.5bn of 'exotic' instruments, such as convertible and floating-rate gilts
and shorter-dated bonds.
Altogether, the next four weeks are likely to see around Dollars 100bn
(Pounds 65.7bn) of new supply from the US, Japan, Germany, France, the UK
and Italy, as well as substantial issuance in Spain and Sweden. Indeed, the
heavy supply may limit the scope of the bond market recovery, especially as
some countries are lagging in their funding schedules.
Even before yesterday's wobble, the sustainability of the recovery was being
questioned. Some analysts were dismissing it as little more than a technical
bounce and remained concerned about investor demand. 'Is this a genuine
rally or just a correction in the bear market?' asked Mr Kirit Shah,
international bond strategist at First Chicago in London. 'I think it is the
latter.'
The recent rally began with investors switching into German bonds out of US
assets. Then US bonds and the dollar staged a cautious recovery, calming
world markets. Moreover, encouraging German money supply data revived hopes
that the Bundesbank would cut interest rates again.
Some bond dealers have also reported a cautious return by traditional bond
investors, who had abstained during the sell-off but were tempted by the
sharp rise in yields to buy again from the start of the third quarter.
Others, however, attribute the recent gains mainly to futures buying by
players seeking short-term capital gains, and warn that more retail buying
is needed to underpin the recovery. 'At the moment, most of the buying is
futures driven, with some increased buying by hedge funds,' said Mr Shah.
'To cite an old truism: supply is never a problem when there's adequate
demand,' said Mr Jan Loeys, European fixed-income strategist at JP Morgan.
Governments will want to ensure that this year's supply goes into firm hands
after last year's borrowing bonanza turned sour. 'They issued like mad last
year, but half the investors absorbing that supply weren't permanent
investors - they were in it for the short term,' said Mr Loeys. Early this
year, many of them took their profits.
Reliance on foreign capital made some markets particularly vulnerable to the
bears. About 48 per cent of Sweden's 1993 net borrowing was financed by
overseas buying of government bonds or foreign currency borrowing, and heavy
foreign sales this year have taken their toll.
As a result, some governments have started targeting domestic investors to
ensure more secure homes for their debt. France plans to launch a programme
this autumn to encourage private investment in government bonds. And the
Spanish Treasury earlier this week said it would sell three-year fixed and
floating-rate paper to domestic insurance companies and banks on August 2.
But although supply is not causing serious difficulties now, it may well do
so later in the year, warns Mr George Magnus, chief international economist
at SG Warburg Securities.
Indeed, the worries which plagued investors earlier this year could easily
return. For one, economic growth - while helping to slim government budget
deficits through higher tax revenues - will fuel fears of inflation and
higher interest rates. Even if the Bundesbank continues to cut interest
rates, traders will be increasingly worried that each cut will be the last.
Further threats to European bonds could come from the US, where interest
rate increases are feared.
Political risks abound, too. Jitters could surface, for instance, ahead of
Sweden's elections in September and its referendum over EU membership in
November, and ahead of the French presidential elections in early 1995. In
Italy, Spain and Belgium, with their fragile coalition governments, the
threat of government crisis is never far from investors' minds.
A snapshot of European governments' remaining bond issuance for the year,
scaled to gross domestic product, shows that supply pressures remain the
largest in Italy and Spain, according to Mr Loeys.
While Italy is fairly up-to-date with this year's schedule, it has so far
failed to fund any of next year's massive redemptions as originally planned.
Meanwhile, Spain issued few long-dated bonds during the first half of the
year, relying heavily on short-term funding. Some 60 per cent of its
borrowing so far this year has been channelled through treasury bills which
will have to be refinanced within the next 12 months, implying more supply
later this year and especially in 1995.
Supply pressures are relatively low at present in Belgium, which is slightly
ahead in its issuance calendar. However, it, too, has been borrowing heavily
at the short end of the yield curve implying heavy refinancing volumes not
far down the road.
Countries borrowing at the short end make themselves vulnerable to rising
short-term rates, which increase the cost of servicing their debt.
The UK is doing fairly well after last year's substantial pre-funding, and
has few redemptions to refinance. The French authorities have stuck doggedly
to their monthly funding schedule throughout the bond market turbulence -
though as a result French bonds substantially underperformed their German
counterparts.
But after yesterday's bout of profit taking, the big question remains: will
investors absorb the waves of supply to come later this year?
