THE INDIAN government approved foreign investment proposals worth Rs42.9bn
(Pounds 909m) between August 1991 and last December, more than eight times
the Rs5.3bn level in the August 1990-December 1991 period, before India
embarked on its liberalisation programme in July 1991, writes Shiraz Sidhva
in New Delhi.
According to the Ministry of Industry's annual report yesterday, as many as
1,520 foreign collaborations were approved in the latest period, including
692 approvals involving foreign equity of Rs39.9bn, more than 32 times the
foreign investment approvals of Rs1.2bn the last time.
The US continues to be the leading foreign investor in India, accounting for
Rs27.8bn or nearly 60 per cent of the total approved, according to the
Indian Investment Centre, a government organisation for the promotion of
foreign private investment. Other countries which committed investment are
Switzerland (Rs9.6bn), Japan (Rs6.5bn), Thailand (Rs3.7bn), the UK (Rs1.9bn)
and Germany (Rs1.8bn).
Officials say there has been a spurt in investment during the first three
months of 1993, despite the setback caused by riots and a series of bomb
blasts in Bombay.
