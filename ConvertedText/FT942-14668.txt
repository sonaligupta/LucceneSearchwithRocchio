FT  19 APR 94 / International Company News: Emerging markets lift Coca-Cola


   By FRANK MCGURTY


   NEW YORK


Coca-Cola yesterday said an 'exceptional' performance in emerging markets
helped it achieve an 18 per cent increase in net earnings in the first
quarter.
The results suggest the US company is regathering pace after several years
of lack-lustre growth.
The world's largest soft-drink company said strong sales in Poland and
China, as well as in such 'leading edge markets' as Mexico and Australia,
offset soft market conditions in the European Union and Japan.
For the first three months of the year, the company posted net income of
Dollars 521m, or 40 cents a share, against Dollars 442m, or 35 cents, in the
corresponding period of 1993.
Net operating revenues advanced 10 per cent to Dollars 3.35bn, compared with
Dollars 3.05bn a year earlier. The improvement was struck on a 7 per cent
worldwide gain in unit case volume, exceeding the company's projections.
The results overseas were particularly impressive in view of continuing
economic weakness in many important markets. International unit case volume
climbed by more than 6 per cent, due largely to a 33 per cent rise in
north-east Europe and in the Middle East.
By contrast, growth in the EU was an anaemic 2 per cent, with a 3 per cent
decline in the UK. In Japan, unit volume inched 1 per cent ahead.
The importance of the overseas markets, which account for 80 per cent of
Coca-Cola's revenues, was underlined by its performance in India, where the
company began operating at the end of last year for the first time since
1977. In the first quarter, it sold 12m cases.
In the US, sales volume jumped by 7 per cent, better than forecasts of
around 4 per cent.
The results were a little better than analysts had expected. However, after
early gains, the stock closed unchanged at Dollars 39 3/8.
