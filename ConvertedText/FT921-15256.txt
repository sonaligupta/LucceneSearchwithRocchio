FT  11 JAN 92 / International Company News: Oce expects profit of Fl 101m


   By REUTER


   VENLO


DUTCH photocopier maker Oce Van der Grinten expects 1991 net profits of
about Fl 101m (Dollars 32.5m), compared with Fl 85.7m in 1990.
Turnover last year rose 11 per cent to Fl 2.6bn, according to chairman Mr
Harry Pennings, Reuter reports from Venlo.
Previously, the company had said that it saw higher profits and turnover for
1991, but it had not specified any of the figures.
Mr Pennings said that both Oce's drawing room and office equipment divisions
contributed to the profit rise last year, while cost cutting improved
efficiency.
The same factors made Oce positive about its 1992 results, Mr Pennings
added.
Oce will publish its full 1991 results on February 18.
