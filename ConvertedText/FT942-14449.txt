FT  20 APR 94 / UK Company News: Boosey ahead and splits shares


   By DAVID BLACKWELL


Boosey & Hawkes, the instrument maker and music publisher, increased profits
by 3.6 per cent over 1993 and announced a 5-for-1 share split.
Pre-tax profits were Pounds 4.38m (Pounds 4.23m). Exchange gains of Pounds
250,000 helped to offset reorganisation costs of Pounds 530,000 incurred in
Japan, Germany and France.
Earnings per share were ahead 14 per cent at 76.8p (67.5p), following a tax
charge of Pounds 1.38m (Pounds 1.58m). The lower charge of 31.5 per cent
(37.4 per cent) resulted from the utilisation of tax losses in Germany, the
UK and the US and was not expected to be repeated this year.
A final dividend of 19p is proposed, giving a total for the year of 25p
(22p).
The shares yesterday closed at Pounds 12.75p, up 12p on the day. Mr Richard
Holland, chief executive, said the board was proposing the split as the
price was 'a bit weighty for a company this size'.
Mr Holland described the results as a considerable achievement in the face
of difficult market conditions, especially in Japan which accounts for 20
per cent of group sales.
Turnover rose from Pounds 59.4m to Pounds 66.5m through marginally higher
volumes and favourable exchange gains. The instrument division, which
accounted for 80 per cent of turnover, suffered a slight fall in operating
profits after the reorganisation charge.
In January the group, which makes mainly brass and woodwind instruments,
paid Pounds 390,000 for Karl Hofner, a German string instrument and guitar
maker with annual sales of DM10m (Pounds 4m). Mr Holland said the
acquisition would strengthen the group's position in the instrument market.
Sales of Gorecki's Symphony No 3 continue to help the publishing division,
which also has Rakhmaninov, Britten and Stravinsky on its books. The group
expects the EU's lengthening of the term of copyright from next year to 70
years from the death of a composer to bring long-term benefits.
Publishing turnover rose by 16 per cent to Pounds 13.6m, and operating
profit by 12 per cent to Pounds 4.3m.
Group borrowings fell by Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 13.2m, giving gearing of 58
per cent (68 per cent).
