FT  15 JUN 93 / Uruguay tackles row over officer


   By JOHN BARHAM

REPORTS that South American security forces worked together last year to
'rescue' a Chilean intelligence officer, wanted in connection with human
rights investigations in Chile, have set off political trouble in Uruguay,
where the officer was last seen.
The affair came to light last week when Uruguayan congressmen received an
anonymous letter claiming that Argentine, Chilean and Uruguayan intelligence
services co-operated last November, apparently without the knowledge of
their civilian political masters, to spirit Mr Eugenio Berros out of Chile,
where he was wanted on human rights charges. He is alleged to have been
implicated in rights violations during General Augusto Pinochet's military
regime of 1973-1990.
Mr Berros was taken first to Argentina, then to Uruguay, where he is
believed to have been protected by army and police officers. He has since
disappeared without trace.
Uruguayan President Luis Alberto Lacalle cut short last week an official
visit to London to deal with the affair. He sacked General Mario Aguerrondo
as head of military intelligence and Mr Ramon Rivas, the police chief
suspected of holding Mr Berros in the town of Parque del Plata.
However, Mr Lacalle has been careful to avoid a head-on confrontation with
the Uruguayan military, which has evaded the sort of human rights
investigations that dogged the armed forces of Argentina, Brazil, Chile and
Paraguay after they handed back power to civilians.
Mr Lacalle has ordered a confidential interior and defence ministry
investigation of the Berros affair, rather than a full judicial inquiry. He
stressed at the weekend that the affair was mainly a Chilean problem, with
ramifications in Uruguay.
