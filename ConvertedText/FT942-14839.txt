FT  19 APR 94 / Thais invite Burma to Asean


   By WILLIAM BARNES


   BANGKOK


Mr Prasong Soonsiri, Thailand's foreign minister, flies to Burma today to
invite Rangoon's military regime to attend the Association of South-East
Asian Nations ministerial meeting in July, William Barnes writes from
Bangkok.
Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines have been persuaded to set aside
'reservations' that such an invitation to a widely reviled administration
could disrupt the organisation's relations with its western trading
partners.
Asean ministerial meetings are followed by a regional forum and then
meetings with its seven 'dialogue partners' - the US, European Union,
Australia, Canada, South Korea, Japan and New Zealand. Burma will probably
be invited as a guest of the host, Thailand, rather than - more
significantly - as a guest of Asean.
