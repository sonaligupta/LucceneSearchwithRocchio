FT  20 APR 94 / New offensive reported in north of republic

   BELGRADE


With the Bosnian Serb army poised to partition Gorazde, the Moslem enclave
in southeastern Bosnia, media reports in Serbia have begun to warn of a new
offensive to the north.
Both the Moslems and Croats, on one side, and the Serbs, on the other, have
high stakes in the strategic Posavina, the Sava river valley, spanning
northern Bosnia.
Belgrade radio yesterday repeated a claim that a 'Moslem offensive was under
way on all fronts' in Bosnia. It accused the Bosnian government of aiming to
wrest land from Serb forces in northern Bosnia, where Serb forces have
carved out a corridor linking Belgrade to Serb-held territory in Bosnia and
Croatia.
Vecernje Novosti, Serbia's most popular newspaper, warned of 'hellish
battles' in a 10-day Moslem offensive at Brcko, towards the eastern end of
the corridor. It also described 'constant infantry attacks' in the region.
The reports could not be confirmed. In the past, Serb offensives have been
preceded by charges of Moslem attacks.
Independent analysts in Belgrade believe the Bosnian army, if backed by the
Croats, could benefit by attacking Serb positions round Brcko. It is at
Brcko where the Serb army is at its most vulnerable. Its land corridor is
only about 10km at its widest and could be severed by a Croat and Moslem
offensive from the north and south.
However while Mr Gojko Susak, Croatia's defence minister, remains in office,
the Moslem-led Bosnian government is unlikely to take seriously Croatia's
commitment to respect Bosnia's borders and will shrink from launching an
offensive with them against the Serbs. Mr Susak was behind Croatia's drive
to divide Bosnia-Hercegovina with Serbia.
Reports of Moslem offensives could herald the next episode in the Serb quest
to carve out their own state in the ruins of Bosnia.
