FT  25 MAY 93 / International Company News: Solvay may be forced to close
soda ash factory

FIERCE competition from the US and central and eastern Europe could force
Solvay, the Belgian chemicals company, to cut up to 10 per cent of its soda
ash production capacity this year - including the closure of its first soda
ash plant in Belgium.
Solvay, which last month warned that 1993 earnings would fall steeply, has
lodged formal complaints with the European Commission against alleged
'dumping' of cheap natural US soda ash on the EC market, and asked for
measures to protect the industry from cheap Polish, Bulgarian and Romanian
imports.
Solvay said yesterday it would have to stop production at its 129-year-old
Couillet plant in Belgium this year. Losses at the plant had grown to an
'unacceptable' BFr800m (Dollars 23.95m) a year, despite repeated attempts to
reduce fixed costs. The group is also considering the closure of its
Heilbronn soda ash factory in west Germany.
Up to 540 jobs could be lost at the factories, although sodium silicate and
calcium chloride activities will be maintained at Couillet. Last year, the
group cut 1,700 jobs and a spokesman said yesterday that at least the same
number would be lost this year.
Solvay said US and east European imports of 800,000 tonnes a year accounted
for more than 13 per cent of total EC consumption of soda ash, which is used
in the production of glass, detergent, soap, adhesives and paint. Solvay,
which pioneered the production of man-made soda ash, is the largest
producer, but recession and overcapacity have hit the industry.
Excluding extraordinary items, Solvay's net consolidated profits fell 14 per
cent last year, to BFr8.41bn from BFr9.79bn. In the alkalis sector,
including soda ash, earnings before interest, tax and charges slipped to
BFr5.6bn from BFr6.13bn.
