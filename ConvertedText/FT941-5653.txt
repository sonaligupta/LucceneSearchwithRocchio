FT  05 MAR 94 / US angered by arrest of Chinese dissident


   By GEORGE GRAHAM


   WASHINGTON


The US yesterday issued a strong protest against China's arrest of a
prominent dissident, warning that it would 'cast a pall over the planned
visit' to Beijing next week of Mr Warren Christopher, the US Secretary of
State.
President Bill Clinton said the US strongly disapproved of the arrest, which
he described as 'certainly not a helpful action.'
Mr Wei Jingsheng, who was released last September after 14 years in prison,
was detained yesterday after meeting last week with Mr John Shattuck, a
senior US human rights envoy.
The arrest of Mr Wei, who was a leader of the Democracy Wall movement in
1978-79 and is probably the Chinese dissident who is best known outside
China, seems certain to impair the chances of Mr Clinton deciding to renew
China's most favoured nation trading privileges in June.
Four other leading dissidents were also reported to have been detained.
Mr Clinton last year extended China's MFN status for one year, on condition
that it meet US demands for free emigration and an end to the use of prison
labour in exported goods, and make progress in other areas such as the
release of political prisoners, the protection of Tibetan culture and
allowing outside radio broadcasts.
While Clinton administration officials have indicated some encouragement at
the steps the Chinese government was taking, they have also repeatedly
warned that China has not yet done enough to fend off revocation of MFN in
June.
