FT  29 JAN 92 / Letter: A right way to beat exhaustion


   From Mr DENNIS RICHARDSON


Sir, Why do most motor vehicles in the UK have the exhaust pipe positioned
on the near side? This causes inconvenience and near-asphyxiation to people
on the pavement when there is a slow-moving line of traffic.
If all right-hand drive vehicles had the exhaust pipe on the off side the
gases would be expelled into the middle of the road, which would be more
acceptable to pedestrians.
Manufacturers, please note.
