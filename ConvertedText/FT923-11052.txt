FT  27 JUL 92 / Secret services face scrutiny


   By DAVID OWEN


MR RICHARD CABORN, the new chairman of the all-party Commons trade and
industry committee, is to raise the question of the accountability of the
intelligence services with Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, adding to pressure on the government to open the service to
parliamentary scrutiny.
Mr Caborn, Labour MP for Sheffield Central, plans to write to Mr Heseltine
addressing the subject in the context of the Iraqi supergun affair.
He will ask Mr Heseltine whether the government intends to respond to the
committee's assertion in a recent report that the affair 'raises serious and
important questions about the accountability of the intelligence services
both to ministers and to parliament'.
A slim response from the DTI to the report contained no reference to the
committee's claim.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, has signalled that he is looking at ways
of making the secret services more accountable as part of his commitment to
more open government.
Top of the committee's new agenda is UK trade with the European Community -
a topic which it will begin to examine, along with the aerospace sector and
domestic energy pricing, when parliament returns in October.
The committee will aim in particular to assess claims made in
representations to the government that European continuous-process
industries such as steel and chemicals benefit from hidden subsidies in the
form of cheap energy.
Consideration is being given to inviting Sir Leon Brittan and Mr Bruce
Millan, the two British EC commissioners, to appear as witnesses.
In deference to the Energy Department's absorption by the DTI, the committee
has agreed informally to devote about a quarter of its time to energy
issues.
Mr Caborn is also considering devising some form of continuous monitoring of
the DTI's performance, although thinking on this is at a preliminary stage.
