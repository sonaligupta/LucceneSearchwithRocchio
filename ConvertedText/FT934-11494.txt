THE leaders of four German states (Lander) are to meet the chief executives
of Daimler-Benz and its subsidiary Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) to try to head
off mass redundancies and plant closures by Germany's principal aerospace
contractor.
The meeting, at the initiative of Mr Edmund Stoiber, the Bavarian prime
minister, is on November 12. It will bring together Mr Edzard Reuter of
Daimler-Benz, Mr Jurgen Schrempp, his colleague at Dasa, as well as Mr
Gerhard Schroder, the premier of Lower Saxony, Mr Stoiber, and the mayors of
the city states of Bremen and Hamburg.
All the states have important Dasa plants, several involved in manufacture
of the European Airbus and now threatened with closure in the drastic
rationalisation programme announced by Mr Schrempp last week. The company is
to shed 16,000 jobs from its 80,000-strong workforce by the end of 1996, and
close six plants, while seeking outside buyers for three further plants.
The biggest plants affected are the Airbus Lemwerder works outside Bremen,
with 1,150 expected redundancies, and the Airbus factory at Munich-Neuabing,
with 1,200 job losses.
Both Bavaria and Lower Saxony have offered subsidies to keep the plants
open, but Dasa insists it has no plans to amend its cuts.
