FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Tiphook's shares rise on container sale
completion


   By ANDREW BOLGER


Shares in Tiphook rose by 5p to 55p yesterday after the debt-laden transport
leasing group confirmed the completion of the sale of its container business
to Transamerica, the US financial services group, writes Andrew Bolger.
Proceeds of Pounds 673m were received yesterday by Tiphook, which could
receive a further Pounds 49m from the deal.
The final consideration depends on changes in the net assets of the
container operations between September 30 and yesterday, and is subject to a
completion audit.
Tiphook, which had debts of more than Pounds 1bn, had warned that its
survival depended on the successful disposal.
Completion of the sale was conditional on consents by a majority of the
group's US bondholders.
