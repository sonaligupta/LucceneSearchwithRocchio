FT  27 SEP 94 / International Company News: Shougang surges to HKDollars
103m


   By LOUISE LUCAS


Shougang Concord International Enterprises Company, the mainland metals
conglomerate listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange, has reported a surge in
first-half net profits of 920 per cent to HKDollars 103.19m (USDollars
13.32m).
The profits were struck on a turnover of HKDollars 2.9bn, 262 per cent up on
the HKDollars 805.4m of the same period last year.
Mr Zhou Beifang, chairman, said the metals trading business performed
impressively but was held back by construction materials, where keen
competition prompted losses.
Basic earnings per share rose 176.7 per cent to 8.3 cents. Shareholders are
to receive an interim dividend of 2.5 cents.
Shougang Concord Grand, formerly Kader Investment and about to come under
the control of Shougang International, recorded a fall of 35 per cent in
first-half net earnings to HKDollars 20.5m from HKDollars 31.6m. It is
recommending a dividend of 1.5 cents. Earnings per share, on a fully diluted
basis, fell 37 per cent to 2.8 cents from 4.43 cents.
