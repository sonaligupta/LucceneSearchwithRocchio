FT  29 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Reorganisation costs hit Eliza Tinsley


Reduced pre-tax profits of Pounds 510,000 were reported by Eliza Tinsley
Group, the USM-quoted hardware products company, for the year to March 31.
Profits last time were Pounds 830,000.
Turnover edged ahead to Pounds 15.7m (Pounds 15.3m), generating operating
profits of Pounds 1.01m (Pounds 970,000).
The pre-tax result was after exceptional reorganisation and redundancy costs
of Pounds 342,000 as a result of integrating the distribution activities of
Griffin with those of Eliza Tinsley and transferring the manufacturing
activities carried out at Reddal Hill Road to JT Parkes.
Mr Edward Jeynes, chairman, said he expected benefits of the reorganisation
to start coming through in the current year.
An unchanged final dividend of 3.4p is proposed for a maintained 5.2p total.
Earnings per share dropped to 4.72p (8.02p).
