FT  23 APR 93 / UK Company News: Newarthill cuts losses to Pounds 21.5m


LOSSES AT Newarthill, the family-controlled holding company for the civil
engineer Sir Robert McAlpine, were halved from Pounds 42.8m to Pounds 21.5m
in the year to October 31.
Turnover fell to Pounds 267.8m (Pounds 463.6m). The loss was Pounds 11.8m
(Pounds 15.7m) to which was added provision for loss in partnership
development Pounds 5.56m (Pounds 25m), redundancy costs Pounds 2.99m (Pounds
2.13m), Australian restructuring costs Pounds 430,000 and exchange
differences Pounds 708,000.
Directors said the core business held up satisfactorily, returning a trading
profit before the exceptional costs of slimming down the organisation.
In the current year the group had obtained new contracts above targeted
expectation, with an increasing percentage of civil engineering work, and
was continuing to receive 'a healthy volume' of inquiries.
