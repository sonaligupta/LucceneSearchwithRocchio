FT  23 APR 93 / Customs 'lax' over tax avoidance


   By ANDREW JACK


CUSTOMS and Excise has taken insufficient measures to deal with tax
avoidance, the Commons public accounts committee said yesterday, Andrew Jack
writes.
In a report it said the department has little information on the incidence
and tax at risk from avoidance of payment.
It expressed concern that Customs had not done enough to monitor the
effectiveness of measures on tax avoidance. It criticised the lack of
central coordination of Customs' work in countering avoidance and stressed
that the department had acknowledged that the arrangements were inadequate.
Customs said it had created a headquarters team to improve coordination on
tax avoidance, and was meeting traders and improving training and guidance
in local offices to deal with the topic.
It dismissed suggestions that traders might be forced to pay assessments
under pressure from officials.
