FT  02 NOV 93 / World Commodities Prices: Tea


Landed north Indians met good competition with best liquoring sorts
irregular and coloury mediums fully firm and often dearer, reports the Tea
Brokers' Association. Plainer lines were about steady. Selected best
liquoring east Africans held values but others were 10 to 15p down,
sometimes more. Mediums were, on the other hand, well supported at last
rates. Brighter Ceylons were occasionally dearer with the remainder firm.
Offshore: continuing good demand at last rates. Quotations: quality 200p/kg,
good medium 140p/kg, medium 122p/kg, low medium 103p/kg. The highest price
realised this week was 236p/kg for a Rwanda pf. 1.
