FT  02 NOV 93 / Technology: Science turns to ancient diets


   By CLIVE COOKSON


Archaeologists and water scientists are joining forces to identify the diet
and diseases of people living thousands of years ago, by studying their
semi-fossilised faeces.
The Institute of Archaeology at University College, London, is working with
Thames Water's Spencer House laboratory in Reading to develop the new gene
amplification technique of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for use on
'paleo-faeces'.
According to Mark Spigelman of the Institute of Archaeology, these are quite
common in dry parts of the world.
'In the southwestern US, there are cave-fulls of the stuff,' he says. 'My
oldest specimen is from a 19,000-year-old campsite in Egypt.'
Spigelman, who has already used PCR to find traces of tuberculosis bacteria
in ancient skeletons, believes that paleo-faeces contain enough surviving
genetic material (DNA) to be detected by the technique.
He hopes to identify fragments of genes both from disease-causing bacteria
and from the plants and animals in the ancient diet.
Colin Fricker, Thames Water microbiology manager, has an obvious
professional interest in identifying traces of human faeces, in order to
test water quality.
'We have been developing new methods of detecting E. coli, a bacterium found
in faeces, for some time, so it was an incentive to improve the sensitivity
and accuracy of these tests,' he says.
The latest PCR test for E. coli, developed by Thames Water, picks out a
bacterial gene for an enzyme called beta-glucuronidase.
The scientists plan first to look for this gene in ancient faeces and then
move on to others.
Recent experiments have shown that the DNA molecule is far more robust than
scientists had imagined a decade or so ago.
PCR has recently been used to extract and amplify traces of genetic material
from insects trapped in amber more than 100m years old.
