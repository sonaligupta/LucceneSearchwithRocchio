FT  12 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading


   By PETER JOHN


Stock index futures rallied sharply yesterday, pulling the underlying cash
market upwards as investors shrugged off some of their concern that interest
rates might be on the turn, writes Peter John.
The FT-SE 100 contract expiring in June opened the new account at 3,129, up
from Friday's finish, and maintained the firm tone throughout the day,
hitting a high of 3,164 before reaching an official trading close of 3,158.
At that level it was about six points above its estimated fair value premium
of around seven points, which has been recalculated for the new account.
Traders said there was support from Salomon Brothers International and
NatWest Securities, as well as 'locals', or independent traders. One
enthusiastic dealer commented: 'The future has been fat all day' but it was
thriving on junk food - turnover of less than 10,000 contracts suggested
that the fundamental support in the market was thin.
Traded options, meanwhile, saw only 29,000 contracts traded, busier than
Friday's desultory level which saw only 21,766 lots changing hands but still
uninspiring. Among stock options, Glaxo ended the day as the most active
with 3,310 lots dealt, followed by BT with 2,542 and Lucas with 1,644. Shell
Transport and Rolls-Royce were also heavily traded.
