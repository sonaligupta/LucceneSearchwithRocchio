FT  28 SEP 94 / Cancer charity's donations down


The Imperial Cancer Research Fund yesterday announced job losses and cuts in
cancer research, after a fall in donations.
To meet a 1995-96 spending limit of about Pounds 54m - Pounds 6.5m less than
originally planned - it is closing research centres in Bristol and London
and cutting back significantly in Dundee and Oxford. About 30 of the fund's
1,600 staff could be made redundant.
The charity relies on donations to carry on its work and legacies make up
about 71 per cent of its voluntary income. In recent years legacy income has
gone up by on average 15 per cent a year, but last year saw a slowing in
growth and this year there has been a fall of nearly Pounds 2m.
Sir Walter Bodmer, director-general, said: 'There is now more competition
among charities than in the past for this type of income.'
