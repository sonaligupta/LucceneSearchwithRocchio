FT  30 JUN 93 / Breakdown of pay talks with FBU


   By LISA WOOD


MR MIKE CANN, a representative of the fire brigades employers, and Mr Ken
Cameron, general secretary of the FBU firefighters' union, yesterday after
the breakdown of pay talks. The threat of a national firefighters strike
receded, however, after the union's leaders said they would consult with
members before any decision was taken on holding a strike ballot, Lisa Wood
writes. Employers' representatives told the union that the pay formula -
introduced to settle a nine-week national strike 15 years ago - would be
suspended in November because of the government's 1.5 per cent ceiling on
public-sector pay. But they said they would guarantee the formula's
re-instatement next year. The formula links earnings to the upper quartile
of full-time male manual workers' pay. The employers rejected a proposal by
the union to pay 1.5 per cent in November and then make a top-up to the
formula-linked award in April.
Mr Cameron said that after consultations with members a delegates'
conference would be held in the summer to decide whether to call a strike
ballot.
