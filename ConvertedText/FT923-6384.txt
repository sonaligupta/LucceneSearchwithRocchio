This week's Hollywood Great (Channel 4, 10.20) is Michael Caine. In a way he
is a link with the stars of the 1930s and 40s in being a presence rather
than a great actor. He is always Michael Caine playing a role and in his
drive for financial security too many have been beneath his status. But he
deserves tonight's accolade for the rare occasions when he shines above his
material, notably in Woody Allen's Hannah and Her Sisters when he acted the
bigger artistic names off the screen.
The John Bull Business (BBC 2,9.30) tackles the Big One  - the City of
London. At last some City figures are prepared to confront the Dollars
64,000 question  - does the City exist for the benefit of the nation or to
personally enrich its major protagonists? Even the government is wondering
whether the City's pursuit of short term gains as against long term
investment can be allowed to continue indefinitely.
For decades Spanish food remained a national secret. Now more restaurants
appreciate that visitors want local favourites and Floyd on Spain (BBC 2 at
8.30) is particularly timely as this week he tours the Basque country.
