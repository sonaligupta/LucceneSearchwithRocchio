FT  24 MAR 92 / International Company News: Volvo goes to Procordia for new
chief executive


   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry correspondent


VOLVO has appointed Mr Soren Gyll as chief executive to replace Mr Christer
Zetterberg, who has headed Volvo since April 1990, writes Kevin Done, Motor
Industry correspondent.
Mr Gyll, chief executive of Procordia, the Swedish pharmaceutical and foods
group, would move to Volvo whether or not the planned merger of Volvo and
Procordia takes place, the car and truck group said yesterday.
The appointment of Mr Gyll is a severe blow to the fortunes of Mr Christer
Zetterberg, who is to be relegated to the post of deputy chief executive,
according to a statement yesterday.
Mr Zetterberg, formerly president and chief executive of PKBanken, the
Swedish state-owned bank, was expected eventually to succeed Mr Pehr
Gyllenhammar, the Volvo chairman. But the relationship between the two has
proved difficult.
The fate of the proposed SKr38.7bn (Dollars 6.5bn) merger of Volvo and
Procordia remains uncertain. The Swedish government, which owns 42.7 per
cent of the voting rights in Procordia, blocked the merger in January but is
still discussing alternative solutions.
Mr Zetterberg said last week that the talks had entered a decisive phase and
that a settlement would probably be announced in one to two weeks. He
refused to predict the outcome.
When the deal was announced in January, the two companies said that Mr
Gyllenhammar would become chairman of the merged group with Mr Gyll as
president and chief executive officer. Mr Zetterberg was to become deputy
chief executive responsible for Volvo's vehicle operations.
The appointment of Mr Gyll by the Volvo board, regardless of the outcome of
the merger negotiations, has renewed speculation that Mr Zetterberg will
shortly leave Volvo, however, possibly to return to the Swedish pulp and
paper industry.
