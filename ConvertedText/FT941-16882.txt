FT  07 JAN 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Making safe glass for outer
space


   By ANDREW FISHER


Out in space, debris is accumulating, writes Andrew Fisher. High velocity
particles of 'space junk' - from obsolete satellites and rocket stages, for
example - orbit the earth and menace manned missions.
In Freiburg, Germany, the Fraunhofer Institute is testing special samples of
glass, as used in observation windows in the Russian MIR space station, in a
joint venture with Deutsche Aerospace. Using high-speed cameras, researchers
analyse the effects of impacts at high velocity for use in the future design
of spacecraft components. Fraunhofer Institute for High Speed Dynamics:
