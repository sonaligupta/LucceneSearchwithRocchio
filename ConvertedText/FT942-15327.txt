FT  15 APR 94 / International Company News: L'Oreal bolsters position with
12.5% profits rise


   By ALICE RAWSTHORN


L'Oreal last year reinforced its position as the world's largest cosmetics
company with a 12.5 per cent increase in net profits to FFr2.59bn (Dollars
440m) from FFr2.3bn in 1992.
The group, which owns a range of beauty brands including Lancome cosmetics,
Giorgio Armani fragrances and Ambre Solaire sun products, succeeded in
maintaining profits growth despite the sluggish state of the international
cosmetics market.
The company described conditions last year as 'difficult' and said the
market was 'still depressed' this year. However, he added that L'Oreal had
increased its first-quarter sales by between 5 per cent and 6 per cent.
Consolidated sales rose by 6.9 per cent to FFr40.16bn in 1993 from
FFr37.57bn in 1992. Managed sales, including the contribution from Cosmair,
the North American marketing arm which is to be consolidated into L'Oreal's
accounts, rose by 9.2 per cent to FFr50.9bn from FFr46.6bn.
Operating profits increased by 12.9 per cent to FFr4.66bn from FFr4.13bn.
Earnings per share rose by 12.5 per cent to FFr44.42 from FFr39.50. The
board proposed an increase in the net dividend to FFr10.80 for 1993 from
FFr9.60 in 1992.
