FT  14 APR 94 / UK Company News: Smiths turns in Pounds 46m midway - Advance
achieved despite depressed conditions in aerospace market


   By DAVID WIGHTON


Smiths Industries reported a recovery in pre-tax profits from Pounds 40.3m
to Pounds 46m on turnover up by Pounds 23.2m to Pounds 351m in the six
months to January 29, in spite of depressed conditions for its aerospace
business.
Mr Roger Hurn, chairman and chief executive, said that the production phase
of several defence projects had been delayed and that the prospects for the
aerospace arm remained difficult.
But he declared himself 'optimistic' about the outlook for growth in group
profits and earnings per share.
Both the medical systems and industrial divisions reported higher profits,
partly due to acquisitions, and earnings per share rose from 9.2p to 10.4p.
The interim dividend rises 7 per cent to 4.6p.
Excluding a Pounds 3m exceptional loss in the first half of last year
pre-tax profits rose by 6 per cent, with about half the rise the result of
acquisitions. Mr Hurn said he was 'delighted' with the performance of
Vent-Axia, the fans and hand driers maker bought for Pounds 56m in December
1992.
Its inclusion increased profits from the industrial division to Pounds 11.7m
(Pounds 8.6m) on turnover of Pounds 84.7m (Pounds 68.4m).
Profits from aerospace edged up to Pounds 14.1m (Pounds 13.9m) on flat sales
of Pounds 174m. The aerospace workforce, which is down by 40 per cent from
its peak, was cut by another 600 in the period.
There were a total of 750 redundancies across the group in the first half
with costs, charged against profits, at a similar level to last year.
The shares rose 15p to 485p.
Smiths paid out Pounds 9m in deferred acquisition costs in the first half,
but its net cash still grew from Pounds 34m to Pounds 62m, before the recent
Dollars 32m (Pounds 21.9m) purchase of Tutco in the US. Mr Hurn said the
group was looking for further acquisitions.
COMMENT
As the aerospace recovery continues to recede, more of Smiths' staff are
shown the door. But the company believes that process is largely over,
convincing the more cautious observers that its aerospace profits have
bottomed in spite of the expected downturn in orders for the Boeing 737.
Although kit for the new 777 will kick in from next year, Smiths will not
know until September how much work it will get for the updated 737-700.
Given the heavily reduced cost-base, a reasonable upturn in workload should
bring a sharp upturn in profits. But until that happens Smiths' can only
look to some recovery from its industrial division, where margins are
already a healthy 14 per cent, and continued expansion from medical, where
underlying profits growth was between 6 and 8 per cent in the first half.
That should take profits to about Pounds 113m this year, but after a strong
run the shares look high enough on 19 times earnings.
