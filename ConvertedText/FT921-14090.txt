FT  17 JAN 92 / Largest mortgage lenders cut rates by 1/2 point


   By DAVID BARCHARD and PETER NORMAN


THE THREE largest UK mortgage lenders yesterday unexpectedly lowered their
rates to borrowers in an effort to revive Britain's depressed housing
market.
Abbey National, the second largest lender, led the way by reducing its main
mortgage interest rate from 11.55 per cent to 10.99 per cent for mortgages
below Pounds 60,000.
The move - matched within hours by Halifax and Nationwide - was welcomed by
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor. 'Lower mortgage rates, combined with the
stamp duty cut, will help to increase activity in the housing market,
benefiting home-buyers and home-owners throughout the country,' he said.
Monthly savings as a result of the cuts will be about Pounds 20 on a Pounds
50,000 endowment mortgage and around Pounds 10 on a Pounds 120,000 loan.
The government introduced legislation on Wednesday to remove stamp duty from
all house purchases under Pounds 250,000 before August 19. In addition, some
2.6m borrowers whose mortgage rates are fixed annually stand to benefit from
earlier mortgage reductions in the next few months.
Yesterday's news brought mixed reactions in the City where shares rose
slightly on the announcement by Abbey National.
Mr Peter Spencer, UK economist for Shearson Lehman Brothers, the US-owned
securities house, predicted that the cuts would have 'a catalytic effect' on
the housing market because most people had thought that mortgage rates were
no longer falling. 'It's not so much the pounds and pence but the
psychological impact,' he said.
Single figure mortgage rates were now a possibility later this year, he
added.
But Mr John Wriglesworth, housing finance analyst at stockbroker UBS
Phillips & Drew, expressed serious doubts that the cut would revive the
market. 'This is not sufficient to provide the necessary kick-start that the
housing market definitely needs,' he said.
Mr David Holland, chief executive of Wimpey Homes, said the cut was
excellent news and could be just what the housing market needed to get
moving again.
Mortgage rates have now come down seven times in the past 16 months and are
around their lowest for almost four years. Yesterday's move was the first
time that lenders have cut their interest rates without a cut in base rates
by the government.
Their action reflects the ability of the lenders to finance their operations
through deposits from savers. However, Halifax, Britain's biggest mortgage
lender with 1.8m borrowers, warned that it would have to raise its new base
mortgage rate of 10.95 per cent if the government increased base rates from
their current 10.5 per cent level.
Building society rates to savers are set to fall during February to match
the lower rates to borrowers.
Other mortgage lenders, including the clearing banks, said they were
reviewing rates.
Abbey National said rates on mortgages of up to Pounds 60,000 would drop
0.56 points to 10.99 per cent. Rates for loans of between Pounds 60,000 and
Pounds 100,000 go down 0.3 points to 10.55 per cent and mortgages over
Pounds 100,000 are reduced 0.2 points to 10.4 per cent.
Halifax said rates on mortgages under Pounds 60,000 would fall 0.45 points
to 10.95 per cent. Rates on mortgages between Pounds 60,000 and Pounds
100,000 would fall to 10.5 per cent from 10.85 per cent, while on mortgages
over Pounds 100,000 the rate would fall 0.2 points to 10.3 per cent.
Nationwide cut 0.51 points off mortgages up to Pounds 60,000 to 10.99 per
cent. For mortgages between Pounds 60,000 and Pounds 120,000 the rate is cut
0.25 points to 10.55 per cent , while over Pounds 120,000 the rate is cut
0.1 points to 10.4 per cent.
