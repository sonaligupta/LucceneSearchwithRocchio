FT  05 JUN 92 / Hidden evidence deprived Judith Ward of fair trial


   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent


THREE senior government forensic scientists 'took the law into their own
hands' and concealed evidence that could have cleared Miss Judith Ward of
IRA bombing charges at her trial 18 years ago, the Court of Appeal said
yesterday.
The court was giving judgment at the end of Miss Ward's appeal against
conviction for the M62 army coach bombing, in which 12 people died, and two
other explosions. Lord Justice Steyn said: 'On the scientific evidence
deployed against her, Miss Ward did not have a fair trial.'
Mr Douglas Higgs, the late Mr Walter Elliott and Mr George Berryman, all
employed by the Royal Armament Research and Development Establishment,
withheld material evidence that might have changed the course of the trial,
he said. They misled 'the prosecution and the defence in order to promote a
cause which they had made their own, namely that Miss Ward had been in
contact with nitroglycerine'.
The court formally quashed her convictions as 'unsafe and unsatisfactory'.
West Yorkshire police, who investigated the M62 bombing, Director of Public
Prosecution staff and counsel advising them, psychiatrists who provided
evidence about Miss Ward and the forensic scientists for the prosecution
were all heavily criticised by the court for withholding evidence.
Miss Ward was freed on bail three weeks ago after the Crown conceded that
her confessions and scientific evidence purporting to show that she had
handled explosives were unreliable.
Mrs Barbara Mills QC, the DPP, said afterwards: 'Disclosure is in the
forefront of prosecutors' minds. The public is rightly concerned, but the
circumstances and atmosphere of 18 years ago were quite different.'
The Home Office said it would study the judgment before deciding what
action, if any, should be taken against the government scientists.
