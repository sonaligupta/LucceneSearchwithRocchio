FT  17 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tory councils favoured, says Gould
 -Local Government Funding


   By RALPH ATKINS


MR MICHAEL HESELTINE, environment secretary, has rigged the allocation of
government grants to councils for 'naked party political advantage', Labour
said yesterday.
Tory shire councils are receiving bigger increases than Labour authorities
in revenue support grant, said Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary.
Higher grants will feed through into lower poll tax bills for 1992-93.
Mr Gould's complaint, amid the continuing phoney election war at
Westminster, marked Labour's determination to raise poll tax as a political
issue.
Mr Gould said a general election on April 9 would coincide with the sending
out of poll tax bills - at least from Labour authorities.
Mr Michael Portillo, local government minister, accused Labour of
'ludicrous' claims, pointing out that its figures covered only shires. The
three biggest grants went to non-Tory authorities, he said.
Mr Gould said the 'special help' given to Conservative-controlled Wandsworth
and Westminster councils had been 'an open scandal' for years. Mr Heseltine
was also allocating much of his inner-city and housing budgets 'on his
personal whim'.
The latest figures showed 'that the whole grants system has been rigged'.
A report by the Labour-dominated Local Government Information Unit compares
the standard spending assessments (SSAs) set by ministers for each local
authority according to a complex formula taking account of local needs.
On average, SSAs for Tory authorities will rise by 5.67 per cent in 1992-93,
the report says. Councils under independent or no overall control will see a
rise of 5.33 per cent.
Councils controlled by the Liberal Democrats will get 4.87 per cent and
Labour councils 3.92 per cent.
