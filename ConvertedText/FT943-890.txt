FT  27 SEP 94 / French bank to disclose losses

Credit Lyonnais, the French banking group, is expected today to unveil
losses of FFr4bn-FFr5bn (Pounds 480m-Pounds 600m) in delayed results for the
first half of 1994.
The losses are expected to be accompanied by substantial additional balance
sheet provisions against worsening bad loans on activities outside its
traditional lending base. The bank confirmed its board was due to meet today
after which the results are scheduled to be published.
The results were due for release last Thursday, but were delayed by an
apparent collapse in discussions between Credit Lyonnais and the government.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister, issued a statement suggesting he had
only been informed last Monday of the size of the bank's bad debts, which
could require additional provisions of up to FFr25bn.
Mr Alphandery stressed that the government would provide support to the
bank, although the Ministry of Finance and Economy publicly rejected some
speculative reports that there would be any immediate state aid of
FFr3bn-FFr4bn required.
Credit Lyonnais sources suggested that the group had sufficient capital to
exceed European minimum solvency requirements. The state is believed to be
continuing to press for accelerated sales of banking assets as well as other
parts of the group.
