FT  12 APR 94 / People: Finance moves


Richard Ryder, international telecommunications analyst, has left Salomon
Brothers and is heading for Swiss Bank Corporation to set up a new team of
analysts covering global telecommunications.
SBC lacks expertise in this area and has apparently been on the look-out for
a suitable candidate for a while. Ryder, 46, will be head of global
telecommunications research, working with a handful of analysts - still to
be appointed. The bank sees 'telecommunications and media as one of the
sectors which will have a great future'.
Ryder had a high profile at Salomon Brothers, his home for the last seven
years, where he was global co-ordinator of telecommunications research. He
points out that with some Dollars 40bn worth of telecoms issuance expected
in Europe as a result of privatisations over the next three years, the area
is 'a big apple to take a bite out of'.
