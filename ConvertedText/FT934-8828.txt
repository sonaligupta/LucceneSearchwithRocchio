FT  13 NOV 93 / Watchdog acts on press code


THE Press Complaints Commission moved yesterday to try to strengthen
self-regulation of the press by suggesting editors who breach the agreed
code of practice could be sacked.
The move came in the wake of the publication by the Sunday Mirror and the
Daily Mirror of pictures of the Princess of Wales in a gym.
The commission said it was seeking to ensure that all editors of national
newspapers have the clauses of the code written into their contracts.
