FT  27 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Trafalgar auction for rump of rights issue


   By ROBERT PESTON


Swiss Bank Corporation and Robert Fleming, the investment banking groups,
are likely to initiate a significant change in London stock market practices
later this week by holding an auction for the rump of Trafalgar House's
Pounds 355m rights issue.
Normally when a company makes a rights issue to raise new capital, any
shares not wanted by the company's existing shareholders are placed with
investment institutions at a price fixed by the company's stockbrokers.
However, SBC and Fleming are planning to import a technique used in the
Eurobond market by inviting investors to make bids in an open auction. The
banks believe that a higher price will be fetched for the shares than using
the traditional method.
A final decision about whether to go ahead with the auction will be taken
today. However, bankers said last night that it was likely to take place.
The change may not be universally popular among brokers and investment
institutions.
The stockbroker to an issue has traditionally placed the rump of an issue
with their best clients, cementing a relationship between the broker and
investors.
Placing the rump also avoids the risk that much of it will end up with
sub-underwriters and lead to a fall in the share price.
In an auction, if there were no bids, all the rump would go to the
sub-underwriters.
The stockbrokers to the Trafalgar issue are Cazenove, London's leading
corporate broker, and UBS Securities.
