FT  03 AUG 92 / Sarajevo sniper kills two orphans

A SNIPER killed two young children aboard a bus evacuating orphans from
Sarajevo at the weekend, while Moslem forces battled to break the Serb hold
on the besieged Bosnian capital, agencies report from Sarajevo.
The children were among 50 being taken from a local orphanage to meet German
officials in nearby Fojnica on their way to refuge in Germany. They had been
waiting for six days to be evacuated, unable to fly out because of heavy
fighting.
United Nations peacekeepers in Sarajevo denied being asked to escort the
bus, although the charity that organised the evacuation said such protection
had been requested.
A German official later said the children had reached a 'secure' town about
40km from Sarajevo. They would be moved to Split, in Croatia, today before
being flown to Germany.
The UN compound in the city was attacked yesterday when shrapnel from an
exploding mortar crashed through the headquarters building. Mr Mik
Magnusson, a UN spokesman, had earlier warned that Bosnian forces were
endangering peacekeepers by setting up weapons too close to their monitoring
positions.
A protest was also lodged with the Serbs for firing back at well-marked UN
positions, he said.
Throughout the weekend, Moslem and Serb forces traded conflicting claims of
military success around the city, each accusing the other of launching
offensives and each claiming to have beaten back attacks. Moslem forces have
been trying to capture hills used by Serb gun batteries to pound Sarajevo,
where 380,000 people are trapped.
In a BBC interview, Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic said the west should
arm Moslems to defend themselves against Serbs who outgun them. 'I ask
myself sometimes, does Europe known what is going on here?' he said. 'Do
those responsible in Europe really know about concentration camps, about the
mass killings (in Serb-held areas)?'
