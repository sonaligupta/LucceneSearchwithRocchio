FT  14 APR 94 / UK Company News: MAI sells insurance business


   By ALISON SMITH


MAI, the financial services, information and media group headed by Lord
Hollick, has sold the business of Safeguard Insurance to Hill House Hammond,
a subsidiary of Norwich Union, for about Pounds 6.4m cash.
HHH will take on about half Safeguard's 174 branches to add to its existing
network of 185 offices which are concentrated on market and small provincial
towns. It deals in a range of motor, household and general insurance.
It will interview all 900 or so Safeguard staff, but some job losses are
certain. The combined operation will probably total about 2,000 staff.
MAI will put the sale proceeds towards the cost of closing the other
branches. The net costs, together with the write-off of historic goodwill
totalling Pounds 18m, will be treated as an exceptional item in MAI's
accounts for the year to June 30 this year.
Safeguard lost Pounds 1m in the second half of last year, having been hit by
intense competition from direct telephone sales. It last made a profit in
1991. 'The sale represents a satisfactory exit for MAI from a lossmaking
business,' the company said.
