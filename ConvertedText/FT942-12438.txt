FT  29 APR 94 / GM triples profits to Dollars 1.6bn


   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent


General Motors of the US, the world's largest vehicle maker, more than
tripled its net profit in the first quarter to Dollars 1.6bn (excluding
one-off charges) from Dollars 513m in the same quarter a year ago.
Net income totalled Dollars 854m, however, after a Dollars 758m charge for a
change in accounting rules for the cost of benefits to former or laid-off
employees. GM turnover rose by 8.5 per cent to Dollars 37.5bn (Dollars
34.6bn).
The group, which is recovering from three years of heavy losses between 1990
and 1992, remains the highest-cost vehicle maker in the US behind Chrysler
and Ford.
Its financial performance is improving, however, helped by the strength of
new vehicle demand in the US and restructuring of its North American
automotive operations, which have suffered huge losses for the past four
years.
Mr Jack Smith, chief executive, said the group's performance in the first
quarter had been 'strong, reflecting continued cost-reduction efforts,
improved productivity and a strong vehicle market'. GM accumulated net
losses of Dollars 29.9bn in the three years from 1990-92 and recovered to a
net profit of Dollars 2.5bn last year.
The GM workforce was cut to 688,000 in the first quarter of 1994 from
732,000 a year ago.
The group's battered North American automotive operations achieved a net
profit of Dollars 511m, before one-off charges, in the first quarter, a
Dollars 681m turnround from a loss of Dollars 170m a year ago. After a
Dollars 708m charge for accounting changes it still suffered a net loss of
Dollars 197m, however.
Mr Smith said that the North American automotive operations were key to
rebuilding the balance sheet. They were still on track to profitability at
the net income level in the whole of 1994 but were short of the profit
margins 'we are looking for in a strong sales environment'.
GM retail sales of cars and light trucks in the US jumped 19.6 per cent in a
market which rose by 18.3 per cent.
GM, which is the most profitable carmaker in Europe, increased its profits
significantly in its international operations to Dollars 425m, against
Dollars 141m a year ago.
Profits were more than doubled year-on-year both in Europe and in Latin
America.
