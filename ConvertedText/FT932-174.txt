FT  30 JUN 93 / Doctors reject role as 'health police'


   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent


DOCTORS WOULD not act as the 'Department of Social Security health police'
when handling invalidity benefit claims, Dr Ian Bogle, chairman of the
British Medical Association general medical services committee, said
yesterday.
The BMA annual representative meeting in Torquay angrily condemned
government suggestions that an over-lenient approach by doctors was fuelling
a rapid growth in invalidity benefit expenditure - one of the areas
earmarked for possible savings in the government's long-term review of
social security spending.
During the last 10 years the number of people receiving the benefit has
risen from 700,000 to 1.5m. Expenditure has more than doubled in real terms
over the same period to Pounds 6bn a year and is likely to reach Pounds 8bn
by 1995-96. Ministers have said invalidity payments are one of the
fastest-growing social security benefits at a time when the nation's health
has been improving.
But the association conference adopted a motion rejecting government
assertions that general practitioners did not understand the criteria for
sickness certification in relation to fitness for work.
Dr Peter Holden, who moved the motion, said that there had been a government
whispering campaign suggesting that doctors were conniving with patients to
issue false sick notes.
There were many possible explanations for the increase in benefit claims,
the conference heard. Manufacturing industries that had once kept people
with sickness problems in light work could no longer provide this, while the
prime minister should be aware of the links between unemployment,
deprivation and sickness. Dr Holden received prolonged cheers when he
declared: 'I am a family doctor, not the SS of the DSS.'
