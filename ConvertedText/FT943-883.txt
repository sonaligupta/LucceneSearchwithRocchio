FT  27 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Automotive Products drops into Pounds 4.7m
loss


   By TIM BURT


Automotive Products, the motor components subsidiary of BBA, yesterday
reported a first-half loss following the parent company's decision to settle
a long-running patent infringement case for Pounds 13.1m.
The company, which traditionally issues a separate results statement to BBA,
made pre-tax losses of Pounds 4.7m in the six months to June 30, against
profits of Pounds 5.7m.
The figures were undermined by the payment earlier this year of Dollars
18.4m (Pounds 11.9m) to Tilton Engineering, the US company which sued
Automotive Products for manufacturing carbon racing clutches on which it
held patents.
Operating profits, meanwhile, were unchanged at Pounds 9.5m on flat turnover
of Pounds 121.2m (Pounds 119m).
Mr Peter Clappison, finance director of BBA, said the sluggish figures
disguised a general improvement in trading conditions and the success of
cost-cutting measures.
Although he highlighted 230 job cuts at the subsidiary, he made no mention
of the departure of Mr Peter Crawford, chief executive of the automotive
business, who left in July following a disagreement with Mr Roberto Quarta,
BBA chief executive.
