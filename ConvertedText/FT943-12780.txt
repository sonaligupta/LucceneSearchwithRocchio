FT  22 JUL 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool


Currency developments have tended to push up some prices in the wool sector
in Europe. There is not only a small recovery in the US dollar, but a
relatively greater strengthening in the Australian dollar. European
adjustments also tend to push up pricing for individual firms. Apart from
this, there is some business stirring in the processing sectors. Orders have
been coming through erratically, usually for small weights at low prices,
but occasionally enough has been sold to have an effect on the prices one or
two firms are quoting. This can apply in the British wool sector, where a
good auction is expected next week. There was again good demand for
stockpile wool, and the monthly quota under the Garnaut schedule has now
been practically absorbed for July, August and September.
