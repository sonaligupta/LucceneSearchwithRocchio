FT  22 OCT 94 / German interest rate hopes hit: September's money supply
growth continues deceleration


   By ANDREW FISHER


   FRANKFURT


Germany's money supply growth continued to decelerate in September, but not
by enough to encourage hopes of further interest rate cuts by the Bundesbank
over the next few weeks.
The closely watched M3 monetary indicator rose at an annualised rate of 7.7
per cent last month. Some economists had expected it to show a more marked
slowdown, now that the distortions which caused it to grow more sharply
earlier this year have been ironed out.
The latest M3 figure 'will reduce market hopes for a further rate cut,' said
Mr Stephen King, economist at James Capel in London. 'With relatively high
levels of capacity utilisation and strong export and investment growth,
there is no real case for rates to be reduced again in the current cycle.'
The Bundesbank last reduced rates in May by half a percentage point,
bringing the discount rate down to 4.5 per cent and the Lombard rate to 6
per cent. This helped move money out of short-term deposits (included in M3)
and into longer term funds.
Recently, Bundesbank directors have made clear they see no immediate case
for further interest rate reductions, especially with the strong economic
revival.
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, bank president, said this week the bank wanted to keep
money market rates stable in the face of international volatility. The next
Bundesbank council meeting is on Thursday. The bank said the introduction of
money market funds into Germany had had some impact on the slower M3 trend
but this should not be exaggerated.
About DM5bn (Pounds 2bn) flowed into foreign-based money market funds in
August and DM3bn in September; a further DM1.2bn went into German-registered
funds.
Not all of this came from assets in the M3 definition, however. Some came
from abroad and some was switched from bond holdings by investors nervous
about long-term interest rate trends.
'M3 would have grown somewhat more strongly without money market funds, but
the difference cannot be specified from information provided by the
Bundesbank,' said Mr Richard Reid, an economist with UBS, the Swiss bank.
He, too, thought M3 had not slowed enough to prompt a rate cut at the next
two fortnightly council meetings.
