FT  03 SEP 93 / Stein to retire from chair of Ladbroke


   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent


MR CYRIL Stein is to retire at the end of the year after 37 years at the
head of Ladbroke Group. He was chairman for 27 years. Mr Stein, 65, will be
a non-executive director for a further three years.
Mr John Jackson, a 64-year-old non-executive director, moves from
vice-chairman to chairman. Mr Peter George, 49, vice-chairman and joint
managing director, will become chief executive of the hotels, betting,
property and do-it-yourself group.
The group yesterday announced an unchanged 4.92p interim dividend for the
half-year to June 30, despite a fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 62.5m from
Pounds 84.4m.
Earnings per share declined to 3.98p from 4.73p. Net borrowings at the
half-year were Pounds 1.34bn, the same as in December, leaving gearing at 52
per cent.
Mr Jackson said the board would not be right to cut the dividend when it
appeared business prospects were improving.
'Things are looking a darn sight better than a year ago,' he said.
Turnover increased to Pounds 2.21bn from Pounds 1.99bn. Profit in the hotels
division slipped to Pounds 44.4m (Pounds 49.3m) on increased turnover of
Pounds 431.6m (Pounds 383.2m). Room occupancies were down in continental
Europe, the Americas, the Middle East and Japan. They were up slightly in
the rest of Asia.
Mr George said the UK was a bright spot for the hotels division, with London
in particular showing a healthy improvement.
Racing profits rose to Pounds 40.5m (Pounds 36m) on turnover of Pounds
1.33bn (Pounds 1.2bn). The group expected to benefit from further
deregulation of the betting industry. Property showed a profit of Pounds
800,000 after last year's loss of Pounds 14.8m.
At Texas Homecare, profits fell to Pounds 15.7m (Pounds 26.8m) on virtually
unchanged turnover of Pounds 365.4m. Mr George said margins had suffered on
large items such as kitchens, bathrooms and furniture.
He said Texas had made progress in cutting stocks and was relying more
heavily on delivering directly from suppliers to customers.
Ladbroke's share price rose 8p to 210p.
