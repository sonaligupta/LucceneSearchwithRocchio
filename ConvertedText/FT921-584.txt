FT  28 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Portmeirion


Portmeirion Potteries (Holdings) reported a 24 per cent fall in profits to
Pounds 2.61m pre-tax for 1991. Sales, however, were boosted by a favourable
exchange rate and rose by 5 per cent to Pounds 20.4m.
A proposed final dividend of 5.1p makes a same-again 7.35p total. Earnings
fell by 29 per cent to 16.68p per share.
Mr George Hesp, managing director, said the recession had affected demand,
particularly in the UK. He added that the notable exception to an otherwise
worldwide reduction in demand was the US where, despite the recession, sales
had increased by 23 per cent.
Mr Hesp anticipated that demand in 1982 would continue to be affected by the
unfavourable economic situation.
