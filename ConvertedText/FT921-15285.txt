FT  10 JAN 92 / Privatisation 'to go ahead' in Poland


   By ANTHONY ROBINSON, East Europe Editor


POLAND'S new minister of privatisation, Mr Tomasz Gruszecki, has taken the
unusual step of publicly declaring his support for Poland's complex and
widespread privatisation programme.
In a move apparently designed to dispel the impression that the centre-right
government led by Mr Jan Olszewski has a lower committment to privatisation
than its predecessors, the minister said considerable attention would be
given to its implementation.
The aim of the programme is to privatise some 200-400 medium to large state
enterprises. Their ownership will be transferred to national investment
funds (managed by international fund managers), whose shares will be
distributed to members of the public.
The previous government, which drew up the plan, was advised by a number of
City companies and banks, including S G Warburg, the merchant bankers, and
accountants Touche Ross.
Before Christmas, Mr Olszewski, the prime minister, had criticised the
former government's economic policies, saying he rejected 'the theory of
building a healthy economy only on the ruins of state enterprises'.
