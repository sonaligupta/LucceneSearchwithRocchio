FT  30 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome worry


   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY


Wellcome remained under the hammer in a generally unhappy health and
household sector, with the market said to have been unsettled by a very
low-priced 'print' or trade in the ADR's, recorded on the Seaq ticker during
the session, indicating that the shares had come under heavy selling
pressure in the US.
Wellcome shares have attracted sustained selling pressure over the past few
weeks as the market has worried about the challenge being mounted to
Wellcome's patent in the US on its AZT anti-Aids drug. The court case, being
held in North Carolina, commenced on Monday.
At their worst yesterday Wellcome traded as low as 660p, before stabilising
and moving up to end a busy day at 673p, for a net loss of 15, the lowest
closing level since July 1991. Turnover was never more than thin and
eventually reached 1.1m shares.
Wall Street's early weakness triggered selling of all the leading
pharmaceuticals stocks in London. Glaxo, hit recently by numerous broker
downgrades, lost 7 more to 563p on 2.7m traded. SmithKline Beecham moved
against the overall trend, however, settling a net 2 higher at 437p on 1.2m,
following support from one of the leading UK broking houses.
ICI, under constant pressure recently following some hefty profits
downgrades by top broking firms, rallied to close 5 1/2 up at 658p on 2m
traded. Ever-present takeover speculation drove Fisons up 2 more to 179p,
after 180p.
French theme park operator Euro Disney fell 12 to 798p after French press
reports that attendances have fallen dramatically in the last quarter.
Favourable comment on Monday's results and acquisition helped Airtours gain
4 to 338p. Rival tour operator Owners Abroad climbed 4 to 102p and Eurocamp
also added 4 to 231p.
Profit-taking restricted Thorn EMI, off 5 at 910p, and Rank Organisation, 16
down at 780p.
The Irish banks responded to currency moves with Allied Irish up 6 at 263p
and Bank of Ireland the same amount firmer at 253p.
Caledonia Investment jumped 25 t0 484p after announcing a 38 per cent
increase in preliminary profits.
Prudential Group held up well in an otherwise weak life assurance sector,
the shares steadying around the 340 1/2 p-mark after a strong buy
recommendation issued by Hoare Govett. The broker's insurance team said
Prudential shares offered 'significant upside' and that Prudential's
dividend growth will at least equal that of the UK market and more likely
outperform.
Royal Insurance continued to outpace the rest of the composites, moving up 6
more to 310p on good turnover of 3.9m. Insurance brokers attracted renewed
strong support with Lowndes Lambert 5 up at 384p after excellent results,
showing profits up 11 per cent at Pounds 10.3m. JIB put on 7 to 217p.
Seeboard hit the front in the regional electricity sector's 'dividend race',
upping the dividend by 16 per cent, and easily outpacing the early runners
in the sector's 'payout stakes'. 'The race is still on,' said one utilities
analyst. Electricity shares have risen sharply this week, responding to
strong buy recommendations issued by leading brokers such as Kleinwort
Benson and Smith New Court.
Seeboard ended a busy session a net 10 higher at 520p, followed by the likes
of Midland, up 9 1/2 at 481 1/2 p ahead of figures due on July 6, and
Southern, up 8 1/2 at 471 1/2 p ahead of preliminaries due on July 1.
Among the recs that have already declared their results, Yorkshire put on 10
to 512p, and Norweb 6 to 495p.
The latest spurt by the 'recs' triggered a fresh burst of support for
Northern Ireland Electricity which advanced 5 to 130p on good turnover of
4.9m; Prudential Corporation announced it has acquired 5.19m shares, or a
3.15 per cent stake, in the company since its flotation last week.
Securicor and its associate Security Services made rapid progress after
revealing profits up 27 per cent and 36 per cent respectively. Securicor 'A'
jumped 11 to 645p and Security Services 14 to 549p.
Ferranti dropped 3 to 11 3/4 p after the continuing losses with the shares
additionally weakened by the sale of a block of 2m shares as part of a
mid-morning programme trade.
Banana dealer Geest climbed on news that Germany had lost its case in the
European Court of Justice against the introduction of the new EC import
system for bananas.
A slightly downbeat trading statement from Sears left the stores group a
half-penny adrift at 99p.
The appointment of a new chief executive at Storehouse ended a 4-month
period of uncertainty and the shares advanced 3 to 212p.
A confident forecast and reasonable results by John Waddington pleased the
market, sending the shares up 11 to 230p in moderate turnover.
Shares of newly-named publisher Headline Hodder closed marginally better at
355p in its new ex-rights form as it made its debut in the market.
