FT  22 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Quarterlies and bond weakness
hit Dow

Wall Street
DISAPPOINTING corporate earnings and a stalled bond market rally trimmed
early gains on US markets yesterday to leave share prices virtually
unchanged at the close, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended up 1.08 at 3,187.10, well below its
early highs when the index approached 3,200. The more broadly based Standard
& Poor's 500 also closed slightly firmer, up 0.19 at 415.67, while the Amex
composite rose 2.02 to 373.42 and the Nasdaq maintained its recently strong
performance with a gain of 4.45 at 597.15. Turnover on the NYSE was 217m
shares, and declines outpaced rises by 907 to 828.
Prices opened firmer, buoyed by hopes in Europe that the Bundesbank will cut
German interest rates soon, allowing other countries to reduce domestic
rates. The market was also boosted by an early rise in bond prices, which
have been hard hit lately by concern that if Mr Bill Clinton wins the
presidential election he would adopt an expansionary fiscal policy that
could reignite inflation and widen the deficit.
Bond prices, however, were unable to hold on to their gains, a weakness
which was quickly transferred to equities. Although bonds later recovered,
stocks remained troubled by some disappointing third quarter earnings
reports from major US companies.
Among the worst performing individual stocks, United Technologies fell
Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 45 1/2 in turnover of 1.7m shares after the company
reported a quarterly profit of 95 cents a share, up from 90 cents a share a
year ago but below analysts' forecasts.
Another disappointment was Conner Peripherals, which fell Dollars 2 1/4 to
Dollars 18 3/4 in turnover of 2.7m shares in spite of reporting a big rise
in profits to Dollars 41.9m. The earnings failed to meet market
expectations.
Schlumberger dropped Dollars 2 to Dollars 68 after the oil and electronics
group announced third quarter net income of Dollars 172.7m, down from
Dollars 196.2m a year earlier, and said that it remained cautious about near
term earnings because of worldwide economic conditions and low business
confidence.
Chrysler rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 26 1/4 in turnover of 2m shares in the
wake of good earnings figures earlier in the week. The stock also received a
boost from broking house Warburg Securities, which raised its earnings
estimates for the car group. Ford and General Motors, which have yet to
report their earnings, rose Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 38 5/8 and Dollars 1 to
Dollars 30 7/8 respectively.
On the Nasdaq market, MCI Communications firmed Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 35
7/8 after reporting third quarter profits of Dollars 154m, up from Dollars
133m at the same stage last year.

TORONTO share prices ended higher for the fifth consecutive session. The TSE
300 composite index climbed 10.79 points, or 0.33 per cent, to 3,252.63.
Advancing issues led declines 288 to 234. Volume was 25.7m shares worth
CDollars 252.1m compared with the previous 30.7m shares worth CDollars
283.2m.
The transportation sector jumped 3.02 per cent on index, boosted by Laidlaw
B shares, and the industrial products sector gained 1 per cent on index.
