Mr John Schaap, the former chief executive of Australian Airlines, the large
domestic airline which was acquired by Qantas in 1992, is to leave the
merged carrier today, writes Nikki Tait.
Mr Schaap, who for the past 18 months has been general manager of Qantas'
Australian operations, said he had 'explored a number of options available
to him as part of the new Qantas management structure but none was found to
be suitable'.
