FT  02 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Picture of Belarus prospects not so
bleak


   From Ms ROBERTA FELDMAN


Sir, Matthew Kaminski's and Anthony Robinson's article, 'Belarus finds
breaking up is hard to do' (October 12), may paint too bleak a picture of
reform there. In fact, many economic officials at both the local and
national levels are anxious to implement reforms and ready to listen to
advice.
For example, the International Finance Corporation's small-scale
privatisation assistance project in the city of Brest, begun in June,
resulted in Belarus's first open auction on September 29, ahead of schedule.
Cities and regions all over Belarus are now requesting privatisation
assistance from IFC, and the government of Belarus has requested advice on
rationalising privatisation legislation, including the voucher law.
Reformers in Minsk and the provinces often want and welcome assistance.
Unfortunately, western experts have so far largely overlooked Belarus in
favour of its neighbours.
