A dismissed worker stormed into a Japanese-owned fibre optics plant
yesterday and shot dead two people and wounded two others, AP reports from
Research Triangle Park, North Carolina.
The gunman later killed himself.
An employee at Sumitomo Electric Fibre Optics said: 'He apparently came in
and shot the ones who fired him.'
The man's former supervisor and a woman who had filed a sexual harassment
complaint against him were reported to have been shot.
