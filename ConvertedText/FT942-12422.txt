FT  29 APR 94 / International Company News: Fitzwilton lifts Wellworth stake


   By TIM COONE


   DUBLIN


Fitzwilton, the Irish holding company chaired by Mr Tony O'Reilly, chief
executive of Heinz, surprised the market with the announcement of a 1-for-1
open offer worth IPounds 47.3m (Pounds 45.9m) to lift its stake in the
Northern Ireland-based Wellworth food retailing group from 42.7 per cent to
97 per cent.
At the same time Fitzwilton announced a pre-tax loss of IPounds 13.8m
(IPounds 27.9m restated) for the year to December 31 1993, after an IPounds
18.3m provision for goodwill write-off on the proposed disposal of its M6
cash and carry division in the UK.
Operating profits more than doubled from IPounds 4.3m to IPounds 10.5m,
largely on the back of the turnround at Waterford Wedgwood, in which
Fitzwilton has a 9.4 per cent stake.
The open offer, at 43p per share, is underwritten by Morgan Grenfell and
together with various options being exercised by Mr O'Reilly lifts the total
shares in the group from 117m to 252m.
Fitzwilton's original 42.7 per cent stake was bought for Pounds 18.3m. The
additional 54.3 per cent will cost Pounds 41.6m on completion, and Pounds
75m in senior and mezzanine debt used in the original purchase in October
1992 by Erne, the buy-out vehicle, will be taken into the Fitzwilton balance
sheet giving a post-acquisition gearing of about 93 per cent.
According to Fitzwilton, Wellworth had audited net assets of Pounds 63.9m at
December 31. It showed operating profits of Pounds 18.2m on turnover of
Pounds 252.6m. This compared with Pounds 18.6m in pre-tax profits on
turnover of Pounds 236m for the year to April 25 1992, prior to its buy-out
from Isosceles.
Fitzwilton's stake in its Rennicks subsidiary, a road sign manufacturer, is
also to be increased from 51 to 76 per cent, costing IPounds 2.9m.
Losses per share came to 14.77p, while headline earnings per share amounted
to 1.63p compared with losses of 2.77p in 1992. An unchanged final dividend
of 2p is proposed for a 3.5p total.
COMMENT
Fitzwilton has a history of acquisitions and disposals over the years which
have done little to enhance shareholder value. Its cash and carry and motor
vehicle finance divisions have each stayed about five years in the group,
and have resulted in a total goodwill write-off of some IPounds 43m on
disposal. One can only hope that its new focus on the highly competitive
business of food retailing will not end up similarly blurred five years down
the road. A 1994 earnings figure of about 3.5p looks probable giving a
prospective p/e in excess of 15, and making even the discounted open offer
price of 43p look close to being fully valued.
