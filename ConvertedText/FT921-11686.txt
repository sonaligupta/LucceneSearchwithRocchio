FT  30 JAN 92 / Top Peru official alleges drug links


   By SALLY BOWEN


   LIMA


MR Hernando de Soto, top adviser and personal representative of President
Alberto Fujimori of Peru, resigned this week amid accusations of government
involvement in drugs-related corruption, reports Sally Bowen in Lima.
Mr de Soto had been Mr Fujimori's principal, if informal, link for some 20
months in negotiations with the US, initially over re-establishment of
Peru's international financial relations and later on the bilateral
anti-narcotics agreement signed last May.
More recently he had been developing contacts with Europe-based
multinational corporations to secure assistance for an ambitious programme
to cultivate other sub-tropical crops in place of coca, which yields
cocaine.
Mr de Soto alleged, in a hard-hitting resignation letter, that officials in
Peru's coca-growing zones are co-operating with drug traffickers. This
allegation, made at such a high level, will severely embarrass the president
and further jeopardise US aid related to combatting drugs.
Elsewhere in his letter, Mr de Soto said Latin American stabilisation
programmes in general, and Peru's in particular, had benefited only those
close to power.
