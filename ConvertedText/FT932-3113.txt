FT  16 JUN 93 / FDA warns Pepsi drinkers about cans

   NEW YORK


THE US Food and Drug Administration has warned US consumers that they should
take precautions before drinking canned Diet Pepsi, after syringes were
found in a number of cans in Washington state and Louisiana.
The product-tampering surfaced in the Seattle area, where two incidents were
reported last week. Three cans containing syringes were subsequently
reported in New Orleans. A further case, involving a can of Diet Coke,
emerged in California yesterday but a hoax was suspected.
Mr David Kessler, commissioner of the FDA which is investigating the
incidents, advised consumers to empty Pepsi into a glass or cup before
drinking. PepsiCo said it had no plans to recall products and that there
appeared to be no connection between the Seattle and New Orleans cases.
PepsiCo shares fell Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 35 5/8 on Wall Street yesterday.
