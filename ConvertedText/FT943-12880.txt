FT  22 JUL 94 / Property: One for the gamblers - Office investment is a
triumph of hope over experience


   By MATTHEW OAKESHOTT


Institutions began measuring the performance of their property portfolios
about 25 years ago. Their office investments have since enjoyed only two
short spurts in which they have out-performed shops and industrial property,
in the early 1970s and the late 1980s. These were the two wildest
speculative booms this century. Both ended in decline in the general
property market and disaster for office investments. Otherwise offices have
persistently underperformed retail and industrial property in both capital
and rental values.
There are two main reasons why the rotten record of offices is taking so
long to be recognised - large lot sizes (which institutions understand) and
depreciation (which most do not). UK institutions have swung from inertia to
hyperactivity over the past decade in their allocation of assets between
property and other areas of investment.
In the early 1980s, most self-managed funds gave no sign of having any
policy on what the property proportion of total assets should be. Now
institutions have moved to the other extreme. Many seem to look no more than
a year ahead; there is thus pressure to pour large sums into property in a
hurry when it 'looks right', as has happened over the past year. Fund
managers under pressure chase lumpy investments, usually big office blocks.
Once the bloom comes off the property rose (a process which started recently
in the UK when the cold winds blew from the bond markets) and the asset
managers want to cut back on property, the selling pressure then becomes
greatest on the same big office blocks which have been used to force money
into the market on the way up.
Offices have a worse long-term record than the market as a whole, and are
more volatile than the other sectors. They provide spectacular profits for
the few developers and dealers who get their timing right. Meanwhile the
institutions predictably got their timing wrong in the last upturn, with
their two heaviest years' spending on office development occurring just as
the bubble burst in 1988 and 1990.
Investors always underestimate the costs of office depreciation and changing
occupational requirements. These are much higher than for shops, and
slightly higher than for industrial/warehouse property.
Investors therefore need at least as thick a cushion of running yield on
offices as on industrials to compensate for the much higher long-term
holding costs compared with a typical high street shop, where the value is
mostly in the land.
Well located shops do not depreciate, but offices and industrial properties
always have done, since the building element represents a big part of the
total value. No matter how well designed, buildings do wear out and the way
people work in offices changes even faster. This hits the office investor,
as an example of a new office building let on a 25-year lease shows.
The investor buys his shiny new office at a prime (low) yield - say, 8 per
cent or 7 per cent now. For the first few years, the rental value grows in
line with rents in other new offices; perhaps even at the second rent review
(after 10 years) growth is still maintaining that pattern. But by the third
rent review (after 15 years), obsolescence of both kinds is beginning to
take its toll, with the rent rise lagging new office rents by, say, 1 per
cent a year, with a further 1 per cent a year lag by year 20, and another 2
per cent a year in the run-up to the end of the lease after 25 years.
Then the investor has a building with no guarantee of future income, where
the tenant may be prepared to stay but will be in a strong position to
demand either refurbishment from the investor, or a rent below new
state-of-the-art offices, or both. The investor will have suffered slowing
income growth, and possible extra capital expenditure and a capital loss on
the final valuation as well, since the yield on which the 25-year-old
property is valued will have moved up sharply - say, to 9-10 per cent if
prime yields on new offices are still 6-7 per cent.
Offices are overpriced, and institutions are over-invested in them on any
assessment of their long-term record. Though institutions have been net
sellers of office investments according to Investment Property Databank, a
research group, over the past nine years, and the office proportion has
fallen from two-thirds in the early 1970s to two-fifths today, offices are
still the largest sector in most portfolios.
This weighting reflects a triumph of hope over experience. In the early
1970s, yields on office and shop investments were similar. Industrial yields
were 2-3 per cent higher to allow for depreciation and obsolescence. In the
past few years, office yields have moved above shop yields, with the gap
about 1 1/2 per cent at present. As the evidence of poor office rental
growth and ever-increasing depreciation costs piles up, office yields should
move above industrial/warehouse yields and stay there for the foreseeable
future.
In any other market, an investment sector with as poor and risky a record as
offices would stand on the lowest rating and highest yield. In property,
tradition and inertia can spread fundamental changes like this out over many
years. But investors' downgrading of offices is under way and may
accelerate, as their approach to property investment grows more like their
techniques in equity and bonds.
Today, institutions can collectively reduce their office weightings very
fast so long as overseas buyers, with their fixation on large London
offices, don't wake up in time. You may even find a bigger fool to buy your
office in a few years if you buy or develop it today - but all the evidence
of the past 25 years points clearly to retail and industrial property
consistently performing better than offices. Offices are for gamblers,
developers and middlemen, not serious long-term investors.
