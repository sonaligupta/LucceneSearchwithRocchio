FT  19 APR 91 / The Guinness Appeals: Role of trial judge defended


   By RAYMOND HUGHES


THE Guinness trial judge did not usurp the jury's task of deciding whether
Mr Ernest Saunders, the former chairman and chief executive of Guinness, and
his co-accused had acted dishonestly, the Court of Appeal was told
yesterday.
In his summing-up, Mr Justice Henry from first to last had told the jury to
look for dishonesty, said Mr John Chadwick QC, for the prosecution.
Mr Chadwick was countering defence complaints that the judge had withdrawn
from the jury charges brought under section 151 of the 1985 Companies Act
after giving the impression that offences under that section, involving
dishonesty, must have been committed.
In relation to all the charges, which included conspiracy, theft and false
accounting, the judge had emphasised that the jury had to be satisfied of
the dishonesty of each defendant in relation to each charge, Mr Chadwick
said.
Mr Saunders, Mr Anthony Parnes, a City stockbroker, and Mr Gerald Ronson,
head of the Heron group, are appealing against their convictions and
sentences.
Mr Saunders is serving five years and Mr Parnes 2 1/2 years. Mr Ronson,
released in February after serving just under half his 12-month sentence,
was also fined Pounds 5m.
Mr Chadwick contended that when Mr Justice Henry told the jury that a
Guinness share-support operation during its takeover battle for Distillers
had been unlawful, he had not prejudged the issue of whether the defendants'
involvement in it had been dishonest.
The judge had plainly said that, even though indemnities and success fees
fell foul of section 151, which prohibits a company giving financial
assistance for the purchase of its own shares, the jury had to be satisfied
there had been dishonesty, Mr Chadwick said.
The appeals continue on Monday.
