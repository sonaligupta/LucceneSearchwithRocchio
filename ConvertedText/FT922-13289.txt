FT  13 APR 92 / Letter: Not such a difficult registering process


   From Miss M V HILL


Sir, I would not like your readers to retain the impression that Ms Reed's
experience of registering with the Securities and Futures Authority was
necessarily typical (Management: 'Financial stamp of disapproval', April 7).
I am also a one-person business. Recently, after being made redundant, I
registered with the SFA as an investment adviser, but also not to handle
client money, nor to deal with the general public.
It was clear from the application forms that the fee was non-refundable:
this is part of the cost of starting up in business. Lawyers' and
accountants' fees were also incurred, but were kept to a minimum by having
them review my own work. It was, after all, my future business plan.
It was also clear from the documentation that my accountants would also need
to be approved, but they registered in parallel with my application. I did
not find the process onerous, but did follow the SFA's advice of submitting
all the details at the same time.
In my experience, the SFA provided constructive and timely assistance
throughout. I was elected to membership just four months from receiving the
first information package.
Miss M V Hill,
