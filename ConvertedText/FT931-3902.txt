FT  13 MAR 93 / Wholesale prices rise by 0.4%


   By JUREK MARTIN


WHOLESALE prices in the US rose by 0.4 per cent in February compared with
January, the largest monthly increase in more than two years but not
necessarily a harbinger of new inflationary pressures.
Behind the increase in the producer price index - double the 0.2 per cent
advance of January - were more expensive home heating oil, petrol, tobacco
and new cars. Overall, the energy component of the index went up by 1.7 per
cent.
Food prices, on the other hand, were generally slightly lower, with bigger
falls recorded for a wide range of fruit and vegetables. Prices for finished
goods other than food and energy, both subject to greater volatility, rose
by 0.3 per cent in the month, under the 0.4 per cent increase of January.
Consumer prices in January rose by 0.5 per cent. The February report is due
out next Wednesday and will be keenly watched for any evidence of an
inflationary trend taking hold as the economy continues its recovery.
However, the consensus economic view, reinforced by the congressional
testimony of the 12 regional presidents of the Federal Reserve system on
Wednesday, remains one of relative price stability this year, though with
some increases in view next year.
Meanwhile the Senate budget committee on Thursday night approved a
resolution with more ambitious deficit reduction targets than proposed by
President Bill Clinton.
More significant than the numbers, at this stage only notional guidelines
since no actual programme cuts have been considered by Congress, is the fact
that Democrats on the committee held the line in turning down no fewer than
34 Republican amendments.
