FT  27 OCT 92 / World Trade News: New entrants boost UK exports - British
Aerospace remains leading exporter


   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor


SEVEN OUT of the top 10 British exporters saw a fall in the overall value of
their exports between 1990 and 1991, the FT's latest survey of top exporters
shows.
It was left to new entrants - such as Nissan and Vauxhall, which
significantly boosted their exports from the UK in 1991 - and a tiny
miscellany of outstanding performers to keep exports growing - albeit by
less than 1 per cent to Pounds 45.2bn.
British Aerospace remained the UK's leading exporter, but saw exports fall
by 5.5 per cent to Pounds 4.6bn.
ICI also held its place at number two - also recording a 2.56 per cent fall
in overseas sales.
The only improvements inside the Top 10 came from Ford, whose exports edged
up by 1.9 per cent to Pounds 2.78bn, and Guinness, which edged up one place
to 10th position as the result of a 4 per cent export improvement to Pounds
849m.
Shell 'rose' from seventh to fifth place on the back of a revision of its
1990 performance: its exports actually fell by more than 5 per cent to
Pounds 2.4bn.
A total of 37 companies in the Top 100 are foreign owned, with 21 of these
belonging to US parents. Of the UK companies in the Top 100, exports fell by
1.5 per cent, from Pounds 30.9bn in 1990 to Pounds 30.4bn last year. By
contrast, the foreign-owned companies saw exports rise by 6.4 per cent to
Pounds 14.9bn.
Of passing comfort to leading British exporters was the fact that export
performance held up in spite of falls in turnover and employment in the UK.
Overall turnover for the Top 100 fell by 3.1 per cent to Pounds 140bn, while
they trimmed 6.6 per cent of their workforce - involving the loss of 110,000
jobs. At the same time, their turnover outside the UK rose by 3.2 per cent
to Pounds 167bn.
Among the handful of buoyant performances, the Weir Group leapt from 99th to
81st place on the back of a 26 per cent improvement in exports and a 34 per
cent surge in turnover.
Boots and Marks and Spencer also boosted overseas sales by around a quarter
to leap up the rankings - putting Boots in the top 100 for the first time,
and lifting Marks and Spencer to 54th position. Both boosted exports on
virtually stagnant turnover - Boots up 2.9 per cent and Marks and Spencer up
0.4 per cent.
Westland also reported a 26 per cent improvement in an otherwise drab
aero-engineering sector which saw overall exports fall by 5.5 per cent.
This fall was due in part to lower exports from British Aerospace, but in
addition resulted from a 9 per cent decline in exports by Rolls-Royce. The
aero-engine maker slipped from 6th to 7th position as foreign sales fell to
Pounds 2.06bn.
Three oil companies - all US owned - performed well, with Esso boosting
exports by almost 42 per cent to climb to 11th position in the Top 100.
Texaco boosted exports by 25 per cent, with Mobil up 21 per cent.
In spite of improved export performances, all three reported falls in
turnover: Esso and Mobil of 3 per cent apiece, and Texaco of 13 per cent.
Other good performers were British Nuclear Fuels, up 50 per cent, with BAT
Industries up 30 per cent, Thorn EMI up 23 per cent, and Hanson Trust up 27
per cent.
Dobson Park Industries crept in as the 100th largest exporter after a 35 per
cent improvement in exports to Pounds 72m. While Dobson Park's UK turnover
fell by 13.5 per cent to Pounds 152m, offshore output rose by 19 per cent to
Pounds 154m.
The most extraordinary headway was made by Nissan, whose exports leapt by
108 per cent, from Pounds 328m in 1990 to Pounds 682m last year, and
Vauxhall, whose 247 per cent jump took its exports to Pounds 620m.
Also impressive was Sheerness Steel, which crept into the Top 100 for the
first time - to 97th place - because of a 146 per cent improvement in
foreign sales to Pounds 84m.
Export growth came at Sheerness despite a 26 per cent fall in UK turnover -
a factor vividly shown by the fact that in 1990, exports accounted for just
26 per cent of turnover, compared with 86 per cent last year.
In terms of its export dependency in 1991, Sheerness was third only to
Nissan - which exported 87.5 per cent of its turnover - and Caterpillar,
which exported 89 per cent. Associated Octel, at 85 per cent came close
behind.
Other companies with an extremely high level of export dependency included
IBM (57 per cent of UK turnover); Wellcome (72 per cent); Rothmans (60 per
cent); Allied Colloids (78 per cent) and Amersham International (76 per
cent).
Takeovers took Hawker Siddeley, Dowty and Davy out of the Top 100, while
Philips, Rank Xerox and ASW failed to provide necessary data.
