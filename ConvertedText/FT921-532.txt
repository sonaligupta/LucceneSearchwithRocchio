FT  28 MAR 92 / Finance & The Family: Stop loss policies hitch


   By RICHARD LAPPER


NAMES AT Lloyd's of London, the insurance market, have been experiencing
difficulties in obtaining stop loss insurance policies, which provide them
with reinsurance.
Valentine Powell, chief executive of the Association of Lloyd's Names, which
represents more than 9,000 Names, says his organisation has been receiving
inquiries from worried Names who - with nearly a quarter of the underwriting
year already gone - have been unable to obtain cover.
Underwriters have been shying away from the policies - because of heavy
losses. Nevertheless some cover is or should become available.
Four schemes are being marketed.
Brokers Holman Wade and Steel Burrill Jones still assembling underwriting
support for the market's most comprehensive scheme and hope to be able to
offer quotes to Names within the next few weeks.
Last year the scheme provided three year policies for about 8,000 Names
offering cover of Pounds 500,000 in excess of an amount equivalent on
average to 18 per cent of a Name's premium income limit.
This year brokers expect to be able to offer the facilities but on a one
year basis with cover reduced to Pounds 250,000 excess of 15 per cent. Rates
are expected to rise by about 50 per cent. A Name underwriting Pounds
500,000 would pay up to Pounds 8,000 against about Pounds 5,500 last year.
Brokers Robert Frazer and Fenchurch also offer a one-year facility with less
cover - Pounds 100,000 - but over a lower excess - of 10 per cent. Rates are
roughly up 25 per cent on last year and capacity is still available.
Stop Loss Mutual, a venture founded by Charles Taylor & Co, says it has sold
3,000 policies of a kind which provide Names with more limited cover.
The facility, which was made available for the first time last year, does
not provide Names with a contract of indemnity but mutualises the excessive
losses of all Names backing the scheme.
Premiums paid by Names are invested in a fund out of which all claims are
paid. Once the fund is exhausted all claims are scaled down - with all Names
claiming on the fund receiving only a proportion of their claims.
Charles Taylor offers two policies. Class 1 is provided on the basis of a
four year commitment, and entails payment of Pounds 875 a year for cover up
to Pounds 25,000 per year, once losses exceed Pounds 300,000.
Class 2 policies offer cover up to Pounds 100,000 in excess of an amount
equivalent to between 7 1/2 per cent and 20 per cent of allocated premium
income.
The premium for class 2 involves an advance premium of Pounds 1,615 a year
but if losses in any year demand it, a supplementary premium, not exceeding
Pounds 1,615 is levied.
Seascope, the brokers, have been offering quotes for two facilities since
last December but now have very little capacity available.
One policy offers cover of Pounds 100,000 in excess of a minimum of 12 1/2
per cent, for a premium of Pounds 5,000. Cover can be increased to Pounds
150,000 for an extra Pounds 1,000 in premium.
