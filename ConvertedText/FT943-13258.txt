FT  20 JUL 94 / International Company News: Sales slip in Europe behind fall
at Unisys


   By LOUISE KEHOE


Unisys, the US computer company, reported a decline in revenues and earnings
for the second quarter as European sales of mainframe computers slowed.
Net income was Dollars 49.9m, or 12 cents a fully diluted share, down
sharply from Dollars 103m, or 39 cents, in the same period last year.
Revenues fell to Dollars 1.8bn from Dollars 1.93bn.
'Our results in the quarter did not meet our expectations,' said Mr James
Unruh, chairman and chief executive. The company had warned that earnings
would drop, based on slower than anticipated sales in Europe and declining
US government systems sales.
'Our US government business declined while our worldwide commercial revenue
was flat, year-to-year,' said Mr Unruh. However, US commercial business and
sales in the Asia Pacific region grew, he added.
European revenue, although continuing to decline, is doing so at a slower
rate than over the past six months, the company said. Unisys said it would
not plan on growth in European revenue until the fourth quarter, at the
earliest.
'Despite these current business conditions, the transformation of Unisys is
on track,' Mr Unruh said.
Unisys returned to profitability in 1992 after three years of heavy losses.
Revenues, however, have continued to decline.
For the half year, Unisys reported net income of Dollars 109.9m, or 28 cents
a fully diluted share, against net income of Dollars 363.6m, or Dollars
1.48. The 1994 half-year included a charge of Dollars 7.7m for costs
associated with repurchase of debt.
The 1993 figure included a net gain from accounting changes of Dollars
203.8m, or 83 cents.
