FT  22 OCT 92 / Mideast peace talks resume


   By GEORGE GRAHAM


   WASHINGTON


TALKS between Israeli, Syrian and Palestinian negotiators resumed in
Washington yesterday, amid rising concern that time might be running out for
the year-old Middle East peace process.
Israel presented a new paper in its talks with Syria, re-formulating what
its negotiators called the 'eternal trinity of peace, security and
territory'.
It was unclear, however, whether the new Israel proposal would meet the
Syrian demand for 'total withdrawal' from occupied Arab lands, including the
Golan Heights taken from Syria in 1967.
Israeli officials would not go into the details of their proposals but
indicated they understood that a full peace settlement, including mutual
recognition and provisions for maintaining secure borders, would have to
include a territorial element.
The seventh round of talks has been clouded by doubts over the re-election
of US President George Bush, whose chief of staff, Mr James Baker, launched
the Middle East peace process. Some Arab delegates, in particular, have
speculated whether Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential
candidate, would be as committed to the process.
Also, Palestinian negotiators have warned that their credibility as
spokesmen for their people is running out. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime
minister, is similarly under pressure to produce results.
The US election being less than two weeks away, however, few observers
expect an immediate breakthrough in either the Israeli-Syrian or the
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.
