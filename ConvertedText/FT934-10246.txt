FT  06 NOV 93 / Rabbit out of business by end of December


   By RACHEL JOHNSON


YESTERDAY morning the 9,000 customers of Hutchison Whampoa's Rabbit
Telepoint service received letters telling them that from December 31 the
system would no longer exist, Rachel Johnson writes.
Subscribers will no longer be able to make calls with their Pounds 99 Rabbit
handsets.
Mr Mike Bowerman, the group director for paging and telepoint, was confident
there would be no exodus of subscribers even though its telepoint service -
together with its Mobile Data operation - had fallen victim to the
competition among UK telecommunications companies.
The company is offering a choice of deals, including cash refunds, in return
for Rabbit hardware, including:
A Nokia 101 or equivalent cellular telephone, including connection and
subscription to either Vodafone or Cellnet's standard cellular service, at
Pounds 7 per month for 12 months. Hutchison says this deal is worth up to
Pounds 500.
A free Hutchison message pager, with answering service, worth Pounds 100, at
Pounds 7 per month for 12 months, a package it says is worth Pounds 380.
A voucher for a Hutchison PCN (personal communications network) phone and 12
months subscription in return for a Rabbit handset, a package worth Pounds
500.
It was too early for some of Rabbit's biggest retail stockists - Comet and
Dixons - to digest the news of the withdrawal.
