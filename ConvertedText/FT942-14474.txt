FT  20 APR 94 / British Coal offers Pounds 6,000 per miner for shift changes


   By MICHAEL SMITH


British Coal is offering miners lump sums of Pounds 6,000 for radical
changes in working practices which will for the first time oblige them to
work weekends and extend the maximum rostered shift from 7 1/2 to 12 hours.
The offer - one of the most generous of its type in British industry - is
being opposed by unions, including the Union of Democratic Mineworkers which
says it provides inadequate compensation for the loss of opportunities for
miners to apply for generous redundancy payments.
Separately, miners at Tower colliery in south Wales yesterday abandoned
their fight to save the mine only four days after winning a reprieve. The
decision resulted from fears they could miss a British Coal redundancy
scheme which ends on April 30.
British Coal has told union leaders nationally that from next month the
maximum redundancy payment will be Pounds 27,000, against the existing
Pounds 44,000.
But even that will depend on their accepting the package including the
working hours deal. Failure to accept the deal would lead to 'state
redundancies only', with a maximum payment of less than Pounds 7,000.
Mr Mick Stevens, UDM general secretary for Nottinghamshire, yesterday
accused British Coal of blackmail. The offer was also condemned by Mr Arthur
Scargill, president of the National Union of Mineworkers.
British Coal says basic annual working hours including holidays will remain
the same, but miners may be required to work at weekends, for which they
will be paid time-and-a-half.
The UDM is balloting members.
