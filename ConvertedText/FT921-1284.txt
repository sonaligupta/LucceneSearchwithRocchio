FT  25 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Marketing costs check growth at Geest


   By ROLAND RUDD


GEEST, the fresh produce and prepared foods group, reported a 6 per cent
rise in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 24.8m to Pounds 26.2m, for the year to
December 28.
Mr David Sugden, chief executive, said the growth was less spectacular than
in previous years because of an additional Pounds 2m spending on new offices
in Miami and Brussels.
Profits were struck after an exceptional Pounds 166,000 (Pounds 90,000),
relating to the withdrawal from a wholesale business based in Brighton.
Turnover grew from Pounds 594.6m to Pounds 626.3m.
Trading profit from the fresh fruit business rose to Pounds 19.3m (Pounds
18.9m) on turnover of Pounds 508m (Pounds 478m).
The Central American operation, based in Miami and Costa Rica, is expected
to increase production by 60 per cent by the end of 1993.
Capital expenditure is set to rise from Pounds 17m to Pounds 40m by the end
of this year. About Pounds 25m is being invested in Costa Rica, plus Pounds
6m in a fresh pasta factory and Pounds 5m in a fresh bread factory, both
near Hull.
Trading profit from the food preparation businesses increased to Pounds 5.4m
(Pounds 3.9m).
The group has decided to withdraw from Macfish, the frozen fish business in
which it has a 50 per cent stake.
Mr Sugden said the move was 'timely' since it enabled the group to take the
Pounds 5.2m provisions below the line. A further Pounds 300,000 related to
an abortive acquisition. New financial reporting standards, which come into
effect later this year, stipulate that extraordinary items should be taken
above the line.
Associated Fisheries, which controls the other half of Macfish, said it
would also probably withdraw, incurring a Pounds 5.5m extraordinary charge.
Earnings rose to 26.3p (23.2p). A final dividend of 4.3p makes a total of
7.9p (7p).
COMMENT
By Geest's standards these were disappointing results. In spite of difficult
trading conditions the market has grown used to profit growth in double
figures. Most analysts downgraded their forecasts for 1992 from Pounds 30m
to Pounds 28m, giving earnings per share of 27.7p. This would put the
shares, down 4p at 340p, on a prospective multiple of 12.2. Yet investors
looking at the long-term should be pleased at the manner in which the
company has positioned itself to take advantage of changes that are likely
to come in the banana market in Europe. The present anomaly allowing most
European countries to restrict access to their markets to benefit their
former colonies is likely to end. Geest's Costa Rica production could
significantly increase 1993 earnings, suggesting that the shares may be
undervalued.
