FT  12 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow falters on interest rate
concern

Wall Street
US EQUITIES faltered as Wall Street registered concern about the direction
of interest rates, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average retreated 22.36 to 3,208.63 in
unexceptional NYSE volume of 186m shares. Big board declines led advances by
more than two-to-one.
This negative sentiment was mirrored in the broadly based Standard & Poor's
500, which receded 2.86 to 404.03, and there were similar declines in the
secondary market, where the Nasdaq composite fell 6.32 to 617.14. On Tuesday
the Dow rose about 16 points.
Both the stock market and the long end of the bond market were depressed
after President George Bush said he was 'more concerned about stimulating
the economy than pushing rates down'. While economic recovery is generally
positive for the market, Wall Street's recent strength has come from the
additional liquidity created by falling interest rates.
Weakness yesterday in overseas markets also contributed to the selling on
Wall Street.
The most active issue was Valassis Communications, which was quoted at
Dollars 16 3/4 . The initial offering of 22.1m shares was priced at Dollars
17 a share through underwriters led by Salomon Brothers, significantly below
the Dollars 20 to Dollars 23 price talked about before the flotation.
The company said it will have 43.3m shares outstanding after the offering,
with about 49 per cent held by a unit of Consolidated Press Holdings, the
company controlled by the Australian financier Mr Kerry Packer.
Shares in The Limited, the US fashion retailer, slipped Dollars  3/4 to
Dollars 27 1/4 in very heavy trading. Home Shopping Network, a televised
24-hour shopping service, also saw heavy turnover and eased Dollars  1/8 to
Dollars 8 1/4 .
The most active blue chip issues included RJR Nabisco, up Dollars  1/8 at
Dollars 10 1/8 , Glaxo, down Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 27 1/8 , Philip Morris,
Dollars  3/8 off at Dollars 76 5/8 , and AT&T, Dollars  1/4 cheaper at
Dollars 38 1/4 .
The oil field equipment and service sector was weak, with Schlumberger
falling Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 54 7/8 , Halliburton losing Dollars 1 to
Dollars 25 3/4 and Dresser Industries slipping Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 19
7/8 .
In the secondary market, United Retail Group led trading. The stock was
quoted at Dollars 16: an initial public offering of 4.4m shares was priced
at Dollars 15 a share.
Synalloy climbed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 18 5/8 after Oppenheimer initiated
coverage of the stock with a 'buy' recommendation.
Agouron Pharmaceutical jumped Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 16 3/4 on reports
that its AG-331 drug has been effective against tumours in animal tests. The
company plans to make an investigational new drug filing later this year.
Canada
THE Toronto market dropped to its lowest level since late December on
growing concern about domestic interest rates.
The composite index fell 26.4 to 3,503.6 and declining issues outscored
advances by 371 to 192. Volume came to a heavy 33.2m shares. The gold group
was the only sector to post an appreciable gain, rising 0.72 per cent as
spot gold firmed USDollars 1.50 to Dollars 350.75 an ounce in New York.
Roman Corp had higher income from continuing operations in 1991 against
1990. The stock put on 5 cents to CDollars 2.20.
John Labatt was off CDollars  1/4 at CDollars 26 in spite of reporting
higher earnings for its third quarter and nine months.
