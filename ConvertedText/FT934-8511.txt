FT  15 NOV 93 / International Company News: Asarco to swap Medimsa holding


   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent


ASARCO, the US mining and metals group, seems to have solved the problem of
what to do with its shareholding in Medimsa, a Mexican copper company, that
it has been trying to sell for some time.
Instead, the group is to swap its 28.3 per cent stake in Medimsa for a 23.6
per cent holding in Grupo Mexico, Medimsa's publicly-traded parent and the
largest non-ferrous metals mining group in Mexico.
There will then be an international offering of Grupo Mexico shares in which
Asarco will sell some of its holding. It will also grant some of Grupo
Mexico's existing shareholders an option to buy about 9 per cent of the
Mexican company at the peso equivalent of Dollars 1.40 a share. If
exercised, the option would bring Asarco Dollars 87m.
Mr Richard Osborne, Asarco's chairman, said the immediate financial impact
on his company is likely to be immaterial.
