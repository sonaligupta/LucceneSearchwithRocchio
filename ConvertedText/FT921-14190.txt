FT  17 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Break-up of British Gas is urged


   By RALPH ATKINS


THE SEPARATION of British Gas' pipe network from its sales and marketing
operations and creation of regional gas companies by the end of the decade,
were proposed yesterday by the Liberal Democrats.
Legislation forcing British Gas to lose 60 per cent of its industrial market
share by 1997 was also suggested by Mr Simon Hughes, the party's environment
spokesman. The pipe network would form a new privately owned company.
The plans are the latest in a series by the party on breaking up the
privatised utilities and British Rail. Mr Paddy Ashdown, party leader, aims
to make Liberal Democrat policy appear more pro-market than the
Conservatives.
Mr Hughes also envisaged British Coal being privatised, with coal reserves
being controlled by one operation which would be separate from private
licensed mining companies.
Liberal Democrats did not object to privatisation of British Gas but the
form of the sell off had led to a 'tremendous abuse' of the company's market
power, Mr Hughes said.
He said the company faced a referral to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission after trying to compensate for the expected loss of its
industrial market share by charging higher prices for domestic gas users.
Liberal Democrats wanted domestic users to have a choice of gas suppliers.
