FT  13 NOV 93 / How To Spend It: Sleeping sound on English wood


   By LUCIA VAN DER POST


THE Treske Shop started in North Yorkshire as a provider of furniture made
in good solid English hardwoods such as oak, cherry, walnut, beech and ash.
There is now an outlet in London for those who like the simple lines it goes
in for.
It is particular strong on beds, with a big range of natural wood frames
with sprung slats. One of their best-sellers is the daybed photographed
above, designed by Vico Magistretti, the Italian furniture designers.
Generously proportioned, with Futon-like upholstery, it is especially
popular for those with conservatories where they can indulge in reading
novels, listening to Mozart, eating chocolates and all the other purposes
for which conservatories are ideal.
It also would work well in a bed-sit where it could double as a sofa by day
and a bed by night. The arm drops down to form a 6 ft 3 in single bed. Made
from natural ash, it comes covered in a variety of fabrics. Prices start at
Pounds 774.
The two Treske shops are at Stations Works, Thirsk, North Yorkshire YO7 4NY
and 5 Barmouth Road, Earlsfield, London SW18 2DT.
