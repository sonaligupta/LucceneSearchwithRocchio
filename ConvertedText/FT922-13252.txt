FT  13 APR 92 / Rafsanjani poised for victory over hardliners

IRAN'S President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani appeared last night to have
won a significant victory over hardliners in parliamentary elections,
allowing him to push ahead with economic reform and stronger ties with the
west.
According to early results, with counting completed in most provinces, the
president's moderate supporters appear to have won a two-thirds majority
over hardliners after last Friday's election to the 270-seat Majlis, or
parliament.
While a full tally will not be available until tonight, Mr Rafsanjani's
rivals have so far won few seats. Hojatoleslam Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, former
minister of the interior and chief among the president's opponents, won only
13,000 votes, putting him well down the list of candidates in Tehran, the
capital.
Hardliners held the majority in the outgoing Majlis, which was elected a
year before Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's death in 1989.
Voter turnout was low throughout the country, especially in Tehran, in
protest at the government's handling of the economy. Recent privatisation
and deregulation of the heavily centralised economy have led to soaring
prices and an unstable currency. The rial is worth only one-twentieth of its
pre-revolutionary value against the dollar.
