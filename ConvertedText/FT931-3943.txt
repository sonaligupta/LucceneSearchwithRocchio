FT  12 MAR 93 / Romania issues privatisation list despite doubts

ROMANIA'S privatisation authorities yesterday published a list of the first
162 candidates in a scheme designed to sell-off 2,000 small companies over
the next two years.
However, doubts were cast on plans for the privatisation of larger companies
by the new administration board of the State Ownership Fund (SOF), which
manages and owns the state's 70 per cent stake in the 6,280 commerical
companies due for privatisation.
Mr Emil Dima, the SOF's new president, said he was opposed to selling-off or
closing down medium-sized and large companies considered not viable purely
on financial grounds. He said he would even oppose shutting down the 112
black-listed enterprises which the government had identified as the chief
causes of the 'financial blockage'.
Reformers within the government have pledged to take action against the 112
companies which are contributing to the country's crippling level of
inter-enterprise arrears, estimated at more than Dollars 2.5bn.
Mr Dima, a senator representing the ruling left-wing Democratic National
Salvation Front, said: 'Some of these companies are too important to be
closed. We cannot do without them and must consider the social impact
shutting them down would have.'
Rather, the state should increase its intervention in the economy to boost
production and efficiency, he said.
The SOF said the 2,000 small companies earmarked for early privatisation
were likely to be sold chiefly via management and employee buy-outs.
Employees would have the first option on the companies and would be eligible
for some state financing state at interest rates around half the market
rate.
Companies not sold to employees are to be auctioned.
