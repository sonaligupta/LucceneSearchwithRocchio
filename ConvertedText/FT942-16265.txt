FT  11 APR 94 / Company News (This Week): Daimler shareholders hope for
comfort - Other Companies


Having been obliged to swallow a 38 per cent cut in the 1993 dividend,
announced last Thursday, Daimler-Benz shareholders will be looking forward
to more palatable news from the pride of German industry at its results
press conference tomorrow.
After a DM2bn (Dollars 1.16bn) loss at nine-months, according to US
accounting principles, the 12-month numbers should show some beneficial
effects of newly introduced cars, ditto the first quarter of this year.
Since no one expects anything from AEG or Deutsche Aerospace until next
year, much is riding on the salesmanship of Mercedes boss, Mr Helmut Werner.
