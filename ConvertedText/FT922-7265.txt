FT  19 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Switch at US securities unit


   By REUTER


PRUDENTIAL Securities Japan plans to switch from speculative market segments
and concentrate on institutional investors and large corporations, Reuters
reports.
The US group's Japanese unit, a member of the Tokyo Stock Exchange since
1988, did most of its business in Japan with small companies and individual
investors who pursued aggressive investment strategies financed on margin.
These markets have been hit by the decline of Japanese equity values from
their December 1989 high point, the Japan unit said.
The unit named Mr Michio Wakizono a managing director to oversee this shift
in Japanese equity products.
