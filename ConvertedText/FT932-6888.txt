FT  26 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Record palm oil output forecast


   By REUTER


   HAMBURG


WORLD PALM oil production is forecast to hit a record 13.4m tonnes in
calendar 1993, up 1.35m tonnes from 1992, according to Oil World, Reuter
reports from Hamburg.
Palm oil output is expected to rise 1.3m tonnes to 13m tonnes between
September 1992 and October 1993.
Some 90 per cent of the increase in production has come from Indonesia and
Malaysia, Oil World said in its report.
But an expected 800,000-tonne fall in world output of 16 other oils and fats
in 1993 has caused a switch in demand into palm oil.
China, which remained largely out of the market until March, has now
returned as a fairly heavy buyer of Indonesian and Malaysian palm oil.
The latter two countries are the only major suppliers in the market at
present.
Oil World said China should remain a large purchaser between April and
September this year because Chinese palm oil stocks are low and domestic
demand is high.
