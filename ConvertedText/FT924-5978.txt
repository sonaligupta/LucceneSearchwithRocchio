FT  24 NOV 92 / Legal Briefs: European Court to rule over Mediobanca


The first direct challenge to the European Commission over the EC Merger
Regulation has reached the European Court. The Commission ruled in December
1991 that a rise in Mediobanca's shareholding in Assicurazioni Generali from
5.98 per cent to 12.84 per cent did not fall foul of the Regulation because
it did not enable Mediobanca, alone or with others, to exercise control over
AG. The ruling mentioned an agreement between Mediobanca and Euralux, the
second largest shareholder in AG, not to sell their shares to anyone else,
but said there was no agreement for any joint exercise of voting power. This
was challenged by three minority shareholders who say there was a secret
agreement between AG, Mediobanca and Lazard Freres, Euralux's owners, to
enable Mediobanca and Euralux to gain joint control over AG, and that the
Commission was misled about the agreement and Mediobanca's control. The
minority shareholders have appealed against the Commission's refusal to
re-open proceedings, questioning its understanding of the concept of
'control' in article 3 of the Regulation.
