FT  26 OCT 92 / LBS questions Tory inflation goal


   By EDWARD BALLS


UK MONETARY policy is now too loose to enable the chancellor to achieve his
long-term goal of 2 per cent inflation and risks building up inflation,
according to a monetary policy indicator constructed by the London Business
School, Edward Balls writes.
A rise in inflation has already been factored into the LBS forecasts for the
economy. In its latest economic outlook, it predicts that retail price
inflation will fall to 3.3 per cent next year, then rise to 4.9 per cent in
1994 and 5.3 per cent in 1995.
The LBS monetary policy indicator is based on a weighted average of a number
of financial indicators: the short-term real interest rate, the change in
the exchange rate, monetary aggregates and the public-sector borrowing
requirement. LBS economists have examined the relationship between those
indicators and inflation over the past decade to see if policy is now
consistent with the chancellor's inflation target.
The indicator suggests that monetary policy was much tighter than was needed
to bring inflation down towards the end of last year and into this year.
Interest rates were still in double figures but inflation was falling fast,
so raising the real interest rate.
Sterling's recent depreciation and the fall of 2 percentage points in
interest rates since sterling left the ERM mean that policy is now too
loose. Present policies are consistent with a long-term inflation rate of
about 7 per cent, according to the LBS research.
'Achieving the 4 per cent goal would involve a considerable tightening of
monetary policy,' the report says. London Business School Economic Outlook
