FT  13 APR 94 / Oil market's eastern promise


   By ROBERT CORZINE


World consumption of energy in 2010 will be about 50 per cent higher than in
1991 because of strong economic growth in China and elsewhere in Asia,
according to a report published yesterday.
The study of world energy trends by the International Energy Agency and the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimated that growth
in energy demand outside the OECD area of industrialised countries would
increase by an average of 4 per cent a year to 2010. That compares with
overall worldwide growth of 2.1 per cent.
The report says an estimated 70 per cent increase in world gross domestic
product in the period will be the main cause of rising energy demand.
In the OECD energy demand would rise 28 per cent, but oil consumption would
increase only 18 per cent because industry and power generators are
switching to other fuels. Even so, dependence on imported oil, mainly from
the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, would increase from 58
per cent in 1991 to 70 per cent in 2010 with a long-term decline in OECD oil
output.
Oil demand in the rest of the world would rise by 3.8 per cent a year, or by
about 1m barrels a day per year. By 2010 it could reach 38m b/d, some 20m
b/d more than in 1991. The report says the big Opec oil producers in the
Middle East and Venezuela would have to double their production over the
next 16 years to meet the projected demand.
Consumption of natural gas, widely seen as the most environmentally
acceptable of the fossil fuels, will grow by 2.1 per cent a year in the OECD
and by 5.6 per cent elsewhere. World coal demand is forecast to grow by 2.1
per cent a year, with China accounting for much of the rise.
The report warns that the projected growth in worldwide energy demand
implies a 50 per cent increase in carbon dioxide emissions by 2010.
Emissions in non-OECD countries would double.
Electricity is seen as the fastest-growing form of final energy demand, with
average per capita consumption expected to double in the non-OECD area. In
Asia that would mean a jump in power generation capacity to 285 gigawatts in
2010 from less than 100 gigawatts in 1990.
