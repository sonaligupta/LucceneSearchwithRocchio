FT  25 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (America): US stocks rise on lower bond
yields and gold

Wall Street
A FALL in longer-dated bond yields and lower gold prices helped US stocks
post modest gains yesterday, despite reports that the Federal Reserve has
shifted the emphasis of monetary policy toward a raising of interest rates,
writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 14.95 at 3,507.78. The
more broadly based Standard & Poor's 500 ended up 1.89 at 447.73, while the
Amex composite finished 1.17 lower at 431.69, and the Nasdaq composite up
0.41 at 694.70. NYSE trading volume was light at 198m shares.
After last week's wild gyrations, the markets opened amid a considerable
degree of confusion and uncertainty about the near-term outlook for stocks.
That outlook appeared to darken yesterday morning when newspaper reports
said that the Fed's policy-making Open Market committee had voted at its
meeting last week to prepare for a possible increase in short-term interest
rates because of growing concern about the threat of revived inflation.
The suggestion that short-term rates could go higher would normally derail
equity market sentiment. Yet, after last Friday's 30-point decline,
investors were more inclined to buy, rather than sell, stocks. A rise in
bond prices, which brought down long yields, helped, as did a fall in gold
prices. A series of computerised buy programs also contributed to the
advance. After posting a 21-point gain mid-morning, however, the Dow slipped
back into negative territory mid-afternoon before staging a late rally.
Among individual stocks, Kellogg dropped Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 53 7/8 in
busy trading after the company said that it expected second quarter earnings
to come in about 10 per cent below the 68 cents a share earned at the same
stage of 1992. Quaker Oats, fell 1 3/8 to Dollars 72 1/2 , fell in sympathy.
Some big computer stocks were in fine form , as they continued to make up
new ground in the wake of recent surprisingly good figures from
Hewlett-Packard. IBM rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 49 3/4 , Hewlett-Packard
added Dollars 2 to Dollars 85 5/8 , and Motorola firmed Dollars 2 1/4 to
Dollars 80 1/8 . Others in the sector, however, did not fare so well.
Digital Equipment gave up Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 46 and Compaq lost Dollars
 3/8 at Dollars 57 1/2 .
On the Nasdaq market, Amgen fell Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 36 1/4 in volume
of 3.5m shares after the brokerage house, Hambrecht & Quist, lowered its
rating on the California biotechnology company's stock from 'hold' to
'sell'.
CANADA was closed for a public holiday yesterday.
