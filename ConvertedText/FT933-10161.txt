FT  05 AUG 93 / UK Company News: McKay hit by interest and refinancing
charges


MCKAY Securities, the property investor and developer, reported a fall in
pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.17m to Pounds 1.77m for the year to end-March.
Shares in the company, which last month agreed new financing arrangements
with its banks, rose 5p to 130p.
The outcome was struck after a higher interest charge of Pounds 3.89m
(Pounds 3.3m) and was further depressed by Pounds 686,000 of refinancing
costs and the effect of not capitalising development outgoings (last year
Pounds 701,000 was capitalised).
Earnings per share were 5.3p (10.4p). The interim dividend having been
passed, the proposed final of 3.5p is the sole distribution for the year -
last year's total was 6.7p.
Since the year end a supermarket in Brighton and two flats in south-west
London had been sold at prices above book value, directors said.
In addition, part of the office development at Staines, Surrey, and the
shopping development at Aldershot, Hampshire, had been let.
