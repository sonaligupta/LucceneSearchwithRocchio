FT  22 DEC 92 / TV executive to head prison service


   By ALAN PIKE and RAYMOND SNODDY


THE government's deter-mination to maintain the momentum of change in the
prison service was signalled yesterday with the surprise appointment of Mr
Derek Lewis, a television executive, to run it.
Mr Lewis, 46, chairman of UK Gold Television, the satellite station, and
former chief executive of Granada Group, takes over as director-general next
month. He will become chief executive in April, when the service is
relaunched as a Next Steps agency at arm's length from the government.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, said he believed Mr Lewis, with his
business background, was 'best equipped to manage the process of change'
needed in the service. In spite of his lack of Civil Service experience, Mr
Lewis will become the home secretary's chief adviser on prisons.
Union leaders and prison reform organisations last night expressed concern
about Mr Lewis's selection. The Association of First Division Civil Servants
said it 'looked like a political appointment by the home secretary'.
Shadow Home secretary Mr Tony Blair last night attacked Mr Lewis's salary of
Pounds 125,000 a year, plus 35 per cent performance-related supplements.
He said the salary with bonuses could amount to Pounds 167,000 a year,
almost three times the amount paid to the Director General of Prisons, who
earns Pounds 63,000 a year.
The prison service has traditionally been run as a highly centralised Civil
Service department and dominated locally by the Prison Officers'
Association, its trade union.
Mr Lewis's appointment is the latest government move to shake up these
arrangements. Britain now has two privately managed prisons, and the public
and private sectors are preparing bids to manage Strangeways prison,
Manchester.
