FT  08 NOV 94 / UK Company News: L&G US subsidiary faces Dollars 8.75m fine


   By ALISON SMITH


Banner Life, a US subsidiary of Legal & General, is facing the prospect of
an Dollars 8.75m (Pounds 5.33m) fine and payment of compensation to
investors as a result of action taken by the Texas Department of Insurance.
This could also lead to the revocation of the insurer's licence to do
business in Texas.
Banner Life denies that there has been any significant mis-selling of its
policies and is planning to contest the action.
The US regulator's concern has focused on the sale of 'universal life'
policies to people over the age of 65.
These are term assurance - or protection only - policies where a lump sum
premium is paid and a sum at least 2.5 times that amount is paid when the
investor dies.
The regulator says that hundreds of customers wrongly thought they were
buying a savings investment plan.
Banner Life admits mis-selling has taken place in a few instances, but says
it has already paid compensation in the cases identified so far.
The next stage of the process is a formal hearing at the Texas Office of
Administrative Hearings: a decision is not expected for six months or so.
There have been several actions at state level against the sales practices
of insurers. The recommended fine is a record for Texas.
L&G said that universal life policies represented only about 5 per cent of
Banner Life's business in terms of premium income.
