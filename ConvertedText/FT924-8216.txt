FT  12 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Wardell Roberts falls to IPounds 1.27m
despite sale


   By MATTHEW CURTIN


WARDELL ROBERTS, the Irish Foods group, reported a fall in first half
pre-tax profits from IPounds 1.33m to IPounds 1.27m (Pounds 1.39m) as tough
trading conditions offset the disposal of Country Style, its loss-making UK
poultry business.
Turnover was virtually unchanged at IPounds 20m at the core businesses, but
operating profit fell to IPounds 1.39m (IPounds 1.53m). Interest payments
were reduced to IPounds 116,000 (IPounds 199,000).
Earnings per share on the increased capital dipped to 4p (4.4p). The interim
dividend is maintained at 1.27p.
Mr Ken Peare, chief executive, said shareholders could take comfort from the
unchanged dividend, a sign of the strength of the balance sheet - debt was
being consistently reduced - and its healthy cashflow.
The group did not expect any improvement in the current half, but was still
on the look-out for acquisitions.
He said Wardell had been able to keep increases in fixed costs below the
rate of inflation, but higher marketing costs, associated with long-term
development of health food brands in the UK, had knocked operating profit.
Sales at the Healthilife subsidiary in the UK rose 12 per cent, while
turnover improved 5 per cent at Kelkin Naturproducts, the Irish health food
division. The joint venture with KP performed well, but the tea and coffee
retail business was affected by lower sales and tighter margins.
