FT  16 JAN 92 / International Company News: Daiwa, Bankers Trust advise
Rosneftegas


   By ANTHONY ROBINSON, East Europe Editor


BANKERS Trust, the US merchant bank, and Daiwa Europe, the European arm of
the Japanese investment banking house, have been appointed joint financial
advisers to the Russian Oil and Gas Corporation (Rosneftegas).
They will assist in planning and implementing a comprehensive
re-organisation of the industry into competing, vertically integrated oil
companies open to foreign investment and technical assistance.
The corporation, which groups together the 47 main Russian oil production,
exploration and related service enterprises, was responsible for about 90
per cent of the estimated 500m tons of oil produced in the former Soviet
Union last year. It is essentially a reincarnation, under the guise of a
joint stock company, of the former Ministry of Oil and Gas Industry which it
replaced in October 1991.
The decision to involve leading US and Japanese bankers as advisers in the
re-organisation of the ailing industry reflects the top priority given to
raising the efficiency of the Russian oil and gas industry.
Production has declined by around 100m tonnes over the past three years. A
report prepared for the Russian government by Moscow's Institute of World
Economy and International Relations predicted this week that Russian oil
output could fall to between 280m-300m tonnes by the mid-1990s.
It blamed low investment, poor extraction techniques and maintenance,
out-dated equipment and poor management.
