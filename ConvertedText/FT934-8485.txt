FT  15 NOV 93 / Status quo for Puerto Rico


   By REUTER


   SAN JUAN


PUERTO Rico's pro-statehood Governor Pedro Rossello last night conceded
defeat in the island's plebiscite on whether to become the 51st US state,
Reuter reports from San Juan.
The concession came four hours after the polls closed and with about half
the vote counted. In a high turnout of the 2.3m voters, about 46 per cent
backed statehood while more than 48 per cent voted for the Caribbean island
to remain a US commonwealth. About four per cent were in favour of becoming
an independent country.
