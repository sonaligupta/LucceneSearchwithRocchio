FT  10 JAN 92 / International Company News: Nobel to sell consumer goods
unit to Henkel


   By ROBERT TAYLOR


   STOCKHOLM


NOBEL Industries, the Swedish chemicals and defence group, is selling its
consumer goods division to Henkel, the German chemicals group best known for
its range of washing powders.
The divestment will mean an increase in Nobel's own capital of around
SKr2bn, with a net profit of SKr150m (Dollars 27m) from the transaction.
Mr Ove Mattesson, chief executive at Nobel Industries, said the sale would
improve the Swedish group's own financial position and was in line with
Nobel's stated policy of concentrating its activities in those sectors with
the best long-term growth possibilities.
The company made a SKr1.5bn loss for the first eight months of 1991, mainly
because it was forced to write-off SKr1.8bn of its equity in the finance
company Gamlestaden, which collapsed last August.
The consumer goods division achieved a SKr2.6bn turnover last year which
accounted for 9 per cent of Nobel's group sales and for 14 per cent of its
SKr1.04bn profits (after financial items). It is involved mainly in the
manufacture of chemical-technical products for cleaning and polishing as
well as hygiene care.
Mr Mattesson said Nobel lacked the financial resources to carry out the
structural changes and expansion within the consumer goods market but he
added Henkel would be in a good position to improve its growth.
The German group, which employs 42,000 workers had a SKr47bn turnover last
year. It is strong not just in Germany but also in Italy, France and Spain.
The acquisition of Nobel's consumer goods gives it a first foothold in the
Nordic market.
