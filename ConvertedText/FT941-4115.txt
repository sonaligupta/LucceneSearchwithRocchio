FT  12 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Thorn wanted


   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON


An upbeat note from Hoare Govett helped Thorn EMI stay in positive
territory, the shares edging forward 3 to 1118p. The broker said that the
potential recovery upside in the music industry, rising margins in the US
record market and Thorn's position as software supplier in the unfolding
multimedia revolution all warranted further investor exposure to the stock.
Leisure analyst Mr Hamish Dickson added: 'Thorn shares still trade at
substantial discounts to their peers in the media/entertainment sector. But
as this is increasingly viewed in global terms, we believe Thorn's rating
will rise to eliminate this anomaly.'
Fresh downward pressure on index-linked gilts triggered further selling of
the 'recs' which showed Eastern 11 1/2 off at 613 1/2 p and Southern 20
lower at 615p.
Severn Trent, given a midweek boost by Credit Lyonnais Laing, was the most
resilient of the water stocks, closing 2 firmer at 556p.
A general restructuring of gilt yields also increased the pressure on the
equity market's other high-yielding stocks, such as BT. The latter dropped
13 to 412 1/2 p on turnover of 8.1m. British Gas fell 5 to 301p.
Enterprise Oil fell 10 to 411p on further consideration of the preliminary
results, but BP held up well to close only a fraction easier at 351p on
turnover of 10m shares.
Lloyds Bank suffered from bouts of profit-taking, closing 14 off at 564p as
did Royal Bank of Scotland, 16 weaker at 428p while the hefty losses on the
Hong Kong market kept the pressure on Standard Chartered, 9 lower at 1113p
and HSBC, 26 off at 833p.
Willis Corroon's excellent figures continued to sustain the shares which ran
up 4 more to 227p. Disappointment over figures from advertising agency
Abbott Mead Vickers saw the shares fall 22 to 708p. The group announced a
1993 profit of Pounds 4.75m, up 0.6 per cent, and said it was confident
about future prospects.
Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel fell 29 to 561p in London and slumped 3.6
per cent in Paris after press reports raised concerns about the starting
date for the passenger service. Eurotunnel said a French newspaper report
that the service might not start before the autumn was 'pure speculation'
and no opening date had been fixed. After the market closed Eurotunnel said
the state opening of the tunnel would take place on May 6 but it declined to
elaborate on passenger traffic timing.
Textiles group Coats Viyella improved 4 to 266p ahead of results on
Wednesday. The market is expecting profits of between Pounds 143m and Pounds
150m, up from Pounds 109.1m in 1992.
Positive recommendations from two securities houses failed to prevent
engineering group TI from sliding with the market. Agency broker James Capel
upgraded its recommendation from hold to buy and BZW was also enthusiastic.
However, TI has a significant exposure to the US and the weakness in the Dow
saw the shares close 9 off at 400p.
Reed International which is also heavily exposed to the US fell 19 to 880p
ahead of full-year figures on Thursday.
Reuters Holdings slid 50p to 2048p after Merrill Lynch downgraded the stock
to neutral from buy in the intermediate term. Analyst Mr Neil Barton said he
still rated the company as a long-term buy, but the share price had risen
too fast.
Leading pharmaceutical stocks were holding their own after a bout of
weakness earlier in the week. Glaxo was unchanged at 661p and Wellcome,
which is to report first-half figures on March 24, rose a penny to 627p.
However, Goldman Sachs argues that concerns over the headline drugs Zovirax
and Retrovir will lead to further weakness in the shares.
Rolls-Royce held steady at 179 1/2 p with the support of a buy
recommendation from Williams de Broe.
