FT  04 MAR 94 / Survey of World Tyre Industry (2): Giving new life to rubber
dumps - John Griffiths discusses ways of reducing the growing mountain of
scrap tyres


   By JOHN GRIFFITHS


The global pile of several billion worn-out tyres is growing day by day and
is fast becoming an environmental problem of significant dimensions.
If these tyres lie around long enough, they can leech a variety of
contaminants into the soil and eventually into water supplies. Occasionally,
tyre dumps catch fire. And when they do, they can be almost impossible to
put out. One in Wales is still burning after eight years.
Dumped tyres also represent a profligate waste of natural resources, for two
main reasons. One is that, provided it has not been damaged in use, the
complicated, stress-bearing carcass which forms the heart of a tyre usually
remains sound even if the tread has worn away. The other is that the
oil-based nature of the various tread compounds and fabrics represents a
potentially valuable energy source, or raw material for other uses.
An increasing amount of attention is thus being focused on ways to minimise
this waste. One obvious route is to make tyres last longer, resulting in
fewer tyres being produced. Thirty years ago the tyre industry virtuously
shot itself in the foot by introducing radial tyres which overnight doubled
the average tyre's life to around 40,000 miles. Today, leading participants
in the industry are using an 80,000-mile guarantee as a marketing tool.
But vehicle population continues to rise, so recycling in one form or
another is an increasingly unavoidable necessity.
At present, around 15 per cent of car tyres are retreaded, and returned for
sale in the cheapest sectors of the replacement market, although this figure
can vary widely from country to country. This figure is much lower than that
for truck tyres, more than half of which are retreaded.
In Brussels, the European Commission is seeking to increase the proportion
of car tyres retreaded to around 30 per cent. Achieving this, according to
industry estimates, would reduce by around 60m gallons the quantity of crude
oil used in production each year.
At that level of retreading, it is likely that the leading tyre makers would
become more interested in establishing more substantive 'in-house'
retreading operations. At present the big tyre makers undertake these
activities on a relatively small scale. Retreading has traditionally
provided business opportunities for small, independent companies.
The perception in the minds of many consumers that retreaded tyres might be
of suspect quality and performance has become outdated since strict quality
standards were imposed. Indeed, the UK's Durham-based Colway Tyres, which
retreads around 1m of the 4m discarded tyres it collects each year, is
actively using high performance as a promotional weapon. It has moved into
the highest speed-rated H and V tyre sectors, carved a unique niche as a
rally tyre supplier and recently has been approved as a supplier for junior
single-seat racing cars.
According to Mr Bob Bonomy, Colway's managing director, each retreaded tyre
represents a production saving of up to four gallons of crude oil compared
with a new tyre.
Colway's own output indicates the dimensions of the recycling problem. It
rejects three casings for every one remoulded, which means that 'finding new
ways of recycling scrap tyres not suitable for remoulding has become part of
our corporate strategy'.
One answer is the collaborative venture Colway has developed with Duralay, a
subsidiary of motor components and engineering group BBA. A tyre-shredding
and storage facility next to the remoulding plant turns the rubber into
'crumb' which Duralay makes into carpet underlay. However, since there is no
prospect of carpeting much of the earth's land mass, Mr Bonomy stresses that
underlay can only be a small part of the solution.
Another potential solution is to use the 'crumb' in large-scale enterprises
such as road construction. Inclusion of about 15 per cent 'crumb' in asphalt
would increase the life of a road surface by 15 to 22 years. The snag is
that the cost of the asphalt rises by 50 per cent to 100 per cent. However,
the picture might improve if Europe were to follow the example in some
states of the US which have legislated 'crumb' must be used to improve
drainage and skid resistance.
None of these solutions, however, has as much potential as the idea of
providing a power source from incineration of tyres.
Such a prospect is not as noxious as it sounds in terms of air quality, and
late last year a landmark was reached when Elm Energy, a US joint venture,
was granted permission to open Europe's first tyre-incineration power
station in the UK.
The Wolverhampton facility burns at a temperature of 950 degrees C tyres
which, on average, contain the energy equivalent of 12 cu m of natural gas.
The closed incineration system, already in use in North America, means that
virtually no gaseous pollutants escape.
Elm Energy - formed by Nipsco, an Indiana utility group, and the Performance
Service Corporation of Connecticut - claims it can consume around 5m of the
UK's 25m tyres scrapped annually.
