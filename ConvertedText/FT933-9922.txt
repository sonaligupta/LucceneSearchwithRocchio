FT  06 AUG 93 / International Company News: Commerzbank may sell shares in
DBV to Swiss


   By ANDREW FISHER


   FRANKFURT


ZURICH Insurance Group has been holding talks with Commerzbank over the
possible purchase of a large minority stake in a German insurance concern
with premium income of some DM3bn (Dollars 1.8m).
Commerzbank owns a 48 per cent stake in Deutsche Beamtenversicherung (DBV),
the subject of the talks.
However, Mr Martin Kohlhaussen, the bank's chief executive, said earlier
this year it intended to reduce this to 25 per cent.
The bank, one of Germany's largest, would neither confirm nor deny talks
with the Swiss group.
Zurich, which has made clear its desire to expand in Germany, confirmed
talks, but gave no details.
Mr Kohlhaussen has indicated that a foreign partner for Wiesbaden-based DBV,
quoted on the Frankfurt stock market, would be desirable to help the
expansion of the business.
Such a move would also give Zurich, which has a branch in Frankfurt and owns
the Agrippina insurance in Cologne, greater access to the German market.
No price has been mentioned. Zurich said a valuation of DBV was under way.
DBV is valued at some DM2bn on the stock market, but its DM3bn volume of
premium income means the stake sought by Zurich could be worth about DM700m.
A deal with Zurich Insurance would fit in with Commerzbank's strategy of
developing its Allfinanz (financial services) activities through
partnerships rather than outright ownership.
Its links with DBV and Leonberger Bausparkasse, a mortgage savings and loan
company in which it owns 40 per cent, have added considerably to its overall
business.
