FT  25 MAR 92 / FT Survey of TEC Board Members: Concern over accountability
and freedom to spend funds


   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff


THE URGENT need for the next government to examine its relationship with
Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs) is highlighted today in a survey by
the Financial Times.
The survey shows some satisfaction with the progress of Tecs, set up under
the Tories to bring a new impetus to training and enterprise initiatives,
but there is widespread dissatisfaction over the levels of government
funding and the freedom enjoyed by business executives in how they spend
Tecs' money.
The findings call into question how a future government could achieve a
better balance between preserving the public accountability of Tecs, which
spend more than Pounds 2bn of government funds, and giving them the freedom
they believe they need to operate effectively.
The survey of senior managers, union representatives and public-sector
executives is the first to bring together such a wide range of opinion among
men and women appointed to bring a new impetus to training initiatives in
Britain.
There are 82 Tecs in England and Wales and they represent one of the
government's most radical experiments in public-private partnerships.
About 433 of the 882 Tec board members responded to the survey. Sixty-nine
per cent were private-sector executives, who make up the majority on boards,
6 per cent were union representatives and 24 per cent were public-sector
executives. About 3 per cent did not define their status. (Sets of
percentages in the article do not add up to 100 due to rounding up.)
The majority, 88 per cent, had been with their Tec for more than a year, and
85 per cent attended all regular board meetings. More than half devoted up
to three hours a week to Tec work. Over 20 per cent of private-sector
members devoted more than six hours a week.
Tec boards are voluntary and the boards must be made up of senior
individuals from the public and private sectors.
Many Tecs have had difficulty in recruiting personnel of the right calibre,
and the survey finds that about 41 per cent of private-sector members have
limited their commitment to a further two years or less. This might cause
the movement difficulties with a diminished pool of executives to draw on.
Some board members surveyed suggest recruitment to boards from lower
management levels.
On overall satisfaction with the progress of Tecs - most of which have been
operating for little over a year - 26 per cent were very satisfied, 67 per
cent were satisfied and 7 per cent were very dissatisfied. Union
representatives, who would lobby a future Labour government for greater
representation on Tec boards, had a greater proportion of those who were
very dissatisfied.
Nearly 80 per cent said Tecs should be the subject of minor evolutionary
reform, 15 per cent drastic reform and 2 per cent said they should be
abolished. Again union representatives were the most critical.
Tecs have been engaged in tough negotiations over the past two years, since
the first 10 were established, over their desire for greater flexibility in
how they spend the money the government allocates to them to administer and
deliver Youth Training (YT), Employment Training (ET), the scheme for
unemployed adults, and local initiatives including promoting the training of
people in work.
About 95 per cent in the survey said they wanted more flexibility with no
great variation among the three constituencies of board members. One Tec
board member wrote: 'I do not see how businessmen of any calibre will
continue to tolerate the suffocating and un-necessary bureaucracy.'
While 72 per cent said that in principle employers should shoulder more of
the cost of training young people, 82 per cent said the government's
spending was too low, with that view shared by 77 per cent of private-sector
representatives. Spending on YT in England was Pounds 711m in 1991-92 and
for 1992-93 is planned at Pounds 707m. For ET it was Pounds 668m in 1991-92
and is planned at Pounds 659m for 1992-93.
Tecs, asked to comment on the consequences of the cuts in expenditure for
1992-93, gave grave forecasts. Answers included:
The business community will lose confidence in Tecs' ability to deliver.
There will be a crisis of confidence among training providers.
It will endanger our plans to improve quality and deliver more
qualifications.
There will be a severe impact on specialist needs training and our ability
to 'up-skill the workforce'.
Government will only have one more year left before sufficient
disillusionment sets in to produce mass resignations of directors.
Asked about the importance of the two main training programmes a greater
percentage of directors believed YT was 'very important' than said the same
of ET - 64 per cent and 39 per cent respectively. However, 80 per cent said
the promotion of in-company training was very important. Many Tec directors
wrote that one of the main weaknesses of Tecs was the emphasis on YT and ET
and not on people in work, and that Tecs lacked effective communications
with employers.
Tec directors also wanted more government funding for promoting enterprise
activities, which many said was a priority for them. About 73 per cent
wanted to assume all the small business responsibilities of the Department
of Trade and Industry.
Tecs and Chambers of Commerce, which deliver some DTI business
advice-services, have had an uneasy relationship, although some Tecs are
establishing working relationships with chambers. Boards were lukewarm over
whether Tecs should merge with chambers.
Tecs were wary of any moves to introduce greater centralisation into a
movement which they describe as 'bottom-up'. About 69 per cent objected to
any increase in the powers of the National Training Task Force, a voluntary
group of top businessmen which advises government on training issues.
Boards also opposed one of the centrepieces of Labour's proposals for Tecs:
the establishment of a central tripartite body, probably on the lines of the
old Manpower Services Commission which brought together employers, unions
and the public sector to decide on training policy. About 62 per cent of
board members opposed such a move with the private sector most strongly
opposed.
The introduction of a training levy on companies that do not train is
another central plank of Labour's policies. Business is generally perceived
as being opposed to such a move but 37 per cent of business executives were
in favour.
More than 70 per cent of business executives said that if Labour formed the
next government the effect would be either positive (20 per cent) or neutral
(52 per cent) suggesting that they like Labour's promises of restoring cuts
to training budgets, but are not so keen about new statutory controls.
Government wants Tecs to forge close links with education. About 31 per cent
of respondents to the survey said relationships with schools were very
satisfactory, 53 per cent said satisfactory and 15 per cent were
dissatisfied. Public-sector officers were the least unsatisfied.
Tecs are operating a new programme called Investors in People which is a
kitemark awarded to companies assessed to have the right mechanisms in place
to be good training organisations and investors in their workforces. The
number of awards is low at present but 39 per cent of respondents were very
satisfied with progress to date, 51 per cent were satisfied and 36 per cent
were unsatisfied.
