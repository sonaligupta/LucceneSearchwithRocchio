FT  02 NOV 93 / New powers for child agency


SINGLE MOTHERS struggling to bring up children on benefit may be able to
jump a three-year queue for maintenance assessments, the government
announced yesterday.
The controversial Child Support Agency, set up in April, has been given new
powers to deal with urgent cases.
The announcement from Mr Alistair Burt, social security minister, received a
lukewarm welcome from pressure groups. They said the reforms of the agency -
responsible for the assessment, collection and enforcement of maintenance
payments from fathers - had not addressed fundamental flaws.
The Commons social security committee is to examine claims that the agency
concentrates on fathers who already pay towards the upkeep of their
families, rather than chasing runaway fathers.
