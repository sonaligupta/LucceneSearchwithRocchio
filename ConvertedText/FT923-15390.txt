FT  02 JUL 92 / Bidder pulls out of Channel 5 race


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


THE Entertainment Channel yesterday formally decided not to bid for the
Channel 5 licence.
The company formed by Mr David Frost, the television presenter, and Mr
Jeremy Fox, the independent producer, said on Tuesday it would continue to
explore a possible bid for the new channel. The company had suffered when
two potential shareholders, TV-am and Mr Conrad Black, chairman of the Daily
Telegraph group, decided not to go ahead.
Yesterday Mr Fox, who would have been chief executive of the channel if the
company had won the licence, decided against making a bid.
The main reason for the decision was the growing realisation that the
programmes they could afford to produce would not be good enough to persuade
sufficient people to buy the new aerial that will probably be needed in most
parts of the country to receive a clear picture.
The decision means it is now increasingly likely that only one significant
bid will be received by the Independent Television Commission when bids
close on Tuesday, and that it will be the minimum of Pounds 1,000 a year.
The bid, now being led in effect by Mr Richard Dunn, chief executive of
Thames Television, will be in the name of Channel 5 Holdings. This new
company takes in both the investors and the concept associated with Five TV.
That is based on a core of programmes transmitted nationally but
supplemented by local programmes opting out of the national output.
The shareholders include Sony Pictures and CanWest, a Canadian-based
international broadcaster.
