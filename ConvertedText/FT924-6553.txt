FT  20 NOV 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report


   By REUTER


London's robusta COFFEE futures finished with gains of up to Dollars 15 as
the market seemed to have resumed its upward trend after a recent downside
technical correction. Dealers said a 50 per cent retracement had been
completed in New York's March arabica contract, which earlier this week rose
to a high of 74.10 cents a lb from 64.30 cents last week and then slipped
back to a low on Wednesday of 69.20 cents. In the short term, however, the
market looks unlikely to move sharply in either direction ahead of next
week's ICO talks. London COCOA prices closed mostly higher. News that the
Ivorian prime minister's office had estimated the 1992-93 cocoa crop at
780,000 tonnes was above trade expectations and seen as mildly bearish. BASE
METAL prices closed mixed on the LME, concluding a generally lacklustre
session of few features. Dealers said early price rises ran out of steam,
with fundamental factors unable to provide a follow-through to technical
advances.
