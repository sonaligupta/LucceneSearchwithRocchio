FT  23 JUL 93 / The Maastricht Vote: EC partners are confused over
Westminster wrangle


   By Our Political Staff


THERE WAS confusion among Britain's European Community partners last night
over the complexities of the Westminster battle over the Maastricht treaty.
There was no comment from the Brussels headquarters of the EC Commission. Mr
Jacques Delors, Commission president, had told officials to say nothing
which could prejudice the chances of a deal to complete the treaty's passage
through the Commons.
But the vote served to renew worries in the rest of the EC about Britain's
commitment to the community.
The UK's embassy to the EC said it had had many calls from journalists
seeking explanations about the domestic politics involved in ratifying the
treaty. An official said: 'We are finding it difficult to put it across in a
way which is immediately accessible.'
Mr Leo Tindemanns, former Belgium foreign minister, was 'sad' at last
night's outcome. He said the rebellion in the government ranks 'looks from
Brussels like an attempt to commit suicide by the Conservative party'.
Mr Major's decision to put the government's future on the line over
Maastricht with a confidence vote did win approval from one EC official, who
said: 'He is putting his money where his mouth is. He is showing that he is
prepared to stake his government on a European issue of fundamental
importance.'
Lord Rees-Mogg, who is challenging ratification of the Maastricht treaty in
the High Court, said his case had been strengthened by events in the
Commons. Speaking on BBC2's Newsnight programme, he said: 'This great
parliamentary confusion seems to me to arise basically because the
government didn't decide right from the beginning that a referendum was
necessary for so great a constitutional change.'
