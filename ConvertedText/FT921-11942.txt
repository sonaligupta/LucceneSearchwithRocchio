FT  29 JAN 92 / Mexican governor resigns


   By DAMIAN FRASER


   MEXICO CITY


THE governor of the Mexican state of Tabasco has resigned after charges of
fraudulent municipal elections and growing unpopularity within his party.
Mr Salvador Neme Castillo becomes the third governor or governor-elect from
the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI) to resign since August.
He will be replaced by the current senator from Tabasco who, while also from
the governing party, is considered more conciliatory.
The resignation of Mr Neme Castillo - almost certainly at the approval or
behest of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari - is likely to send a strong
warning to sitting governors and aspirants that obviously fraudulent
elections or a weak and divided party will not be tolerated.
On January 12, in apparent recognition of the fraud and in response to a
20,000-strong demonstration by the opposition in Mexico City, the government
annulled the disputed elections and handed over the city of Cardenas to the
left-wing Party of Democratic Revolution.
