FT  19 APR 94 / World Trade News: Taiwan power deal


   By ANDREW BAXTER


KWU, the Siemens power generating equipment business, has won a contract
worth almost DM1bn (Pounds 400m) to equip the Hsinta power station, to be
built near the city of Tainan on Taiwan's south-west coast.
The contract, won against stiff international competition, is for a 2,364MW
gas-fired combined cycle power station, which Siemens says will be the
largest plant in countries with 60-cycle (Hz) networks - North America and
parts of Asia.
Siemens said the contract, from the Taiwan Power Company (TPC), made it the
leading supplier of combined-cycle technology to Taiwan. It was a result of
its increased orientation towards the south-east Asian market.
The Hsinta plant, due for completion in 1998, will have 15 gas and five
steam turbines, 20 generators, and 15 heat-recovery steam generators.
