FT  10 JAN 92 / UK Company News: MCC pension confusion persists


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


THE MAXWELL Communication Corporation pension fund is in such a mess that no
sensible estimates are yet available on its financial status. It is not even
clear precisely who is covered by the fund although the total is believed to
be about 4,600 people, writes Raymond Snoddy.
The confusion has been increased by the number of bulk transfers of
pensioners from one fund to another as the late Mr Robert Maxwell bought and
sold companies within MCC and reorganised its structure.
The Law Debenture Trust Corporation, the investment trust company called in
to MCC on December 10 to sort out the debris, is now trying to find out what
should have been in the pension fund. Auditors are due to report by the end
of next month. Work is also being carried out on what the future liabilities
of the fund are expected to be and the activities of Bishopsgate Investment
Management, the company in the Maxwell private empire which managed most of
the fund's assets.
It may be several months before a clear picture emerges of the present state
of the fund.
All the Law Debenture Trust could say yesterday was: 'We are determined to
see the scheme is put back into funds.'
Ordinary MCC pensioners will continue to receive their pensions but a range
of restrictions have been imposed on the scheme for the time being.
No new applicants are being accepted into the fund and there is a moratorium
on bulk transfers in or out of the scheme.
Members retiring now are unable to take part of their pension as a tax-free
lump sum because this would amount to a preferential call on what could turn
out to be limited resources.
MCC was Mr Maxwell's main quoted vehicle with debts almost certainly greatly
exceeding assets.
