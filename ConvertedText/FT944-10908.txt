FT  08 NOV 94 / On guard


An Israeli border policeman stands yesterday at the door of the Isaac Hall
in the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron, the scene in February of the
killing by an Israeli settler of 30 Palestinians. Workmen were carrying out
final repairs before the hall was reopened yesterday for worship by Jews and
Moslems, amid tight security.
