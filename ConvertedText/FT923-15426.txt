FT  02 JUL 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool


The better finish to the Australian selling season has given much needed
encouragement to wool buyers. Some believe it presages latent demand which
will emerge when the new season starts on July 28. Early offerings will be
relatively lighter and prices might tend firm to higher. The crossbred
market is patchy, with no significant pointers from the final New Zealand
sale. In Bradford business remains very quiet and top quotations have
declined slightly. The AWC market indicator at the end of the season was
545, compared with 577 in June 10.
