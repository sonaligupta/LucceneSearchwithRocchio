FT  22 APR 91 / Women managers


THE small number of women managers in industry was highlighted yesterday by
Ms Gina King, head of the Industrial Society's equal-opportunities unit.
'The fact that recent estimates claim women fill only 1 per cent of top
management posts and 4-5 per cent of senior and middle management jobs is a
disgrace,' she said.
