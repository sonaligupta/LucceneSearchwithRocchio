FT  07 JAN 94 / Croats face pressure on Bosnia

   BERLIN, BELGRADE


The presidents of Croatia and Bosnia will meet tomorrow in Bonn in a move
aimed at reaching agreement on an agenda for peace talks which re-open in
Geneva next week.
Presidents Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia and Franjo Tudjman of Croatia will
hold talks with Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the international
peace negotiations at Petersberg, the German government's official guest
house. German officials, who yesterday said they were surprised about being
asked to host the discussions, said they might help pave the way for
progress at the Geneva peace talks.
However an angry Mr Izetbegovic yesterday demanded the UN Security Council
stop a rebel Serb assault on Sarajevo, a daily bombardment he said the world
watched in silence. His demand came after the fiercest fighting in months
killed eight people and wounded at least 61.
In Washington US officials warned that air strikes against Serbian forces
was a 'live option' in view of the intense bombardment of Sarajevo.
A German diplomat said growing international pressure on Croatia to stop
interfering in the war in Bosnia, as well as continuing sanctions on Serbia,
might lead to some compromises. 'We need a political settlement. But all
three sides must be ready for it.' Croatia yesterday said it would present
new proposals for peace in Bosnia at the weekend summit but Zagreb's
ambassador to Germany, did not specify what they would be.
Lord Owen and Mr Stoltenberg yesterday warned that the war in Bosnia was
stunting economic and political development in eastern Europe
On a diplomatic shuttle in the run-up to the resumption of peace talks, Lord
Owen called on Hungary to exert pressure on its southern neighbours to end
the war.
