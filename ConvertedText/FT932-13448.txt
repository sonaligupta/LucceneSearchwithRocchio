FT  23 APR 93 / Radiated soil to be removed


   By DAVID OWEN


THE GOVERNMENT is to remove soil contaminated by radiation from the
Aldermaston, Berks, headquarters of Blue Circle Cement as a result of a 1989
accident at the adjoining Atomic Weapons Establishment.
Mr Jonathan Aitken, minister of defence procurement, said last night the
contamination was 'well below levels which could cause any harm to
individuals'.
Ministers were first told of the contamination in April 1991.
The disclosure, which followed reports that Blue Circle Cement was moving
150 employees from its headquarters, came in a response to a written
question by Mr Llew Smith, Labour MP for Blaenau Gwent.
