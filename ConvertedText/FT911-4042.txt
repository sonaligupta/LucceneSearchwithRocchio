FT  22 APR 91 / Lord Aldington in libel costs deal


   By JOHN HUNT


SUN ALLIANCE insurance company, the UK's biggest household insurer, will
disclose in its annual report and accounts today that it has given an
interest-free loan, estimated at Pounds 500,000, to Lord Aldington, its
former chairman. The loan is to cover the legal costs of his nine-week libel
case against Count Nikolai Tolstoy in 1989.
The directors justify the decision on the grounds that the case arose from
his duties as the company's chairman.
Earlier this month Sun Alliance reported a 1990 loss of Pounds 181m due to
claims arising from bad weather and the recession.
The loan to Lord Aldington is repayable if he recovers costs. The legal bill
has been estimated at Pounds 500,000 plus other expenses of about Pounds
100,000.
The company says that Mr Nigel Watts, a Kent Property developer and a
co-defendant in the libel action, had claimed that Sun Alliance wrongly
refused to pay a Pounds 50,000 accident policy after his brother-in-law died
in 1975.
At the trial Lord Aldington's counsel said there had been a 'disgraceful
campaign' to force Sun Alliance to reverse its decision over the insurance
claim.
The court was told Mr Watts had circulated 10,000 copies of a pamphlet,
written by Count Tolstoy, attacking Lord Adlington's war record.
It alleged that as a senior officer in Austria at the end of the second
world war he repatriated thousands of Cossacks and anti-Tito Yugoslavs to
the Communists knowing they faced torture and death.
At the end of the trial Lord Aldington, a former deputy chairman of the
Conservative party, was awarded record Pounds 1.5m damages plus costs but
neither Count Tolstoy nor Mr Watts were able to pay that sum.
