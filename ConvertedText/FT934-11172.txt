FT  02 NOV 93 / Observer: Panoramic view


Former KGB major-general Oleg Kalugin had reason to fear arrest throughout
most of his eminent spying career, not least during his stint as a Soviet
agent in the US. His escape from punishment at the hands of the KGB itself,
when he publicly exposed its ruthless methods in 1990, was also something of
a feat. So he can't have been expecting the handcuffs to snap shut at
Heathrow airport over the weekend as he tried to slip into Britain on a
brief visit.
Kalugin may not have been up to his old spying tricks, but the British
authorities could have been unsettled by his latest counter-espionage
mission - taking up the invitation of the BBC's Panorama programme to talk
about MI6.
Perhaps they were serving Kalugin, who was later released, a none-too-subtle
hint that the kind of frankness he had demonstrated in exposing the KGB's
deeds was less than welcome in the west.
Alternatively, Kalugin's troubles may date back to the interview he gave to
The Mail on Sunday in April. Therein, he took it upon himself to spill the
beans as to how the KGB had supplied Bulgarian 'colleagues' with the
infamous umbrella that fired poisoned pellets to kill a dissident in London
15 years ago.
Kalugin described the weapon in detail; he also revealed that it had been
tested by his department first on a horse, which died, and on a man, who
didn't.
