FT  27 SEP 94 / International Company News: Chrysler unit adds lawsuit to
Castor pile


   By BERNARD SIMON


   TORONTO


The pile of lawsuits surrounding Castor Holdings, the Montreal-based
property finance group which collapsed in 1992, has grown further with a
CDollars 200m (USDollars 149m) claim by Chrysler's Canadian subsidiary
against a Toronto-based trust company which acted as custodian for
Chrysler's pension funds.
Chrysler Canada's pension fund was the biggest single creditor of Castor,
which was created by Mr Wolfgang Stoltzenberg, the German-Canadian
financier, as a tax-sheltered vehicle for European investors to share in the
1980s North American property boom. Many of Castor's investments were in
high-risk second and third mortgages.
Castor's creditors have submitted claims of about CDollars 1.3bn against the
estate. However, the chances of them retrieving anything are negligible.
The creditors and Castor's bankruptcy trustee have also launched numerous
legal proceedings, notably against Coopers & Lybrand, Castor's auditors. The
claims against Coopers total more than CDollars 900m.
Chrysler Canada claims that National Trust is responsible for losses
totalling CDollars 180m which were suffered by its pension fund in Castor's
collapse. National said yesterday, however, that all investment decisions
relating to Castor were taken by senior Chrysler employees. It said that
Chrysler also made direct corporate investments in Castor.
Besides the claims against Coopers, the bankruptcy trustee is also suing Mr
Stoltzenberg and Castor's other directors. According to the trustee, the
directors should be held liable for a dividend declared less than a year
before Castor collapsed.
All the actions are being vigorously defended. Coopers has submitted a list
of 492 'particulars' on which it wants further information. But the courts
have so far allowed it to proceed with only a fraction of the queries.
