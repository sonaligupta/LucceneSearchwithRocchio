FT  26 MAY 93 / British buyers eye Independent stake


BRITISH investors have expressed interest in taking a stake in Newspaper
Publishing, owner of The Independent and the Independent on Sunday.
Preliminary contacts have been made with Newspaper Publishing's merchant
bank SG Warburg and with Schroders, advisers to the company's principal
shareholders El Pais of Spain and La Repubblica of Italy. A UK investor's
stake of 10 per cent to 20 per cent would counterbalance the Spanish and
Italian stakes of 18.3 per cent each.
