FT  25 AUG 92 / Observer: Big spender


Even if your name is CINVen and you are one of Europe's biggest venture
capitalists, isn't it a bit complacent to imagine every potential client
knows CINVen's address, let alone its phone number?
Backed by three of the biggest pension funds  - British Coal, British Rail
and Barclays Bank  - CINVen certainly has deep pockets. It invests over
Pounds 250m a year in unquoted investments and has not been shy to publicise
its prowess. 'If you'd like to know more, we'd like to know you', trill the
CINVen adverts.
Perhaps, the advert is some sort of customer initiative test to weed out the
non-starters.
