FT  15 NOV 93 / One last chance to get it right: Philip Stephens on the
balancing act facing Clarke


   By PHILIP STEPHENS


THE FATE of Mr John Major's government hangs on whether the Conservative
party at Westminster regains the self-discipline and political will to
sustain it in office.
If the party has put behind it the reflex of rebellion ingrained by its
battles over the Maastricht treaty, there is a fair chance that the prime
minister can rebuild his shattered authority. If it has not, his government
is doomed.
Mr Kenneth Clarke's first Budget on November 30 will provide the test. No
one at Westminster is quite sure how bitter will be the medicine needed to
reduce the government's Pounds 50bn borrowing requirement.
But neither is anyone in doubt that the combination of further tax increases
and a squeeze on public spending, which has been tougher than most have
realised, has the potential to trigger another collective nervous breakdown.
Mr Clarke and Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury, have
already framed a detailed programme to sell the package to their own back
benches.
The chancellor, the leader in the cabinet of One-nation Toryism, will
explain to the right of his party that he has been as tough as politically
possible on public spending.
In the same breath he will be reassuring the centre-left that less money for
schools, hospitals and social security benefits does not herald an all-out
assault on the welfare state.
Mr Portillo, the holder of the Thatcherite torch, will take the tougher task
of persuading the disgruntled and dispossessed on the Tory right that a
further round of tax increases is not a fundamental betrayal of the 1980s.
Neither will have an enviable task. The latest FT survey of pre-Budget
opinion on the Conservative back benches shows the party as divided as ever
as to how Mr Clarke should climb out of his Pounds 50bn-a-year public
borrowing hole.
The majority is resigned to a further round of tax increases even before
those announced by Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, have started to
bite.
But a sizeable minority believes Mr Clarke should do nothing more to
undermine the Conservatives' already threadbare claim to be the party of tax
reduction.
By contrast, more than two-thirds think there is scope for a further
tightening of the public spending screw. They may not be quite so convinced
once the detailed impact of the cuts already imposed emerge. But, unfair or
otherwise, there is a widespread view on the Tory right that Mr Clarke sees
higher taxes as the easier option.
There are deep concerns too about the impact of the imposition of value
added tax on domestic fuel. The implicit warning to the Treasury is that it
must rethink its resistance to broadening the scope of the compensation
package to those above the income-support levels.
The serious concern that economic recovery has yet to become entrenched is
reflected also in the call by fully four-fifths for the chancellor to ease
the pain of a tighter fiscal policy with cuts in interest rates.
Only 7 per cent think he should regard control of inflation as the top
priority.
On one level the divisions over tax increases may simply reflect the
uncertainty even within the Treasury over how far taxes can be raised to
reduce borrowing without halting a patchy and still-hesitant economic
recovery.
Senior ministers admit there is no unanimity in the cabinet either on the
scope for tax increases in addition to the Pounds 10bn-a-year package put in
place by Mr Lamont. Most ministers believe Mr Clarke must do something more.
But whether that should be a 'symbolic' Pounds 1bn or so or a 'real' Pounds
5bn or so is potentially as divisive an issue in the cabinet as it is on the
backbenches.
There are glimmers of re-assurance for Mr Clarke in the results of the
survey. Although he has not been tested in his five short months at the
Treasury, more than two-thirds are prepared to say he has done a good or
excellent job.
More significantly there are signs that carefully targeted and less readily
understood tax increases - through freezing or reducing income tax
allowances and through further reform of mortgage interest relief - could
win support.
Mr Clarke, we must assume, will produce a clever package with higher taxes
for all cloaked in the guise of the tax reform to which every new chancellor
aspires.
The Conservative party will then have to decide whether it wants to continue
in government.
