FT  24 AUG 92 / Some time to wait before the Bundesbank budges


   By EDWARD BALLS


BUNDESBANK-watching is an increasingly popular pastime among Europe's
politicians as well as financial markets operators. Only when the Bundesbank
council decides to ease German monetary policy will the beads of sweat on
the brows of finance ministers in London and France start to dry up.
History, and the stubborn growth of German money supply, suggest they may
have a long wait.
The Bundesbank's task is to secure stable prices in Germany alone. In spite
of being the de facto central bank of Europe, it is not required to care a
jot about inflation or economic growth in any other country. So, short of
leaving the ERM or agreeing to an upward revaluation of the D-Mark which
might encourage the Bundesbank to ease earlier, other European countries
have little choice but to wait.
The Bundesbank will not budge until it is convinced that its monetary policy
has been tight enough for long enough to put German inflation firmly on a
downward path. Recent signs have been promising. The annual inflation rate
in west Germany dropped to 3.3 per cent in July from 4.3 per cent in June,
its lowest level since May last year. Wholesale prices fell by 0.9 per cent
over the year to July as the falling dollar cut German import prices.
Yet, like any other prudent central bank, the Bundesbank will take some
convincing. Mr Jeremy Hale, an economist at Goldman Sachs, the investment
bank, has measured the average length of time that central banks in the US,
Japan and Germany wait before easing policy once inflation has peaked. The
chart tracks the official discount rate in the US, Japan and Germany in the
months before and after their most recent inflation-rate peak.
The US and Japan provide a test for Mr Hale's admittedly rather tentative
results. Concerns about the build-up of debt in the US encouraged the
Federal Reserve to move unusually quickly this cycle compared to the
previous four. The first cut in the discount rate came in January 1990,
three months after the peak in inflation, compared to an average lag of
eight months since 1970. But the Bank of Japan hit its average historic lag
spot on. Inflation peaked in January last year and the first rate cut came
six months later.
The German evidence is more difficult to interpret. Strictly, the average
historic lag since 1970 is only two months, suggesting that, as the consumer
inflation rate peaked in March of this year, the discount rate should have
fallen in May. In fact, it rose in June. But this historic average is
distorted by the period of global fixed exchange rates when the Bundesbank's
autonomy was compromised and the discount rate was cut in April 1969, 15
months before German inflation peaked.
The lag between the inflation peak and the fall in the discount rate was 10
months in both 1972 and again in 1981-82, slightly longer than in the US and
Japan, as the Bundesbank's reputation would suggest. If history repeats
itself for the third time then the first cut in the German discount rate
will not occur until January, as the chart implies.
Do not bet on it. Bundesbank-watching, like economics, is an art and not a
science. While history can provide clues, every cycle is different. And
unification has made this German cycle especially different. The
Bundesbank's credibility has since been dented twice, first when its
recommendations for the terms of monetary unification were ignored and then
by the subsequent acceleration in inflation.
To repair the damage and reassert its anti-inflationary zeal, the bank's
council agreed an austere target for broad money growth this year of 3 1/2
per cent to 5 1/2 per cent. But continued rapid growth of state subsidised
bank lending to east Germany means that it is still overshooting this target
range. M3 grew at an annual rate of 8.6 per cent between the fourth quarter
of last year and last July and is not expected to re-enter the target range
this year.
So history is likely to under-estimate the time that the Bundesbank will
wait before cutting interest rates. It may even raise them first. Europe's
finance ministers may still be sweating in the spring.
