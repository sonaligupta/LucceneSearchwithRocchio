FT  27 JUN 92 / Industrial output tumbles in Japan


   By STEVEN BUTLER

JAPAN'S industrial output plummeted in May by 8.7 per cent compared to a
year ago, the most severe year-on-year decline since 1975, the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry said yesterday.
However, it was insufficient to encourage any drop in the high levels of
inventories, which rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.4 per cent during the
month compared to April. Inventories were 5.5 per cent higher than a year
ago.
Shipments declined by 1.4 per cent, month-to-month, indicating that final
demand is still declining.
The rise in inventories suggests industrial output will decline further in
the months ahead as manufacturers cut production to clear the overhang of
unsold goods. Yesterday's figures also bring into question the timing of an
expected recovery, which the government expects to come in the autumn.
Sales at large-scale stores in Japan rose by 0.3 per cent in May, compared
to a year ago, Miti said. However, the increases were concentrated in
supermarkets, while department store sales declined by 0.7 per cent. The
declines reflected consumer preferences for cheaper goods.
