FT  11 JAN 92 / Finance & The Family: Oil prices fall on Iraqi news


Oil prices fell to their lowest level since the end of the Gulf War this
week as traders reacted to the prospect of the return of Iraqi oil to the
market. The price of North Sea Brent crude for February delivery closed down
by over a dollar on Wednesday to Dollars 17.05 a barrel from the previous
day and was down further at Dollars 16.85 yesterday afternoon.
Wednesday's fall was triggered off by talks between an Iraqi delegation and
UN officials in Vienna on the possibility of partly lifting the UN embargo
on Iraqi oil sales. Prices have declined by almost Dollars 6 a barrel in the
past six weeks.
