FT  01 JUL 92 / Boost to savings ratio


   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff


CONSUMERS' reluctance to increase spending and tough financial pressures on
many companies were highlighted in figures released yesterday pointing to
subdued growth this year.
The Central Statistical Office said the savings ratio - personal savings as
a percentage of disposable income - rose to its highest for nearly 10 years.
It was 11.5 per cent in the first quarter from 10 per cent in the last three
months of last year.
The bigger-than-expected increase highlighted how many consumers appear
unwilling to increase their spending.
Company spending in the first quarter exceeded receipts by Pounds 4bn, up
from a Pounds 1.1bn deficit in the fourth quarter of last year and Pounds
2bn in the previous three months. Company profits fell 6 per cent between
the fourth and first quarters.
The seasonally adjusted figures covering personal and company finances may
have been distorted by uncertainty ahead of the general election. Many
consumers are thought to have reined back spending plans, leading to weak
sales growth.
Especially in the light of the lack of an evident upturn since the general
election, the statistics underline the generally weak state of demand in the
early part of this year.
One potentially bright spot for the economy in the first quarter was that
real personal disposable income increased by 1 per cent compared with the
fourth quarter of last year. That followed a 0.3 per cent decline between
1990 and 1991.
However, much of the increase reflected a 1.9 per cent increase in wages and
salaries between the fourth and first quarters, a development thought to be
due mainly to early payment of bonuses ahead of the election. Further
increases in income of this size are therefore not expected later in the
year.
