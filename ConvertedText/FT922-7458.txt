FT  19 MAY 92 / Moscow may keep nuclear missiles on Kazakh soil


   By JOHN LLOYD


MR Nursultan Nazarbayev, the president of Kazakhstan, yesterday foreshadowed
the shape of new defence alignments in the former Soviet Union when he said
Russian nuclear missiles may in future be allowed to be based on Kazakh
soil.
Mr Nazarbayev, who was leaving Moscow for an official visit to the US after
talks on Sunday with Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, said the
missiles at present in Kazakhstan would be returned to Russia, and that
future stationing of part of the Russian nuclear armoury would depend on the
two states' reaching a 'mutually advantageous' agreement.
Kazakhstan, with Ukraine and Belarus, are expected to sign a protocol to the
Start treaty on nuclear weapons soon, allowing the implementation of a
treaty stalled for some months by disagreements between the four nuclear
states of the former USSR.
Agreement has now been reached between them, and between them and the US,
that all four should become signatories to Start - after which the three
non-Russian states would accede to the Nuclear non-Proliferation Treaty, and
return all tactical and strategic weapons on their territory.
Mr Nazarbayev emphasised that the decision to send all nuclear missiles to
Russia and to negotiate an agreement on basing Russian missiles in
Kazakhstan in future was possible because of the signing last Friday in
Tashkent of a collective security agreement between six of the 11 members of
the Commonwealth of Independent States.
The signatories to the agreement are Armenia, Kazakhstan, Russia,
Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.
Of these, the last three are poor Central Asian states who cannot afford to
support their own military, and who have CIS forces on their territory paid
for by Russia. Mr Yeltsin said last week that Russia could come to an
arrangement with other states to base units of the Russian army on them by
agreement.
Kazakhstan, evenly balanced between a Slav and Kazakh population, has under
President Nazarbayev pursued a largely pro-Russian policy, and has proposed
itself as a 'bridge' between East and West.
