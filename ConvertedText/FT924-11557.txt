FT  24 OCT 92 / Briefcase, Q&A: Who took my interest?


I RECENTLY paid a cheque to a fund management company for establishing my
account with them. The cheque was cleared from my account on March 8, but
did not appear in my cash account with the company until the following day,
thereby losing me one day's interest. They have advised me that their
bankers did not receive clearance for the cheque until the March 9.
Given that the large clearing banks use a common computerised system for
clearing cheques, how can it be that funds taken out of from my bank account
one day do not appear in the receiving parties bank account as the same day?
Who is benefiting from the use of my money for the one day without paying
interest on it?
This is a common occurrence: indeed longer intervals may occur. The benefit
would appear to accrue to one or other of the clearing banks.
You may wish to pursue your query with the Banking Ombudsman.
