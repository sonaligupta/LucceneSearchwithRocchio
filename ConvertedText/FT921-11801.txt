FT  30 JAN 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Carat gives Sundays
the stick


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


As the UK's 'quality' Sunday newspapers have spawned new sections and
increased in girth, advertisers have become more interested in who actually
reads what.
Ray Kelly, chief executive of Carat UK, the media space buyers, was
increasingly frustrated at traditional industry-sponsored research which
treats each title as a single entity.
So Carat carried out its own Quality Sundays Sections Readership Research -
Quaser - with some surprising results. It covered the Sunday Times,
Observer, Sunday Telegraph and Independent on Sunday.
The research found, for instance, that the Sunday Times business section was
one of the least read sections of the paper, despite charging premium
advertising rates.
Giving the main news section a base of 100, the business pages scored only
57 and only 52 on the index of up-market AB readers. On the same index, the
review section scored 90 and 96 respectively even though advertising rates
are lower. Low female interest in business could be one of the reasons for
the difference. On value per Pounds 1 for AB adult readers of the Sunday
Times, the business section scored 54 compared with 346 for the review
section.
The business section was well read by those who did read it - 111 on the
index - but there were four times the number of 'exposures per Pounds 1' in
the review.
Other findings were that the amount of time spent reading the four Sunday
papers was very similar at around 113 minutes and that AB readers spent less
time than the average.
The research was carried out by re-interviewing more than 1,000 regular
readers identified by a large general consumer research panel. Data on
lifestyle and product use is now being added.
