FT  05 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading


   By JOEL KIBAZO


FOOTSIE futures surrendered Monday's gains in a volatile session as the
recent gloom in the markets caused by economic worries returned, writes Joel
Kibazo.
A firm opening at 2,455, after the previous day's strong close, appeared to
indicate another good session. However, within half-an-hour a retreat set in
and was indicative of the volatility and decline that was to come.
Having dipped to 2,445, September was then squeezed forward, reaching 2,458
by 10am. The renewed strength proved short-lived, however, as uncertainty
and worries about the economic outlook gained the upper hand, sending not
only the contract into retreat but also pulling the underlying cash market
down. A decline in gilts also affected sentiment.
Several attempts at a rally were noted in the September future, but the
contract eventually ended at 2,418, down 28 from its previous close and
around 3 points below its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 12.
Turnover came to 7,834 lots.
Traded options remained dull, with a majority of the day's total volume of
20,495 contracts seen in the index options. The FT-SE 100 option had 9,052
lots transacted.
