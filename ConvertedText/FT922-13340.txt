FT  11 APR 92 / Alleged faking of Ford parts is probed


   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent


TRADING standards officers in London are investigating a suspected
international fraud involving counterfeit Ford parts.
Parts suspected of being fake were seized by police when they raided
premises in Haringey, north London. Trading standards officers said no
charges had yet been made but a prosecution was being considered.
Officers confirmed that consignments of allegedly fake Ford spare parts had
been confiscated, and added that there was believed to be a South American
connection in the source of the parts.
Ford said it had experienced difficulties for many years from the
importation of counterfeit parts. It added that the main source of such
parts had appeared to be Taiwan, but the supply now appeared to be coming
from South America and Turkey.
Ford said yesterday: 'We lose considerable revenues from the loss of sales
of genuine parts. But what is equally worrying is that the customer can
suffer. They may be fitting parts that are copies in every respect except in
quality - they could be lethal and dangerous.'
