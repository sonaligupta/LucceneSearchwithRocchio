FT  15 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Obsession not shared


   From Mr OSMAN STREATER


Sir, Some of us - but not, it would seem, your leader writer ('Follow the
Fed', April 14) - think a monument should be erected to the unknown
journalist who recently gave us the phrase 'inflation nutter' to describe
the obsessive tendencies of people such as the governor of the Bank of
England.
The phrase also applies to the former unlamented chancellor of the exchequer
who opined that unemployment, bankruptcy and repossession of homes was 'a
price well worth paying' for reduced inflation. Perhaps it even applies to
the prime minister, who may soon be discovering what the British electorate
thinks of his view that 'if it isn't hurting, it isn't working'.
So you should not be surprised to find that your statement that 'the latest
step towards greater central bank autonomy is welcome' is not universally
shared, even among people who have managed to hang on to house, home and
job. Instead, how about compulsory resignation for unelected governors, to
be enforced the moment interest rates are increased by a total of one
percentage point during their term of office?
