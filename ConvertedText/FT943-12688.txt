FT  23 JUL 94 / UK Company News: TT makes agreed Pounds 16m offer for Dale
Electric


   By DAVID WIGHTON


Dale Electric, the North Yorkshire-based generator manufacturer, has agreed
a Pounds 16m bid from TT Group, the acquisitive conglomerate.
TT's offer of 70 1/4 p a share cash is recommended by the directors headed
by Mr Iain Dale, chairman, who have accepted the terms for their 3.5 per
cent holding. TT already owns a further 3.5 per cent.
Mr Dale expressed sadness that the company was giving up its independence
after 59 years but said it needed to be part of a bigger group to survive in
increasingly competitive international markets. 'In the last 10 years we
have not been able to offer consistency of profits and the best way forward
for the business is from within another group.'
The company was founded in 1935 by Mr Dale's father Leonard, a milkman and
cinema projectionist. After enjoying strong growth in the 1970s, Dale was
hit hard by the recession in the early 1980s and more recently by the
downturn in aviation markets and unfavourable exchange rates.
Dale's results for the year to May 1, released yesterday, showed sales down
from Pounds 60.1m to Pounds 48m, of which half were exports, and a pre-tax
loss of Pounds 4.15m (Pounds 1.34m profits). This was struck after Pounds
3.44m of exceptional charges and Pounds 926,000 of interest.
The company returned to an operating profit in the second half but is not
paying a final dividend.
Mr John Newman, joint chief executive of TT, said he was happy that Dale's
finances had been 'cleaned up' and was confident that returns could be
improved rapidly. He could not comment on prospects for the group's 700
employees but said: 'Our intention is to grow the business.'
In 1987 Dale fought off a bid worth 136p a share from Sunleigh and the
shares reached a high of 147p in 1989. They closed at 61p, up 1p, yesterday
before the bid was announced.
As an alternative to cash TT is offering one of its shares for every five
Dale, valuing each at 70.2p.
