FT  12 NOV 93 / Market curb on auditors proposed


   By ANDREW JACK


AUDITORS WILL be restricted from underwriting or marketing new issues under
draft ethical guidelines issued by the accountancy profession yesterday.
Any accountancy firm which acts as the sponsor on an issue for a client will
be excluded from underwriting or marketing the issue.
The guidelines - which supplement the accountancy ethical rules on corporate
finance - have been redrafted following changes to London Stock Exchange
regulations earlier this year.
The exchange's revised 'Yellow Book' of regulations on listing allowed
accountancy firms for the first time to act as a sponsor on an issue of
shares or securities.
The draft guidelines were circulated by the Chartered Accountants Joint
Ethics Committee.
The ban prevents auditors as sponsors from pricing shares or securities,
although it says pricing does not include advice to a client on the content
of an offer document.
The new rules say public documents and circulars should prominently show the
name of the marketing firm and 'make abundantly clear' the roles undertaken
by different advisers.
Mr Jock Worsley, chairman of the committee, said it was vital that a
sponsoring auditor should not be involved in marketing or underwriting,
although he welcomed the general principle that auditors should be allowed
to become sponsors.
Consultation on guidelines is open until December 15.
