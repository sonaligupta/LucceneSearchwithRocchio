FT  30 JUN 93 / French Privatisation: French to cut public health spending


   By DAVID BUCHAN


THE FRENCH government yesterday unveiled a plan to cut FFr32.2bn (Pounds
3.84bn) in public health spending over the next 18 months in a move to curb
the recession-swollen budget deficit, writes David Buchan.
The health cuts, which will mainly take effect next year, take the form of
lower reimbursement by the state social security system of the costs of
visits to doctors and of prescribed medicines, as well as an increase to
FFr55 (Pounds 6.56) of the flat fee for treatment in a hospital.
However, the chronically ill will not pay the higher charges.
France spends more on health - around FFr10,000 per inhabitant in 1990  -
than any other European country, with about 75 per cent of this being funded
by the state, either from the budget or from contributions levied on
workers' salaries.
