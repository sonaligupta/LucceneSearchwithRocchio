FT  22 OCT 94 / Privatisation flop prompts rethink

Japan's finance minister yesterday confirmed that he is to review the
government's method of pricing shares in companies to be privatised.
Mr Masayoshi Takemura's announcement comes in response to the unpopularity
of the latest privatisation issue, Japan Tobacco, a cigarette making
monopoly. 'We must seriously look into the situation to see if there is any
problem about the way we have taken in the past,' he said.
The government has been left with 280,000 unsold shares out of the 666,666
it wanted to sell, a shortfall theoretically worth Y287.6bn (Pounds 1.8bn)
at the Y1.438m per share offer price.
Nearly 70 per cent of the small investors who were allotted the right to buy
shares forfeited their allocations because they felt they were overpriced.
This has brought to a head the growing criticism from Japanese as well as
foreign securities houses over the finance ministry's unique method of
setting prices for public share issues.
The ministry chooses the mid-price achieved in a pre-offer auction of one
third of the shares to be issued. Typically, institutional investors and
rich individuals tender for shares in this pre-offer auction, so that the
mid-price risks being higher than the valuation the remaining two-thirds of
investors would place on the company. The system was introduced at the end
of the 1980s to prevent frauds, in which companies about to be listed would
hand out cheap shares to powerful friends.
One alternative to the new rules, proposed by US and European business
lobbies in Japan, is to adopt the 'book-building' system used for most
international issues, in which financial advisers use their discretion to
choose a price after sounding out the main potential investors.
