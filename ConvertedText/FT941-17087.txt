FT  06 JAN 94 / People: Scottish Heritable Trust


Roger Shute, chief executive of mini-conglomerate Scottish Heritable Trust,
has become chairman as well, succeeding Edward Denison, who retired at the
end of the year.
The company took the opportunity to congratulate Denison on his role in
pursuing a successful claim in the US courts for damages of Dollars 8.5m,
which was announced last week, against KPMG Peat Marwick regarding the
acquisition of a 50 per cent stake in Rangaire Corporation in 1988.
Dealing in the shares of SHT, which has borrowings of around Pounds 24m, has
been suspended since mid-November. SHT directors have another meeting with
the syndicate of banks supporting the company next Tuesday to discuss a
proposed refinancing package.
