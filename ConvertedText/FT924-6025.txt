FT  24 NOV 92 / India's trade deficit doubles


   By SHIRAZ SIDHVA

INDIA'S trade deficit more than doubled during the first six months of the
current financial year to Dollars 26.22bn (Pounds 17.3bn) compared with
Dollars 10.21bn for the same period of last year.
This indicates that India's performance on the balance of payments, worries
over which led to an economic reform package earlier this year, is not
proceeding on course, say economists.
The trade deficit for the six months to September has worsened despite a
5.37 per cent increase in exports in dollar terms, to Dollars 85.48bn
against Dollars 81.13bn. However, uncertainty over rupee-rouble trade after
the collapse of the Soviet Union continues to exert a negative influence,
according to a government economist.
The increase in the trade deficit has been fuelled by a higher-than-expected
22.3 per cent growth in imports to Dollars 111.70bn from Dollars 91.34bn.
'This growth in imports appears unduly large because of massive import
compression by the government last year,' said a Commerce Ministry official.
'But there is still cause for concern as the Indian industrial sector
continues in a recessionary phase.'
