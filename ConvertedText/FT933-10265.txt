FT  05 AUG 93 / Advisers 'exploit' the newly redundant


   By BETHAN HUTTON


PEOPLE made redundant are being exploited by financial advisers who ignore
their clients' needs, the Consumers' Association says.
A report in this month's Which? magazine found that nearly two thirds of
financial advisers gave newly redundant people bad advice. The advice was
also strongly biased towards commission-paying investment options.
The association sent researchers posing as redundant employees with a Pounds
25,000 lump sum to a total of 30 banks, building societies, insurance
companies and independent financial advisers.
The researchers made it clear they did not have another job in prospect and
had no other source of income. The best advice, according to Which?, would
have been to put the money in a savings account until their situation was
clearer.
Instead, almost two thirds of the advisers recommended putting some, or all,
of the lump sum into an investment bond which would pay substantial
commission to the adviser but which would involve some risk to the investor.
This included high charges and possible losses if it were cashed in early.
Ms Jean Eaglesham, head of money policy at the Consumers' Association, said:
'Commission talks, and consumers are the casualties. Clearly the current
regulatory mechanisms aren't doing the job they were set up to do.'
Nearly a third of the advisers failed to disclose whether they were
independent or tied to one insurance company.
Mr John Pinniger of Fimbra, the self-regulating body for financial advisers,
said: 'We recognise that quality is not consistent across the industry -
that is something that has to be dealt with and we are doing that.'
