FT  16 JAN 92 / Inflation falls further in France


   By WILLIAM DAWKINS


   PARIS


FRANCE'S inflation rate fell to a provisional 3.1 per cent last year, the
first time in two decades it has sunk below the rate in western Germany, the
main benchmark used by official economic planners, writes William Dawkins in
Paris.
The figure compares with 3.4 per cent in 1990 and this year's 2.8 per cent
target, and puts France well below the 4.5 per cent average for its nine
main trade partners. The German inflation rate rose by 4.2 per cent last
year.
The figures, released by the Insee state statistics institute, are the
latest vindication of the long-standing anti-inflation policy supported by
both government and opposition for almost 10 years.
