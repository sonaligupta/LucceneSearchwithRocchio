FT  16 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Canada endorses plan to strengthen drug
patents


   By BERNARD SIMON


   TORONTO


CANADA has endorsed the Uruguay Round proposals to strengthen patent
protection for brand-name pharmaceuticals, in the face of strong protests
from the powerful generic drug industry.
The endorsement, if the Uruguay Round is successful, would effectively end
compulsory licensing, which has been a thorn in the side of the world
multinational drug industry for more than two decades.
A 1969 law required pharmaceutical makers to license products to generic
companies long before their patents expired.
Brand-name suppliers were given greater patent protection in 1987, but the
law still allows generic companies to copy a drug within seven to 10 years
of its launch.
Acceptance of the proposals would extend patent protection to 20 years.
