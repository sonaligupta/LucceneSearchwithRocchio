FT  29 JUL 92 / French shun holiday reform


   By ALICE RAWSTHORN

Four out of ten French companies will close for the summer holiday for part
of July or August this year, according to official figures, writes Alice
Rawsthorn in Paris.
Despite government's efforts to encourage industry to spread holidays more
evenly throughout the year, thereby lessening the financial disruption
caused by long stoppages over the summer, the French are still attached to
their traditional long summer breaks.
August is still the most popular holiday period with 50.4 per cent of
workerstaking time off. July comes second with 28.6 per cent.
