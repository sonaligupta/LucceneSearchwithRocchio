FT  30 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading


   By JEFFREY BROWN


Stock index futures moved higher for the fourth trading day in a row, but
activity remained low and most traders closed their books early in order to
concentrate on the Budget, writes Jeffrey Brown.
The FT-SE 100 December contract was 3,068 at the end of pit trading, up 13
points for a four-day advance of 44 points. The premium to the cash market
was seven points, or two points over fair value.
But dealers said the market was again mostly on hold, waiting for the chance
to get to grips with the contents of the chancellor's Budget Box. Contract
numbers again failed to breach 10,000.
There was a certain amount of 'respectable' buying during the morning
session, but by the early afternoon the local, independent traders had the
market largely to themselves and little real business was transacted.
On balance, the Budget statement was thought by futures traders to be
suitably neutral, and in late screen-based trading the December contract
edged up to 3,072.
Option trading improved to 25,991 lots from Monday's 17,732, with call and
put volume evenly matched. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE business accounted for just
under 15,000 contracts.
TSB was the most active stock option, turning over 1,050 lots, followed by
Hanson (924 lots) and HSBC (881).
