FT  10 JAN 92 / Attempt to heal rift over unit trust sales


   By NORMA COHEN


THE UNIT Trust Association, in an effort to stem a wave of resignations by
its life assurance company members, has agreed to add a statement of the
life companies' views to a controversial submission to the Securities and
Investments Board.
Last month the UTA angered life company members by describing the industry's
sales abuses in unusually harsh terms and criticising the life assurance
sales commission structure which, it said, urged unsuitable products on an
unsophisticated public.
Prudential, Legal & General, Guardian Royal Exchange, Scottish Provident and
Allied Dunbar have resigned from the UTA in protest, cutting the trade
group's revenues by 10 per cent.
The UTA yesterday met 31 of its 50 life assurance company members which also
have unit trust interests.
The submission to the SIB argues that the sale of unit trusts should be
'de-polarised'. Currently unit trusts and life products are 'polarised' -
sales agents must either sell only the products of one supplier or sell the
products of all suppliers.
The companies which resigned said they had done so over the criticism of the
industry, not the stance on de-polarisation, though the life assurance
industry opposes de-polarisation for unit trusts.
