FT  20 APR 94 / People: Patrick McTighe


Patrick McTighe, chairman of CI Group, the Wolverhampton-based engineering
company, died on Sunday after a recent illness.
McTighe, who was 65, had been a board member for four years at CI Group,
which makes industrial steel flooring and other products, and chairman for
the past two and a half years.
He was known mainly for his long association with Davy, the engineering
contractor. After joining Herbert Morris in 1970, he became a director of
Davy Corporation in 1977, and later chairman and chief executive of Davy
Engineering Industries before becoming deputy chief executive and, in 1990,
chief executive of Davy Corporation. A year later, he was instrumental in
the takeover of Davy by Trafalgar House.
CI Group says McTighe had been very active in planning its strategic
direction. In recent months the board had been seeking a new non-executive
director as chairman elect, and a further announcement will be made soon.
