FT  13 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Azlan for market with Pounds 50m valuation


   By ALAN CANE


AZLAN GROUP, a distributor of advanced computer networking products, is to
obtain a full Stock Exchange listing through a placing and intermediaries
offer which values the company at Pounds 50.2m.
Some 9.6m shares are being offered or placed at a price of 230p a share. The
offer has been fully underwritten by SG Warburg Securities. There will be
21.8m shares in issue following the offer.
Some Pounds 6m, net of expenses, is being raised to increase the company's
range of products, improve its market share and help expand its business in
continental Europe.
Under the offer, 3.04m shares are being issued by the company and 6.6m
shares are being sold by existing shareholders. Some 6.5m shares are being
placed with institutional investors and 3.1m are being offered to
intermediaries on behalf of their clients.
Azlan reported earnings per share of 8.4p for the year ended March 31,
giving a p/e ratio at the offer price of 27.4. The forecast final net
dividend for the year to March 31 1994 is 2p, giving a notional dividend of
3p. Gross dividend yield at the offer price would be 1.6 per cent.
Azlan has chosen to take the high added value approach to the distribution
of products in one of the fastest growing areas of the computer marketplace.
The company distributes only leading edge, high technology, products at an
early stage in their implementation when dealers have most need of Azlan's
expertise in selling the products to customers.
When products become commodities and gross profit margins start to decline,
Azlan's declared policy is to move into new areas which offer better
profitability. It is a risky strategy, demanding intense concentration, but
offers better margins than conventional electronics distribution. Last year
the company made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 2.9m on sales of Pounds 41m.
