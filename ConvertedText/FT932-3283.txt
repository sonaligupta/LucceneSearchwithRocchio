FT  15 JUN 93 / Letter: UK is obviously correct in its chosen economic
course


   From Dr ROSALIND M ALTMANN


Sir, What a shame] Why has the UK government wasted a golden opportunity to
lead Europe forward to a better future? Why do we continue to portray our
exit from the exchange rate mechanism as a 'humiliation'?
Even the ex-chancellor can only whinge and criticise instead of standing up,
as he should have done last September, and proclaiming that the British move
was the only rational economic policy to follow when Europe was marching
from the hoped-for policies of disinflation over the cliff edge into
depression. Britain's exit should have been portrayed as a move
demonstrating strength and vision which the rest of Europe (Germany
excepted) needed to follow.
There is nothing wrong with allowing currency devaluation if it is the only
means by which interest rates can fall to a level more compatible with
economic stability. The UK has not abandoned stability policy by easing on
the monetary side when a tightening of fiscal policy and a global
disinflationary environment have so diluted the inflationary risks. On the
contrary, the UK is pursuing the only obvious course for most European
economies to follow at this juncture.
The only problem has been the manner in which policies were implemented; the
moves themselves are so sensible. What a shame we are not able to be proud
of them. At least we can take comfort that the UK will fare better by having
pursued the right policies in the wrong way rather than the wrong policies
altogether. Poor Europe]
