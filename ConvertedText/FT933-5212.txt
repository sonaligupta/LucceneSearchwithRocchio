FT  04 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Prowting acquires Galliford for Pounds
22.6m


   By CATHERINE MILTON


PROWTING, the lossmaking housebuilder, is buying Galliford Homes Group, a
south of England housebuilder and former Sears offshoot, from its management
for Pounds 22.6m.
The consideration is being satisfied by the issue of 14.4m shares and Pounds
5.3m cash. Of the shares, 9.95m have been firmly placed and 2.68m placed
subject to a 1-for-5 open offer at 120p a share.
Mr Terry Roydon, managing director, said the deal would expand Prowting's
equity by 23 per cent but immediately increase its output from 350 to 900
housing units. The company believed the acquisition would enhance earnings
per share. He said: 'We are combining a long land bank company with
relatively low annual sales with a company that has high sales relative to
its land bank. This will make a company with good volume and a reasonable
land bank and not one which is out of proportion as ours is at the moment.
Make the land bank sweat.'
Galliford reported operating losses in the year to January 1993 of Pounds
430,000 (profits Pounds 924,000) before provisions on its land bank of
Pounds 6.39m (Pounds 9.9m). Turnover was Pounds 48.9m (Pounds 52.2m).
In 1992-93 provisions against land holdings pushed Prowting into pre-tax
losses for the second consecutive year. After a Pounds 4.93m (Pounds 22.4m)
provision, pre-tax losses were Pounds 4.87m (Pounds 17.7m) for the year to
February 28, on turnover down by 4 per cent from Pounds 36.4m to Pounds 35m.
Galliford was founded in 1964 and acquired by Sears in 1975. In 1990 Sears
withdrew from housebuilding and the business was then run on the basis of
using up its land bank.
In April this year, management, supported by funds advised by Schroder
Ventures Advisers, Sumit Equity Ventures and North of England Ventures,
bought the business.
Galliford's development sites are all in southern England.
