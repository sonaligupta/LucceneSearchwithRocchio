FT  27 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sugar price down further
despite lower Cuban crop


   By DAVID BLACKWELL


FINAL CONFIRMATION that Cuba's sugar crop will be only 4.2m tonnes compared
with last year's 7m tonnes did not prevent a further decline in New York raw
sugar prices, writes David Blackwell.
In late trading yesterday the July contract was down 0.63 at 11.15 cents a
lb - well off the high of 13.26 on May 17.
The fall came in spite of Monday night's announcement from Cubazucar, which
put the outcome of the troubled harvest well below all recent trade
estimates. Czarnikow, the London trade house, last week estimated Cuban
production at 5.5m tonnes, a figure matched this week by ED & F. Man, also
of London.
Production in Cuba, the world's biggest exporter, has been hit by bad
weather and problems with the country's crumbling infrastructure.
Falls in production in Cuba, Thailand and India have led to early
predictions of a world surplus this year being changed to predictions of a
deficit, averaging around 2m tonnes below consumption.
This has been enough to drive prices sharply higher after a flat period
between last September and February, when nearby New York traded between 8
and 9 cents a lb.
However, the market has eased back recently as physical demand for sugar has
not been evident, partly because of the high prices.
