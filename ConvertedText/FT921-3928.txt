FT  12 MAR 92 / Treasury and Civil Service Committee Report: Regulation
attracts strongest criticism


   By ROBERT PESTON


THE strongest criticism of the committee's report into the collapse of BCCI
is aimed at the system for regulating international banks.
The committee made six main recommendations:
The Bank of England should lobby its fellow central banks for an amendment
to the 1983 Basle Concordat - an agreement between bank regulators on the
supervision of international banks - to ensure that every international bank
is subject to proper supervision by a single regulator. This regulator would
monitor all of a bank's operations.
An international body should set and monitor the supervisory standards
imposed by bank regulators. The committee suggested that the Basle Committee
on Banking Regulations, which consists of regulators from the group of 10
leading industrial countries and Switzerland, should play this role.
The Bank of England should receive annual reports on the accounting
practices and management controls employed in the UK-based branches of an
international bank whose domicile is overseas. These reports would be
prepared by the branches' reporting accountants.
A bank's accountants should be obliged to report to the Bank of England if
it uncovers anything unusual at the bank. Under the 1987 Banking Act,
accountants are permitted to ignore duties of client confidentiality and
share their concerns with the Bank - but they have no duty to do so.
The Bank of England should use its own inspectors more frequently to carry
out 'on site' investigations of a bank, rather than relying exclusively on
information from the bank's accountants.
The Bank should also launch a study into whether it is sensible for
international banks to operate through branches in the UK, rather than
through incorporated subsidiaries.
