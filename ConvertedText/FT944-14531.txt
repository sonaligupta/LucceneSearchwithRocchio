FT  22 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Unsubstantiated failures


   From Mr BARRY WITCHER


Sir, Michael Hammer, ('No need for excuses', October 5) writing of
re-engineering failure rates, says '. . . we find it breathtaking when the
70 per cent figure is cited as an authoritative statement of
re-engineering's successes and failures because . . . one of us made it up'.
Something similar happened for total quality management (TQM); there, the
authoritative failure figure is 80 per cent. It was cited widely at the
recent annual conference of the British Academy of Management, yet research
conducted at Durham and University of Manchester Institute of Science and
Technology clearly showed that the vast majority of TQM is still in place,
and that less than 5 per cent of organisations seem totally dissatisfied.
For example, in a large survey of organisations in Scotland last year, fewer
than 1 per cent of organisations with TQM expressed total dissatisfaction.
Perhaps for new things it is always 'open season'.
