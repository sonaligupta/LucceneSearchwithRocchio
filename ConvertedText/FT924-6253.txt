FT  23 NOV 92 / Survey of World Commercial Vehicles (4): New plant opened in
France - Profile of Scania


   By KEVIN DONE


IN THE MIDST of declining heavy truck markets across Europe, Scania, the
specialist Swedish heavy truck maker, has added to its capacity with the
opening of a new truck assembly plant at Angers in western France.
Scania has long enjoyed the leading position as the most profitable truck
maker in Europe, but its financial performance is coming under pressure as
it adds capacity at a time of shrinking demand.
The Swedish truck and bus maker is a subsidiary of Saab-Scania, the
automotive and aerospace group, which in turn forms the main wholly-owned
operating unit of Investor, the Swedish investment group controlled by the
Wallenberg family.
When European truck sales were booming in the late 1980s Scania was unable
to keep up with demand and was forced to sacrifice market share. It embarked
on the Angers project at the peak of the market, however, and it now faces
the burden of carrying the excess capacity through the duration of the
present recession.
Last year the group succeeded in compensating for the lower demand in
western Europe with increased sales in other markets, in particular in the
Middle East and in the Far East, but this has proved more difficult in 1992.
In the first half of this year sales of Scania trucks and buses fell by 10
per cent to 14,961 from 16,643 in the corresponding period a year earlier.
Turnover has declined by 7 per cent to SKr8.38bn. It captured a 10.4 per
cent share of the European heavy truck market (above 15 tonnes) last year, a
fall from 11.2 per cent a year earlier. Scania's truck production operations
are located in Europe - in Sweden, in the Netherlands and in France - and in
South America, where it began to build trucks, buses and engines in Brazil
in the mid-1950s and in Argentina in 1976.
It has a leading position among European truck makers in the Middle East and
Far East, where its trucks are assembled under licence in South Korea by
Asia Motors, a subsidiary of the Kia group.
The main blank on the Scania map is North America, where the Swedish truck
maker has failed to follow its European rivals Mercedes-Benz, Volvo and
Renault into the US industry. Unlike these three groups, which have all
taken over established US truck producers - and have all suffered heavy
losses - Scania tried to go it alone, but with little success.
Since 1985 Scania has exported to the US a limited volume of trucks for sale
in the north-eastern states of the US, but it was forced to announce in the
summer that it was discontinuing production for the US from the end of this
year. It blamed its withdrawal on the lack of profitability in the US heavy
truck market and 'the unlikelihood of a return to profitability in the
foreseeable future'.
Scania's well-established global presence in markets outside north America
has been an important source of strength in the face of the volatility of
demand in individual markets. In 1989 its five biggest truck markets were
Brazil with 4,099 vehicles sold, the UK, 3,507, France, 2,942, Sweden, 2,656
and Italy, 2,506.
In the space of two years the UK, Sweden and Italy had dropped out of the
top five to be replaced in 1991 by Germany - with 4,011 vehicles Scania's
biggest market - Iran and the Netherlands.
Iran, where Scania sold no trucks in 1990, emerged as its fourth largest
market worldwide last year with the sale of 2,300 vehicles. Scania's sales
in Germany, where it is the leading heavy truck importer, with a market
share of around 6 per cent, have more than doubled in three years from 1,813
in 1989 to 4,011 last year. In the same period its sales have more than
halved in the UK, however, falling to only 1,263 last year from 3,507 in
1989.
Helped by a surge in the construction sector in South Korea Scania sales
there more than trebled last year to 1,798 from 537 a year earlier.
This year the Iran and Korea markets have declined, and Scania truck sales
are also falling in line with the markets in Germany and in Brazil.
Scania has been unable to make up for these falls, although it has made
gains in Argentina, and in several smaller markets such as Morocco, Tunisia
and Syria. It has returned to Morocco this year after an absence of 30 years
with the assembly of trucks and buses by Soriac, a privately-owned, local
group. It is aiming at a sales volume in Morocco of around 250 vehicles a
year.
The access to overseas markets has not been sufficient during the recession
in Europe to maintain production levels at Scania's Swedish and Dutch
plants, and the group has announced measures to cut its workforce in the two
countries by 875 by early next year. It had a workforce of 22,000 at the
beginning of 1992 with 6,500 at its main Sodertalje plant in Sweden, and
9,000 outside Sweden.
To bring output into line with falling sales production is being stopped for
a total of 9 days from September to the end of the year at the Dutch plants,
while four production days will be lost at the Swedish plants around the end
of the year.
The decline in Europe means that production at the new Angers plant, where
Scania has initially invested close to FFr400m (Pounds 49m) will develop
much more slowly than originally planned. The workforce presently totals
around 200 including 120 hourly-paid workers. With output running at 5
trucks a day the Angers plant is scheduled to produce 600 trucks by the end
of this year. At full capacity of 30 trucks a day the workforce is expected
to rise to 400-500.
Scania has developed plans to establish an engine plant at Angers as well as
to further boost truck production capacity at the site, but investment in
further expansion will require first a significant recovery in the European
heavy truck market.
The group is aiming to have a production capacity for 50,000 vehicles a year
by the mid-1990s. Last year total deliveries of trucks and buses increased
by 5 per cent to 33,100, including 3,980 buses, the second best year in the
group's history.
