FT  26 MAY 93 / Argyll ahead 14% to Pounds 417m for year


   By PAUL TAYLOR


ARGYLL GROUP, the UK's third largest food retailer which runs the Safeway
and Lo-Cost/Presto chains, yesterday reported a 14 per cent gain in
full-year profits.
Pre-tax profits increased to Pounds 417.3m in the 53 weeks to April 3,
compared with Pounds 364.5m in the previous 52 weeks on sales which grew 10
per cent to Pounds 5.54bn.
After adjusting for the extra week and disposal of the group's drinks retail
businesses in mid-1991, sales increased 9 per cent.
Argyll's results, described by Sir Alistair Grant, chairman, as 'very
respectable in a tough market,' follow similar profit gains at Sainsbury,
and are better than Tesco's results.
Group operating profits climbed 18 per cent to Pounds 387m as the operating
margin widened to 7.4 per cent from 6.9 per cent. They were underpinned by a
22 per cent increase in operating profits to Pounds 336.2m from the Safeway
stores on sales that grew 13.3 per cent to Pounds 4.42bn. Safeway's
operating margin increased from 7.5 per cent to 8.1 per cent.
New Safeway stores and less store closures contributed 8.8 percentage points
of the sales gain, with 2.3 percentage points coming from existing stores
and the balance from the additional trading week. Inflation was 2 per cent.
Group capital expenditure totalled Pounds 611m, including Pounds 393m spent
on opening 26 new Safeway stores and acquiring four others making a total of
345. The group ended the year with net debt of Pounds 42m and gearing of 3
per cent, compared with net cash of Pounds 199m a year earlier.
This year 24 Safeway stores are due to open at an average cost of Pounds
16.5m each.
Overall capital spending is projected to increase to a peak of Pounds 650m.
Interest income declined to Pounds 28.2m (from Pounds 33.5m) and included
Pounds 2.6m in dividends from its shareholdings in two continental European
retailers, Ahold and Casino.
Earnings per share grew by 12 per cent to 27.1p (from 24.2p) and a final
dividend of 7.35p (against 6.55p) will lift the total payout 12 per cent to
10.9p (from 9.75p).
Commenting on current trading, Sir Alistair said Safeway sales in the first
six weeks were 14 per cent ahead of last year, including existing store
sales growth of 2 per cent.
