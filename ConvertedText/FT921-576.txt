FT  28 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Recession cuts UDO to Pounds 2.7m


   By ANDREW BOLGER


UDO HOLDINGS, which supplies drawing office equipment and reprographic
services, said there had been no let-up in recessionary trading conditions
when it reported a drop in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 4.15m to
Pounds 2.71m.
Turnover fell from Pounds 28.3m to Pounds 25m in the six months to January
31. The company said 50 jobs had been shed out of 1,000 in the last year and
working capital restricted, but no measures could offset the fall in
turnover completely.
Although earnings per share fell to 6.23p (9.41p), the interim dividend is
raised by 20 per cent to 1.94p (1.62p). The company cited the strength of
its balance sheet to justify this payment, cash balances having increased by
Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 14.9m.
UDO said it had introduced new products and claimed its position had also
been improved by a reorganisation of management, recent acquisitions and the
effects of recession on competitors.
Mr Mike Wright, chairman, said: 'The measures taken to mitigate the effect
of the recession will undoubtedly benefit the group when business improves.
There is however no current indication of any such improvement, with many
companies unable or unwilling to invest for the future.
'The vast majority of overhead saving have already been made and the major
problem still facing the group remains the level of turnover.'
