FT  15 DEC 94 / Sarajevo may see UN aid


   By LAURA SILBER

UN relief workers yesterday were making a push to get aid through to
Sarajevo, after Bosnian Serb leaders appeared to soften their position,
writes Laura Silber in Belgrade. A spokesman said two convoys, carrying 239
tonnes of food, were heading for Sarajevo, and 13 more were planned for
other parts of Bosnia.
Recent Bosnian Serb restrictions have virtually halted the delivery of
humanitarian aid. But relief workers were hoping to take advantage after
Serbs allowed the passage of a convoy to the Bosnian capital. Their efforts
coincided with signals from Bosnian Serb leaders that they will rejoin the
peace process if the international mediators negotiate directly with them
rather than with President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia.
