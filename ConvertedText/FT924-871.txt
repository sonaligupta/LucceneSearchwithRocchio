FT  22 DEC 92 / International Company News: UK pensions restructured


   By BARRY RILEY


   LONDON


COURTAULDS Textiles is to restructure its pension scheme to reduce a surplus
which has reached 55 per cent of liabilities on prudent assumptions.
The clothing manufacturer, demerged from the Courtaulds fibres and chemicals
group in 1990, will increase benefits and withdraw Pounds 32m (Dollars 48m)
in cash for the company's benefit, although more than Pounds 12m of this
will go in tax. These moves will cost Pounds 38m.
