FT  28 JAN 94 / AA fees 'liable to 3% tax'


The 3 per cent tax on insurance premiums announced in the November Budget
will apply to many other types of commercial contract, including membership
fees at the AA, RAC and similar organisations, according to City solicitors
Lovell White Durrant.
It said that, because of the way the finance bill was drafted, the new tax
could apply to payments for guarantees, indemnities and performance bonds
issued by banks.
