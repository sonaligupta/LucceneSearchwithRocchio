France's defence spending plan for 1995-2000 was presented to the French
government and President Francois Mitterrand yesterday, envisaging
expenditure of FFr650bn (Pounds 76bn) over the six years with a review in
1997. The main international projects include the FLA European transport
aircraft, to be developed by an eight-member consortium, a Franco-German
armoured car, due to be delivered from 2002, a project with Britain and
Italy to build a Horizon frigate, to be delivered in the same year, and the
nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, Charles de Gaulle, due for delivery in
1999.
The NH-90 European transport helicopter, being developed by France, Germany,
Italy and the Netherlands, will see its costs reduced by between 20 and 30
per cent from the planned level of FFr9bn.
