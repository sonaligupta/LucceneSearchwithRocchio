FT  27 JAN 94 / International Company News: Time Warner plans new stores


   By RICHARD TOMKINS


The retail arm of Time Warner Entertainment, the US media group, plans to
open stores this year in London, Glasgow and Berlin, writes Richard Tomkins.
The move is unusual for US retailers, most of which are reluctant to extend
beyond their domestic market.
Warner Bros Worldwide Retail said the stores were among 50 it planned to
open in 1994 to add to the 60 operating in the US.
The stores sell gifts and clothing featuring characters from Warner Bros
films, such as Batman and Bugs Bunny.
The 28,000 sq ft London store will be the biggest in the chain after the
group's flagship store in Manhattan.
