FT  02 NOV 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market report


   By REUTER


ALUMINIUM prices dropped to fresh eight-year lows on the London Metal
Exchange yesterday, tumbling to Dollars 1,037 a tonne at one stage before a
short-covering rally took the three-month price back up to Dollars 1,045.2,
down Dollars 22 a tonne from Friday's close. Aluminium's collapse depressed
sentiment in other metals, particularly COPPER, which sagged back towards
six-year lows. However, traders said there was some underlying support near
Dollars 1,620 a tonne. NICKEL was lower from the outset and prices subsided
below Dollars 4,600. Silver's fall (see story above) dragged down precious
metals and GOLD tested support at Dollars 362 before closing in London
Dollars 6.05 a troy ounce down at Dollars 362.75. PLATINUM fell by Dollars
5.15 to Dollars 369.35 an ounce. 'Having failed on the upside last week,
silver gave us the excuse to take it (gold) down to test lower levels,' said
one dealer. Another said platinum 'has not acted independently for weeks; it
is just mirroring movements in gold and silver'. COCOA prices clawed back
some of their early losses, with the March contract closing at Pounds 964,
down Pounds 6, in routine trading, after dipping to Pounds 955 following a
slump in New York.
