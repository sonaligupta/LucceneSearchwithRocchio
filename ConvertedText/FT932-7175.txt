FT  25 MAY 93 / International Company News: OMV reduces losses as energy
business recovers

OMV, the Austrian integrated oil and chemicals group, reported a smaller
operating loss in the first quarter due to recovery in its energy
businesses. However, losses worsened in its chemicals and plastics
operations.
The first-quarter loss was Sch135m (Dollars 11.8m) compared with a loss of
Sch247m in the same period of 1992. Turnover was up 7 per cent at
Sch20.33bn, but the group cautioned that the growth was due to the inclusion
of new activities in its accounts.
OMV said the period was marked by better conditions towards the end of the
quarter than at the beginning of the year.
The chemical division tumbled to a loss of Sch100m, after breaking even in
the comparable period, because of 'extremely difficult' conditions in
industrial chemicals, such as melamine. Agro-chemicals, on the other hand,
made a profit, as volume sales of fertilisers were high towards the end of
the quarter.
A small increase in prices for plastics towards the end of the quarter was
not enough to prevent a widened loss of Sch490m in this division.
The exploration and production division raised its profit from Sch50m to
Sch180m due to an increase in crude oil prices and the sale of the Canadian
subsidiary. One quarter of the CDollars 180m proceeds was taken into the
accounts.
The gas division's operating profit jumped 40 per cent to Sch450m on
turnover up only 2.9 per cent to Sch2.12bn. The group said the profitability
of importing, transporting and storing gas improved.
The loss in the refining division narrowed to Sch90m from Sch150m, mainly
due to cost cutting. Margins and monomer prices remained inadequate.
The marketing division performed well, but continued high capital investment
in retail outlets caused a loss of Sch90m, down from a loss of Sch120m.
