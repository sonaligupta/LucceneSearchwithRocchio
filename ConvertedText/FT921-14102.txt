FT  17 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading


   By JOEL KIBAZO


TRADING in Footsie futures was volatile, with the March contract traded
around its fair value premium for most of the session, writes Joel Kibazo.
March opened at a 42-point premium to the underlying cash market and
continued to advance until it was knocked back by a bout of mid-morning
institutional selling.
News of the cut in the mortgage interest rates by the UK's largest lenders
triggered another bout of buying which was further encouraged by
better-than-feared UK employment figures.
However, a poor US bond market coupled with a weak opening on Wall Street
caused March to retreat, in spite of a modest rally towards the close. March
closed at 2,568, down 11 on the day and some 4 points above its estimated
fair value premium to cash of 23. Turnover reached 7,266.
In traded options, volume of 41,447 was again high though lower than
Wednesday's 51,352 contracts. The Footsie 100 option traded 5,955 contracts.
Hanson was the busiest stock option, trading a day's total of 4,630
contracts with the May 220 calls the busiest series. Cable and Wireless was
the second busiest stock option with County NatWest reported to have carried
out a 'short synthetic'.
