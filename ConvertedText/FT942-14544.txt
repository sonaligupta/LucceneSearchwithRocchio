FT  20 APR 94 / Police swoop on suspected funding sources for IRA

British and Irish police yesterday carried out a series of raids as part of
an unprecedented co-ordinated security crackdown on suspected funding of the
IRA.
Scotland Yard said a substantial quantity of drugs, cash, stolen property,
and fraudulent financial instruments - thought to be used for money
laundering - were recovered from 41 addresses in the Irish Republic,
Northern Ireland, north-west England, London and Surrey. There were eight
arrests. The raids involved 1,000 officers drawn from police on both sides
of the Irish border, including the Royal Ulster Constabulary's
anti-racketeering squad, the Metropolitan Police's anti-terrorist squad, and
three UK regional squads.
They are part of a continuing joint operation code-named Operation Madronna.
The raids followed a year-long covert investigation, also involving the
British security service MI5, into suspected sourcing of millions of pounds
of funding for the IRA's operations.
A joint police statement last night described the raids as the first time
the RUC's anti-racketeering squad had mounted an operation involving so many
forces. 'It is an indication of the common objective that all police forces
have of defeating terrorism,' it said.
However, security officials will need to examine the evidence thrown up by
the seized documents before gauging what damage, if any, they have caused
the IRA.
Irish police said three people had been arrested in the Dublin area and that
'a large amount of documentation' had been seized. But the Irish government
appeared to play down the political significance of the raids by describing
them as part of an campaign against 'criminal racketeering'.
