FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Crockfords gambling profits rise 16%


   By DAVID BLACKWELL


Crockfords, the casino company that was reversed into TV-am last summer,
lifted profits from its gambling business by 16 per cent in 1993. Operating
profits from the continuing gambling side rose from Pounds 19.8m to Pounds
23m on gaming turnover up from Pounds 44.4m to Pounds 51.3m.
At the pre-tax level profits for the year to end-December were Pounds 23.2m
against Pounds 38m in 1992, with the 1992 figure including Pounds 15.7m of
operating profits from TV-am, which stopped broadcasting on December 31
1992.
Crockfords opened London's first legal casino in Curzon Street in 1961. Last
August the company reversed into TV-am, which had lost its licence and was
planning a voluntary liquidation.
Mr Garry Nesbitt, chairman, said the group was firmly established at the
upper end of the London gaming market.
While the number of casinos in London was unchanged at 21, the total gaming
income was 34 per cent ahead at Pounds 304m. 'I believe that a significant
proportion of this increase may have been from the higher value players for
whom we cater,' Mr Nesbitt said.
Basic earnings per share were 16.18p (24.05p).
A final dividend of 2.5p is proposed for the first four months of the year,
equivalent to 7.5p for the full year.
Mr Nesbitt said the strategy was to develop the existing club, on which
Pounds 700,000 was spent last year, and to look out for other London
casinos. It would also be seeking acquisitions or start-up opportunities 'in
Europe and other overseas areas where gaming is well regulated'.
COMMENT
Profits at Crockfords depend on a small number of big hitters - the
prospectus said that over three years ten exceptional players had accounted
for 50 per cent. Clearly the company needs at least one more casino to
diversify its risks. But it is highly cash generative and ungeared, so
should be able to move quickly once an opportunity arises. Given the same
level of business this year earnings could reach more than 16.5p. A dividend
of 8p would represent a yield of more than 6.5 per cent - worth the gamble.
