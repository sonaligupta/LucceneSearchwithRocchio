FT  23 JUL 94 / Easing of radio rules is sought


The Radio Authority has asked the government to simplify ownership rules for
commercial radio stations.
Limits on how many stations a company can own are determined by a points
system. A national commercial station is worth 25 points, while a local
station is worth three points.
No group can own more than 15 per cent of the points or more than 20
licences, more than six London and large metropolitan stations, or two FM
stations in any area.
The authority wants to preserve the 15 per cent rule, but believes most of
the others are no longer necessary.
