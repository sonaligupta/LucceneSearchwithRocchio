FT  27 JAN 94 / Treasury blamed for roads setback


   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent


Treasury constraints have delayed road-building contracts worth Pounds 1.6bn
and prevented the creation of nearly 50,000 jobs, the British Road
Federation said yesterday.
Between April 1991 and March 1994 work should have started on 128 schemes
worth nearly Pounds 3bn yet so far only 74 projects worth Pounds 1.4bn have
begun. Mr Richard Diment, federation director, said: 'This is bad news for
the construction industry, for towns waiting for a bypass and for business
stuck with a Pounds 15bn bill for congestion.'
The Department of Transport denied that a shortage of finance lay behind the
delays and said road schemes which were announced still depended on
obtaining planning consent. In the current year starts were planned on 41
schemes.
Design and build contracts, which are planned to account for a third of new
road construction schemes over the next three years, are to be extended to
principal road maintenance contracts, Mr John MacGregor, transport
secretary, said yesterday.
He is extending the arrangement to seven schemes with a combined estimated
value of Pounds 23m in England.
