FT  20 APR 94 / Business Air Travel (18): Airports of the world - An outpost
on an heroic scale / Munich


   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES


Munich's shiny new steel and aluminium Franz-Josef Strauss airport is, for
the most part, a successful attempt at user-friendliness. It might have come
off even better had the Bavarians not been tempted to build what is
essentially a medium-sized regional service point on such an heroic scale.
The place has clearly been built with long-term growth (and the prosperity
of the German metal-working industry) in mind. However, disproportionate
walking distances are partly compensated for by an unclaustrophobic
atmosphere and a liberal sprinkling of cafes and restaurants.
A full range of services is amply staffed by people with a tendency to brisk
efficiency, further contributing to a more relaxed feel than is common in
such places.
The principal drawback is the airport's position well away from the city,
which makes travelling to and fro something of a trial. It can be costly,
too, for those who elect to avoid the cheap 45-minute S-Bahn train ride
across the dead-flat Bavarian heathlands to the city centre.
High spot of the journey is the airport visitors' viewing point: a perfect
cone of spoil from the airport construction work. The S-Bahn journey is
comfortable enough, but over-punctuated with stops at every hamlet along the
way.
The taxi ride, officially 30 minutes, but often longer because of the
Germans' love of traffic jams, costs a whacking DM90.
Experienced hands on one-day trips prefer to hire a small car for up to
DM60, but this is not especially advised for occasional visitors unfamiliar
with Munich's whirligig traffic guidance systems.
