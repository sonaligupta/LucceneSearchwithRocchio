FT  14 APR 94 / Observer: Secure future


What price respectability? Secure Trust, the financial services group, is
keen to move upmarket and is reviving the name of Arbuthnot Latham & Co,
which used to be one of the pillars of the Accepting Houses Committee.
Founded in 1833, Arbuthnot Latham was the breeding ground for chairmen of
National Westminster Bank before it fell on hard times. Secure Trust picked
up not only the right to the name but also some furniture, photographs and
other nicknacks for Pounds 50,000.
Not bad, given the added bonus that the new name comes near to the top of
the alphabet.
