FT  21 NOV 92 / Daily Mirror journalists picket


   By JIMMY BURNS


DAILY MIRROR journalists protested outside the London headquarters of Mirror
Group Newspapers yesterday to try to bring about the reinstatement of 100
sacked colleagues, Jimmy Burns writes.
The journalists will picket MGN's headquarters today in an attempt to
disrupt production of two Sunday newspapers, the Sunday Mirror and The
People,
More than 100 freelance journalists, many of whom have worked on various MGN
titles for years, have been locked out of the building since Monday.
Yesterday they were joined by other trade unionists and readers in a
demonstration that demanded the dismissal of Mr David Montgomery, MGN's new
chief executive, and the reinstatement of all those sacked over the past
week.
The sackings form part of a reorganisation of MGN by the group's new chief
executive Mr David Montgomery.
According to MGN executives, several casual shifts were being worked a week
with unnecessary costs for the company.
Mr Montgomery said yesterday that 'no nook or cranny' of the MGN business
would be untouched in a reorganisation aimed at achieving a 'tight and
efficient operation.'
The reorganisation has the backing of a group of banks that effectively own
54 per cent of MGN, held as collateral for loans made to the Maxwell
interests now in administration.
Mr Trevor Davies, father of the National Union of Journalists chapel (office
branch), said the absence of casuals had disrupted production and
advertising at the Daily Mirror this week.
The MGN chapel is balloting its members on strike action today with a result
expected to be announced next week.
