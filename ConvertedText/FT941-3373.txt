FT  16 MAR 94 / International Company News: Fannie Mae in scheme for
low-income borrowers

   NEW YORK


The Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) yesterday launched a
series of initiatives to provide mortgage financing to help low-income
families in the US buy their own homes. The plan involves boosting the
amount of 'targeted lending' to special groups by more than Dollars 140bn to
Dollars 1,000bn before the end of the decade.
Fannie Mae's scheme comprises a series of programmes aimed at providing more
information to potential homebuyers, making it easier for low-income or
disadvantaged families to win approval for a mortgage loan, and ending
racial discrimination in the lending process.
By the end of the decade, Fannie Mae hopes to have provided a total of
Dollars 1,000bn in financing to mortgage providers, and to have helped 10m
families buy homes.
The company is the largest provider of mortgages in the US. It does not sell
mortgages directly to homebuyers, but invests in mortgages sold by mortgage
companies, savings and loan institutions and banks.
Fannie Mae will direct the programmes at low and moderate-income, and
minority families, new immigrants to the US, people living in inner-city
areas or neglected communities, and people with special housing needs.
The programmes Fannie Mae plans to introduce include: multilingual
television, radio and print advertising; support for the government's
campaign against racial discrimination in mortgage financing; second and
third reviews of rejected mortgage applications and counselling to improve
families' chances of securing mortgages; new financing tools specially
designed to help the elderly, rural families, native Americans and other
groups to secure mortgages for new homes or renovations; and investment in
technology to speed up the mortgage approval process.
