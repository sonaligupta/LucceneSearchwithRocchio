FT  15 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Sunsail plans Pounds 20m flotation -
Placing with institutions intended to raise Pounds 3m of new money


   By DAVID BLACKWELL


Sunsail International, the sailing holidays operator with more than 650
yachts worldwide, is planning to come to the market early in the new year.
The group, which aims to be valued on flotation at about Pounds 20m, intends
to make a placing with institutions to raise more than Pounds 3m of new
money.
Pre-tax profits in the year to October 1993 were Pounds 1.3m, on turnover of
Pounds 21m. Turnover to October 31 this year is expected to top Pounds 24m;
net debt stood at about Pounds 3.5m.
The business has grown from a sailing school near Portsmouth, which was
acquired in 1979 by managing director Mr Christopher Gordon, a sailing
enthusiast since childhood.
It now operates in 18 countries from 19 bases and nine hotel sailing clubs.
About 80,000 people sail with the company annually, with repeat bookings on
about 50 per cent of business.
In 1980, Mr Gordon made his first foray abroad through the purchase of
Island Sailing, with 40 boats in Greece, from Guinness with a three-year
interest free loan of Pounds 300,000.
The company expanded by acquisition, including one in Turkey. In 1987 it
more than doubled in size to an operator of 250 yachts by buying the Yacht
Cruising Association. A joint venture in the US took Sunsail into the
Caribbean.
In 1991 Mr Gordon sold the company for shares worth up to Pounds 8m in
Airbreak, the USM-quoted tour operator.
But Airbreak collapsed the following year, in part blaming unexpected
problems following the deal with Sunsail. Mr Gordon and his wife Sally,
marketing director, turned to Mercury Asset Management and put together a
Pounds 1.4m management buy-out to retrieve the company.
'We think we may be the only tour operator that actually survived a parent
company going bust,' said Mr Gordon.
Mercury remains the majority shareholder, with Mr Gordon, his wife and
management holding the rest. Mercury is expected to sell most of its stake;
management is planning to sell some shares, but to retain about 30 per cent.
Flotilla sailing accounts for only about 20 per cent of turnover. Sunsail's
activities include independent yacht chartering and shore-based watersports
holidays, as well as sailing tuition.
