FT  16 DEC 94 / Philippine-IMF talks hitch


   By JOSE GALANG

Philippine debt negotiators yesterday haggled with a visiting International
Monetary Fund review team over the fine points of what appeared to be a
'tacit' agreement on increased monetary expansion ceilings in the country's
economic programme. The Philippine government wants to aim for a higher
overall economic growth target without being hemmed in by tight liquidity
and inflation ceilings. Mr Gabriel Singson, governor of the Bangko Sentral
ng Pilipinas, the country's central monetary authority, said the visiting
IMF team had agreed there will be some relaxation on monetary aggregates for
1995. However, Philippine panel member Mr Roberto de Ocampo, finance
secretary, earlier told journalists the IMF had asked for 'more evidence'
from government negotiators to support the request for new ceilings.
