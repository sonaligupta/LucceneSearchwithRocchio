FT  28 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Bullough records 18% decline to Pounds
5.89m - Annual dividend expected to be maintained despite gloomy economic
prospects


   By ROLAND RUDD


THE PROLONGED and deepening recession in the UK and France was behind an 18
per cent fall in interim profits at Bullough, the office products and
refrigeration group.
For the six months to April 30, pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 7.18m to
Pounds 5.89m on sales of Pounds 132.7m, down from Pounds 141.5m.
The interim dividend is maintained at 1.75p. Earnings per share fell from 4p
to 3.12p.
Mr Derrick Battle, chairman, warned that 'because of the lack of any
discernible economic upturn' profits for the full year would be lower than
the Pounds 20.8m achieved last time. The group still intends to maintain the
dividend for the year at 6.05p.
Operating profits from office products fell from Pounds 4.27m to Pounds
1.55m. Atal in France was reduced to near break-even as the company has
still to work through planned redundancies with local authorities.
Mr Battle said he remained pessimistic about a UK re-covery in office
furniture.
Last year's demand for new fridges, prompted by health and safety
regulations covering the temperature of food in distribution and display,
was not sustained. Refrigeration's profits fell from Pounds 2.12m to Pounds
975,000.
The division's costs were up in anticipation of a better second half,
although both full-year sales and profits are likely to remain below last
year's.
The lower cost base of BFN Storefitters and Beanstalk enabled Store Fitting
to reduce its loss from Pounds 1.82m to Pounds 66,000.
Operating profits at the remaining divisions were: heating Pounds 2.1m
(Pounds 2m); electrical Pounds 466,000 (Pounds 748,000) and engineering
Pounds 1.28m (Pounds 858,000).
Capital expenditure of Pounds 5.3m was mainly responsible for an increase in
net borrowings from Pounds 7.8m to Pounds 8.8m.
COMMENT
Bullough has long been seen as a safe recovery stock. Given that the
long-awaited recovery looks further away than ever, the key question is how
will the group fare without an upturn in the economy? While office products
shows no signs of an improvement, electrical and engineering businesses
should continue to make impressive advances in sales and profits. The latter
is particularly sweet for the company since it was advised by some
commentators to sell the division. The worst appears over in store fitting,
and although refrigeration had a disappointing first half it is expected to
do better in the second. With full-year pre-tax profits of Pounds 17.5m,
giving earnings per share of 9.3p, the shares - down 21p to 114p - are on a
prospective multiple of 12.2. They still look fairly priced though,
irrespective of whether an economic recovery takes place.
