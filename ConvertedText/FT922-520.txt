FT  27 JUN 92 / Letter: Principles to guide public sector pay


   From Mr GERARD HOWE


Sir, Here we go again on public sector pay ('Playing catch-up with the
private sector fat cats', June 23).
The principles that should guide public sector pay, and which are surely
clear enough by now, are:
Rewards should allow a continuing competent service;
External comparisons - of the whole package - are inevitable. You can debate
the choices and the methodology but not the need;
Take account of the risks and potential among your chosen comparisons as
well as today's figures;
Reward achievement, but balance risk and reward - for both employer and
employee - looking at performance standards, job security, ease of filling
vacancies, proportion of variable pay, etc;
Only then can you make a proper judgement about the overall level and the
make-up of the constituents.
Nobody would suggest that this was easy, but openness about the reasoning is
essential. It may sometimes suggest that the real problems have little to do
with pay.
One thing is clear. If a substantial adjustment really is justified, then
delay makes things worse.
