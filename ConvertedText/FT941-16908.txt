FT  07 JAN 94 / Air holiday price rise welcomed


The Civil Aviation Authority yesterday welcomed a 9 per cent rise in the
average price of holidays last year, saying it suggested tour companies were
operating at realistic margins.
The average price of an air holiday rose to Pounds 346 in the year to the
end of September 1993, compared with Pounds 318 a year before. The number of
holidays sold in the same period increased 10 per cent to 14m.
