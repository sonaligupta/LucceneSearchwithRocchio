FT  27 MAR 92 / International Company News: Salomon chief gives blessing to
Maughan


   By PATRICK HARVERSON


   NEW YORK


MR Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor who took over as interim
chairman of Salomon after the Wall Street securities house became engulfed
in scandal last year, wants Mr Deryck Maughan to be named chief executive of
the group's broking operation, Salomon Brothers, when the government's
investigation of the scandal is completed this year.
Mr Maughan, currently Salomon Brothers' chief operating officer, was tipped
to take over the helm of the big broking firm after being appointed by Mr
Buffett last August to clear up the mess created by the bond trading
scandal.
Mr Maughan has instigated a number of fundamental reforms. Although the
changes have created some unrest within the company, and led to departures,
Mr Maughan remains generally well-liked by staff and has the full confidence
of Mr Buffett and the board.
There is so far no indication who will succeed Mr Buffett as head of the
entire Salomon group, which includes Salomon Brothers and the Phibro oil
trading and refining operation. Mr Buffett, who says he will step down as
chairman when the federal inquiry is over, is believed to favour a new chief
executive independent of both Salomon Brothers and Phibro.
In a separate development, Salomon has rejected demands from former chairman
Mr John Gutfreund and former vice-chairman Mr Thomas Strauss - who both
resigned their positions last year because of the bond trading scandal - for
more than Dollars 16m in bonuses and severance pay.
Mr Gutfreund and Mr Strauss have claimed they are owed about Dollars 7m and
Dollars 9m respectively in the form of severance pay, a special bonus pool
and annual bonuses earned for work completed before their departure. They
are also claiming Dollars 6.8m and Dollars 6m respectively in stock and
stock options.
