FT  30 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Huntingdon dips 12% in first quarter


   By ROLAND RUDD


Huntingdon International Holdings, life sciences and engineering services
group, reported a 12 per cent fall in pre-tax profits in its first quarter
for the year to September.
Mr David Morgan, business development manager, said the decline, from Pounds
4.07m to Pounds 3.58m, was the result of the continuing recession in the US,
where over 67 per cent of sales were generated. Turnover increased from
Pounds 28.4m to Pounds 31m.
However, Mr Morgan said the new US regulations would help it penetrate the
environmental services market.
The recently agreed acquisition of Travers Morgan had cost the group Pounds
6m in cash and a further Pounds 6m in shares. Mr Morgan said the
reorganisation of the company, specialising in road, bridge and tunnel
design, would be completed after the group's second quarter.
Earnings per share were 0.029p (0.033p) and per ADR were 26.7 cents (30.6
cents).
