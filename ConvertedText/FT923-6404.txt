FT  25 AUG 92 / Water regulator to tighten rules


   By NEIL BUCKLEY


MR IAN BYATT, director-general of Ofwat, the water industry regulator,
yesterday acted to ensure that water companies could not use funds from
their core businesses to subsidise other activities.
Using new powers available to him after publication of the Competition and
Services (Utilities) Act in July, Mr Byatt published proposed amendments to
water companies' operating licences designed to give him greater control
over their non-regulated businesses.
Water companies have diversified into many fields since they were privatised
in 1989.
The proposals include a ban on cross-subsidies between water companies and
their associated companies, or between their water businesses and any other
businesses.
Water companies would also be prohibited from allowing an associated company
to supply any service that the core company might supply as part of its
regulated water business, on more or less favourable terms than those
available from the core company.
