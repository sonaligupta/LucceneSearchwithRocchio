FT  30 JUN 93 / D-Mark not in danger


The D-Mark's role as 'the anchor' of the European exchange rate mechanism is
not in danger, in spite of its recent weakness, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the
Bundesbank president, said last night. Occupying the central role 'does not
mean that our interest rates must necessarily be the lowest' in the ERM, he
said.
