FT  11 APR 94 / Observer: Mersey mouth


Only a poet of Roger McGough's calibre could appear on the BBC's Desert
Island Discs and admit that music didn't mean much to him. The Liverpudlian,
who has probably done as much for poetry as the Beatles have done for music,
said that all his records sounded 'much the same'. But if he had to take
one, it would be a record of foghorns on the River Mersey. If he played it
loud enough, it might attract a passing ship and lead to his rescue.
