FT  09 JAN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Sterling slides against D-Mark


STERLING continued to slide against the D-Mark on the foreign exchange
markets yesterday, falling close to its 'floor' within the European exchange
rate mechanism.
From a close of DM2.8450 on Tuesday, the UK currency had fallen to DM2.8350
by late morning, dragged down by the weakness of the dollar and just on the
limit of its permitted divergence range within the ERM.
From this level sterling proved unable to sustain a rally and remained weak
through the afternoon session.
This weakness occurred as the US currency was firm or rising, demonstrating
that the fortunes of sterling are not tied to the dollar.
Earlier this week, analysts were ascribing sterling's weakness within the
ERM to the fall of the dollar, since any decline in the value of the US
currency was likely to benefit the D-Mark. However, yesterday's sterling
decline indicated that it can fall while the dollar is gaining against other
European currencies.
At 4pm in London, the closing time used by the Bank of England to calculate
sterling's position within the ERM, the UK currency stood at DM2.8395, the
lowest close against the D-Mark since sterling joined the system.
By 5pm sterling had fallen further still and was pinned back at the day's
low of DM2.8350 when trading ceased in London, a full 2 pfennigs down from
Monday's opening level of DM2.8550.
The dollar was firm against the yen and D-Mark yesterday in spite of a brief
scare in mid-morning after early reports that US President George Bush had
been taken ill.
Following a late rally in London on Tuesday, the dollar continued firmer
overnight in the Far East. At the close in Tokyo, the US currency stood at
DM1.5095, from a close in New York of DM1.5065, and at Y124.40, from
Y123.90.
Having failed to breach the psychologically important DM1.50 level, the
dollar was pushed higher against the German currency.
Comments by Mr Nicholas Brady, US treasury secretary, on the progress of
trade talks with the Japanese government contained only a passing reference
to the dollar/yen exchange rate. This disappointed many dealers following
speculation that the two governments would agree to a controlled devaluation
of the dollar against the yen as a means of moderating the US trade deficit
with Japan.
This more positive tone continued into European trading until the first
reports of President Bush's illness were received. Amid an atmosphere of
deep uncertainty about the health of Mr Bush, the US currency fell back to
DM1.5060 and Y123.95.
However, later reports confirmed that Mr Bush was suffering from only a mild
illness and the dollar recovered ground to close at DM1.5150 and Y124.84 in
London, but off the day's highs of DM1.5195 and Y125.40. It ended in New
York at DM1.5072 and Y124.23.
