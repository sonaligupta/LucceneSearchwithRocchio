FT  29 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): FT moves to end dispute over RSI


   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff


THE FINANCIAL Times management yesterday moved to end a dispute with the
National Union of Journalists over journalists suffering from repetitive
strain injury (RSI).
The newspaper's chapel (union branch) has voted for strike action over
management plans to consider the compulsory retirement on ill-health grounds
of nine long-term RSI sufferers. The condition, which mainly affects arms
and hands, is being increasingly associated with computer keyboard work.
The latest offer, described by the management as 'reasonable and equitable'
and 'non-negotiable', includes an ill-health pension and a lump-sum payment
equivalent to at least 12 months' salary. Those who make a full recovery
will also get jobs back 'when suitable vacancies arise, subject to certain
conditions,' said the FT.
The chapel is due to meet today to consider the revised offer. Mr Alan Pike,
father (convener) of the chapel, said: 'The package is obviously better than
the management's original attempt to force people to leave on pensions
alone.' Meanwhile, the threat of industrial action remained, he said.
According to the company, individual sufferers could receive between Pounds
68,360 and Pounds 135,448 when cash sums from the pension scheme were
included.
The union said it was concerned that future pension payments were not
guaranteed and that much of the money the company said was on offer
consisted of individuals' pension or notice entitlements.
The FT said it had spent more than Pounds 1.4m trying to tackle RSI.
