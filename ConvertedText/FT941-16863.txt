FT  07 JAN 94 / Observer: Caveat punter


Why are New York ticket agencies now charging Irish world cup soccer fans
IPounds 250 for tickets with a face value 10 times less? At yesterday's
exchange rates IPounds 250 should fetch some Dollars 330; even New York
banks don't have such usurious currency exchange charges.
The explanation is entirely appropriate for the land where supply and demand
laws reign supreme. The Dublin-based Football Association of Ireland expects
to get 8,000 tickets for each of Ireland's three first-round games in June,
but some 20,000 fans are likely to flock to the US to watch their team.
By May, IPounds 250 might look ridiculously cheap . . .
