FT  15 DEC 94 / Trafalgar House Stalks Northern Electric: Sid in middle of
an unfamiliar battleground - What it means for investors


   By DAVID LASCELLES


If Trafalgar House goes ahead with its bid, it would mark the first takeover
of one of the more than two dozen utility companies which have been
privatised over the last 10 years, writes David Lascelles.
Sid, the proverbial private, first-time investor, who bought many of these
stocks, could therefore find himself in the thick of an unfamiliar battle.
As of last June, Northern had 123,000 shareholders, more than 97 per cent of
whom held fewer than 1,000 shares. But though they represent the numerical
majority, their tiny holdings mean that they account for only 20 per cent of
the vote.
Nearly 80 per cent is held by big investment institutions. The government
only holds one share, but that is an overriding golden share which will
expire next March.
While Sid's relatively small holding means that he would play only a minor
role in a takeover battle, the bidder's financial advisers will have to take
account of his unfamiliarity with bid procedures.
His presence could also sharpen political controversy over the bid if, as
seems likely, Labour uses it to have a go at the alleged financial excesses
of the electricity companies.
So far, only two well-known privatised companies have been subjected to
takeovers: Britoil and Jaguar, and in neither case did the government use
its golden share to block them.
Sid has done well out of Northern. He paid 240p for the shares at
privatisation in early 1990, and last night they stood at more than Pounds
10.
He has also recouped a third of his original outlay in dividends.
