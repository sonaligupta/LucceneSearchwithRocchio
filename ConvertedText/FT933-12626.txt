FT  23 JUL 93 / Ambition trips up holiday companies


   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent


OVER-AMBITIOUS expansion resulted in the collapse last year of 24 providers
of flight-based package holidays - the highest number on record - says the
accounts of the Air Travel Trust Fund, published yesterday.
The accounts show that operators expanded their programmes last year, but
demand failed to match expectations.
The Civil Aviation Authority, which administers the fund, said it had to
arrange the return to the UK of 30,416 holidaymakers after company failures
in the year to March 31. More than half those were customers of Airbreak,
which collapsed last September. The cost of repatriations was Pounds 5.6m.
The authority also had to arrange refunds to 127,910 customers of failed
companies, at a cost of Pounds 12.96m. Nearly half of those who received
refunds were customers of Riva, which failed last February. Riva was set up
by former executives of the International Leisure Group, which collapsed in
1991.
Of the Pounds 18.6m total spent on repatriation and refunds, just less than
Pounds 6m was paid by the trust fund. The fund makes up the shortfall where
the company's bond proves insufficient.
The biggest call on the fund came from Sungate Travel, which collapsed last
March. Sungate's bond fell Pounds 1.7m short of what was needed to
compensate customers.
