FT  20 APR 94 / UK Company News: Reduced Pounds 19m loss at Ibstock Johnsen
 -Reorganisation costs responsible for deficit but outlook optimistic for
1994


   By PAUL TAYLOR


Ibstock Johnsen, the UK's third largest brick maker, yesterday reported a
pre-tax loss of Pounds 18.7m for 1993 after further reorganisation costs of
Pounds 20.7m, but said both its brick and pulp businesses should now benefit
from a gradual increase in demand.
The loss represents an improvement over the Pounds 27.6m deficit recorded in
1992 when reorganisation and closure costs totalled Pounds 26.6m.
The bulk of the 1993 reorganisation costs related to the closure of one of
the group's two Portuguese pulp mills and were disclosed at the interim
stage. These costs were partly offset by a Pounds 4.51m profit on disposals.
Losses per share were reduced to 5.69p (9.86p) and the proposed final
dividend is held at 0.5p, making an unchanged total of 1p.
The shares closed up 1p at 86p.
Group turnover fell to Pounds 235.5m (Pounds 277.4m), but the decline
entirely reflected discontinued operations.
Turnover from continuing operations advanced by 6 per cent, from Pounds
176.6m to Pounds 186.9m.
'For most of the year the group continued to experience depressed markets
and distressed prices, although in the final months there were some signs of
more favourable conditions,' said Mr Colin Hope, chairman.
At the operating level, the UK brick operations improved from Pounds 2.74m
to Pounds 3.03m on sales of Pounds 57.8m (Pounds 54.7m) in spite of the
adverse effect of limit-ing production to reduce stocks.
In the US the building materials operations achieved a modest turnround with
profits of Pounds 808,000 compared with a Pounds 1.64m loss while the
Portuguese building products and sanitary ware activities reported a decline
in operating profits to Pounds 619,000 (Pounds 1.48m) reflecting
deteriorating market conditions.
Uneconomic prices for pulp resulted in the forest products operation
reporting a larger Pounds 4.22m loss on continuing operations compared with
losses of Pounds 2.8m on turnover down to Pounds 37.4m (Pounds 42.3m).
Pre-tax profits were further depressed by net interest costs of Pounds 2.94m
compared with receipts of Pounds 660,000 in 1992.
Group debt fell from Pounds 42.9m to Pounds 35.6m, equivalent to gearing of
18 per cent.
COMMENT
Having completed the reorganisation of the brick and pulp businesses,
Ibstock should now begin to benefit from the steady improvement in demand
for bricks in the UK, higher capacity utilisation and possible price
increases later this year. However, it is difficult to see margins returning
to the heady levels of the late 1980s. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 7m look
likely this year producing earnings of about 2p, but even based on a peak
profit estimate of say Pounds 30m at the top of the cycle the shares look to
be fully valued.
