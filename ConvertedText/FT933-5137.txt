FT  04 SEP 93 / Food & Drink: Three market leaders from Tuscany - An instant
success story


   By EDMUND PENNING-ROWSELL


IT IS rare indeed for a high-quality, high-price wine to become within its
field an international market leader almost on its launch; least of all an
Italian one. Yet this has happened to three: Tignanello, Sassicaia and now
Ornelleia.
Tignanello is the vineyard name of part of the St Cristine Chianti vineyard
of the historic Florentine firm of Antinori, owned today by Marchese Piero
Antinori. Eighty per cent Sangiovese and 20 per cent Cabernet-Sauvignon, it
did not follow the official DOC Chianti grape formula and was launched in
1971 as just a vino da tavola with almost instant success. It combined the
rich fruitiness of old-vine Sangiovese with the elegant bouquet and flavour
of the Bordeaux grape. Production now varies between 15,000 and 25,000 cases
per year.
Sassicaia began differently. It had long been the tradition of rich Italian
families to import wines from France but, in 1944, the Marchese Mario Incisa
planted on his San Guido estate, at Bolgheri on the Tuscan coast, half a
hectare with 85 per cent Cabernet-Sauvignon and 15 per cent Cabernet France,
to yield 2,000 bottles a year for his family consumption.
His wife was the sister of Marchese Piero Antinori's mother and, in 1971/72,
he put on the market the 1968 vintage under the vineyard name of Sassicaia.
A quick sell-out led to gradual extension of the vineyard, which now covers
30 ha and annually yields about 10,000 cases.
Ornelleia is the brain-child of Piero Antinori's brother, Lodovico.
At the end of the 1970s, he decided to establish a winery on the Bolgheri
family estate.
The first vines - 80 per cent Cabernet-Sauvignon, 15 per cent Merlot and 5
per cent Cabernet Franc - were planted in 1980, and the first vintage of
15,000 bottles came in 1985. The vineyard has been steadily increased, and
separate ones started to produce Merlot and Sauvignon wines, and less
expensive blends. The first Ornellaia released on the international market
was the 1989, now followed by the 1990 with 6,250 cases, but more than 8,000
of the '91 and nearly 12,000 of the '92 will be available; and a maximum of
more than 20,000 cases is planned; more than double the neighbouring
Sassicaia's settled total.
On a recent visit, I was fortunate to have vertical testings of all three
wines on their estates. All are made in new oak barriques.
Tignanello '89 - generally, not a good vintage in Tuscany and this lacked
body and was short, but an agreeable, easy-drinking wine. '86 - elegant and
mature with real Cabernet flavour, but to be drunk. '85 - big colour, rich
nose and concentrated flavour. The finest wine of the tasting and Tignanello
at its best. '81 - full colour, line, mature old bouquet, elegant taste, a
classic wine of its kind. '77 - brownish colour, with a chocolate nose, some
dryness on the palate, but a sweet finish. A complete wine. '71 - the wine
of the original vintage had an old claret appearance and flavour, but no
decay. Not only did Tignanello start the fashion for high-quality vino da
tavola, but it has never been rivalled in demand or excelled in quality.
Sassicaia '92 - a barrique sample, with very good colour, elegant nose and
line balance. '91 - also from a barrique, but a lighter wine with an
oak-scented nose. '90 - still closed bouquet and flavour, but full-coloured
and well-structured; should turn out very well. '88 - much more developed,
with full colour but perhaps less roundness and richness. '85 - a supple
wine, ready to drink, but not all that distinguished. '82 - brown-tinged,
but with a rich nose and full, sweet flavour; an exceptional wine at its
peak. '81 showing some age, but elegant and sweet. '78 - exceptional colour
for its age, with a sort, engaging bouquet and light body.
Ornelleia '91 - good colour, but typically light on nose and taste for the
year; short. '90 - very rich wine, with big colour, very rich, oaky nose and
a taste of prunes. Still closed; less concentrated than Sassicaia. '89 - an
easy-drinking, fairly light wine as the vintage mostly dictated. '88 - very
big colour, and concentrated bouquet and flavour. A strong wine, still
tannic and to be kept. '87 - fair colour but lacked fruit on nose, with some
dryness on palate. A moderate-only year, yet still fair drinking.
The Marchese Lodovico clearly has wider ambitions than his neighbour, cousin
and fellow Ornelleia director, Marchese Nicolo Incisa. Yet the latter has
one important advantage. His wines have an average age of 25 years, whereas
Ornelleia's are much younger. Sassicaia is also kept longer in cask. None of
these wines is for early drinking. Style, and quality as well as price,
demand definite if variable maturing times for all three.
Winecellars, London, SW18 (Tel: 081-871-2668) lists Sassicaia '89, Ornelleia
'90 at Pounds 23.85, and Lay & Wheeler (0206-764446), of Colchester, Essex,
has Tignanello 1988 at Pounds 21.80.
