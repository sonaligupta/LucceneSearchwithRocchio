FT  05 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (America): US stocks cautious awaiting
budget vote

Wall Street
US SHARES finished on a slightly easier note after cautious trading
yesterday as markets awaited the Congressional vote on President Clinton's
first budget package, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 9.22 at 3,552.05,
while the Standard & Poor's 500 ended 0.73 off at 448.54. Secondary stocks,
however, fared much better, and the Nasdaq composite gained 4.78 at 713.79,
a record high. Trading volume on the New York SE was 230m shares.
Trading was subdued from the start, and stocks struggled to find a
direction. All eyes were on Washington DC, where President Clinton and his
supporters were making final efforts to ensure that his deficit-reduction
budget is passed by Congress this week.
The President and leading Democrats have predicted confidently that the
budget will be approved, but they expect the vote to be close. Both stock
and bond markets are of the same view, and passage of the budget has been
cautiously priced into values.
However, if the budget falls at the final hurdle (and one senior Democrat
senator warned yesterday that he still had misgivings about the package),
investors fear that bond prices could fall sharply, triggering a big
sell-off in the equities markets. It was this fear that kept many investors
on the sidelines yesterday.
Kmart, languishing near its 52-week low recently, rallied Dollars 1 to
Dollars 21 5/8 in volume of 5.2m shares after the large retailer confirmed
reports that it is looking for a buyer for its Pay Less drugstore operation.
Computer issues were busy. Hewlett-Packard dropped Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars
71 in active trading after brokerage house Smith Barney Shearson lowered its
rating on the stock from 'buy' to 'neutral'. Elsewhere in the sector, prices
were mostly firmer, IBM adding Dollars 1 at Dollars 44 3/8 , Motorola
Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 96 and Digital Equipment Dollars 1 at Dollars 37
1/2 .
A broker's recommendation lifted Sears Roebuck Dollars 2 to Dollars 52 3/4
in a volume of 1.5m shares.
On the Nasdaq market, Apple Computer advanced Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 30
1/4 as the stock continued to benefit from the company's recently announced
price cuts across its products range. Chiron fell Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars
65 as worries about the group's recently disappointing earnings continued to
plague the stock.
Quadrex lost Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 4 3/4 after the nuclear power plant
servicing company posted a second-quarter loss of 59 cents a share and said
it might sell its environmental unit.

THE Toronto market extended its rising trend to seven consecutive sessions
with a small gain in relatively light trading. The TSE 300 index closed 12
points higher at 3,988.5 and advances held an edge over declines by 356 to
348. Volume amounted to 43.6m shares valued at CDollars 509.8m.
The real estate sector, however, dropped 5.26 per cent, while the gold and
silver index fell 3 per cent in reflection of a decline in gold bullion
prices.
