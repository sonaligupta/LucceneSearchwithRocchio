FT  14 APR 94 / Observer: FLT hero


No sooner has BMW gobbled up Rover, than the Germans seem poised to get
their hands on another British success story.
Tucked away inside the Lancer Boss fork lift truck factory is the world's
greatest fork lift truck driver - chief demonstrator Bart Harman.
Leighton Buzzard-based Bart's delicate stunts include constructing a
champagne glass pyramid with the forks of a giant truck and closing a box of
matches with the tyre tread of a 30-tonner - working the machine from
outside the cab, with a piece of string.
