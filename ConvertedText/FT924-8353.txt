FT  11 NOV 92 / International Company News: GM announces plans to raise up
to Dollars 1bn

   NEW YORK


GENERAL Motors, the loss-making US vehicles group in the throes of a
management upheaval, yesterday announced preliminary plans to raise up to
Dollars 1bn through several tranches of fixed-rate preference shares.
The company has already raised some Dollars 4.6bn through common and
preference stock issues this year to bolster its cash resources.
GM, announcing it had filed a shelf-registration, or pre-clearance request
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, gave no timetable for any new
issues, but said it expected to be in a position to make an initial offering
in the next few weeks.
GM said the proceeds would be used for general corporate purposes and added
that fixed-rate preference stock currently represented an attractive means
of providing equity finance to strengthen the balance sheet and provide
financial flexibility.
