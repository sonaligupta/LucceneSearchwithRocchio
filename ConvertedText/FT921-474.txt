FT  28 MAR 92 / NY cancels Dollars 12.5bnpower contract

   NEW YORK, MONTREAL


THE state of New York last night cancelled a Dollars 12.5bn (Pounds 7.2bn)
contract for the purchase of 1m kW of hydro-electric power from
Hydro-Quebec, the Canadian utility that has come under harsh criticism from
environmentalists.
Hydro-Quebec said the cancellation of the contract would not endanger the
company's plans to expand its capacity by constructing generating stations
on the Great Whale River near Hudson Bay, Canada, but it could delay the
project's completion.
The contract was originally signed in 1989 by the New York Power Authority
(NYPA). Mr Richard Flynn, chairman of NYPA, said the contract  - which was
set to run from 1995 until the year 2016 - had been cancelled for economic
reasons. NYPA had made use of an escape clause in its contract because New
York's electricity needs were going to be less than expected and the
forecast price of oil and gas had fallen sharply.
A spokesman for Mr Flynn said that Mr Mario Cuomo, governor of New York, had
recommended the hydro-electric contract be cancelled. Last night Mr Cuomo
said that circumstances had 'changed dramatically' since the contract was
first signed.
Hydro-Quebec said that it had been unable to meet NYPA's request for a 30
per cent price cut.
The cancellation was taken as good news by environmentalist opponents of the
Great Whale generating project. Ms Judith Enck, an environmental activist
from the New York Public Interest Research group, last night forecast that
the project would collapse because of the cancelled contract.
However, Hydro-Quebec said it hoped to reopen negotiations with New York in
about two years time on the basis of new estimates of energy demand.
