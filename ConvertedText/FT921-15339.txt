FT  10 JAN 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Keeping DIY on an even plane


   By DELLA BRADSHAW


PROVING yet again that the simplest ideas are the most effective, a French
company has combined a spirit level with a line winder to produce a tool
which could benefit even the most clumsy do-it-yourself addict.
The Filabulle, marketed by Rauh, of Paris, allows one person to check
surfaces of up to 50 yards. A hook at the end of the line winder - a length
of string which unwinds like a tape measure - fastens the line to the
surface to be checked. The line is then unwound and the small spirit level
slides along the cord. If the surface is not horizontal, the correct plane
can be found by raising or lowering the line winder.
Rauh: France, 1 47 09 36 72.
