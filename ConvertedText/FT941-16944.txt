FT  07 JAN 94 / World Trade News: US to cut China's import quotas


   By REUTER


   WASHINGTON


US Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said his government would cut the
import quotas for Chinese textile products by 25 to 35 per cent from January
17, Reuter reports from Washington.
Mr Kantor announced the unilateral action yesterday, following nine
unsuccessful months of negotiations between the two countries to control
illegal transshipments of Chinese-made products through third nations.
In a statement, Mr Kantor said the new quotas would be applied retroactively
to products entering the US after January 1.
China sold about Dollars 4.5bn in textile and apparel products to the US
last year. In addition, smuggling and illegal transshipments to the US,
which ignore rules on country of origin rules, were estimated at about
Dollars 2bn.
'We have said all along that, if we could not reach an agreement with China
which addressed the problems we have had with textile trade, then we would
have to impose quotas at the levels outlined in this notice,' Mr Kantor
said.
China has been unwilling to agree to provisions - accepted by 16 other
trading partners of the US - that allow US discipline when transshipping
occurs, Kantor said.
China did not accept a US offer for textile negotiations this week.
