FT  20 APR 94 / International Company News: PaineWebber drops 22% in first
term


   By PATRICK HARVERSON


   NEW YORK


PaineWebber, the big US securities house, yesterday reported a 22 per cent
decline in first-quarter profits to Dollars 55.6m, or 70 cents a share. The
fall in earnings was attributed to lower revenues from trading and
investment banking and higher employee compensation and other expenses.
Like many other Wall Street firms, PaineWebber's earnings power has been
diluted in recent months because volatile financial markets and higher US
interest rates have eaten into trading and underwriting profits.
The firm reported a 9 per cent decline in principal transactions (trading)
revenues to Dollars 183.8m, and a 4 per cent drop in investment banking
revenues to Dollars 97.6m. On the trading side, sharp increases in US
interest rates during the quarter took a particular toll of fixed-income
revenues.
Other lines of business, however, remained strong. Brokerage commissions
rose 16 per cent to Dollars 280.6m, and revenues from asset management
jumped 25 per cent to Dollars 91.4m. Growth in asset management revenues and
in total assets under control - which rose 11 per cent to Dollars 136.9bn -
helped boost recurring fees by 25 per cent over the year, so that 54 per
cent of the firm's fixed costs are now covered by recurring fee income,
compared with 47 per cent a year ago.
PaineWebber's total profits, however, declined in the latest quarter, partly
because of a 14 per cent increase in non-interest expenses to Dollars
659.3m. The increase was linked to the hiring of more employees, especially
brokers.
