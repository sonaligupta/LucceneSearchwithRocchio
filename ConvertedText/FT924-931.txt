FT  21 DEC 92 / International Company News: Baldwin makes offer for the
balance of Simpsons


   By TIM BURT


BALDWIN, the group whose activities cover holidays, printing and property,
has announced an unconditional offer to buy any remaining shares in Simpsons
of Cornhill, owner of the City chop house in which it recently acquired
majority control.
The paper offer of one Baldwin share for every two Simpsons values the
restaurant company at Pounds 1.68m, or 37p per share. When the company was
floated on the USM last year investors paid 50p per share.
Since the bid was first announced last month holders of 62.8 per cent of the
ordinary and 450,000 of the 'A' shares, or 75 per cent, have accepted.
The latest move could signal the end of any remaining resistance to the
offer from the rebel group which earlier this year tried to oust the
Simpsons board.
The directors expect, through the enlarged group, to be allowed to expand
the restaurants business in London and the south east.
In addition to Simpsons and the Jamaica Inn in the City, the company also
owns two central London bistros and has management contracts to operate
other eateries such as the Gay Hussar.
