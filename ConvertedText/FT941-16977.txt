FT  07 JAN 94 / Gore backs E Europe-Nato links


US vice-president Al Gore yesterday defended President Bill Clinton's
'Partnership for Peace' proposal for bringing the countries of eastern
Europe into closer association with Nato.
Mr Gore (pictured giving the speech in Milwaukee) argued that supporting the
countries of eastern Europe was in the US's best interests. 'Fostering the
integration of Europe will not only express our highest ideals, it will also
be the best investment we can make in our own security,' he said.
Earlier Russia had warned Nato leaders not to offer east European countries
and Lithuania membership of the alliance, as this could boost extreme
nationalist tendencies in Russia and undermine its reform programme.
