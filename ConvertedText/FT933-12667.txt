FT  23 JUL 93 / Guerrillas in new attack on Israelis


   By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor


THE danger of a big military confrontation in south Lebanon increased
sharply yesterday after Iranian-backed guerrillas launched a new offensive
against Israeli positions and those held by their local allies.
At least one Israeli soldier died in the attacks launched by Hizbollah, the
Lebanese Shia militia, and by the radical Palestinian faction, the Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, headed by Ahmed
Jibril.
They attacked positions within Israel's self-declared security zone in south
Lebanon using artillery, rockets and heavy gun fire. Several members of the
South Lebanon Army, financed and armed by Israel, were also reported to have
been wounded.
Israel has reinforced its presence in the south of Lebanon in response to
Hizbollah attacks on July 8 and 9 which cost the lives of five Israeli
soldiers. Lt Gen Ehud Barak, the Israeli army chief of staff, warned this
week that an attempt to wipe out guerrilla bases would be inevitable if the
attacks did not cease.
Mr Mohsen Dalloul, Lebanon's defence minister, responded that the entire
country would be mobilised if it faced a large-scale invasion.
Israel hit back against yesterday's attacks with artillery fire and
helicopter gunships were in action against suspected guerrilla positions.
