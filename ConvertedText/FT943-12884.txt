FT  22 JUL 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Giving a voice to car
navigation


   By VANESSA HOULDER


The strains of map-reading while driving through an unfamiliar city could be
eased when Amerigon, a Californian company, introduces a voice-operated car
navigation system later this year.
Its AudioNav system, which connects to a car's compact disc player, will
provide recorded voice directions in response to the driver's spoken
commands, which are transmitted through a microphone clipped to the driver's
sun visor.
The system, which uses digital map data converted to an audio compact disc
format, is able to identify the origin of the trip, its destination and the
fastest route. It uses map data, produced by Etak, a Californian subsidiary
of News Corporation, which covers the US and metropolitan areas in Europe
and Japan.
