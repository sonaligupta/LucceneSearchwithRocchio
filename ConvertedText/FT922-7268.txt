downturn

SONY Music Entertainment, the music arm of the Sony group, saw
unconsolidated pre-tax profits fall just over 3 per cent to Y16bn (Dollars
122m) for the fiscal year to March because of the costs of its new listing
on the second section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
Investors were pleased that the drop in earnings was limited to 3 per cent
and bid up the price of Sony Music shares by Y130 to Y4,830 yesterday.
The company which last year signed a contract with pop star Michael Jackson
recorded an after-tax profits decline of 8.8 per cent to Y8.5bn.
But the company saw a strong 10.9 per cent rise in sales to Y92.9bn, thanks
to a 13 per cent increase at its domestic record division to Y52.3bn, and a
16 per cent advance at its international record division to Y12.3bn.
For the year to March 1993, Sony Music expects a 3.8 per cent increase in
sales to Y96.4bn and a 32.9 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y21.4bn.
Sony Chemicals, the videotape manufacturing affiliate, suffered a sharp fall
in earnings due to sluggish demand from the electronics industry.
The company posted a 22.4 per cent decline in pre-tax profits to Y3.1bn on a
5.4 per cent fall in sales to Y36.1bn. After-tax profits fell 21.8 per cent
to Y1.6bn.
Sales of magnetic videotapes, the company's mainstay, fell 13.8 per cent to
Y16.5bn.
Bonding materials, such as industrial glues and tapes, fell 5.9 per cent to
Y8.5bn due to the slowdown in the electrical and construction industries.
Sales of electrical parts grew 20.6 per cent to Y7.3bn, thanks to increasing
demand for camcorders and compact disc players.
For the current year Sony Chemicals expects a slow recovery in demand due to
sluggish capital spending by companies. The company forecasts a 4.2 per cent
fall in pre-tax profits to Y3bn on a 7.2 per cent rise in sales to Y38.7bn.
