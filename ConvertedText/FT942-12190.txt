FT  30 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Two new 'Which?' editions - At a
glance


New editions of two of the staple Which? financial handbooks should save you
from addling your memory with too many boring facts. Which? way to save tax
1994 makes it possible for the self-flagellatory to handle their own tax
affairs. Which? way to save and invest does a splendid job on the mechanics
of investment and savings, though it has understandably little feel for
stockpicking. Both books cost Pounds 13.99 in paperback.
