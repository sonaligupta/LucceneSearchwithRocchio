FT  16 NOV 93 / Observer: Softly, softly


Jacques Delors' failure to turn up at the CBI conference in Harrogate
inevitably led to a suspicion that he had been struck down by a diplomatic
illness. Better to make himself scarce than risk further jeopardising an
already shaky reputation in Britain by being drawn into a row between the
CBI and the government over Europe.
But such speculation was wide of the mark. The European Commission president
really did have the flu and it was up to his secretary-general David
Williamson, once a polished British civil servant, now an equally polished
Eurocrat, to deliver Delors' message.
The script was strictly followed until Williamson reached the bit where
Delors sounded his version of Harold Wilson's reds under the bed scare - the
accusation that there were political scavengers eating away at the
distressed heart of Europe.
Hence the 'unscrupulous individuals and groups' of Delors became the 'some
less than scrupulous' individuals of Williamson. And the 'dangerous forces'
which Delors had at work became less menacing with the thought that 'some
forces may be at work'.
Who these forces are is less than clear beyond the fact that they must
disagree with Delors. Williamson certainly would not elaborate on the plot,
but then he is an Englishman and has a different notion of the sinister from
Delors. Certainly he was careful to tell the CBI that he is not a Frenchman,
not a French intellectual and not a Catholic.
