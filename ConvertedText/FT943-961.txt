FT  27 SEP 94 / Smokers put cities under a cloud


   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor


The unsightly cigarette end was the most consistent litter problem mentioned
yesterday in the first national survey of cities by the Tidy Britain Group.
Bath and Ripon emerged as the UK's cleanest cities. London came eighth and
Manchester bottom of the 57 cities surveyed.
Cities were ranked according to the cleanness of a 1km circle around the
centre. The areas were visited by 54 trained teams which checked for litter,
graffiti, dog fouling, fly-posting and signs of vandalism.
The cities were graded on a scale from A to D. Smoking-related litter,
especially cigarette ends, caused many potential grade A sites to be demoted
to grade B.
The surveys, which covered more than 12,500 sites, were carried in May.
Professor Graham Ashworth, director-general of the Tidy Britain Group, said
it planned to repeat the survey regularly to monitor progress and encourage
higher standards of cleanliness.
The group said that far too many cities - 26 per cent - had to be classified
as unacceptable, but it hoped that the survey would help them target their
resources more effectively.
