FT  13 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: A better level of service won the day


   From Mr BARRY REAMSBOTTOM


Sir, Re your leading article on the extension of privatisation of central
government work ('Forward to Tory basics', November 8), there is a simple
reason why so many of the market tests were won by in-house teams. It is
because these teams, openly and fairly, bid to do the work cheaper and
offered a better level of service than firms in the private sector.
Unfortunately, it was the minister for public service, William Waldegrave,
who insisted on making - without producing one shred of supporting evidence
 -quite fantastic predictions about the level of savings that would accrue
from market testing.
On the other hand, there is already plenty of evidence to show the folly of
opting for further major privatisation. Water privatisation, for instance,
has brought about as much as an eight-fold increase in prices and led to the
directors of the new companies more than tripling their salaries, as well as
being able to exercise many millions of pounds in share options. Who would
now also deny that the decimation of the British Coal industry is directly
attributable to the way in which the privatised electricity generation
companies no longer need to take account of the long term energy needs of
the country?
The truth of the matter, as most informed commentators realise, is that the
civil service has undergone a whole series of efficiency reviews since 1979,
which have reduced the numbers of staff by some 25 per cent.
Next Steps Executive Agencies, which now employs as many as two-thirds of
all civil servants, must also meet very tough financial and quality targets
which are set for it every year by the government.
Last year, against a background of severe economic recession, these agencies
as a whole met three out of every four of those targets, a record most
private sector companies would dearly love to have.
