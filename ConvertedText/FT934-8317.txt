FT  16 NOV 93 / International Company News: Nissan Iberica deeper in red


   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent


NISSAN Motor Iberica, the Spanish arm of the Japanese carmaker, plunged to a
pre-tax loss of Pta28.01bn (Dollars 207m) in the first nine months of the
year from a loss of Pta5.44bn in the same period a year ago.
The heavy losses, which are forecast to total about Pta40bn for the full
year, are forcing the company into a drastic financial restructuring
including the write-off of about two-thirds of Nissan Iberica's equity
capital of Pta60bn.
The company said yesterday that the accumulated losses for 1992 and 1993,
which are expected to total about Pta54bn, would be funded by existing
reserves of about Pta13bn and by an equity write-off. The write-off would
reduce net worth to about Pta20bn.
Nissan, which has 70.3 per cent of its Spanish subsidiary, had planned to
inject a further Pta10bn (Dollars 73m) in new equity into the company
following the provision of Pta5bn in the summer.
Its room for financial action is being constrained by mounting losses in its
worldwide operations, in particular in Japan.
Nissan Iberica is to meet Spanish trade unions at the end of the month to
discuss its proposals to eliminate a further 500 jobs in addition to the 600
it is cutting. The workforce, which totalled 7,200 people at the start of
the year, has fallen to 6,950 and is expected to be cut by about 15 per cent
in 1993-94.
The company's finances have come under acute pressure from the sharp fall in
new vehicle sales in Spain and across west Europe, which has coincided with
heavy capital investments by the Japanese vehicle maker in Spain in new
production capacity and in the development of new models. It is carrying a
heavy burden of depreciation and financing charges.
