FT  20 MAY 92 / EC energy tax plan 'interests' Japanese

JAPAN has expressed 'clear interest' in the EC's proposed tax on energy to
combat global warming, while the US continues to rule out fiscal means to
reduce carbon dioxide emissions, according to Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, EC
environment commissioner.
At last weekend's informal meeting in Bonn of environment ministers of the
Group of Seven most industrialised nations, he said, 'there was clear
interest from the Japanese side. It is not yet an agreement, but not a
refusal. They are studying (the tax) carefully without discarding it.'
The Commission proposal, for a Dollars 10 per barrel of oil equivalent tax
by 2000, levied half on energy value and half on carbon content, depends on
the EC's main industrial partners following suit. Environment ministers of
the 12 are expected to endorse the thrust of this plan on May 26.
At the Bonn meeting the US expressed 'a drastic refusal', Mr Ripa di Meana
said. However, he stressed the 'very powerful boost' to the plan in the
'unprecedented and unexpected support from the World Bank', contained in its
latest development report.
The commissioner believes concerted political pressure could lead Washington
to move further, now that in the run-up to the Rio de Janeiro earth summit
next month, the US has 'accepted the logic of stabilising' CO emissions for
the first time.
The EC's proposed carbon tax would have to be Dollars 36 rather than Dollars
10 per barrel of oil equivalent if CO emissions were to be stabilised in
line with international recommendations, according to an economic report
published today by Ireland's Economic and Social Research Institute, Tim
Coone adds from Dublin.
