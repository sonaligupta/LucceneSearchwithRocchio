FT  10 JAN 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): At the wheel of a virtual car


   By STEVEN BUTLER


NEC, the Japanese electronics company, has developed a virtual reality
network system to enable designers in multiple locations to work together in
real time, designing three-dimensional objects, writes Steven Butler.
The company has written software for the design of a car body which, when
goggles are donned, appears in three-dimensional space on a high-definition
computer screen. The parts of the car can be manipulated and reshaped by
moving hands inside gloves attached to sensors. On the screen, what appear
to be disembodied gloves actually move the objects about.
The breakthrough, say NEC scientists, came in reducing the information flow
between remote computer terminals so that the exchange could be handled by
ordinary engineering work stations. Designers working at any terminal linked
together can each reshape objects on the screen at the same time.
NEC admits the system is still fairly primitive and is unlikely to have
commercial applications for several years. The level of detail on the screen
is low, and the gloves are still not sensitive enough.
One goal will be to increase the size of the system so that objects, like
cars, can appear in three dimensions at full size.
