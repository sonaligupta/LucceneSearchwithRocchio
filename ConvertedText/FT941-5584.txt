FT  05 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Union launches Pounds 10.9m rights issue


   By SIMON DAVIES


Union, the City discount house, yesterday announced a Pounds 10.9m rights
issue to restore shareholders' funds following its disastrous foray into
asset leasing.
The 2-for-5 issue is priced at 150p, and up to 7.6m new shares will be
issued.
The shares fell 6p to 176p.
The announcement follows Union's recent return to profitability under a
revitalised management. Mr George Blunden, chief executive, described the
cash call as a 'balance sheet rebuilding exercise'.
He said Union's discount house had been forced to turn down orders because
of Bank of England regulations on capital adequacy. Shareholders' funds had
fallen from Pounds 81m to Pounds 37.5m between 1991 and 1993.
The cash call may prove to be an interim measure, as it will shore up
capital in existing discount operations, rather than fund development of new
fee earning businesses.
'The future growth is about fee earning services, not raising capital to
build trading positions in the market', Mr Blunden said.
The rights issue represents the final stage in a turnround in Union's
business since Mr Blunden joined the board in June 1992 from Warburg
Securities' discount house. The company suffered pre-tax losses of Pounds
24m and Pounds 16m in 1991 and 1992 respectively, resulting from the poor
performance of its asset leasing businesses.
New management was forced to sell businesses to survive, including
Winterflood, the profitable stockbroking subsidiary.
The company plans to build upon its long-established money markets client
base, by developing fund management, equity and gilt-edged marketmaking,
derivatives and consultancy businesses.
Its discount house and leasing business provided the bulk of the Pounds 4.5m
pre-tax profit in 1993, but future growth will come from new businesses.
Analysts expect profits to reach Pounds 6m in the current year, and initial
forecasts suggest the 1995 outcome should exceed Pounds 7.2m. On a
post-rights price of 168 1/2 p, the shares are trading at a p/e of 10.5 and
a discount to an adjusted net asset value per share of 182p. Brokers expect
the issue to be strongly supported.
