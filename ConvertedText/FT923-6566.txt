   By BILL HINCHBERGER


   SAO PAULO


MANY companies in Brazil are facing delays in orders and investment because
of the political crisis caused by charges of government corruption, a poll
of executives by the American Chamber of Commerce in Sao Paulo shows, Bill
Hinchberger reports from Sao Paulo.
Eighty-one per cent of respondents say the crisis is having negative impact
on their businesses, with 53 per cent noting clients are delaying or
cancelling orders. Some 33 per cent say local investment outlays are being
cancelled or delayed, while 31 per cent report a similar effect on
investment from abroad.
The continuance of Mr Marcilio Marques Moreira as economy minister was 'very
important' to 80 per cent of executives who responded. Mr Moreira has said
of questions about his possible resignation: 'I am working in this
government.'
The parliamentary commission investigating charges of government corruption
presents the draft of its conclusions this morning. On Wednesday the
commission is scheduled to vote on approval of the document.
