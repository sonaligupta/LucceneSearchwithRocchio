FT  29 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Greene King declines slightly to Pounds
21.9m


   By MAGGIE URRY


MR SIMON REDMAN, chairman of Greene King, the Suffolk-based brewer,
yesterday spelt out the costly legacy of its Pounds 104m bid for Morland,
its Oxfordshire rival, which failed last week. He was speaking after
reporting a slight fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 21.9m in the year to
May 3.
Greene King launched its bid for Morland in June and holds a 29.3 per cent
stake, bought at a cost of Pounds 28m or 450p a share. Morland shares closed
unchanged at 418p, and Greene King's fell 1p to 474p.
Mr Redman said the yield on Morland shares at 450p was 2.5 per cent and the
annual carrying cost of the stake would be Pounds 2.25m. The costs of the
bid would be reflected in an extraordinary charge of Pounds 3m in the
current year's accounts.
The cost of buying the Morland shares lifted the group's debt to Pounds 75m
and its gearing to about 33 per cent against 27 per cent at the previous
year end.
Mr Redman said another bid for Morland did not appear attractive, but would
depend on conditions in a year's time when the group would be free under
takeover rules to rebid.
Analysts said it was unlikely Greene King could sell its stake in Morland,
except at a large loss, as other companies would be unlikely to try a bid
where Greene King had failed.
Mr Redman said he was now looking to expand the business organically. The
company has 825 pubs giving it plenty of headroom to expand.
The announcement of the group's results had been delayed until the Morland
bid closed. Pre-tax profits fell to Pounds 21.9m from Pounds 22.1m in the
previous 53 week period.
Mr Redman said trading conditions had been 'extremely tough', but Greene
King's beer sales by volume fell only 2 per cent compared to a 10 per cent
fall in the market in the south-east as a whole.
Group sales improved 1.8 per cent to Pounds 128.6m, and trading profits rose
9.6 per cent to Pounds 25.3m, despite an increase in bad debts from Pounds
1m to Pounds 1.9m. The group's properties were revalued and showed an Pounds
11.6m surplus over the valuation five years earlier.
The net interest charge was Pounds 5.5m (Pounds 4.9m). Property profits fell
from Pounds 3m to Pounds 2.3m. Earnings per share were 40.1p, up 5 per cent,
while a final dividend of 8.1p takes the total to 11.6p.
