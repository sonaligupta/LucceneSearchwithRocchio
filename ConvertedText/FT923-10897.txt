FT  28 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading


   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE


TRADING in stock index futures was dominated by the disappointing
performance from the Wellcome share sale in the equities market, writes
Christopher Price.
The September contract on the FT-SE index opened brightly, early buyers
pushing it up to 2,391 within minutes of the opening. However, in a
20-minute burst the contract collapsed as the Wellcome shares came on to the
equity market and were immediately marked down.
By 9.30am, September had slumped to 2,369, at which point some support was
found and the contract rallied. But continued gloom over the state of the UK
economy, with talk of worse to come in this week's official statistics,
served to further undermine the contract in quiet trading.
What started as a drift early in the afternoon session soon turned into a
sharper decline in the last hour of trading as a softening in sterling added
to dealer's worries. September finally closed at 2,355, 28 points adrift of
Friday's session and at a 5-point discount to its fair value of around 12.
Turnover was 7,459 lots.
In traded options, 23,874 contracts were dealt, 2,880 up on Friday. Asda was
the top option stock, with 3,035 contracts, followed by BP at 1,065.
