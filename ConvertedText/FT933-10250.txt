FT  05 AUG 93 / Responses ran 77% against approval


   By BRONWEN MADDOX


A TOTAL of 77 per cent of the responses to the first public consultation
were opposed to the granting of a licence to Thorp, the Pollution
Inspectorate and the Ministry of Agriculture said yesterday.
Nevertheless the inspectorate found 'no points of substance' that would
cause it to reconsider the terms of the draft licence to start operation.
The inspectorate's 180-page report, published yesterday, concludes that if
Thorp started operating the increase in emissions of the radioactive gas
Krypton 85 would not have a 'significant effect on weather or climate'. Some
environmentalists have argued that the gas could increase the electrical
conductivity of the atmosphere, and might increase the incidence of some
cancers.
The report also says the standards of the proposed licence 'effectively
protect human health, the food chain and the environment generally'.
The inspectorate had to assess more than 80,000 responses, 'significantly
larger than on previous occasions'.
Most of the responses supporting the plant argued that the proposed
authorisations tightened discharge limits. Many unions and local councils
backed the plant because of the jobs it would bring to an area of high
unemployment.
The inspectorate said that of the 'wider policy issues' raised, the most
common was 'that there is no justification for nuclear fuel reprocessing
generally and Thorp in particular'. It did not address this issue, nor
questions of proliferation of plutonium weapons and the risk of accidents in
transporting waste. The second consultation is intended to address these
points.
