FT  30 OCT 93 / International Company News: Singapore Telecom sells well


   By KIERAN COOKE


   KUALA LUMPUR


THE OFFER for a 10 per cent stake in Singapore Telecom (ST), the posts and
telecommunications utility, has been four times oversubscribed, surprising
the most bullish of brokers.
Based on the value of shares offered, the market capitalisation of ST, which
is being partially privatised, was SDollars 55bn (USDollars 35bn).
'It's fairly amazing when you make comparisons,' one analyst said. 'ST is
being valued at about 80 per cent of the market capitalisation of British
Telecom.'
Fifty per cent of the offer, in categories A and B shares, priced at
SDollars 1.90 and SDollars 2 respectively, was available to Singaporeans
only. The rest, the C share category, was open to Singaporeans and
foreigners on a tender basis at a minimum price of SDollars 2.
The offer closed on Thursday after aggressive tendering for C shares pushed
up the strike price to SDollars 3.60, giving a prospective price/earnings
ratio of 48.
While no-one doubts the credentials of ST - which has a monopoly on
Singapore's highly-efficient telecoms sector until 2007 - there are some who
feel many share-buyers have rushed in without thinking.
An abundance of liquidity in Singapore, an influx of foreign funds, and an
intense government campaign to encourage wider share ownership have resulted
in hectic share buying.
It is believed slightly more than a third of the C category shares were
taken up by foreigners.
The Singapore government had structured the ST offer to discourage stagging.
It offered heavy discounts to Singaporeans who would keep their shares for a
six years.
However, analysts say A and B shareholders might be tempted to take a quick
profit. The Singapore stock exchange announced that, from Monday market
hours will double to 12 to cope with the expected surge in trading volumes.
