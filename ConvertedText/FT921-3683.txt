FT  13 MAR 92 / Choice in regional radio may be widened


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


THE Radio Authority is considering launching new regional commercial radio
stations, to extend to the rest of the UK the choice available in London.
The new regional stations would be thematic, offering specialist radio such
as jazz or 'easy listening' formats.
There are 11 London commercial radio services including Jazz FM and Melody
Radio. The authority, the regulatory body for commercial radio, believes
other cities are too small to sustain such a choice in addition to
conventional radio stations.
The potential solution, which will be outlined in a consultative document
next month, will suggest that regions rather than individual cities could
have more choice.
The document will also set out the proposed ground rules for the
re-franchising of the UK's existing commercial radio stations.
Starting later this year, the Authority will begin re-licensing nearly 130
radio services. The work will be tackled in two tranches - first 52 services
followed by a further 77. The total includes the likely splitting of AM and
FM channels to allow more groups into commercial radio, a business which at
the moment produces revenues of about Pounds 140m.
The re-franchising will be under the old rules - the judgment of the Radio
Authority will prevail rather than highest bids, though winners can be taken
over.
Independent National Broadcasting, which last month made the highest bid of
Pounds 4.01m a year for the second national commercial radio franchise, is
expected to issue a fund-raising prospectus next week. The company plans to
raise Pounds 14m and is talking to a number of potential trade investors to
lead the fund-raising exercise.
The authority would like to see evidence of the company's ability to raise
the necessary financing by the end of this month.
