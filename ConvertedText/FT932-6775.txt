FT  27 MAY 93 / CBI calls for infrastructure agency


   By ANDREW TAYLOR


THE GOVERNMENT should establish a separate agency to promote joint
infrastructure investment ventures between the public and private sectors,
Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry,
said yesterday.
Mr Davies, speaking at a CBI conference, said that the Treasury did not have
'sufficient firepower to overcome inertia, resistance, even obstructionism
in the rest of Whitehall and elsewhere in the public sector'.
Private sector involvement in investments traditionally financed by the
public sector required a degree of partnership between government and
industry 'which has been all too rare in the UK'.
He said investors would need to be clear about the rules under which joint
ventures would be approved, particularly what financial contributions the
government might be prepared to make in order to take account of wider
social and economic benefits arising from a development.
They would also need assurances on planning and political risks which could
change the commercial nature of a project. Speeding up the planning process
would increase the attractiveness of projects for the private sector.
'Intellectual property rights need to be better protected so that companies
which bring forward innovative projects to government do not fear losing
their investment when that project is subsequently put out to tender,' said
Mr Davies.
The higher cost of private finance, he said, would be offset by improved
management and cost control.
