FT  25 MAR 92 / Amnesty accuses Indian police of 'routine' torture

THE torture of suspects by police has become routine in India, according to
Amnesty International, which today publishes a report on human rights abuses
in India.
Amnesty lists 415 deaths as a result of police brutality between 1985 and
November 1990, but says the true number is likely to be higher.
In its report - India: Torture, Rape and Deaths in Custody - Amnesty says
that in only three cases listed were police convicted of the use of torture,
and in only 42 cases were judicial inquiries ordered.
'A major cause of the persistence of widespread torture in India', the
report says, 'is the failure or unwillingness of leading government
officials and representatives to acknowledge that torture even exists, let
alone that it needs to be vigorously tackled.'
In an effort to arouse public opinion and press the government into action,
Amnesty is distributing 5,000 copies of the report to prominent Indians, and
calling on Indians to write to the prime minister and the home minister.
Amnesty's campaign comes at a embarrassing time for the government, because
of the country's dependence on bilateral and multilateral aid, and because
donor nations are increasingly linking aid to respect for human rights.
The government yesterday accused Amnesty of having launched an anti-India
campaign.
The report says the use of torture has been most systematic in Kashmir, the
Punjab and Assam, where the government faces armed opposition. Otherwise, it
says the main victims of police brutality are the poor or minority groups -
untouchables, tribal people, and Moslems.
