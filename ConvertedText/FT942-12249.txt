FT  30 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: A difference that is more than just
semantics


   From Mr CHRISTOPHER CONWAY


Sir, I read with interest Lucy Kellaway's excellent article, 'Game rules in
black and white' (April 25). However, her assertion that competencies 'may
include skills, knowledge, understanding and will-power' is fundamentally
flawed.
Our latest research at Ashridge indicates that it is necessary to separate
competence, identified as qualities or attributes, from competencies which
are management behaviours in a role.
The failure to identify these two distinct yet complementary elements lies
at the root of much of the confusion surrounding the successful
implementation of competencies for top managers.
It is not just a question of semantics.
