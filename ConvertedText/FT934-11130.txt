FT  02 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Bolton falls to Pounds 142,000 after Langho
losses


Pre-tax profits at Bolton Group, the property investor, fell from Pounds
202,000 to Pounds 142,000 in the year ended April 30.
The result was struck after losses relating to the Langho Nursing Centre,
which had been disposed of, the directors said, as it required a
disproportionate amount of management time and would not gen-erate the
target return required.
Since the year end the decision has also been taken to dispose of certain
investment properties, which will result in a reduction in debt of about
Pounds 5m.
Turnover was Pounds 2.46m (Pounds 1.83m). Net interest took more at Pounds
1.24m (Pounds 1.13m) and earnings per share came to 1.6p (2.2p).
