FT  27 JUN 92 / Brussels moves on TV rights


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


Screensport, the European satellite sports channel, seems to be winning its
long battle to gain equal access to television rights to international
sports events, writes Raymond Snoddy.
The European Commission has told the European Broadcasting Union (EBU),
which groups Europe's public service broadcasters, that it wants Screensport
to have equal access to coverage of the Barcelona Olympics. If it does not,
'interim measures' could be taken against the EBU. The EBU bought exclusive
rights to the Olympics and 24-hours-a-day coverage will be available to
Eurosport, a channel backed by a group of EBU members.
