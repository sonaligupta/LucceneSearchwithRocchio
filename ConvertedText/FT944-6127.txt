FT  30 NOV 94 / International Company News: Authorities clear Union Pacific
bid for Santa Fe


   By RICHARD TOMKINS


   NEW YORK


Union Pacific, one of the seven biggest US railways, yesterday appeared to
be heading for victory with its Dollars 3.2bn hostile takeover bid for Santa
Fe Pacific, another of the big seven railway companies, after the federal
regulatory authorities removed Santa Fe's main objection to the offer,
writes Richard Tomkins in New York.
The Interstate Commerce Commission, which regulates mergers in the US
railways industry, said it was prepared to accept Union Pacific's plan to
buy Santa Fe's shares immediately and put them in an independent trust
pending the ICC's consideration of the takeover. Earlier Santa Fe had
rejected Union Pacific's bid, saying it was not clear whether the ICC would
accept the trust arrangement.
The ICC's decision puts Union Pacific at an advantage over Burlington
Northern, the friendly bidder for Santa Fe, because Burlington's agreed
Dollars 3bn bid would not take effect unless and until it had received ICC
clearance - a process that could take a year or more.
Santa Fe yesterday declared a two-week postponement of the shareholder vote
on the merger with Burlington Northern, announcing a new date of December
16.
