FT  03 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Drugs sector in demand


   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON


REPORTS FROM the US that the Clinton administration's health care reforms
will not impose mandatory price increases on prescription drugs sent
pharmaceutical shares in London sharply forward in hefty turnover.
Speculation over the US health care issue has dogged pharmaceutical stocks
on both sides of the Atlantic for several months now, and investors, taking
their cue from yesterday's report, cast off their doubts and went on a
buying spree. By the London close, Zeneca had surged 33 to 760p with 8.7m
traded, Glaxo was up 22 at 636p on turnover of 13m, and Wellcome had climbed
26 to 755p with 3.9m dealt. SmithKline Beecham added 20 at 457p.
However, health care analysts were somewhat cautious. Dr Jonathan Gelles at
US broker Wertheim Schroder warned: 'Investors are running away with the
idea that no mandatory price increases will lead to higher profits for the
industry. However, the fundamental problems of the industry remain and drugs
companies will continue to incur below par operating profits for some years
to come. We continue to be selective in our recommendations.'
Other specialists said that in spite of the press reports they believed that
the Clinton reforms would include voluntary price restraints which would
have much the same effect as mandatory ones.
Meanwhile, fears that President Clinton will turn to the tobacco and drinks
industry in order to help fund his reforms knocked several related stocks in
the London market. Among these, Allied-Lyons tumbled 16 to 610p, Grand
Metropolitan 10 to 445p, Rothmans 19 to 697p and Guinness 16 to 493p.
Dealers said Guinness was also affected by a French press report suggesting
that the group was considering increasing its holding in LVMH, the luxury
goods group, to 35 per cent. The two companies already have a 24.6 per cent
cross-shareholding.
