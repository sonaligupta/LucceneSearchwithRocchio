FT  07 MAR 94 / Leading Chinese activist disappears


   By REUTER


   BEIJING


Mr Wei Jingsheng, China's most famous dissident, left Beijing suddenly
yesterday, hours before he was scheduled to meet reporters, Reuter reports
from Beijing.
Mr Wei was expected to talk about his detention by police in a clampdown
before this week's visit to China by Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of
state.
His abrupt disappearance came as the official Xinhua news agency accused him
of violating his parole and police extended their crackdown by taking away a
prominent student leader of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests.
Mr Wei's secretary told reporters the activist had left voluntarily. She
said she did not know if police had advised Mr Wei to leave for Mr
Christopher's visit, a tactic the authorities have used in the past at
sensitive times.
The sweep against more than a dozen prominent dissidents in Beijing and
Shanghai has cast a pall over Mr Christopher's visit to China, scheduled to
start on Friday.
Mr Christopher has said the issue of human rights was the top priority for
his visit, a last-ditch attempt to warn the Communist party it will lose
billions of dollars in trade with its key market unless it improves its
treatment of dissidents.
President Bill Clinton must decide by June whether to renew China's Most
Favoured Nation trading status. He has repeatedly stated he would only do so
if there was a 'significant overall improvement' in China's human rights
record.
