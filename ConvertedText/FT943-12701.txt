FT  23 JUL 94 / The sounds of a continent cracking: The west must recognise
its self-interest in dealing with the crisis engulfing Africa


   By MICHAEL HOLMAN


'The record is grim and it is no exaggeration to talk of crisis . . . What
is needed is a new kind of social compact, an agreement within the world
community that the struggle against poverty in Africa is a joint concern
which entails responsibilities for both parties'  - World Bank, 1981
The warnings have gone unheeded. Now come signs of a continent under
intolerable strain, poised between crisis and catastrophe, lacking both the
capacity and the will to implement economic and political reforms.
Rwanda is the latest in Africa's roll call of disasters over the past 20
years, during which at least 10m people have died and as many have become
refugees. For some governments, the strain has proved too much.
Zaire, almost straddling the waist of Africa, is less a state than a
collection of fiefdoms. Sudan, Africa's largest country, has been destroyed
by civil war, and Sierra Leone, Liberia, Somalia, Angola are joining them.
Worse may be to come, for two of Africa's most important countries are now
at risk: Nigeria in the west and Kenya in the east are both showing signs of
stress.
Nigeria's leaders squandered Dollars 100bn of oil earnings over the decade
of the oil boom from the 1970s to the early 1990s. External debt, currently
Dollars 34bn, rises by Dollars 6bn a year, the civil service is undermined
by political interference and corruption, per capita gross domestic product
has halved since 1980, the fault line is deepening between Moslem north and
Christian south.
Meanwhile Kenya is battling against impossible odds. Its population has
tripled over the past 20 years to 25m, land hunger grows, unemployment
rises, and 400,000 school-leavers compete annually for 20,000 jobs in formal
employment. Corruption and vested interests stand in the way of effective
reform.
Meanwhile Africa's rare 'success stories' such as Ghana and Uganda, are not
inspiring. 'Current growth rates among the best (emphasis added) African
performers are still too low to reduce poverty much in the next two or three
decades,' warned a recent World Bank review.
The Bank's hopes, back in 1989, that African economies could grow at a rate
of 4 to 5 per cent proved optimistic. Growth has been barely half that, well
below the region's 3.2 per cent annual rise in population. Unless
Sub-Saharan Africa's 'poor' economic policies improve, it will be 40 years
before the region returns to its per capita income of the mid-1970s, says
the Bank.
Dissenting voices suggest ways out of the predicament. 'More aid]' cries
one.
But aid has increased and the crisis deepens. Net aid transfers to Africa
increased from 5.6 per cent of regional GDP in the early 1970s to 8.3 per
cent in the late 70s, reaching 11.7 per cent of GDP by 1990. Sub-Saharan
Africa's share of global aid is up to 38 per cent in 1991 from 17 per cent
in 1970. A decade of structural adjustment, and net aid flows of Dollars
170bn, has stemmed the region's decline but not launched a revival.
'Reform the international trading system,' cry others, pointing to Africa's
deteriorating terms of trade. Perhaps, comes the response, but why has
Africa lost its market share of cocoa, tea, coffee to other third world
countries who live under the same system?
'Foreign investment is the key,' say others. But who will invest in a
continent where the infrastructure has deteriorated, skills are in short
supply, and instability endemic?
'Impose democracy by making aid conditional on good governance,' say western
governments. But democracy isn't working; and +++++++ End of Leg 3
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
the World Bank's report on the 'east Asian miracle' suggests there is not
necessarily a link, says another.
What can be done?
First, the World Bank, the continent's leading donor, and the aid agencies
must find common cause. Africa needs their vigorous lobbying of the west's
decision makers. John Clark, who used to work with Oxfam, put it well in his
book, Democratising Development: The Role of Voluntary Organisations.
Non-governmental organisations, he says, 'will make little headway unless
their ideas are grounded in economic reality and unless they search for
positive as well as negative lessons within the programmes of the World Bank
and other practitioners of development orthodoxy.'
Once there is agreement on the economic and political agenda,
non-governmental organisations should play a greater role. In certain
countries, where the mangement capacity of government is weak, NGOs should
run primary health care, or primary education, or drought relief.
The private sector should make investment decisions, rather than aid workers
without the necessary skills. Increase transparency. Too often donors are
willing to conceal what they know of corruption in African governments. They
fail to insist on minimum levels of accountability and access to
information. By withholding or denying African electorates information about
structural adjustment programmes, they stifle debate about economic policy.
Constitution making. Hopes for the revival of democracy will be dashed
unless Africa draws up constitutions which take account of ethnic, religious
and regional differences. Rebuild the parties and institutions of democratic
government. Set levels of military spending at a percentage of GDP below
spending on housing, education and health. Radical measures to ease Africa's
debt burden should be accompanied by tougher monitoring of reform policies,
including donor officials in institutions such as central banks and finance
ministries.
If governments are not willing to embrace structural adjustment and good
governance requirements, then donors should only finance humanitarian
projects.
Above all, the west must be motivated by self-interest as much as compassion
in its response to the African crisis. Possible solutions will only be
implemented when an ailing Africa is seen as a threat and as a loss.
As Africa's economy declines, so immigration to southern Europe will rise;
Moslem extremism will intensify; drug-trafficking will increase; disease,
whether Aids or the discovery of bubonic plague in Zaire, will pose a
serious health problem; environmental erosion or neglect will lead to the
destruction of valuable flora and fauna.
Africa cannot be ring-fenced: and the longer a co-ordinated response to its
crisis is postponed, the more daunting become the problems and more serious
the consequences of failure.
