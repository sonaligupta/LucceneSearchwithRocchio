June 30, the company said yesterday.
The boost in Australian sales followed Ceramco's purchase of Hickory
Fashions.
Ceramco doubled interim pre-tax profits after extraordinary items to
NZDollars 15.03m (USDollars 7.9m). Sales rose 26 per cent to NZDollars
78.24m.
Net profits edged ahead to NZDollars 7.5m from NZDollars 7.17m.
