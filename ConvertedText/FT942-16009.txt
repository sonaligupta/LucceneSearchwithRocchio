FT  12 APR 94 / Belgium steps up Kigali rescue

Belgian paratroopers were yesterday beginning a high-risk operation to
rescue the remaining foreign nationals scattered across the Rwandan capital,
Kigali, the scene of bloody inter-tribal massacres.
But with the Rwandan rebels reported to be marching on the capital,
prompting fears of further clashes, the Belgian defence ministry said of
foreigners trapped in outlying areas: 'We do not envisage for the moment
pushing our action further than Kigali - it is not possible given the
difficulties we are experiencing in Kigali itself.'
The first group of Belgians to leave Rwanda yesterday were returned to
Brussels, with several hundred more expected to be evacuated from the centre
of Kigali later today. Several hundred French and US nationals also left
Rwanda yesterday.
There are currently 400 Belgian paratroopers in Kigali.
Rwanda, a former colony of Belgium, was previously estimated to have some
1,500 Belgian residents, the largest group of any foreign nationals.
Six Belgian civilians have been killed in the fighting, in addition to the
10 Belgian soldiers serving with the United Nations forces massacred on
Thursday, the Belgian government confirmed.
Three of these were killed in the northern town of Gisenyi at the beginning
of the fighting, with the remainder killed more recently in Kigali, said Mr
Willy Claes, Belgium's foreign minister.
The killings have provoked outrage in Belgium, fuelling fears that the
violence may have taken a particularly anti-Belgian twist, particularly
among the majority Hutu tribe, which has accused the Belgians of supporting
the rebels.
