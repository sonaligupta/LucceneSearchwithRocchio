FT  19 APR 91 / Insurance assets down


   By PETER MARSH


NON-LIFE insurance companies showed a net disposal of Pounds 53m of assets
last year, compared with a net increase in assets in 1989 of Pounds 2.2bn,
according to Bank of England figures published yesterday, writes Peter
Marsh.
The disposal was mainly effected through selling securities. It was caused
largely by the need to meet claims arising from a variety of worldwide
disasters.
Unit trusts increased their assets last year by Pounds 621m, compared with
an increase in 1989 of Pounds 4.9bn.
