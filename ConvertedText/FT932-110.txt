FT  30 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Waddington falls 16% to Pounds 6m


   By PEGGY HOLLINGER


LOSSES ON the disposal of a subsidiary depressed profits at John Waddington,
the packaging, printing and games company which yesterday revealed a 16 per
cent decline at the pre-tax level to Pounds 6.1m for the year to April 3.
The results - according to new accounting standard FRS 3 which, in effect,
eliminates extraordinary charges - showed a Pounds 9m loss on the disposal
of the business forms subsidiary. Excluding the loss, operating profits rose
by 14 per cent to Pounds 18.1m on sales 4 per cent lower at Pounds 221.6m.
The shares closed 11p higher at 230p.
Mr Martin Buckley, chief executive, said the disposal of business forms for
Pounds 1.3m had eliminated annual trading losses of Pounds 1.8m.
Meanwhile, Waddington's core packaging operations in the US and UK had
performed particularly well following the heavy capital expenditure
programme of the last five years. Profits were ahead by 7 per cent to Pounds
12.3m on static sales of Pounds 125.6m.
The growth was expected to continue this year, with the most significant
opportunities in the US.
The performance in packaging was dampened by a disappointing performance
from the labels division. The loss of a substantial contract with Heinz last
year had adversely affected this business, leaving it with losses of Pounds
900,000. However, this included one-off redundancy costs of Pounds 400,000.
Mr Buckley expected the labels operation to approach break-even by the
year-end.
The final dividend is maintained at 4.3p, for a maintained total of 7.9p.
Earnings under FRS 3 fell from 4.93p to 3.19p. However, stripping out the
loss on disposals, they rose from 11.6p to 13.71p.
