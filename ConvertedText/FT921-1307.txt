If you are playing Dodge The Demagogues with more and more desperation and
less and less success you might think of turning to radio. At 7.30 Radio 3
begins a live broadcast from Poole of a concert by the Bournemouth Symphony
Orchestra: Mozart's overture to Idomeneo, Elgar's cello concerto (soloist
Erling Blondal Bengtsson), and Vaughan Williams' 'London' symphony. The
Radio 4 series In Business (9.00) considers the position of secretaries in
Sweden where, it is said, they are encouraged to gain more qualifications
and take on more responsibility, and in Britain where they are made
redundant. In the first of the new series Carry On Up The Zeitgeist Edward
Blishen reconsiders the hugely popular wartime radio comedy 'ITMA' (11.00).
This week Inspector Morse abandons Oxford and heads for Verona. Using all
your knowledge of Morse and sidekick Lewis guess which is in his element in
northern Italy, hobnobbing with a beautiful opera singer (Frances Barber)
and which yearns to go home (8.00).
Rembrandt (8.10 BBC2) investigates the alarming speed at which the number of
supposedly authentic masterpieces is being reduced.
