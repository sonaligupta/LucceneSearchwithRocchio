FT  29 JUL 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market report


   By REUTER


A SHARPISH fall in ALUMINIUM prices was the main feature of a quiet day the
London Metal Exchange. The cash price reversed the uptrend of the two
preceding trading days to close Dollars 17.50 down at Dollars 1,327.50 a
tonne in a follow-through to a technically weak close on Monday. Dealers
said chart patterns remained a bearish influence on the market. Another rise
in LME warehouse stocks of aluminium came as no surprise and had little
influence, but in the NICKEL market a 2,274-tonne stocks rise was a major
factor pushing prices lower. At the close the three months price was Dollars
82.50 down at Dollars 7,560 a tonne. COPPER prices were also lower in
sterling terms but that was entirely due to the currency factor. The cash
position's Pounds 7 fall to Pounds 1,320.50 a tonne translated into a
Dollars 2 rise in terms of the weakening US currency. The retreat of the
PLATINUM price continued following news of a wage settlement being agreed at
Impala of South Africa. The price fell Dollars 2.50 to Dollars 375 a troy
ounce, taking the fall over the last three trading days to Dollars 8.40 an
ounce. Profit-taking ended COCOA'S rally and the September futures price
closed Pounds 11 down at Pounds 599 a tonne.
