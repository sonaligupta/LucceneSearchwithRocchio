FT  28 APR 94 / World Trade News: BMW may seek Mexico partner


   By JOHN GRIFFITHS


BMW is considering seeking a local partner with which to develop a planned
assembly facility in Mexico and will make a decision by June, writes John
Griffiths.
The German carmaker said it was 'too early' to pre-dict likely production
vol-umes or employment levels, but confirmed Mexican re-ports that it
intended to have the facility operational, assembling cars from kits, by
mid-1995.
Its own projections of the investment involved in the plant and setting up a
distribution network are understood to be much smaller than indicated by
Mexican government sources, at around DM300m (Pounds 120m).
The company said the cars would be sold only in the Mexican market.
