FT  29 APR 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (17): A more
optimistic outlook - The professionals / The downturn has happened, and only
one of our fund managers remains bearish


   By PHILIP COGGAN


The mood of caution that prevailed among our four fund managers at the end
of 1993 proved to be justified. The Federal Reserve's two increases in US
interest rates prompted sharp falls in bond and equity prices in the first
quarter.
Now the downturn has occurred, however, they are, on balance, feeling more
positive. Paul Myners, of Gartmore, who doubled his cash holdings last time,
is reinvesting the cash in Japanese equities and US bonds. 'We are now more
positive on world markets and wish to be fully invested,' he says.
Even Howard Beaufort, of Newton Investment Management, who has generally
been the most cautious: feels more chirpy. 'The correction will hopefully
prove short and has certainly proved sharp.' He believes that 'fundamental
value is now back into both equities and bonds, particularly in the US and
the UK'.
Tim Howe, of Singer & Friedlander, argues that 'the scenario of improving
growth and relatively loose monetary policy continues to suggest equities as
the most rewarding investment.'
Most bearish is Douglas McDougall, of Baillie Gifford. He thinks that the US
interest rate rise has 'worrying implications for most markets', and he is
accordingly cutting his equity exposure and increasing the cash element of
his portfolio to 15 per cent.
Tim Howe says: 'Although our overall exposure to equities has been little
changed over the quarter, there has been a shift in our strategy; at current
levels, value is apparent in the UK equity market. In continental Europe, we
no longer like France, where the government seems indecisive in its approach
to the fundamental restructuring of companies that is required. Italy looks
as if it has further to go, and the industrial exporters in Germany look
relatively attractive.
'Although the US market was slower to react to rising bond yields than other
world markets, the fall has probably been overdone, and we are increasing
our US exposure, partly because we believe the dollar should appreciate.
'Correctly, in January, we thought that a number of the Far Eastern markets
appeared oversold, and we suggested that we would be taking profits in Hong
Kong, Singapore and Malaysia and reinvesting in Japan. We have increased our
holding in Japan to 6 per cent of the portfolio. As we forecast, we have
been taking profits in Australia and now retain 3 per cent in Australia and
Mexico.'
Howard Beaufort has made only minor changes to his portfolio. He says: 'In
the face of the first quarter's declines, we have retained a defensive
portfolio stance, invested in sound earnings growth stocks round the world.
On any further panic falls, we would be buyers on both a short- and
longer-term view.
'In continental Europe, we continue to believe that interest rates may not
fall far and fast enough to produce the level of economic recovery implicit
in current share ratings. In the Far East, Tokyo remains highly volatile.
Although the immediate economic and profits outlook does not make equities
look particularly attractive, it appears that fiscal 1994 will be the
turning point for Japanese corporate profits.
'In south-east Asia, almost all markets have undergone a significant
correction since the beginning of the year. With the US investor so
important to these markets, further volatility may be anticipated, but we
retain the utmost faith that this area will produce highly attractive
returns. While the US bond market will continue to look ahead to the next
Fed tightening, with the speculative froth now blown firmly away, the
outlook for UK gilts and European bonds appears fundamentally sound.'
'Our asset allocation moves last time added value, as we were moving to a
more liquid position, anticipating a market correction,' says Paul Myners.
'We sold 2.5 per cent holdings in US small cap stocks, the Pacific rim and
Europe. The former two declined over the quarter and the latter was broadly
level.
'Contrary to our expectations, however, the UK was one of the worst
performing developed markets over the quarter. The results season went well,
but profit recovery was insufficient to offset the valuation implications of
bond yields, both real and nominal. Small companies did well, being more
sensitive to positive economic news, and we would strongly recommend that
private investors have an exposure in this area. On the big stocks, it is
probably too late to panic. From this point, we are likely to see a good
return from UK stocks.
'The US bond market should rally strongly, helping all world markets.
Although US equities should benefit, they look expensive relative to bonds.
We have changed our stance on Japan. although we are worried about the level
of the yen. We would hedge the currency risk on Japanese equities, back to
the US dollar if possible. Pacific markets are likely to follow the major
markets but be more volatile.'
Douglas McDougall recalls that 'three months ago, we raised cash from each
of our equity areas and from long gilts and decided to hold the cash in
dollar form.
'The US economic recovery is well advanced now, the cycle of liquidity has
moved into a less favourable stage and shares still look expensive by
historical standards. In the UK, profits should grow quite strongly this
year and next. Although the equity market is statistically expensive by
historical standards, it continues to look reasonable value in international
terms. The main threat to the equity market has come from gilts, where it is
difficult to find a fundamental justification for the severity of the recent
falls.
'In Europe, further cuts in short-term rates should be helpful, but equity
markets are already discounting a substantial recovery. In Japan, the recent
stock market bounce has been led by overseas buyers and has been compounded
by the yen's strength. The market is at low levels by the standard of the
late 1980s, but still looks expensive in terms of company earnings.
'Earlier this year, we made some moves to increase liquidity and to shorten
bond portfolios. The rise in gilt yields may have gone far enough, but for
this portfolio, each of the principal equity sectors is being reduced
slightly to raise cash to 15 per cent.'
