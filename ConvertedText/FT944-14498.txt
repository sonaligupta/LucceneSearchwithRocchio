FT  22 OCT 94 / International Company News: Japan's brokers stall at halfway
 -Securities


   By EMIKO TERAZONO

Interim earnings at Japan's leading brokers were held back by
lower-than-expected stock market volume which resulted in reduced stock
broking commissions. Most securities houses had expected average daily
turnover to total about Y400bn (Dollars 4.1bn) for the first half to
September, but brokerage officials said the actual figure had been about
Y350bn, down 15 per cent from a year earlier.
They also blamed the reduction in bond trading profits due to the bond
market fall earlier this year.
In spite of reduced costs, the fall in revenues hit all brokers, with only
four - Nomura Securities, Daiwa Securities, Nikko Securities and Kosei
Securities - out of the top 20 managing to avoid losses on the after-tax
profit level.
Salomon Brothers in Tokyo said equity brokerage commissions declined by 20.4
per cent for the top 20 brokers. Underwriting commissions were up 38.2 per
cent while gains from stock and bond trading fell 60 per cent.
At Nomura, the industry leader, income from stock brokerage commission fell
14.6 per cent to Y51.2bn, while underwriting commissions rose 3.8 times to
Y11.5m thanks to active convertible bond issuance.
For the full year to next March, the company expects a 38 per cent rise in
recurring profits to Y70bn on a 3 per cent increase in operating income to
Y410bn.
Daiwa's stock brokerage commission income fell 25.1 per cent to Y36.8bn and
stock underwriting commission income fell 11.4 per cent to Y2.6bn.
For the full year, the company forecasts a 23 per cent decline in recurring
profits to Y40bn and an 8 per cent fall in revenue to Y273bn.
Nikko saw its stock brokerage commissions fall 20.8 per cent to Y38.7bn but
stock underwriting commissions rose 2.4 times to Y7.3bn.
The group expects recurring profits to fall 14 per cent for the full year to
Y30bn on a 7 per cent decline in operating income to Y260bn.
Yamaichi posted a 22.7 per cent drop in stock brokerage commissions while
stock underwriting commissions rose 3.6 times.
For the full year, the company expects a 27 per cent fall in recurring
profits to Y13bn and a 3 per cent reduction in operating revenues to Y228bn.
The smaller brokers, which rely more heavily on stock brokerage commissions
from retail clients were especially hard hit by the sluggish market volume
and the inactivity among individual investors. Sanyo Securities, which faced
an erosion of its market share posted a recurring loss of Y13.5bn, while New
Japan, Wako, and Okasan which managed to return to the black for the year to
last March, fell back into the red.
Of the 10 second-tier brokers, only Sanyo and Kankaku are forecasting losses
on the recurring level. However, since the estimates are based on
projections that average daily turnover will total Y400bn-Y450bn, analysts
expect many of the other smaller brokers may not achieve their forecasts.
