FT  26 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Canada to extend patent rights on
brand-name drugs

CANADA has abandoned a controversial policy, adopted more than two decades
ago, of forcing brand-name pharmaceutical companies to license their
products to generic drug makers.
The federal government has tabled a bill lengthening patent protection for
medicines from 17 to 20 years, and giving them the same protection as all
other products. Prior to 1987, when the rules were first tightened, generic
companies could apply for manufacturing rights within two or three years of
a drug coming on the market in exchange for a modest royalty fee. Generic
medicines are usually priced 15-20 per cent below brand-name competitors,
and the government estimates that the new legislation will add CDollars 75m
(Pounds 33.7m) to Dollars 125m to the total cost of drug purchases over the
next five years.
The two dozen or so Canadian generic producers have been a thorn in the side
of the international pharmaceutical industry for many years. Besides
undercutting prices in the domestic market, they have been active exporters
of cheap medicines.
