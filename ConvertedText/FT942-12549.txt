FT  29 APR 94 / Oxfam warns of Rwanda genocide


   By MICHAEL HOLMAN, Africa Editor


The lives of up to half a million Tutsi in Rwanda are in 'grave danger,' the
British aid agency Oxfam warned yesterday, adding that the 'pattern of
systematic killing' in the central African country 'amounts to genocide'.
Only 30,000 Tutsi refugees had crossed the river which marks the
Rwanda-Burundi border, said Mr Maurice Herson, an Oxfam official. The
refugees had been attacked along the way, and some had been mutilated, with
their fingers or one foot cut off, rather than killed.
Refugees have told aid workers that local militias have systematically
hunted and killed people.
When violence first erupted on April 6, says Oxfam, it appeared that forces
within the Rwandan government armed and directed its youth militias to
attack the Tutsi and also Hutu liberals and opponents of the regime.
Despite calls by ministers in the new Rwanda government for an end to the
massacres, the militia have continued to slaughter Tutsi.
'It appears that the attacks are being incited and organised by powerful
political and military groups,' said Oxfam yesterday.
