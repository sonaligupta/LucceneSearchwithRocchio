General Satish Nambiar, commander of the United Nations peace-keeping
operation in Yugoslavia, yesterday issued an urgent appeal to Serbian and
Croatian leaders to halt all fighting, after at least nine people had been
killed in the worst day of bloodshed in Croatia since the ceasefire on
January 3, writes Laura Silber in Belgrade.
Artillery duels between Serbs and Croats spread across Croatia and into the
neighbouring republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina. The death toll has now reached
19 in worsening skirmishes since Sunday. In the worst single incident
yesterday, four people were killed when a shell hit a bus station at Osijek.
