FT  01 DEC 94 / Brussels' answer to slow payers


   By EMMA TUCKER


   BRUSSELS


The European Commission yesterday proposed that member states introduce laws
giving businesses the right to charge interest on late payment of trade
debts. Representatives of small businesses believe the proposal will do much
to banish the practice of late payments which strain the finances of
Europe's small and medium-sized enterprises. Other recommendations for
tackling the problem of late payments include a commitment to guarantee
enterprises simple and cheap access to the courts and shortening the time in
which government contracts are paid to a maximum of 60 days. The
recommendations have yet to be presented to member states. Mr Raniero Vanni
D'Archirafi, commissioner responsible for enterprise policy, said a wide
consultation by the Commission had shown that late payments were at the root
of serious problems for small enterprises struggling to balance their books,
and that differences in national legislation constituted an obstacle to the
smooth functioning of the single market.
