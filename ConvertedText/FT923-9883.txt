FT  03 AUG 92 / Vote-buying alleged in Nigeria


   By REUTER


   LAGOS


Violence and vote-buying marred the first of Nigeria's presidential
primaries for candidates for December's elections, according to state radio
yesterday, Reuter reports from Lagos.
Violence erupted in Borno state in the north, where agents for some of the
20 candidates vying to become the first civilian president in a decade
openly distributed cash, the radio said. In Katsina state, also in the
mainly Moslem north, the independent Sunday Champion said: 'Agents of some
candidates watched helplessly as the electoral process was being raped.'
Primaries arranged by the left-of-centre Social Democratic Party (SDP) and
the conservative National Republican Convention (NRC), both created by the
army, were held in five states on Saturday. Similar exercises will be
conducted on the next five Saturdays until all 30 states of the federation
are covered.
The two winners will contest a December 5 presidential poll.
