GROUPE AG, the Belgian insurance company, is to raise BFr7.5bn (Dollars
208m) in a rights issue to pay for part of its planned acquisition of
ASLK-CGER, the Belgian state-owned savings and insurance group, writes
Ronald van de Krol in Amsterdam.
The BFr34.9bn acquisition is being made by AG and by Amev, the Dutch
insurance company, through their jointly-owned vehicle, the Fortis financial
services group.
AG had said that it may make a share issue as part of the financing package.
Amev will also contribute BFr7.5bn to the acquisition, with the remainder of
the financing to be met by companies within the Fortis group. Some of these
funds were generated by recent divestments of stakes held in Generale Bank
and Banque Bruxelles Lambert of Belgium.
