FT  29 JUL 92 / C4 chief 'asked for police help'


MR MICHAEL GRADE, chief executive of Channel 4, asked for Special Branch
help because of fears for the safety of those making a controversial
programme on Northern Ireland.
Staff of Box Productions, which made Committee, a documentary claiming to
expose collusion between the Royal Ulster Constabulary and loyalist death
squads, were all re-housed because of the danger they faced, Lord Williams
QC said yesterday.
He was defending Channel 4 and Box in a contempt-of-court action under the
Prevention of Terrorism Act for refusing to disclose the identity of the
main source for the death squad allegations.
Lord Williams said the fear was not just for the safety of the source: there
was also 'responsible and proper' fear for the safety of the company's
staff.
Mr Andrew Collins QC, for the Department of Public Prosecutions, said that
no journalist could give a complete undertaking to any source that he would
in no circumstances disclose his identity.
He added that the allegations made in the programme 'may be complete rubbish
 -and probably are'. Nevertheless it was essential for them to be properly
investigated because if there was any truth in them a very serious situation
had been disclosed.
Mr Collins added that to make sure that Channel 4 and Box were in no doubt
that the court order should be obeyed, the DPP was suggesting the
sequestration of their assets.
No fines were being sought against the company directors at the moment,
although that situation might change. The judges reserved judgment but said
they hoped to give their decision later this week.
