FT  21 OCT 92 / International Company News: Chemical Banking surges 35% in
quarter


   By ALAN FRIEDMAN


HIGHER net interest revenues and an ability to contain the rise in bad debt
provisions helped Chemical Banking, the third biggest US commercial bank, to
turn in a 35 per cent increase in its third quarter net profits, to Dollars
282m.
The improved net, which translates into earnings per share of 98 cents,
against 95 cents a year ago, is in line with the better earnings achieved
earlier in the week by Chase Manhattan, another big New York-based bank.
Chemical, which was formed last year by the merger of Manufacturers Hanover
Trust and Chemical, said its bad debt provisions in the third quarter were
Dollars 330m, above the Dollars 313m of a year ago but less than the Dollars
345m of this year's second quarter.
Net loan write-offs totalled Dollars 330m, against Dollars 307m in the third
quarter of 1991.
Mr John McGillicuddy, Chemical's chairman, said the bank's results were
helped by a 15 per cent rise in net interest income, to Dollars 1.16bn, by
strong trading profits and by improvements in fee-based services.
He forecast a decline in both bad debt provisions and non-performing assets
'going forward'. Non-performing assets in the third quarter declined
slightly year-on-year, to Dollars 6.59bn from Dollars 6.66bn.
Mr Walter Shipley, Chemical's president, said the bank's merger-related
cost-cutting programmed was ahead of schedule.
The bank's Tier One risk-based capital ratio was a healthy 7 per cent at the
end of September, up from 5.6 per cent a year ago. That ratio reflected
Dollars 1.7bn in new common equity raised by the issue of stock last January
and by retaining Dollars 447m of earnings generated during the first nine
months of 1992.
For the first nine months of the year Chemical's net income was Dollars
782m, up by 36 per cent from the same period last year.
On Wall Street, Chemical's share price was marked Dollars  1/2 higher to
Dollars 33 3/4 .
