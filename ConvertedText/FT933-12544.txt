FT  23 JUL 93 / Observer: Softly softly


If John Major reckons it has been a tough week, he might like to ponder the
fortunes of the opposition Indonesian Democratic party (PDI) at its annual
conference in Sumatra.
The PDI won just 15 per cent of the vote in last year's general election and
it appears that the government, in power for over 20 years, is getting a
little bored with easy domination. Hence, it was the founder of the ruling
Golkar party, President Suharto himself, who opened the conference, calling
on the PDI to get its act together.
As if his presence were not enough, he was followed by the home affairs
minister and the chief of the armed forces entreating their opponents to
unite.
No sooner had they left than 50 rebel PDI members tried the other approach.
Storming the venue in a pick-up truck, they knocked down the entrance gates,
and seized the floor shouting 'Kill Surjadi', the PDI chairman. 'This is our
congress, so please sit down,' the rebels' leader bellowed.
Order was re-established just in time for the minister of defence to give
his speech.
