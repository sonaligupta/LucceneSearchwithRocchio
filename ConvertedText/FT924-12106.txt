FT  22 OCT 92 / Smiths Industries reports 7% fall: Strong performance by
medical systems side offsets decline by aerospace division


   By ANDREW BOLGER


SMITHS Industries said a strong performance by its medical systems division
had partly offset a drop in profits from the UK-based group's civil and
military aircraft businesses.
Smiths' pre-tax profits fell 7 per cent to Pounds 102.2m on sales of Pounds
635.3m, down 3 per cent. The group's shares closed 21p up at 329p.
Mr Roger Hurn, chairman, said: 'These results prove our resilience in a
tough economic climate. The performance of our medical system group was
outstanding, and both aerospace and industrial sustained good profit
margins.' Strong cash generation helped increase the group's net cash from
Pounds 79.1m to Pounds 120.1m. Mr Hurn promised to continue to invest both
internally and by acquisition.
Aerospace, which makes cockpit avionics systems, saw operating profits drop
20 per cent to Pounds 48.5m, although it still contributed just over half of
group operating profits. Turnover fell from Pounds 431.3m to Pounds 389.6m,
but Mr Hurn said the division had done well to achieve a 12.5 per cent
margin on sales, while securing important business on both commercial and
military aircraft.
Medical systems increased operating profits by 11 per cent to Pounds 29.2m
on turnover which rose from Pounds 125.3m to Pounds 133.4m.
Smiths said the growing market for its single-use devices for surgery and
intensive care was fuelled by worldwide demand for better protection from
cross-infection for staff and patients. Medical systems' markets suffered
less from the effects of recession, and this had benefited the medical
capital equipment business.
Operating profit from Smiths' industrial group was unchanged at Pounds 15.8m
on turnover of Pounds 133.4m (up from Pounds 125.33m). The group benefited
from the inclusion of the US ducting company Flexible Technologies, which it
bought for Pounds 33.3m at the end of the previous year. Smiths said the
excellent performance of the acquisition had offset the decline in existing
businesses.
Mr Hurn said the industrial group now comprised a cohesive group of
companies, all with good niche market positions. Although affected by
recession, they had achieved satisfactory results, generating margins and
cash which were exceptional for the engineering sector.
Earnings per share fell to 23.3p from 25.2p but a final dividend of 7.15p
(up from 6.8p) gives a total for the year of 11.25p, up from 10.7p.
