FT  30 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Switch is seen back into
German equities


   By Our Markets Staff


WALL STREET's overnight gains inspired the early closing markets, but this
stimulus was noticeably absent in the afternoon, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT extended the 15-point gain it saw in Thursday's post-bourse, the
DAX index closing 30.54 higher at 2,069.00, virtually flat on the official
week. Turnover recovered from DM6.9bn to DM9.5bn.
Ms Barbara Schulz at Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, observed that English
investors have returned to the market after a long period on the sidelines,
and that this may have affected individual stocks. For instance, the metals
and engineering group, Metallgesellschaft, saw a gain of DM17.50, or 4.6 per
cent to DM401.50 on a big UK order. British institutions were probably
trying to find underperformers, said Ms Schulz.
News based movers included Volkswagen, which rose DM7.20 to DM394 on its
four day week and retreated to DM390.50 later as its works council chairman
poured cold water on the idea; and Bayernverein, up just 50 pfg on the
session but accelerating to DM528 in the afternoon after the bank publicised
its restructuring plans.
AMSTERDAM remained in good spirits, although the CBS Tendency index closed
off a year's high of 137.7, up 0.3 at 135.9 and down 0.8 per cent on the
week.
Doubts over the future direction of the proposed link-up between four
European airlines, including KLM, weighed on the Dutch carrier, and the
shares moved down 70 cents to Fl 39.70. Problems have surfaced this week
over the choice of a US partner, with KLM having links with Northwest and
Swissair with Delta.
Heineken fared better, rising Fl 1.20 to Fl 201 on the day and 2.7 per cent
on the week. Kleinwort Benson's Dutch team has recently issued a buy note on
the brewer , and noted good sales for the group's products in the US,
eastern Europe and the far east.
The team said that it had upgraded its 1993 eps to Fl 12.70 from Fl 11.50 in
1992; it added that the disappointing share price performance over the past
12 months had been partly a consequence of an over reaction to the recent
bottling scare, as well as the market's neglect of defensive stocks.
In the chemicals sector, both DSM and Akzo lost some of Thursday's gains as
investors took another look at DSM's third quarter results. DSM slipped 70
cents to Fl 102.10 and Akzo Fl 1.70 to Fl 179.30.
PARIS settled lower on the expiry of futures and options. The CAC-40 index
lost 14.03 to 2,181.95, down 2.2 per cent over the week.
Canal Plus shed FFr20 to FFr1,328 in spite of returning a 9 per cent rise in
third quarter turnover, while Elf Sanofi was off FFr10 at FFr989 in reaction
to news that its Yves Saint Laurent division was to be prohibited from using
the 'Champagne' brand name in a new product range. YSL is to appeal against
the court ruling.
Michelin rose FFr2.00 to FFr181.50. Merrill Lynch upgraded its rating on the
stock during the week, and expected the price to rise by over 30 per cent
during the next 12 months.
The brokers said in support of this view that first half earnings had been
depressed by a FFr2.6bn restructuring charge, covering the period up to
mid-1995. 'This brings a degree of predictability to the path of earnings
recovery which will be absent in the rest of the European automotive sector
in 1994 and even in 1995.'
MILAN's improvement stemmed partly from victory by the government in a vote
of confidence. The Comit index rose 7.66 to 583.41, down 1.7 per cent on the
week.
There was activity in Ifil and Rinascente as the former began its bid for 33
per cent of the retailer, which is being sold by Fiat as part of its
financial restructuring. Shares in Ifil added L117 to L5,114, while
Rinascente lost L40 to L9,462 and Fiat was unchanged at L3,723. The tender
period closes on November 19.
MADRID featured a Pta90 gain to Pta2,740 in Banesto, which reported a 76 per
cent drop in nine-month profits but said that it was sacrificing immediate
profits for a stronger balance sheet.
The general index rose 1.65 to 308.20 for a 0.7 per cent fall on the week.
STOCKHOLM saw its second record high helped by strong gains in the bank and
insurance sector. The Affarsvarlden general index rose 4.9 to 1,426.2, a
rise on the week of 0.6 per cent. Turnover was estimated at SKr1.8bn.
S-E Banken A shares put on Skr1.50 to SKr60.00 and Handelsbanken A SKr2 to
SKr112. OSLO rose to a new 1993 high as the All Share index put on 9.37 to
613.99, in turnover of NKr655m. COPENHAGEN posted a recovery after two days
of declines, the KFX index rising 1.42 to 103.65, a fraction higher on the
week. DDL, which controls the Danish share of SAS, rose DKr110, or 4.8 per
cent to DKr2,400 on speculation that the Alcazar airline alliance is falling
apart.
