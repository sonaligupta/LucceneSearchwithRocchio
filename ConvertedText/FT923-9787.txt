FT  03 AUG 92 / Bush approves sale of subsidised pork


   By REUTER


   WASHINGTON


PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday authorised the first subsidised sales of
pork to the Commonwealth of Independent States, an action long sought by US
grain and pork producers, Reuter reports from Washington. The move will let
the former Soviet republics buy up to 30,000 tonnes of pork at prices
subsidised by the US government.
'This initiative will enable an otherwise competitive US industry to fight
unfair competition and gain an important market share in a potentially vast
market,' Mr Bush said. The initiative marked the first time pork had been
offered under the Export Enhancement Programme which had been used in the
past mainly to promote wheat and rice sales abroad. The White House called
the decision to authorise pork sales 'pro-farmer, pro-jobs and pro-trade as
it fights unfair foreign competition'.
The CIS has made virtually all of its purchases of US food with US loan
guarantees and has used up outstanding credits authorised by the Bush
administration.
