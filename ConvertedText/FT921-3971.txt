FT  11 MAR 92 / Observer: History repeats?


If the US Presidential election does boil down to a Bush/Clinton contest,
then it will have strange echoes of the contest of 1884.
The Republican candidate's surname then began with B - James Blaine. He came
from Maine (one of Bush's many home states) and doubts were expressed about
his veracity, rather like Pat Buchanan's forceful denunciation of Bush for
reneging on his 'Read my lips. No new taxes.' statement. The jingle of the
time was 'Blaine, Blaine, We gave him a pain, The continental liar from the
state of Maine.'
The Democratic candidate also coincided; his surname started with the
letters Cl - Grover Cleveland - and he was dogged by sexual scandal. After
admitting to fathering an illegitimate child, the opposition jingle was 'Ma]
Ma], Where's my Pa?, Gone to the White House, Ha] Ha] Ha].'
Those who believe in omens will want to know that Cleveland won.
