FT  19 MAY 92 / People: Non-executive directors


THORN EMI, the music and electrical rentals group, has appointed Harald
Einsmann, president of Procter & Gamble in Europe, the Middle East and
Africa, as a non-executive director.
Einsmann, a German national, is the first member of the board from the
continent. Thorn has substantial operations in continental Europe and felt
it would be helpful to have someone on the board with extensive marketing
and management experience there. The group already has one Canadian and one
US member on its board.
Einsmann, 58, joined Procter & Gamble in 1961 and became group vice
president for Europe in 1984. He is responsible for P&G's operations in 28
countries including the UK and is based in Brussels.
