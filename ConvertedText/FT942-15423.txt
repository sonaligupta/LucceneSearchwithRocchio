FT  15 APR 94 / BA intensifies fares war


British Airways yesterday intensified the air fares war it sparked three
weeks ago by launching a second package of bargain fares covering virtually
its entire UK domestic and European networks.
The fare cuts of up to 50 per cent will involve more than 200 routes and
will be available from today until May 6 for travel up to the end of June.
Fares on BA's domestic trunk routes are being cut by a quarter with return
flights between London and Aberdeen, Belfast, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness,
Jersey, Newquay, Newcastle and Plymouth costing Pounds 70. Return fares
between London and Manchester and on a number of internal Scottish routes
have been cut to Pounds 50.
There are also savings of more than Pounds 500 for leisure travellers to
South America, a Pounds 99 saving on the return flight to Boston and a
saving of Pounds 109 on a return ticket to Washington.
Most of the promotional fares need no advance booking. Trips to Europe and
North America must include a Saturday night and those elsewhere must be for
at least a week.
BA said more of the 'World Offer' fares would be introduced when the current
batch of discounts closed.
