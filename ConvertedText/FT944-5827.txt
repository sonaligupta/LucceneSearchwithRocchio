FT  01 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Renewed buying helps
Nikkei over 19,000

Active buying by public funds and investment trusts boosted share prices and
the Nikkei 225 average recovered the 19,000 level for the first time in six
trading days, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index added 149.13 at 19,075.62, rising above 19,000 for the first time
since November 21, and having moved between 18,943.79 and 19,134.03.
Equities moved higher on purchases by public postal and insurance funds,
which absorbed arbitrage selling and profit-taking by overseas investors in
the afternoon.
Volume was 300m shares, against 168m, with public funds buying some 20m
shares. The Topix index of all first section stocks advanced 17.59 to
1,520.41, while the Nikkei 300 rose 3.44 to 280.08. Gains outscored declines
by 802 to 232, with 138 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
put on 4.26 at 1,255.50.
Short-covering by overseas investors boosted banking shares. Some traders
said the buybacks could signal an end to the Nikkei's declines since selling
of bank shares ahead of the sector's interim results announcements last week
had prompted the downturn of the index. Dai-ichi Kangyo Bank rose Y70 to
Y1,760 and Bank of Tokyo Y30 to Y1,480.
Brokerage issues, recently depressed on fears of weak earnings due to the
stock market decline, were also bought back. Daiwa Securities firmed Y30 to
Y1,290 and Yamaichi Securities Y19 to Y726.
High-technology stocks, which reported firm interim earnings owing to
increased demand, gained on active buying. Toshiba, up Y1 at Y692, was the
day's second most active issue, followed by Hitachi, Y22 higher at Y977.
Steels and shipbuilders were also heavily traded. Nippon Steel, the busiest
stock of the day, added Y5 at Y384 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries gained Y5
at Y734.
Privatisation stocks lost ground on profit-taking. Japan Tobacco fell Y1,000
to Y963,000 and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Y5,000 to Y840,000.
Petroleum shares declined on the government's continuing push to deregulate
the sector: Showa Shell Sekiyu dipped Y50 to Y1,180.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 280.11 to 21,178.34 in volume of 14.7m
shares. Ono Pharmaceutical rose Y190 to Y4,720.
Roundup
The region was mixed, with the outlook for US interest rates again proving
an inhibition. Manila was closed for a public holiday.
HONG KONG fell 2.2 per cent amid renewed worries about higher US interest
rates, and with index futures falling sharply. The Hang Seng index lost
192.00 at 8,466.26, off a day's low of 8,428.57, in turnover that grew to
HKDollars 3.9bn from Tuesday's HKDollars 3.2bn.
New stocks replacing two Jardine companies and a pair of textile groups in
the index failed to find support.
Guangdong Investment fell 10 cents to HKDollars 4.40, Amoy Properties
declined 15 cents to HKDollars 7.70, Oriental Press retreated 20 cents to
HKDollars 4 and Johnson Electric slipped 50 cents to HKDollars 19.80.
SEOUL saw profit-taking and institutional selling in the afternoon which
more than wiped out strong early gains. The composite index ended 6.85 lower
at 1,074.41, after hitting a high for the day of 1,092.03, in volume that
picked up to 38.2m shares from Tuesday's 31.2m.
TAIPEI fell in slow trade due to caution ahead of Saturday's elections. The
weighted index shed 24.38 to 6,363.72 in turnover of TDollars 26.85bn.
Food shares, after gains in recent sessions, encountered profit-taking, with
President Enterprises down TDollars 1 to TDollars 56.
SYDNEY was little changed overall after recovering from early losses on
worries about interest rates following news of higher than expected
third-quarter GDP data. The All Ordinaries index, after a day's low of
1,881.4, lost just 0.6 on balance at 1,890.7 in turnover of ADollars 479m.
WELLINGTON was hit hard by a rise in local interest rates, the NZSE-40
capital index receding 13.68 to 1,990.97.
Salmond Smith Biolab suffered another fall, closing at NZDollars 2.20, down
25 cents, prompting a stock exchange enquiry. The company said it expected
to appoint a new chief executive today and would be examining annual
forecasts.
SINGAPORE was firmer, although the mood was hesitant in response to the
uncertain trend of Wall Street. The Straits Times Industrial index put on
9.29 at 2,242.09.
QAF rose 13 cents to SDollars 1.66 amid speculation that Indonesia's Salim
Group might be about to increase the 8 per cent stake it recently acquired.
KUALA LUMPUR was driven higher by a spate of late foreign buying, the
composite index adding 9.44 at 1,013.13.
BANGKOK gained ground, spurred in the last few minutes of trade by a jump
staged by the finance and building materials sectors. The SET index closed
9.10 ahead at 1,362.44 in Bt3.99bn turnover, while the finance group climbed
1.3 per cent on Bt541m volume.
BOMBAY was lower, with mutual funds absent as buyers, and state elections,
the results of which are not due until December 10, making for a cautious
mood. The BSE-30 index fell 25.68 to 4,124.18.
Barclays de Zoete Wedd, however, believed that India could be among Asia's
top performing stock markets next year, in spite of expectations of a poor
election outcome for the ruling Congress party in the southern states of
Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.
