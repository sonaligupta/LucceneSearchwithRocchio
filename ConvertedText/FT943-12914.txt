FT  22 JUL 94 / Training cuts 'cause destitution'


   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff


Thousands of vulnerable young people leaving school this week will become
unemployed and destitute because of government pressure on Youth Training
schemes, says the Children's Society.
A report published by the charity yesterday examines what happens to young
people with special training needs when they are placed on what the society
believes are inappropriate training schemes.
Many special-needs training schemes, often run by charities, are closing or
facing closure as the government squeezes funds for YT and Training for
Work, a programme for unemployed adults. Special-needs schemes are generally
more expensive than mainstream ones.
The report is based on the experiences of young people from one of the
society's special training projects in Nottingham. It said the project
provided successful training and support for school leavers with learning,
emotional and behavioural problems.
Funding cuts imposed by Greater Nottingham Training and Enterprise Council
forced the project to close last year. Its users were moved to mainstream YT
schemes which the society said were unable to cope with the young people's
special needs.
