FT  27 JAN 94 / Electricity consumers to call for price cut


   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor


Electricity consumer representatives are to ask regional electricity
companies to cut their prices to coincide with the introduction of value
added tax on domestic fuel in April.
The chairmen of the 12 regional consumers' committees have decided to press
distribution companies to share more of their rising profits with consumers.
'With lower coal prices, lower interest rates and boasts of large reductions
in employee numbers and operating costs, the benefits of privatisation for
the ordinary, non-investing customers have been totally inadequate,' they
said.
Although many electricity companies have given rebates to their customers,
these have not matched the growth in profits.
Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour's consumer spokesman, yesterday called for an
immediate cut in electricity prices, claiming that they had risen well ahead
of inflation since privatisation of the industry in 1989.
