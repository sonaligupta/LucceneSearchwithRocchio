FT  08 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Boeing warns of battle for clients -
Excess capacity will boost competition despite fast growth in demand


   By GERARD BAKER


   TOKYO


Demand for air travel in Asia will be the motor of growth for the world's
airlines and aircraft makers in the next two decades, the president of
Boeing, Mr Philip Condit, said yesterday.
However, excess capacity among manufacturers will produce an increasingly
difficult competitive environment, despite the rapid growth in demand for
new aircraft.
Mr Condit told an audience of Japanese businessmen that Boeing expected
world air travel to triple in the next 10 years. More than a fifth of that
growth was forecast within Asia, with a further 40 per cent linking Asia
with Europe and North America.
In China alone, rapid economic expansion was expected to increase the number
of airline trips per person by 20 times within 15 years.
That rate of growth would mean that by 2015 the country would have become
the third largest market for commercial aircraft after the US and Japan.
Airbus Industrie, the European aircraft manufacturing consortium and Boeing
rival, estimates that China will buy 300 aircraft during the next 10 years -
some 25 per cent of expected world deliveries. Airbus has been taking steps
to strengthen its presence in the fast growing Chinese market, and last week
announced the establishment of a flight crew training centre in Beijing.
Boeing and McDonnell Douglas already operate similar facilities. Boeing,
which manufacturers part of the tail section for its 737 aircraft in China,
believes local manufacture helps in local sales. Mr Condit said the global
travel surge would translate into far higher demand for aircraft, with an
extra 700-800 commercial jets needed in the next 20 years. But since
aircraft makers were left with the capacity geared for earlier commercial
booms and military demand of cold war proportions, 'this will be a market
that has excess capacity until well into the next century'.
Boeing could single-handedly meet the extra demand for aircraft out of its
own capacity, he said. The result would be 'intense competition and intense
pressure on prices' for manufacturers and a 'difficult environment' for
airlines.
Mr Condit also said Boeing was studying plans to build a small 80-100-seat
passenger airliner to replace the company's 737 and rival McDonnell
Douglas's DC-9 models.
Last week China signed a contract for 34 V2500-powered McDonnell Douglas
MD-90 airliners with engines produced by International Aero Engines. The
first MD-90 is scheduled for delivery in early 1996 and half the aircraft
will be manufactured in China with US-supplied parts.
Mr Condit said that Boeing was considering 'a very large commercial
transport project' with 'huge costs and huge risks'.
