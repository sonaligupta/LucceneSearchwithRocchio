FT  23 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Your Price changes hands


   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent


FOSTER Menswear, owned by its management after a Pounds 1 buy-out from Sears
last September, has given Your Price, its loss-making chain of discount
clothing stores, to Mr David Tucker, chairman of Be-Wise, another discount
retailing chain.
'I didn't pay anything for it. I got given it,' said Mr Tucker as he
explained that the 85 stores of Your Price would be run as an independent
company. He set up a new company, funded by himself with Pounds 100,000 of
equity, to take over Your Price.
Mr Tucker is buying from Sears, for Pounds 2.2m, the freehold of 20 Your
Price stores. Ownership of the remainder is in the hands of institutional
landlords. But the Your Price leases on the stores have been assigned to Mr
Tucker's new company at a reverse premium - that is, Foster paid Mr Tucker
to take them.
Mr David Carter-Johnson, managing director of Foster said: 'In six weeks we
have successfully sold on the only fringe business we have.' Your Price
stores, with turnover of Pounds 18m, are generally half the size of the 250
Foster clothing stores, which collectively produce yearly sales of Pounds
100m.
Passing Your Price on to Mr Tucker means that Foster has cut off a
loss-maker. 'The major basis of the mbo is cost reduction,' said Mr
Carter-Johnson.
The combined Foster-Your Price business cost Sears Pounds 30m in two and a
half years. But Mr Carter-Johnson said the mbo company should make a small
profit in its first year.
