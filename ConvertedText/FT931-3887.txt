FT  13 MAR 93 / Fishermen call for EC ban on imports of Russian cod


   By JIMMY BURNS


FISHERMEN's leaders yesterday called for a European Community import ban on
Russian cod but held back from supporting a blockade of ports.
Officials of the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations, which
represents most fishermen in England and Wales, called for the ban during a
meeting in Grimsby, where fishermen this week stopped lorries from
delivering Russian fish to the local market.
The decision not to back a more widespread campaign of protest action
reflects the wish of fishermen's leaders not to fuel the kind of violent
protests that have occurred in France.
The UK Association of Frozen Food Producers yesterday warned that any import
ban could lead to a shortage of fish by the summer.
Mr Geoffrey Molloy, the association's chairman, said: 'Banning cod imports
will not help the consumer and will certainly not help prices. The increases
in landings which the fishermen complain about are, in fact, caught by UK
fishermen themselves.'
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said yesterday that the
government would not back the fishermen's call for a ban at next week's EC
council of fisheries ministers.
'We need to look after the fish-processing industry . . . It is a big
business in the UK,' the ministry said.
Mr Stephen Pearse, assistant port manager at Grimsby, warned yesterday that
action might have to be taken against fishermen if the unofficial blockade
began to affect the port's business. He added that the blockade this week
was not as big as some reports had suggested.
