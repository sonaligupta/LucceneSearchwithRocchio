FT  26 MAY 93 / Observer: Gunning for Betty


At least Commons speaker Betty Boothroyd is assured of the best of advice
while pondering how to respond to Sir Hal Miller's explosive remarks to the
arms-for-Iraq inquiry. Her secretary, Nicolas Bevan, is the very same civil
servant who, as an MoD official, testified to the cross-party trade and
industry select committee on the same subject in 1992.
Then he made the important revelation that ministers were not informed of an
official demarche to the Belgian government in December 1989 over a contract
won by the Belgian company PRB to supply the propellant for a high-velocity,
long-range gun to Iraq. The committee later said it was 'astonished'
ministers were not informed.
From Bevan, who became speaker's secretary earlier this year, emanated
arguably the most consummate piece of civil service-speak heard during the
committee's evidence-taking.
Asked whether British Intelligence might have discovered that a 'massive
gun' had been set up on a hillside in Iraq, he replied: 'Well, it is always
unwise to rule out anything.'
