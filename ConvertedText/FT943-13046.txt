FT  21 JUL 94 / Improving business confidence reported


   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff


Improving business confidence is leading both manufacturers and service
companies to increase their workforce, with skilled manual workers the main
growth category, the British Chambers of Commerce said yesterday.
But the chambers warned that growing numbers of businesses were reporting
difficulties recruiting staff, particularly skilled manual workers.
The difference between manufacturers reporting staff increases and those
reporting cuts was a positive 11 per cent, up from 0 per cent in March.
The proportion in the service sector was a positive balance of 12 per cent,
with a balance of 17 per cent expecting to increase staff in the next three
months.
But 45 per cent of manufacturing companies and 44 per cent of service-sector
businesses reported recruitment difficulties. This was the largest
proportion reporting recruitment difficulties since 1990. The main shortage
was skilled manual workers.
The survey, which covers 7,935 companies in services and manufacturing,
shows that companies are now reporting moderate, albeit patchy, growth.
Manufacturers were the most buoyant group, with a positive balance of 35 per
cent reporting increased exports last quarter. Investment intentions
remained relatively good, with a balance of 21 per cent of manufacturers
saying they intended to boost investment in the next quarter.
Meanwhile business confidence grew in both sectors over the quarter, with a
majority of companies now expecting improved profitability next year.
