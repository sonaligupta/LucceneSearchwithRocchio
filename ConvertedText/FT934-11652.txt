FT  30 OCT 93 / BAe wins Seawolf missile contract


BRITISH Aerospace, the defence equipment and aircraft manufacturer, has won
a contract from the Ministry of Defence worth 'more than Pounds 100m' for
its seaborne Seawolf missile.
Mr Jonathan Aitken, minister for defence procurement, yesterday said the
order would 'sustain some 100 jobs within the company, and many more at
sub-contractors throughout the country'.
BAe said: 'The engineering order book is full but straightforward production
contracts are quite welcome at the moment.'
The contract, for 450 of the vertically launched anti-aircraft and
anti-missile missiles, is BAe's second from the Royal Navy. They will be
built at BAe Dynamics' site at Lostock, Lancashire, and fitted to the Type
23 frigate, the core of the Navy's surface fleet.
