FT  19 MAY 92 / UK Company News: John Wood surges to Pounds 16.9m


   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent


JOHN WOOD Group, the privately-owned Aberdeen-based company, increased its
pre-tax by 78 per cent, from Pounds 9.5m to Pounds 16.9m, in 1991.
The group is one of Britain's leading providers of oilfield services. It
lifted sales by 44 per cent to Pounds 173.8m (Pounds 120.8m).
Mr Ian Wood, chairman, said that much of the larger turnover resulted from a
greater volume of offshore servicing activities in the North Sea, where the
group now operated on the basis of long term contracts with the major oil
companies.
However, margins on those 'partnering' arrangements were lower than in the
days before long-term contracts became common.
The group was also strengthening its non-oil activities especially in the
field of gas turbine maintenance, where it had joint ventures with a number
of gas turbine manufacturers.
Mr Wood said the North Sea was entering a challenging phase as oil companies
faced a squeeze on their profits because of the reduction in oil prices,
while at the same time carrying out big refurbishment programmes to extend
the life of their installations.
Some exploration and new field developments plans were being delayed.
In January, Wood placed Pounds 8.3m worth of convertible preference shares
with 13 institutions, most of them Scottish.
That doubled the proportion of the group owned by institutions to 18 per
cent, and reduced the stake of the Wood family to 73 per cent.
Mr Wood said yesterday that the group would not be interested in a public
flotation for about four years.
However, he did not rule out the possibility of obtaining a stock exchange
listing through the acquisition of a quoted company.
