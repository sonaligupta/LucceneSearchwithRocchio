FT  28 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Poland likely to import more as
crop tumbles


   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI

POLAND IS likely to turn to world grain markets next year for additional
wheat in the wake of a harvest that could fall to 21.2m tonnes, nearly a
quarter down on last year's 27.8m tonne yield.
The low result predicted for this year by the Central Statistical Office
follows a serious drought in May and June. There has also been a big decline
in fertiliser usage and a 4.6 per cent fall in the area of land sown with
grain this year.
The resulting purchases abroad could be between 1m and 2m tonnes of wheat
and maize. Last year Poland imported a mere 100,000 tonnes of grain compared
to the 2m to 3m traditionally imported in the 1980s and a record 8m tonne
worth of purchases abroad in 1979.
This time Poland can be expected to turn to the European Community, on which
Poland imposes a 10 per cent grain import tariff compared to a 20 per cent
duty on grain brought in from elsewhere. Polish grain traders, led by
Rolimpex, the largest potential purchaser, caution, however, that this
year's harvest could be as high as 24m tonnes.
