FT  27 JAN 94 / Mills defends CPS on abandoned cases


   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent


Nearly half of all cases dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service are
discontinued because there is not sufficient evidence for there to be a
realistic prospect of conviction, Mrs Barbara Mills, director of public
prosecutions, said yesterday.
Announcing the results of a survey of the 10,782 cases discontinued in
November, undertaken after concern about the number of cases dropped, Mrs
Mills said the findings would help correct the misconception that the CPS
was responsible for stopping an increasing number of prosecutions.
Appearing before the Commons home affairs committee, Mrs Mills told MPs some
of the results of the survey might appear surprising.
In 25 per cent of cases the CPS had no option but to discontinue. Where a
witness was missing or refused to give evidence, where the offence had been
taken into consideration by another court, or where defendants charged with
failure to produce motoring documents produced them at court, there was no
choice, she said.
The perception that the CPS was dropping serious cases was also untrue, she
said. More than 40 per cent of the discontinued cases were motoring
offences. In 31 per cent of cases it had been decided that it was not in the
public interest to prosecute. The main public interest reasons for
discontinuing were: defendant convicted/sentenced on other matters (9 per
cent); nominal penalty likely (6 per cent); staleness of case (4 per cent);
and change in complainant's attitude (3 per cent).
Of the 43 per cent of cases discontinued because there was insufficient
evidence, 11 per cent were dropped because of insufficient identification
evidence, in 13 per cent of cases there was an essential legal element
missing and in 19 per cent there was insufficient other evidence.
Mrs Mills denied there was a serious breakdown in relations between the
police and the CPS over how to bring a successful prosecution.
