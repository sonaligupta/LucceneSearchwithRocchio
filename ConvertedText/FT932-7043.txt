FT  26 MAY 93 / Law firm rejects dismissal allegation


A SENIOR partner of a law firm yesterday denied at an industrial tribunal
that there had been a conspiracy to dismiss a male manager who supported a
female colleague's claim of sexual harassment.
The former senior property services manager of Caesar and Howie, based at
Bathgate, near Edinburgh, was dismissed for assaulting another employee and
failing to pay proper attention to business, Mr Robert Shaw, senior partner,
told the Edinburgh tribunal.
Mr Stuart Smith, whose case is funded by the Equal Opportunities Commission,
alleges he was sacked after agreeing to act as a witness for a woman who
took the firm to a tribunal for sexual harassment.
The harassment allegations concerned a senior manager in the property
department and were alleged to have gone on for two or three years. That
case was settled out of court.
Another partner, Mr Kenneth Hogg, giving evidence at the tribunal, admitted
that 'from time to time the property department and people within it ran it
like a sergeants' mess'. On being questioned about what he meant, he said it
was 'all boys together'.
Mr Hogg told the tribunal that the young woman had been dismissed for theft.
The first allegations of sexual harassment came, he said, when the woman
concerned began her action against the firm.
The hearing continues.
