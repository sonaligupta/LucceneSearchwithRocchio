FT  29 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Firm NY start helps Paris to
end at 1992 high


   By Our Markets Staff


LATE-CLOSING bourses improved on Wall Street's opening yesterday, but there
were also strong individual influences to be absorbed, writes Our Markets
Staff.
PARIS ended at its highest level so far this year, lifted by Wall Street's
firm start and further evidence that 1991 corporate results were better than
analysts' worst fears. The CAC 40 index ended 21.33 or 1.14 per cent higher
at 1,890.60. Turnover was estimated at FFr2.7bn, of which around FFr500m was
generated by the insurer, Axa. Dealers said that a block of at least 460,000
shares in Axa was crossed via Axa's broker Meeschaert, but there were no
further details of the transaction. The stock rose FFr8 to FFr932 with
521,560 shares traded.
The most active stock yesterday was Euro Disney, which jumped FFr3 to
FFr149.50 in 531,000 shares after Walt Disney reported better-than-expected
first quarter results.
The food giant BSN fell as low as FFr1,053 in early trading on news that the
Agnelli family had reduced its share of the voting rights in BSN to below 5
per cent. The stock recovered to close FFr4 down at FFr1,075 and dealers
expect the stock to rise further today in the wake of its pleasing 1991
turnover figures.
MILAN eased in quiet trading ahead as investors waited for Fiat's 1991
preliminary results, due later in the day. The Comit index fell 2.37 to
545.31 in turnover estimated at L95bn after Monday's L87.6bn.
Fiat ordinary shares closed L50 down at L5,120, but rebounded on the kerb to
L5,170. After the close Fiat reported a 70 per cent drop in consolidated
operating profit to L636bn. Analysts agreed that the results appeared to be
much worse than expectations but they were reluctant to make any further
comments until the company published more details.
ZURICH heard after hours that Moody's, the ratings agency, was downgrading
Credit Suisse long-term debt and putting Swiss Bank Corp, still AAA-rated,
on its watchlist. CS Holding, parent of Credit Suisse, was unchanged on the
session, but its bearers fell SFr20 to SFr1,910 in London after hours,
following a SFr20 drop on Monday.
SBC bearers closed SFr2 lower at SFr311 for a two-day fall of SFr6m and then
lost another SFr6 in London post-bourse trading. Dealers said it came under
slight pressure on news it had Dollars 130m of exposure to the US retailer
Macy, which on Monday filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. SBC said
Dollars 20m of its commitments to Macy were unsecured.
The all-share SPI index eased eased 1.8 to 1,118.7.
FRANKFURT started well in the pre-bourse, consolidated in the official
session and was mildly excited after hours by news that Deutsche Bank was
raising its dividend from DM14 to DM15.
After a 1.62 decline to 682.58 in the FAZ index at midsession, the DAX
closed just 0.52 lower at 1,683.08, in German market turnover of DM5.9bn
after Monday's DM6.1bn.
Blue chips turned mixed after some early support, Daimler holding on to its
gains to close DM7.20 higher at DM751.70 on the hope that the US tax on
luxury cars might be repealed or reduced. Deutsche eased DM2 to DM704.50
before a late rise to DM707.70 on the dividend news.
STOCKHOLM fell as it waited for the government to reject the proposed merger
between Volvo and Procordia. The Affarsvarlden General index fell 4.0 to
983.3, and Volvo B by SKr8 to SKr390; but Procordia, which had fallen SKr18
in two days, closed unchanged at SKr198.
AMSTERDAM concentrated on Nedlloyd. The CBS Tendency Index rose 0.5 to
122.0. The transport group confirmed that it was finally offering the
Norwegian investor Mr Torstein Hagen, who has a 27 per cent stake in the
company, a seat on the supervisory board. Nedlloyd rose Fl 2.20 or 3.8 per
cent to Fl 59.90 on high volume of 280,000 shares. Internatio-Mueller, the
technology and transport group, rose Fl 3.50 to Fl 63.00 on volume of
130,000 shares. There were reports that it may sell its 44 per cent stake in
the Rotterdam stevedore ECT, in which Nedlloyd holds a similar share.
MADRID rose slightly, with the general index up 1.65 to 255.06. Telefonica,
which announced an unchanged interim dividend on Monday, put on Pta5 to
Pta1,185, with the impetus coming after New York opened.
The banking sector was generally strong: BBV announced flat operating
profits, in line with expectations, and the stock rose Pta30 to Pta2,765;
Popular climbed Pta180 to Pta11,720. Repsol recorded the largest volume,
above 450,000 shares,but fell Pta20 to Pta2,955 on profit-taking.
OSLO saw Elkem rise to NKr76 on speculation of a merger, later denied, with
Norsk Hydro. It fell back to close NKr1.50 higher at NKr72 in turnover of
NKr54m. Norsk Hydro closed unchanged at NKr151 and the all-share fell 3.14
to 449.86.
VIENNA saw an improvement in turnover as the all-share index rose by 5.76 to
446.80.
