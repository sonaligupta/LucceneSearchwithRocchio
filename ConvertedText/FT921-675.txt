FT  27 MAR 92 / Venture capital fund is launched


   By CHARLES BATCHELOR


THE WEST YORKSHIRE Superannuation Fund and County NatWest Ventures yesterday
launched a venture capital fund, Yorkshire Investors, which will have Pounds
30m available for investments, Charles Batchelor writes.
West Yorkshire is one of the largest local-authority pension funds in the
UK. It will be the sole investor in Yorkshire Investors with Pounds 15m
committed, but County NatWest, which will select the investments, will
co-invest on equal terms in each deal, taking the total funds available to
Pounds 30m.
West Yorkshire has assets of Pounds 1.9bn, but it has very little money
invested in venture capital. This is the first time County NatWest has
managed funds for an outside organisation. Local-authority pension funds
have increased investments by 51 per cent to Pounds 271m over the past two
years.
