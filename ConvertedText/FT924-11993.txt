FT  22 OCT 92 / International Company News: Hutchison seeks new UK telecom
partner


   By SIMON DAVIES


   HONG KONG


HUTCHISON Whampoa is attempting to find a new partner for its UK
telecommunications subsidiary as British Aerospace has indicated a desire to
sell its 35 per cent stake in the company.
But Mr Simon Murray, Hutchison managing director, was adamant yesterday his
company's stake would not be sold.
He said Hutchison would withdraw from an aggressive push for new cellular
telephone licences beyond its core markets, reflecting concerns over its
expansion into telecommunications. But Mr Murray said the company was
proceeding with its multi-billion dollar expenditure into the UK.
Hutchison, Hong Kong's most rumour-plagued company, was hit by another wave
of market speculation yesterday over reports that it is to dispose of all
its non-Hong Kong telecommunications operations.
Mr Murray said that some smaller loss-making operations had been shut, but
there was to be no large-scale retrenchment. The company's HKDollars 7bn
(Dollars 903m)personal communications network would be completed by early
1994 and he was optimistic it would be profitable by 1996.
'Hutchison Telecommunications is doing very well overall. It will make more
this year than it did last year,' said Mr Murray, who was confident that the
freeze on new projects would ensure this side of business remained on track.
The continued under-performance of its shares suggests investors remain
unconvinced.
