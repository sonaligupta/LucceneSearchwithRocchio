FUJIAN Enterprises, the Hong Kong-based conglomerate, has purchased 10 per
cent of Allied Group, a company under investigation by the Hong Kong
government for its share dealings.
Fujian Enterprises, which paid HKDollars 126.5m (USDollars 16.4m) for the
230m shares in Allied, is owned by the provincial government of Fujian, a
province located on the south coast of China.
The company acquired the shares from the family trust of Mr Lee Ming Tee,
the chairman of Allied Group. His trust subscribed for 230m shares to
rebuild his holding.
Mr Zhou Huiyuan, chairman of Fujian Enterprises, said his company would
consider acquiring a further 10 per cent of Allied Group.
The investigation into Allied Group and four other companies associated with
Mr Lee is expected to take about six months.
Allied Group has investments in Fujian in a shrimp feedmill and an eel
processing plant.
It also is the developer of a golf course in the province.
