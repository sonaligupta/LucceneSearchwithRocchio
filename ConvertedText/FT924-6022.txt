FT  24 NOV 92 / Growth in rural poor put at 40%


   By REUTER at the United Nations


THE NUMBER of rural poor in developing countries has risen 40 per cent over
the past 20 years, an indication of failure among international aid
programmes, according to a study released yesterday by the Rome-based
International Fund for Agricultural Development (Ifad), Reuter reports from
the United Nations.
The report, covering 114 nations with large rural populations, said the
trickle-down theory of economics and attitudes towards the poor prevented
them from being integrated into a country's economic structure. Ifad, a UN
agency, said most programmes were too heavy on capital investment.
'Development is not something that happens in spite of the poor. It is
something that happens because of them.
'Societies will not need massive infusions of foreign aid as farmers will
generate their own savings and invest them in local production.'
The rural poor were poor because they had been denied resources available to
others - land, credit, technology and social services.
