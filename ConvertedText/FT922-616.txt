FT  26 JUN 92 / Havel calls for quick decision


   By REUTER


   PRAGUE


CZECHOSLOVAK President Vaclav Havel urged his country yesterday to make a
quick decision on whether to break up the federation, saying all citizens
would suffer if political paralysis continued, Reuter reports from Prague.
'Every single day of postponement only increases the unfortunate affects of
uncertainty - moral, economic, international and legal,' he told MPs. 'The
death agony of the common state, its gradual disintegration or a wild
break-up would only turn against all our citizens.'
