FT  30 JUN 93 / China should use death penalty less, delegation says


China should apply the death penalty more sparingly, end public executions,
and introduce further reforms to improve human rights, says the report of a
delegation to China last December led by Lord Howe, the former British
foreign secretary.
The delegation found evidence of continuing violations of human rights. Its
report calls for an 'urgent review of all summary forms of administrative
detention, with a view to their early abolition'.
It urges an end to the practice of holding elderly clergy in prison or
detention centres because their beliefs are 'repugnant' to the Chinese
authorities.
It calls for a reduction in the number of offences which carry the death
penalty and says prisoners should not be paraded before execution. Also, the
use of organs from executed prisoners for spare part surgery should stop, it
says.
