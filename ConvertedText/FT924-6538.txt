FT  20 NOV 92 / Technology: Health, safety and the environment


   By DELLA BRADSHAW


Next week is the UK's National Health, Safety and Environment week, and with
that in mind many companies might be considering how to improve their safety
record. One aid could be a software package developed by Datas, of Enfield,
north London, to help companies analyse where accidents occur and so help to
minimise them.
The Accidata accident management system helps employers comply with the law
by providing the forms on screen that employers need for reporting
accidents. By analysing the data, companies can work out how to prevent
accidents in the future. Datas: 081 366 5557.
