FT  16 MAR 94 / International Company News: Earnings at Generale de Banque
up 8% for year


   By GILLIAN TETT

Consolidated profits at Generale de Banque, Belgium's largest bank, rose by
8 per cent last year to BFr11.6bn (Dollars 333m), up from BFr10.7bn in the
previous 12 months.
Mr Ferdinand Chaffart, chief executive, yesterday claimed that all the
branches of the bank's activities had contributed to the growth, which was
broadly in line with market expectations.
However, he noted that the bank had benefited in particular from falling
interest rates which had boosted financial markets and stock exchanges.
In spite of an overall drop in loans, private sector lending rose by 4.5 per
cent last year. Meanwhile, gross income had risen by 14 per cent as a result
of an expansion of the group's investment funds and foreign exchange
activities, coupled with the realisation of capital gains on government
bonds and the bank's recent sale of its stake in ABN-Amro, Mr Chaffart
added.
The board of directors has proposed an increase in net dividend to BFr340
from BFr320. With the bank hoping to benefit further from a weak D-Mark, in
spite of uncertainties about the scope for further German rate cuts, Mr
Chaffart said he remained 'optimistic' about the prospects for further
growth next year.
