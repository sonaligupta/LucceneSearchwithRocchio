FT  26 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Price increases behind rise at Yorkshire
Water


   By ANGUS FOSTER


YORKSHIRE Water yesterday announced an 8.6 per cent rise in profits and said
its non-regulated, or enterprise, business performed well.
Pre-tax profits advanced from Pounds 114.1m to Pounds 123.9m in the year to
March 31, in line with expectations. The rise was mainly due to average
price rises of 13 per cent, although increased borrowings for capital
expenditure led to an interest charge for the first time.
Turnover was up 13.4 per cent to Pounds 441.2m. This follows a 13.7 per cent
increase to Pounds 219.5m at the interim stage, when profits were 11.7 per
cent higher at Pounds 64.1m.
Turnover in the core water and sewerage business increased by 12 per cent to
Pounds 428.2m. Enterprise businesses, which include the environmental and
property arms, doubled sales to Pounds 13m and generated profits after
financing costs of Pounds 2m.
Operating expenses increased 11.8 per cent and included a
larger-than-expected Pounds 5.5m provision for a land slip at a sewage
treatment works near Huddersfield.
There were also Pounds 4m of reorganisation provisions, Pounds 2m for
additional water pumping to areas of low supply and Pounds 300,000 of
compensation for customers affected by a potential cryptosporidiosis
outbreak in Sheffield.
Capital expenditure in the regulated business increased 16 per cent to
Pounds 290m. Depreciation rose 4.4 per cent to Pounds 44.4m while
infrastructure renewals were up 8.3 per cent to Pounds 66.5m.
Earnings improved by 10.3 per cent to 57.6p (52.2p). A final dividend of 13p
(11.8p) makes a total of 19.5p (17.7p), a 10.2 per cent increase.
COMMENT
Who said water companies are risk free? Despite the predictability of profit
and price increases, Yorkshire's results show how a land slip and other
problems can dent profits, even if the numbers are relatively small.
Although core business results were as expected, there were encouraging
signs from the non-core side. This year should be even better, benefiting
from perhaps Pounds 1m of property profits for the first time, although
unregulated profits are still some way from 10 per cent of the total.
Forecast profits for this year of Pounds 141m put the shares on a multiple
of 7 times, following yesterday's 7p rise to 462p. Given the company's
regulator-friendly image, the shares could go higher as dust from the water
companies' reporting season begins to settle.
