MITSUBISHI Kasei, Japan's leading chemical maker, unveiled a 53.4 per cent
plunge in pre-tax profit to Y13.3bn (Dollars 102m) and a 5.6 per cent drop
in sales to Y727.2bn for the year to March 1992.
Net profit also fell sharply, by 71.2 per cent to Y5.3bn.
The weak performance was the result of falling demand for petrochemicals and
coke in the car, electric machinery, steel and other industries as the
domestic economy slowed.
Sales of coke fell on weak domestic and overseas demand and the phasing out
of the fuel by steelmakers as they introduce more sophisticated furnaces,
Mitsubishi Kasei added.
Demand for carbon black used with rubber remained steady, but synthetic
rubber sales fell, while turnover of ammonia products increased.
Overall, petrochemical sales were down 9.5 per cent to Y271.6bn and carbon
products 7.9 per cent to Y203bn. The company's export sales slipped 0.5 per
cent to Y89.4bn, accounting for 12.2 per cent of the total.
Mitsubishi Kasei reduced cash and savings deposits 23 per cent to Y71.6bn,
while short-term borrowings shot up from Y190m to Y6.6bn. The value of its
securities portfolio declined 8 per cent to Y98.9bn.
Mitsubishi Kasei expects sales to decline marginally for the year to March
1993 to Y770bn. Although pre-tax profits are seen gaining 5.4 per cent to
Y14bn, net profits are forecast to fall 62 per cent to Y7bn.
