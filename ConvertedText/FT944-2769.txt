FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Mid-States postpones ADS placing


Mid-States, the US motor parts distributor quoted on the USM, is proceeding
with its application to be traded on Nasdaq in the form of American
Depositary Shares but has deferred its proposed placing.
Mid-States had planned to raise Dollars 15m (Pounds 9.1m) through a placing
of ADSs at between Dollars 9 and Dollars 11 an ADS (equivalent to between
72p and 80p per ordinary share), but has been advised to postpone it because
of adverse market conditions.
The directors are unwilling to complete the issue at a price below 72p
because of the dilution this would cause for existing shareholders. However,
they may issue a small number of shares at a discount in order to obtain a
Nasdaq quote.
