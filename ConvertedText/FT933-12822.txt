FT  22 JUL 93 / Letters To The Editor: Defence budgets should fund
peacekeeping


   From Professor RONALD DORE


Sir, In all the recent discussion of the restructuring of the United Nations
 -including Edward Mortimer's perceptive piece 'Limits of world order' (July
21) - one constant theme is the shoestring financing of peacekeeping
operations.
But I see no mention of one particular and important item in the proposals
of Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, of last July - his Agenda
for Peace document. It was a simple one; would member states please shift
their funds for UN peacekeeping from their foreign office to their defence
ministry budget. It is, after all, rational functional budgeting. The UN and
national forces are alternative means to the end of national security.
It makes sense in other ways. Defence budgets are universally bigger.
Defence chiefs get committed at the budgeting stage to operations which they
might be called on to carry out. And the chances will be increased of
shifting from contingency to regular financing, thereby making possible the
creation of permanent UN command structures which can prevent the sort of
muddled mismanagement - and waste of resources and lives - that has vitiated
the Somalia operation.
