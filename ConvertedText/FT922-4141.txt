FT  06 JUN 92 / Maxwell associate may hold key post


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


MR MICHAEL STONEY, a close associate of Mr Kevin and Mr Ian Maxwell, is
believed to have been appointed to the board of Sphere, the Californian
video games company which is still part of the Maxwell empire.
The late Robert Maxwell bought an 80 per cent stake in Sphere, which trades
as Spectrum Holobyte, in 1987. The company, which expects turnover of
Dollars 20m this year, is ultimately controlled through the Maxwell
Charitable Foundation in Liechtenstein.
Arthur Andersen, the administrators, started legal action in the US last
month seeking access to the Liechtenstein interests.
Two months ago lawyers for the foundation asked Mr Gilman Louie, Sphere's
founder, to appoint Mr Stoney to the board. Ms Christine Maxwell is a
director of the company and Mr Kevin Maxwell was a director until recently.
Because Mr Louie holds only about 11 per cent of the company he is outvoted.
He assumes the appointment of Mr Stoney has gone ahead.
Sphere's board has not met since 1989.
Mr Stoney is former deputy managing director of AGB International, the
former Maxwell market research company, and former deputy managing director
(finance) of Mirror Group Newspapers.
An office has been prepared for Mr Stoney in a London building rented by
Sphere Inc at 2 Wardrobe Place off Ludgate Hill.
With the Maxwell brothers, Mr Stoney refused to answer questions from a
House of Commons select committee on pensions this year.
Investigators fear that the Maxwell brothers intend trying to relaunch a
business career using Sphere at least in part as a vehicle.
Mr Louie is now exploring ways of trying to buy a majority stake in the
company with the help of venture capital funds. If that proves impossible,
the key people may simply quit, leaving a shell behind, and start a new
video games company.
