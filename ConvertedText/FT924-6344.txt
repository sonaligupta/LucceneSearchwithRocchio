FT  21 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Farm subsidy accord boost for
Dow

Wall Street
US SHARES rose across the board, lifted by news that a trade war with Europe
may have been avoided. Trading was exceptionally heavy because of the
monthly expiration of options contracts, writes Patrick Harverson in New
York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 17.83 at 3,227.36, not
far off its high for the day. The more broadly based Standard & Poor's 500
also ended notably firmer, up 3.04 at 426.65, while the Amex composite put
on 2.85 at 392.19. The Nasdaq composite firmed 4.04 to 642.61, nearing its
all-time high of 644.92 in February.
Turnover on the NYSE was extremely high at 258m shares, while rises outpaced
declines by 1,086 to 699.
After posting only modest gains in the first two hours of trading, stocks
began to climb higher as news came out of Brussels that the EC and the US
had reached an agreement to cut farm subsidies which would clear the way for
a conclusion to the Uruguay Round of Gatt trade talks.
The news that the EC-US talks had been successful was welcomed by investors,
who had feared that a combination of a weak domestic economy, even weaker
European mar kets and a damaging trade war, could wreak havoc on the world
economy. Later reports that the French agriculture minister had said France
had not yet accepted the new accord failed to dampen enthusiasm.
Prices were also affected by the monthly expiration of options on stock
indices and individual stocks. Motor stocks were one of the beneficiaries of
options-related trading. Ford rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 40 1/4 , Chrysler
put on Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 29 and General Motors climbed Dollars  5/8 to
Dollars 31. Both Chrysler and GM confirmed that they had temporarily shut
down a total of six assembly lines because of slow sales.
Monsanto rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 56 1/2 after the chemicals group
announced that it was initiating a series of cost-cutting measures which
would leave the company with an after-tax charge in the fourth quarter of
Dollars 425m. Monsanto hopes to realise savings of about Dollars 200m a year
from 1994 onwards.
Damon Corp rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 22 1/8 on speculation that the
financier Mr Ron Perelman and a European drug company had approached Damon
about a merger or acquisition.
On an otherwise mostly buoyant Nasdaq market, Dell Computer, which posted
strong gains on Thursday following its earnings release, slumped Dollars 3
3/4 to Dollars 34 5/8 amid concern about currency hedging by the personal
computer company. Dell denied reports that the Securities and Exchange
Commission was investigating the currency hedging.
Canada
TORONTO share prices ended the week on a positive note, posting a solid gain
in continued active trading.
Based on preliminary data, the TSE-300 index gained 30.13 points, or 0.93
per cent, to 3,263.86, for a drop on the week of about 5.5 points. Winning
issues led losers by 323 to 273. Trading volume of 37.701m shares was down
slightly from Thursday's 38.938m shares, while value of trading was CDollars
422.3m against CDollars 325.1m.
