FT  27 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pepper production forecast to
plunge this year


   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES


World pepper production is set to plunge this year with an estimated
103,000m tonnes of exports available compared with 164,000m tonnes last year
according to a report by Man Producten, an Amsterdam trader.
The shortfall in output led to a steep rise in prices last year and although
the market has since undergone a correction, it remains strong. Lack of
investment in old and less productive pepper plantations and farmers' lack
of interest in growing pepper following a period of low prices in the late
1980s has seen a substantial decline in the availability of pepper
worldwide.
World pepper demand cannot be met by new crop supplies, but must be
partially satisfied by selling stocks, the report states. There was a large
drawdown of stocks last year and stocks are expected to fall further this
year. Man Producten expects this year's demand to be close to consumption of
between 145,000m tonnes and 155,000m tonnes.
Traders expect a long-term increase in pepper prices, which are at present
about Dollars 2,950 a tonne for white in Rotterdam and 73 cents a pound for
black in New York. The white pepper price soared to touch Dollars 4,100 a
tonne in September from Dollars 1,100 a year before. Black pepper also
increased from historic lows with the New York price doubling to 81 cents a
pound in September.
