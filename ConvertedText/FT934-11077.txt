FT  02 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: India backs sugar re-export
plan - The country's proposals for retaining credibility as a supplier and,
below, on moves to let coffee growers sell their crop abroad


   By KUNAL BOSE


THE INDIAN federal government is favourably disposed to a proposal by the
Indian Sugar and General Industry Exim Corporation to import raw sugar this
season for re-export, after processing, as white sugar.
The corporation has suggested the export-linked import of 250,000 tonnes of
raw sugar during the 1993-94 season. India, which re-entered the sugar
export market in 1990-91 after a gap of six years, will not have any
exportable surplus in the current season.
The initial sugar production forecast for 1993-94 is 11m tonnes, compared
with actual production of 10.6m tonnes last season and 13.4m tonnes in
1991-92. In spite of last year's serious setback in production, India could
export 411,000 tonnes of sugar as the 1992-93 season opened with very
comfortable stocks of over 4.9m tonnes. Indian exports in 1991-92 were
562,000 tonnes, up from 223,000 tonnes in 1990-91.
The Exim corporation has also recommended the import of another 550,000
tonnes of raw sugar in the current season to be refined for domestic
consumption. These import would be made on condition that the same amount
was exported in the following season, when production is expected to
improve.
The Indian Sugar Mills Association has warned the government that India will
lose 'credibility as a dependable source of supply' if it suspends export in
the current season. 'The now on, now off approach to export has not helped
us in the past,' an ISMA official said recently. 'We have made a
considerable effort to develop a market for Indian sugar in the neighbouring
countries. This we do not want to lose.'
Moreover, importing raw sugar for processing into white sugar would enable
the Indian industry to use capacity that would otherwise remain idle.
In the meantime, the mills association has taken strong exception to a
government move to liquidate the buffer stock of 500,000 tonnes of sugar
created six months ago. It argues that not only should the buffer be
maintained but its size should be expanded whenever there is an opportunity
to ensure regularity of export, irrespective of variations in domestic sugar
production.
According to ISMA, Indian sugar production will once again be low as the
area under cane has not increased. What it finds most disturbing is that the
area under cane in Maharashtra, India's most productive cane growing state,
has shrunk, while 'the condition of the crop in the drought affected
Maharashtra is far from satisfactory'. Floods have affected the standing
crop in Bihar and a few other places.
Total supply of sugar in the current season, which opened with stocks of
3.2m tonnes, will be 14.2m tonnes at most. As domestic consumption will be
more than 12m tonnes, compared with 11.9m tonnes last year, the next sugar
season is likely to open with disturbingly low stocks.
