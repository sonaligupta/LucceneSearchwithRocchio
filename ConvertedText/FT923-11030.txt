FT  27 JUL 92 / Observer: Great minds whatalike?


Readers will no doubt know the old Forces saying: 'Once is happenstance,
twice is coincidence, and three times is enemy action.' While that's fine as
far as it goes, however, what on earth is 607 times?
The question is raised by the response to the problem Observer posed last
Tuesday, about why the small cowboy was grateful when, instead of handing
him the glass of water he'd requested, the giant bartender drew a gun and
fired into the air.
It was tackled by 654 people from 23 countries besides the UK, including a
man from El Paso claiming to be the small cowboy in the case - a claim
which, since he's evidently 5'10' tall and has the scarcely western name of
Keith Pannell, is being taken with a pinch of salt.
Further occupations ranged from an ambassador and an archdeacon, through an
avalanche of chief and other executives as well as their spouses and
offspring, to the secretary general of the International Federation of
Tiddly Winks Associations (no kidding]).
The oddest thing was that, although several of the 654 pointed out that such
lateral thinking problems can have many different answers, no fewer than 607
all hit on the same one. It's that, until the gunshot served as
shock-therapy, the small cowboy had been suffering from hiccoughs. And as
the other suggestions, albeit ingenious, seem less plausible, the prize of a
bottle of malt goes to the first of the 607 out of the hat: Stephen Allen of
Britannia Airways.
But that still left Observer wondering how more than nine in every 10
entrants hit on an identical solution - until the latish arrival of an entry
from a certain Paul Sloane. Yet another opting for hiccoughs as the answer,
he adds: 'It appears in my book Lateral Thinking Puzzlers published in 1991
by Sterling in the US and by Cassell in the UK.'
Great minds think alike, my foot]
