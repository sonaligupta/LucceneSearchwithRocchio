FT  09 JAN 92 / Warning of harm to city centres


   By ANDREW JACK


TRENDS IN retail development will destroy the central business districts in
British cities unless there is greater government intervention, the
conference was told yesterday, Andrew Jack writes.
Mr Gwyn Rowley from Sheffield University claimed that shopping complexes
outside town centres are draining money from high streets and reducing the
number of shops that open in them.
Research in 12 towns showed that retail sales in central areas had declined
over the past year as a result of the recession. But sales had fallen by
about 20 per cent in towns with out-of-centre shopping developments, against
a decline of about 10 per cent in other towns. He said plans for a further
500,000 sq ft of out-of-town shopping developments in England and Wales
would accelerate this trend.
Slack planning controls and the limited resources of local authorities have
allowed many new shopping centres to be built, he said.
Other academics at the same session disagreed. Mr Clifford Guy from Cardiff
University said that since the 1970s, the centre of Charlotte, North
Carolina, had shrunk to 'almost complete insignificance' while Cardiff had
grown into an important regional centre. City centres in the UK are still
regarded as the prime location for large shopping developments, he argued.
