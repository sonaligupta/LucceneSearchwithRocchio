FT  12 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Crackdown plan on terror funds


THE government is planning to widen current laws governing money laundering
as part of an attempted crackdown on IRA fundraising.
The proposals - expected to be incorporated before the summer into the
Criminal Justice Bill - would create new offences, including a failure to
report knowledge or suspicion of the existence of laundered terrorist funds,
which will carry a maximum prison sentence of five years.
