ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the Swedish-Swiss engineering group, reported pre-tax
profit down 3 per cent in the first quarter, to Dollars 225m. It said it had
not yet experienced an upturn in any industrialised markets.
Orders received reached Dollars 7.8bn, 1 per cent higher than in the first
quarter of 1991. Revenues were up 2 per cent to Dollars 6.5bn, and operating
earnings were 4 per cent higher at Dollars 407m. Pre-tax profit after
non-recurring items was down 9 per cent at Dollars 222m.
The group said its infrastructure-related businesses, such as power plants
and power transmission, had higher earnings. However, its
power-distribution, industrial and environmental-controls divisions - which
are related to construction and capital spending - reported weaker results.
Demand in Asian markets remained strong, with the group winning large power
plant orders in India and Indonesia since the beginning of the year.
