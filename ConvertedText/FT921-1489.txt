2.71bn (USDollars 1bn) in 1991, a rise of 21.4 per cent from 1990. Premium
receipts grew 21.3 per cent, the country's director-general of insurance
said in his 1991 report, Reuter reports from Kuala Lumpur.
Investment income rose 21.1 per cent and income from other sources by 23.8
per cent. New sums insured for life insurance in grew 5.8 per cent in 1991
to MDollars 26.12bn, against 16 per cent growth in 1990.
The slower growth for sums insured was due to a sharp fall in temporary
policies, to 3.9 per cent in 1990 from 25.3 per cent in 1990. The number of
new policies issued and new annual premiums rose sharply by 24.8 per cent
and 26.8 per cent respectively in 1991, from 5.7 per cent and 19.9 per cent.
Premium receipts accounted for 73.4 per cent of total income. Total
expenditure incurred by the industry rose 19.8 per cent in 1991 to MDollars
1.47bn.
