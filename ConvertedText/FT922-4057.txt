FT  08 JUN 92 / SEBanken makes first loss ever


   By ROBERT TAYLOR


   STOCKHOLM


SKANDINAVISKA Enskilda Banken (SEBanken), Sweden's largest private
commercial bank, has reported an operating loss of around SKr600m (Pounds
57m) after bad debt provisions for the first four months of the year, its
first deficit ever.
The bank said it had decided to make a preliminary statement about its
interim results ahead of their full disclosure tomorrow to counter
speculation about the state of its finances.
The loss follows a jump to SKr2.5bn from an estimated SKr1.6bn in bad debt
provisions. Actual write-offs in the first four months totalled SKr563m.
The bank reported an operating profit of SKr752m for the first four months
of 1991.
There remains little prospect of any early revival, but the bank said its
capital ratio was still above 10 per cent, which put it well within
international requirements. SEBanken's total risk capital amounted to
SKr31.4bn on April 30.
The bank estimates that its total provisions could amount to SKr7.5bn for
the whole of 1992 after reaching a figure of SKr4.76bn last year.
The crisis in Sweden's property market and construction industry have hit
SEB and other Swedish banks badly.
Last week Coronado, the third largest listed property company on the
Stockholm bourse, suspended payments on its outstanding debt of between
SKr3bn and SKr4bn.
Its main bankers are SEBanken and Nordbanken, the Swedish state-owned
loss-making bank that is about to be bought up completely by the government.
Nordbanken last week reported a SKr1.97bn loss for the first four months of
the year.
Mr Bjorn Svedberg, SEBanken's recently appointed chief executive who was
formerly in charge of Ericsson, the big Swedish telecommunications group,
also faces difficulties in reviving morale at the bank.
He is the third person to hold the top post there in less than three years.
Even if the provisions are excluded from the figures, the bank's operating
profit fell 19 per cent in the first four months to SKr1.9bn from SKr2.3bn
for the same period of 1991.
For the whole of last year the group operating profit after provisions fell
30 per cent to SKr2.326bn after provisions.
