FT  11 APR 94 / Company News (This Week): Mishaps unlikely to tarnish
improvement - Gold Fields


The ritual of South African gold mines' quarterly results kicks off tomorrow
with the publication of the latest figures for Gold Fields of South Africa.
After displaying improved results for the first six months, following a
four-year slide in earnings, the company's third-quarter numbers - along
with those of most of the other big mining houses over the next two weeks -
are expected to follow this favourable trend.
Nevertheless, analysts note that Gold Fields has been hampered by recent
mishaps at key mines, including a shaft accident at Kloof and fires at
Driefontein, the country's most profitable gold mine, although they do not
feel this will significantly affect the overall picture.
Offsetting this, the company will have benefited from its aversion to
forward hedging, which has allowed it to take advantage of the improved spot
price for gold, the effects of which have been magnified by a steady decline
of the rand against the dollar.
Overall, the results are likely to be in line with the previous quarter's
after-tax profits of R387.7m (Dollars 110m).
A recent R6m judgment against Gold Fields for unfair dismissals may affect
the results. Longer term, given Gold Fields' traditionally confrontational
labour relations, some analysts are wary of its prospects under a probable
African National Congress government.
