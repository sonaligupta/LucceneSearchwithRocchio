FT  19 MAY 92 / Letter: Bottlenecks avoided


   From Mr MARTYN THOMAS


Sir, Your business air travel survey (May 11) omitted an important and
topical issue. With the completion of the single market in Europe, there
will be a growing need for point-to-point air travel, avoiding the
bottlenecks of big airports. The UK has more than 350 licensed aerodromes
from which private flights can be made, and France has some 1,000 (most of
which are managed by the local Chambers of Commerce, which recognise the
business importance of having an airport). A direct flight from the UK in a
light aircraft is a convenient alternative for business journeys.
In the US, it is said that more business passenger miles are flown in light
aircraft than on scheduled services, which takes much of the pressure off
big airports.
This pattern is likely to develop in the European single market, with
important consequences for airspace policy. If the UK persists in the folly
of maintaining national customs and border controls after they are abandoned
by other European countries in 1993, it shall damage its competitive
position in Europe and miss an opportunity to reduce air and ground
congestion.
