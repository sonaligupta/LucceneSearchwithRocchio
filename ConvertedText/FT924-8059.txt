FT  13 NOV 92 / Bolivia and Peru in trade accord


   By CHRIS PHILIPSBORN


   LA PAZ


Bolivia and Peru have signed a free trade agreement, Chris Philipsborn
reports from La Paz. The treaty marks the tentative first step in Peru's
attempts to restore trading links with its neighbours since it dropped out
of the Andean trade pact in July.
Tariffs on some 6,000 products are to be axed. However, as a concession to
the Peruvian agricultural sector, tariffs of 8 per cent will be maintained
on soya and sunflower oil.
