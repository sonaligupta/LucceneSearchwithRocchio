FT  13 APR 94 / World Trade News: Plea for Lome countries


   By ALISON MAITLAND


The European Union was yesterday urged to rethink its trade policies towards
African, Caribbean and Pacific countries in the Lome convention to help them
cope with losses under the Gatt agreement.
Mr Orlando Marville, chairman of the ACP committee of ambassadors to the EU,
told a conference in London that world trade liberalisation was projected to
cut the value of tropical exports from the 70 ACP countries to the EU by
8-16 per cent.
This was because preferential trading arrangements between the EU and Lome
countries would be eroded by the opening of the European market to
competitors, he told the conference on Gatt and developing countries,
organised by the Catholic Institute for International Relations.
While tropical products represented 44 per cent of overall ACP exports to
the EU, some countries stood to lose particularly because of their
dependence on a single commodity.
Tobacco, for example, accounted for 55 per cent of Malawi's exports, while
Mauritius was 50 per cent dependent on sugar receipts from the EU.
Moreover, the fall in export subsidies under the Gatt deal would push up
prices of cereals, dairy products and meat, which would hit net importers
among the ACP countries.
'The EU shouldn't put up its hands and say 'There's nothing more we can
do',' said Mr Marville. 'The EU can help. The Lome convention has great
potential which has never been exploited.'
The mid-term review of the fourth Lome convention is due to start next
month. Mr Marville urged a transfer of know-how from the EU to help ACP
countries diversify and add value to commodities by processing and marketing
them.
