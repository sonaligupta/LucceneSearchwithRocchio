   By BERNARD SIMON


A stronger gold price and higher investment income helped Placer Dome, the
Vancouver-based gold producer, more than treble first-quarter earnings.
Net earnings were USDollars 37m, or 16 cents a share, up from Dollars 11m,
or 5 cents, a year earlier. The latest figures include a Dollars 6m
after-tax gain from the sale of investments in other mining companies.
Revenues edged up to Dollars 216m from Dollars 213m.
