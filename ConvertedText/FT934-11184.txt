FT  02 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: High earner an asset


   From Mr MICHAEL SPENCER


Sir, Eyebrows may indeed be raised in Downing Street and elsewhere at the
remuneration received by Mr Alamouti, head of arbitrage trading at Tokai
Bank in London ('Arbitrage dealer defies recession to earn Pounds 9m',
October 27). However, before the cynics get into a lather, it is worth
considering what benefits, if any, Mr Alamouti contributes to the British
economy.
First, there is the obvious point that he has highly transportable skills
and could, with a phone and Reuters screen, practise his chosen trade in New
York, Frankfurt, Paris or Tokyo pretty much as easily as he can in London.
The fact that he works here not only helps the City in maintaining its
pre-eminent position in the global financial markets but also benefits the
Exchequer not immaterially. His income tax bill and Tokai's increased
corporation tax liability no doubt add up to a tidy sum.
Second, arbitrage is itself an economically important activity. Without it,
price imperfections and illiquidity would disadvantage market users and make
the process of risk transfer less efficient. As the layers of mystery behind
financial derivatives are stripped away, Mr Alamouti will find increased
knowledge and competition making arbitrage less profitable and the markets
more efficient. But by then, no doubt, he will either have retired or moved
on. In the meantime we need more, not fewer, Alamoutis.
