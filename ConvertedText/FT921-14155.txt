FT  17 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Davenport Vernon down 27%


AN IMPROVED second half enabled Davenport Vernon, the multi-franchise motor
dealer operating from 17 locations, to cut its pre-tax shortfall to 27 per
cent in the year ended September 30 1991.
The profit worked through at Pounds 1.43m (Pounds 1.96m) after being 50 per
cent behind at the halfway mark. Mr Ralph Denne, chairman and managing
director, said the increase in activity was particularly evident between
July and September, and reflected a better level of customer confidence
which continued into the current year.
Although difficult conditions continued, he said 'our experience at
Davenport Vernon is that this recession has not been as severe as those of
1975 and 1981'. Turnover was ahead to Pounds 99.7m (Pounds 94.9m) but
operating profit fell to Pounds 2.54m (Pounds 3.1m). Interest charges took
Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 1.14m).
Earnings per share dropped to 7.3p (10.3p) and the proposed final dividend
is 2.5p for a same-again total of 4p.
