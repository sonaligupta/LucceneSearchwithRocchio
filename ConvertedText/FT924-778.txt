FT  22 DEC 92 / UK Company News: High-Point cuts debt by disposal


High-Point is reducing net debt by Pounds 1.7m through the sale of
Transportation Planning Associates to Oscar Faber.
Consideration is Pounds 950,000 cash and the discharge by Oscar Faber of all
TPA's debts amounting to Pounds 1m. In the year to May 31 TPA incurred a
pre-tax loss of Pounds 391,000.
The sale is in line with the policy of disposing of businesses outside
mainstream activities and follows the sale of Rendel Science & Environment
in October.
Projections show a continued breach of covenants on borrowing facilities,
and the loan facilities are technically repayable on demand.
The board believes that trading for the current year will improve over last
time.
