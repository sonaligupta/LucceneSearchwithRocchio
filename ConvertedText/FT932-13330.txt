FT  23 APR 93 / International Company News: Delta Air trims deficit to
Dollars 133.9m

   NEW YORK


DELTA Air Lines, one of the big three US carriers, yesterday unveiled an
after-tax loss of Dollars 133.9m for the three months to end-March, only
slightly lower than the deficit of Dollars 151.6m in the same period of
1992.
The third-quarter results contained an operating loss of Dollars 178.6m
(Dollars 199.3m).
Contained in the operating and after-tax losses was an Dollars 82.5m
'restructuring charge' related to the decision to return certain Airbus jets
to the lessors and to temporarily lay-off 600 pilots. Excluding this charge,
Delta would have made an operating loss of Dollars 96m, and a net loss of
Dollars 81.7m.
Delta's figures came one day after American Airlines had cheered the entire
US airline sector with better-than-expected first-quarter results, and
hinted that profitability could be in sight.
Delta's result, although showing improvement year-on-year, caused airline
shares generally to weaken. Delta's own stock was down Dollars 1 5/8 at
Dollars 57 5/8 at the close in New York. The stock of AMR, the parent
company of American, initially held its own but fell Dollars 1 1/8 by the
close to stand at Dollars 70 1/8 .
Delta said it regarded the results as 'disappointing', although it noted
they did reflect 'continuing improvements in unit revenues and unit costs'.
Operating revenues rose by 4 per cent year-on-year, to Dollars 2.93bn, while
total operating expenses were Dollars 3.105bn (Dollars 3.014bn).
The third-quarter figures mean Delta is now posting a Dollars 367m loss
after tax for the first nine months, against a Dollars 326.2m deficit at the
same stage in 1992. Nine-month revenues stand at Dollars 8.87bn, compared
with Dollars 8.01bn.
