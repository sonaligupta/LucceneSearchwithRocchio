FT  25 AUG 92 / Banker owns to theft of BFr700m


   By REUTER


   BRUSSELS


A FORMER financial controller of Belgian state bank Credit Communal has
confessed to stealing BFr700m (Pounds 12m) in frauds stretching over more
than 35 years, the Brussels crown prosecutor's office said yesterday,
Reuters reports from Brussels.
Prosecution officials said yesterday that Mr Jacques Labar, 69, was being
held on fraud charges. He had given himself up on Friday, pleading remorse
and inability to pay back loans he had coaxed out of customers with the
promise of high interest rates.
Credit Communal said it had learned Mr Labar had carried out the frauds by
wrongful use of the bank's name and documents and by falsifying the
signature of a bank officer. The money had been spent on housing, cars and
holidays.
Mr Labar retired in 1989 as inspector-general, in effect the bank's top
auditor in charge of fraud prevention, but he stayed on in an advisory
capacity.
