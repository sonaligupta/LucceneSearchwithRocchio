FT  23 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Where to find the guidance you need


Trading options is only for knowledgeable investors with deep pockets. The
problem is that in-depth information is not available as readily as that for
shares.
The London International Financial Futures Exchange (Liffe) has a help-line*
and will provide a starter pack that includes a newsletter, a list of about
50 brokers, a slim guide book, and a programme of seminars which costs
between Pounds 9 and Pounds 12. After that, however, you are out on your
own.
The next stage is to contact a broker although only about a dozen, such as
Killik & Co., give advice on strategy. But Graeme Hatch, the head of
Killik's traded options team, warns that unlike share portfolios, which can
be left in the care of a broker, options are too risky to devolve. 'They are
far too volatile and speculative to leave to a broker, and people should
follow them closely,' he says.
For more confident investors, there are execution-only brokers which will
charge less but provide no specific advice. The most well-known is probably
ShareLink, of Birmingham. ShareLink will send out an information pack
similar to Liffe's and a regular newsletter. After that, it can tell a
client nothing more than the prices and the spreads.
