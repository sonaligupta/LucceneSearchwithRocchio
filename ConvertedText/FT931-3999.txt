FT  12 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Metals prices seen 'drifting'


   By DAVID BLACKWELL


BASE METAL prices will drift near their present depressed levels this year,
Mr Phillip Crowson, chief economist at RTZ, the world's biggest mining
company, predicted yesterday. Speaking at the announcement of RTZ's 1992
results, he said that while the US economy appeared to be on the road to
recovery, the German and Japanese economies were not. Western Europe and
Japan account for roughly half the Western World's consumption of
non-ferrous metals.
'Even with the US recovery gathering momentum, therefore, prices of metals
and mineral are unlikely to depart far from their present trading ranges
until late in the year at best.'
However, he believed the minerals industries were well placed to benefit
when Europe and Japan emerged from recession. 'Prices should react more
quickly to economic recovery than they did in the 1980s, even if that
recovery is sluggish and protracted.'
