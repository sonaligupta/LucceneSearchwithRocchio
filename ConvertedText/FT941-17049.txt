FT  06 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Riva shares tumble 7p on profits warning


Riva Group yesterday saw its shares fall 7p to 18p after the USM-traded
supplier of electronic point of sale systems warned of a substantial loss
for 1993.
The company said that a number of overseas subsidiaries had suffered
disappointing trading results. Consequently, a number of write-downs might
be necessary in some European operations.
UK operations had maintained profitability.
Riva said it had repaid more than Pounds 1m of its UK bank debt and had
renegotiated facilities with its principal lenders on a continuing basis.
Mr Peter Giles has been appointed executive chairman and Mr David Dace will
remain on the board as a non-executive director.
In 1992 the group returned pre-tax profits of Pounds 134,000, but for the
half year to June 30 there was a swing from pre-tax profits of Pounds
314,000 to losses of Pounds 425,000.
