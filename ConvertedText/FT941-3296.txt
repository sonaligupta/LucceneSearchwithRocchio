FT  16 MAR 94 / Survey of Information and Communications Technology (35):
New paging system for Dutch prisons


   By MICHAEL WILTSHIRE


The Dutch group Teletechnicom and the Swindon-based company Blick Telefusion
have won a contract to upgrade potentially life-saving radio-paging systems
installed in Dutch prisons.
Since 1986, the two companies have held the contract to supply radio-paging
systems to 30 of the 45 prisons in Holland. But an unprecedented series of
attacks on prison guards forced the Dutch ministry of justice to put out a
tender for a more sophisticated system to be developed.
Hostage situations have resulted in serious injury and even loss of life.
The new paging system is marketed abroad under the title, Bodyguard.
Location signals can be sent out by the pagers each time a guard passes one
the many location code transmitters installed in prisons buildings.
The pagers also register the last two loctions of the user in case of
emergency and loss of contact. This data is relayed to a computer terminal
programmed to show the location of all guards, using a schematic display of
the prison.
Others features include a 'man down' alarm, triggered by a floating mercury
switch, a silent hostage alert button.
