FT  23 NOV 92 / Protection sought for pensions


A PRIVATE member's bill to protect the pension rights of employees affected
by company takeovers is to be launched today by Mr Andrew Miller, MP for
Ellesmere Port and Neston.
The bill is designed to ensure that employees don't lose out if their
schemes are transferred or wound up and that benefits are maintained after a
takeover.
