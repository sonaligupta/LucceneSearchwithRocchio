   BLANTYRE


A group of former civil servants and politicians have formed a front to
campaign for multi-party democracy in Malawi, according to the official
Malawi News Agency (Mana), Reuter reports from Blantyre.
The United Democratic Front brings together several former top members of
Malawi's sole legal party, the Malawi Congress party, who over the years
have fallen foul of self-declared Life President Kamuzu Banda's unchallenged
rule.
