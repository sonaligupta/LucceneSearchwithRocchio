FT  23 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Design role for road builders


   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent


ALL road schemes worth up to Pounds 40m are to be considered for a new form
of contract making roadbuilders responsible for designing as well as
constructing highways, Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, announced
yesterday.
He said that the design-and-build contracts should ensure greater certainty
over timings and costs of projects.
Up to a third of all contracts would be awarded in this way within three or
four years. They would replace arrangements by which consultants are
commissioned to design a road before the construction contract is put out to
tender.
The move follows successful trials of two schemes, and a further four
schemes, totalling Pounds 118m will also be built under the new contracts.
