FT  17 JAN 92 / Observer: Ivan the voluble


Britain's parliamentary equivalent of TV talent-spotting shows, private
members' bills, offer obscure backbenchers a rare chance to change the law
and achieve stardom. And opportunity knocks today for Conservative MP Ivan
Lawrence, whose national lottery bill comes up in the House of Commons.
He is already better known than most backbenchers, not least because of his
other job as a criminal barrister in which he appeared for the Kray brothers
and serial-murderer Denis Nilsen. But he has also scored a telling
achievement in parliament.
In opposing the Water (Fluoridation) Bill nearly seven years ago, he made a
speech starting at 5 am and lasting four hours 23 minutes - enshrined in the
Guinness Book of Records as the longest backbench speech under present
standing orders.
