FT  05 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: All you ever wanted to . . .


   By RICHARD CHANT and ALAN SUGDEN


This is the first in a series by Richard Chant and Alan Sugden on all
aspects of capital gains tax. The four articles are intended to help private
investors in stock market securities work out their cumulative capital gains
during each tax year, and to describe the steps needed to minimise CGT
liability. These articles are written specifically for the serious stock
market investor although capital gains on other assets, such as second
homes, may also trigger CGT liabilities. Today, we set out the basic rules,
including chargeable gains and allowable losses.
CGT is charged on your capital gain when disposing of an asset, and capital
losses can be set off against capital gains.
They are known as chargeable gains and allowable losses and are the
difference between the net proceeds from disposal (or open market value if
the asset is given away) and the attributable gross cost of the asset when
it was bought (or the open market value if acquired otherwise).
The actual gross cost (or the value at March 31 1982) is indexed to allow
for the increase in the retail price index (RPI) - that is, inflation while
you have held the asset - to give the attributable indexed cost, but only by
the amount of inflation since March 31 1982.
A warning, though: Any calculations you make after reading this article will
need to be adjusted next week to take account of indexation.
Calculation of
chargeable gains
CGT payable on disposals in any tax year (April 6 to the following April 5)
is calculated in steps:
1. Work out the gain or loss on each asset disposed of during the year.
Where the asset is a security that has been bought and sold in the market,
use gross cost (cost plus expenses) and net proceeds (gross proceeds less
expenses).
Note that the date of the contract is the date of purchase or sale, not the
settlement date.
2. Subtract total allowable losses from total chargeable gains. This will
produce either a net allowable loss, which ends the calculation - such a
loss can be carried forward indefinitely to offset future net chargeable
gains; or a net chargeable gain.
3. Each person has an annual exemption, including children. Deduct the
annual exemption (Pounds 5,800 in 1992/93 and 1993/94) from the net
chargeable gain.
If this produces a negative figure or zero, there is no CGT to pay. If the
figure is still positive then:
4. Deduct capital losses brought forward (see below). This will produce
either a negative figure, which is the amount of losses that can be carried
forward to future years (there is no CGT to pay), or a positive figure,
which is the amount of chargeable gain on which CGT will be assessed.
The calculation must be done in the sequence shown. If, for instance, you
make a total of Pounds 5,000 chargeable gains and Pounds 2,000 of allowable
losses, you are not allowed to set the Pounds 5,000 off against your annual
exemption and carry forward the Pounds 2,000 losses to future years.
Net gains would be Pounds 3,000, less than the annual exemption, so there
would be no CGT charge and no losses to carry forward.
Note that none of this includes the process of indexation, and that no
unused annual exemption can be carried forward. The list of investments
exempt from CGT is shown below.
Calculating CGT payable
The tax liability on net chargeable gains (less the annual exemption) is
normally calculated by adding them to taxable income in the tax year and
working out the additional tax due (see box 1).
Investments that are
exempt from CGT
Gains (and losses) on the following investments are excluded from CGT
assessments:
Saye (save as you earn) contracts, but not the shares acquired if linked to
a share option scheme, as is often the case.
Premium Bond winnings.
Government stock (gilts).
Personal equity plans.
Bonuses from tax-exempt special savings accounts (Tessas).
Qualifying corporate bonds (QCBs). These are any debentures, loan stock or
bonds where the debt attaching to them is a normal commercial loan in
sterling and cannot be converted to any other currency.
The rules are not straightforward, though. Gains on QCBs acquired on or
before March 13 1984 are subject to CGT.
Losses on disposal of QCBs held on or issued after March 15 1989 are
allowable for CGT, but the original cost cannot be indexed to calculate
losses.
Offsetting trading losses
against capital gains
Since 1991/92, you have been allowed to set trading losses not covered by
all other income against chargeable gains in either the same or the
following tax year.
If, for example, you are self-employed and making losses over and above all
your other income, the excess losses in any tax year can be set off against
chargeable gains in that year and/or the following year.
Carrying losses forward
If capital losses are more than capital gains made in the same year, the
excess losses in that year can be carried forward indefinitely and offset
against gains in later years. For an example of how this works, see box 2.
Negligible value
The Inland Revenue keeps a list of securities which it deems to be of
negligible value. But the investor does not have to wait until the security
appears on that list before claiming for an allowable loss; he can do that
as soon as he considers that a holding in his portfolio is worthless.
When he does, and the security is not on the Revenue's list, it will
investigate.
If satisfied that the security is worthless, the Revenue will allow the
claim and add the security to its list. This allows later claims from other
holders to be agreed without further investigation.
Each quarter, the Revenue sends out lists of 'deemed' securities to its
local offices, various tax journals and specialist tax services (although
not the press in general) which then pass on this information to their
subscribers.
Twice a year, Extel Financial publishes a slim A4 size book called CGT
Capital Losses. It contains the Revenue's quarterly information plus a list
of companies that have gone into receivership but have not yet had their
shares deemed of negligible value.
The annual subscription is Pounds 53 (Extel Financial, tel: 071-251-3333).
If you want to know if a security is on the Revenue's list, but do not want
to subscribe to a specialist service, ask your local inspector of taxes (who
will have the latest quarterly list), or your accountant or stockbroker
(most of whom take a specialist service).
In the past, some investors have been slow to make claims on securities of
negligible value. There are two possible reasons:
1. They may think, mistakenly, that a security has to appear on the
Revenue's list before they can claim; this, as we have described, is not so.
In fact, if no shareholders ever claimed until a security appeared on the
list, it would never contain any securities: definitely a chicken and egg
situation.
2. They may have wanted to allow the indexed cost of the security to
continue growing with the RPI until they needed to claim the loss to offset
against gains.
This was quite a crafty move, but indexing holdings of negligible value was
ruled out by January 1994's Finance Bill for negligible-value claims made
after November 29 1993 (Budget day). In our view, this is a bit tough.
No CGT on death
When a person dies there is no charge on the net unrealised gains in their
portfolio although their estate is, of course, subject to inheritance tax.
Valuing a dead
person's estate
Securities in the estate are valued using the open-market value of each on
the date of death or, if that was not a working day, on the last day for
which the price was published before death.
The open-market value of a security listed on the London stock exchange,
including the USM, is the lower of:
1. The bid price of the security plus one-quarter of the spread (the
difference between the bid price and the offer price). This is known
colloquially as 'quarter up.'
2. The figure halfway between the highest and the lowest prices of bargains
recorded that day in the stock exchange's Daily Official List.
For foreign securities listed on a recognised stock exchange, the basis for
calculating the value of a disposal is very similar to that for a UK listed
security; the value is converted into sterling at the rate of exchange at
the date of death.
Selling assets from an estate
If securities are sold from an estate within 12 months of death, the
executors can elect that, for the purpose of IHT, the proceeds of the sale
can be substituted for the open market value at the date of death. But the
election has to be for all disposals during that 12 months.
This can be a very important concession if money has to be raised by the
executors and the market is falling.
Filling in your tax return
If your chargeable gains do not exceed the exempt amount for the year
(Pounds 5,800 in 1993/94), and the aggregate value of (or the net
consideration received for) the assets disposed of does not exceed twice the
exempt amount for the year (Pounds 11,600 in 1993/94), there is no need to
provide details of your capital gains and losses in the year (which include
gains and losses on assets other than stock market securities). You just
tick the box provided.
If either of these figures is exceeded, you must give details of each
chargeable asset disposed of, and the amount of chargeable gain. You might
also, if you wish, provide your tax inspector with your computations. The
new version of the annual tax return, form 11P, introduced in 1992/93, gives
a useful pro forma for doing each computation.
Date of payment of CGT
Your return should be sent to your tax office by October 31 following the
end of each tax year. CGT should then be paid by December 1 (or, if later,
by 30 days after the issue of the assessment).

Question.' But we cannot provide detailed advice about personal CGT returns.
Next week: Indexation
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Table 1: CALCULATING CGT PAYABLE
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
In 1993/94 a wife who stays at home to look after her children
estimates that her total income, including tax rebates on her dividend
income, will be pounds2,800.
In 1993/94 the personal allowance is pounds3,445.
Her husband pays tax at the marginal rate of 40 per cent; he claims and
automatically receives the benefit of the married couple's allowance of
pounds1,720, as they have not elected to do otherwise (see footnote).
Her net capital gains so far this year after Indexation (which will be
explained next week) are pounds34,200 - an aunt left her some money and
she put pounds17,500 into British Airways shares at the time of the Gulf
War, taking her profit last month. She has no carried forward losses.
How much CGT will she have to pay, assuming she makes no further
disposals?
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
The calculation:
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Capital gain                                   pounds34,200
Annual exemption                                    (5,800)
Taxable gain                                         28,400
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Unused personal allowances can't be used to offset against capital
gains, so she starts at the bottom of the lowest tax band:
Tax band pounds           Tax rate %     Tax payable pounds
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
0 - 2,500                         20                    500
2,501 - 23,700                    25                  5,300
23,701 - 28,400                   40                  1,880
CGT payable in 1993/94                                7,680
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: Allocation of Married Couple's Allowance. The wife can ask to
receive half the allowance, or they can jointly ask for the wife to
receive it all. If neither of these requests are made, the husband can
claim and automatically receive all the allowance which, in this case,
is clearly to their advantage.
