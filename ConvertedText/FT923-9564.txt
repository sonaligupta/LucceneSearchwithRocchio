FT  04 AUG 92 / Easy target


A minister last night admitted that 'mindless bombings' such as those that
injured 21 people in Belfast early yesterday could not be prevented. Mr
Michael Mates, Ulster security minister, said after visiting the scene of
the double bomb attack, which caused Pounds 3m worth of damage, that it was
'almost impossible to guard against' such activity. The first bomb went off
after an IRA warning. As clearing up was under way, the second exploded
without an alert.
