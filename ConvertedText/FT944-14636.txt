FT  21 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan preoccupied by domestic
events


   By Our Markets Staff


Bourses mostly followed US markets, climbing in the morning on the Dow's
overnight gain, and descending in the afternoon after T-bonds slumped on
inflationary news from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve, writes Our Markets
Staff.
MILAN was distracted by fast moving domestic economic and political
developments, which included the unions' tepid response to the government's
olive branch on pension reform, and the suspension of a parliamentary
sitting after government and opposition deputies came to blows.
The Comit index fell 2.63 to 618.97, after early pressure on Fiat, but the
real time Mibtel index reflected a late technical rally, picking up from a
low of 9,835 to finish 64 up at 9,954.
Mr Michele Pacitti at James Capel suggested that one reason for the market's
recent weakness was that domestic funds, which had invested heavily in
equities during September, were now switching to take advantage of more
attractive yields from bonds.
Fiat, meanwhile, found itself at the centre of a battle between speculators,
trying to talk the market bellwether down to L5,800, and investors anxious
for the price to hold above the psychologically important L6,000. In early
trade, the stock fell to L5,975, its first intraday dip below L6,000 since
late June, before picking up to finish L29 ahead at L6,080.
FRANKFURT offered a variation on the day's theme, opening low on fears that
an SG Warburg presentation would be bearish for equities, and worried by
pressures on Mannesmann and Volkswagen.
It surmounted these, with the Dax recovering 18.79 to 2,069.75 on the
session, and its bond market was resistant to US influences in the
afternoon; but the Ibis-indicated Dax succumbed, closing 9.98 lower on the
day at 2,048.15.
Turnover rose from DM6.6bn to DM7.4bn. The switch from cyclicals to
financials was still on. Deutsche Bank and Bayernhypo rose DM9.60 and
DM5.50, to DM732.80 and DM397.50 respectively; VW and Siemens paid the price
with falls of DM6.70 to DM436.30 and DM14.10 to DM614.90.
Ms Barbara Altmann at B Metzler in Frankfurt said that Mannesmann, in
particular, could have been suffering from US selling as American holders
took profits on the shares, and on the D-Mark. After a two-day fall of DM30,
the stock showed a session gain of DM12.50 to DM385.50.
Meanwhile, another high flyer flew even higher, the computer software group
SAP hitting a new high of DM940, up DM65 or 7.4 per cent on a 194 per cent
jump in nine-month operating profits.
PARIS fell after the release of the US data but then recovered its
equilibrium. The CAC-40 index ended off 8.94 at 1,867.37 after a low of
1,860.
A further setback sent shares of Eurotunnel into a dive as a train due to
take journalists on a demonstration run from London to Paris broke down just
before it was due to leave the station.
A back-up train was later used and Eurotunnel said the journey had been
successfully completed in under the scheduled three hours. The shares, which
had dropped to FFr15.85 early in the session, managed to recoup some of the
loss, closing FFr1.65 off at FFr16.00.
Generale des Eaux slipped FFr8 to FFr446 before it announced after the close
that it expected a 4 per cent gain in full-year profits, after a 5 per cent
rise in first-half data.
Accor shares dipped FFr6 to FFr551 on news that the hotel group expected
next week to report a first-half net loss.
ZURICH saw an early technical rebound run out of steam on worries about
higher interest rates, and the SMI index finished 1.1 ahead at 2,530.9, off
a high of 2,547.6.
UBS bearers fell SFr11 to SFr1,245, with some investors said to be
disillusioned at the prospect of a long battle with BK Vision over the
bank's plan for a single share category.
Pharmaceuticals recouped some of their recent losses. Roche certificates
added SFr25 at SFr5,675, Ciba rose SFr10 to SFr715 and Sandoz put on SFr5 at
SFr647. Among insurers, Swiss Re, finding renewed favour with investors,
picked up SFr10 to SFr740.
MADRID lost early gains to close with the general index down 0.45 at 296.08,
undermined by Wall Street and domestic bond market losses.
TEL AVIV shook off the pessimism that followed Wenesday's bombing of a bus
in the city, and the Mishtanim blue chip index rose 5.56 or 2.9 per cent to
195.25.
Brokers said the underlying sentiment, too, was positive, given that the
market had only fallen by just over 1 per cent on the previous day's events.
