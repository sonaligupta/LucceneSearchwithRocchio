FT  28 SEP 94 / Purchasing index issuing system is reformed


   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff


The controversial system for distributing the Purchasing Managers Index has
been reformed in an attempt to prevent market leaks of price-sensitive
information.
The move comes after mounting accusations from City analysts that the system
for releasing the index was fuelling market instability because it provided
information on an unequal basis.
The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply said yesterday that it
would distribute the report, which is modelled on the US National
Association of Purchasing Managers index, at 7am - two hours before the
market opens - to all subscribers who pay a premium subscription fee.
Market agencies will receive the information half an hour later, giving the
City equal access to the information before trading starts on the London
markets.
Under the previous system of distributing the index some subscribers were
receiving the information up to two days before the rest of the market.
This gap caused little controversy when the index was launched three years
ago. But in recent months the index has become more price-sensitive.
The staggered release of purchasing managers' expectations about price
increases has had a particular impact on the gilts markets in recent months.
The organisers of the index said yesterday that they hoped the new system
would prevent further leaks.
