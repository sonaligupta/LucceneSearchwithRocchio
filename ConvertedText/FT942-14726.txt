FT  19 APR 94 / UK Company News: Harmony Property in Pounds 7m mixed
portfolio expansion


   By TIM BURT


Harmony Property yesterday signalled another stage in its transformation
from a pubs and restaurant company with the Pounds 7.05m acquisition of a
mixed commercial and retail portfolio.
The transaction, funded from cash reserves and modest borrowing, follows two
months of talks between with Mid-Century Trust, the privately-owned property
developer.
Mr Lewis Davis, Harmony's managing director, said the acquisition -
involving offices and retail outlets in Luton, north London and Southampton
 -would almost double the value of property assets to about Pounds 20m.
'We've sold a number of lossmaking pubs and we're now developing the
property side, that's where we have expertise,' he said.
A weak performance from the group's two hotels and 13 pubs, however, led to
pre-tax losses of Pounds 323,000 in the six months to September 26, against
a Pounds 344,000 deficit last time.
Turnover fell from Pounds 3.09m to Pounds 2.25m, although reduced interest
payments contained losses per share at 0.5p (0.95p).
Mr Davis said the group, which has not paid dividends for several years,
should be in a position to do so next year.
The shares were suspended on the USM yesterday pending a transfer to the
Official List.
