FT  10 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Citibank confirms Samba stake
disposal


   By PATRICK HARVERSON


CITIBANK confirmed yesterday it sold a quarter of its 40 per cent stake in
Saudi American Bank (Samba) last month to two Saudi government-run pension
institutions, writes Patrick Harverson.
The US banking group would not divulge how much money was raised by the sale
of the 10 per cent stake. The full details of the transaction will be
included in Citibank's fourth-quarter results and based on the current value
of Samba shares, the 600,000 shares sold would have been worth about Dollars
336m.
The US bank decided to sell part of its stake in Samba to boost its capital
ratios for the final quarter.
