ROCHE, the Swiss pharmaceutical group, said in a preliminary statement that
consolidated sales in 1991 increased by 19 per cent to SFr11.5bn (Dollars
8.2bn) and it expected 'a gratifying improvement' in profits.
All divisions contributed to the increase, which was only 15 per cent in
local currencies. Sales of the pharmaceutical division, accounting for over
half of the total, were up 23 per cent to SFr5.9bn. The antibiotic Rocephin
and the anti-rheumatic Tilcotil were notable contributors to the growth.
Sales of vitamins and fine chemicals, 24 per cent of the total, grew 14 per
cent to SFr2.7bn, due partly to growing acceptance of the prophylactic
benefits of beta-carotene.
Above-average growth rates were achieved for flavours and chemicals sales,
but demand for fragrances in the luxury perfume sector declined. Division
sales rose 22 per cent to SFr1.3bn.
Sales in the service laboratory business in the US were weaker but the
diagnostics division as a whole had an increase of 8 per cent.
