SG Warburg Securities, the UK investment bank, and Phillips Securities, a
Singapore securities house, bought 27m shares in Sembawang Shipyard at
SDollars 8.01 per share - or a total cost of SDollars 216.27m - and placed
them at SDollars 8.27, or a total of SDollars 223m. The shares were trading
on the stock market at SDollars 8.35 at the time.

Singapore and 20.25m shares were sold internationally, mainly in Asia and
Europe. The deal was oversubscribed by between 1.5 and two times.
