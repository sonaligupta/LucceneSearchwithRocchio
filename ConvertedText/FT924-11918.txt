FT  23 OCT 92 / Bingham Report - Investigation into the BCCI scandal: Lord
Justice Bingham completes 11 month inquiry


LORD JUSTICE BINGHAM completed his 11-month inquiry into BCCI this summer
shortly before being appointed as Master of the Rolls, the most senior civil
court judge in England and Wales. Sir Thomas Bingham, 59, is regarded as
having one of the best intellects on the bench. Those he interviewed for the
inquiry describe him as personable but rigorous.
The only son of two doctors, he was educated at Sedbergh and Balliol
College, Oxford. He was called to the Bar in 1959 and rapidly earned a
reputation as one of the brightest commercial lawyers of his generation and
a brilliant advocate. He was appointed to the High Court bench in 1980 and
to the Court of Appeal in 1986.
In 1977 he was appointed to head the inquiry into Rhodesia sanctions-busting
by UK oil companies. In 1989 he was the first judge to speak out strongly in
favour of the Lord Chancellor's proposed reforms of the legal profession.
