FT  17 JAN 92 / Barriers to investment abroad highlighted


   By ANDREW JACK


CORPORATE tax rates in the member countries of the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development tend to discourage cross-border investment,
according to a survey published by the Institute for Fiscal Studies.
The study says this leaves companies vulnerable to the effects of inflation
by favouring debt finance over equity or retained earnings.
The analysis also shows that the average rate of corporate tax in the UK is
the 10th highest among the 24 countries of the OECD.
The study shows that across member states it is substantially less
attractive for companies to invest abroad than domestically.
The overall average transnational rate of return before tax is 5.9 per cent
for domestic investment. That compares with 7.5 per cent both for countries
in one state investing abroad and for foreign companies investing in the
typical OECD country.
A separate part of the analysis shows that when the real interest rate is 5
per cent across OECD member states, the rate of return required before
corporate taxes to persuade someone to invest in a business enterprise would
be 5.9 per cent. This ignores personal taxes, and assumes average inflation
at 4.5 per cent and average weightings on the different sources of finance.
The figures reflect all corporate taxes and take into account available
deductions.
Turkey has the highest required rate of return at 7.2 per cent. Greece and
Sweden are lowest at 5 per cent; the UK is in the middle, at 5.9 per cent.
The required rate of return on debt - an average 2.8 per cent across all
countries - makes it preferable to new equity (at 6.1 per cent) and retained
earnings (7.9 per cent).
