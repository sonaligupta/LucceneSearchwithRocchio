FT  16 NOV 93 / Senior Tories risk fresh Euro row


   By DAVID OWEN


SENIOR Conservatives drafting the party's manifesto for next June's European
parliament elections have thrown down a gauntlet to Tory Euro-sceptics by
ruling out a review of links with the federalist European People's Party.
The internal committee which is drawing up the manifesto has decided there
is no question of disowning the EPP and that the strategy of aligning with
it is 'rock solid'.
The move will anger Tory Euro-sceptics, some of whom are declining to
canvass for candidates suspected of being 'soft' on federalism.
It follows the decision this month by Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, to
sign a common European socialist manifesto calling for a European foreign
and security policy, a single currency which all member states can join and
urgent measures to cut unemployment.
Tory tacticians believe Mr Smith's endorsement of this document will enable
them to wage an effective and united campaign by highlighting pronounced
differences on how best to engineer economic recovery.
The contrast, they say, would be between a Tory prescription of deregulation
and market-based measures and a Labour-endorsed reflation package. According
to one official: 'The philosophical divide is becoming clearer and clearer.'
Though heartened by the socialist manifesto, Conservative leaders are keenly
aware that continuing divisions on Europe could lead to an embarrassing
defeat next June in a contest which could have important repercussions for
Mr John Major.
Conservative MEPs are aligned to the EPP - the confederation of centre-right
and Christian Democrat parties in the European Union - but are not part of
it and will not be bound by the EPP manifesto.
