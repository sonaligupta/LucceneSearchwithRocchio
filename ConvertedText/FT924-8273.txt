FT  12 NOV 92 / Survey of Jordan (3): Savings fly home - Banking and finance


   By MARK NICHOLSON


JORDAN'S returnees have given the kingdom's banks something akin to a course
of financial steroids. As the estimated 300,000 returnees repatriated their
savings, foreign currency deposits shot up to Dollars 3.2bn in July, against
Dollars 1.4bn at the end of the Gulf war in February 1991.
This huge one-off boost pumped vigour into the banking system: total private
sector deposits, excluding government and interbank deposits, rose 54 per
cent in 1991, overall assets by June this year were up 58 per cent on 1989
at JD5.97bn and the average liquidity ratio of Jordan's commercial banks
stood in June at 65.9 per cent, well over twice the 30 per cent legal
minimum required by the central bank.
But what pleases the central bank most is that this huge influx has not
translated itself into a burst of inflation which would have jeopardised
Jordan's attempts to meet International Monetary Fund targets. The central
bank estimates that inflation will fall this year to 5 or 6 per cent, after
annual rates of 8.2 per cent and 16.1 per cent in 1991 and 1990.
In April last year, the bank imposed tight credit limits on Jordan's banks
to prevent just such a burst, limiting private lending to 10 times a bank's
capital and reserves, or to 90 per cent of its dinar deposits - the latter
aimed at restricting banks' ability to lend on the back of the big rise in
foreign currency deposits.
As a result of the strictures, loans and advances of the 15 main commercial
banks have risen just 10 per cent over the past year, mostly to corporate
customers. The greater part of bank's surplus holdings have found their way
overseas, deposits with foreign banks being up 100 per cent in 1991
over 1990. Amid some signs that Jordan's economic boom was easing, the
central bank removed the credit limits in October. The bank had earlier
approved the reopening of foreign exchange houses in Jordan for the first
time since the country's 68 exchange houses were closed en masse during
Jordan's 1989 currency crisis, which saw the dinar devalued by around 45 per
cent.
However, the dinar has been stable at around its present level for the past
30 or more months and the central bank's foreign currency reserves, worth
JD979m in 1991, stand at more than twice their average level troughout the
1980s.
