   TOKYO


A RIGHTS issue is one option to raise profitability at Foster's Brewing, the
Australian brewer, says Mr Koichiro Iwaki, managing director of Japan's
Asahi Breweries which holds a 19.99 per cent stake in Foster's, Reuter
reports from Tokyo.
'Foster's is considering what should be done to improve its balance sheet
and raise profitability. I think a rights issue is one of the options and
will be considered at the next board meeting,' Mr Iwaki said.
Mr Iwaki is also deputy chairman of Foster's. He said Asahi had no plans to
buy or sell any Foster's shares.
