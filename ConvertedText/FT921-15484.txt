FT  10 JAN 92 / UK likely to face court over big projects


   By JOHN HUNT, Environment Correspondent


IT IS likely that Britain and other EC members will be taken before the
European Court for failure to carry out environmental impact assessments on
large construction projects, Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, EC environment
commissioner, warned last night.
'It seems to me likely that it will fall to be resolved by the European
Court of Justice at the end of the day,' he said.
He said the European Commission was proposing to extend the use of such
assessments to cover proposals and policies put forward by EC governments.
An announcement on the new proposals extending the principle to governments
will be made in two weeks time, he said. At present the directive on impact
assessments applies only to large individual projects.
'It is now clear that this is not enough,' he said. 'It is essential that
policies, plans and programmes are also subjected to environmental impact
assessment.'
He envisaged that this would also apply to EC policy at a later date.
He renewed his strong criticism of the British government for pressing ahead
with large schemes which he had asked to be suspended because environmental
assessments had not been properly made.
The reaction of the British government and some parts of the British media
'have left a bitter taste in my mouth', he said. 'There has been absolutely
no victimisation of the United Kingdom, no singling out to the exclusion of
other member states.'
UK schemes include the Channel tunnel rail link, East London river crossing
and M3 extension near Winchester.
Britain and other EC states have argued that projects in the pipeline when
the directive came into force in July 1988 should be exempted. But the
commission rejected this. He said the commission had opened proceedings for
breach of the directive against 10 governments, including Britain, and
proceedings would soon start against an 11th.
Mr Ripa di Meana's speech was made in London on video to a Green Magazine
awards ceremony.
