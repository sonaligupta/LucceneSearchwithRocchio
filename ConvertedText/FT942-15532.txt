FT  14 APR 94 / International Capital Markets: CBoT meets on Globex


   By LAURIE MORSE


Directors of the Chicago Board of Trade are meeting today to discuss the
exchange's future on Globex, the electronic futures trading system it
developed with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Reuter.
However, despite a flurry of communications between the partners this month,
CBoT, the world's busiest futures exchange, is preparing to leave Globex
next week.
'Unless something changes, our Globex screens will go dark on April 22,'
said Mr David Prosperi of CBoT. That is when the current agreement between
Reuter and the two Chicago exchanges expires.
With Reuter, the CME and the Matif endorsing a new Globex contract that
would require CBoT to run its evening floor trading session side-by-side
with computer trading, CBoT has few options.
If the CBoT board votes to remain with Globex by extending the terms of its
existing contract, it will be overridden by either Reuter or the CME, which
favour a new arrangement to attract other exchanges to the system. The CBoT
is still disputing details of that arrangement, and is not obliged to
endorse it.
