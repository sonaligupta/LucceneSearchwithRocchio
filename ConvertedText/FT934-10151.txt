FT  06 NOV 93 / Briefcase, Q&A: Will must have witnesses


COULD YOU clarify the legal position regarding any will written on plain
paper using a computer and signed without any witness being present.
A will which is drawn up and signed by a testator without being witnessed is
invalid. In order for a will to be valid, all of the following conditions
must be met:
1. It must be in writing (computer type on plain paper will suffice).
2. It must be signed by the testator at the end of the writing in the
presence of two witnesses who must see the testator sign.
3. The testator's signature must then be witnessed by the two witnesses who
(or whose spouses) are not beneficiaries of the will.
4. The testator must be of sound mind and over the age of 18.
5. The testator must intend the will to be operative as a testamentary
disposition.
