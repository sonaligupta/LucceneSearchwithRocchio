How long before people start yearning for the good old days when Europe's
big bad ogre was that cuddly old bear, the Soviet Union? The speed with
which post-unification Germany seems to be reverting, in so many minds, to
the bete noire of Europe is both startling and somewhat frightening.
It seems a suitable moment for Channel 4 to start its series The Germans
(9.00), examining the country and its people.
At 9.30 BBC2 begins its series on 'the new Spain', Fire In The Blood. BBC2's
other new series, Redundant (8.00), was prompted by the number of businesses
which closed in 1991; more than 400 every working day.
The opening programme looks at Tills of Battle, said to be the oldest
ironmonger in Britain, which was established in 1680, survived revolution,
wars and depression, but was forced into voluntary liquidation three weeks
before Christmas.
In Talking To Myself well-known people interview themselves, beginning with
Esther Rantzen (10.20).
The subject of Perpetual Motion, the excellent series about long-lived
vehicles (8.30 BBC2), is the Enfield Bullet motorcycle, built in Britain in
the 1950s and still being produced (20,000 a year) in India.
