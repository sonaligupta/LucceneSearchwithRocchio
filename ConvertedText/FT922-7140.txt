   By NEIL WEINBERG


YAMAHA Motor, the world's second leading motorcycle manufacturer, saw an
11.9 per cent decline in non-consolidated pre-tax profits in the year ended
March. It blamed the drop on unfavourable foreign exchange moves.
In contrast, company sales climbed 5.5 per cent to Y480.5bn (Dollars
3.61bn). Domestic turnover slipped 1.2 to per cent to Y198bn on sluggish
demand for sports motorcycles.
Total export sales, however, gained 10.8 per cent to Y282.5bn, led by a 16.7
per cent jump in motorcycle shipments. Demand recovered in the US and was
also strong in Europe and Asia, the company said.
By sector, sales of motorcycles increased 10 per cent to Y231.3bn, and
special-duty products, including golf carts, 2.5 per cent to Y47.1bn. Marine
equipment sales fell 4.4 per cent to Y107.9bn, and auto engines 5 per cent
to Y39.7bn.
For the year to March 1993, Yamaha expects pre-tax profits to fall 13.4 per
cent to Y6.5bn, on a 1 per cent gain in sales to Y485bn.
