FT  15 NOV 93 / Manufacturing jobs 'to fall sharply' in western nations


   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor


MANUFACTURING industry in the leading industrial countries could be
employing less than 10 per cent of the workforce in 30 years, according to
two prize-winning economists.
Ms DeAnne Julius, the chief economist of British Airways, and Mr Richard
Brown, a UK economic consultant, say faster falls in employment can be
expected in countries such as Germany, Japan and Italy.
But in an essay that has won this year's Dollars 25,000 first prize in the
annual Amex Bank Review Awards competition, they argue that it would be
'costly and ultimately fruitless' for industrial country members of the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to try to stop the
trend through subsidies or protection. The share of manufacturing in total
employment has already fallen sharply in recent years to around 15 per cent
in the US and to 32 per cent in Germany.
Ms Julius and Mr Brown say the current shift away from manufacturing towards
service sector employment within OECD countries and the migration of
manufacturing jobs to low-cost developing countries are 'desirable and
natural'.
The shift of employment away from manufacturing will be analogous to the
fall in agricultural employment in the industrial countries earlier in this
century when, according to their analysis, displaced agricultural workers
tended to find jobs predominantly in the services sector.
'Left to market forces and assuming continued technological progress, there
is little reason to suppose that manufacturing employment should follow a
very different path over the next 50 years than agricultural employment has
over the past 50.'
The economists say industrial country governments should respond to the
changes by upgrading and broadening their education systems to produce
workers with sufficient flexibility and productivity to underpin expanding
service sectors. They should also support free trade in services.
