FT  25 AUG 92 / UN studies Khmer Rouge terms


The United Nations is studying new conditions set by the Khmer Rouge for the
guerrilla group to implement Cambodia's peace accords, agencies report from
Phnom Penh. Khmer Rouge leader Khieu Samphan delivered the conditions to a
meeting of Cambodia's Supreme National Council (SNC) in Phnom Penh. The
Khmer Rouge wants the SNC's power increased by the establishment of
consultative committees to work with the UN in supervising the
administration and policing of the four rival factions.
