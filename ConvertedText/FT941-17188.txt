FT  06 JAN 94 / Neither a Fed nor a Bundesbank


   By DAVID BUCHAN


   PARIS


The monetary policy committee (MPC) is the only part of the Bank of France
which will now be independent of overt government control.
The government will retain a say in the remaining Bank of France activities,
which include supervising commercial banks, compiling corporate data,
running the payments clearing system, providing management advice to
industry, and conducting some private banking.
The government decided to leave the central bank's structure intact, but to
create within it the MPC as a sanctuary against political influence on
monetary policy, money supply, interest rates and the consequences of these
for the external and internal value of the franc.
The MPC's nine members - the six outside directors appointed yesterday and
the the bank's governor, Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, and his two deputy
governors - are forbidden to 'solicit or accept' external instruction on the
conduct of monetary policy. But as Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy
minister, said yesterday: 'The bridges with the (economy) ministry are not
cut. Concertation and discussion (with the government) will obviously be
maintained as in the US or Germany.'
The issue of accountability remains unclear. The MPC, which will hold its
first meeting next week, is different from both Bundesbank and Federal
Reserve. It must decide the degree to which its president should follow the
Fed example of appearing regularly before parliament, or the Bundesbank
example of press conferences, or combining both.
