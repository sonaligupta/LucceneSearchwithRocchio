FT  05 JUN 92 / UK Company News: IWP rises 19% to IPounds 11m and seeks
acquisition

IWP International, the Irish industrial holding company, reported pre-tax
profits ahead 19 per cent, from IPounds 9.2m to IPounds 11m (Pounds 10m),
for the year to March 31. Turnover rose 3.6 per cent to IPounds 92.6m.
The company was originally a wire and fastenings manufacturer, but following
reorganisation in 1987 and a rapid series of acquisitions, diversified into
printing and packaging, telecommunications and household product manufacture
which included firelighters, air fresheners and disinfectants.
A new management team brought in 1990 put a halt to the acquisition
programme in order to consolidate the company and get its financial
structure under control.
Mr Joe Moran, chairman and chief executive, said the outcome was a result of
that reorganisation, which has brought gearing down from 129.6 per cent two
years ago to the current 36.5 per cent and seen IPounds 6.5m invested in
manufacturing plants over the same period.
He said that in consequence the group's product lines have dropped in price
over the past year, but margins and turnover have increased.
The group was now ready to make a substantial new acquisition 'either in
household products or in printing and packaging' which he said would be a
'strategic add-on business'.
Earnings per share rose 16 per cent to 28.1p (24.3p) and a recommended final
dividend of 3.85p makes an increased total of 6.6p (6p).
