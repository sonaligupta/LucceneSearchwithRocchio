FT  16 MAR 94 / Krona to keep on floating

   FRANKFURT


The Swedish krona is likely to float for an extended period and remain
outside the European Union's Exchange Rate Mechanism, Mr Thomas Franzen,
deputy governor of Sweden's central bank, said yesterday. 'The lesson we
have learned from developments in recent years is that we must first get the
(Swedish) economy in order,' he told a seminar in Stockholm. He predicted
that European interest rates would continue to decline. 'Monetary policy is
unchanged in Europe despite the recent turbulence (in markets), which means
continued successive interest rate cuts.'
