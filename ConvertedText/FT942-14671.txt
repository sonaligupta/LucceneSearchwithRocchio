FT  19 APR 94 / International Company News: Charge for litigation costs
checks rise at Microsoft

   SAN FRANCISCO


Microsoft, the world's largest computer software company, reported record
revenues for its third fiscal quarter, although earnings were reduced by a
Dollars 120m charge for litigation.
Revenues for the quarter were Dollars 1.24bn, a 30 per cent increase over
the Dollars 958m for the same period last year. Net earnings for the quarter
were Dollars 256m, or 84 cents a share, after the litigation charge, against
Dollars 243m, or 80 cents.
In February, a Los Angeles jury ordered Microsoft to pay damages to Stac
Electronics for infringement of patents covering data-compression
technology. Microsoft said it would seek a reversal of the verdict and
would, if necessary, file an appeal.
Excluding this charge, net income for the quarter would have been Dollars
336m, up 38 per cent from the same quarter last year, with earnings a share
of Dollars 1.11, well above Wall Street expectations of about Dollars 1.01.
'This is another record-breaking quarter for the company,' said Mr Mike
Brown, vice-president of finance and treasurer, 'with revenues reaching an
all-time high. While we've had good results across our product line,
Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office continue to lead the way.'
Windows is Microsoft's widely-used personal computer operating system, while
'Office' is a suit of applications products.
For the nine-month period, revenues were Dollars 3.36bn, up from Dollars
2.71bn in the same period last year. Net income was Dollars 784m, or Dollars
2.58 a share, compared with Dollars 688m, or Dollars 2.28.
