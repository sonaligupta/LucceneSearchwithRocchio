FT  20 NOV 92 / International Company News: Japanese trading companies to
cut top salaries

EXECUTIVES at some of Japan's leading trading companies are facing salary
cuts of between 5 per cent and 10 per cent after their companies yesterday
reported sharp falls in profits for the first half of the financial year.
The downturn in the domestic economy was the main reason for the falls in
pre-tax profits which ranged from 25.6 per cent at Mitsubishi and 33.7 per
cent at Sumitomo.
All the trading houses suffered large falls in the value of their securities
investments held by special trusts. The houses' finances are a broad
reflection of the state of the Japanese economy as well as its trade flows.
Mitsubishi's pre-tax profits fell by more than a quarter to Y31bn (Dollars
249m) for the six months to the end of September on a 3.3 per cent fall in
sales to Y7,502bn.
The deterioration in Mitsubishi's profits was mainly due to a continued rise
in operating costs, which were up by 7 per cent. That was the main factor
behind a 32 per cent fall operating profits to Y35bn. Earnings per share
were Y8.11, down from Y14.14 a year earlier.
The Mitsubishi board yesterday decided to cut top executive salaries by an
average of 10 per cent from the end of this month.
The decline in Mitsubishi's sales was most pronounced in Japan where the
economic downturn prompted a 6.9 per cent fall in sales which account for
about 46 per cent of the group's total sales. Fuel sales rose by 8.9 per
cent but chemicals fell by 10.7 per cent and machinery by 8.3 per cent.
Sumitomo reported a 33 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y23bn on sales of
Y8,596bn, down 9.1 per cent from the first half of last year.
The group's operating profits were almost halved to Y13bn because, despite
the fall in sales, its general and administrative expenses rose by 7 per
cent mainly due to higher labour costs.
Machinery sales were 3.3 per cent up, but sales of metal and steel fell 22
per cent, while chemicals and fuel were 9.5 per cent down and textiles 9.2
per cent lower.
Sumitomo sharply increased its provisions for doubtful receivables from
Y189m to Y655m, while its valuation loss on securities holdings rose from
Y769m last year to Y1.2bn, reflecting the slump in the Tokyo stock market.
Income from the sales of securities fell by Y1.6bn to Y3.9bn, while cash on
deposit was cut by Y410m to Y934m.
Mitsui's pre-tax profits fell by 21.4 per cent to Y25bn on a 7.5 per cent
fall in sales to Y7,712bn. Operating profits were 24 per cent down at Y24bn.
Marubeni blamed the appreciation of the yen against the US dollar for an
erosion of its profit margins on its foreign trade related businesses. Its
pre-tax profits fell by 32.6 per cent to Y15bn on a 4.5 per cent fall in
sales to Y8,283bn.
Itochu, formerly C. Itoh, is cutting executive salaries by between 5 per
cent and 10 per cent from next month despite reporting an 11.5 per cent
increase in first half pre-tax profits to Y22bn on a 9.1 per cent decline in
sales to Y9,201bn.
The profit increase was mainly due to increased dividends from foreign
subsidiaries and non-operating financial income.
Sales in the metals division fell by 23 per cent as the company cut back on
gold trading. Itochu said it had made an appraisal loss of about Y90bn on
its securities investments, worth about 30 per cent of its outstanding
securities investments.
Nissho Iwai's pre-tax profits fell by 15.7 per cent to Y8bn on a 5.5 per
cent drop in sales to Y5,198bn. Nissho Iwai said it made an appraisal loss
of about Y20bn on its securities holdings which are worth about Y220bn.
