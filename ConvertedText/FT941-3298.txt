Digital's investment in Scotland


   By MICHAEL WILTSHIRE


Digital Equipment Corporation, a leading supplier of networked computer
systems, has announced an investment package of more than Pounds 90m for its
Scottish manufacturing sites in Ayr and South Queensferry.
Mr Chris Conway, managing director of Digital UK says this investment
confirms the company's commitment to manufacturing in Scotland where it
makes a range of products from silicon chips to implemented computer systems
 -'half of Digital's revenues come from Europe and the UK leads the field in
both sales and manufacturing,' he adds. Digital's total investment in
Scotland stands at Pounds 300m.
The latest investment package involves more than Pounds 65m for the South
Queensferry facility. This will increase production capacity for the Alpha
AXP silicon chip.
