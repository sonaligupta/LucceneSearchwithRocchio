FT  19 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Storehouse


Storehouse's chairman had some choice criticisms to make when Mr David
Dworkin resigned as chief executive after just six months in the job. Sadly,
his strictures appear to have fallen on deaf ears. Storehouse's revolving
door continues to whirl around with Ms Ann Iverson, chief executive of
Mothercare, being the latest to whoosh out. She, at least, will have had the
tenacity to do her job for two years. But her departure makes a mockery of
the company's watchword of stability and knocked 5 per cent off the shares.
That may seem excessive. Ms Iverson's team has done well to turn round
Mothercare and the chain appears to have acquired considerable trading
momentum. Its new store format is being successfully developed. The chain is
recording some of the strongest sales figures on the high street. The scope
for margin recovery is clear: last year, Mothercare accounted for 27 per
cent of group sales but just 10 per cent of profits.
Even so, the market is understandably averse to companies which have such a
dismal record of retaining staff. The remaining executive directors boast
less than three years' board experience between them. That is alarming when
consistency is such a vital ingredient of retailing success. Storehouse
suggests that while Ms Iverson's loss is disappointing, it will be no great
blow to Mothercare's recovery. If so, one wonders why Storehouse feels it
necessary to reward its directors so lavishly.
