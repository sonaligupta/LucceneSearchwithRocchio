FT  05 MAR 94 / Nissan falls foul of soccer land row


   By CHRIS TIGHE


Sunderland Football Club yesterday won an important part of its fight with
Nissan over the club's plans for a Pounds 70m sports, entertainment and
conference centre on land beside the Japanese carmaker's Pounds 900m plant.
In a report made public before next Thursday's meeting of Sunderland city
council's environment committee, councillors are recommended to give the
club's project outline planning approval.
The recommendation is a blow to Nissan, which has argued that the complex
would block expansion and jeopardise its component delivery and production
methods.
However because the club's proposal for green-belt land is a major departure
from Sunderland's present development plan, the application must be referred
to Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, who may announce a public
inquiry.
Yesterday the report's author Mr Ed Robson, Sunderland's director of
architecture and planning, said it had been a difficult decision.
Mr Robson - a Newcastle United supporter - was co-ordinator for the Wearside
local authorities which 10 years ago this month clinched the Nissan project,
the UK's biggest inward investment of the 1980s.
In his report, he says Nissan did not indicate when the plan for future
expansion was being prepared; nor could the site be protected for Nissan
simply by withholding planning consent for other developments.
Mr Robson's report concludes that the application would bring significant
economic and employment opportunities and private-sector investment, provide
a major new regional facility and significantly enhance the image of
Sunderland and the region.
Nissan said it did not wish to pre-judge next week's decision, but welcomed
the possibility of a public inquiry.
