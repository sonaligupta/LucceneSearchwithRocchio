FT  29 APR 94 / Teamsters closer to deal to end strike


   By GEORGE GRAHAM


   WASHINGTON


Management and union representatives edged closer to agreement yesterday on
a deal that could end a three-week strike at the US's largest road haulage
companies, writes George Graham in Washington. Officials of the Teamsters
union said the main issues had been resolved in talks hosted by federal
government mediators, with the union accepting some of the trucking
companies' demands for more part-time workers and greater use of rail
transport in exchange for increases in pay and benefits.
Trucking Management, a consortium representing the haulage companies, said
no agreement had yet been finalised, and Teamster officials acknowledged
that substantial differences remained between the two sides.
The strike, the first national stoppage called by the once-powerful
Teamsters for 15 years, had pulled 75,000 drivers and terminal workers out
at 22 trucking companies.
