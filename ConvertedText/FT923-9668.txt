FT  04 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Production problems hold back Clarke Foods


   By PEGGY HOLLINGER


PRODUCTION problems held back Clarke Foods, Britain's second biggest
ice-cream manufacturer and owner of Lyons Maid, which yesterday reported
pre-tax profits of Pounds 168,000 for the six months to May 2.
Mr Henry Clarke, chairman, said equipment problems meant the company did not
have enough product available at the beginning of the summer.
'That delay was a very bad thing,' he said, '. . . but it is behind us now.'
The half year results compared with profits last time of Pounds 364,000.
However, 1991 profits were boosted by Pounds 305,000 in interest income
compared with charges this time of Pounds 108,000.
The interim dividend is being maintained at 0.75p from earnings of 0.05p
(1.65p). Sales surged from Pounds 1.8m to Pounds 10.4m, due to a full
contribution from Hillsdown and two months from Lyons Maid.
