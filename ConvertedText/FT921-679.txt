FT  27 MAR 92 / Car shipper is bailed on tax fraud charges


   By JOHN GRIFFITHS


NORWEGIAN businessman Mr Tore Arne Thorsen appeared in Teesside magistrates'
court, Middlesbrough, yesterday for a further hearing into corporation tax
fraud charges relating to Nissan UK, the former importer of Japanese cars to
the UK controlled by Mr Octav Botnar.
Mr Thorsen, manager of Scansiris, a Norwegian freight company, is accused of
fraudulently inflating invoices when shipping cars from Japan to Nissan UK.
The Inland Revenue says that resulted in the company's profits being
understated by Pounds 100m over 10 years.
Yesterday's hearing was adjourned until June 18. Mr Thorsen, who is on bail,
entered no plea, but his solicitor says Mr Thorsen will deny all the
charges.
Mr Botnar himself, for whom an arrest warrant was issued in January, has yet
to return to the UK. Mr Botnar, 79, has been in Switzerland since before
Christmas.
Mr Michael Hunt, Nissan UK's assistant managing director, and Mr Frank
Shannon, a former finance director of Nissan UK, have appeared at
preliminary hearings into alleged corporation tax fraud.
