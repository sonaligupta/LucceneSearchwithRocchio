FT  16 JAN 92 / International Company News: Foreigners offered Shanghai
shares

THE development of a western-style capital market in China took a further
step forward yesterday when the Shanghai Stock Exchange announced the first
public offering to foreign investors of shares in a Chinese company.
The exchange said that 1m 'B' shares in Shanghai Vacuum Electron Devices
Company, a maker of core components for the Chinese television industry,
will be offered to foreign investors on Monday and would be available for
three days.
The shares, with a face value of Yn100 (Dollars 18.5), will be sold to
foreigners for Yn420 each, to raise Yn420m, or Dollars 78m. They will be
listed on the Shanghai exchange for trading on February 20.
Shanghai Vacuum is the most important company listed on the Shanghai
exchange, representing 70 per cent of the exchange's total market
capitalisation.
The success of the issue will be regarded as an indicator of China's likely
success in the future with similar offerings to foreign investors.
The Chinese government and its agencies, which currently control 73 per cent
of the company, expect their shareholding in Shanghai Vacuum to fall to
around 50 per cent as more of the company is sold to foreign and domestic
investors.
Recently 2m 'A' shares were issued to the Chinese investing public.
The 'B' shares on offer confer the same rights of ownership on foreign
investors as the 'A' shares do upon domestic investors, with respect to
voting rights, dividends and participation in new share issues.
They will, however, only be able to be traded on the Shanghai exchange which
will keep a registry of ownership.
As one foreign broker to the issue said yesterday, the Chinese government
would always outnumber other investors on the company's share register and
decisions concerning the company would always be influenced by the state.
