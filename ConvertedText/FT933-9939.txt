FT  06 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Aspen shares tumble on setback


SHARES OF Aspen Communications yesterday fell 50p to a low for the year of
145p on news of halved operating profits for the six months to end-June.
However, exceptional credits of Pounds 865,000 following the sale of its
commercial radio interests enabled the USM-quoted supplier of printing,
media and communications services to lift its pre-tax profits for the period
from Pounds 923,000 to Pounds 1.29m. The results were compiled under FRS 3
accounting principles.
Sales for the six months rose to Pounds 30.2m (Pounds 28.9m) but at the
operating level profits dropped from Pounds 1.34m to Pounds 621,000.
The exceptional credit compared with a Pounds 168,000 debit previously.
Within the specialist printing division margins in the second quarter were
hit by cost and competitive factors.
In marketing services, sales fell by 6.2 per cent to Pounds 9.5m, mainly
reflecting the downturn in trading in the direct marketing agencies in
France and the Netherlands. In the UK Aspen Field Marketing experienced
lower profits due to reduced spending by clients.
Media and communications benefited from improved volumes to report higher
sales of Pounds 9.2m (Pounds 7.7m). However, Aspen Business Communications
was disappointed by a deterioration in trading.
Mr Henry Meakin, chairman, said the results were disappointing following the
improvement seen in the second half of 1992, but he was confident that
progress would resume in the second half.
Net tangible assets at June 30 were Pounds 12.2m (Pounds 10.3m) and net
borrowings of Pounds 2.31m (Pounds 4.9m) meant gearing of 19.1 per cent
(47.6 per cent).
The interim dividend is held at 2p on earnings per share of 6.6p (4.6p).
