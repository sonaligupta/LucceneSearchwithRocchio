FT  08 NOV 94 / Survey of India (13): Receipts valued at Dollars 10bn -
Martin Brice describes a new way to buy shares


   By MARTIN BRICE


India's growing attractiveness to international investors is shown by the
dramatic increase over the last two years in the purchase of shares in
Indian companies through the medium of Global Depositary Receipts.
These documents, issued by depositary banks, are used to facilitate purchase
of shares in the issuer's home market. Since the first Indian GDR was issued
in 1992, the total value has risen to Dollars 10bn. About Dollars 4bn of
this is based on the shares of 50 Indian companies. Some Dollars 2.1bn of
Indian GDRs have been issued this year alone.
Mr David Gibbons, head of India research at James Capel said: 'India has
streaked ahead of China. Using GDRs it has moved with astonishing rapidity
and if that continues India will have a huge advantage.'
Mr Ian Hannam, director of Jardine Fleming, the invest- ment bank, says:
'The great thing about corporate India is that the shackles are now coming
off. You have the potential of huge growth with a proper regulatory
framework to work within.'
GDRs were pioneered in 1990 by the US Citibank, but today much of the GDRs
business is sourced from London-based investment banks and 90 depositary
receipts are traded via SEAQ International and listed on the Luxembourg
stock exchange. In August, the London Stock Exchange changed its rules to
allow GDRs to be listed there.
GDRs and the shares they represent are traded indep- endently, which often
means they fetch a lower or higher price than the shares in the home market.
The GDRs are easier to trade and settlement is simpler than dealing in
shares on the local market.
According to Mr Hannam, India has many attractions over other emerging
markets, particularly the existence of a middle class as big as the
population of the US. It also had a recognised legal and accounting
framework for the ownership of assets and the use of the English language.'
Mr Tristan Clube, director of Edinburgh-based Martin Currie Investment
Management, which runs the Dollars 270m India Opportunities investment fund,
agrees: 'We are seeing for the first time the spending power of the vast
middle class.'
This middle class is growing at 12 per cent a year, says Mr Jeff Chowdhry, a
director of BZW Investment Management, which runs the BZW India Fund. 'This
is creating incredible demand for domest- ically-produced goods. This
consumer demand is being unshackled by liberalisation.'
The liberalisation process was irreversible, he added, predicting that the
earnings of Indian companies would grow by 35 per cent each year for the
next two years.
Expectation of high returns has prompted many inter- national investors to
buy GDRs issued by Indian companies, but these are by their nature
restricted to big companies with a market capitalisation of more than about
Dollars 300m. Mr Chowdhry said: 'The value in India and the thing that makes
it most attractive is not large capitalisation companies, it is medium-sized
companies.'
Shares in big companies were selling on a price/earnings ratio of about 30
times, whereas medium-sized companies sold on a profits/earnings ratio of 15
times, making them much cheaper as investments.
International investors can also gain access to Indian equities by buying
into investment funds. Mr Clube of Martin Currie points to the growth in
interest in Indian equities by referring to the increase in the number of
funds. When his India Opp- ortunities fund was launched last year there were
a handful of similar funds. Now there were about 22.
