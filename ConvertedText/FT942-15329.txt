FT  15 APR 94 / International Company News: Audi reverses into the red

Audi, the quality car division of Volkswagen, yesterday reported a 1993 loss
of DM89m (Dollars 52m) against a DM172m profit the previous year.
However, orders in the first quarter were up 23 per cent on the year before,
bolstering hopes that the company would break even again this year.
Mr Herbert Demel, who was appointed chief executive in February, said the
company hoped to raise its position in the market with a range of new
models, including the A6, the A8 and the RS2, which will be co-produced with
the sports car maker Porsche.
'We have very nearly overcome the trough of the current recession,' Mr Demel
said.
The Audi workforce agreed in March to work 10 per cent fewer hours, saving a
further 3,000 jobs which were due to go, the company said.
In the year ending March 31 the workforce at the company's two plants in
southern Germany had fallen 10.5 per cent to 32,353.
Audi said part of its losses was caused by 'our commitment to shedding jobs
in a socially acceptable manner'.
Production in 1993 fell 30.7 per cent to 340,956 cars while deliveries to
customers worldwide dropped 25.1 per cent to 354,158 units. The UK was the
only exception in a still depressed car market, the company said.
Production in the first quarter of 1994 rose 6 per cent to 80,473 units but
orders for the German market, where Audi's share dropped from 5.7 to 5.3 per
cent last year, were still down on last year, the company said.
