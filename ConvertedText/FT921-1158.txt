FT  25 MAR 92 / Election 1992: In at the top - Ballot Box


One man who could be much in demand should Labour form the next government
is Lord Richard of Ammanford QC. Still perhaps best known as Ivor Richard,
he is being mentioned as a possible Labour leader in the upper house should
the present incumbent, the 75-year-old Lord Cledwyn, wish to give way. He is
also well in the running for the Lord Chancellorship, where Lord Mackay of
Clashfern would not survive a change of regime. There is also talk of his
returning to Brussels as Britain's senior commissioner at the European
Community.
So what is Richard doing during the election? He says he is getting on with
his legal work and has written to Jack Cunningham, who is organising the
Labour campaign, offering his services. Nothing is yet fixed, but Richard is
likely to be seen helping Alf Dubs to fight the marginal seat of Battersea.
Richard was MP for nearby Barons Court from 1964 to 1974. Harold Wilson then
made him Britain's permanent representative at the United Nations, after
which he had what may turn out to be a first spell as commissioner in
Brussels. Now aged 60, he is clearly open to offers, but talk of Brussels
surprised him.
