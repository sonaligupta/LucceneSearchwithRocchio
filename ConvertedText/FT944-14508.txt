FT  22 OCT 94 / UK Company News: High Point loss little changed


The expected return to profitability at High-Point, the engineering and
consultancy group, failed to materialise and there was a marginally
increased full-year pre-tax loss of Pounds 442,000, against Pounds 440,000.
The shares fell 9p to 46p.
The figure, which Mr Peter Johnson, chairman, described as 'disappointing',
came from turnover of Pounds 43.2m (Pounds 48.6m) for the year to May 31.
The 1993 loss was, however, struck after a profit of Pounds 955,000 on the
disposal of discontinued operations.
Interest charges took Pounds 1.07m (Pounds 1.59m) as borrowings remained
'unacceptably high'.
After tax of Pounds 118,000 (Pounds 2,000) losses per share deepened to
11.5p (8.6p). The proposed dividend is maintained at 0.5p.
