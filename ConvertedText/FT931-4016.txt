VARITY, the automotive parts, farm equipment and diesel engine maker,
yesterday reported a sharp improvement in financial performance over the
past year, including a two-thirds jump in operating income and a similar
drop in long-term debt.
Net earnings of the Buffalo-based company were USDollars 27m, or 32 cents a
share, in the year to January 31, compared with a Dollars 178m loss, or
Dollars 7.87 a share, in the previous 12 months.
Before extraordinary items, income in the latest period was Dollars 39.7m.
These items include a Dollars 23.6m loss from the sale of Massey Ferguson's
distribution and finance business.
The bulk of the previous year's loss consisted of a Dollars 108.3m
restructuring charge. Sales for the year rose to Dollars 3.37bn from Dollars
3.17bn.
Operating income, excluding restructuring losses, jumped to Dollars 218m
from Dollars 131m. Long-term debt stood at Dollars 305.2m on January 31,
down from Dollars 864.2m a year earlier.
Varity's improved fortunes have been reflected in a sharp rise in its share
price on the New York stock exchange. The shares closed yesterday at Dollars
31.50, up from Dollars 25.25 at the beginning of the year.
