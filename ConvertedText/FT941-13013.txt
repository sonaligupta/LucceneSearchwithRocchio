FT  27 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Trifast pathfinder sees Pounds 2.55m for
year


   By ANDREW BAXTER


Trifast, the Sussex-based industrial fastener group which is coming to the
market next month, expects pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.55m for the year to
March 31, compared with Pounds 1.98m, according to the pathfinder prospectus
issued yesterday.
The company, which manufactures and distributes fasteners under the TR
Fastenings trade name, is seeking a listing through a placing which will
value it at between Pounds 25m and Pounds 30m.
Trifast said earlier this month that the placing was expected to raise about
Pounds 15m. About two thirds of that will go to the company's two founders,
Mr Mike Timms and Mr Mike Roberts who are reducing their 90 per cent stake
to between 30 per cent and 50 per cent. This would leave between Pounds 3m
and Pounds 4m for the company.
Trifast said that the listing would give the company access to a wider
capital market. The proceeds would provide it with additional scope to
finance growth as well as repaying debt to strengthen the balance sheet and
help the company make appropriate acquisitions.
The announcement of the placing, which is being sponsored by James Capel, is
expected on February 9, with dealings beginning on February 16.
