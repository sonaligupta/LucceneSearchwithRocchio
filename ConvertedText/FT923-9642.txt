FT  04 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt drops on fears of
Lombard rate rise


   By Our Markets Staff


INTEREST rate fears weighed on Frankfurt yesterday, but Paris and Milan
jumped on domestic developments, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT weakened on fears that the Bundesbank may be forced to lift the
Lombard rate at Thursday's council meeting. While most analysts think this
is unlikely, the market has become so nervous that the slightest rumour is
enough to drive prices down. Renewed pressure on Allianz and Deutsche Bank
led the FAZ index down 5.06 to 631.84 at midsession, while the DAX index
ended down 20.71 at 1,594.71, its lowest close for seven months. Turnover
was a low DM3.8bn after DM4.6bn on Friday.
Allianz remained vulnerable, reaching an intraday low of DM1,722 before
recovering slightly to close down DM60 or 3.3 per cent at DM1,777. Deutsche
Bank worsened, losing DM12 to DM637 ahead of tomorrow's half-year results
which are expected to be disappointing. Dresdner Bank, which reports today,
was down DM2 at DM325.
Among car makers, BMW continued to outperform, up DM3.80 at DM556.80. James
Capel in London issued a sell note on the stock yesterday, following a visit
to the company on Friday. The broker forecast that BMW's earnings growth in
1992 and 1993 will be stunted by weakness in the dollar against the D-Mark,
a less favourable model and engine mix, falling Japanese sales and a higher
tax charge.
Lufthansa was again weak after last week's announcement that it was to shed
some non-profitable US routes. Its shares fell DM9.50 or 8.7 per cent to
DM100.
PARIS jumped on news that an opinion poll showed 57 per cent in favour of
the Maastricht treaty. But analysts warned that the market was being driven
by sentiment rather than fundamentals and that a rally could be short-lived.
The CAC-40 index finished 29.77 or 1.7 per cent higher at 1,784.44 in
moderate turnover of FFr1.5bn.
Financials were lifted by a strong bond market as Societe Generale rose
FFr26.60 or 5.9 per cent to FFr475.60 and UAP recovered from a low of
FFr275.50 to close FFr3.40 down at FFr393.10.
LVMH was another winner, rising FFr156 to FFr3,736 but Euro Disney failed to
join in the rally, losing another FFr1.20 to FFr83.80.
MILAN jumped 3.7 per cent following the well-publicised agreement between
the government, trade unions and employers to scrap wage indexation. There
were hopes that the accord would allow the Bank of Italy to cut interest
rates. The Comit index rose 14.92 to 416.64 in turnover estimated at around
L100bn after Friday's L87.4bn.
Traders attributed most of the rise to professional short-covering, and to a
slight improvement in attitude from domestic investment funds. But there was
virtually no foreign interest, apart from some residual selling. Fiat rose
L244 to L4,624, Montedison rose L70 to L1,190 and Generali rose L175 to
L27,520.
Due to a breakdown in the computer trading system, closing prices of the 35
shares listed on the system had to be fixed by traditional open outcry at
the end of the session.
The Banca Popolare di Bergamo-Credito Varesino, created by a merger between
the two regional banks, made its debut on the main market yesterday. It
closed L120 higher at L13,670.
ZURICH's SMI index lost 3.2 to 1,794.9 in quiet trading. Nestle bearers fell
SFr130 to SFr9,240 and its registered shares lost SFr70 to SFr9,250.
BRUSSELS was weaker, and trading in Clabecq was temporarily suspended after
the steel maker predicted heavy 1991-92 losses. Clabecq closed BFr250 or
19.2 per cent lower at BFr1,050. The Bel-20 Index lost 7.48 to 1,137.78.
Electrabel bucked the trend, gaining BFr40 to BFr4,550 in spite of the
government announcing in its budget package yesterday that it plans to levy
a new fixed tax on electricity producers.
AMSTERDAM enjoyed a stronger day, the CBS Tendency index rising 0.4 to
116.6.
Akzo gained Fl 2.70 to Fl 146.50 ahead of today's half-year results which
are expected to be positive. Philips, which reports on Thursday, improved 50
cents to Fl 24.50.
STOCKHOLM slipped in featureless trading. The Affarsvarlden General Index
eased 2.3 to 859.4 in thin turnover of SKr182m. Astra continued to dominate
trading, as the A share slipped SKr1 to SKr558.
The dollar-sensitive forest sector fell 1.4 per cent while the wholesale and
retail sector posted the session's best result, up 1.6 per cent as Hennes &
Maurtiz rose SKr4 to SKr139.
OSLO's all-share index fell 2.15 to 381.01 in turnover of NKr52.92m, the
lowest since September 1988. Uni Storebrand free A shares fell NKr3 to NKr25
on news of its planned share issue.
VIENNA's ATX index slumped 15.71 or 2 per cent to 766.91 on news of further
developments in the finance ministry inquiry into possible insider trading
in OMV shares in late June and early July.
ISTANBUL eased ahead of today's publication of July inflation figures. The
75-share index closed 7.95 lower at 4,256.18.
