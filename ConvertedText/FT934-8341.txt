FT  16 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Fenner omits dividend after drop to Pounds
315,000


   By DAVID BLACKWELL


FENNER, the Hull-based industrial products group, is omitting its dividend
after a sharp fall to Pounds 315,000 in pre-tax profits for the year to
August 31.
The outcome compared with profits of Pounds 5.5m last year, when total
dividends amounted to 4.2p. Operating profits before exceptional items fell
from Pounds 11.3m to Pounds 9.6m.
Exceptional charges of Pounds 7.92m mainly comprised restructuring costs in
the power transmission business but also included Pounds 1.2m for an aborted
merger earlier this year.
The figures were in line with the company's estimate published in September
at the launch of a rights issue, which, coupled with a 5 per cent share
subscription by European Strategic Investors, raised a net Pounds 19.8m.
The fall in operating profits reflected an operating loss of Pounds 1.8m in
power transmission, which accounted for Pounds 69m of total turnover of
Pounds 201.6m (Pounds 196.6m). Fenner is negotiating to sell the division,
which traded profitably in the second half, although no announcement is
expected before the end of the year.
Mr Mark Abrahams, finance director, said yesterday that the conveyor belt
division had come through a tough year extremely well. The loss in business
to British Coal had been replaced by exports.
The fluid power division performed well in the US and the polymer business
made operating profits of Pounds 4m on turnover of Pounds 30m.
Net interest payable dipped from Pounds 3.91m to Pounds 3.62m. Net
borrowings were up from Pounds 23.2m to Pounds 26.2m. Following the rights
issue pro forma gearing was down from 54 per cent to 10 per cent.
The results also include a contribution of Pounds 635,000 from Fenner India
and Pounds 1.6m from the sale of Fenner Industrial Controls in the US.
Losses per share were 7.86p, compared with earnings of 0.1p. Excluding
exceptionals, earnings would have been 6.83p (5.08p).
