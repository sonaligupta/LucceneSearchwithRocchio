FT  13 NOV 92 / Letter: A medium-sized answer to costly legal fees


   From Mr J GOULDING


Sir, There was a phrase concerning the computer industry to the effect that
nobody had ever lost their job by buying IBM. I was reminded of it when
reading your article concerning London lawyers' fees ('Business and the
Law', November 10). I think it is accepted that for many years lawyers in
the big City firms have enjoyed substantial incomes and charged large fees.
The fault does not lie with the lawyers but with clients who have used their
services, whether or not they were the right legal animal for that
particular company or task.
As a partner in a medium-sized commercial practice, I am delighted to say
that our experience is that more and more businesses are appreciating that a
good quality legal service can be provided without going to a big City firm.
While there is no doubt that some legal tasks should be done by such
organisations, it is also clear that there is a whole range of legal
problems and needs which can be served both more efficiently and cheaply by
other legal practices.
Those that are currently moaning as to the cost of lawyers in the big City
practices should consider whether it is in the interest of themselves and
their shareholders to use the range of legal services open to them and vote
with their feet.
