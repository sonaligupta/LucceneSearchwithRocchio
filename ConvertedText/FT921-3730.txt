FT  12 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading


   By JOEL KIBAZO


NEGATIVE sentiment about Tuesday's Budget sent stock index futures tumbling,
as dealers unwound positions taken on ahead of the chancellor's statement,
writes Joel Kibazo.
A modest advance fell away as the negative mood towards the Budget took
hold, and a sharp fall was seen in the March contract, which led the cash
market down.
The announcement of the election date, together with falls in the gilts and
money markets, only served to further weaken March, sending it to trade
around its fair value premium to cash and briefly at a discount to the cash
market.
The contract eventually closed at 2,525, down 45 on the day and below its
estimated fair value premium to cash of around 4. Turnover at more than
7,000 contracts was healthy. Further falls were recorded in after-hours'
dealing, with March at one point trading at 2,512, 10 points below the
closing level of the cash market, leading to speculation of a poor opening
today.
In the LTOM, volume reached 21,886 lots, with the FT-SE 100 index option
accounting for 1,035 contracts, as dealers took to hedging positions. BT,
seen as a defensive stock, was the busiest stock option on 911 lots dealt.
