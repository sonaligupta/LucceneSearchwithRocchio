FT  20 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Abbey National upgraded


   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and PETER JOHN


THE latest upsurge in Abbey National shares was ascribed to an upgrading of
profit forecasts by BZW, the UK investment bank. The recent advance in the
stock price gathered momentum throughout yesterday and drove Abbey shares up
to an all-time record of 360p before they eased off to end the session a net
8 1/2 higher at 358 1/2 p. Turnover in the stock was 3.6m shares.
BZW lifted its current year profits forecast for Abbey from Pounds 560m to
Pounds 610m and that for next year from Pounds 680m to Pounds 710m. Mr
Philip Gibbs, the sector analyst, said the increase in the current year
estimate was made because of the windfall gains to Abbey arising from the
delay in implementing reductions in most interest rates.
The rise in next year's forecast was a reflection, Mr Gibbs said, of margins
gains which derive from the widening the differential between lending and
savings rates.
Since the flotation of Abbey National at 130p each in July 1989 the shares
have risen over 175 per cent. During the same period the FTSE-100 has risen
just over 20 per cent.
Power stocks busy
The power generators, National Power and PowerGen, continued to outperform
other utility stocks, the former rising 3.3 per cent and the latter 2.9 per
cent, following renewed aggressive buying by US securities houses.
Salomon Brothers, one of the leading US investment banks, was said by
dealers to have been the main driving force behind buying interest which saw
National Power attain a record 290p before closing a net 9 1/2 higher at
289p on turnover of 4.3m. PowerGen only just failed to break its all-time
high of 293p, and settled 8 up at 287 1/2 p after 290p on turnover of 8.7m
shares.
Mr Michael Sayers, utilities specialist at Salomon, acknowledged the buying
interest: 'We've been aggressive buyers for some time and think the shares
are outstandingly cheap.'
ICI pressured
Sellers moved in on ICI and the share price fell sharply on heavy turnover
yesterday as a result of a number of negative factors. The shares were
traded down as low as 1010p and closed a net 24 lower at 1013p with 3m
dealt.
The market focused on Smith New Court research which takes a pessimistic
view of the value of the company post demerger and suggests that the
demerger will have to be deferred anyway.
There was also growing concern about Zeneca, ICI's choice of name for the
new pharmaceutical group. One disillusioned analyst said the decision to
offload the brand loyalty associated with the ICI name amounted to
'commercial suicide'. Finally there was a knock-on effect from third-quarter
figures announced by German rival BASF, which came in below the worst
expectations.
Mirror bought
Institutions decided that the administrators of Mirror Group were making a
determined attempt to get the newspaper's finances straight and bought the
stock heavily. They were responding to enthusiastic recommendations from
Kleinwort Benson and James Capel.
Mr Guy Lamming of Capel attracted investors after pointing out the
newspapers's cash generative abilities and its relative value. At Kleinwort,
Mr Derek Terrington said: 'Effectively, there is a new board of directors
and that is a move that cannot be underestimated.' The stock was 7 higher
before profit-taking brought it down to a net gain of 4 at 83p on very large
turnover of 8.3m.
Retailer Storehouse produced well-signalled figures and the shares edged up
a penny to 186p. However, having disposed of the loss-making Richards and
Habitat brands, analysts were generally upbeat about the second half. Nomura
raised its full-year forecast Pounds 11 1/2 m to Pounds 47 1/2 m, while
County NatWest added Pounds 5m to Pounds 40m. County's Ms Kimlan Cook said:
'The figures confirm our positive stance. The more you see the more
compelling the recovery story is.'
The news that the Monopolies and Mergers Commission is investigating the
perfume market hit Boots, the shares falling 6 to 484p.
Banana exporter Geest recovered from a savage downgrade by its broker
Cazenove as the company attempted to play down the current delicate
negotiations between the European Community and the Caribbean exporters. The
shares added 5 to 254p, but could not prevent a number of other downgrades,
including BZW which lopped Pounds 2m from this year's profit forecast to
Pounds 23m.
Scottish presentations were said to have lifted Iceland Frozen Foods, up 6
at 568p. Albert Fisher was said to have been recommended by SG Warburg and
the shares gained 5 to 53p in turnover of 11m.
Evode jumped 19 to 91p after diversified manufacturer Wassall made an 80p
per share bid for the specialist seals and coatings group valuing it at
Pounds 58.2m. Wassall held to a fall of only 15 to 183p despite the pressure
of the bid and the dilutive effect of a three-for-five rights at 150p a
share.
The bid encouraged marketmakers to look around for other old takeover
candidates. Lucas ended 7 1/2 up at 120 1/2 p and Norcros improved 8 to
128p. Leigh Interests was also the subject of speculative talk and rose 15
to 186p. Speculative buying pushed Yorkshire Chemicals up 18 to 340p.
Smith & Nephew rose 3 1/2 to 162 1/2 p after Credit Lyonnais Laing
reinforced its buy recommendation on the stock.
Cable and Wireless (C and W) delighted the market with interim profits up
around 36 per cent at Pounds 378m and well ahead of the most optimistic
expectations which were around the Pounds 360m-level. The interim dividend
was also said to be at the top end of the market range. The shares raced up
to 657p before settling a net 10 higher at 652p on heavy turnover of 7.3m.
The proposed sale of up to 1.35bn shares continued to cast a shadow over
both classes of BT with the 'old' 3 off at 393p on turnover of 9m and the
partly-paid 4 1/2 down at 288p on 6.5m. Vodafone, helped by switching from
BT, rose 6 to 387p on 2.4m.
The discount houses extended their recent excellent performance with Union
Discount, involved in takeover talks with an unnamed party, closing a
further 25 up at 96p with the market looking for other potential bidders to
move in. Cater Allen, regarded as a possible bidder for Union, rose 4 to
385p after 400p, following the increased interim dividend. King & Shaxson
which recently announced a 60 per cent increase in its interim payment,
moved up 5 to 90p.
A stock shortage and hints that one of the big US investment banks was about
to release a strong buy recommendation on the stock boosted General Accident
19 to 579p. Commercial Union, one of the market's favoured composites, edged
up 4 more to 577p. CE Heath, the insurance broker, closed 11 up at 308p with
the market relieved that the dividend cut was not even bigger.
Specialist mechanical engineer Siebe performed well as Smith New Court
upgraded its recommendation on the stock to buy from hold. The house argues
that the relative rating has come back to a more attractive level. The
shares improved 10 to 360p.
Fears that NorthWest Airlines, one of the biggest customers in the
industry's order backlog, might be considering filing for bankruptcy
unsettled British Aerospace by 4 at 126p.
British Steel rebounded 2 1/2 to 50p on expectations of EC assistance to
counter over capacity.
Speculation that Forte is actively hunting a new chief executive continued
to help the shares, which put on 4 before fading to a penny better at 175p.
First results from Euro Disney confirmed the dismal speculation and the
shares tumbled 55 to 845p.
Thorn EMI's poor spell continued, the shares - which had fallen 58p in two
weeks - dropped another 12 closing at 763p. However, an afternoon rally
suggested that it may have reached the bottom of its trading range.
