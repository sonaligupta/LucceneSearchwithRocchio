FT  23 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: A guide to the lenders


   By ALISON SMITH


For information on the many organisations which operate as building
societies, a browse through the Moneyfacts Building Society Directory* is
instructive.
Covering all 84 societies, it shows the full range of the sector - from the
mighty Halifax to the small societies which lend mainly within walking
distance of their head offices.
It also includes a new feature detailing the disappearance of societies
through mergers. If you have been kept awake at nights wondering what became
of the Magnet & Planet or the Kent Reliance, this is the volume for you.
For existing societies, the directory gives year-end balance sheets along
with some other key financial statistics. Information about subsidiaries and
available banking services also is provided, along with details of auditors,
solicitors and relationships (if any) between societies and life insurance
companies.
What the book does not do is set out all the statistical information -
including addresses for each branch - to be found in the Building Societies
Yearbook (published by the Building Societies Association), or analyse how
each of the larger societies performed against its competitors (the basis of
the UBS Building Society Major Players annual survey).
Still, at Pounds 19.95, it is much cheaper than either BSA (Pounds 55 for
the latest edition) or UBS (almost Pounds 200 last year).
Perhaps next time, though, it could include the range during the year of the
rates paid to, or by, existing savers and borrowers as well as the best and
worst deals offered to new customers.
