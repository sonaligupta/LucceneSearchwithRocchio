FT  29 OCT 93 / International Company News: Oki Electric passes payout


   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO


OKI Electric, the Japanese communications equipment maker, reported a loss
of Y6.8bn (Dollars 65.6m) in the first half of the year and passed its
dividend. The company blamed its poor performance on continuing weakness in
private businesses demand and personal consumption, as well as the sharp
appreciation of the yen.
The loss came on sales of Y256. bn, 2.2 per cent down on the previous first
half. Oki's pre-tax losses were lower than last year's first-half losses of
Y19.3bn.
The company said it was able to contain losses through cost-cutting efforts.
However, the net loss of Y12.4bn was worse than its previous loss of Y8.7bn.
Oki, which has close ties with NTT, the telecommunications group, saw
substantial declines in its communications equipment and information
processing equipment divisions. This was blamed on private business moves to
cut capital spending. Strong demand for memory chips, on the other hand,
helped raise sales in its electronic devices division.
Oki is forecasting a pre-tax loss of Y8bn on sales of Y5,550bn for the full
year to March 1994.
