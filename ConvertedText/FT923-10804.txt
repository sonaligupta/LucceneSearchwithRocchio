FT  28 JUL 92 / International Company News: Boeing warns on income as
aircraft deliveries slip


   By MARTIN DICKSON


   NEW YORK


BOEING, the world's leading manufacturer of commercial aircraft, yesterday
reported flat second-quarter earnings and predicted lower income in the
second half of 1992, due to a drop in aircraft deliveries and high
development spending on its new 777 airliner.
The Seattle-based company reported earnings of Dollars 453m, or Dollars 1.33
a share, compared with Dollars 454m, or Dollars 1.32 a share, in the same
period of last year.
Sales totalled Dollars 7.82bn, compared with Dollars 7.81bn, while R&D
spending was Dollars 455m, up from Dollars 338m. Both these results and the
full-year forecasts were broadly in line with market expectations.
The company noted that although the second-quarter figures were little
changed from last year, the latest period included a significantly higher
level of R&D expense, offset by improved cost performance.
Boeing's forecast second-half dip in earnings is due in part to the soft
aircraft market, which means it is cutting its production of 737 jets from
21 to 14 a month. In addition, 34 of the 61 747 jumbo jets due for delivery
this year were handed over to customers in the first half.
Yet despite warnings from aircraft industry pessimists, Boeing's firm
backlog of orders has been holding up and totalled Dollars 91.9bn at the end
of June, compared with Dollars 92.8bn at the end of December.
The company said reduced second-half deliveries, together with high R&D
expenses, would result in lower second-half sales and earnings, although it
was still forecasting 1992 revenues of Dollars 29.5bn and R&D spending for
the year of around Dollars 1.8bn. Cash flow would be negative for the
balance of the year.
For the first six months, Boeing reported net earnings of Dollars 894m, or
Dollars 2.62 a share, on sales of Dollars 15.8bn, compared with earnings of
Dollars 763m, or Dollars 2.22 a share, on sales of Dollars 13.9bn in the
same period of last year.
