FT  15 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei under pressure as
yen reaches a further high

THE YEN'S rise to a new post-war high soured investor confidence and share
prices lost ground on futures-led selling, in the thinnest trading for three
months, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
Volume fell to 250m shares, its lowest since March 3. A total of 645.7m
shares changed hands last Friday on futures-led trading. The Nikkei average
lost 103.60 to 20,397.35 after a high of 20,560.08 in the morning session
and a low of 20,351.47 in the afternoon.
Declines led advances by 737 to 276, with 172 issues unchanged. The Topix
index of all first section stocks shed 1.58 to 1,659.46. In London the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 0.50 to 1,246.06.
The dollar closed at Y105.20, up Y1.12. Uncertainty over the effects on
corporate profits unnerved investors, who remained on the sidelines.
Meanwhile, research divisions of leading Japanese brokers revised down
profits forecasts for the current year to March due to the recent strength
of the yen.
Most forecasts, however, are based on an exchange rate of around Y110 to
Y114 to the dollar. Daiwa Research Institute said a rise of Y1 against the
dollar would depress pre-tax profits on an all-industry basis by 0.4 per
cent.
Exporters were hit by the higher yen, with Toshiba, the day's most active
issue, falling Y16 to Y714 and Hitachi dipping Y4 to Y865. However, electric
power utilities, which import fuel, were among the top gainers, the sector
rising by 1.7 per cent. Tokyo Electric Power advanced Y70 to Y3,860.
Daiei, the supermarket chain, announced that it will absorb three affiliated
retailers: Chujitsuya, listed on the Tokyo SE first section, Uneed Daiei,
listed on the second section of the Osaka SE, and the unlisted Dainaha.
Trading was suspended for the three companies.
Ichiken, a construction company belonging to the Daiei group, surged ahead
Y110 to Y1,110, and other retailers advanced on hopes of similar moves in
the industry. Matsuya appreciated Y33 to Y780.
The higher yen encouraged hopes of lower interest rates. Banks firmed on
hopes of wider profit margins, with Industrial Bank of Japan gaining Y10 at
Y3,040 and Bank of Tokyo Y40 at Y1,510.
Konami, the video game maker, climbed Y160 to a year's high of Y4,510 on
hopes of strong earnings. The com-pany's move to change the minimum trading
unit of its stock to 100 shares from 1,000 also encouraged investors.
In Osaka, the OSE average receded 151.59 to 22,934.59 in volume of 11.6m
shares.
Roundup
THE MUTED share price tone in Tokyo was mostly echoed in the Pacific Basin
region, where Hong Kong and Australia were closed for public holidays.
SINGAPORE was led down by banks and shipyards as spillover selling from last
Friday dampened trade. The Straits Times Industrial index slipped 10.42 to
1,842.63, losers including UOB Foreign, DBS Foreign, Sembawang Shipyard and
Sembawang Maritime.
Volume expanded from 227.95m to 311.18m shares. Malaysian stocks continued
to see active trading amid strong over-the-counter speculative buying in
selected issues such as Renong and Idris.
KUALA LUMPUR eased back after last Friday's high on Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad's visit to China, and the market's projection of lucrative deals for
Malaysian companies.
The KLSE composite index closed 3.13 down on the day at 743.16 after setting
an intraday all-time high of 753.54 which, as in Singapore, was reflected in
speculative activity in smaller Malaysian companies. Volume climbed from
635.9m to 808.2m shares.
SEOUL fell for the fourth consecutive session on profit-taking in thin
trading, the composite stock index weakening 6.39 to 759.47 in turn-over
down from Won644.06bn to Won596.95bn.
TAIWAN's weighted index dropped 43.87 to 4,177.20 as turnover fell to
TDollars 11.7bn, its lowest in a full session since January.
Conflict within the ruling Nationalist party ahead of local government
elections at the end of this year, and an official investigation into
irregular stock trade, continued to hurt sentiment.
KARACHI marked Pakistan's budget day with the KSE index 1.27 higher at
1,183.73, but, in BOMBAY, last week's depressive kerb trade phenomenon
continued.
Indian brokers reported no buy enquiries at all as the BSE index closed
436.36 lower at 2,357.64, and as major blue chips fell around 1 per cent
further on the kerb.
BANGKOK defied the general trend in the region, ris-ing strongly across the
board in active trade following Sat-urday's parliamentary defeat of the
opposition's motion of no confidence in the gov-ernment.
The SET index ended 15.10, or 1.8 per cent, higher at 868.24 in turnover of
Bt7.40bn, the biggest daily trade in four months.
