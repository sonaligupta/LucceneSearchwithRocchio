FT  15 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading


   By JOEL KIBAZO


A TECHNICAL squeeze in Footsie futures sent the June contract sharply ahead,
breaking out of its recent trading range ahead of its expiry on Friday,
writes Joel Kibazo.
Futures opened in a subdued mood but gathered momentum from early buying,
amid talk of a possible reduction in British base rates to follow a similar
move in France.
Although it had little in the way of firm offers, June was soon squeezed
forward, pulling the underlying cash market higher.
Producer price index figures (PPI) in line with forecasts only served to
increase demand and the contract broke through 2,900.
The day's high of 2,904 was reached just after 2pm, with sentiment boosted
by a firm UK gilts sector.
Dealers said there had been some arbitraging between the cash and futures
markets and there was also a significant amount of rolling forward into the
September contract, which takes over as the forward contract on Monday. A
strong premium to cash was maintained throughout the session.
Following a bout of profit-taking, June finished at 2,895, a 10-point
premium to cash. Volume in the contract was 11,964 lots, while just over
5,000 were dealt in the September contract.
In contrast, the traded options remained dull, with a total of 24,215 lots
dealt, compared with Friday's 26,314 contracts.
