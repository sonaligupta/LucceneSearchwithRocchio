FT  08 NOV 94 / Observer: Purse-break hotel


Observer is starting a campaign to discover which UK hotel charges the most
to make a five-minute telephone call. The award - a broken handset from a
1960s public telephone, or a bottle of malt, winning nominee to choose -
will go to the biggest proved rip-off posted or faxed in by Christmas.
Top of the list so far is the spanking new Hilton National hotel in Swindon.
A colleague was recently charged Pounds 42.50 for a 30-minute Sunday night
call to Dublin. British Telecom's weekend rate at five pence per unit -
roughly 15 seconds - would have cost about Pounds 6, and Mercury somewhat
less.
But Swindle's - sorry, Swindon's - Hilton charges 30p per unit for the first
10 units, and 25p thereafter. The hotel's general manager Ashley Myers
thought this wasn't too bad, since he understood the Manchester Airport
Hilton to charge 36p per unit. Much the same as it's better to be eaten by
lions than tigers . . .
