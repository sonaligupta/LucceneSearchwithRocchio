FT  12 APR 94 / One in 20 homes reported empty


One in 20 of all homes is empty - the highest number for a decade - says a
report by the Empty Homes Agency, published yesterday.
During the same period the number of households accepted as homeless doubled
to 142,000.
While local councils have filled more of their empty homes, the number of
empty private-sector homes has risen steadily, according to the study. It
says millions of pounds is spent each year on the maintenance, insurance and
security of empty homes, in spite of acute demand for affordable rented
accommodation.
Mr Bob Lawrence of the Empty Homes Agency said: 'These unused assets are
worth over Pounds 25bn. Bringing just 10 per cent of the 864,000 empty homes
back into use would have a very significant impact on the problems of
homelessness.'
The figures show that 764,000 private-sector homes are empty compared with
541,000 in 1983.
Councils are the least wasteful landlords, with only 1.9 per cent of their
housing stock empty, followed by housing associations with 2.4 per cent of
properties not lived in.
In contrast, 15 per cent of homes owned or supervised by government
departments are not being used. But the total standing empty - 15,800 - has
been reduced.
Worries about regaining possession, a reluctance to rent and a lack of
awareness of grants to tackle repairs have contributed to the situation.
The report calls for more publicity to be given to the benefits of assured
shorthold tenancies, and a simplification of the range of grants available.
It also says councils should develop strategies to deal with empty
properties.
