FT  23 APR 93 / World News In Brief: Italy seeks new government after
premier resigns


Italian prime minister Giuliano Amato formally resigned yesterday and was
asked to stay on as caretaker while Italy's president, Oscar Luigi Scalfaro,
searched for a new government.
In his final speech to parliament, at the end of a two-day debate on the
fate of the nine-month-old coalition cabinet, Amato said he was not a
candidate to lead Italy's 52nd government since the end of the second world
war.
