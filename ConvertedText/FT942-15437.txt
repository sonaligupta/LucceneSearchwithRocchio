FT  15 APR 94 / Fears on London rail project


   By CHARLES BATCHELOR


The proposed CrossRail project, an underground railway to provide an
east-west link under London, is ahead of its time and could not be justified
until at least 2010, a report released yesterday says, Charles Batchelor
writes.
A review of the Pounds 2bn project by the Bovis construction company and the
Sir Alexander Gibb engineering consultancy for a Commons committee concludes
that CrossRail is 'a visionary project which may be ahead of its time'. It
doubts whether CrossRail will attract sufficient private finance to make it
viable.
CrossRail and the Corporation of London said the report had been prepared in
six weeks and its authors had had to make 'major simplifications (which)
have seriously affected certain results'.
Mr Michael Cassidy, the corporation's policy chairman said: 'Railways have
to be planned to meet demand for decades, not just for the first year of
operation.'
