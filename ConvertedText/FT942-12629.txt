FT  28 APR 94 / International Company News: Leisure product sales bolster
Bombardier


   By BERNARD SIMON


Bombardier, the Canadian transport equipment maker, lifted fiscal 1994
earnings by almost a third, due chiefly to a surge in demand for its
recreational snow vehicles and water craft.
The Montreal-based company's railway rolling-stock business continues to
suffer losses from its Eurotunnel contract, though this segment is expected
to return to the black this year. The quarterly dividend has been raised to
7.5 cents from 5 cents.
Net earnings climbed to CDollars 175.6m (USDollars 127.2m), or CDollars 1.12
a share, in the year to January 31, from CDollars 132.8m, or 85 cents, in
the previous 12 months. Revenues rose to CDollars 4.77bn from CDollars
4.45bn.
Pre-tax earnings from the motorised consumer products division soared to
CDollars 76.4m from CDollars 28.6m. The sharp increase was attributed to
strong sales of the Sea-Doo (which resembles a waterborne motorcycle), a
revamped line of Ski-Doos (which is a motorcycle with skis instead of
wheels) and snow-blowers.
Aerospace income fell to CDollars 136.5m from CDollars 180.6m.
