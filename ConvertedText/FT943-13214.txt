FT  21 JUL 94 / Observer: Dog-eared


Tough luck on DPR Publishing, which today brings out the 1994 edition of the
Whitehall Companion, an invaluable 'Who's Who' for government departments
and quangos; it's already out of date. Yesterday's UK government reshuffle
means moves not just for ministers but also their advisers.
Life will certainly change for Eleanor Laing, adviser to John MacGregor,
outgoing transport secretary. The Companion discloses that she has advised
MacGregor on a diverse range of subjects; she was his aide when he was at
education and stayed by him when he was Leader of the Commons, ending up in
transport.
Cliff Grantham, special adviser to departing education secretary John
Patten, may also be casting around. A former BBC radio news reporter and
lobbyist, he also advised Patten as minister of state at the Home Office.
Peter Brooke enjoyed the services of two advisers at the Department of
National Heritage. Dominic Loehnis came from the Sunday Telegraph, but could
always turn a hand to his first calling, as a lyricist. Bryan Jefferson may
survive the change of ministers, since he brings professional skills to his
role as architectural adviser.

national heritage? Get your CVs in fast.
