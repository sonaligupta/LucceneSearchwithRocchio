FT  17 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Robert Fleming plans Czech
investment trust


   By SARA WEBB


ROBERT Fleming, the merchant banking group, is planning to launch a Dollars
100m Czechoslovakia investment trust with the backing of the European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).
The Czechoslovakia Investment Corporation will be the first closed-end
mutual fund open to foreign institutions, and will invest entirely in
Czechoslovak companies or commercial ventures, according to Robert Fleming.
The EBRD has agreed to be a leading shareholder in the investment trust,
with a view to lending to some of the companies which are selected for the
fund.
Robert Fleming has signed an agreement with Investicni Banka, the
Czechoslovak investment bank, whereby it has access to advance information
about companies seeking foreign capital. Investicni Banka is advising the
government on its privatisation programme. It already runs several domestic
mutual funds for which Robert Fleming is an adviser.
Robert Fleming has secured the right to invest on the same terms and
conditions as Investicni Banka's domestic funds.
The fund managers hope to raise more than Dollars 100m by placing units  -
each consisting of five shares and one warrant - with institutional
investors. The fund will be listed in London and in Prague once the stock
market opens there.
Several of the eastern European funds launched after the opening up of the
eastern bloc attracted considerable investor interest but faced problems
finding suitable investments.
Robert Fleming launched the Deutscheland Investment Corporation, a fund set
up for investment in eastern German concerns which is listed in London and
Berlin.
