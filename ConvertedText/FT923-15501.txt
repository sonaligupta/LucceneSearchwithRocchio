FT  02 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Sales of French luxury goods fall

THE US recession caused serious problems last year for France's luxury goods
groups. The downturn in the US market was the chief cause for a 1.5 per cent
fall in exports, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris.
The latest figures from the Comite Colbert, which represents 70 of France's
largest luxury goods companies, including Bollinger champagne, the Hotel du
Crillon and Chanel perfume, show that their combined turnover fell by 1 per
cent to FFr29.36bn (Pounds 3bn) in 1991. This decline in sales follows a
decade of uninterrupted growth. The US recession, combined with the weakness
of the dollar, created difficulties last year.
The Comite Colbert members saw their US sales fall by Dollars 89m (Pounds
48m) in 1991. This was offset by an increase in sales to Japan, which now
represents 12.2 per cent of their turnover, and to the rest of Europe.
As a result, the overall fall in exports was limited to Dollars 62m, or 1.6
per cent. Sales in France itself, still the Comite Colbert's biggest single
source of business, rose by 0.8 per cent to FFr8.7bn. In real terms this
represented a fall of 2.6 per cent in the French market.
