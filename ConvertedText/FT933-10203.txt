FT  05 AUG 93 / Observer: When bigger is better


If the staff of the Leeds Permanent Building Society think that they will
have no problem getting on with their close neighbours in Bradford then they
had better brace themselves for their first jargon lesson from the new chief
executive they are inheriting from National & Provincial.
Less well-travelled Yorkshire folk might be forgiven for thinking that N&P's
David O'Brien belongs to some sort of moonie sect.
O'Brien, 52, an ex-IBM man, has only been running N&P for three years and
for most of the time has been engrossed in a 'business re-design' programme.
Bent on replacing the functional hierarchy with a new culture based on
teamwork, O'Brien talks of a world in which staff are players, a meeting is
a team event, a task is a journey and jobs have become roles.
When O'Brien takes his new seat on the direction management team - sorry,
board - of what will be one of Britain's top three building societies, one
of his first challenges will be to explain how the latest move squares with
his earlier thoughts on the subject of size.
'To think business is about acquiring other people is missing the whole
point,' he told the FT a few months ago. He was at pains to clarify this
yesterday, insisting that the new society would be a merger of equals, not
an acquisition. But there was little sign of him dropping his new-fangled
ideas. Far from retreating, he said the new Leeds would be 'driven to' a
similar approach by having to merge managements.
