FT  29 APR 94 / Observer: Hot air


It has not taken British Gas's new chairman Richard Giordano long to get
into the swing.
Giordano arrived too late to have the pleasure of jousting with Sir James
McKinnon, Clare Spottiswoode's combative predecessor at Ofgas, but he
certainly seems to have inherited a dose of the corporate hostility towards
the man.
When a shareholder at yesterday's agm raised the subject of McKinnon's
appearance on the board of rival gas company Calor, he admitted to sharing
the questioner's outrage.
But then, the benefit of McKinnon's knowledge of gas would not necessarily
get Calor all that far. 'Some of us did not think it very high,' he
remarked.
