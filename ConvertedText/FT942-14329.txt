FT  21 APR 94 / Economic Watch: German industry optimistic


The Federation of German Industry, encouraged by an apparent improving trend
in factory orders, has revised its forecasts for growth in western Germany
this year. Mr Tyll Necker, president of the influential BDI industry group,
said he now expected west German gross domestic product to rise by 1 per
cent in 1994, compared with earlier forecasts of a 0.5 per cent rise. In
eastern Germany, Mr Necker said that growth forecasts of between 6 and 8 per
cent were 'thoroughly realistic'.
The Bundesbank announced yesterday a sharper-than-expected decline in its
securities repurchase rate - a key marker for German money market interest
rates. The central bank said the rate had fallen to 5.58 per cent from 5.70
a week ago, well above market forecasts.
Belgium's fiscal revenues rose in the first quarter of 1994 by 16.4 per cent
to BFr433bn (Pounds 8.4bn) from BFr37bn in the first quarter of 1993. In
March they were up 11.5 per cent to BFr148m compared with BFr132m in March
last year, the Finance Ministry said.
Swedish retail sales fell 2.4 per cent in February compared with February
1993 after a 0.5 per cent increase in January, the national statistics
agency said yesterday.
