FT  08 NOV 93 / Arts: Today's Television


   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY


One of the day's most promising programmes is also one of the shortest.
Lasting just five minutes, American Trilogy (BBC2, 7.25) is the first in a
series running through the week, each programme featuring three works from
the Royal Academy exhibition 'American Art In The 20th Century'.
Will Fitz make love to his wife? Or to Det. Sgt. Penhaligon? Will his
brinkmanship finally lead to someone's death? It is an indication of the
rapid success of ITV's new crime series that millions of viewers will know
that these questions refer to Robbie Coltrane's weird police psychologist in
the excellent Cracker (ITV, 9.00).
Years ago a high ranking member of the fire service told me that more
arsonists worked in fire brigades than in any other job. It will be
interesting to see whether this comes out in C4's Cutting Edge (9.00),
devoted to the arson investigators of the London Fire Brigade.
If you don't enjoy the programme about fire you can switch over to one about
water in Panorama (BBC1, 9.30) which investigates water meters and rapidly
increasing water rates.
