Hitachi will sell Macintosh personal computers made by Apple of the US as
part of its client-server systems, the Japanese electronics group said

Hitachi will buy the PCs from Canon Sales, a subsidiary of the camera and
office equipment maker which is one of Apple's main distributors in Japan.
Canon Sales for its part will sell Hitachi's workstations and servers.
A server is the master computer in a PC network which stores and provides
