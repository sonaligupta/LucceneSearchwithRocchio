FT  27 MAY 93 / Observer: Choked off


Not even a police escort was enough to get German foreign office mandarin
Dieter Kastrup to his desk through yesterday's left-wing demonstration in
Bonn against the tightening-up of asylum laws. His car was spotted and
forced into a side street under a hail of stones.
So he decided to smuggle himself into work under what, for a bureaucrat, is
a deep disguise. He took off his tie, and strolled casually up to the door.
The trouble was that the attendant took one look at his open collar, and
refused to let him in.
Fortunately his repeated claims to being state secretary led to the
summoning of security guards who, after demanding to see his identity card,
let him pass. Whereupon, of course, he replaced his tie.
