FT  05 NOV 93 / International Company News: London SE issues leaks guidance


   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent


THE London Stock Exchange yesterday issued proposed guidance intended to
curb the selective leaking of price-sensitive information to market
participants which can give rise to insider dealing.
However, the guidance stops well short of either defining price-sensitive
information or requiring quarterly financial reporting, two measures sought
by investor groups.
Requirements for unaudited quarterly reporting were also supported by many
members of the Exchange's own Large Companies Advisory Committee,
particularly those whose shares are traded on US exchanges and have coped
easily with quarterly reporting requirements there.
The guidance is the result of efforts begun in late summer, in conjunction
with the 100 Group of Finance Directors and shareholder and industry analyst
associations. The move followed the exchange's first-ever censure of a
traded company, LIG, for telling a group of analysts about its financial
condition and concerns about the nature of insider dealing rules contained
in the new criminal justice bill.
Shareholders have urged more frequent public reporting, saying the longer
price-sensitive information is kept inside the company the greater the
opportunity for individuals to profit from public ignorance.
