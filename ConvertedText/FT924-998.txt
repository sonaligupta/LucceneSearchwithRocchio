FT  21 DEC 92 / Opposition parties back De Klerk purge


   By PHILIP GAWITH

THE purge by President F W de Klerk of South African Defence Force members
involved in efforts to undermine the reform process has been welcomed by
other political parties, who believe further revelations are likely to
follow.
Mr de Klerk's announcement on Saturday that 23 SADF members, including two
generals and four brigadiers, had either been compulsorily retired or
suspended, is the largest reshuffle in defence force ranks since the first
world war.
The two generals sacked have been named by the Afrikaans Sunday newspaper
Rapport as Gen Hennie Roux, army chief of staff, and Gen Chris Thirion,
deputy chief of staff intelligence. Also alleged to have been sacked are
Brig Tolletjies Botha, head of the Directorate of Covert Collection (DCC),
and Brigadier Ferdi van Wyk, the mastermind behind a campaign to discredit
the African National Congress.
The ANC welcomed Mr de Klerk's announcement, but said 'It has been a very
slow recognition of what is happening.' Gen Bob Rogers, Democratic Party
spokesman on defence commended Mr de Klerk for his prompt action.
The recent upsurge in attacks on whites continued over the weekend when a
14-year-old girl was killed in a grenade attack on a farm near the Lesotho
border.
