expenses, down to Dollars 2.07bn from Dollars 2.08bn.
Second-quarter operating profits rose to Dollars 207.8m from Dollars 19.2m.

Dollars 2.42.
For the six months to June, the company reported a turnround to profits of
Dollars 89.6m from losses of Dollars 236.5m.
The company said this was the first time it had reported four consecutive
quarters of net profits since 1989.
Southwest Airlines, the low-cost US carrier that has expanded rapidly by
undercutting other airlines' fares, yesterday reported a 38 per cent
increase in net income to Dollars 58.5m from Dollars 42.1m for the second
