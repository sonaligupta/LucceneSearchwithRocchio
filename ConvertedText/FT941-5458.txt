FT  07 MAR 94 / Fyodorov predicts action by Yeltsin


   By MARTIN WOLF


Russian president Boris Yeltsin would use his extensive presidential powers
to rescue the economy if the inflation rate accelerated out of control, Mr
Boris Fyodorov, the former minister of finance, has predicted.
Suggesting that inflation would rise to 30 per cent a month by the autumn,
rather than the 10 per cent targeted by the government, Mr Fyodorov
indicated that the outcome would probably be a return to reformist
government.
Mr Fyodorov, speaking in London on Friday, said he did not believe in a
disaster scenario, since Mr Yeltsin would take a grip of things. The future
for Russia was going to be one of muddling through, not one in which an
extremist 'clown' took power.
However, in a country of 'geniuses and future presidents' it was difficult
to obtain co-operation among reformers, he said. His own December 12 group
could co-operate with Mr Yegor Gaidar on virtually all issues. He would also
co-operate with Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, a presidential candidate, if possible.
But there were a dozen people in Russia's Choice with whom he would find it
difficult to work.
Nevertheless, the former finance minister was worried about the political
confrontation looming between president and parliament.
Unrest might come to a head with demonstrations on May 1, which would have
to be firmly handled by the authorities in Moscow.
