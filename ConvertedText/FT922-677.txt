FT  26 JUN 92 / International Company News: Opel expects further fall in
profits after 19% decline

OPEL, the German subsidiary of General Motors of the US, expects a further
drop in profits during 1992 after a 19 per cent decline in net income last
year to DM1.1bn (Dollars 687m), said Mr Gail Gunderson, the finance
director.
This year's earnings decline will reflect the shift in business away from
the domestic market, where the post-unification car sales boom has tailed
off, to export markets where margins are lower, he added.
In 1991, Opel raised turnover by 14 per cent to DM27bn. Because of the model
switch from the Kadett to the new Astra family car, however, production was
5 per cent lower at 995,000 units. This was one factor holding down profits,
with model start-up costs some DM300m higher than in 1990.
Opel also had to write off DM450m of the value of its investment in Saab,
the Swedish automotive company in which GM took a 50 per cent stake and
management control in 1989. In addition, Opel added to its pension reserves
and bore an initial DM125m loss through the acquisition of its east German
site in Eisenach where its new car plant will open in September.
To meet rising demand in Germany last year, Opel imported 228,000 vehicles
from GM plants in the UK and Spain, a move which also eroded profits. Thus
its total unit sales rose by 6 per cent to 1.2m cars, with a 27 per cent
jump in Germany to 758,000 and a 16.5 per cent decline abroad to 464,000.
This year, however, almost half of Opel's vehicles will be sold in export
markets against 38 per cent in 1991. 'We are selling more cars at lower
profit outside (Germany) and fewer cars at higher prices inside,' Mr
Gunderson said.
Mr Louis Hughes, the chief executive who has just been appointed president
of General Motors Europe, said Opel's output in the first five months of
1992 had risen by 3.3 per cent to 590,000 cars. The target for the full year
was more than 1.1m cars, a rise of 12 per cent, reflecting higher production
capacity for the new Astra.
He stressed the need to bring down costs and raise productivity at Opel,
saying the negative factors on the German industrial scene had reached 'a
dangerous level'. But he gave no further details of Opel's talks with unions
to reduce labour, especially at its main Russelsheim plant near Frankfurt.
