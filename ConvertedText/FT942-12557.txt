FT  29 APR 94 / Conservatives dominate Hata's ministerial team: Surprise
appointment of recent LDP defector


   By WILLIAM DAWKINS


   TOKYO


Mr Tsutomu Hata, Japan's new prime minister, yesterday produced a
conservative-dominated minority cabinet, unlikely to last more than a few
months in the absence of his former socialist allies.
Japan's new administration will bring little change to the former Hosokawa
government's policies of economic deregulation, tax and political reform,
the search for a solution to the US trade dispute and a commitment to follow
any United Nations action against North Korea, according to the new team
members' first pronounce-ments.
The line-up is dominated by the partnership of the Japan Renewal party and
the Buddhist-backed Komeito clean government party, which together hold 14
of 21 cabinet seats. Of the top jobs, the prime ministership, the chief
cabinet secretary's job plus the finance, international trade and industry
and home affairs ministries are held by Mr Hata's own JRP, with eight
cabinet posts.
One surprise is the appointment of Mr Koji Kakizawa, who defected from the
Liberal Democratic party only last week, as foreign minister, the job Mr
Hata held in the last government. Mr Kakizawa - who is respected for running
the foreign ministry well as deputy to an ailing Mr Michio Watanabe, former
foreign minister - is a keen advocate of Japanese full time membership of
the United Nations Security Council.
The line-up otherwise reflects the weight of JRP and Komeito in a diminished
coalition. Only five parties are represented in the new cabinet, following
the walk-out of the Social Democratic party on Tuesday, over the formation
of a centre-right voting bloc, called Kaishin, or Innovation. Four members
of the old cabinet keep the same jobs.
Mr Hata, Japan's sixth prime minister in the past seven years, is thought
likely to last even less long than his predecessor, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa,
who held on for eight months.
The SDP has promised to help him put this year's budget through parliament,
but has warned that it might call a vote of no confidence afterwards.
According to Japanese news reports, the SDP is about to launch an inquiry
into the finances of Mr Ichiro Ozawa, Mr Hata's political mentor, deputy
leader of the JRP and an influence in the birth of Kaishin.
For the time being, Mr Hata aims to bring as much normality to government as
possible with the first minority administration since that of Mr Ichiro
Hatoyama in 1955, and the weakest in post-war history.
With the cabinet now in place, Mr Hata's first important official task is
likely to be a visit to Italy, France and Germany next week. The tour,
during a a Japanese holiday period, was originally scheduled for Mr
Hosokawa, was intended to cement European relations before the group of
seven summit in Naples in July.
On his return, Mr Hata plans to deliver his first policy speech to
parliament on May 10, paving the way for debate on the budget, to beginning
in mid-May.
The government agreed to a stop-gap budget from the beginning of the fiscal
year in April, after the opposition boycotted proceedings to put pressure on
Mr Hosokawa to come clean over the financial allegations which eventually
brought his resignation on April 8.
Final agreement on the budget will take a some weeks, so most analysts are
bargaining that the next round in Japan's internal political battles will
take place some time in June, possibly leading to an election.
