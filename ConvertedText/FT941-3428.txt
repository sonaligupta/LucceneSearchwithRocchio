FT  16 MAR 94 / Wolseley shares soar on 83% rise


   By DAVID BLACKWELL


Shares in Wolseley, the world's biggest supplier of heating and plumbing
equipment, soared by 69p to 971p yesterday as the group again surprised the
City with a sharp rise in profits. Pre-tax profits for the six months to
January 31 rose 83 per cent from Pounds 47.6m to Pounds 87m. Analysts had
expected Pounds 70m.
Mr Jeremy Lancaster, chairman and managing director, attributed the rise to
increased activity in building distribution in the UK and US, coupled with
the contributions from acquisitions. He said the company continued to apply
best practice, adding: 'If you have a formula that seems to work, then it
seems advisable to press on.'
Turnover rose from Pounds 1.15bn to Pounds 1.54bn, including Pounds 92.5m
from acquisitions.
The contribution from Erb Lumber, a US distributor of lumber and associated
products bought for Pounds 51.1m last August, had exceeded expectations. Erb
accounted for most of the Pounds 4.67m contribution by acquisitions to total
US building distribution trading profit of Pounds 34.8m, up from Pounds
18.3m. US profits included a Pounds 4.3m currency gain.
Turnover from continuing US operations advanced from Pounds 542.4m to Pounds
710.6m. Sales at Familian in California were static, but its trading loss
was 'close to being eliminated'.
But Wolseley warned that as the US house building recovery had started by
July last year, it was 'most unlikely' that the rate of growth would be
maintained in the second half.
Turnover for building distribution in Europe rose from Pounds 482.2m to
Pounds 549.4m. Trading profits increased from Pounds 22.8m to Pounds 35m.
The group said UK sales were 12 per cent ahead while Brossette, the French
arm, had raised sales by 7 per cent.
European manufacturing and other activities raised turnover from Pounds
120.4m to Pounds 190.5m. The division's trading profits jumped from Pounds
51.8m to Pounds 88.7m, including a contribution of Pounds 7.5m from
Enertech, the Swedish oil and gas burner manufacturer acquired last April.
At the end of the half, the group had a 'small positive cash balance',
mainly from the Pounds 55m raised by last August's share placing. Earnings
per share were 72 per cent ahead at 22.09p (12.86p), and the interim
dividend was raised from 3.55p to 4.72p.
