FT  26 MAY 93 / International Company News: Esselte down but sees recovery

ESSELTE, the Swedish office products group, yesterday reported profits after
financial items down 23 per cent to SKr114m (Dollars 15.61m) in the first
four months, compared with SKr149m in the corresponding period last year.
The group was hit by the economic slowdown in leading European markets, with
sales in some countries falling by as much as 15 per cent.
But Esselte said it still expected full-year profits to be ahead of last
year's SKr259m, due to the heavy currency losses and non-recurring
rationalisation charges which held back 1992 performance.
Preliminary figures for the first four months showed sales 14 per cent ahead
of last year's SKr3.34bn at SKr3.81bn. But the company said the real
comparable result was a fall of 6 per cent after the effects of last
autumn's heavy devaluation of the Swedish kronor was taken into account.
A bright spot was an upturn in the US and Canada, which account for 27 per
cent of group turnover. But there were declines in sales of up to 15 per
cent in leading markets, such as France and Spain, and 'a big question mark'
hung-over performance in Germany, the company added.
The group, which once employed more than 17,000 people, continued to shrink,
with the number of employees declining to 11,682 by the end of April.
'We are confident now that we have control over our costs. If the market
continues to go down, we can cut further, but when it goes up we believe we
are set to increase our market share,' the spokesman said.
