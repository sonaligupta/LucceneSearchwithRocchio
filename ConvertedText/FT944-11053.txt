FT  08 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Sweden


The prospect of a No vote in Sunday's EU-membership referendum has come as a
nasty shock to Sweden's markets. Increasing confidence in the government's
determination to tackle its budget deficit made Sweden the best performing
government bond market in October. But in the past few days the spread
between German and Swedish 10-year bonds has widened by almost 100 basis
points as a series of polls have pointed to a No vote.
Sentiment was not helped by last week's deficit reduction package which
leaves a good deal to do, even if one believes all the assumptions. Since
one of these is a big reduction in interest rates by the end of next year,
the bond market was not impressed. Nor are floating voters persuaded by the
government's warning that a No vote will require sterner measures.
Though Swedish business has campaigned for a Yes vote, it is unclear how
great the cost of non-membership would be on its highly international
leading companies. A No vote would hit the krona, if only on the expectation
that inward investment would dry up, which would further enhance the
competitiveness of Swedish manufacturing. But the currency risk will
discourage international investors. Swedish shares are not particularly
cheap anyway. Buyers of bonds also risk further losses with a No vote not
yet fully discounted. The yield spread against bunds is still narrower than
for Italy, whose public finances are in scarcely worse shape than Sweden's.
