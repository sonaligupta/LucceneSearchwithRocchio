FT  11 NOV 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries show strong gains after
producer data

   NEW YORK, LONDON, FRANKFURT


US TREASURY prices posted strong gains yesterday on a better-than-expected
producer prices figure and a reasonably successful afternoon auction of
Dollars 11.25bn in new 10-year notes.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  23/32 at 95
1/32 , to carry a yield of 7.670 per cent. The two-year note was also
firmer, up  1/8 at 99 9/16 , yielding 4.467 per cent.
Prices opened firmer after the Labor department reported that the producer
price index rose just 0.1 per cent in October, or fell 0.1 per cent
excluding the volatile food and energy components. Analysts had been
expecting the index to rise 0.3 per cent, and the news quickly spurred
buying of longer-dated securities, traditionally the most
inflation-sensitive sector of the market.
Securities at both ends of the maturity spectrum added to their early gains
after the 10-year auction was completed. The issue was sold at an average
yield of 6.93 per cent amid solid demand from retail and institutional
investors.
HOPES of an interest rate cut continued to sustain the UK government bond
market, with gilts gaining up to a quarter of a point on the day.
The Liffe gilt futures contract rose from 101.24 at the opening to 102.09 by
late afternoon, but dealers said volumes were relatively low ahead of the
Chancellor's Autumn Statement tomorrow. 'A lot of people are just biding
their time ahead of the statement,' said one dealer.
The market opened on a weak note following press reports that Mr Norman
Lamont, the Chancellor, does not intend to cut interest rates by as much as
2 percentage points.
The gilt market had been expecting a cut of between 1.0 and 2.0 percentage
points. The news initially led to a fall in gilt prices, although the market
later recovered to end unchanged at the short end and firmer at the long
end.
The 9 3/4 per cent gilt due 2002 rose from 111 11/32 to 111 9/16 to yield
8.01 per cent.
GERMAN government bonds closed towards the high end of a narrow trading
range, with the Liffe bund future ending unchanged on the day at 91.56.
Dealers said the market remained unperturbed by the finance ministry's
announcement yesterday, when it cut its forecast for west German economic
growth in 1993.
The ministry said west German GNP would grow by a nominal 4.2 per cent in
1993, although dealers warned that the forecast is generally seen at the top
end of the market's expectations.
The ministry added that tax revenue would be lower than expected, which
dealers expect will mean increased borrowing in the bund market.
AP-DJ adds from Frankfurt: Foreign investors bought a record DM34bn of bonds
in September, the Deutsche Bundesbank, the German central bank, has
revealed.
The strong flow of funds into the D-Mark during the European currency crisis
in September was cited as the main reason behind the massive shifts.
'In full, long-term capital imports climbed from DM9.5bn in August to
DM32.1bn in September,' the Bundesbank said.
Most of those funds flowed into the German bond market. 'Foreign investors
in September acquired a net DM34m of domestic fixed interest-rate
securities; most of that (nearly DM27bn) was public government bonds,' the
Bundesbank said. In August, foreigners bought a net DM12.19bn in domestic
bonds.
By contrast, only a net DM1bn flowed into equities in September. At the same
time, German investors sold their foreign securities in September, leading
to a net import of DM2.3bn in the month in total securities.
JAPANESE government bonds continued Monday's strong rally, but profit-taking
later yesterday wiped out some of the gains and the market closed lower.
The futures contract opened at 107.90, the high of the day, but fell to
close at 107.74. In the cash market, the yield on the benchmark No 145
opened at 4.645 per cent and moved to end at 4.665 per cent.
