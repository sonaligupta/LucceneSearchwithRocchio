FT  27 OCT 92 / KIO's activities in Spain to be probed


   By PETER BRUCE and REUTER


   MADRID, KUWAIT


THE KUWAITI government yesterday ordered the country's prosecutor general to
open an investigation into the management of some Dollars 4bn (Pounds
2.35bn) invested in Spain by the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) since the
mid-eighties.
Mr Nasser Abdulla al-Rodhan, the Kuwaiti finance minister, told the official
KUNA news agency the probe had been ordered after the KIO's new management
in London had detected 'improprieties' in the handling of Kuwaiti funds in
Spain.
The new KIO management has accused its predecessors of having invested
recklessly in Spain. Two big affiliates, the Ercros chemicals business and
the Prima property group, are close to total collapse.
The KIO's investments in Spain became one of the main issues in elections in
Kuwait earlier this month. In June, the Kuwaiti government asked the KIO's
auditors, KPMG Peat Marwick, and its lawyers, to investigate the actions of
the former management at the KIO and Grupo Torras.
The involvement of the prosecutor general may mean any parallel
investigations will stop. Neither was it clear to whom the prosecutor
general will give his findings.
It is possible he will report only to the prime minister and crown prince,
Sheikh Saad al-Abdulla al-Sabah, the Emir's brother.
Kuwait plans to privatise its telecommunications services, a communications
ministry source said yesterday, Reuter reports from Kuwait.
