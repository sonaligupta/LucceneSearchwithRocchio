FT  29 JAN 92 / International Equity Issues: Burlington Industries announces
IPO


   By SARA WEBB


US COMPANIES continue to dominate the international equity markets as those
groups which became heavily indebted as a result of leveraged buy-outs in
the 1980s are now turning to the equity markets again with initial public
offerings (IPOs).
The largest IPO to be announced recently is a Dollars 855m deal for
Burlington Industries. Morgan Stanley, which took the textile group private
five years ago, is now lead manager for the IPO.
Two other IPOs which have been filed are for the conglomerate Coltec, which
hopes to raise about Dollars 500m, and Foodmaker, the US fast food chain,
which is seeking Dollars 210m.
Further Percs - or preference equity redemption cumulative stock - issues
are expected from the US with Tandy and MaCaw expecting to raise about
Dollars 400m and Dollars 350m respectively.
Percs offer investors a high yield in return for limited capital gain.
Outside the US, attention is focusing on Istituto Bancario San Paolo di
Torino, the Italian banking group which is due to tap the markets for an
estimated Dollars 1.25bn to Dollars 1.5bn IPO soon, representing one of the
largest issues scheduled for the European markets so far this year.
About 40 per cent of the equity issue will be offered to international
investors, predominantly in Europe.
Mediobanca, the Milan-based merchant bank, is the lead manager with S. G.
Warburg and Hambros managing the offering in the UK, Indosuez managing the
offering in France, and Salomon Brothers the US portion.
San Paolo will be the second bank to take advantage of the new Amato Law,
under which public-sector banks can float up to 49 per cent of their
ordinary shares.
Banco di Napoli launched the first deal of its kind last year, raising
L400bn.
