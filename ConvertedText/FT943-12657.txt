FT  23 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Cadbury downgrade


Soft drinks and confectionery group Cadbury Schweppes was weak again as
concerns over strategy were compounded by a downgrade by Lehman Brothers.
The US broking house lopped Pounds 21m from its 1994 estimate to Pounds
449m, and Pounds 60m from its following year forecast to Pounds 463m. One of
its key concerns is tough competition in the US soft drinks market where the
threat from private label suppliers has forced the market leaders to make
big price cuts. With such known names as Canada's Cott - one of North
America's biggest private label cola producers - moving into the UK, Lehman
believes a price war here is highly likely.
Cadbury also continued to be undermined by worries over its 25 per cent
stake in Dr Pepper, the US soft drinks group. Observers are growing
increasingly concerned that Cadbury will be unsuccessful in its attempts to
either gain board representation and greater co-operation, or a full
takeover. Cadbury shares slid 5 to 434p on moderate turnover of 2m.
Building materials stocks were in demand, with Credit Lyonnais Laing adding
its support as it recommended an 'overweight' stance. The broker said that
an increase in new housebuilding was stimulating materials demand and price
rises were being sustained in a variety of goods. BPB gained 10 to 343p,
Blue Circle 8 to 322p, Marley 11 to 166p, and Wolsely 13 to 823p.
Composite insurer Commercial Union tumbled 11 to 542p as the market
nervously awaited the much-heralded rights issue which is anticipated ahead
of the interim figures scheduled for August 10. Analysts believe the insurer
will bring its figures forward and announce them with a Pounds 325m cash
call, possibly as soon as next week.
Reuters Holdings continued under pressure from some heavy selling by one US
house, believed to be Goldman Sachs. The shares were down for much of the
day and closed only a penny firmer at 468p with turnover exceptionally high
at 10m shares.
Wellcome gained 29p at 634 after the market took stock of Thursday's
slightly confusing interim results, which had been prompted by a shift in
the pharmaceutical company's account year. On consideration investors
decided that the high exceptional charge and slowdown in Retrovir sales were
more than countered by the rise in overall profits and the pick-up in
Zovirax sales. The shares bounced 29 to 634p with the help of a couple of
broker recommendations.
ICI, the country's largest chemicals group, rose 19 to 837p as the market
grew increasingly optimistic over the prospects for second-quarter results
on Thursday. The shares were also buoyed by figures from German group Bayer
which predicted it would reach its target of a 15 to 20 per cent rise in
profits for the year.
Shell Transport shares approached their all-time high in response to hopes
of an early conclusion to the sale of its Billiton metals business. But the
stock moved back from its high on reports that the Nigerian oil workers
negotiations had reached deadlock and closed 6 better at 742p.
Bank stocks gained ground ahead of the interim reporting season which begins
next week. LLoyds, which is the first to report on July 29, rose 3 to 560p,
Abbey National, which declares on August 1, gained 9 to 408p and National
Westminster, which reports the following day rose 8 to 464p.
British Airways was said to have been helped by a recommendation from SG
Warburg. The shares climbed 4 to 435p.
Good UK car production figures stimulated rises in related stocks. Among
component suppliers, GKN gained 8 to 624p, Avon Rubber 10 to 600p, Laird 11
to 403p and T&N 6 to 242p. Among distributors, Cowie added 5 to 282p, Lex
Service 5 to 464p and Inchcape 3 to 459p.
News from the US that DIY giant Home Depot had distanced itself from
entering the crowded UK market brought some respite to the beleaguered
sector. Kingfisher, under pressure following news that Home Depot had hired
a former B&Q executive to spearhead its European expansion, rallied 8 to
509p. Texas owner Ladbroke gained 5 to 174p, while Do It All parents Boots
and WH Smith climbed 5 to 527p and steadied at 473p respectively.
Salibury-based brewer Gibbs Mew announced a Pounds 12.8m deal to buy nearly
200 pubs and a Pounds 13.6m two-for-three rights issue at 340p a share. The
company also announced a tripling of full-year profits to Pounds 3.1m. The
shares retreated 27 to 391p.
Granada was again under a cloud following this week's director's share sale,
the stock slipping a half-penny to 532p.
More bear stories circulating around Wembley saw the shares slump 3 to 7 1/2
p, although turnover was only 63,000. The company confirmed that it would
not pay a dividend on its convertible preference shares.
