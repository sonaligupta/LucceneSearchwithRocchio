FT  11 APR 92 / Letter: No-win on the concert front


   From Mr NICHOLAS SNOWMAN


Sir, I was mystified by Max Loppert's claim that the London concert season
in recent years has become 'a good deal less rich in term of novelty . . .
variety and chance-taking' ('Musical jewels in tawdry settings', March 28).
It seems but yesterday that the South Bank Centre in particular was being
berated for precisely such adventurous 'chance-taking' programming. We did,
after all, put on for the first time every, anywhere, the complete works of
Schoenberg and introduced to London the first substantial appraisals of
Elliott Carter, Szymanowski, Ligeti, Maxwell Davies and others, as well as
our 'Brave New Worlds' modernism festival.
I feel in a no-win situation. Help] Where do we go next?
