FT  12 NOV 92 / Germany to boost aid for shipbuilders

GERMANY'S governing coalition parties yesterday agreed on sharply increased
subsidies for the country's shipbuilders, in spite of drastic efforts to
curb next year's spending and reduce state aids to industry.
The move, which would virtually double the amount spent on directly
subsidising orders, from DM67m (Pounds 27.6m) to DM126.4m next year,
coincided with a new report highlighting the failure of the government to
cut subsidies to industry, agriculture and mining in the past decade.
The report by the DIW economics research institute in Berlin shows the
combined total of state aids and tax allowances to enterprises in west
Germany rose from DM61bn in 1980 to DM88.4bn in 1991, with a slight
reduction expected this year to DM86.4bn.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl came to office with the 'urgent aim' of curbing state
aids, the report says. 'Its implementation ran into considerable resistance.
Hardly any concrete savings were achieved.'
In spite of the dramatic increase in demands for subsidies to eastern
Germany, and the ever more urgent need to reduce subsidies in the west,
'there is still no concept for a systematic dismantling of subsidies,' it
says.
In 1990, the per capita level of subsidies in the coal industry reached
DM52,753, in aerospace DM22,383, on the railways DM35,344, and in
shipbuilding DM16,800, the report shows. Agriculture, which enjoys subsidies
both from the German national budget, and from the European Community, was
next highest with DM14,879 per head.
The DIW suggests that the per capita subsidy in coal mining is now so high
that it would be cheaper to promote alternative jobs in other sectors for
coal miners.
EC commissioners yesterday debated plans to scale back European coal
subsidies and adjust state aid to German mines. A decision could be taken
before the end of the month, but member states are unlikely to be able to
approve the new subsidy system before next year. The existing framework for
aid to coal producers expires at the end of 1993. Germany's DAG white-collar
union yesterday rejected a 3.4 per cent pay offer to 230,000 insurance
workers, and threatened employers with 'spontaneous' warning strikes later
this month, Christopher Parkes writes from Frankfurt.
The first signs of strife in the latest pay round emerged after insurance
companies presented a proposal for a 16-month deal which the union claimed
was worth 2.7 per cent a year at best. The DAG had asked for 7.5 per cent
across-the-board.
IG Metall, the country's biggest union has started negotiations on a similar
demand on behalf of steelworkers.
