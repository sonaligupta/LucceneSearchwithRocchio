FT  20 APR 91 / UK Company News: Second store in Spain for M and S


   By JOHN ELLIOTT


Marks and Spencer is to open its second store in Spain in the city of
Seville. It will replace an existing three-storey Simago store which has
been sold to M and S for the equivalent of Dollars 20m (Pounds 11.52m) by
Dairy Farm Espana, a wholly owned subsidiary of Dairy Farm International,
the food retailing and manufacturing arm of Hong Kong's Jardine Matheson
group, writes John Elliott.
Dairy Farm bought the loss-making Simago chain last May for Dollars 126m
cash and set up Dairy Farm Espana. The Seville sale marks the start of a
rationalisation programme of surplus stores and property. The company said
yesterday that the Dollars 20m price was in line with a property valuation
last May.
