FT  19 MAY 92 / Observer: Underground fan


Prospects may look bleak for Olympia & York, but they could be worse. Take
the Jubilee line extension, for example. Notwithstanding the government's
tough public stance, the chances of it finding the Pounds 400m that O & Y
was supposed to contribute to the cost of the project are pretty high.
One reason lies in Westminster tube station, which would need to be adapted
as part of the extension. Plans for new suites of offices for MPs on top of
the tube station are governed by the proposed changes to it; a decision to
abandon the extension would mean going back to the drawing board.
By the most optimistic estimate the offices will not be ready for use until
1997, and a motion complaining about working conditions for MPs and staff
has already attracted support from 110 MPs, O&Y may find it has more friends
at court than it expected.
