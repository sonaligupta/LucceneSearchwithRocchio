FT  29 JUL 92 / International Company News: Canadian carriers resume merger
talks


   By ROBERT GIBBENS


CANADA'S two major airlines are resuming merger talks with federal
government approval.
Both Air Canada, privatised two years ago, and Canadian Airlines
International, owned by PWA Corporation of Calgary, took heavy losses in the
first half this year and both are staggering under big debt loads.
They broke off merger talks late last year with acrimony, each saying it
would do better linking up with American carriers to achieve greater access
to the US market.
However, PWA says its lengthy talks with AMR, parent of American Airlines
for an alliance have been terminated. British Airways' acquisition of 21 per
cent of USAir for USDollars 750m last week effectively ended Air Canada's
flirtation with the American carrier.
Air Canada chairman, Mr Claude Taylor, said: 'Powerful market forces compel
carriers to consider all their options and the existing structure of the
Canadian airline industry is not viable.'
He said the merger talks with PWA would resume this week, and Ottawa 'will
be monitoring them closely'.
