FT  13 APR 92 / Farm subsidies accord urged


   By FRANCES WILLIAMS


   GENEVA


FURTHER progress is not possible in negotiations on tariff cuts and services
liberalisation in the Uruguay Round of global trade talks without a
breakthrough on farm subsidies, Mr Arthur Dunkel, director-general of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), will tell negotiators today.
US and EC negotiators will meet again this week when Brussels is expected to
put forward new proposals for a farm subsidy accord.
This has raised hopes that agreement could be finalised at an April 22
meeting in Washington between President George Bush, Mr Jacques Delors,
president of the EC Commission, and Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, the prime
minister of Portugal, which holds the EC presidency.
Mr Bush said last week that he was more optimistic about a deal, having
learnt that Mr Delors considered the two sides 'very, very close'.
Though the Easter deadline for completion of the 108-nation Round will be
missed, trade officials hope that, if the US and EC can settle their
differences over farm trade reform by the end of April, other outstanding
differences and technical details of the Uruguay Round agreement could be
settled in two months.
This would allow completion of the Round before the end of June.
