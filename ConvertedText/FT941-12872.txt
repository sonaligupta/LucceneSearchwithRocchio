FT  28 JAN 94 / Sweden stops aid for ANC after 20 years

Sweden yesterday ended 20 years of financial backing for the African
National Congress. Funding from Sweden had previously accounted for up to 40
per cent of the South African group's budget, according to Swedish
officials.
The right-centre coalition government of Mr Carl Bildt last year decided to
stop the aid flow which had been started in the early 1970s by a Social
Democratic government. Saying that the ANC had become a political party
which no longer qualified for government assistance, the cut-off date was
set at three months before South Africa's first multiracial election
scheduled for April 27.
Officials said aid to the ANC was SKr110m (Pounds 9.1m) in the 1992-93
Swedish budget year, out of total Swedish development aid to South Africa of
SKr240m. It is being maintained at last year's level in the current budget
year, despite the cut to the ANC, but will fall to SKr220m in 1994-95.
