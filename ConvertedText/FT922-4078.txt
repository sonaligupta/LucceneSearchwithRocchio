FT  08 JUN 92 / Arts: Today's Television


   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY


Having gone from managing director to the dole queue, Philip Walker started
the Campaign Against Age Discrimination in Employment, subject of Open Space
(7.40 BBC2).
Horizon (8.10 BBC2) and World In Action (8.30 ITV) are both concerned with
international sport. The former promises to tell the story of 'State Plan
14.25', East Germany's programme for the routine drugging of the former
country's sporting elite. The latter shows the second half of its report on
the Olympics including the way in which cities compete for the right to
stage the games, and again the widespread use of drugs. The Guilty is a
four-hour thriller to be shown wrapped around News At 10 today and tomorrow.
Michael Kitchen, we are told, plays a 'ruthless barrister' about to be
appointed a judge 'but his fatal flaws are alcohol and women'. That word
'fatal' might ruin the plot. BBC1 repeats Tumbledown Charles Wood's
outstanding drama - vivid and technically superb, pro-soldier but anti-war -
about the Falklands war and in particular Scots Guards Lieutenant Robert
Lawrence who had the top of his head blown off by a sniper (10.10).
