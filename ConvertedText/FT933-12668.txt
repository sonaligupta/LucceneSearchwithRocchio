FT  23 JUL 93 / Beijing acts to rein in speculators


   By REUTER


   BEIJING


CHINA yesterday ordered its military to stop using public funds to gamble in
property and foreign exchange trading, Reuter reports from Beijing.
An order from the Central Military Commission, published in all the main
newspapers, demanded that illegal uses of funds should be investigated and
the culprits punished.
The attempt to rein in speculative fever in the military came as Vice
Premier Zou Jiahua promised stern measures to crack down on real estate
speculation throughout the country that has caused heavy losses to the
state.
The Ministry of Justice joined the campaign to restore economic order,
forbidding lawyers from giving professional advice to 'illegal fundraising'
activities, including unapproved stock and bond issues. China is trying to
reassert control over an economy that is overheating  - growth is at nearly
14 per cent a year and inflation in large cities is more than 20 per cent.
'Military funds must not be put into personal savings accounts,' the Central
Military Commission order said. 'It is strictly forbidden to speculate in
foreign exchange.'
The military commission, which commands the 3m-strong People's Liberation
Army, ordered an end to expensive projects that have nothing to do with
defence. Real estate speculation has turned much of China's countryside into
a building site and sent the costs of raw materials soaring.
