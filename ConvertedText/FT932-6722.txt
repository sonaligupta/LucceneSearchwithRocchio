FT  27 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Terrorist detention laws upheld -
European Court of Human Rights rules for the government


GOVERNMENT powers to arrest and detain terrorist suspects do not violate
human rights, the European Court of Human Rights ruled yesterday.
The court said the situation in Northern Ireland justified an exemption for
Britain from a requirement under the European Human Rights Convention that
suspects be brought 'promptly' to court.
Judges voted 22-4 to reject a complaint by two Northern Irishmen who claimed
their human rights were breached when they were arrested and held under the
Prevention of Terrorism Act - one for six days, 14 hours and 30 minutes and
one for four days, six hours and 25 minutes.
The Prevention of Terrorism Act allows the home secretary to detain
terrorist suspects for up to five days without charge.
After being found guilty by the Human Rights Court in 1988 following a
similar case, the government invoked an exemption under a convention
provision which states that in time of war or 'other public emergency
threatening the life of the nation' a government can be exempted from its
obligations 'to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the
situation'. The judges effectively stated that the 'public emergency' in
Northern Ireland was sufficient grounds for the government to take
exceptional measures.
The judges said that in the light of the 'extent and impact' of terrorist
violence in Northern Ireland and elsewhere in the UK there was a 'public
emergency'. After being found guilty of breaching human rights in 1988, the
government either had to introduce new judicial measures or claim an
exemption from its human rights obligations. There was no indication the
exemption was 'other than a genuine response' to the terrorist situation.
