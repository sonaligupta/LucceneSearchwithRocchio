FT  06 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Flagstone incurs reduced deficit of Pounds
730,000


   By MAGGIE URRY


FLAGSTONE Holdings, the marina, leisure and property group, incurred a
reduced loss of Pounds 730,000 before tax, down from Pounds 2.5m, in the
year to January 31, after a return to profits at the operating level.
The group warned that uncertainty over its future working capital, resulting
from an acquisition currently under discussion, was expected to be referred
to by its auditors in their report on the accounts.
On Monday, Flagstone said it was in talks with another party over a deal
which 'will have a significant impact on the company's prospects.'
The other party has lent Flagstone Pounds 500,000 for one year at a 7 per
cent interest rate to provide working capital.
Flagstone said yesterday that Charterhouse Tilney no longer acted as its
broker, Williams de Broe was advising on the transaction.
Group sales were Pounds 612,000 (Pounds 1.11m) and operating profits Pounds
466,000 (Pounds 310,000 loss).
Net interest payable was Pounds 208,000 (Pounds 407,000) and there was a
Pounds 573,000 write-down of the company's marina (Pounds 625,000 property
write down).
Losses per share were 0.53p (1.58p loss).
