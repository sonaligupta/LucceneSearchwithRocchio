FT  20 APR 94 / UK Company News: BTR chief's salary revealed for first time
 -Executive Pay


   By ANDREW BOLGER


The salary of Mr Alan Jackson, chief executive of BTR, has for the first
time appeared in the industrial conglomerate's annual report.
It shows Mr Jackson earned between Pounds 510,001 and Pounds 515,000 in the
year ended December, compared with between Pounds 460,001 and Pounds 465,000
in 1992.
Previously Mr Jackson's salary had not been shown in the accounts because
his duties were considered by BTR to be discharged mainly outside the UK.
The 1985 Companies Act requires only the salary of the chairman and UK
executives be published. The act also states this information 'need not be
given in respect of a director who discharged his duties as such wholly or
mainly outside the UK'.
BTR last year published the salaries of its three non-UK directors after
analysts and institutional investors expressed surprise that Mr Jackson was
deemed to come into this category. Last year about 75 per cent of BTR's
turnover came from outside the UK.
The annual report says BTR is still not complying with the Cadbury
recommendation that companies should have an audit committee confined to
non-executive directors who should have a discussion with the auditors at
least once a year, without executive board members present, to ensure that
there are no unresolved issues of concern.
BTR's audit committee comprises all directors, including executives. The
report says: 'BTR believes all directors should be aware of and accept
responsibility for matters dealt with by this committee. The auditors may
raise any relevant issue with any of the directors, just as all directors
have access to the auditors.'
