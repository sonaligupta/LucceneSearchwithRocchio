FT  21 JUL 94 / Malaysia to lift trade ban


   By ROBERT PESTON


The Malaysian government is poised to announce a lifting of the ban on UK
participation in government contracts, Robert Peston writes. The ban was
imposed in February partly because of Malaysian government fury with British
press coverage of the Pergau dam affair.
'We believe the embargo could be lifted tomorrow,' said a banker close to
the Malaysian government. UK businessmen with Malaysian interests are
convinced the embargo will be removed by the end of July. The Malaysian
government yesterday refused to comment.
