FT  23 NOV 92 / Observer: No joke


Even ministerial speechwriters are not immune to spending cuts and job
losses it seems. How else can one explain the repetitive nature of Michael
Heseltine's speech-making in the current round of annual dinners?
Last Wednesday, he skilfully negotiated the annual dinner of the Machine
Tool Technologies Association - a minefield if ever there was one, given
current events. A day later he was on safer ground at the Institution of
Mechanical Engineers' bash. Somebody, perhaps, should have told the great
communicator that machine tool men and mechanical engineers are not as
different as they sound.
Most of the jokes and stories were the same. In the good old days, Hezza
told both audiences, it used to be easy to write a speech because you could
simply ring up the Conservative Central Office joke department. Now, sadly,
the department has been closed because there's nothing to laugh about any
more.
