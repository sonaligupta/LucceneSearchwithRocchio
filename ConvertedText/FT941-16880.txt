FT  07 JAN 94 / Arts: Today's Television


   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY


Inspiration for the last of BBC2's sequence of ballets created specially for
television, Dance For The Camera, was 'The Rime Of The Ancient Mariner'.
Choreography is by William Tuckett, the performers include Anthony Dowell
and Michael Nunn, and the verses are spoken by John Gielgud (8.15).
There are two new gardening series which, surprisingly, do not clash. In The
Great British Garden Show Ruth Langsford meets some of those who grow
flowers, fruit and vegetables for summer shows (8.30 BBC2). The moment that
ends C4 begins Nature Perfected (9.00) which is about the history of
gardening.
Fans of Red Dwarf, the comedy set in deep space, may want to set their VCRs
at 9.00 for Episode 1. This is the beginning of a repeat run of all six
series. At the same time ITV shows the opening episode in another batch of
The Chief, a police series about a chief constable which began strongly but
has deteriorated somewhat. In Further Abroad (9.30 BBC2) Jonathan Meades
continues his exploration of architectural odds and ends.
