FT  29 APR 94 / Car groups in recycling pact


   By JOHN GRIFFITHS


Carmakers yesterday took a big step forward in dealing with the
environmental problem of the 9m-10m cars scrapped annually in Europe.
Renault, Fiat and BMW signed an agreement in Brussels under which each
company will recycle the others' cars as well as its own. The three groups
have a combined European market share of more than 28 per cent, and the
agreement is likely to cover more than 1m of the cars scrapped annually. It
is expected to include the UK's Rover Group, now owned by BMW.
The agreement is part of a planned European recycling network for the
collection and recycling of scrapped cars agreed between the European
Commission and the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA).
Similar agreements are expected to be signed eventually by all Europe's
carmakers.
