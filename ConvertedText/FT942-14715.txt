FT  19 APR 94 / UK Company News: Hickson chief's payments jump to Pounds
183,000


   By DAVID WIGHTON


Mr Dennis Kerrison, chief executive of Hickson International, saw his total
emoluments jump by 45 per cent from Pounds 126,000 to Pounds 183,000 last
year when the chemicals company's profits fell by 9 per cent to Pounds
22.1m.
The increase partly reflects his promotion in 1992 when he was a director of
the group for only nine months. On an annualised basis his salary rose by 15
per cent to Pounds 137,000.
He also received a performance-related bonus of Pounds 34,000 (Pounds 8,000)
linked to targets for profits, cashflow and 'personal objectives'. The
company said Mr Kerrison received no bonus triggered by profits and only a
minimal payment for cashflow. The bulk of the payment related to 'the way he
has developed and driven forward the business'.
