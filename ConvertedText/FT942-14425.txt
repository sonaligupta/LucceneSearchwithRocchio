FT  20 APR 94 / International Company News: American Barrick ahead 31%


   By BERNARD SIMON

Rising production and lower costs helped American Barrick, the Toronto-based
gold producer, to a 31 per cent rise in first-quarter earnings.
Net earnings rose to USDollars 60.4m, or 21 cents a share, from Dollars
46.1m, or 16 cents, a year ago. Revenues climbed to Dollars 187.3m from
Dollars 144.1m.
Gold output jumped to 451,981 ounces from 354,839 ounces, reflecting rising
production from the Betze-Post deposit at Barrick's flagship Goldstrike mine
in Nevada. Unexpectedly high throughput at Goldstrike also contributed to a
drop in operating costs to Dollars 160 an ounce from Dollars 174 an ounce.
Due to an active hedging programme, the average price of gold received was
well above prevailing market prices at Dollars 403 per ounce, but lower than
the Dollars 410 average a year earlier.
Barrick has markedly expanded its offshore activities in the past year. It
reported that drilling on the Corona property in northern Peru points to
'good mineralisation' at a depth of 400 metres. Eleven drills and close to
100 people are working on the site.
Total production this year is forecast at about 1.8 ounces, rising to 2m
ounces in 1995. Another mine on the Goldstrike property is due to reach full
production of 400,000 ounces a year in late 1996.
