FT  30 JUN 93 / Poland unveils plan for oil industry privatisation

POLAND plans to keep its oil refining and petroleum products distribution in
the hands of private domestic investors, while seeking to attract foreign
investment in individual refineries and petrol station networks.
According to Dr Andrzej Olechowski, a former finance minister retained by
the government to prepare a plan for the privatisation of the sector, the
industry would be reorganised into a holding company, the Polish Oil Company
(POC). This would then be privatised through the sale of shares at a
discount to local banks, financial institutions and small investors.
A 30 per cent share would stay in state hands or foreign financial
institutions like the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, in
which Poland has a share.
The plan, which has yet to be accepted by the Council of Ministers, foresees
the sale of a 50 per cent share in Poland's two major refineries at Plock
and Gdansk to foreign investors. The purchasers would also have the right to
buy some state-owned petrol stations. The remaining 50 per cent share in the
refineries would stay in the hands of the POC.
The sale of the sector, according to Dr Olechowski, is designed to raise
Dollars 2.5bn for modernising the industry to improve competitiveness once
15 per cent tariffs on petrol imports start to be phased out in 1998.
Amoco is to explore for coalbed methane in the Upper Silesian coalfield in
southern Poland.
The contract for three-year drilling is estimated to be worth Dollars 10m,
and will be implemented once the Polish government has agreed to ease tax
provisions and provide safeguards against foreign exchange risks arising
from the steady devaluation of the zloty.
