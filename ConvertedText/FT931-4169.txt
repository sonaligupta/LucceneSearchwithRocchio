FT  12 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Japanese say US chip deals cancelled


   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO

JAPANESE semiconductor users have complained that US manufacturers have been
cancelling supply contracts because of a shortage of semiconductors in the
US.
Mr Yuji Tanahashi, vice-minister at the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry, said that Japanese semiconductor users had protested to an
industry body. If the complaint turned out to be true, Japan would ask the
US to take action at the bilateral meeting in Hawaii next week to review
results of their agreement on opening the Japanese market to foreign
suppliers.
The US claims that the semiconductor agreement between the two countries
calls for a foreign market share of 20 per cent, while the Japanese insist
that the 20 per cent figure was just a US industry expectation and not a
Japanese guarantee.
The slowdown in the Japanese economy means that the 20 per cent target is
unlikely to be met. Japan has been working hard to meet US criticism by
publicising its efforts to buy foreign semiconductors and clarifying why it
thinks foreign market share has not risen as much as the US would like.
In an attempt to indicate the Japanese commitment to increasing foreign
market share, Miti, for example, recently asked Japanese semiconductor users
to make further efforts to buy from abroad even though the deadline for the
20 per cent target was the end of last year.
