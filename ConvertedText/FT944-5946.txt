FT  01 DEC 94 / People: Humer heads back to Switzerland


   By DANIEL GREEN


Franz Humer, one of the top board directors at Glaxo, Europe's biggest drugs
company, has resigned suddenly to 'take up a senior appointment in the
international pharmaceutical industry next year'.
Glaxo says Humer, a Swiss citizen, plans to return home to Switzerland.
Meanwhile, Roche, a Swiss drugs company, would not comment on suggestions
that Humer might take the job of head of its Pharma Operations subsidiary.
That post became vacant on November 14 when Peter Simon departed to pursue
private interests.
Humer made his intention clear to Glaxo a week ago. Although on a rolling
three-year contract - which prevents him from taking a job with a rival
company for six months - he leaves on December 1 without any severance
payment. Humer had been a main board director of Glaxo since 1989 and in
March 1993 became the director responsible for research and development,
commercial strategy, manufacturing and Latin America.
He joined Glaxo in 1981 as area controller for southern Europe and moved
through several posts to become managing director of Glaxo Pharmaceuticals
in the UK in 1987.
With a strong reputation in marketing and selling, Humer had been in the
frame to land the top job at Glaxo after Ernest Mario's departure as chief
executive in March 1993. But the position went to Sir Richard Sykes, the
research and development director.
Glaxo said yesterday that it would be examining several options for
replacing Humer or changing the structure reporting to that role. But the
company said strategy and development would 'not be affected in any way' by
his departure.
Glaxo's shares fell yesterday by 8p to 617p.
