FT  22 JUL 94 / British & Commonwealth Collapse: The DTI Report - Partner
'deceived' Atlantic auditors / Co-Founder


   By SIMON DAVIES


John Gunn built British & Commonwealth Holdings into a company worth Pounds
2.5bn in a few furiously busy years in the 1980s. But his purchase of
Atlantic Computers, a deeply flawed company, proved his undoing. B&C crashed
in 1990 with Pounds 1bn in liabilities. Suits and counter-suits against
advisers are seeking some Pounds 3.5bn in compensation
Mr Vernon Davies was a co-architect of the leasing scheme which dragged down
Atlantic Computers but he lived very much in the shadow of his more forceful
partner Mr John Foulston.
The inspectors found that Mr Davies 'deliberately deceived' Spicer &
Oppenheim and Rothschilds, Atlantic's auditors and financial adviser, over
the extent of the company's liabilities. If the truth had been known, the
flotation could not have proceeded, the inspectors concluded.
Mr Davies avoided being listed for disqualification as a director but
nevertheless yesterday hit out at the inspectors' report: 'I believe the
inspectors have been less than fair with me and I think they were totally
unjustified in the conclusions they reached.'
He was well rewarded for his time with Atlantic. He made Pounds 1m from
share sales to Messrs Jagger and Skinner who took a 60 per cent stake in the
company, Pounds 3.9m from the flotation, and Pounds 13m when he finally sold
out of the business in 1986.
Mr Davies stood as a Conservative candidate in the Sheffield Central
constituency in the April, 1992, General Election. He polled just 5,470
votes and lost to Labour candidate Mr Richard Caborn who polled 22,764
votes.
He is thought to be seeking a safe seat to fight at the next general
election.
