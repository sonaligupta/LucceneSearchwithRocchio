FT  30 JUN 93 / International Company News: State covers default at Swedbank


   By HUGH CARNEGY

THE SWEDISH government was forced yesterday to lay out SKr400m (Dollars
51.8m) to cover an interest payment missed by the owners of Swedbank, the
largest bank in the Nordic region by asset volume.
The move takes the state a step closer to becoming a principal shareholder
in another of Sweden's ailing bank groups.
The state Bank Support Authority stepped in to make the first interest
payment due on a SKr3.5bn commercial loan raised by Swedbank's main
shareholders as part of a government-backed package to ensure the capital
adequacy of the loss-hit bank.
The government guaranteed the commercial loan and provided a further state
loan of SKr3.8bn to the 11 savings bank foundations, whose institutions were
merged late last year to form Swedbank. In return, the foundations, which
own 55 per cent of the voting capital in Swedbank, pledged 70 per cent of
their shareholding as collateral.
However, a lack of dividend flow from Swedbank meant the foundations were
unable to pay the first interest tranche on the commercial loan, forcing the
government to redeem its guarantee and call in the equity collateral.
The Bank Support Authority was yesterday at pains to stress this did not
mean the state had, in effect, become a 40 per cent shareholder in Swedbank.
It is clearly a possibility, however, if the foundations go into deeper
default.
The state has already completely taken over two Swedish banks - Gotabanken
and Nordbanken - and pledged SKr74bn in aid for the banking sector, stricken
last year by a spate of loan losses. It is still negotiating on a further
package of aid for Swedbank.
