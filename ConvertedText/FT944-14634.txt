FT  21 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow tumbles as data upset
bond market

Wall Street
US stocks retreated yesterday as unfavourable economic news sent bond yields
surging, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 24.89 lower at 3,911.15, while the
more broadly based Standard & Poor's 500 was down 3.43 at 466.85. Declining
issues outnumbered advances by 1,489 to 688 on the New York SE after heavy
volume of 331m shares.
The Nasdaq composite slipped 2.38 to 768.24 and the American SE composite
shed 0.50 to 457.76.
The catalyst for the downturn was a revival of pessimism in the bond market.
The recent confidence established there was severely shaken by two sets of
data suggesting that the economy was growing at an unmanageable pace and
inflationary pressures were mounting.
The Commerce Department announced a 4.4 per cent jump in housing starts last
month, to an adjusted annualised rate of 1.5m units, the highest since last
December. Even more disturbing was news from the Philadelphia Federal
Reserve that its index of business act-ivity had surged, while prices paid
and received were up sharply.
The data pushed up yields on the inflation-sensitive long bond to just below
8.00 per cent, a level at which stocks could lose much of their relative
attraction.
The resurgence of interest rate fears, suppressed over the past fortnight,
overshadowed the steady stream of mostly positive earnings news flowing into
Wall Street.
IBM, still the bellwether of the technology group, slipped Dollars  3/8 to
Dollars 75, even though its third-quarter net income of Dollars 1.13 a share
easily beat the consensus forecast of analysts.
But General Motors failed to measure up to expectations and its stock was
punished as a consequence. The value of its share price fell 8.3 per cent,
or Dollars 3 7/8 , to Dollars 43 after the company revealed details of a
disappointing operating performance. Chrysler, which had turned in a solid
performance last week, was marked down Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 46 1/2 .
Sears Roebuck, the big retailing chain, posted net income that was nearly 20
per cent better than analysts were predicting, but the stock made scant
progress, gaining Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 48 1/2 . The negative sentiment
was evident in stocks across the board, whether or not they had earnings
news to report.
Among the Dow industrial components, General Electric lost Dollars 1 1/4 at
Dollars 49 and Procter & Gamble fell Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 62 5/8 . Only
Alcoa, the aluminium producer, bucked the trend, adding Dollars 1 7/8 at
Dollars 90 1/4 .
On the Nasdaq, many technology stocks were lower, including Borland, which
plunged Dollars 2 1/4 at Dollars 9 3/4 after disappointing investors with an
operating loss.
However, there was a positive response to Microsoft's earnings statement.
The stock improved Dollars 2 to Dollars 59 3/8 on heavy trading of 8.5m
shares.
Canada
The Toronto market ended flat after moderate trading, having rebounded from
earlier lows with support from heavily weighted gold shares, which had
warred with interest rate jitters for dominance.
The TSE 300 index lost just 1.02 points on balance at 4,319.77, while falls
retained a narrow edge over rises by 438 to 324 after volume of 64.5m shares
valued at CDollars 743m.
Nine of the 14 sub-indices were down, led by transportation, financial
services, consumer products, and paper and forest stocks. Golds, real
estate, base metals and utilities posted gains. The New York spot price for
gold increased by USDollars 1.10 to USDollars 391.50 an ounce.
Brazil
Shares in Sao Paulo reacted cautiously to the announcement on Wednesday of a
package of financial measures aimed at reducing inflation and restricting
the inflow of foreign investment into the country.
The Bovespa index ended 343 or 0.7 per cent down at 47,244. Volume was a low
RDollars 260m.
A stock analyst said trading was both weak and volatile yesterday after a
reasonably firm opening. Initial market reaction to Wednesday's news was
relief that a tax on stock investments was introduced at no more than 1 per
cent, but trading then fell back in a climate of uncertainty, the analyst
added.
The market was expected to move in a narrow range over the next few days as
investors digested the package of measures.
