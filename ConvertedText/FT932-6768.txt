FT  27 MAY 93 / New announcement from Treasury


THE TREASURY yesterday announced two measures to make it easier to attract
private investment for public infrastructure and services.
It has published guidance notes making it easier for public-sector bodies to
lease goods and services from the private sector other than for property and
roads. Leases covered by the guidance will be subject to a value-for-money
test.
There will also be proposals to help offset the cost to private investors of
developing schemes which then go to open competition.
