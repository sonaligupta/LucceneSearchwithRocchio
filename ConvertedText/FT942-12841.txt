FT  27 APR 94 / Li under fire over nuclear tests


   By REUTER


   ALMA ATA


Premier Li Peng of China experienced the first open protest of his tour of
Central Asia yesterday, when activists in Kazakhstan attacked China's
nuclear tests near the region's border, Reuter reports from Alma Ata.
Earlier, Mr Li had signed an historic accord delineating the 1,700km border
between China and Kazakhstan. He also granted the former Soviet republic a
Yn50m (Dollars 5.75m) credit.
In another development, a Chinese spokesman said that Kazakh President
Nursultan Nazarbayev had agreed to curb the activities of groups in
Kazakhstan working for the independence for China's north-western Xinjiang
region.
About 150 anti-nuclear activists voted to send an open letter to Mr Li
saying nuclear tests since 1963 in Xinjiang had 'tortured' the earth and
were affecting people in Kazakhstan. Xinjiang's Lop Nur, where the last
nuclear blast was in 1993, is a few hundred kilometres from the Kazakh
border.
