FT  12 NOV 92 / Observer: Re-touched


South African rugby fans confidently expect to recover the price of their
tickets for Saturday's game - up to Pounds 500 on the black market, I'm told
 -by backing the Springboks at what they consider to be attractive odds.
Ladbrokes has opened its books on what some see as a re-run of the Boer War,
offering 3-1 against a South African victory; 2-9 on an English win, and
14-1 on a draw.
