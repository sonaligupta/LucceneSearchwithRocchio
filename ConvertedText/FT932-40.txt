FT  30 JUN 93 / Survey of Italy (9): Pride of a nation damaged by tagenti -
Corruption has been unearthed on a truly vast scale


   By ROBERT GRAHAM


THE WORD tagentopoli has become deeply embedded in the national
consciousness in a remarkably short time.
Tagenti are bribes, and when the corruption scandals first began to break in
Milan 16 months ago the city was dubbed tagentopolis. But as the scandals
spread throughout Italy, the polis turned plural to tagentopoli. The
expression is now short-hand both for the investigations into corruption as
well as the system of corruption itself.
Corruption has been unearthed on a truly vast scale. Without exaggeration
virtually every institution of state is either implicated or risks being
implicated. Few public figures are untainted. In Milan alone 800 persons
have been caught up in the investigations and 111 have already passed
through the courts. More than 105 members of parliament are directly
affected and risk incrimination.
The pride of Italian industry has been dragged in, damaging the image of
private groups such as Fiat and Olivetti or state companies such as IRI, the
main holding company, Eni, the oil concern, and Enel, the electricity
authority. Bribes are revealed to have been paid on anything from minor
pharmaceutical supply contracts to theatres, railway carriages, power
stations, football stadiums and waste treatment plants.
The total amount of money involved has been estimated at L5,000bn a year.
But this is merely a guestimate by analysts examining the size of public
sector contracts awarded annually and then factoring in revelations on the
percentages demanded by the politicians and their henchmen. Contracts in the
telecommunications sector involved 2 per cent of the total value. Power
station contracts carried percentages of up to 3 per cent.
But it is now clear the combination of contractors paying bribes and the
authorities accepting rigged bids added considerably to public expenditure.
From the late Eighties the majority of projects were costing between 15 and
20 per cent more than was necessary. Indeed, this month in Milan a municipal
construction tender was bid 50 per cent below the rate prevailing before the
corruption scandals broke in February 1992.
Overall, according to the calculations of one research institute, the
elaborate system of bribes was latterly costing the country L15,000bn a year
in extra expenditure and the extra cost of borrowing to cover the spending.
Such figures may overstate the cost, but they nevertheless convey a sense of
the scale of corruption and the extent to which it came to burden the
economy. It is also abundantly clear that during the Eighties corruption
became systematic. The main political parties placed their trusted
'collectors' or executives throughout the state apparatus to ensure that
funds were diverted to their coffers - and towards their own pockets. The
degree of personal enrichment has been substantial.
Those who have confessed to taking bribes freely concede that as much as 60
per cent of all monies collected ended up in the bank accounts of
individuals. Perhaps it is no accident that all the main parties have
serious deficits. The worst deficit is that of the Socialists, regarded as
the most avaricious, with a staggering L214bn plus a further L30bn
outstanding in local sections. If the money had been channelled solely to
the party, the deficit could never have been so high.
The funds illicitly obtained in the name of the main political parties have
come in several different forms. Normally businessmen have handed over money
to the politicians and their bagmen in return for winning contracts in the
public sector. These contracts have been awarded by state agencies such as
Anas, the roads authority, utilities such as Enel or by municipal
authorities in such spheres as transport, health and waste treatment.
Alternatively, state companies have been deliberately 'milked'. Their
political masters obliged these companies to make contributions. Usually
this was through foreign operations. The most significant case has been the
illicit funding by Eni, the state oil concern and its subsidiaries. Last
month Saipem, Eni's pipeline subsidiary, revealed that since 1987 it had
paid out L225bn in bribes and commissions to Italian and foreign
intermediaries, most of this via a friendly Swiss banking institution.
Contributions have also been made in the form of indirect transfers such as
support for politicians' pet projects, political meetings and advertising
campaigns.
There are also instances of deliberate agreements between the politicians,
local authorities, the public administration and companies to defraud the
exchequer. This has especially been the case in southern Italy. Here the
most flagrant example has been the misuse of the huge sums of money
available for reconstruction after the I980 Irpinia earthquake near Naples.
Other instances include the construction programme for the 1990 World Cup
football competition and deals to inflate expenditure or carry out
unnecessary projects.
The practice of concert party deals between politicians, businessmen and
officials agreeing to defraud the state has arguably been the most damaging
aspect of the corruption scandals on the public accounts. But equally, there
have been cases of one public company agreeing to pay a bribe to another to
obtain a contract, while the illicit monies are shared among the
politicians.
The share-out has usually been on the basis of the party's proportion of the
national vote or their respective weight inside the government. Minor
coalition partners such as the Liberals and Social Democrats obtained
illicit finance wholly disproportionate to their share of the vote simply
because they were in government. But the lion's share has gone to the
Christian Democrats and the Socialists, the dominant coalition parties. The
opposition, too, in the form of the old Communist Party and its successor
the Party of the Democratic Left(PDS), was frequently co-opted, normally by
a deal to offer a proportion of contracts to their co-operatives.
The inquiries have acquired a momentum of their own as the magistrates
establish inter-locking threads and the exploit of the system of plea
bargaining. Basically people are arrested and imprisoned until they accept
to talk. The information thus gathered has been selectively released by the
magistrates breaking most norms of justice intended to protect an
individual's innocence.
Nevertheless, this practice has achieved its aim of discrediting the
political establishment which proceeded to occupy and rape the state for its
own selfish needs in the post-war era. It has also unmasked the mechanics of
corruption which cannot easily be reproduced on the same scale in the short
or even medium term. Arguably such objectives lay behind the Milan
magistrates' drive to uproot corruption in the city.
The investigative phase of tagentopoli will soon play second fiddle to other
issues as the process moves towards the courts. For instance, is the
judicial system equipped to cope with trying so many people? Is it realistic
to consider an amnesty as the practices unmasked relate essentially to a
vanishing political system?
A case can take up to 10 years to complete its slow path through the full
array of courts. Equally, such is the morass of contradictory legislation
that the prosecution fails in 75 per cent of all cases. Simplified
procedures may well be introduced to despatch the cases of those who have
pleaded guilty and have agreed to co-operate with justice. But with the
politicians who are contesting charges, especially the serious one of
extortion (ie forcing businessmen to pay bribes against the threat of not
obtaining contracts), quick trials are not proving so easy to contemplate.
