FT  19 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Germany


Not only have German engineering workers struck a pay deal of less than 6
per cent without a strike. They are also committed to an increase of only
3.4 per cent next year. That should go a long way towards breaking the
wage-price spiral. Add in expectations of a downward lurch in inflation
during the summer as last year's energy tax increases fall out of the
equation, and it becomes easy to see why financial markets are speculating
about easier Bundesbank policy.
The snag remains the rate at which M3 money is expanding. Though there are
technical reasons why increasing interest rates would make the problem
worse, the Bundesbank would surely suffer a serious loss of credibility if
it eased while money growth was nearly twice the target ceiling. Besides, if
its worry about the wage round has diminished, it still has to keep up
pressure on the government to curb the budget deficit. Money may soon start
to move out of cash in anticipation of an eventual rate cut, but equities
are unlikely to maintain the pace set by yesterday's 2 per cent rise of the
DAX index.
