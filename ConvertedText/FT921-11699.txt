FT  30 JAN 92 / Working groups to discuss Mideast regional issues


   By HUGH CARNEGY and REUTER


   JERUSALEM


MIDDLE East disarmament, economic development, water resources and
environment are to be discussed by working groups this spring in Europe, the
Middle East, Japan and the US.
The agreement on more detailed talks about regional issues involving Israel,
its neighbours and the international community was reached yesterday during
the second and final day of Middle East talks in Moscow.
The Palestinians, who did not take part in the talks, have asked that the
issue of Jerusalem and human rights also be addressed in multilateral
working committees.
Meanwhile, India said it was establishing full diplomatic relations with
Israel for the first time, completing the Jewish state's links with Asia's
two most populous nations, after China's similar decision last Friday,
writes Hugh Carnegy.
Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the prime minister, noted this week that a long period of
diplomatic isolation for Israel was ending.
In the past few months, most Arab countries have engaged Israel in peace
talks and the former Soviet Union, as well as China and India - all key
backers of the Palestine Liberation Organisation - have established full
ties despite Mr Shamir's unyielding policies towards the Palestinians.
Mr Shamir agreed in principle with the opposition Labour party to hold a
general election on June 23, Reuter reports from Jerusalem. Ms Sarah Doron,
head of the Likud parliamentary faction, said: 'It was agreed for 23 June'.
However, a Labour party spokesman said agreement on the date would have to
win approval from Labour leaders today.
