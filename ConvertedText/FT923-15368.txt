FT  02 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Hurd to visit Hong Kong


   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent


MR DOUGLAS HURD, the foreign secretary, announced in the Commons yesterday
that he will visit Hong Kong from July 26 to July 28.
Replying to demands for action to extend democracy in Hong Kong before it
reverts to Chinese control in 1997, he made clear that decisions about the
election to be held in 1995 were some way off.
Mr Hurd said Mr Chris Patten, setting out later this week to take up his
post as the last British governor of the colony, would be undertaking
wide-ranging consultations.
When Mr Patten had weighed up the different views he would advise the
government. Mr Hurd emphasised that he would not be announcing any decisions
about the 1995 election during his visit.
Responding to a charge by Mr Tony Banks, Labour MP for Newham North West,
that the UK government was distancing itself from the democratic movement in
Hong Kong, the foreign secretary said the government hoped to ensure
arrangements made for 1995 continued after 1997.
Mr Alastair Goodlad, foreign office junior minister, stated that the total
number of people in Hong Kong eligible to vote in the legislative council
elections in September 1991 was 3.7m of whom 1.9m registered.
