FT  22 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: SG Warburg


After its abortive approach to the market last month, SG Warburg had to
ensure that any fresh attempt to raise capital was a conspicuous success.
Hence yesterday's Pounds 91m convertible bond issue was attractively priced
and targetted more to continental investors than the City institutions who
snubbed it in the first place. The fact that Warburg has persevered
underlines a need for additional comfort where capital is concerned.
Warburg does not publish its BIS ratios and says with astonishing candour
that the measure it does publish - shareholders' funds as a percentage of
year-end assets - is not very meaningful. But the ratio did fall to 4.6 per
cent from 5.9 per cent last year.
The new capital will also give Warburg flexibility in trading on its own
account. Notwithstanding the lavish fees it can expect to earn from BT3 and
corporate clients from Zeneca to Richemont, Warburg must focus more on
trading to improve on its woefully inadequate rates of return. The danger,
highlighted by yesterday's Group of 30 report on derivatives, is that such a
strategy also involves increased risk. One has to hope Warburg has learned
the lessons from last year's losses in the bond market.
