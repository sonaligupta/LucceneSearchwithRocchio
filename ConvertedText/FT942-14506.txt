FT  20 APR 94 / Arts: Today's Television


   By GAY FIRTH


I bet you have already forgotten 1988: the launch of Red Nose Day; Ronald
Reagan's first visit to the (then) Soviet Union; Ben Johnson's Olympic 100m
race which ended in disgrace. The Rock 'n' Roll Years - the 80s (7.00 BBC1)
may remind you - and if you switch over afterwards you can play
spot-the-difference between its curious characters and the ones in Who
Framed Roger Rabbit (8.00 ITV), a comedy film starring Bob Hoskins which
mixes humans and animated action. No prizes for guessing when the movie was
made (1988).
Otherwise a pretty skimpy evening, including a Lib-Dem Party Election
Broadcast (9.00 BBC1, 9.55 ITV, 10.30 BBC2 - heaven help us) and a couple of
so-so sitcoms, Last of the Summer Wine (8.00 BBC1) and Luv (8.30 BBC1).
For real humour, Screen Two: Henri (9.30 BBC2) is a charming comedy set,
believe it or not, in Northern Ireland. Henri is a 10-year-old country girl
who comes to the big city to play her accordion at a music festival, but if
accordion -playing sets your teeth on edge you can find Maggie Cole playing
Purcell, Couperin and Bach at 9.40 on Radio 3.
