FT  13 APR 94 / International Company News: Wood products unit helps
Weyerhaeuser results

Weyerhaeuser, the US forest products company, yesterday reported
first-quarter earnings of Dollars 127m, or 62 cents a share, slightly down
from earnings before special charges of Dollars 133m, or 65 cents, in the
first quarter of 1993.
But operating earnings rose to Dollars 295m, or Dollars 1.44 a share, from
Dollars 276m, or Dollars 1.36, in the same quarter last year.
Sales were flat during the period at Dollars 2.4bn, compared with Dollars
2.3bn.
Operating results were slightly better than Wall Street expected, and
prompted some analysts to lift full-year earnings projections for the
company above Dollars 3 per share.
Most of the operating improvement came from the timberlands and wood
products division, which earned Dollars 283m in the quarter, against Dollars
226m a year ago. Weyerhaeuser benefited from rising prices for wood products
in the wake of environmental restrictions that have limited logging on
public lands in the US.
Mr Mark Rogers, analyst with Prudential Securities, said 'Weyerhaeuser is
unique because it has so much of its own timber.'
The sharp rise in timber and wood products earnings masked continuing
weakness in the pulp and paper segment. The division's earnings fell to
Dollars 5m in the first quarter, from Dollars 35m a year ago.
However, Weyerhaeuser said recent price improvements in market pulp and
containerboard packaging helped the division reverse a loss from the 1993
fourth quarter.
Property and financial services operations earned Dollars 7m in the first
quarter, down from Dollars 15m in the 1993 period.
Mr John Creighton, president, said: 'Our ability to achieve these results,
in spite of significant weather interruptions and the Los Angeles
earthquake, reflects improving operating efficiencies we have realised with
the implementation of our business improvement plans.'
