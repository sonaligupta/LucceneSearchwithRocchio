FT  05 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Bank success


   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and ZHANG TINGTING


Good results from the Midland Bank arm of HSBC provided further evidence
that there was money to be made out of the turmoil within the European
exchange rate mechanism and sent HSBC shares higher on a generally listless
day. HSBC ordinary rose 19 to 690p, a record high, on turnover of 5m.
Analysts were taken aback by a half-year figure of Pounds 385m, against
Pounds 60m in the same period last year. The gain reflected a surge in
earnings from Midland's treasury and dealing arm Midland Global Markets, one
of London's leading foreign exchange players. There was also a big rise in
debt securities, suggesting that the bank had hedged itself succesfully
against falling interest rates.
Analysts raised end of year forecasts for HSBC to between Pounds 2.4bn and
Pounds 2.9bn for the year-end. Mr John Aitken, banking analyst with UBS,
said that, while fundamental doubts over the bank remained, the bank's
dealing side had done very well. Although he remained a seller he lifted his
estimate by Pounds 400m to Pounds 2.6bn.
