FT  13 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Japan agrees limited increase to cartel
fine


   By ROBERT THOMSON


JAPAN's ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the Fair Trade Commission (FTC)
have agreed that the maximum fine for violators of anti-monopoly laws should
be raised from Y5m (Pounds 22,000) to Y100m, far below the Y300m earlier
proposed by the FTC, writes Robert Thomson.
Senior politicians told the commission that they would not approve the
introduction of legislation containing penalties of above Y100m, as Japanese
companies had complained to the ruling party that the FTC's proposal was
excessive.
The US had demanded that Japan revise the schedule of fines for violators
and increase the staff at the commission - which has been condemned by
corporate Japan for being too vigorous in its pursuit of offenders.
In reaching the Y100m figure, Japanese officials attempted to balance their
responsibilities to politically influential companies and to the US, which
has complained that cartels are common in Japan, making foreign market
access difficult.
It is expected that the legislation will be presented to parliament later
this month.
