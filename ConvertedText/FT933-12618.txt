FT  23 JUL 93 / Workers accept toxic gas payouts


   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff


OUT-OF-COURT settlements of between Pounds 2,000 and Pounds 40,000 for
long-term health problems caused by exposure to carbon monoxide gas have
been accepted by 28 factory workers.
Mr John Pickering, of Irwin Mitchell, solicitors for the workers, said he
believed this was the first time compensation had been paid for such a level
of exposure.
The case, supported by the TGWU general union, was brought on behalf of the
workers who it was claimed were repeatedly exposed to high concentrations of
carbon monoxide from a leaking factory furnace between 1985 and 1986.
Symptoms following the exposure included headaches, nausea, aching shoulders
and constant fatigue, according to the solicitors. It said psychological
testing of the affected workers confirmed that many had sustained some
degree of brain damage.
The company, Backer Electric, of Rotherham, South Yorkshire, was then owned
by Hollis Engineering, in turn owned by the late Robert Maxwell.
The company is now owned by a private consortium, which said yesterday it
was not involved in the case.
