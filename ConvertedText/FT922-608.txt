FT  26 JUN 92 / Mine labour code signed


   By PHILIP GAWITH


SOUTH Africa's largest company, Anglo American Corporation, has signed a
ground-breaking labour relations agreement with the National Union of
Mineworkers (NUM), writes Philip Gawith.
The code of conduct accord is one of the most significant developments in
South African labour relations since the legalisation of black trade unions
in 1979.
The code, the first of its kind in the industry, is aimed at eliminating
violence in the mines and the violation of a wide range of labour and civil
rights. It applies to all gold and coal mines managed by Anglo.
At a signing ceremony this week, Mr Marcel Golding, assistant general
secretary of the NUM, which has more than 300,000 members, said the
agreements were of 'major historical significance'.
The code, and the accompanying agreement on dismissal and disputes
procedures, arose out of the bitter 1987 miners' strike.
