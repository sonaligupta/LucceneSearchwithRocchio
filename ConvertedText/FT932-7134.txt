FT  25 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Another blow for Zeneca


A CHANGED recommendation on Glaxo by a leading investment bank prompted a
turnaround in the stock and also added to market worries over prospects for
the Zeneca rights issue. The analyst's move highlighted the fragile nature
of the sector and the vulnerability of the impending Pounds 1.3bn rights
issue from Zeneca, the bioscience arm of ICI.
Glaxo was up 16p in the morning on the back of positive reports in the
weekend press. Then, Credit Suisse First Boston moved its recommendation to
sell from buy. The advice was aimed chiefly at US investors and when New
York opened, the shares ticked back in London to close unchanged at 629p.
Mr Robin Campbell of CSFB believes investors should be more concerned over
Glaxo's dependence on its ulcer drug Zantac, which is likely to be
threatened in the US by the arrival of cheaper rival products. He believes
the loss of Zantac sales could wipe Pounds 400m a year from Glaxo's total
turnover by 1995.
Potential sellers of pharmaceuticals stocks, which are already unsettled by
worries over US healthcare reforms, needed little further encouragement. Any
hopes that Zeneca might stage a recovery yesterday from recent weakness were
dashed as analysts and marketmakers began to express increasing concern
about next week's rights issue.
The Zeneca rights price of 600p a share contains a hefty 27.5p dividend but
if the ex-rights price falls below 600p there is every possibility that a
large amount of the shares offered will be left with the underwriters. Any
take-up of less than 80 per cent would result in a significant drag on the
stock and the sector. Zeneca ex-rights fell 3 to 622p while the nil-paid
lost 5 to 30p. ICI 'new' eased 2 to 622p and the existing ICI slid 3 to
1260p.
