FT  21 APR 94 / Midlands reports brighter prospects


   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent


Industrial companies in the Midlands expect to make higher profits this year
as the national economy regains some strength, according to a survey
published yesterday.
Singer & Friedlander, the merchant bank, said that just 7 per cent of 500
medium and large companies in the west Midlands expected profits this year
to be lower than in 1993.
The strongest expressions of confidence came from industrial, engineering
and construction companies, Singer said. The greater financial optimism
appears to have spilled over into the investment outlook - there is a
prospect of increased spending on plant at 66 per cent of companies.
Heightened prospects follow several months of slowly improving deliveries.
In the east Midlands, the Engineering Employers' Federation questioned 143
of its members and found that 60 per cent had increased deliveries in the
first quarter of this year over the final quarter of 1993.
However, less than half reported increasing order books. Mr Nigel Chubb, the
federation's director, said the outlook was still poor in the aerospace
equipment sector. Further, nearly 60 per cent of companies are working under
full capacity.
Meanwhile, manufacturing output in Northern Ireland increased 3.6 per cent
last year - double the national rate, according to government figures
released yesterday.
