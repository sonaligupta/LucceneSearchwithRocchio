FT  19 APR 94 / International Company News: Eli Lilly in alliance to extend
drug range


   By RICHARD WATERS


   NEW YORK


Eli Lilly has formed an alliance with Mylan, the generic drugs company, in a
move which signals a drive by US pharmaceuticals companies to extend the
range of products they sell.
Under the exclusive arrangement, Lilly will have the rights to sell Mylan's
anti-ulcer compound, Cimetidine, to its own managed care customers.
By filling out the range of drugs it sells, Lilly hopes to strengthen its
relationships with managed care organisations, which are becoming the
dominant buyers of drugs in the US.
Several drugs companies have also held talks which could lead to a
co-operative agreement to sell each others' products to health maintenance
organisations and other managed care customers.
Lilly's move marks the growing competition in the anti-ulcer market, which
is shaping up to become one of the most competitive in the US. In New York,
Lilly's shares closed Dollars 1 1/4 higher to Dollars 48 3/4 .
Tagamet, the prescription drug made by SmithKline Beecham, loses its patent
shortly, and Mylan's drug is set to become the first generic version to hit
the market.
At the same time Zantac, the Glaxo drug that is patented until the year
2002, is facing potential competition both from Cimetidine and other
generics.
Lilly also reported yesterday a 5 per cent increase in first-quarter sales,
to Dollars 1.64bn, compared with a year before. Operating income grew 2 per
cent.
However, net income for the period fell as a result of a higher tax rate and
a Dollars 56m charge related to the recall of some of the company's
anti-biotics. After-tax profits were Dollars 330.7m, or Dollars 1.14 a
share, down from Dollars 362.6m, or Dollars 1.27m (before the effect of
accounting changes) the year before.
