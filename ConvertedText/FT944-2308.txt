FT  16 DEC 94 / International Company News: Repola plans sale of up to 30%
of Rauma engineering unit

   STOCKHOLM


Repola, Finland's largest industrial group, yesterday announced plans to
sell up to 30 per cent of the shares in its wholly-owned Rauma engineering
subsidiary to outside investors.
It plans to list Rauma on the Helsinki stock exchange to create 'a more
independent and high profile position' for the unit. Repola's main operation
is its forestry operation, United Paper Mills, which accounts for nearly 70
per cent of overall annual turnover of about FM27bn (Dollars 5.5bn).
Rauma has four divisions: Timberjack (forest machines), Sunds Defibrator
(fibre technology), Neles-Jamesbury (industrial valves) and Nordberg
(crushers).
The decision to sell part of the unit comes at a time when demand is
improving in all four divisions due to economic recovery and an increase in
machinery orders in the pulp and paper sector.
The group is benefiting from its strong position in the North American and
Asia-Pacific markets.
Exports and overseas activities account for about 90 per cent of Rauma's
annual turnover of about FM8bn.
In the first eight months of 1994, Rauma doubled its operating profit to
FM247m from FM124m as turnover climbed by an underlying 9 per cent to
FM5.18bn.
The unit's order book at the end of August was up 75 per cent at FM4.81bn.
The Rauma shares, which will be sold to domestic and international investors
next year, may be listed on an overseas bourse at a later date. Advisers to
the issue are S. G. Warburg Securities and Prospectus Oy.
Repola's shares ended the day FM3.50 higher at FM85.50.
