FT  13 MAR 92 / Unemployment rate rises to 10.5% in Australia

AUSTRALIA'S unemployment rate rose to 10.5 per cent in February from a
revised level of 10.4 per cent a month earlier, according to figures
released yesterday.
Unemployment remained below the post-war record of 10.6 per cent, reached in
December, but the increase suggested that the slight fall in January was an
aberration.
Mr Kim Beazley, the employment minister, said unemployment was 'on track' to
reach 10.75 per cent in June, the level foreshadowed in the government's
budget last August. 'That is not a source of joy; it is not an acceptable
situation, and clearly we have to have policy settings right to bring that
down,' Mr Beazley said.
Economists said the fall in the number of employed people was slowing down,
although the improvement would not be sufficient to absorb increases in the
labour force over the next few months.
The expectations are that unemployment will peak at around 11 per cent
towards the end of the year. That would imply double digit figures in the
run up to the federal election, which must be held by mid-1993. Private
economists remain divided about whether recent improvements in some leading
indicators reflect the beginning of a recovery.
