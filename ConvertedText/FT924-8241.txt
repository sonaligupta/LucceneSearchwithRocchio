FT  12 NOV 92 / International Company News: Bethlehem Steel may sell
division


   By KAREN ZAGOR

BETHLEHEM Steel, the second biggest US steel group, may sell its bar, rod &
wire operations to Ispat Group of Calcutta.
Bethlehem, which said in January that it would sell the division, said the
discussions include the sale of the entire operations apart from the
Johnstown wire mill. It has agreed to sell the wire mill to TMB Industries
of Chicago.
The decision to sell the bar, rod and wire operations, which contribute less
than 10 per cent to Bethlehem's roughly Dollars 4bn annual sales, was
announced during the fourth quarter last year when Bethlehem turned in
losses of Dollars 638m, including a charge of Dollars 575m.
Before putting the operations on the block, Bethlehem had discussed
modernising the loss-making division with the United Steelworkers' union
(USW) for more than a year.
The decision to sell the business was made after the two sides failed to
agree on a new labour pact and Bethlehem said it could no longer consider
modernisation because of its deteriorating finances.
The division has been hit hard by intensifying competition from low-cost
mini-mills, which are increasing their share of the market for less
sophisticated products. Low priced imports have also hurt the operations.
