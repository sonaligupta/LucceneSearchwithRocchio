FT  07 JAN 94 / Observer: Be prepared


A word in the ear of young ones who say they don't need an education because

Pennsylvania, recently tried to purchase a Dollars 200 gold necklace with a
stolen credit card.
All was going smoothly until the shop assistant asked him to spell the name
on the card.
