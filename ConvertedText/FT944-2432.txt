FT  16 DEC 94 / Anglian drops universal metering


   By HAIG SIMONIAN, Environment Correspondent


Anglian Water, the water and sewerage company, has dropped its controversial
requirement for customers to have their water consumption metered.
Anglian has been alone among the water groups in pressing for universal
metering, in spite of the additional costs involved.
Metering, which is strongly supported by Ofwat, the industry regulator, is
seen by some observers to be a more equitable form of charging for water
consumption than the present system based on the old rateable values of
properties.
The water companies are all considering alternative methods of charging
before a deadline to revise tariff structures by the year 2000.
Anglian, which has 1.6m customers, will continue to install water meters but
will leave the choice of connection to householders.
Most water companies have come out strongly against metering on cost
grounds. But Anglian, which charges about 12.5 per cent of the households it
supplies based on metered water usage, says the extra costs must be balanced
against savings in capital expenditure which come through reduced
consumption.
The company said greater cost-consciousness among metered consumers could
bring savings of up to 15 per cent. Company policy is also affected by the
local climate: the Anglian region has one of the lowest rainfall rates in
the UK, making water conservation more important.
The group's compulsory metering policy has been widely criticised by
consumers' groups, which have argued that it penalises low income households
with large families.
