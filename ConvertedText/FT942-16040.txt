FT  12 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norwegian forecast increased

A fresh assessment of Norwegian oil and natural gas liquids prospects has
indicated that output will peak in 1996 at 2.85m barrels a day, about
350,000 b/d more than predicted earlier and 19 per cent above the 1993
level.
According to a study soon to be released by Wood Mackenzie, the
Edinburgh-based energy consultant, Norway will retain its number one ranking
among western European oil producers throughout the 1990s.
WoodMac forecast earlier this year that production would peak at a daily
rate of 2.5m barrels and that Britain might take over as western Europe's
top producer. But the new assessment sees Norway maintaining production
above 2.5m b/d throughout the 1990s. This will be achieved mainly by
extended peak contributions to overall output by the existing Statfjord,
Gullfaks, Oseberg and Snorre fields.
The consultant sees comparable UK production being maintained at a steady
level of 2.4m b/d during the 1994-96 period while Norway's output will go
from strength to strength, rising from 2.38m b/d in 1993 to 2.67m b/d this
year, and shooting up to 2.82m in 1995 and 2.85m in 1996. In 1996 new field
developments could be producing about 650,000 b/d, but existing fields are
still expected to account for over 75 per cent of total output.
Annual Norwegian gas sales are forecast to reach 63bn cubic metres by early
next century, more than double the 1993 level of 29bn cu m.
WoodMac says the level of forecast capital expenditure for Norwegian
offshore developments is significantly higher than estimated last year, when
it was thought that capital expenditure would decline steadily through the
1990s to about NKr20bn by the turn of the century from the 1993 peak of
NKr53bn.
'Despite the forecasted lower levels of future capital expenditure we
estimate that around NKr210bn (nominal) will be invested offshore Norway
over the next five years. Over NKr30bn per annum is expected to be spent
until after the year 2000,' WoodMac forecasts.
