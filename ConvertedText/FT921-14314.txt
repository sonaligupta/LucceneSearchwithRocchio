FT  16 JAN 92 / Observer: Sweet and sour


The Mersey Partnership could hardly have made a more tasteful choice than
John Billington to head its efforts to make the Liverpool basin more
palatable to investors, students, tourists and the like. When he's not
chairing the newly formed grouping of local authorities, government agencies
and business, he runs Edward Billington & Sons, one of Britain's three
remaining sugar merchants.
But his inaugural promises to refine the area's image met with a bitter
reverse. Even as he spoke, supporters of Militant were stirring up poll-tax
protests outside Liverpool magistrates' courts.
