FT  29 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Louis Newmark cuts loss to Pounds 187,000


The improving trend continued at Louis Newmark, the precision engineer and
watch distributor, with interim pre-tax losses cut from Pounds 526,000 to
Pounds 187,000.
Turnover for the half year to September 28 was lower at Pounds 12.2m (Pounds
20.2m), the result of the sale of the McMurdo reserve battery business and
the termination of the Swatch agency. Adjusting for these, manufacturing
turnover rose by 5 per cent and there was a 33 per cent fall in watch
merchandising.
Losses per share came out at 6.3p (11.5p).
