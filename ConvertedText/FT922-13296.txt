FT  13 APR 92 / Arts: Little Tramp


   By ANTONY THORNCROFT


The Haymarket Theatre in Basingstoke is about to close for a refurbishment.
Wanting to go out on a high note this agreeable venue's resident company,
the Horseshoe, is presenting the 'world premiere' of a musical about Charlie
Chaplin. Little Tramp was written - music, lyrics and co-libretto - David
Pomeranz, an American, and has been waiting some time for a public exposure.
I'm afraid the whole brave, ambitious, project is an exercise in
self-delusion.
Director Adrian Reynolds was bowled over by a tape of the music for the show
offered to him by an accountant, Colin Essex, whose company is sponsoring
the production. Peter Duncan, still best known as a Blue Peter presenter,
accepted the starring role. One fears that fantasies of a West End, nay
Broadway, transfer are as whimsical as Chaplin's Tramp.
There is one worthwhile moment - when Duncan invents the Little Tramp
character for the first time. He looks convincing. But then the performance
falls apart.
There is no attempt to re-create any of Chaplin's routines, to try to convey
his genius.
Instead there are banal lyrics, featureless songs, and unappealing acting.
Every character is a caricature - all policemen brutal, all journalists
venal, the rich all snobs, Chaplin's wives (apart from Oona) all gold
diggers. The production is subsumed in sentimentality as Chaplin's life is
tediously surveyed from honest London poverty to belated Hollywood honours
and his prickly personality sanitised.
In Alan Ayckbourn's plays misguided musicals are presented as a load of
laughs. There is not a smile to be raised from Little Tramp which stretches
three hours into a fair resemblance of Chaplin's near 90 years.
