FT  27 SEP 94 / Keating has little doubt Australia will be republic

   HOBART, TASMANIA


Australia's prime minister Paul Keating has 'little doubt' his countrymen
will endorse a move to make Australia a republic and sever its ties with the
British Crown, he said in Hobart yesterday.
Opinion polls suggest that a majority of Australians still support the
current constitutional structure, albeit by a declining margin.
But Mr Keating told the conference of his ruling Labor Party in Hobart that
'effectively we have handed the baton of the republic to the Australian
people.
'I am in little doubt that they will carry it across the line.
'A healthy debate is now under way,' he continued. 'We want to see the idea
of the republic become clearer in the public mind.
'As it becomes clearer, the resolve will grow stronger.'
The Australian Labor party subsequently confirmed its support for any
changes necessary to make Australia an independent republic by the year
2001.
In a wide-ranging keynote address to the ALP conference, Mr Keating placed
much emphasis on the importance to Australia's future of the 'information
superhighway' and on the increasing trade links with the Asia-Pacific
region.
The meeting of the leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum
in November, he said, was 'of profound importance to Australia's exporters,
farmers and workers. No one can estimate what even modest success with Apec
might be worth.'
The necessary ALP approval for proposed privatisation of the 22 airports run
by the Federal Airports Corporation is likely to be forthcoming today after
hectic backroom dealing in Hobart.
However, the airports will probably be sold on a piecemeal basis rather than
as a group, and on 50-year leases.
There is also likely to be a cap on foreign ownership of 49 per cent.
