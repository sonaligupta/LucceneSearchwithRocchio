FT  15 DEC 94 / International Company News: Stock options ruling spares
company profits


   By RICHARD WATERS


   NEW YORK


A controversial accounting proposal that would have required US companies to
deduct the cost of stock options from their profits was dropped yesterday.
Members of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which sets standards
for the profession, voted by five to two not to force companies to make the
charges against earnings.
The plan had come under fire in corporate and accounting circles.
Critics had complained of the difficulty of measuring the true cost of
options, as well as the effect the deductions would have had on the profits
of some companies, particularly small, fast-growing ones.
The FASB's vote follows an angry 18-month debate over the issue. The
regulators had contended that share options issued to a company's directors
and staff were similar to other forms of compensation benefit, and that
their costs should be deducted from a company's profits.
Yesterday, Mr Dennis Beresford, the board chairman, said: 'The board remains
convinced that employee options have value and are compensation. However, in
the final analysis, the board decided that there simply isn't enough support
for the basic notion of requiring expense recognition.'
Instead, the FASB said it would allow companies the choice of taking a
charge against profits, or simply disclosing in a note the effect on profits
that would have resulted from adopting the FASB guidelines for valuing
options.
The board said it 'expects to encourage, rather than require', companies to
use the first choice.
The board added that it had yet to decide whether to issue a new accounting
standard without further public comment, or whether to go through a new
consultative process. The decision is likely to be made in the second
quarter of next year.
