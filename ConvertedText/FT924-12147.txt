Software:  TSB Group's mulitmedia training courses use interactive videos
developed in-house entitled A Question of Business (1987) and A Case of
Disappearing Pills (1989).  A third video, a French course for schools, has
been sponsored by TSB Group Community Project. TSB RBI also uses published
programs such as Longman's Caring for Your Customer.
Hardware:  Eight Sony laser disk players in the TSB college; 12 IBM
286-based PCs.  Sony monitors on the PCs are able to display computer-
screen messages and video simultaneously.  There are 80 Sony view systems in
the TSB RBI centres.
Cost of project:  The original interactive video project in 1986 cost around
Pounds 50,000 including the casting, acting and filming, and the use of
various production consultants.  The initial investment in hardware for
running the videos (as opposed to developing them) amounted to Pounds
18,000.  About Pounds 30,000 was spent on contractor services.  Two college
employees worked full-time on the project but more were involved in the
research, interviewing and assessment.
