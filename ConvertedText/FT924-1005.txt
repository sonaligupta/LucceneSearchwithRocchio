FT  21 DEC 92 / Rome set to give details of sell-off

   ROME


THE Italian government is expected this week to release full details of its
privatisation programme, after the broad endorsement last week from the two
houses of parliament.
Approval was given by the chamber of deputies on Wednesday and the senate on
Friday to a programme which aims to raise L27,000bn (Pounds 12.8bn) for the
treasury between 1993 and 1995. In addition IRI, the state holding company,
is expected to raise some L12,000bn from its own divestments which will go
to recapitalise and repay debts.
Parliamentary backing came despite powerful lobbying by Christian Democrat
and Socialist politicians on their own coalition to water down the scheme so
that the parties could retain control over a large state-controlled economy.
'This is an important step forward,' a treasury official said. However, the
official pointed out that parliament had laid down a number of guidelines
which the government had to take into consideration. Mr Piero Barucci, the
treasury minister, who is master-minding privatisation with Mr Giuliano
Amato, the prime minister, pledged a definite plan for privatisation would
be ready before the end of the year.
The broad privatisation proposals were submitted to parliament a month ago
on a consultative basis. One of the main recommendations is that
privatisation be carried out under the aegis of the prime minister and a
committee of three ministers (treasury, budget and industry) who would also
liaise with a new ministry of production. The latter is an attempt by
parliament to force the government to include an industrial strategy in the
privatisation process and not simply sell off to raise money for the
impoverished treasury.
