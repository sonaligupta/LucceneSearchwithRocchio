FT  16 JUN 93 / French waste paper collectors protest over German imports


   By REUTER


French waste paper collectors jammed traffic in parts of Paris yesterday
morning in a protest over German imports which have driven down the prices
they obtain from paper manufacturers using recyclable products, Reuter
reports. They blocked several main roads with trucks and piles of old paper
and cardboard. Paper collection companies say 27,000 jobs in the industry
are threatened.
