FT  20 APR 94 / International Company News: Five-minute film service planned
for next year


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


A company that can download a full-length feature film in five minutes by
satellite to specially-adapted video recorders is planning to launch its
movie service in Japan, the US, and Europe next year.
Mr Will Graven, chairman of EMC3 International Holdings, said yesterday he
has signed letters of intent with seven Japanese and Korean video recorder
manufacturers, with three more agreements in the pipeline.
Mr Graven has been working on his concept of creating an 'electronic video
store in the sky' for more than six years, and now believes he is close to
pulling it off.
Sharp, the Japanese consumer electronics group, is the latest video recorder
manufacturer to sign a letter of intent, express excitement about the idea
and agree to explore and finalise a standard before preparing to
manufacture.
Under the EMC3 concept of providing 'near real-time' videos, a customer
orders a title from a catalogue by telephone or key pad and it is delivered
by satellite in a digital 'electronic burst'.
The machine, which is likely to cost around Dollars 250 more than a
conventional video recorder at the outset, slows down the 'five-minute'
recording to provide 100 minutes of viewing time.
Macrovision, the anti-piracy specialist, is a minority shareholders in EMC3
and its system will be used to prevent illegal copying.
