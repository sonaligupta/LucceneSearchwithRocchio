FT  26 MAY 93 / GE and Hitachi plan gas turbine


   By ANDREW BAXTER


General Electric of the US and Hitachi of Japan are to work together to
produce a medium-sized gas turbine, designed for utility, industrial and
co-generation applications in the 70MW-110MW range worldwide, Andrew Baxter
writes.
The deal is an important extension of the long-standing relationship between
the two companies. Hitachi, which is a member of GE's network of gas turbine
business associates, will participate in the scaling-down of GE's 159MW 7FA
turbine to create the new machine, the 6FA.
