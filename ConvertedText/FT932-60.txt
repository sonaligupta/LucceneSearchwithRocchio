FT  30 JUN 93 / International Capital Markets: DTB introduces further cuts
in transaction fees


   By DAVID WALLER


   FRANKFURT


THE Deutsche Terminborse (DTB), the German screen-based futures and options
market, will tomorrow introduce a further round of cuts in transaction fees.
Following on from a round of fee cuts last year, fees on stock and index
instruments for investors and market-makers will be cut by an average of 23
per cent, Mr Jorg Franke, one of the exchange's two chief executives, said
yesterday.
Mr Franke said the fee reductions did not extend to products based on debt
instruments. The move is aimed especially at private investors, who are
mainly drawn to stock and index-linked products, he said. The cuts are also
a way of sharing the profitability of the exchange with investors, he said.
Pre-tax profits at the DTB nearly trebled to DM42.2m (Dollars 25.4m) last
year, reflecting a reduction in costs as well as higher income due to
heavily increased trading volume.
Mr Franke reported that the number of contracts handled by the DTB had risen
by 50 per cent to 21.11m in the period to June 25 this year.
DTB's strategy for 1993 is based to a large extent on further expansion
abroad: in May this year, trading screens went on-line in Amsterdam and,
according to Mr Franke, demand from institutions in other financial centres
is high. But as Mr Gerhard Eberstadt, DTB chairman, has recently stressed,
the lack of a central regulatory body for the German securities industry
hampers the exchange's plans to expand abroad.
The DTB said that plans to link with Matif, the French futures and options
exchange, were moving ahead on schedule. The aim is to finalise the
co-operation agreement for consideration by the two exchanges by the end of
the summer.
