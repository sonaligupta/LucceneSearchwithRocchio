Estonia's last communist prime minister, Mr Indrek Toome, now a powerful
business figure, has been detained for allegedly attempting to bribe a
police officer, it was reported yesterday. Mr Toome, 51, was arrested on
Monday for allegedly offering Dollars 2,400 in bribes to secure fraud-ulent
passports for Russian business associates. During a search of his apartment
on Monday, police also found a large box of machine gun bullets, which they
said he possessed illegally.
Mr Toome, who served as prime minister from 1988 to 1990, is expected to
remain in prison for 10 days while investigators gather evidence. If
convicted of bribery, he faces a maximum two-year prison sentence. Earlier
this year, Mr Toome and Finnish business associates bought the 22-story Viru
Hotel for Dollars 1m at a state-run auction. The sale price of the Viru, one
of Estonia's most sought-after properties, was criticised for being too low.
