FT  25 MAR 92 / Election 1992: PM sees basis for recovery


   By IVOR OWEN


BRITAIN'S economy was poised to come out of recession 'in the right way'
with low inflation, a stable exchange rate and a continuing flow of inward
investment, Mr John Major said last night, Ivor Owen writes.
The prime minister gave an upbeat assessment of prospects for the economy
and for the Conservatives' chances of securing a fourth successive general
election victory when interviewed on BBC's Newsnight programme.
Mr Major said most economists agreed with the government's judgment that
Britain's annual inflation rate would be less than 4 per cent next year, and
would continue to fall.
