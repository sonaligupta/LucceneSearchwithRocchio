   By REUTER


   BRUSSELS


The European Commission is in the process of cutting its forecast that
European Community economies will grow at an average rate of 1.8 per cent
next year, an official said, Reuter reports from Brussels.
'We expect that it will be above 1 per cent, but only just,' the official
said, adding that the Commission had also begun pushing back the timing of
the expected economic upturn from the second half of this year to the first
half of 1994.
