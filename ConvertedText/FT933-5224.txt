FT  04 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Beauford puts Dale into receivership


Beauford has requested a receiver be appointed at Dale Group, its mining
equipment subsidiary. The remaining companies in the Beauford group are not
affected.
The decision had become inevitable, said Beauford, as 60 per cent of Dale's
sales were with British Coal.
The deteriorating economic climate there and the real threat of accelerated
pit closures had made it necessary to concentrate financial resources in
stable or expanding markets.
