FT  16 MAR 94 / International Company News: Avesta aims to raise SKr600m

Avesta Sheffield, the Swedish-British steel producer, yesterday announced a
SKr600m rights issue to back a programme of investments and restructuring
designed to strengthen the group further after cutting losses sharply in
1993.
The company, formed in late 1992 from a merger of Avesta with the stainless
steel interests of British Steel, said losses after financial items were
reduced to SKr98m (Dollars 12.48m) last year from SKr574m in 1992. Sales
were up 20 per cent to SKr14.2bn.
It said the improvement came in spite of generally weak demand, especially
for its cold rolled products, hot rolled steel plate and tubes.
The reduced losses were attributed chiefly to merger synergies, the fall in
value of the Swedish and British currencies and reduced employers
contributions and energy taxes in Sweden.
No dividend will be paid, as was the case last year.
In January the company secured a five-year syndicated bank loan of Dollars
268.75m. The new financing will bolster Avesta Sheffield - 40 per cent owned
by British Steel - as it implements a SKr600m investment and restructuring
plan, provision for which was made in the 1993 accounts.
The plans include investment in a new continuous plate production plant in
the US and the upgrading of melting shops in Sheffield and Avesta.
A melting shop in Degerfors in Sweden is to be closed down.
Avesta Sheffield said overcapacity in Europe continued to depress short and
medium-term prospects for stainless steel, but stronger demand in the Far
East and the US supported a forecast of long-term growth in consumption of
4-5 per cent a year.
The company's investment and restructuring plan should give a quick return
by increasing productivity, reducing lead times and improving costs, it
said.
