FT  15 JUN 93 / Observer: Tied down


Health secretary Virginia Bottomley has an easy way of spotting when husband
Peter, one of the looser cannons on the Tory back benches, is going to cause
trouble. He comes down to breakfast sporting his splendid Transport and
General Workers' Union tie.
Yesterday was no exception. Suitably attired, Comrade Bottomley attended the
launch of a TUC-led campaign against a particularly blatant union-bashing
amendment which has suddenly surfaced in the employment bill, due to be
debated in the Commons today.
With much reference to Tolpuddle Martyrs, Bottomley easily outshone John
Monks, TUC deputy general secretary, in the depth of emotion he showed in
favour of trade union rights and contempt for anyone who dared tamper with
them. Stanley Baldwin might have sympathised, but it can hardly have gone
down well with the current generation of Tory bosses.
As for the TGWU, Britain's biggest blue-collar union, it is not making a big
thing about its new star campaigner. 'He's not our most illustrious member,'
sniffs an official. 'That would be the Queen Mother. She wanted to become an
honorary bummarree (porter) when she visited Smithfield market, and she was
issued with a T&G card there and then.'
