FT  21 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Too costly to dress up


   From D A OGILVIE-WARD


I read with dismay Clement Crisp's pompous article (Arts: 'The decline and
fall of elegance', July 18) about dressing up for Covent Garden.
I would love to dress up to go to Covent Garden, but as I have to buy my own
ticket to attend the Royal Opera House (and also English National Opera) on
a regular basis, I am only able to afford a seat in the lower or upper slips
if I wish to see all the new and the old operas. As an office worker, there
is not enough time for me to have a meal before the performance; and, as I
have to leave promptly at the end to catch a late train home, I picnic on
the stairs in the interval (this also keeps my costs down for the evening).
Besides, there are often long queues in the smoke-filled bars.
In the circumstances, I prefer to be a regular opera-goer even if it means
sitting in a cheap seat - among the real opera buffs who go to see and not
to be seen]
