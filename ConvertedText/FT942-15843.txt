FT  13 APR 94 / UK Company News: Dewhirst 48% ahead to Pounds 9.6m


   By PEGGY HOLLINGER


Dewhirst shares jumped 9p to 114p yesterday as the Marks and Spencer
clothing supplier announced better-than-expected annual profits and rewarded
shareholders with a 45 per cent increase in the dividend.
Mr Tim Dewhirst, chairman, praised the achievements made over the year to
January 14, which saw a 48 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds
9.6m on sales 18 per cent higher at Pounds 214.1m. 'If anyone had submitted
a budget with these numbers to me I would have thought they were naive,' he
said.
The final dividend, which had been cut substantially in 1991, is being
raised from 0.68p to 1.05p for a total of 1.45p (1p).
Margins improved from 3.9 per cent to 4.5 per cent. Mr Dewhirst was
confident that the operating margin would increase again this year.
Almost three years ago, Dewhirst set out on a programme of reorganisation
aimed at bringing margins to 7 per cent within five years. The company was
well on target, Mr Dewhirst said.
Sales to M&S, which takes about 85 per cent of Dewhirst's turnover,
increased by more than 25 per cent during the year. Sales of ladies wear
rose by 42 per cent, men's wear by 21 per cent and children's clothes by 12
per cent.
The children's wear business had incurred losses last year, but was expected
to breakeven in 1994 after a wide-ranging restructuring.
Mr Dewhirst said the company remained committed to being focused on
supplying M&S. It would seek to grow organically by extending the range of
products within M&S stores.
Total clothing profits rose by 25 per cent to Pounds 7.95m pre-taxon sales
ahead from Pounds 157.2m to Pounds 188.1m.
The toiletries division more than doubled profits from Pounds 702,000 to
Pounds 1.71m on sales up 6 per cent to Pounds 26m. Margins were helped by a
more selective approach to customers.
COMMENT
Dewhirst appears to be reaping the benefits of a new management. While many
praised the work on margins it would have been suicide for Dewhirst to have
done otherwise. The real achievement has been in increasing volumes.
Dewhirst has gobbled up market share through improving its product range and
efficiency. The main restructuring is now out of the way and 7 per cent
margins may well be achieved before the self-imposed deadline. Forecasts are
for Pounds 13.2m pre-tax, putting the shares on a still-attractive p/e of
16.
