FT  16 JAN 92 / MEPs block aid to Syria and Morocco

THE European Parliament last night approved Ecu1.58bn (Pounds 1.13bn) worth
of aid to several North African and Middle East countries, but blocked a
further Ecu773m for Syria and Morocco because of human rights abuses there.
The package of grants and loans, covering the period up to 1996, is the key
element in the Community's strategy to increase stability to its south and
east, as well as to underpin Middle East peace efforts.
Surprisingly, aid to Algeria and Israel was approved. In the case of the
former, MEPs urged the Commission to monitor closely the situation following
a decision by Algeria's government and army to cancel a further round of
voting this week, after successes by Islamic fundamentalists.
Aid to Israel, worth a relatively small Ecu82m, scraped through with most
MEPs wanting to give even-handed backing to the Arab-Israeli peace process
and to match the funding they also approved yesterday for Jordan and
Lebanon.
Irrespective of the Middle East peace drive, however, MEPs' complaints about
human rights abuses in Syria doomed Brussels' plan to conclude a
much-delayed third financial protocol of Ecu152m, and a fourth protocol
worth Ecu158m, with that country.
More surprising, particularly in view of yesterday's treatment of Algeria,
was the voting down of Ecu463m for Morocco.
