FT  17 JAN 92 / Technology: FDA sets record on approvals


   By DANIEL GREEN


The time taken for new drugs to be approved in the US is falling quickly,
according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the government agency
which controls what goes on sale in the Dollars 60bn (Pounds 33.5bn) a year
US drugs market.
It is also pushing through 43 per cent more products: 327 in 1991, compared
with 229 in 1990. Among these was a greater number of new molecular entities
(NMEs) - drugs with distinctly different structures from those already on
the market - than ever before.
The FDA has been under pressure for some years over the time taken to
approve drugs. The Waxman-Hatch act of 1984, for example, cut the time for
approval of generic (non-patent) drugs. The drug industry lobby has since
stepped up the pressure on the FDA for early approval.
In 1991, the average time taken for the top 30 new drugs, the NMEs, to be
given the green light was 22.1 months, a 9 per cent improvement on 1990. The
top 30 includes Glaxo's Zofran, used for treating nausea in cancer
chemotherapy patients. Only 23 NMEs were approved in 1990.
For the five most important drugs, those identified as providing the
greatest therapeutic improvement over existing treatment, the time was 11.4
months, about half the level two years ago.
These included Videx, Bristol Myers Squibb's Aids treatment. It was approved
in six months, failing to beat the three-month record set in 1987 by the
only other approved Aids drug, Retrovir, made by UK company Wellcome.
The Aids lobby has been at the forefront of pressure on the FDA to speed up
the approvals process. Some 194 drugs were not given approval, either as
outright rejections or withdrawn by the makers.
If the FDA's performance is improving, then its figures indicate the drug
makers are standing still. It took an average of 7.3 years for one of the
top 30 drugs to go from the first clinical trials to approval in 1991. In
1990, the figure was 7.9 years and in 1989, 7.4 years.
