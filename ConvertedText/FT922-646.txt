FT  26 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee talks make little
progress


   By DAVID BLACKWELL


TALKS ON a new international coffee agreement did not appear likely
yesterday to come up with any conclusions that could halt the downward
spiral in prices.
London's robusta coffee market was quiet, awaiting developments at the
International Coffee Organisation, where the talks are due to end this
evening.
The momentum towards a new agreement has undoubtedly gathered pace since
March, when the Brazilian exporters decided to end their opposition to
export quotas.
Since ICO talks in April ended inconclusively producers have had meetings to
try to hammer out a policy, but consumers have not met.
Yesterday delegates were wrestling with the problems of so-called
selectivity, which aims to classify coffee in order to give consumers choice
over which type they import. The mood was better than early in the week,
but, in the words of one producer, the talks were 'like jogging on the
spot'.
