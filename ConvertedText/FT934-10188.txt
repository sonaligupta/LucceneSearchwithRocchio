FT  06 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets: Mexico


MEXICO fell, pressured by a fall in Telefonos de Mexico. The BMV index
dropped 43.91 or 2.18 per cent to 1,968.07, after climbing from a session
low of 1,950.41. Traders blamed a Wall Street Journal story which, they
said, cast doubt on the growth prospects of the Telmex share price. Telmex A
fell by 260 pesos, or 3.1 per cent, to 8,180 pesos.
