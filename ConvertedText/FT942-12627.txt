FT  28 APR 94 / International Company News: Martin Marietta stirs takeover
speculation


   By RICHARD TOMKINS


   NEW YORK


Martin Marietta, the US defence contractor that failed in its takeover bid
for the smaller Grumman defence company earlier this month, yesterday
stirred up speculation about its next target by describing the sort of
company it wanted to buy.
It said it was seeking acquisitions with annual revenues of about Dollars
1bn, and was especially interested in companies involved in high technology,
information systems and engineering.
Mr Norman Augustine, chairman, also teased speculators by hinting that the
company might be seeking to enter the airframe business because many other
large manufacturers had pulled out of the sector recently.
'Clearly, six (airframe manufacturers) may have been too many,' Mr Augustine
told shareholders at the annual meeting in Atlanta, 'but the industry has
now shrunk enough that it's beginning to be a viable business.'
He made it clear Martin Marietta was still aggressively seeking acquisitions
to fuel growth in a shrinking defence industry.
In February, Martin Marietta, which last year bought General Electric's
aerospace division for Dollars 3.05bn and General Dynamics' space launch
business for Dollars 208.5m, made a Dollars 1.93bn friendly takeover offer
for Grumman. However, it lost the acquisition to Northrop which made a
higher offer.
The Grumman takeover was the latest in a series of moves that have come with
the consolidation of the US defence industry, which has been struggling with
sharply-lower Pentagon spending since the collapse of the Soviet empire. Mr
Augustine predicted the industry shake-out would continue until at least
1997.
