FT  12 APR 94 / UK Company News: AH Ball warns of impending loss


AH Ball, the civil engineer, warned that trading in the year to end-March
1994 would result in a loss, and that it was doubtful it would pay a final
dividend.
The company said it had been adversely affected by losses incurred on two
period schedule and one specific contract.
The directors said that although they were confident that trading in the
group would recover satisfactorily in the current year, they felt it would
benefit from becoming part of a larger organisation.
