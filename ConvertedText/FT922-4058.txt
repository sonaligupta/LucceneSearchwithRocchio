FT  08 JUN 92 / Post-election enthusiasm wanes for UK shares


   By TERRY BYLAND


THE RAPID fading of post-election enthusiasm in the UK stock market has been
confirmed in a survey of UK fund managers by the Gallup polling organisation
on behalf of Smith New Court, the London-based integrated and international
securities house.
A balance of 15 per cent of senior fund managers in the survey this month
expected to increase their holdings of UK equities, compared with 18 per
cent last month, and 49 per cent at the beginning of April when the London
market was awaiting the general election.
The survey reinforces the trend towards increased investment in Japanese and
European equities at the expense of US stocks.
The balance of those taking a bullish view of the FT-SE Index over the
coming three months has fallen from 32 per cent in May to only 12 per cent.
A Footsie of 2,990 is predicted for June 1993, compared with Friday's close
of 2,668.5. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is seen at 3,458 in 12 months,
against Friday's 3,398.69.
Those planning to sell US equities have jumped from 25 per cent in May to 37
per cent in June. Prospective buyers of European equities increased their
net dominance from 16 per cent to 22 per cent, while prospective buyers of
Japanese shares remain in a majority, albeit down from 37 per cent to 29 per
cent.
Senior representatives of 100 fund management groups handling funds
totalling Pounds 498bn took part in the survey.
