FT  15 APR 94 / World Stock Markets: German turnover picks up sharply


   By MICHAEL MORGAN


Equity trading picked up in Europe during March as most market indices
continued their decline and the FT-A Europe index was marked 4.2 per cent
lower after its 4.4 per cent fall in February.
Mr James Cornish at NatWest Securities says this suggests that selling
pressure increased once it became clear that there would be no early let-up
in the fall of US Treasury bond prices, which remains the main bearish
influence.
Mr Cornish notes the clear involvement of international investors,
demonstrated by a 16.2 per cent rise in the volume of European stocks traded
on Seaq International, the London screen based system, as a proportion of
turnover in continental domestic markets. Seaq trading accounted for 16.1
per cent in February and 15.2 per cent in January.
German turnover showed the largest gain in March, rising by a hefty 21.6 per
cent after February's 19.5 per cent decline as the Dax index went against
the general trend and registered a 1.2 per cent advance.
Hoare Govett notes that the major sectoral theme in March was the strength
of the cyclical sectors, particularly chemicals and motor manufacturers, at
the expense of financials. In the case of chemicals, outperformance of
almost 5 per cent had reflected generally encouraging earnings and dividends
statements and better prospects for 1994; for car-makers, investors
continued to anticipate a recovery, although there was little sign of one
yet.
Spain's 6.5 per cent rise in March turnover was in sharp contrast to the
market's worse than average 5.9 per cent fall. A 6.8 per cent rise in
average turnover for the previous three months suggested that selling
pressure was accelerating.
Amsterdam saw domestic turnover rise 3.4 per cent in March, and 7.5 per cent
over the average for the previous three months, as the market index fell 5.5
per cent. However, trading on Seaq International of Dutch shares surged 43
per cent, underlining the particular interest in London in Royal Dutch and
the other large international companies.
Separately, the Amsterdam stock exchange reported that total trading of
equities and bonds reached a new high of Fl 134.5bn in March, taking first
quarter turnover to Fl 356.1bn, up 43 per cent over the same 1993 period.
The exchange notes that the month saw a heavy flow of new share issues,
including those from Pakhoed, Pirelli and KLM, while the market was also
driven by a hefty calender of corporate results.
Milan turnover edged 1.6 per cent higher in March to another record after
the 46.7 per cent surge the previous month, making it the third most heavily
traded European market after Frankfurt and London for the second consecutive
month.
Kleinwort Benson notes that the market was surprisingly firm in the run up
to the elections, apparently acknowledging that a new government would be
forced to continue the economic policies of the previous administration,
whatever its political complexion. The telecom shares were a major driving
force ahead of the announcement of the restructuring plan for the sector and
strong domestic funds flows were also a significant factor.
Zurich and Paris were losers in March, but the sharpest decline was seen in
Brussels where turnover dipped by 12.5 per cent while the market itself
slipped by only 2.7 per cent.
