FT  28 SEP 94 / Whitehall reforms may be extended


   By JAMES BLITZ


Mr David Hunt, the minister for public service and science, yesterday
signalled that he would press ahead with long-term plans to reform
Whitehall, bringing in the private sector to provide public services
wherever possible, James Blitz writes.
Mr Hunt defended the need for public-sector organisations, saying the
government was determined to improve their responsibility and effectiveness.
He gave full backing to attempts by Whitehall's 100 agencies to introduce
greater commercial discipline through market testing and tendering.
Mr Hunt also gave a strong indication that the government would seek to
privatise some executive agencies before the next general election.
Addressing agency chief executives in London yesterday, Mr Hunt denied that
the Public Service Charter and the 'Next Steps' reforms were 'anti-public
service'. He said: 'We want better, more responsive public services, and the
government values public servants.'
The government has so far privatised only one agency - DVOIT, the
information technology unit of the Department of Transport.
