FT  30 JUN 93 / International Company News: Setback at General Mills


   By NIKKI TAIT


   NEW YORK


GENERAL Mills, the US food manufacturer and restaurant operator, yesterday
reported a fall in fourth-quarter after-tax profits in the three months to
May 30 to Dollars 67.5m from Dollars 93.1m, on unchanged sales of Dollars
2bn. Net income for the year was Dollars 506.1m, against Dollars 495.6m in
the previous 12 months.
The figures were struck after a Dollars 57.3m restructuring charge which
General Mills says should generate about Dollars 15m of annual after-tax
savings in 1994.
The company calculates that, excluding this item, earnings per share in the
12-month period would have risen about 13 per cent to Dollars 3.45.
Both the main divisions, consumer foods and restaurants, posted operating
gains of around 11 per cent during the year.
