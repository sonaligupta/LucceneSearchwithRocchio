DYNO INDUSTRIER, the diversified Norwegian group with main interests in
chemicals, has reported flat first-half pre-tax profits of NKr154m, (Dollars
26.4m) and warned of little increase in sales in the second six months.
Operating profits edged ahead in the first half to NKr254m from NKr249m a
year earlier, on turnover of NKr3.83bn, against NKr3.93bn.
The company warned that it was unlikely that markets for Dyno's main
products would improve significantly during the remainder of the year.
Improved profits had to be achieved through restructuring and
rationalisation measures.
Mr Tom Jebsen, executive, said Dyno was in the middle of a restructuring
programme which had seen the closure of an explosives plant in the US and
three plastics plants in Scandinavia. Work was under way to close a domestic
powder resins production plant.
Group operating expenses in the first six months of this year were reduced
by NKr100m to NKr3.36bn.
Group second-quarter pre-tax profit fell by NKr17m to NKr107m. Operating
profit declined by NKr17m to NKr134m while revenue slid to NKr1.95bn from
NKr2.08bn.
