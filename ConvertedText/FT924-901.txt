FT  21 DEC 92 / Latin American inflation in check

MOST OF Latin America experienced strong growth and greater price stability
during 1992, with the main exception of Brazil, which continues to buck the
regional trend towards recovery, the United Nation's Economic Commission for
Latin America and the Caribbean said yesterday.
Six countries - Argentina, Chile, Panama, the Dominican Republic, Uruguay
and Venezuela - achieved real growth rates of 6 per cent or more. Brazil,
Barbados, Peru and Haiti suffered downturns.
The depth of the Brazilian recession acted as a drag on the performance of
the region as a whole. ECLAC estimated regional GDP to have grown by 2.4 per
cent in 1992, compared with 3.5 per cent last year. Without Brazil, 1992
growth was 4.3 per cent.
Six countries reduced inflation to single digits; another 16 countries kept
consumer price rises below 20 per cent. Only Brazil continued to struggle
with triple-digit inflation.
Mr Gert Rosenthal, ECLAC's secretary general, said the region's economic
progress was 'no mean feat' considering the recession and uncertainty
gripping Latin America's trading partners in the industrialised world. He
noted that regional exports - totalling Dollars 126bn (Pounds 82.8bn) in
1992 - continued to grow despite declining terms of trade for Latin
America's main commodities.
