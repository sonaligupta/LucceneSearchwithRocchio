FT  22 JUL 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool


The Australian Wool Realisation Commission has for two weeks reported
relatively heavy sales, reaching almost 25,000 bales. Buyers needed to cover
sales to China, transacted in Australia and in types and for delivery which
clearly meant using the stockpile as a source of supply. In the latest week
Russia was mentioned as a buyer, at normal premium prices and with payment
before release of the wool. Though the quantity was small at 3,500 bales
this is being taken as a hopeful market pointer for when auctions are
resumed.
