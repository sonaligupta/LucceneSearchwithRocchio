FT  15 APR 94 / Management: Learn your PLC


   By TIM DICKSON


A first invitation to join the board of a listed company is an exciting
opportunity for anyone in business. But the post carries additional
responsibilities and increased duties as well as prestige.
That is why the UK's Institute of Directors - increasingly vocal this year
on the subject of raising board standards - is today launching a new two-day
course expressly devised for recently appointed and prospective directors of
publicly quoted UK companies.
There are already numerous general courses on the UK market, including those
run by the IOD, aimed at training company directors. John Harper,
professional development director at the IOD, claims this is the first to
address the special issues faced by listed company boards. He estimates that
there are 15,000 to 20,000 directors of UK publicly quoted companies.
Capital markets and financing options, insider trading rules, shareholder
value and dividend policy, investor relations and opinions, internal audits,
board committees and preparing reports and accounts are just some of the
subjects that will be covered on the course.
Joining The PLC Board has been developed by a team from the IOD, Henley and
Ashridge management colleges, and Manchester Business School, with advice
and input from several FT-SE 100 companies. The two days, running from
Thursday lunchtime to Saturday lunchtime, will be split into nine modules -
each led by an experienced business or City figure and an academic.
The first of the three courses planned for 1994 - price Pounds 2,250 plus
VAT for tuition, accommodation, course material and meals - will be held at
Henley, starting June 16. The others are at Manchester in September and at
Ashridge in November. Details from the Centre for Director Development,
Institute of Directors, 116 Pall Mall, London SW1Y 5ED.
