FT  26 JUN 92 / International Company News: Bosch checks slide in earnings


   By ANDREW FISHER

ROBERT BOSCH, the German automotive components, telecommunications and
engineering group, is continuing its cost-cutting and productivity drive in
the face of intensifying world competition, although the slide in profits
has been checked, said Mr Marcus Bierich, the chief executive.
He reported a 3.5 per cent drop in net profits last year to DM540m (Dollars
338m), with turnover nearly 6 per cent higher at DM33.6bn. This followed a
steeper decline of almost 10 per cent in earnings to DM560m during 1990.
Mr Bierich said that turnover had improved by 5.4 per cent to DM14.3bn in
the first five months of 1992, with the percentage rise for the full year
likely to be about the same as last year. But this forecast was laden with
'considerable uncertainties' in view of the worldwide political and economic
situation.
The sharp drop in profits that had begun in 1990 was halted in the course of
1991, he said. But customers were still putting pressure on prices - this
has been especially true on the motor components side - and Bosch was no
longer able to pass on its higher labour costs to purchasers of its
products.
Some 4,000 jobs were shed last year within the Bosch group, which employed
177,000 people at the end of 1991. Excluding the additions from new
acquisitions, however, the decline was 8,000. A further 1,500 jobs had gone
so far this year through non-replacement of those leaving and early
retirements.
Mr Bierich said that the latest wage deal in the engineering industry would
raise domestic labour costs per hour by an average 5.5 per cent a year.
Since competition was too tough to allow more than minimal price rises,
productivity would have to rise at this rate to maintain profits and enable
Bosch to remain independent.
This meant no overall rise in group employment and further job cuts in
sectors with weak profits or poor growth.
