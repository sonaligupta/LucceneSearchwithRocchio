FT  22 OCT 94 / Bonn in call for continued support


   By BRUCE CLARK


Germany will continue to need Nato and US support for its defence because of
Russia's military strength and the uncertain prospects for democracy, the
head of the German defence staff said yesterday.
In a speech to the Royal United Services Institute, Gen Klaus Naumann gave a
strikingly downbeat view of the chances of stability or prosperity in the
former Soviet Union.
He described Russia as a country 'taking a giant step from feudalism to
democracy without ever having gone through the experience of enlightenment'.
'Stability and democracy are linked with economic prosperity, and the
Russian economy . . . is far away from recovery, and hence we should not be
too optimistic in our assessment,' the defence chief said.
He told the institute: 'In the presumably long process of disintegration and
reconstruction (in the former Soviet Union) we are likely to see further
reversals . . . and more violence than we are now seeing in the almost
forgotten wars of Caucasus.'
Gen Naumann said that even if existing disarmament treaties were observed,
Russia would still have more than 3,200 strategic nuclear warheads and an
army of 1.5m men which Mr Yeltsin had promised to supply generously.
He was presenting to the institute his country's plans to develop a global
rapid reaction capacity, including the ability to deploy one army division
anywhere in the world within less than a month. He stressed that Germany did
not expect to engage in such missions alone.
