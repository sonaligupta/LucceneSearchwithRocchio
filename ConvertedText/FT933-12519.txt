FT  23 JUL 93 / UK Company News: First Technology keeps up recovery momentum


   By ANDREW BOLGER


FIRST TECHNOLOGY, which supplies crash dummies and safety sensors to the car
industry, continued its rehabilitation by reporting a sharp increase in
profits and returning to the dividend list.
Mr Fred Westlake, executive chairman, said he would have liked to have paid
more than the 'stingy' 1p dividend announced, but had been constrained by
the terms of the capital reorganisation which was approved in February.
Pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 2.34m in the year to April 30, compared with
Pounds 639,000. However, under FRS 3, last year's figure becomes a loss of
Pounds 685,000 because of the inclusion of an extraordinary charge of Pounds
1.32m on the closure and disposal of businesses.
Group sales fell from Pounds 27.8m to Pounds 25.9m, although turnover from
continuing businesses increased by 22 per cent. Net borrowings fell from
Pounds 6m to Pounds 3.2m and gearing now stands at 51 per cent.
Having got out of vehicle design, Mr Westlake said he was happy to focus on
dummies and car sensors, which had strong growth prospects over the next
couple of years.
The automotive electronics division, which supplies sensors, increased sales
by 32 per cent in spite of difficult trading conditions in the group's
principal North American and European markets.
During the year it won contracts to supply fuel cut-off sensors to Fiat and
Honda.
Earnings per share were 10.75p, compared with 2.4p or a restated loss of
5.83p.
COMMENT
The figures were slightly ahead of expectations and should not impede the
steady recovery in the group's shares, which yesterday closed unchanged at
232p. The collapse in the share price from 500p in 1990 to 20p a mere 18
months later, has left a lot of scars, but the slimmed-down group now seems
both determined and obliged to proceed cautiously. It has strong market
positions, even if increasing legislation does heighten the competitive
threat from other sensor suppliers. Gearing should reduce further, although
the sharp fall last year mainly reflected tax benefits. Forecast profits of
about Pounds 3.7m put the shares on a prospective multiple of 14, a slight
discount to the market. That does not seem expensive, given the group's
confidence about orders, particularly from Japan and other parts of the Far
East, such as Korea.
