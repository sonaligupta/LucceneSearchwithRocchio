FT  04 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets: US soars in the summertime heat


   By JOHN PITT


It is the height of summer, the Olympic Games are in full swing and most
investors' thoughts have wandered to the annual holiday. Yet as Wall Street
heads for record levels it is apparent that there are still some investors
who are delaying their leave. Last week the FT-Actuaries World index put on
2 per cent, its first appreciable gain for nearly a month.
The rally in the US started on Tuesday, when sentiment was boosted by a fall
in long-term bond yields, and also better than expected second quarter
results from Chrysler that lifted car manufacturers in general.
Japan also contributed to the stronger World index. After a disappointing
start to the week when the Nikkei average sank to a new six-year low,
narrowly avoiding a fall below 15,000 on Wednesday, sentiment took a turn
for the better as the government announced that it was bringing forward by a
month its plans to stimulate the economy. By the weekend the index had more
than recouped its losses.
The situation in continental Europe was not so encouraging. Comments by Mr
Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, effectively dashing any hopes
for lower German interest rates this year, held back share prices. The
downgrading of Allianz following its first-ever underwriting losses, and
fears that Deutsche Bank's first-half earnings, due to be published
tomorrow, will fail to meet forecasts also hurt the German market.
However, both Sweden and Switzerland ignored Mr Schlesinger's pessimistic
analysis and showed firm gains on encouraging domestic news.
Astra enjoyed foreign buying on reports of strong US sales, while Skandia
moved ahead as it appeared that a solution was in prospect to Uni
Storebrand's attempt to take control of the Swedish insurer. Switzerland
took comfort from satisfactory results from Union Bank and a strong chemical
sector.
