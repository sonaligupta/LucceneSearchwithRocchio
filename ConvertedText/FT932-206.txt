FT  30 JUN 93 / Inquest on death of Sir Roy Watts


SIR ROY WATTS, chairman of Thames Water, was frail, tired and thinking of
early retirement in the days before his death, an inquest heard yesterday.
Mr Michael Hoffman, group chief executive, told Poplar coroner's court, east
London, that Sir Roy, 67, had told him he was suffering from Parkinson's
disease some months before his body was found in the River Thames in London
on May 4.
At their last meeting, on April 21, Sir Roy had told him he 'might not go
full term'. He had taken that to mean 'that he was going to retire earlier
than we had discussed'. He added that Sir Roy had already said he planned to
leave his Pounds 160,000 a year job before April 1 next year as planned.
Dr Douglas Chambers, coroner, recorded an open verdict. He said no witness
had said Sir Roy had ever suggested taking his life.
