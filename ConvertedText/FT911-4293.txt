FT  19 APR 91 / International Company News: Dow Chemical surprises Wall St


   By KAREN ZAGOR

LOWER costs for hydrocarbon and energy at the beginning of the year helped
Dow Chemical, the second biggest US chemicals group, post
better-than-expected first-quarter earnings. The increase came despite
prices pressure in March.
For the three months to March 31, Dow's underlying earnings per share fell
21.6 per cent, to Dollars 1.34 from Dollars 1.71.
With Wall Street expecting Dow to turn in earnings of about Dollars 1 a
share, the share price increased Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 51 5/8 at the close
on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday.
The company's results were distorted by a Dollars 213m, or 79cents a share,
gain from the initial public offering of Dow's Destec Energy business, and
Dow's net income for the quarter rose 25 per cent to Dollars 576m, or
Dollars 2.13.
Sales were slightly higher at Dollars 4.95bn, against Dollars 4.9bn.
Operating income, however, fell 12.5 per cent to Dollars 785m from Dollars
897m.
Analysts warned that Dow's prospects for the second quarter remain bleak. Mr
John Garcia, at Wertheim Schroder, expected Dow to post 90 cents a share in
the next quarter, reflecting weakness in Europe and the price squeeze that
started to be felt in March.
Prices of polyethylene started sliding in March and are expected to fall
further in the second quarter, with relatively stable demand. Lower ethylene
costs partly offset the decline in the first quarter.
Mr Frank Popoff, chief executive, said: 'While many of our large-volume,
hydrocarbon-based products were under price pressure by mid-February, the
financial impact wasn't felt until March, which allowed margins to expand
modestly early in the first quarter.'
Although hydrocarbon and energy costs were up 12 per cent on last year's,
they were 18 per cent below levels in the final quarter of 1990.
Mr Popoff said hydrocarbon feedstocks were expected to stabilise by the end
of the second quarter. The higher feedstock costs during the Gulf war pushed
up prices by 7 per cent, compared with 1990. Volume in the quarter fell 6
per cent, while manufacturing costs increased 9 per cent.
'The challenge of maintaining margins in an environment of soft economies
and weak industrial fundamentals typifies the current year,' he said.
Looking ahead, Dow expects modestly improved results in 1992, provided the
US economy picks up.
