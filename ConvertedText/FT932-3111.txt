FT  16 JUN 93 / Cuba may pay US over nationalisation


   By AGENCIES


   HAVANA, MEXICO CITY


A SENIOR Cuban official yesterday signalled his government's willingness to
discuss reparations for US properties nationalised by the communist
Caribbean country in the 1960s, agencies report from Havana and Mexico City.
Mr Ernesto Melendez, chairman of the committee on economic co-operation,
said in an interview with the Cuban magazine Contactos that such discussions
could occur as part of negotiations over normalising US-Cuban relations.
He said Cuba had 'never refused to include the theme of mutual claims in the
agenda of eventual negotiations'.
The US State Department has said 5,911 Americans lost Dollars 1.8bn by the
nationalisations, and it reckons the total to have grown, with inflation and
interest, to Dollars 5bn-Dollars 6bn.
At a ceremony near Havana yesterday, Cuba bade farewell to the last members
of an ex-Soviet motorised infantry brigade being withdrawn under a bilateral
accord.
