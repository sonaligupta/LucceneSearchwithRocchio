The City gives its backing - Success for a VR software developer


   By PHILIP MANCHESTER


The business opportunities that virtual reality software technology can
offer were underlined recently by the public flotation of the UK company,
Virtuality Group.
It came to the London Stock Exchange in October 1993 with a share price of
170p, valuing the company at Pounds 44m and turning its founders into
multi-millionaires, writes Philip Manchester.
Since then, the share price has doubled and Virtuality is seen as a hot
investment.
Started as W Industries in 1987 in the classic computer industry style - in
a garage on the outskirts of Leicester in the UK - Virtuality earned
revenues of about Pounds 5m last year from sales of VR equipment and
software, placing it among the world leaders of the emerging VR industry.
Its customers include Matsushita, MCA Universal Studios and games company
Sega.
Virtuality has also attracted investment funds from IBM and Motorola, and
has ambitious plans in the VR software industry.
Co-founder and managing director Dr Jonathan Waldren is reported as saying
he wants the company to be the Microsoft of VR.
Virtuality's current products are at the high end of the VR market. The
company concentrates on what it calls leisure products - although its
definition includes education applications, as well as advertising and
promotional tools.
Virtuality's primary product is an 'immersive' arcade game machine which
sells for Pounds 25,000 upwards.
Sega plans to install Virtuality games in the 'super-arcades' it is building
world-wide.
