FT  23 JUL 94 / Stoppage hits France flights

Dozens of flights were cancelled and hundreds of passengers stranded at
airports yesterday as air traffic controllers in the Aix-en-Provence region
of southern France began a three-day strike. The stoppage, which comes on
one of the busiest weekends of the year for air travel at the start of the
summer holiday season, involves some 100 controllers at the airports in
Marseilles, Nice, Montpellier and Corsica. The strike was called following a
breakdown in talks over pay and working conditions. Only 100 flights left
Nice out of the usual 250. Some 1,000 passengers were stranded in Corsica
because of cancellations and delays. Flights to and from airports outside
the region were also disrupted because the Aix-en-Provence controllers cover
the busy routes from northern Europe to North Africa, Spain and the Balearic
Islands.
