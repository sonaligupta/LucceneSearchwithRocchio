FT  21 JUL 94 / French arrest Spanish trawler


   By REUTER


   PARIS


The French navy yesterday stopped a Spanish trawler in the gulf of Gascony
on France's southwest coast, and directed it to a military port, in the
latest incident in the 'tuna war' between French and Spanish fishermen.
French inspectors said they found fish in a concealed hold below the size
allowed by European Union rules. Earlier, Spanish fishermen who had captured
a French trawler surrendered the boat to marine authorities after alleging
that it carried oversized drift nets. The boat's fate had fired passions
among fishermen in both France and Spain. France has been pressing since the
start of the week for the return of the boat. Mr Edouard Balladur, French
prime minister, stepped up the diplomatic pressure by calling at yesterday's
cabinet meeting for the 'immediate return' of the vessel and stressing that
his government would press for 'compensation' for its owners.
