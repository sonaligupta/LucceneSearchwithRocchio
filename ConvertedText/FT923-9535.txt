FT  05 AUG 92 / Mortar attack on children's funeral


   By REUTER and Our Foreign Staff


MOURNERS at the funeral of the two children killed by snipers while being
evacuated by bus from Sarajevo fled in terror after two mortar bombs
exploded within 100 metres of the graves in what appeared to be a deliberate
attack, Reuter and our foreign staff report.
The grandmother of one of the children was wounded. Sarajevo's central Lion
Cemetery, where the burial took place, has been in the middle of heavy
fighting, but the proximity of the hits seemed to indicate the shelling was
intentional.
'My daughter is dead, and now they've injured my mother,' said Mrs Svetlana
Glavas, mother of one of the children, after her mother Ruza was wounded in
the arm by debris.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, leader of Bosnia's Serbs, accused Moslems of 'staging'
a mortar attack on the funeral of the two children, who were killed during
the evacuation of an orphanage at the weekend.
Elsewhere in the capital, shelling was reported in the Old Town and suburbs
in the west of the city.
Water supplies broke down again because of the fighting. Heavy artillery
could also be heard in the north-west of the city, where Bosnian territorial
forces are trying to break the grip of besieging Serbs. Four people were
killed and 20 wounded, the city's radio reported yesterday.
Meanwhile 30 young orphans, pictured left, reached Germany yesterday, after
an an Aeroflot AN-26 aircraft brought them to a Russian army air strip about
90km south-west of Berlin.
Two of the children were ill with dehydration and exhaustion and were taken
to hospital in Zerbst. The rest were taken to orphanages.
