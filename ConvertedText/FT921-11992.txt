FT  29 JAN 92 / International Company News: Bond Corp confirms deal on
university


   By BRUCE JACQUES


BOND Corporation, the troubled Australian conglomerate once run by Mr Alan
Bond, has confirmed the scheduled sale of its half-share in Australia's
first private university - Bond University - to EIE International, an
offshoot of the Japanese property conglomerate.
The sale was mooted last year as part of a scheme of arrangement with one of
Bond Corp's main creditors, Australian Consolidated Investments.
A statement by Bond Corp to Australian stock exchanges indicated that EIE,
which already controlled half the university, had paid ADollars 55m for the
second half. This equated to book value, but was well below the ADollars
300m development cost of the university.
Late last year, the university cut staff by 40 per cent, citing
uncertainties over continued funding from EIE.
