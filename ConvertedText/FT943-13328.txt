FT  20 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Falsely perceived, but feeling and
looking better


   From Ms SYLVIA HOENIG


Sir, Three cheers for Michael Prowse ('Why vegetarians will inherit the
earth', July 11). Why do vegetarians, non-smokers and non-drinkers face such
flak when they decide to 'come out'?
Probably because they are falsely perceived as wanting to occupy the high
moral ground. They aren't and are just scapegoats for people who would like
to cut out or cut down.
Ian Lamont's letter (July 13) firmly puts him in this bracket. Invoking
Hitler is patronising, petty and scarcely amusing.
It is estimated that 10 per cent of the UK population are vegetarian. I see
little sign of hair shirts or even sandals and beards among them. As a
non-smoker (promised a car for my 21st birthday if I didn't), a non-drinker
(dislike the taste but at 47 no longer mind when teased) and a vegetarian
for six years (self-preservation: no extra meals required when children
became ethical vegetarians), I have never felt or looked better. It is also
increasingly difficult (and irresponsible?) to ignore medical, ethical and
environmental factors. How do others manage?
