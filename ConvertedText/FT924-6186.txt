FT  23 NOV 92 / People: Change of gear at Fiat in UK


Enter James Blades on December 1 as the next managing director of Fiat Auto
(UK) - and with him a new management approach by the Italian industrial
giant to its single most problematical car market in Europe.
Blades, 44, comes from senior sales and marketing positions within Rover
Group. He is also a dyed-in-the-wool Brit. Both factors, in Fiat's eyes,
make him an ideal candidate to succeed current md Mario Massara, who will
return to Turin HQ at the end of the month.
Massara, effectively, represents the last gasp of Fiat's long-standing
'touring' Italian management approach to the perversities of the UK market,
where Fiat has seen its market share dwindle from around 5 per cent in its
late-1970s heydays to 2 per cent this year.
Fiat has never quite been able to understand why its market appeal has been
fading in recent years. So it is now working on the basis that the British
market is perhaps best understood by a British md, backed by other
directors, also overwhelmingly British.
Blades, (left), who left Ford to join Rover back in 1976 when it was still
British Leyland, is seen as a particularly appropriate appointment. This is
because he has been an integral part of Rover's own transition in image from
automotive lame duck to relatively 'prestige' marque. Fiat will be more than
happy if Blades can lead a similar image transformation at
Slough-headquartered Fiat Auto.
His appointment, however, also needs to be seen in a wider context. Fiat,
Italy's largest industrial group, has increasingly grown into a global
operation. Even if it wanted an Italian at the head of each national
activity, there is no longer enough Turin management to go around.
