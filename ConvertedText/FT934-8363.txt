FT  16 NOV 93 / Observer: Family business


It's not often that a City gent gets to be in a world premiere as opposed to
at one. However, tonight sees the debut of Chris Chapman, managing director
of discount house Seccombe, Marshall & Campion, in a new musical about Jane
Eyre which is being presented at The Royal Naval School, Haslemere. Chapman
plays the wicked parson, Mr Brocklehurst, in a cast which includes his wife
and two daughters. Kitting him out has not been a problem. Not only is
Chapman's father a Suffolk clergyman but Chapman also gets a chance to wear
his City top hat - the hallmark of a billbroker - without feeling silly, for
a change.
