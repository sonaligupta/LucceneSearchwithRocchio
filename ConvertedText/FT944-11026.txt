FT  08 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Executives not deterred by flotation
failures this year


   By PETER PEARSE


In spite of the well-publicised failure of 1994 flotations such as
Aerostructures Hamble and McDonnell Information Systems, some 96 per cent of
key executives in other companies recently floated say that, given the
opportunity, they would repeat the exercise.
However, the same MORI survey - commissioned by Eversheds, the law firm -
revealed that feelings on the value of the different advisers varied widely.
Only 56 per cent rated their merchant banks as 'good' or 'very good' value
for money. This compared with 72 per cent for their accountants and 81 per
cent for their lawyers.
In terms of service, 75 per cent were 'satisfied' or 'very satisfied' with
their merchant banks, 88 per cent with their accountants and 93 per cent
with their lawyers.
The survey found that in 51 per cent of cases the total costs of flotation
exceeded expectations, though companies which agreed fixed fees with their
advisers in advance fared better. In 81 per cent of cases where costs did
not exceed expectations, this was because they had been fixed in advance.
Over the 18 months of the survey's span, 94 per cent of flotations have
proved a 'commercial success', in that they realised 'at least as much
capital as anticipated by the company in question'.
Of the 140-odd companies floated between February 1992 and March 1994, 82
managing directors, chief executives, finance directors and comp-any
secretaries were interviewed.
