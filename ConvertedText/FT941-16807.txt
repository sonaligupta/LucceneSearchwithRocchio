FT  07 JAN 94 / International Company News: Japanese buy into Chinese
breweries

Asahi Breweries and Itochu, the Japanese trading house, are to take stakes
in three eastern Chinese breweries. Their plan is to tap the country's
rapidly expanding beer market.
The two companies will pay an estimated Dollars 35m for a combined 75 per
cent share in CSI Brewery, established by the Hong Kong-based China
Strategic Investment Limited.
CSI Brewery has a 55 per cent stake in Hangzhou Zhongce Beer, a 60 per cent
stake in Quanzhou CSI Beer, and a 55 per cent stake in Jiaxing, a brewery
linked to Hangzhou Zhongce.
Asahi intends to transfer technology to the three Chinese companies to
develop their homegrown brands. It also wants to produce its best-known
Japanese beer, Super Dry, in China, believing economic growth will stimulate
demand for quality brews.
The two Japanese companies said that although China was the third-largest
beer market, per capita annual consumption was only seven litres, compared
with 53 litres in Japan. They thought the eastern Chinese market appeared to
be the most lucrative.
However, Suntory, another Japanese brewer, was attracted by similar
statistics in 1984, when it began a joint venture in the eastern port city
of Lianyungang.
After a decade of fine-tuning and management changes at the Chinese partner,
Suntory has began to profit from the venture. Sales, however, are
concentrated in the area around the brewery.
