Roche, the Swiss pharma-ceuticals group, has again fulfilled its investors'
high expectations by reporting a 29 per cent rise in 1993 consolidated net
income to SFr2.48bn (Dollars 1.7bn).
The directors have proposed a 30 per cent rise in the dividends to SFr48 per
share and participation certificate.
The group had earlier reported an 11 per cent rise in 1993 sales to
SFr14.3bn, with all divisions contributing to the increase.
Roche said its operating income had considerably increased, due to greater
use of production capacity and cost management.
Exact figures will be published with the annual report on May 10, but the
group indicated that its operating margins had improved.
