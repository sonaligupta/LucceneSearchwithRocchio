FT  28 JUL 92 / World Trade News: FT and Izvestia in joint business
publishing deal


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


THE Financial Times and Izvestia, the leading quality daily in what was the
Soviet Union, yesterday announced a joint business publishing venture,
Raymond Snoddy reports. Starting in October, the 300,000 Izvestia
subscribers in the Moscow area will receive a weekly eight-page
Russian-language business supplement. It will be printed on pink paper and
be called Financial Izvestia.
The longer term aim is to turn the supplement into a jointly owned
stand-alone weekly publication devoted to the economies of the former Soviet
Union. If the project is a success, there would also be the eventual
possibility of a daily business paper.
Mr David Palmer, chief executive of the Financial Times, said yesterday:
'The FT-Izvestia project is most exciting. The market for Russian-language
and financial news is largely untapped.' Mr Igor Golembiovsky, Izvestia's
editor-in-chief, said that for advertisers the venture would represent 'a
unique opportunity to reach decision makers in the most exciting developing
market in the world'.
Advertisers will be offered an introductory rate of Dollars 10,000 a page.
The venture is a high risk one. Earlier this month, there was an
unsuccessful attempt to re-nationalise Izvestia. The new supplement will
draw on the resources of both papers to provide readers with coverage of
both Russian and international business and economic affairs. For some years
the FT has been interested in exploiting the content of the paper through
joint ventures in other countries and languages.
