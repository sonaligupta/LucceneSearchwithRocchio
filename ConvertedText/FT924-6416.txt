FT  21 NOV 92 / East Timor rebel leader captured


   By REUTER


   JAKARTA


Indonesian troops captured the leader of East Timor's rebel Fretilin
movement yesterday, the army said, Reuter reports from Jakarta.
The rebel chief, a shadowy figure, has long been regarded as a symbol of the
resistance to Indonesian rule imposed on East Timor in 1976, a year after
the departure of East Timor's Portuguese colonial rulers.
