plans deepen

UK GOVERNMENT bonds continued to slide in the wake of the Budget, as the
market showed concern over the government's forecast borrowing requirement
for the next financial year.
With a forecast Public Sector Borrowing Requirement of Pounds 28bn for
1992-93, the gilt market expects to see gross issuance of about Pounds 33bn,
or Pounds 2.75bn a month. Gilts lost between  3/8 and  3/4 of a percentage
point, continuing Tuesday's sharp fall in prices. Traders said the fall in
the US bond market also helped to depress gilts.
The Liffe gilt futures market fell from 95.21 at its opening to close at
95.13 on a volume of about 50,000 contracts, more than double the average
level. The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 dropped from the
overnight level of 114 1/4 to end yesterday at 113 15/32 . Short-dated
issues fell by  3/8 of a percentage point.
Following yesterday's announcement of a general election on April 9, traders
said the market was expected to focus even more keenly on the opinion polls,
looking to see what effect the Budget has had on the Conservative Party's
popularity.
US TREASURY bond prices slipped slightly on the back of continued
profit-taking ahead of today's release of the February sales report.
In late trading, the bellwether 30-year bond was off  19/32 in light trading
at 100 1/2 , yielding 7.95 per cent. The two-year note firmed 1/16 to yield
5.5 per cent.
In addition to fears of strong February sales data, the long end was further
depressed by comments by President George Bush indicating that economic
growth was of more pressing concern to the government than the level of
long-term interest rates. Furthermore, players are becoming worried that an
impending federal tax package will prove inflationary.
The Federal Reserve entered the market to arrange overnight matched sales
when Fed Funds, the rate at which banks lend to each other, were trading at
3 13/16 per cent. The operation, which drains liquidity from the banking
system, was widely expected, with Fed Funds trading below the Fed's
perceived target of 4 per cent.
THE combination of a weaker US Treasury bond market and concerns over German
wage inflation depressed German government bond prices.
Volumes in the Liffe bund futures were below average at about 34,000
contracts. The bund futures contract fell from its opening of 88.44 to close
at 88.30.
Traders said news that Germany's white-collar union workers may step up
their strike action did not help the market. In addition, bunds have been
held in check by the poor inflation figures released recently. The west
German annual inflation rate rose to 4.3 per cent in February from 4 per
cent in January.
JAPANESE government bonds ended mixed, with the futures market outperforming
the cash market, traders said.
The yen weakened against the US dollar, from Y132.5 on Tuesday to Y133.70 in
Tokyo yesterday, in spite of intervention by the Bank of Japan which sold
dollars for yen. The weakening prompted some selling of cash bonds, and the
benchmark No 129 issue ended at a yield of 5.435 per cent, against 5.410 per
cent at Tuesday's close.
However, traders added that hopes of a cut in the Official Discount Rate
appeared to spur buying of Japanese bond futures. The futures contract
opened at 102.30 and reached 102.42 before closing at 102.35. Interest rates
on three-month certificates of deposit fell back from 5.00 per cent to as
low as 4.93 per cent on rate-cut speculation.
