FT  20 JUL 94 / International Capital Markets: Manweb buys back Pounds 37m
more of debt


   By ANTONIA SHARPE


Manweb, the Cheshire-based electricity distributor and supplier, said
yesterday it had bought back a second tranche of its issued debt due 2008
with a face value of Pounds 37m from the UK Treasury.
However, unlike the debt due 1999 with a face value of Pounds 20m which
Manweb bought back on Monday during the Treasury's sale of debt issued by
privatised utilities, it had to buy the second tranche of debt via SG
Warburg Securities, which the Treasury appointed on Monday to sell the
Manweb 2008 bonds.
The fact that Manweb had been the only company which failed to buy back all
of its debt during Monday's auction prompted rumours in the market that
either Manweb had been badly advised on what it should bid or that it had
believed the debt could be bought later at a lower price.
However, Mr Dennis Hughes, Manweb's treasury manager, said he had been
concerned about overpaying for the 2008 bonds on Monday due to 'alarming
rumours' that he had heard about the level of bids in the market for this
tranche.
Therefore, the company put in a 'reasonable, competitive bid' which was not
successful so it proceeded to buy back the debt yesterday through Warburg.
'I am sure that we would have had to bid far more yesterday (Monday) to be
sure of getting back the bonds than what we bid today,' said Mr Hughes.
Bankers involved in the auction believe that Manweb ended up paying an
additional five basis points to buy back the debt through Warburg.
Manweb said the debt buy-back would result in a charge of Pounds 10.8m to
its 1994 - 95 profits but that the earnings enhancement in future years to
be derived from reduced interest costs would more than compensate for this.
