FT  29 JAN 92 / Letter (2): SIB findings on life assurance policy
terminations challenged - and 'polarisation' defended


   From M D ROSS


Sir, In recent articles, sweeping generalisations have been made about the
life assurance industry which require challenge. First, among the leading
life offices such as Scottish Widows lapse rates are at nothing like the
levels referred to. Some 60 to 70 per cent of our policyholders stay over a
20-year period. They get remarkable value for money as do many who for
varying reasons cancel their policies early.
Much is made of the high front-end selling costs of life products. The
leading life companies over the years have helped create considerable
investment in UK industry through saving via life and pensions products. It
is quite absurd to criticise life offices for successfully achieving that
while complaining about lack of sales of other products whose manufacturers
have not devoted sufficient resource and money to their promotion.
Over recent years the tax system has changed, away from favouring regular
long-term savings through pooled investment vehicles; it is time to redress
the balance. It is not disputed that the life industry charges for its
services. What we do argue is that cost comparisons must be fairly based. We
see nothing about disclosure of charges under other savings vehicles such as
banks and building society accounts. What charges are hidden away? How do
real rates of return compare with those provided by life products and unit
trusts?
Little has been said about that because of a seemingly blinkered
concentration on life office charges and nothing else. This cannot be right
and what we seek is not only fair comparison but also balanced debate.
