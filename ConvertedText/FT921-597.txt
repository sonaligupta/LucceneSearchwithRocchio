FT  28 MAR 92 / Letter: Forecasting growth in engineering


   From Mr IAN THOMPSON


Sir, Charles Leadbeater's analysis ('Productivity static in engineering
sector', March 26) of the Engineering Employers' Federation's latest
forecasts concludes that 'this downturn is less likely to bring the industry
long-term gains' in productivity. He points out that engineering
productivity increased by 11 per cent between 1979 and 1982, despite a steep
reduction in output.
However, the productivity gain in 1979-82 was achieved through a reduction
of employment in the industry of more than 700,000. Employment reduction on
that scale could not be repeated. It is two and a half times as many as the
reduction in 1989-92.
The best conditions for improving productivity are of course not during
recession but when output is rising. The EEF's forecasts to mid-1993
indicate an increase of some 5 per cent in output and 8 per cent in
productivity in the next 15 months.
Continuing growth of engineering output and productivity beyond mid-1993
will be crucial not only for the industry itself but for the whole UK
economy.
