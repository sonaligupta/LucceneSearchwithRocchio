FT  23 JUL 93 / Observer: Crash barrier


In accordance with what might be termed Vorsprung Murk Technik, the Germans
are customarily kept in the dark about road accidents in their country. But
the bonnet has now been lifted by a certain Professor Klaus Engels of
Cologne with a study of 102,683 shunts during 1991, which was published in
Focus magazine, a new German weekly.
Alas his work - showing that the toll included 10,643 deaths, 515,960
injuries, and DM17.2bn in insurance pay-outs - is not uniformly considered
useful by the motor manufacturers, at least. Take for instance the sceptical
response Focus quotes from Volkswagen spokesman Dietmar Fritsche: 'What
would the public do with the data?' he asked.
Only adding to VW's woes this summer, it emerges that while the German
company does head at least one of the safety leagues compiled for the US -
where its advertising features road accident statistics alongside a family
with the slogan 'Keep your valuables in a safe place' - none of its models
appears in Engels's top 10 in its home market. They are led by two Nissans
followed by a Peugeot, a Volvo, a Ford Granada, two Mercedes, a Citroen, a
BMW, and a Mercedes again. The best ranked VW, its Santana, comes 13th.
