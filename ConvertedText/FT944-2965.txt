FT  15 DEC 94 / Russians close to taking Grozny


The Russian army was poised to take the Chechen capital of Grozny last night
after peace talks broke down and heavy fighting flared on the outskirts of
the city.
Russian tanks, drawn up on a ridge overlooking the city, pounded Chechen
forces to the north of the capital as aircraft fired rockets into the
suburbs.
The three Russian army divisions which invaded Chechyna on Sunday are now to
the north, east and west of Grozny and many Chechens now expect a full-scale
assault. Russian President Boris Yeltsin's deadline for the surrender of the
Chechen leadership expires today.
Early yesterday, Chechen leader Dzhokhar Dudayev warned on television of a
'life or death war' in which his citizens would have to defend their
country. His statement came as Chechen delegates walked out of peace talks
with Russian officials in the town of Vladikavkaz in neighbouring North
Ossetia.
In three days of clashes, 70 Russian soldiers and 50 Chechen civilians are
reported to have been killed.
