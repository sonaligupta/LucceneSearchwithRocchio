FT  30 NOV 94 / International Company News: Ranger Oil sells North Sea block
stake

   TORONTO


Calgary-based Ranger Oil has agreed to sell its 10 per cent stake in an
undeveloped block in the central North Sea to Shell UK and Esso Exploration
for about USDollars 42.5m, writes Bernard Simon in Toronto.
The block, known as 29/5b, contains the Franklin gas and condensates field
and part of the Elgin field due east of Aberdeen, Scotland.
Mr Fred Dyment, Ranger's chief executive, said the company was concentrating
on projects which could be developed within the next five years with 'an
attractive balance of risk and reward'.
Proceeds will be reinvested in Ranger's exploration and development
programmes, which are centred on western Canada, the Gulf of Mexico and the
North Sea.
However, changes in UK tax laws and the decline in world oil prices have
made North Sea projects less attractive in the past 18 months.
