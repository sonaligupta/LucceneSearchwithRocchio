FT  20 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Disk-drive makers choose Ireland for new
factory

TWO of the world's top disk-drive makers, Matsushita-Kotobuki (MKE) of Japan
and Quantum Corporation of the US, are to open a factory in Ireland as their
base for the European market.
The two have a partnership under which MKE makes a range of 40MB to 240MB
hard disk drives (HDDs) in Japan, while Quantum designs and markets them to
personal computer manufacturers. European sales now top IPounds 250m (Pounds
227m) a year, and represent 35 per cent of Quantum's world market, Quantum
said.
European-based customers include Apple, Hewlett Packard, Unisys, Intel,
Brother and Sun Microsystems. The market is growing 'by 25 per cent a year',
according to Qauntum. The hard-disk device usually accounts for 15 per cent
of the cost of an average PC.
The Industrial Development Authority (IDA) will part fund the new IPounds
21m facility, which is expected to be on stream by autumn. HDDs for the
European market will be assembled in Ireland rather than Japan from
components sourced in the Far East. Ireland was chosen because of grant and
tax incentives, the skilled labour, and for the possibility of sourcing
components from within Ireland as its electronics industry grew, the company
said.
