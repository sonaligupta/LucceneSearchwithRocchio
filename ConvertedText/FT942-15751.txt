FT  14 APR 94 / Alaska hit hard by Teamsters' strike

   ANCHORAGE


Supermarkets in Alaska are struggling to keep the shelves stocked after a
nationwide trucking strike by the Teamsters' union cut off the flow of
merchandise by ship from the west coast, AP reports from Anchorage.
The week-old strike had forced Safeway Stores to pay almost twice as much to
move merchandise by truck and air as it would by sea, Mr Richard Near,
Alaska district manager, said on Tuesday.
Safeway filled 37 trucks with goods in Seattle last Thursday and put them on
the rugged, two-lane Alaska Highway to Anchorage.
Teamsters in Alaska are not part of the strike by about 70,000 drivers, dock
workers and mechanics. But longshoremen have been honouring the union's
picket lines at three west coast ports used by Alaska shippers, including
Tacoma, Washington, the main port.
The Teamsters went on strike against 22 trucking companies on April 6 over a
push to use more part-time workers and more trains. Since then two trucking
companies have reached interim agreements, and a third has gone out of
business.
It is the Teamsters' first nationwide strike against the trucking industry
since 1979.
Governor Walter Hickel and Senator Frank Murkowski of Alaska asked the union
to let Sea-Land Freight Service, the big ocean freight link between Alaska
and the rest of the United States, load ships.
'We're stressing how dependent the state economy is on ocean transport,'
said Mr Jim McKenna, Alaska general manager for Sea-Land. 'There really is
no other realistic way to ship goods up here.'
But Mr Ron Carey, the Teamsters' president, suggested the politicians
contact the trucking companies involved in the dispute.
'We take no pleasure in a strike that causes economic disruption for other
businesses and the average citizen,' Mr Carey said.
'But this is a fight for the long-term interests of all working Americans.'
