FT  15 DEC 94 / Tax evaders may end up in prison

Guatemalan tax evaders may end up in prison for not paying their taxes after
Congress passed reforms to the penal code which will criminalise tax evasion
for the first time.
The reforms which come into effect on February 1, allow for substantial
fines and prison sentences of up to six years for tax evaders and for
corrupt officials who accept pay-offs.
It also gives the government the right to close businesses temporarily.
The reforms will provide the coercive means to improve tax collection
following the approval at the end of November by congress of a number of tax
reforms intended to increase the tax burden from 7 per cent of GDP this year
to 8.5 per cent in 1995.
Despite pressure from the private sector, the right-wing parties which
dominate Congress approved an increase for the top bracket of income tax
from 25 per cent to 30 per cent, imposed a 1.5 per cent tax on company
assets and agreed to increase sales tax from 7 per cent to 10 per cent by
January 1996.
