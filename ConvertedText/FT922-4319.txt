FT  05 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: NZ fish industries enjoy a
bumper year - Higher exports and a weaker currency have helped to boost
profits


   By TERRY HALL


NEW ZEALAND achieved a bumper harvest from its fishing and fish processing
industries last year, as well as from the farming of mussels, salmon,
oysters and scallops. The Fishing Industry Board says that total catch was
worth Dollars NZ1.1bn (Pounds 325m) in the year to December 31, while export
returns rose by 28.4 per cent to a record NZDollars 961.2m.
Mr Ray Dobson, the board's chief executive says the export sector is
continuing to perform strongly and will be a NZDollars 2bn-a-year industry
by the year 2000.
A number of factors came together to enable the industry to achieve a sharp
improvement from 1990, when it encountered difficulties because of low
international fish prices and a very high New Zealand exchange rate.
The industry's export competitive index shows that as the exchange rate fell
export prices rose. This coincided with a period of white fish shortages in
world markets, increasing prices. Input prices also dropped. In its annual
review, released May 28, the board says that the exchange rate will continue
to have a dominant effect on the industry, but the medium term outlook is
for the present favourable conditions to continue as the currency remains
low, world demand strong and domestic inflation low.
A sharp rise in the value of hoki, a deep sea white-fleshed fish, played a
key role in the bumper year, becoming the industry's top earner for the
first time with earnings up 126 per cent to NZDollars 156m. Exports rose to
49,202 tonnes from 33,961 tonnes in 1990 and returns per tonne were up 56
per cent to NZDollars 3,176. The board says the rise was in part due to
further processing in New Zealand.
While the volume of whole frozen hoki exported fell 35 per cent, the value
of frozen fillets sent overseas was up 50 per cent. Nearly 60 per cent of
the hoki went to the US, one of the highest paying markets. The board says
that the rising demand there is due to promotional work and the shortage of
cod, America's favourite white fish.
Orange fell to second place in exports. The volume was down 14 per cent to
14,349 tonnes, although this was worth only 4 per cent less at NZDollars
138.6m as the average export price rose from NZDollars 8,671 to NZDollars
9,657 a tonne. Most was shipped to the US. The board says the outlook is
promising as demand from the restaurant trade is expected to lift as the
American economy comes out of recession.
Total exports of rock lobster, or crayfish, rose substantially. While the
total volume rose only 5 per cent, Receipts were up 22 per cent to NZDollars
101.8m, and average returns rose from NZDollars 30,403 a tonne in 1990 to
NZDollars 35,941. Japan remained the largest market for rock lobster, taking
60 per cent by value. Much of this was sent live. The US bought substantial
quantities of frozen tails.
Concern has been growing about overfishing of rock lobsters. It is estimated
that illegal catches account for an extra 27 per cent above the officially
authorised quantities that can be taken.
Mr Dobson believes, however, that the new management plan worked out between
the government and the industry last year will promote a stock recovery that
will allow the rock lobster industry to enhance its position as a major
export earner. This plan agreed with recreational fishing interests and
Maori and conservation groups, has set new rules on the size of females that
may be caught, and on the netting size of pots to permit undersized
specimens to escape.
Snapper exports had a disappointing year, with both volume and value
remaining more or less static. Export volume was 6,604 tonnes, down slightly
from 6,729 tonnes in 1990, and exports were worth NZDollars 51.5m, compared
with NZDollars 49.4m. Most went to Japan, which took growing quantities of
live fish. Australia was another important market.
Squid exports fell sharply to 25,507 tonnes, compared with 33,981 tonnes in
1990, which was itself a very low figure. However the value rose slightly
from NZDollars 1,877 to NZDollars 1,821 a tonne. Mr Dobson says, however,
that the outlook for squid fishermen is brightening. Catches are expected to
rise in response to a new management plan and a 'cyclic' change in returns
is expected over the next two years.
Fish farming continued to thrive. Total export earnings rose 27 per cent
last year to NZDollars 69.3m, 7.2 per cent of the total for all seafood
exports. Volume rose to 13,813 tonnes. There was a dramatic increase in
exports of Greenshell mussels, the internationally copyrighted name carried
by the New Zealand product.
Overseas sales rose last year to 10,654 tonnes, worth NZDollars 42.1m, a 23
per cent rise on 1990. The review said that this growth showed the potential
that existed and could also be applied to a wide range of other species,
including products such as scallops, farmed lobsters, paua, prawns, snapper,
shrimp and crabs. Extensive research is being undertaken to find ways to
farm these species.
It is estimated that last year 43,600 tonnes of Greenshell mussels were
produced, including about 33,000 tonnes in the Marlborough Sounds and 10,000
tonnes in the Coromandel. That was a 22.5 per cent rise on the 1990 figure,
which in turn was 17 per cent up on 1989.
Last year 2200 tonnes of Pacific oysters were produced, a rise of 10 per
cent. Exports were worth NZDollars 7.4m.
New Zealand exported 2,250 tonnes of salmon last year, earning NZDollars
20m, up from NZDollars 14.1m in 1990. While substantial increases in world
supplies of farmed salmon are expected, New Zealand has secured important
niche markets with top quality products, the board says, and it expects this
to stand it in good stead in the years ahead.
Japan is New Zealand's biggest market for seafood in both volume and value.
Exports last year totalled 77,765 tonnes, worth NZDollars 290m. The US was
second taking 35,619 tonnes, up 22 per cent on 1990, worth NZDollars 253.7m.
Exports to Australia were worth NZDollars 102m, while the Republic of Korea
was in fourth place with purchases worth NZDollars 67.9m, up from NZDollars
35.4m. Other important Asian markets were Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand,
while in Europe Britain and France were substantial customers.
