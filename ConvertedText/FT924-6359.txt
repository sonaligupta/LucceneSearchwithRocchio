FT  21 NOV 92 / International Company News: Competition eats into NTT
earnings


   By CHARLES LEADBEATER


   TOKYO.


THE DOWNTURN in the Japanese economy, combined with intensifying
competition, has forced Nippon Telegraph and Telephone into a 21 per cent
decline in pre-tax profits for the six months to the end of September.
NTT said yesterday its income from dial charges had been slashed to maintain
market share against mounting competition from a range of new entrants into
Japan's liberalised tele-communications market.
Pre-tax profits fell to Y105bn (Dollars 853m) on a 0.5 per cent fall in
sales to Y2,963bn. The company's after-tax profits dropped from Y69bn in the
first half of last year to Y45bn in the first half of this year.
Non-operating income fell by Y6bn to Y32bn. The company was unable to cut
its operating costs, which rose by Y31bn to Y2,751bn.
The turnover of dial telephone services fell by 5.9 per cent to Y1,253bn
partly because NTT had to cut its long distance call charges in response to
cuts by its smaller competitors.
NTT's results were also hurt by the demerger in July of its profitable
mobile telephone company.
Mr Masashi Kojima, NTT's president said the company would respond by cutting
costs and by marketing recently developed network services to domestic
subscribers, such as call forwarding and credit card services.
Mr Kojima said further cuts in NTT's long dist-ance rates were unlikely, but
other charges such as its basic subscription charge would be reviewed in
February.
Turnover of the group's general telephone services fell by Y36bn to
Y2,383bn, largely reflecting lower charges and reduced usage.
Sales of its pocket pager services, widely used by businesses were also
down.
However, other parts of NTT's business, including leased circuits for
private use and directory services, increased their turnover markedly.
