FT  08 NOV 93 / People: David Robins steps up at UBS


Union Bank of Switzerland's announcement that it is splitting the functions
of chairman and chief executive of UBS in the UK with effect from next year
is a clear indication that its London operation has at last come of age.
Rudolf Mueller, who has held both positions since 1989, will remain chairman
of UBS UK and will focus on the overall strategic direction of the group.
David Robins (above left), who becomes chief executive, will be responsible
for the day-to-day running of the London operation.
Mueller's main task since 1987 has been the integration of UBS Securities
and Phillips & Drew, the London stockbroking firm which UBS bought in 1985.
The process has not been without its problems, thanks to the Blue Arrow
affair and the culture clash sparked by the efficiency of the Swiss bank and
the clubby atmosphere prevailing in the City around the time of Big Bang.
However, Mueller appears to have succeeded in getting his 2,000 staff to
pull together. He also has the satisfaction of handing on a profitable
operation to Robins.
At 59, Mueller is close to UBS's retirement age of 62. By contrast, Robins,
who is 44, faces the challenge of taking UBS UK into the next century. One
hopes that his 13 years at UBS in London, Tokyo, New York and Zurich will
stand him in good stead.
