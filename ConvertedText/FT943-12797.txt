FT  22 JUL 94 / International Company News: Charge holds back Colgate
Palmolive


   By RICHARD TOMKINS


Colgate-Palmolive, the US consumer products group, posted net income
virtually unchanged at Dollars 142.5m in the second quarter. The group was
hampered by a fall in profits in North America and a Dollars 5.2m charge for
the sale of a non-core business.
World-wide unit volume grew by 9 per cent, driven by strong increases in
Europe and the developing world. Group sales rose 7 per cent to Dollars
1.9bn, and would have risen by 9 per cent without the adverse effect of
shifts in exchange rates.
However, volume slumped by nearly 9 per cent in North America in spite of
the introduction of new products. Colgate-Palmolive said its goods were
still being bought in the same quantities but the retail trade had sharply
reduced stocks.
Net income in the comparable quarter was Dollars 142.4m.
Colgate-Palmolive said the latest figure would have been 4 per cent ahead
without the special charge.
Fully diluted earnings per share, lifted by aggressive stock repurchases
that reduced issued equity by 8 per cent, rose by 7 per cent to 87 cents
from 81 cents.
Net income in the first half rose to Dollars 292.1m from Dollars 283.2m,
excluding the effect of accounting changes last time.
