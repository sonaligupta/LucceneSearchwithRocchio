FT  04 AUG 92 / Purchasing index shows low growth

   WASHINGTON


THE Purchasing Managers' Index - a closely-watched indicator of the health
of US manufacturing - registered a small rise last month, suggesting factory
output is continuing to grow sluggishly.
The index rose to 54.2 per cent, against 52.8 per cent in June, a bigger
increase than generally expected in financial markets.
However, the index remained below its recent high of 56.3 per cent in May
and far below the levels expected in a normal economic recovery.
The report provides no comfort for the Bush administration, which was hoping
for a significant acceleration of growth in the second half. Also, the
index's resilience argues against a triple-dip recession involving a fresh
decline in output.
Mr Robert Bretz, for the National Association of Purchasing Management, said
the figures pointed to continuing economic growth at the sluggish pace
registered in the second quarter. Gross domestic product grew at an annual
rate of 1.4 per cent in April-June, according to a preliminary Commerce
Department estimate published last week.
