FT  21 APR 94 / Top 150 directors see pay rise 32%


   By SIMON DAVIES


The pay packages of the 150 highest-paid directors of listed companies rose
by an average 32 per cent last year, says the latest Arthur Andersen
corporate register, Simon Davies writes.
The survey, by publishers Hemmington Scott, does not list the corresponding
increase in earnings for the companies employing the directors, but it would
be closer to 20 per cent. It lists an average pay package - excluding
pension contributions - of Pounds 677,280 for the 150 directors, up from
Pounds 505,852.
