FT  04 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Syndicated loans sector
tapped by EC for Ecu499m


   By SARA WEBB


THE EUROPEAN Community is tapping the international syndicated loans market
for the first time in a decade - and at the most tightly priced terms in
recent loans history.
The Ecu499m, three-year loan, which is being arranged by Credit Lyonnais,
carries a margin of 3.125 basis points - or   1/32 of a percentage point
over the London interbank offered rate (Libor). In addition, the
participating banks will receive fees of 10 basis points.
As recently as last week, bankers forecast that the EC would probably have
to pay a margin of between 10 and 20 basis points over Libor. Pricing in
terms of margins and fees has climbed steadily over the last two to three
years, reflecting bankers' concern over the cost of capital. However, as one
German banker pointed out, the EC is a triple A rated borrower which is zero
risk weighted for capital adequacy purposes.
The EC traditionally prefers to borrow in the international bond markets
where it can raise funds at sub-Libor rates. In this case it has had no
choice but to tap the syndicated loans sector and risk paying a higher
interest rate. That is because the proceeds of the loan will be used to
finance imports of agricultural and medical products by the former Soviet
republics.' It was necessary to have the flexibility to accommodate the way
the funds are going to be used,' said Mr Antoine Albert Bloch, the EC head
of borrowing, yesterday.
In contrast to a bond where all the proceeds are paid at once, with a loan
the borrower can draw the proceeds as and when they are required.
Bankers yesterday described the loans pricing as 'tight'.
The facility is due to be signed on August 14 and may be drawn with effect
from August 20.
The EC last tapped the international syndicated loans market in 1983 with a
Dollars 1.24bn term loan.
