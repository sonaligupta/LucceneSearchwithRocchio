FT  23 JUL 93 / Supermarkets in Sunday protest


BRITAIN'S three biggest supermarkets have joined forces to fight off the
latest threat to Sunday trading.
J. Sainsbury, Safeway and Tesco will cover up to half their goods with
plastic sheeting at their stores in Solihull, West Midlands, but will remain
open for the combined total of 14,500 people who regularly use the three
branches on Sunday.
They agreed to sell only goods which do not breach the Shops Act after
Solihull Council threatened to seek a High Court injunction to close them
down on Sundays.
