FT  28 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: British Gas


Relations between British Gas and its regulator have been strained for a
while now, so the market has grown used to their robust exchanges of views.
Hence in part its calm response to what appeared an intemperate outburst
from Ofgas in response to Thursday's news that Gas intends merely to freeze,
rather than cut, prices for domestic consumers.
Equally, this close to the election shares in utilities are bound to react
more to the polls than to evidence that the regulator may be back on the
warpath. Gas has already suffered more from regulatory intervention than any
of its peers, so it is in relatively little danger from political change.
On a more general level, the price freeze raises the question of how Gas
might fare in a period of sustained low inflation. It seems logical that its
present price formula of 5 percentage points below inflation will become
increasingly punitive as the retail price index falls. Unless it succeeds in
its campaign to re-cast the formula, Gas will presumably have to accelerate
job cuts in order to meet the target. Its shares will continue to yield well
above the market average because Gas will show slower than average dividend
growth. Their present prospective yield of nearly 8 per cent suggests they
are already discounting that conventional thinking.
But Gas has defied such expectations before, and could do so in future
depending on the success of its nascent exploration activity. Even if its
scope for dividend growth is only marginally greater than the market view
assumes, its shares should interest investors brave enough to be looking for
value ahead of the election.
