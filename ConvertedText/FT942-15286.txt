   By JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON


News that satellite broadcaster BSkyB was partly to repay investors after
raising Pounds 500m, helped leading shareholders Pearson, Granada and News
International, the UK arm of 50 per cent shareholder News Corp.
Pearson, which will receive Pounds 81m, saw its shares gain 5 to 645p, while
Granada, which will get Pounds 64m, added 11 at 556p. News International
improved 8 to 278p.
Huge turnover of 6.5m shares surrounded Aegis, the media and communications
group, after a two-way pull on the stock developed. The company reported a
loss of Pounds 18.1m against a loss of Pounds 10.9m the previous year. Some
analysts said that all the bad news was out in the open and the company
poised for recovery. The shares held steady at 23 1/2 pp.
Building materials group Blue Circle Industries continued the run of
excellent results from the sector, announcing preliminary profits above most
analysts' expectations. BCI shares touched 339p before ending 6 higher at
333p. Sector specialists were particularly pleased with the company's
performance in the US and said they expected substantial profits upgrades to
follow the results.
RMC advanced 12 more to 978p, boosted by good results announced on Wednesday
and additionally helped by Bundesbank interest rate cuts. Redland, like RMC
heavily involved in the German market, moved up 8 to 556p. Caradon was a
lone poor performer in the sector, the shares slipping 8 to 347p in the wake
of a big selling order.
Shares in British Steel hit a 5 year high adding 3 3/4 to 152 1/2 p, after
Goldman Sachs issued a buy recommendation. Turnover rose to 18m, to make it
one the most active stocks.
Market watchers attributed some of the day's buying to institutions that had
attended a company presentation on Wednesday hosted by Cazenove.
Vodafone attracted fresh bouts of selling pressure from the US where
investors focused on the potential threat to the established cellular phone
companies from Orange, the new service being launched at the end of the
month by Hutchison. Vodafone shares 8 1/2 to 517 1/2 p after good turnover
of 4.2m.
The Scottish generators were given a rough ride in a generally weak
utilities area as BZW, the investment bank, downgraded the two stocks.
Scottish Hydro fell 19, or 5 per cent, to close at 352p, while Scottish
Power dropped 13, or 3.3 per cent, to 379p.
Textile group Lamont lifted 9 to 433p following a sharp rise in annual
profits to Pounds 11.4m from Pounds 6.4m previously.
Pharmaceuticals group Glaxo fell 6 to 568p as US investment group Morgan
Stanley added its weight to the gloomy views overhanging the company and
reiterated its sell stance. Glaxo options were also the most active with the
equivalent of 2.2m shares traded.
News of an Office of Fair Trading inquiry into the supply of some Japanese
electronic goods to warehouse retailers upset Dixons, with the shares off 5
1/2 at 197 1/2 p. The OFT probe is reported to be looking at the suppliers'
reluctance to provide goods to the discount groups. BZW was said to be among
the sellers.
Allied Lyons jumped 19 to 571p with 7.6m traded, with Smith New Court said
to be positive. Grand Metropolitan, off 7 at 458p, was undermined by news of
the loss of a US contract to a subsidiary of Guinness, up 2 at 171p.
Whitbread put on 5 to 549p.
Engineering group IMI jumped 12 to 355p, with Smith New Court upgrading
profit expectations.
Reg Vardy put on 13 to 209p, after issuing an upbeat trading statement ahead
of today's analyst visit to the group.
