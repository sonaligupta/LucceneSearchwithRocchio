FT  27 SEP 94 / UK Company News: How Group interim losses reduced


How Group, the engineering concern, cut pre-tax losses by 23 per cent to
Pounds 1.12m in the first half of 1994, against Pounds 1.45m last time which
included Pounds 488,000 related to discontinued activities.
Turnover was Pounds 58.4m (Pounds 70.5m), which Mr Peter How, chairman, said
was because of the normal time-lag of converting construction orders into
work-in-progress. A marked increase was evident in work being undertaken and
turnover for the year was expected to be similar to 1993.
Mr How said that 'generally, there is a renewed feeling of optimism, which I
do not believe to be misplaced. . . . Competition, though still fierce, is
becoming a little more realistic as the volume of enquiries rises.'
Losses per share came to 2.69p (2.64p), but the interim dividend is again
0.375p.
