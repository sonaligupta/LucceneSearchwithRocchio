FT  13 NOV 93 / Levitt 'tried to put blame on others'


   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent


MR ROGER LEVITT, former chairman of the collapsed financial services group,
tried to blame others for the fraudulent activities of his company, it was
alleged at the Old Bailey yesterday.
Mr David Cocks QC, prosecuting, said that when first interviewed by police
Mr Levitt told them that everything had been done 'behind his back'. During
these interviews Mr Levitt seemed to be placing blame on everyone's
shoulders except his own.
This was completely untrue, he said, since Mr Levitt was at the heart of the
fraud which involved illegally injecting Pounds 21m into the ailing company.
Mr Levitt and three other former directors, Mr Mark Reed, Mr Alan McNamara
and Mr Robert Price, all deny a charge of fraudulent trading between April
1989 and December 1990.
Mr Cocks said the blatant dishonesty was demonstrated when the thriller
writer Mr Frederick Forsyth in May 1990 agreed to invest Pounds 400,000 in
bonds with the Levitt Group. The money was placed in the Levitt Group's own
accounts, however, rather than clients' accounts.
The trial continues.
