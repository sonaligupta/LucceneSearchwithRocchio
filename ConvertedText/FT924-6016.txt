FT  24 NOV 92 / Close race for Georgia Senate seat


   By BARBARA HARRISON

VOTERS in the state of Georgia today cast ballots in a closely fought
run-off election for a US Senate seat, writes Barbara Harrison in Atlanta.
The incumbent Democratic Senator Wyche Fowler, a liberal with backing from a
coalition of blacks, women and labour, is being challenged by Mr Paul
Coverdell, a conservative Republican, who has the support of the religious
right.
The outcome of the race is important enough to have drawn Mr Bill Clinton to
campaign for Mr Fowler; the president-elect said he needed him in the Senate
to help 'break this gridlock in Washington'. A Fowler victory would give the
Democrats 57 Senate seats, the same number as before the election.
Another by-election next week in North Dakota, where the Democrats are
strongly favoured, would add another seat but their total would still be
short of the 60 needed to cut off Republican filibusters.
The run-off is being held because Georgia law requires a candidate to
receive a majority of the vote; in the November 3 election, Mr Fowler won
just 49 per cent of the ballots, while Mr Coverdell won 48 per cent.
The campaigns have been called the dirtiest in local memory. The
mud-slinging, conducted largely through television advertisements, has
dismayed many voters and is likely to spur few to vote.
