FT  27 JAN 94 / Romanian partnership with Nato


   By REUTER


   BRUSSELS


Romania became the first former Cold War foe of Nato to sign a partnership
document with the military alliance yesterday and said it wanted to become a
full member of the 16-nation body soon, Reuter reports from Brussels.
'My country considers the Partnership for Peace as a preliminary stage to
Romania's future membership of Nato's political and military structures,' Mr
Teodor Melescanu, Romanian foreign minister, told a meeting of Nato
ambassadors.
He signed the Partnership for Peace Framework Document, an initiative agreed
at Nato's summit in Brussels this month.
Mr Amedeo de Franchis, Nato deputy secretary-general said the signing of the
document was a 'starting point', but he declined to give his view on Romania
achieving full membership of the organisation.
Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas, nervous of nationalism in Russia,
is to sign a similar document today.
