First Florida


   By BLOOMBERG


BARNETT Banks, in an effort to bolster its leading market position in
Florida, plans to merge with First Florida Banks in a stock transaction
valued at about Dollars 885m, Bloomberg reports.
In the merger of Florida's two oldest banks, First Florida shareholders will
receive 1.42 Barnett common shares for each First Florida share.
Barnett Banks, the 19th largest bank in the US with Dollars 32.9bn in
assets, operates 550 offices in Florida and 42 offices in neighbouring
Georgia.
First Florida, based in Tampa, has about Dollars 5.4bn in assets and
operates 144 banking offices along Florida's west coast and throughout the
central part of the state.
First Florida recently initiated steps to improve its balance sheet. Last
October, it took a charge of about Dollars 116m to cover loan losses and to
write down bad real estate loans.
