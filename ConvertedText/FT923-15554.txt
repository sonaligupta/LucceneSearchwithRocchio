FT  01 JUL 92 / Lonrho falls 65%and cuts dividend


   By ROLAND RUDD


LONRHO, the international trading conglomerate, yesterday reported a 65 per
cent fall in pre-tax profits for the half year to the end of March and cut
its interim dividend from 5p to 2p per share.
A combination of the continuing effects of the recession and technical
problems at the South African Western Platinum mine saw pre-tax profits
decline from Pounds 109m to Pounds 38m. Earnings per share fell from 9.3p to
0.1p.
Profits before taxation would have been worse without property disposals
accounting for Pounds 12m (Pounds 9m) including Pounds 7m (Pounds 1m)
relating to associates.
Net borrowings fell from Pounds 1.1bn to Pounds 903m. Although asset sales
realised Pounds 500m, borrowings remained high after Pounds 100m of capital
expenditure and the acquisition of majority ownership of Gewog, a German
holding company, which inflated the overall debt figure by Pounds 135m.
The Pounds 500m gained from asset disposals also included Pounds 177.5m from
the sale of a one-third stake in the Metropole Hotel chain to the Libyan
Arab Foreign Investment Company. Part of this sum went towards eliminating
borrowings associated with the Metropole chain.
Mr Paul Spicer, deputy chairman, said: 'You have to admit that to cut
overall debt in a recession without a loss of income is an achievement.'
He added that further disposals would take place over the next six months,
further reducing debt, and predicted a much better second half.
Shareholders' funds, excluding minorities of Pounds 433m, remained unchanged
at Pounds 1.3bn. Lonrho's tax charge as a percentage of pre-tax profits
increased to 63 per cent (20 per cent). Estimated tax was Pounds 24m (Pounds
22m).
Mr Spicer said the cutting of the dividend had mitigated its advance
corporation tax problem - corporation tax payable on the company's UK
profits are not large enough to offset the ACT payable on its dividends.
Net interest payable fell slightly from Pounds 54m to Pounds 52m. A further
Pounds 13m (Pounds 12m) was capitalised during the period. The group has
cash of Pounds 283m (unchanged), 80 per cent of which is deposited with
European banks.
Pre-tax profits fell in all of Lonrho's businesses and geographical areas.
Southern Africa suffered the biggest fall, from Pounds 32m to Pounds 3m, due
to technical problems at Western Platinum and the fall in the price of
precious metals.
