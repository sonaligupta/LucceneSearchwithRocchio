The United Nations is studying new conditions set by the Khmer Rouge for the
guerrilla group to implement Cambodia's peace accords, agencies report from
Phnom Penh. The Khmer Rouge wants the SNC's power increased by the
establishment of consultative committees to work with the UN in supervising
the administration and policing of the four rival factions.
