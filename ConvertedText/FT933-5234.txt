FT  04 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: 'Rationalists' oppose Maastricht


   From Mr PAUL G BYARD


Sir, Many people throughout Europe (and other parts of the world) have
serious reservations about the Maastricht treaty, believing it to be leading
European Community countries in the wrong direction with potentially
disastrous consequences. We are neither Euro-sceptics nor anti-European;
Euro-rationalists is a more accurate description.
