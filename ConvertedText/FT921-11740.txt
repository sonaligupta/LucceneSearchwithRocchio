FT  30 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Danes warn of dairy products
flood


   By HILARY BARNES

THE European Community will be flooded with Danish dairy products if the
Gatt proposals now on the table are implemented, according to the Danish
Dairy Board.
Denmark is the EC's largest exporter of dairy products to third countries.
It accounts for 39 per cent of the EC's export of cheese to non-member
countries.
The Dairy Board calculates that Denmark's cheese exports to third countries
would fall gradually by about 45,000 tonnes from a total export to third
countries of 150,000 tonnes a year.
Denmark also exports about 112,000 tonnes of milk powder, sterile cream and
casein products to third countries, a substantial part of which will be
diverted to Europe if the Gatt proposal is realised.
However, only about 15,000 tonnes of Danish butter go to third countries out
of total exports of 50,000 tonnes. Other EC exporters of dairy products,
such as Holland, France and Ireland, face similar problems. A total of
between 4m and 5m milk equivalent tonnes of dairy products could be diverted
to the European market, causing milk prices to fall by 20-25 per cent,
according to the Danes.
