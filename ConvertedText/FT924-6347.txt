FT  21 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses influenced by Swedish
krona float


   By Our Markets Staff and HILARY BARNES


BOURSES took their cue from the Swedish krona float as renewed currency
tension moved from Scandinavia to the rest of Europe, writes Our Markets
Staff.
STOCKHOLM rose another 8.8 per cent in record turnover of SKr2.7bn, fuelled
by the positive impact of devaluation. According to Goldman Sachs, past
historical experience in Sweden suggested that, on average, a 15 per cent
devaluation increased share prices by 35 per cent to 40 per cent.
The Affarsvarlden General index closed 66.3 higher at 821.1, up 13.9 per
cent on a week during which the krona was effectively devalued by 11 per
cent against the dollar.
Forestry shares were the outstanding winners on their sharp increase in
competitiveness. Modo B put on SKr35 or 30 per cent to SKr150 and Stora
B-frees gained SKr44 to SKr256.
Mr Peter Lawrence at Kleinwort Benson said that investors were buying into
Sweden for its big international blue chips and their sensitivity to reduced
costs and higher export margins.
Among other Nordic markets, OSLO rose 4.1 per cent on speculation that
Norway would also be forced to devalue. The all-share index closed 14.14
higher at 356.27.
HELSINKI retreated from morning highs on the failure of income settlement
talks between the government and trade unions, although the Hex index rose
9.3 to 794.2.
COPENHAGEN, more associated with the hard-currency bloc in mid-Europe, was
affected by rising short-term interest rates, writes Hilary Barnes. The
all-share index fell 3.38 to 265.82, 2.7 per cent lower on the week. Danisco
closed DKr20 down at DKr641 after forecasting lower-than-expected current
year profits as a result of devaluations in Britain and Sweden.
PARIS steadied after its recent fall on hopes of a Gatt trade deal between
the US and Europe. This helped to offset a rise in overnight rates to defend
the franc, which weakened on Sweden's decision to float the krona.
Position-squaring ahead of the close of the account on Monday also supported
share prices. The CAC-40 index added 1.85 to 1,724.18, down 4 per cent on
the week, in turnover of FFr2.4bn.
Euro Disney continued to drop after its annual results, closing FFr2.30 or
3.4 per cent down at FFr65.70. Elf fell FFr8.20 to FFr323 as an analyst at
Kidder Peabody in New York downgraded the oil company from 'buy' to 'hold'
and lowered his 1992 and 1993 earnings estimates. One of the big UK brokers
is about to lower its forecasts for Elf following a visit to the company.
Havas dropped FFr6.2 to FFr419 following news late on Thursday that it owned
3.06 per cent of its media rival, Hachette. Last month Havas denied that it
had any interest in buying shares in Hachette.
MILAN ended lower but a late recovery led by Credito Italiano trimmed
earlier losses. The Comit index fell 5.65 to 459.07, down 0.4 per cent on
the week, in turnover estimated at around Thursday's L263.5bn.
Credito rose L155 or 5.8 per cent to L2,830 on rumours that its shares would
be valued at as much as L5,000 for the forthcoming sale of Iri's 67 per cent
stake in the bank. Banca Commerciale Italiana followed suit, adding L184 to
L4,615.
Sme remained suspended but Consob said that trading in the shares could
resume on Monday, provided that Iri gave a clear indication of its plans for
the state-controlled food group at a board meeting scheduled for today.
FRANKFURT was soured by a cut in the Metallgesellschaft dividend and only
slightly appeased by better-than-expected profits from Hoechst. The DAX
index closed 6.89 lower at 1,544.76, fractionally down on the week in
turnover of DM4.4bn after DM5.5bn.
The metals company fell DM4.80 to DM323 and the chemicals group rose DM1.40
to DM241.90. BASF fell another DM2.30 to DM207.70 after seriously
disappointing figures on Thursday.
Carmakers fell, with VW losing DM2.80 to DM287.50 following its Audi unit's
announcement of plans to cut its workforce.
BRUSSELS rose on hopes that further interest rate cuts were on the way. The
Bel-20 index added 7.62 to 1,142.82, up 0.4 per cent on the week.
Shares in Banque Bruxelles Lambert remained suspended after news that
Internationale Nederlanden Groep was withdrawing its bid for BBL. But the
shares were quoted 12 per cent down at BFr2,900 in the pre-bourse. BBL's
shareholder, Groupe Bruxelles Lambert, fell BFr100 or 3.6 per cent to
BFr2,700.
AMSTERDAM was mixed to easier as the CBS Tendency Index fell 0.3 to 103.4,
down 1.3 per cent on the week. ING jumped Fl 1.60 or 3.3 per cent on news
that it had decided against taking over BBL.
MADRID saw profit-taking and the general index fell 2.73 to 212.75, but it
still came out 5 per cent ahead on the week, lifted by better-than-expected
inflation figures last Friday.
