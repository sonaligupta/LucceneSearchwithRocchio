FT  12 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading


   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE


WITH ALL eyes on the chancellor of the exchequer's Autumn Statement today,
business in the derivatives market was quiet, with a hint of nervousness
over the exact content of the package adding downward pressure, writes
Christopher Price.
The December contract on the FT-SE future opened firmly at 2,745. However,
this proved to be the high point of the day as buyers stayed on the
sidelines and the contract drifted in quiet trading.
Despite an attempt at a lunchtime rally, the slow downward trend continued,
with one overseas bank reported to be a big seller in afternoon trading,
revealing a nervousness in the market that the Autumn Statement would not
produce the dynamic economic package hoped for. In particular, talk that
interest rate cuts would be limited to just  1/2 percentage point was heard.
A late plunge meant December closed at 2,717, a fall of 28 on the previous
session and at a 4-point premium to its fair value of around 17. The trading
range fluctauted between zero and 10 to fair value during the day. Volume
was 5,386 lots.
Traded options were busier, 25,504 contracts being traded of which 6,389
were in the FT-SE 100 option.
Asda was once again the busiest stock option at 3,632, followed by Scottish
Power at 1,723 and Lasmo at 1,697 contracts.
