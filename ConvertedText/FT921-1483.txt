FT  24 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Bekaert slides to BFr652m
loss

   BRUSSELS


RESTRUCTURING costs hit Bekaert hard last year, turning a BFr508m profit at
the Belgian producer of wire and steel cord into a consolidated loss of
BFr652m (Dollars 18.8m). This compares with the 1990 loss of BFr454m.
Attempts to improve the group's competitiveness in steel cord and
engineering activities cost Bekaert BFr1.16bn in 1991, but the group pointed
out that operating margins and cash-flow had both improved.
The directors, who recommended a cut in Bekaert's dividend in 1990, have
decided to maintain the payout for 1991 at BFr100 per share.
Bekaert's profits collapsed in 1990 and cash-flow halved, but Mr Jean
Charles Velge, the chairman, said yesterday he felt the improving trend of
Bekaert's results would strengthen in 1992.
He pointed out that the improved 1991 results were almost entirely due to
internal efforts.
'Bekaert is not counting on a general economic recovery. We count first and
foremost on our own strengths,' he said.
Volume and turnover fell again last year, reflecting the continued economic
uncertainty in Bekaert's overseas markets, particularly the US and UK, and
persistent and fierce competition among tyre-makers, the principal customers
for the group's steel cord.
Turnover dropped by 7 per cent to BFr53bn from BFr57bn, and sales volume
slipped by 6.7 per cent.
Depreciation charges rose to a new high of BFr3.6bn as a result of the
group's heavy investment programme. Cash-flow recovered to BFr3.99m compared
with BFr2.66m, but that was still short of the 1989 figure of BFr5.68m.
