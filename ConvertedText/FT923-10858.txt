FT  28 JUL 92 / BCCI report delivered to Bank


LORD Justice Bingham's report on the closure of Bank of Credit and Commerce
International, the collapsed banking group, has been delivered to the
Treasury and the Bank of England.
Lord Bingham was commissioned last year by the government to investigate the
roles of the Bank of England and other official bodies in the events leading
up to BCCI's collapse in July last year.
Treasury lawyers will determine what can be released without prejudicing
future criminal prosecutions or infringing the Banking Act. Publication is
unlikely until early September.
