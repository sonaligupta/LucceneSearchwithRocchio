FT  12 NOV 92 / International Company News: Telecom Argentina trebles
profits to Dollars 150m

TELECOM Argentina, one of the country's two privatised telephone companies,
has almost trebled 1992 net profit to about Dollars 150m in the financial
year to September, from Dollars 53.3m in 1991. However, the company would
not provide other data.
Last week, Telefonica de Argentina, the largest telecom operator, also
reported net income up sharply with a 88 per cent rise to Dollars 222m and a
57 per cent increase in sales to Dollars 1.63bn.
However, the 1991 figures for both companies are slightly understated
because they cover an 11-month accounting period.
Argentina's two telephone companies have posted impressive gains after the
notoriously inefficient and corrupt state company was privatised in November
1990.
Gains have come from a big increase in lines, a steep reduction in jobs and
indexed telephone charges, further magnified by an overvalued exchange rate.
Consumers, however, permanently complain of poor service, despite company
efforts to tighten up management. Telecom says it invested Dollars 770m in
1992.
