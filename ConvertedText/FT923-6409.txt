FT  25 AUG 92 / Correction: Newsagents


THE National Federation of Retail Newsagents states that it was by mutual
agreement with the Daily Telegraph that it was unable to comment on last
Thursday's proceedings in the High Court, rather than by a court order as
reported in last Friday's FT. The NFRN says it remains free to comment on
the dispute between newsagents and the Telegraph over retailers' margins.
