FT  16 DEC 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Slow speed town traffic
transmitted


   By VANESSA HOULDER


Measuring the speed of traffic flows in towns can be difficult because
vehicles are constantly stopping and starting.
Trafficmaster, a company that provides live traffic information to
motorists, believes it has overcome this problem by devising a system that
uses video cameras and number plate recognition software to track the speed
at which traffic moves through two points on the road.
A video camera photographs the number plates of a batch of cars, which are
digitised and transmitted by radio signal to a site further down the road,
where another camera photographs the targeted number plates.
Trafficmaster plans to install the equipment early next year on two London
routes. The company will destroy the sightings data after its use to protect
drivers' privacy.
