FT  01 JUL 92 / Europe, the state of the union: UK sees future - and it
hurts


   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor


With the Danes' rejection of the Maastricht treaty, the EC's future has been
thrown into uncertainty. Today Britain takes over as president of the
Community. Can John Major give it new direction? In a special four page
pull-out FT writers assess the prospects
MR JOHN MAJOR'S stated ambition is to keep Britain 'at the heart of Europe'.
The problem is that during 20 turbulent years in the EC it has never
ventured more than a few yards beyond the perimeter.
But the angry debates over the Maastricht treaty being played out at
Westminster should not be taken as a signal that Britain is about to retreat
again into surly isolationism.
Mr Major is serious in his judgment that a middle-ranking power stranded off
the coast of Europe can no longer afford to be a reluctant participant in a
game whose rules are constantly adjusted on the other side of the Channel.
The noise generated by those at Westminster who would prefer Britain to cut
loose from anything more than the 'Common Market' is in inverse proportion
to their numbers.
Led by Mrs Margaret Thatcher, they are by and large of the generation which
harbours personal memories of the second world war. It is a generation which
has still to come to terms with the economic and political might of a
once-defeated Germany; one which still looks instinctively to Washington.
But the nation's ruling classes - at Westminster, in the City of London and
among captains of industry - see no option but to bind Britain's future to
Europe's. As one businessman turned senior minister puts it: 'Europe is the
future. It is such a pity it has taken us so long to admit it.'
The people too have begun to come to terms with Europe. A generation which
has grown up accustomed to Mediterranean package holidays has become less
certain of the assumption that British is best.
And yet. If as a nation Britain is reconciled to a future bound to that of
its European partners, it is reluctant still to welcome the prospect.
Mrs Thatcher and her allies know well that the frequent tabloid tirades
against Brussels bureaucracy, French farmers and fisherman and German
economic success strike a chord with a sizeable chunk of the electorate.
The demonology which surrounds Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president,
reflects a deep-seated ambivalence among politicians as well as voters about
any transfer of sovereignty - illusory or otherwise - to Brussels.
And while the decline in the country's relative prosperity reminds political
and business leaders that there is no option other than to compete and win
in Europe, for others it stokes nationalist resentment.
