FT  05 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Failure of Topic hits market commissions


   By TERRY BYLAND


A PROLONGED failure in the London Stock Exchange Topic news and information
service caused a substantial loss of commission business for market firms
yesterday. Many institutional investors ceased to deal because of the
absence of reliable share price information.
The Topic system was unable to transmit for most of the session, due to a
software problem. The Stock Exchange Automated Quotations network (Seaq)
operated normally, but share price quotations were 'indicative' and not
binding on market makers.
The FT-SE 100 Index was partly indicative, and the FT-SE Eurotrack indices
was wholly indicative at the close.
The problems fell mostly on investment clients, including unit trusts,
merchant banks, and pension funds. In the absence of screen quotations, fund
managers had to choose between dealing 'blind' at the share prices quoted by
marketmakers over the telephone, or to withdraw temporarily from the market.
'For them, it was rather like stepping up to the crease at baseball with a
sack over your head and trying to hit the ball,' commented Mr Nigel Little
of Panmure Gordon, the UK brokerage house. Most managers soon decided to
quit the field.
Most of the large securities firms, including the market makers, were able
to take market information on digital feeds from the Stock Exchange which
were unaffected. This information is then fed into the firms' own in-house
computer networks, giving traders access to most of the normal market
information and data.
The loss in client business will not be known until this morning.
Yesterday's Seaq volume total of 505.9m shares compared fairly well with
Wednesday's 473.6m. But the Seaq total takes in trade from both clients and
market makers. Market maker business was high yesterday as the London-based
houses arbitraged between stock index futures and the underlying stocks.
