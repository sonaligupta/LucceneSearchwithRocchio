FT  09 JAN 92 / Appointments: Sallying forth


SALOMON Brothers International, still struggling to regain its position in
the international capital markets after revelations of US Treasury
market-rigging last summer, is waiting to see whether the seasonal flow of
staff departures in the new year will turn into a flood.
The first to leave the ship in 1992 was the firm's head of bond syndication,
Simon Meadows, who has joined Credit Suisse First Boston as co-head of debt
syndication with John Walsh. A spokesman for Salomon Brothers says the
position is likely to be filled internally.
Meadows' move follows the departure last November of Ian Hannam, head of
equity syndicate, who left as a result of the internal restructuring in the
wake of the Treasury scandal. Hannam was replaced by Jeremy Palmer, an
internal appointment. Both these positions were key roles in Salomon's core
business, which has already suffered in the aftermath ; Salomon slipped from
sixth to 16th in the 1991 table of international bond underwriters,
according to Euromoney Bondware.
An official at Salomon Brothers points out that staff turnover at the firm
is traditionally at its highest in the first quarter. Last year, 136 staff
left, around 50 in the first three months. Salomon's ability to stem the
flow will be one measure of its recovery.
