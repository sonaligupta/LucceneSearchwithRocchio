FT  23 APR 93 / UK Company News: Alexander Proudfoot halved to Pounds 25m


   By ANGUS FOSTER


ALEXANDER Proudfoot, the management consultant which saw its shares collapse
last year on trading and management worries, yesterday announced profits
down by nearly 50 per cent due to recession and one-off costs.
Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 50.1m to Pounds 25.2m in the year to
December 31. At the interim stage profits fell from Pounds 23.8m to Pounds
12m; Proudfoot said then that the full year dividend would be maintained,
but yesterday it changed its mind and recommended a cut in the final from
13.5p to 6p, reducing the total to 12p (19.5p), payable from earnings of
18.2p (51.6p) per share.
Mr John Prosser, who was appointed group chief executive last year after a
management shake-up, said the dividend cut reflected the company's caution.
'Trading conditions will continue to be difficult in 1993,' he said.
Turnover was Pounds 172.4m (Pounds 176.4m), including a full year's
contribution from Indevo, the Swedish consultant acquired in 1991. Excluding
Indevo, turnover fell 6 per cent to Pounds 158m.
Indevo has continued to lose money, and Proudfoot has decided to close the
company down. This will lead to an exceptional charge this year of about
Pounds 17m, reflecting closure costs of Pounds 1.8m and goodwill write-offs
of Pounds 15.2m.
Management reorganisation costs totalled Pounds 3m. A previously announced
provision of Pounds 6m to cover unpaid overseas tax has been reduced to
Pounds 2.3m.
Losses in Scandinavia led to an increased tax charge of 54 per cent (36 per
cent).
After several senior management departures last year, three more directors -
including former finance director Mr Neil Hamilton - announced they will
stand down at the annual meeting due next month. Mr David Gill will join the
company as finance director from Avis Europe. Mr Prosser said Lord Stevens
would stay on as chairman.
