FT  12 MAR 92 / Election '92: BMA to debate health reforms


THE GOVERNMENT faces the embarrassment of its health reforms meeting further
criticism from the medical profession during the general election campaign.
It is holding a special delegate conference in London on March 26 to
consider motions on the reforms.
The agenda for the conference, published yesterday, shows that many of the
BMA's divisions remain opposed to the reforms a year after their
introduction. Only a single motion supports the further development of GP
fundholding.
