FT  22 OCT 92 / Romania lifts petrol price


   By REUTER


   BUCHAREST


Romania doubled the price of petrol yesterday to bring it in line with a
heavy decline in the value of the local currency, the leu, Reuter reports
from Bucharest.
The decision was announced as caretaker Prime Minister Theodor Stolojan was
preparing to make way for a new coalition government - likely to be
announced next week - based on the results of the September 27 general
election.
Premium fuel rose to 220 lei from 120 lei a litre (Dollars 2.32 from Dollars
1.27 per imperial gallon). A 40-litre per driver monthly allowance of
subsidised gasoline was raised to 100 lei from 50 lei a litre.
