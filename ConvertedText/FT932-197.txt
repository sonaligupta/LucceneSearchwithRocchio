FT  30 JUN 93 / Call for tugs to fight sea pollution


A NETWORK of sea-going salvage tugs capable of taking in tow crippled oil
tankers and bulk carriers should be established, Mr Mike Lacey, a salvage
consultant, urged yesterday.
He told Lord Donaldson's public inquiry into marine pollution that four
powerful tugs should be stationed off the Isle of Wight, the river Tees,
between the Shetlands and the Orkneys and between Anglesey and the Isle of
Man.
The cost would be about Pounds 6m a year. That was not excessive 'when one
considers the costs of damage for clean-up following an oil spill'.
