FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: CTR cuts loss to Pounds 7.2m as
exceptionals plummet


   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE


Losses at Central Transport Rental Group, formerly Tiphook, fell sharply in
the six months to October 31, declining from Pounds 179.7m to Pounds 7.2m,
as the company reported lower exceptional charges and an improvement in
trading.
The interest charge was halved at Pounds 20.6m (Pounds 40.6m) and the
results were additionally flattered by a Pounds 19.3m foreign currency gain
on its US bonds.
Mr Ian Clubb, the non-executive chairman who joined the board three months
ago, said the results marked a turning point in the group's fortunes.
In the past year, CTR has parted with several directors, run up hefty
losses, been forced to sell its container leasing division and had the
ignominy of its chief executive, Mr Robert Montague, facing bankruptcy
charges.
Turnover fell to Pounds 73.4m (Pounds 155.7m) for operating losses of Pounds
2.2m (Pounds 139.1m). However, the company said continuing operations showed
turnover ahead 8.5 per cent for operating profits of Pounds 9m, compared
with losses Pounds 2.4m.
Losses per share fell from 163.4p to 6.5p.
Sales in the trailer rental division improved by 9 per cent to Pounds 67.1m
as it pushed through rental rises of 3.4 per cent. Utilisation rates also
improved. In the rail wagon rental business, turnover rose Pounds 200,000 to
Pounds 6m.
Exceptional charges fell from Pounds 154.6m to Pounds 14.9m. This included
Pounds 2.2m in redundancy and reorganisation costs. CTR relocates this
weekend from its prestigious central London address to smaller premises in
High Wycombe with a central office staff of 30, a tenth of the figure
employed at its peak. Administrative expenses over the half declined from
Pounds 49.4m to Pounds 22.9m.
Mr Clubb said that with a four-year agreement with its bankers only recently
begun, the group had enough working capital to continue its operations and
maintain capital investment. A financial reconstruction was planned at some
stage, probably during 1995.
However, a contract with Schmitz, a German manufacturer of trailers with
which CTR has a long-term supply contract, was not provided for. The
contract would cost the group Pounds 161m over the next five years, with the
next payment of Pounds 18m due in April 1997.
'With our improving cash flow and market position, I don't see this being a
problem at all,' said Mr Clubb.
He reiterated the board's view that the personal finances of Mr Montague,
who has two bankruptcy writs outstanding and reputed debts of some Pounds
40m, were his affair. 'But he would not be working for us if he did not add
value,' he added.
