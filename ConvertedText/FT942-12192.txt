FT  30 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Hostile bid for Lasmo - At a glance


Enterprise Oil launched a Pounds 1.45bn hostile takeover bid for rival
explorer Lasmo yesterday. If successful, the offer would bring together the
UK's two largest independent oil and gas explorers into a single group
valued at more than Pounds 3bn.
The offer is the largest hostile bid in the UK since BTR's Pounds 1.47bn
offer for Hawker Siddeley in 1991. If the bid succeeds the enlarged company
would rank fourth among North Sea explorers, after British Petroleum, Shell
and Exxon.
Lasmo attacked the bid as a contrived paper offer which would dilute
significant growth potential for shareholders.
