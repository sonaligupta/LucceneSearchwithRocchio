FT  05 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Williamson Tea advances 68%


Firmer tea prices, reflecting the shortfall of world crops, helped
Williamson Tea raise annual profits by 68 per cent to Pounds 6.22m.
The advance from last time's Pounds 3.71m for the 12 months to March 31 came
on turnover ahead to Pounds 34m (Pounds 30.9m).
The group, which produces tea in India, Kenya and Tanzania, said the outcome
was also buoyed by a 'greatly increased' contribution from its Indian
associate.
The final dividend goes up to 12.5p, making 22.5p (20p) for the year,
covered 4.9 times by earnings of 109.74p (37.78p) per share.
