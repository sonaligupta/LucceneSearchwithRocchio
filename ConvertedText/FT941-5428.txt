FT  07 MAR 94 / Labour vows end to school rankings


Labour pledged yesterday to end competition between schools as well as the
national league table of performance.
Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, said that a Labour government
would end the practice whereby schools 'compete against each other in a
market situation'.
She declared on BBC television that national league tables were a waste of
government money and unnecessary for parents. who needed only to know about
their local schools.
Mrs Taylor added that grant-maintained status was not the way forward.
Labour put the emphasis on the need for equity in resourcing.
Also yesterday it was made clear that Mr John Patten, the education
secretary, plans to proceed with plans to cut surplus school places by
closing schools.
But the Department for Education said there would be fewer than 100
closures. The department denied a Sunday newspaper report that as many as
1,000 schools would be closed.
New powers contained in the Education Act 1993, which comes into force in
April, give Mr Patten the ability to force local authorities to take action
to close schools.
