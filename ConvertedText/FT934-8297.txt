FT  16 NOV 93 / International Company News: Fairfax sees profit double in
quarter


   By NIKKI TAIT


JOHN FAIRFAX, the Australian newspaper and media group in which Mr Conrad
Black, the Canadian media mogul, holds a minority interest, yesterday
announced that profits after tax and abnormal items more than doubled in the
first quarter to end-September.
The Australian group made ADollars 38.9m (USDollars 25.6m), compared with
just ADollars 17.4m in the same period of 1992.
This year's figures benefited from a ADollars 13.4m 'abnormal' income tax
gain, and also from lower interest charges, which fell from ADollars 14.6m a
year ago to ADollars 10.6m this time. However, earnings before interest and
tax were also up by 12 per cent, at ADollars 49.5m, while operating revenues
advanced by 7.6 per cent, to ADollars 209.2m.
In a brief statement, the company said that classified and display
advertising volumes carried by The Sydney Morning Herald and by the Age in
Melbourne, two of its flagship newspapers, had increased 'in line with
improving trading conditions'.
'The increase in advertising volumes, together with rate and cover price
increases, account for the increased revenue,' Fairfax added.
