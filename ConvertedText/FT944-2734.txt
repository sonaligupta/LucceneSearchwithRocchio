FT  16 DEC 94 / International Company News: US oil group cancels financing


   By ROBERT GIBBENS


Clark USA, the oil refiner and distributor controlled by Toronto financier
Mr Peter Munk, has withdrawn a USDollars 250m financing because of weakening
capital markets, writes Robert Gibbens.
Clark, wholly-owned by Horsham Corp, Mr Munk's main holding company, had
planned to offer 7.5m shares publicly to raise Dollars 150m, and to issue
Dollars 100m of senior notes.
The shares would have represented one-third of the total outstanding.
The financing was to cover the acquisition of a Chevron refinery in the US.
'We won't sell our shares in a weak market,' said Mr Paul Melnuk, Clark
president. 'We believe market conditions will improve later.'
