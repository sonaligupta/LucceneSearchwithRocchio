FT  20 APR 94 / Business Air Travel (20): Airports of the world - Advantage
of being near to Brussels / Zaventem


   By LIONEL BARBER


Time is money, so the biggest advantage of Zaventem airport is how near it
is to downtown Brussels. A 20-minute ride on the train costs a paltry BFr85
(less than Dollars 3). Driving takes between 20 and 25 minutes, providing
you do not travel between 4pm and 6.30pm when there is a high risk of being
trapped in city tunnel traffic. Taxis cost a hefty BFr1,200 (Dollars 40).
At first sight, the airport is unappealing. The arrival lounge has a mangy
bar which is full of stale smoke. The foyer teems with illegal cabbies on
the look-out for gullible foreigners. Heathrow's Terminal One looks
luxurious by comparison.
Further inside, standards pick up. Airline staff are courteous, and the
check-in queues shift quickly. Baggage handling is speedy and reliable.
Duty-free shops have the best chocolate in Europe. The executive lounge
looks as good as most. What is missing is a good toy shop for children's
presents and a high-class restaurant.
On the other hand, Zaventem does not specialise in transit connections,
unlike Schipol or Heathrow. It is a one-stop shop whose chief appeal is the
lack of crowds.
Two quibbles. Passport checking is irritatingly slow for a country which has
signed up to the Schengen agreement (the accord between European Union
member states which is supposed to make travel between signatory countries
pain-free). Brussels officials say that all will come good once airport
reconstruction is complete. The sullen expression on the faces of customs
officials suggests otherwise.
Second, there never quite seems enough parking space inside the airport
garage which is some way from the arrival and departure exits. Motorists may
need to kerb-crawl for up to 10 minutes to look for a vacant slot among the
6,000 allotted places. It is no particular consolation that parking costs a
fairly reasonable BFr295 a day.
