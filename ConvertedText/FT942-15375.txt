FT  15 APR 94 / Observer: Burundi Bill


Of course, Bill Clinton would never say a bad word in public about Bob
Krueger. Sure, the former senator from Texas, appointed to fill Lloyd
Bentsen's seat, often voted against his president, though both are
Democrats. True, Krueger got thrashed by Kay Bailey Hutchison last year,
giving the Lone Star state far too Republican a look and the Senate a
smaller Democratic majority.
Such political adroitness is deserving of its own special rewards: thus Bob
Krueger has just been nominated as the next US ambassador to Burundi.
