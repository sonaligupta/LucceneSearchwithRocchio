FT  05 AUG 93 / People: Heaps steps up at Britannia BSoc


John Heaps, 54, the new managing director of Britannia Building Society, the
country's ninth biggest, says that his new job is not as big a step as it
looks.
He has been deputy managing director since October 1991 and as his boss,
Michael Shaw, has been chairman of the Building Societies Association, Heaps
has been running the society as the effective chief operating officer.
Shaw, who is expected to retire next year, has been appointed executive vice
chairman and will continue to be chairman of Britannia Life, one of the UK's
fastest growing life companies with assets of over Pounds 1.5bn. Although
Heaps stresses the continuity of management style, he is likely to adopt a
higher public profile than Shaw.
In addition, whereas Shaw had an accountancy background, Heaps has come up
through the administration and information technology sides of the business.
He was chief executive of Colne Building Society until it was bought by
Britannia in 1983.
