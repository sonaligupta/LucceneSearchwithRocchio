FT  23 JUL 93 / UK Company News: TeleWest raises Pounds 190m to expand its
networks


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


TELEWEST, the UK's largest cable television operator with 3m homes under
franchise, has raised a Pounds 190m loan facility to build its networks.
The deal is believed to be the largest individual loan raised for the UK
cable industry and is a clear indication of the renewed interest in the UK
industry by the financial community.
TeleWest - a joint venture between TCI of Denver, the world's largest cable
operator, and US West, the American telephone company - will use the money
to press ahead building cable networks in south London and in the Bristol
and Bath area.
The company already provides a cable television service to nearly 160,000
customers and has 101,000 telephone lines in service.
Mr Ed Mattix, of TeleWest, said yesterday that cable was now very much a
combined television and telephone operation. 'The financial institutions are
very interested in the business (in the UK) and are as positive about its
future as we are,' he added.
The Toronto-Dominion Bank was the lead arranger of the eight and a half year
loan, which is fully underwritten. The co-arrangers were the Bank of Boston,
the Bank of Nova Scotia, Barclays, CIBC and SBC.
Another large financing - Pounds 160m for the Jones Cable Group - is
believed to be near completion put together by County NatWest.
Mr Richard Woollam, managing director of the Cable Television Association,
the industry trade body, said yesterday: 'I think people are starting to
wake up to what is going on in the cable industry.'
By the beginning of June there were 465,000 cable subscribers and 2.5m homes
were passed by cable networks giving a penetration rate, or ratio of
subscribers to those who could subscribe, of 21 per cent.
