FT  24 NOV 92 / International Company News: Terms of Hachette, Matra deal
out today

HACHETTE, the troubled French media group, and Matra, the defence
electronics, company are expected today to announce details of revised terms
for their merger.
The shares of both companies, together with those of MMB, the company that
controls them, were suspended on the Paris stock market pending an
announcement this morning.
The supervisory boards of the three companies, all chaired by the flamboyant
Mr Jean-Luc Lagardere and controlled by his family, met yesterday to discuss
the final plans for the merger.
Hachette, which owns the worldwide rights to Elle magazine, is also expected
to complete plans this week for its recapitalisation. The company's future
has been clouded by uncertainty since the collapse early of La Cinq, the
French television station in which it was the managing shareholder.
The group, which has also been burdened by the legacy of its over-ambitious
expansion in the US during the 1980s, remained in the red with net losses of
FFr39.3m (Dollars 7.4m) in the first half of this year.
Hachette announced this spring that it planned to raise FFr900m in new
equity, together with FFr600m from a convertible bond and FFr1.3bn from
subordinated notes. Mr Lagardere also astonished the Paris stock market by
disclosing plans to merge Hachette with the apparently incompatible Matra,
claiming their union would produce significant savings in central costs.
Matra and Hachette last month announced provisional terms for the merger in
which the former's investors were likely to be offered 11 Hachette shares
for every five of their existing shares.
However MMB's management has since indicated that the terms may be changed
in favour of Matra's shareholders, possibly along the lines of offering five
Hachette shares for every two Matra shares.
