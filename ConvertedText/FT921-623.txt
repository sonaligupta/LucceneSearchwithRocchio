FT  28 MAR 92 / Rise in income boosts spending


   By MICHAEL PROWSE


   WASHINGTON


US PERSONAL income rose 1.1 per cent in February, the largest monthly gain
for three years, the Commerce Department reported yesterday.
The surge in incomes, which exceeded Wall Street's expectations, helped
explain the surprisingly robust recovery in US retail spending since
Christmas. The higher spending has sparked speculation in recent weeks that
the long-awaited recovery from recession is under way.
In real, inflation-adjusted terms, yesterday's figures showed a 0.6 per cent
rise in personal consumption spending last month. Figures for January were
revised to show a gain of 0.9 per cent.
Many economists expect higher consumption spending to underpin a modest
growth of gross domestic product in the first quarter. Revised figures
released on Thursday showed GDP growing at an annual rate of 0.4 per cent in
the final quarter of last year, down from an earlier estimate of 0.8 per
cent growth.
Officials said the rise in incomes last month was boosted by special factors
including subsidy payments to farmers.
But an underlying increase estimated at 0.9 per cent reflected a sharp rise
in non-farm employment and a lengthening of the average working week.
With personal savings rates low, the recovery of consumption spending is
likely to be sustained only if employment continues to grow. Analysts are
thus keenly awaiting employment figures for March, due out next week, which
will provide a clearer picture of the economy's underlying momentum.
