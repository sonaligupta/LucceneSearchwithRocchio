FT  23 APR 93 / Drugs industry attacks policy


   By PAUL ABRAHAMS


GOVERNMENT POLICY towards the drugs industry was strongly attacked yesterday
by the Association of the British Pharmaceuticals Industry, Paul Abrahams
writes.
Mr Stewart Siddall, association president, said the extension of the list of
products for which the National Health Service would not pay had come as a
'real bombshell'.
He warned: 'Some companies will be profoundly damaged. I have correspondence
from one company which could lose all of its sales.' The proposals, which
had come without warning, could affect about Pounds 400m in annual sales.
The UK pharmaceutical industry generated exports of Pounds 3m last year,
four times more than Japan. Yet spending on medicines a head in the UK was
half that in in Germany, France and Italy, he said.
