FT  24 NOV 92 / Equality body to petition Lords


THE Equal Opportunities Commission is to petition the House of Lords for
leave to appeal against the Court of Appeal's ruling that it may not pursue
judicial review proceedings against the employment secretary.
It will also seek leave to appeal against the Appeal Court's judgment that
the government is not discriminating against part-time workers by requiring
them to work three years longer than full-timers to qualify for redundancy
and unfair dismissal rights, or by excluding them if they work fewer than
eight hours a week.
