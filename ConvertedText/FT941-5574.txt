FT  05 MAR 94 / International Company News: Isuzu Motors link with Suzuki to
be dissolved


   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO

Isuzu Motors, the Japanese truck and commercial vehicle maker, and Suzuki
Motor, the largest minicar producer in Japan, have agreed to dissolve their
business ties after almost 13 years.
The agreement, which frees each company to sell its stake in the other,
highlights the growing willingness of Japanese companies to unwind business
ties which have outlasted their usefulness. Susuki holds a little over 1 per
cent of Isuzu shares and Isuzu just over 2 per cent of Suzuki.
Isuzu, which is 37 per cent owned by General Motors of the US, and Suzuki,
in which GM has a 3 per cent stake, formed their business and capital link
in 1981 with the blessing of GM and in the hope that as fellow members of
the American group a tie-up would bring significant benefits.
However, the link has only led to a deal in which Suzuki provided Isuzu with
vans on an OEM (original equipment manufacturer) basis and one in which
Suzuki's commercial vehicles were manufactured at an Isuzu facility in the
UK which it jointly owned with GM.
The former resulted in just 1,500 vans being made between 1986 and 1988
while the latter led to 72,000 vehicles until last year. Both projects were
abandoned after the vehicles proved unpopular.
The two companies have had difficulty finding new joint business
opportunities and none have been formed since August last year. Isuzu is a
maker of trucks and large commercial vehicles while Suzuki makes cars under
1000cc.
