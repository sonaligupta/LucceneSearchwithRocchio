FT  12 APR 94 / Motorway toll plan faces probe


A public inquiry into plans for the Birmingham northern relief road, which
would be the first privately-financed toll motorway, was announced
yesterday.
The government will face opposition from environmental groups when the
inquiry opens in Walsall on June 21. More than 7,000 people and
organisations have objected to the 27-mile route which is designed to
relieve pressure on the M6.
The inquiry, to be held before independent inspector Sir John Fitzpatrick,
could take up to nine months.
The proposed road would be built and operated by Midland Expressway, a
company that has been formed by Trafalgar House, the shipping and hotels
group, and Grouppo IRI of Italy. It would provide a link around the
north-east side of the west Midlands conurbation from the M6, north of
junction 11, to the M6 east of junction 4.
