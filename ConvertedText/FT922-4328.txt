FT  05 JUN 92 / International Company News: May sales improve for top US
retailers


   By MARTIN DICKSON


   NEW YORK


MANY leading US retailing groups yesterday reported improved sales figures
for May, despite unseasonably cold weather, adding fresh evidence of slowly
improving consumer confidence and economic recovery.
Wal-Mart, the rapidly-expanding discount chain which is now the largest
retailer in the US by sales, reported a 12 per cent rise in same-store
revenues compared with May 1991. With its new outlets added to the total,
sales shot up 27 per cent to Dollars 4.44bn.
Rival discounter K mart reported a 1.8 per cent increase in comparable store
sales and an overall rise of 6.7 per cent, to Dollars 2.92bn.
Mr Joseph Antonini, chairman, said: 'The gain was achieved despite
colder-than-normal weather that adversely affected a number of important K
mart discount store spring businesses, most notably apparel and our outdoor
garden shop.'
However, JC Penney, the department store and catalogue group, reported a
sharp advance in clothing sales throughout the US as it reported an 8.8 per
cent increase in comparable store sales, and an overall increase of 9.8 per
cent, to Dollars 882m.
Sears, Roebuck, the Chicago-based stores and catalogue group, produced a 0.3
per cent increase in like-for-like sales and a 1.1 per cent increase in
total sales, to Dollars 1.71bn.
It said there were increases in major appliances, home office equipment and
furniture, 'continuing the trend started in January and indicating improving
confidence in the economic recovery as consumers undertake major purchases'.
But it added that the weather meant large sales declines in seasonal
products, such as lawn and garden equipment, air conditioners and some
clothing lines.
