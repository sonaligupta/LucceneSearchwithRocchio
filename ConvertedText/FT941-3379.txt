FT  16 MAR 94 / International Company News: Norske Skog to raise NKr800m

Norway's Norske Skog, one of Scandinavia's largest pulp and paper producers,
is making a two-step share issue to raise around NKr800m (Dollars 73m).
In the first step, NKr400m is to be raised through a 1-for-10 rights
offering, with preferential rights given to existing shareholders to
purchase shares of the same class. A subscription price of NKr150 per share
has been proposed.
The second step involves authorisation of the board to issue up to 2,650,000
restricted non-voting 'B' shares, aimed at international investors, to raise
another NKr400m.
'In order to broaden the company's investor base, it will be proposed that
existing shareholders waive their preferential rights for the international
offering,' Norske Skog said.
Mr Jarle Langfjaeran, a company executive, said the proceeds of the two
offerings would increase financial flexibility to undertake a number of
planned projects.
He said that in 1994, Norske Skog intended to build a new de-inking plant in
Norway used for the treatment of waste paper. Construction is to begin later
this year. At the domestic Tofte chemical pulp mill, there is a programme to
gradually convert the mill to total chlorine-free pulp. Elsewhere in Norway,
a new saw line is to be installed at an existing mill, while there are a
number of other minor projects planned for this year.
