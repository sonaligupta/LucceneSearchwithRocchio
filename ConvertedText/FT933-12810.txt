FT  22 JUL 93 / Observer: Diplomatic?


Few if any Japanese diplomats have vaulted as effortlessly over cultural
barriers as did Kazuo Chiba, Japan's ambassador in London from 1988-91.
Mastering even the self-deprecating after-dinner funny, he is remembered
affectionately by many.
Now freed from what he calls his 'sanitised' diplomatic persona, Chiba
exceeded even his admirers' expectations yesterday when he launched a
pamphlet on EC-Japanese trade relations, co-produced by the Royal Institute
of International Affairs and its Japanese opposite number.
First, he set himself a tongue-twister few other Japanese would attempt, by
using 'irrelevant' and 'irreverent' in the same sentence.
Then he recalled how former French prime minister Edith Cresson had insisted
on telling Arthur Dunkel, the previous Gatt director general, in Chiba's
presence that 'les Japonais trichent, je le sais', not realising that he
understood French.
And finally he asserted that Karel van Wolferen, author of The Enigma of
Japanese Power, had 'lived 25 years with a Japanese woman as a partner but
without learning our language: no wonder he finds Japan an enigma'.
After which, perhaps feeling he had overdone it just a shade, he added:
'Let's forget about the 25-year partner. I understand she's a hairdresser.'
