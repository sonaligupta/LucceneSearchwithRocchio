FT  22 APR 91 / Bill aims to ease US swaps


   By Our Financial Staff


A BILL passed last week by the US Senate on the reform of the futures
markets will remove significant legal uncertainties for the huge market in
interest rate and currency swaps, according to the International Swap
Dealers Association.
The legislation, which will allow swaps to be exempted from the provisions
of the Commodity Exchange Act, 'will benefit users of swaps and swap dealers
by removing legal uncertainty,' according to Mr Mark Brickell, the
association's chairman.
Swaps are agreements to exchange cash flows. They are usually entered into
by companies, banks or governments to regulate their exposure to movements
in exchange or interest rates.
The association said it lobbied for three years to be exempted from the act,
which requires the trading of commodities on exchanges. The association
claims that this requirement has, in the past, pushed significant swap
activity to offshore markets.
After the bill is enacted and swaps exempted from the act, dealers would be
able to develop new swap products and risk reduction techniques, the
association said in a statement.
The bill will now move to a conference of the Senate and the House of
Representatives before enactment. Its easy passage of the Senate was an
'important step', the association claimed.
The bill, which was 2 1/2 years reaching the Senate floor, tightens trading
rules on futures exchanges and strengthens the Commodities Futures Trading
Commission.
