FT  04 SEP 93 / German recycling scheme credits extended


GERMAN municipalities and waste management companies yesterday agreed to
extend credits to save the national recycling scheme from bankruptcy.
Mr Klaus Topfer, the environment minister, said his controversial recycling
scheme still offered a viable solution for disposing of household waste.
More funds are expected from industry to meet the scheme's DM860m deficit.
Critics said yesterday's decision was a temporary rescue which would not
cure the system's structural problems.
