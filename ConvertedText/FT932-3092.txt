FT  16 JUN 93 / Extra Pounds 6.4bn sought for Tube


   By RICHARD TOMKINS


LONDON'S heavily subsidised Underground railway could become self-sufficient
financially if the government invested an extra Pounds 6.4bn over the next
10 years, the network claimed yesterday, Richard Tomkins writes.
London Underground said the extra money, which would more than double
government investment in the network, was needed to bring the railway up to
date after decades of comparative neglect.
The sum were published as part of the Underground's campaign to secure as
favourable a settlement as possible in the public-spending round.
The network said about Pounds 8.5bn was needed over 10 years to deliver the
'decently modern metro' that London deserved. Part of this could be financed
through efficiency gains and higher fares.
It said an independent study showed that the government would more than
recoup the remaining Pounds 6.4bn through extra tax revenues and reduced
unemployment benefits resulting from the jobs generated by the improved
railway.
Once the investment programme had been completed the core network would not
only cover its operating costs, but also the cost of refurbishing and
renewing the railway.
