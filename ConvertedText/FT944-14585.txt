FT  22 OCT 94 / Russian tax collection lower than planned


   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND


In the first nine months of 1994 the Russian federal government has
collected only 37.3 per cent of the tax and other revenues it counted on
receiving this year, according to a Ministry of Finance report released
yesterday, writes Chrystia Freeland. The report suggests that low rates of
tax collection have played a significant role in creating the fiscal crisis
that contributed to the crash of the rouble last week and prompted the
Russian cabinet on Thursday to adopt a more austere budget for 1995.
A 16 per cent decline in GDP - higher than the government had predicted when
drawing up the 1994 budget - and lower levels of inflation are, according to
Russian officials, partially responsible for the low levels of tax
collection. But economists believe that evasion and capital flight are
largely to blame.
