FT  12 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Sanderson Murray hit by interest


SANDERSON Murray & Elder (Holdings), the North Yorkshire-based motor dealer,
saw profits dip 8 per cent, from Pounds 1.53m to Pounds 1.41m pre-tax, over
the 1992 year.
The outcome masked a marginal improvement in operating profits - from Pounds
1.64m to Pounds 1.91m on continuing operations. Net interest charges,
however, rose to Pounds 500,000 (Pounds 133,000) reflecting cash
acquisitions.
Turnover, boosted by the acquisitions, jumped to Pounds 107m (Pounds 72.3m),
including a contribution of Pounds 5.73m (Pounds 7.57m) from discontinued
operations.
A proposed final dividend of 1.4p maintains the total for the year at 2p,
covered just over 3 times by earnings of 6.2p (8.7p).
The results were compiled under FRS 3.
