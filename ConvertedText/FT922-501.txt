FT  27 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Burnfield calls for Pounds 22.7m to fund
Malvern acquisition


   By ROLAND RUDD


BURNFIELD, the specialist engineering group, is asking shareholders for
Pounds 22.7m by way of a 3-for-4 rights issue to pay for an agreed
acquisition of Malvern Instruments from Cray Electronics Holdings.
Malvern Instruments has 33 per cent of the world market in laser-based
particle characterisation equipment which break down particles in substances
such as paper and paint.
Burnfield purchased Malvern, which reported operating profits of Pounds 2m
on sales of Pounds 14.7m for the year to April 30, for Pounds 20m.
It will be incorporated as a third separate business to Burnfield's two
existing ones: Isopad, which makes electric surface heating systems, and
Budenberg, which produces pressure gauges.
Mr Brian McGowan, chairman, who is also chief executive of the industrial
conglomerate Williams Holdings, said he was confident of boosting profits by
bringing Malvern under tight management control.
Worldwide sales of laser-based particle characterisation equipment are
expected to grow from Pounds 40m to about Pounds 70m in four years.
The purchase will eliminate Cray Electronics' debt and allow it to
concentrate on its information technology business.
Burnfield's shares yesterday fell 9p to close at 206p. The new shares are
being offered at 165p. The issue is fully underwritten by Barclays de Zoete
Wedd.
The rights issue is expected to leave Burnfield with net cash of Pounds 4m
which Mr McGowan said would be used for smaller bolt-on acquisitions on the
Continent.
For the year March 31 1991 Burnfield turned a pre-tax loss of Pounds 3.2m
into a profit of Pounds 1.17m.
