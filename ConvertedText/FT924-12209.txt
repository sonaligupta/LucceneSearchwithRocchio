FT  22 OCT 92 / Honecker to stand trial for wall deaths


   By LESLIE COLITT


   BERLIN


Mr Erich Honecker, the ailing former communist leader of East Germany, will
stand trial on November 12 on charges that he bore responsibility for the
fatal shooting of East Germans trying to flee across the border to the west,
writes Leslie Colitt in Berlin.
The decision was taken by the Berlin justice authorities although Mr
Honecker, 80, was found to be terminally ill with liver cancer. A
court-appointed physician said he had 18 months to live at the most.
Mr Nicolas Becker, his lawyer, said the trial was being used by the west
German authorities to try to incriminate the whole former communist system.
Mr Willi Stoph, the former East German prime minister, will also to go on
trial for the killings, along with Mr Erich Mielke, former head of the Stasi
security police, Mr Heinz Kessler, the former defence minister, Mr Fritz
Streletz, his deputy, and Mr Hans Albrecht, the communist leader of Suhl
District, on the inner-German border.
