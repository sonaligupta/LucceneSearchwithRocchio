FT  27 SEP 94 / Survey of Mauritius (2): Sustaining the miracle - Tony
Hawkins finds that diversification is essential for future growth


   By TONY HAWKINS


'We've done the easy part,' says a Mauritian businessman. 'From here on, its
going to be uphill all the way,' No-one disagrees.
For a decade or more the Mauritian miracle has been driven by the Export
Processing Zone (EPZ), more specifically by the clothing and textile sector.
The EPZ's share in GDP has more than doubled in the past 10 years from 5.2
per cent in 1983 to 12.5 per cent last year.
Net exports have risen 13-fold to MRs6.5bn, while the EPZ share in total
exports is now 70 per cent - up from a third 10 years ago. The zone now
accounts for 27 per cent of total employment, as against 12 per cent in
1983.
But that is yesterday's story. As the labour market tightened in the late
1980s and the island attained full and then over-employment, the EPZ began
to lose the competitive edge secured on the basis of low-cost labour. Output
growth has slowed from 26 per cent annually during the 1984-88 period, to 6
per cent a year since 1989. Employment, which had peaked at almost 91,000 in
1991 had fallen nearly 8 per cent by March this year.
Some of this is part of an inevitable restructuring process; the number of
enterprises quadrupled between 1983 when there were 146 EPZ firms and 1988
when the total reached 591. The subsequent shake-out has seen a net loss of
71 enterprises, with the number of closures, in the past 2 1/2 years
exceeding new ventures. In spite of this exports continue to expand,
increasing 37 per cent to MRs15.8bn since 1990.
Restructuring has three objectives - diversification away from the heavy
dependence on clothing and on exports to a narrow range of industrial
country markets; moving upmarket in the clothing sector to higher
value-added activities, and increasing output while shedding labour.
Diversification within the clothing sector - by increasing value-added  -
appears to have made more progress than attempts to broaden the zone's
industrial base. More than half the 520 EPZ enterprises make clothing while
another 30 firms (5.8 per cent) are in textiles. The largest non-clothing
segment is flowers (50 firms), followed by paper and wood products (26) and
jewellery (20).
Last year, clothing exports accounted for 80 per cent of total EPZ sales and
textiles for a further 4 per cent. The main non-clothing exports were clocks
and watches, which made up 3.9 per cent of the total.
In spite of efforts to diversify, this pattern has barely changed; in 1986,
60 per cent of the 365 enterprises were in clothing and textiles.
Ramakrishna Sithanen, the island's minister of finance, is confident that
the diversification effort - into printing, electronics, engineering,
jewellery - will bear fruit over the next few years. Indeed, one senior EPZ
official predicts that by the turn of the century Mauritian printers will
have supplanted the clothing industry as the EPZ's main player.
Market diversification is crucial too; four markets buy three-quarters of
EPZ exports. France is the lead market with 28 per cent, followed by the US
(25 per cent), Britain (14 per cent) and Germany (9 per cent). These markets
are increasingly at risk not just from fierce Asian-based competition, but
also from restructuring within the EU and US markets themselves.
The phasing out of the Multi-Fibre Agreement and the loss of Lome
preferences over the next 10 years, underline the long-term need to
diversify markets and products. Restructuring was forced on the EPZ, not
just by the labour shortage and the need to find a new competitive advantage
to replace low-cost labour, but also by the fast-changing world economic
order.
With labour costs having doubled in the past four years, according to one
industrialist, Mauritius is no longer a player at the bottom end of the
garment market. New Asian producers - China, India, Vietnam, Sri Lanka,
Bangladesh - are forcing Mauritius to head up market in search of
higher-quality, higher value-added activities, with a greater emphasis on
design, style, flexibility and just-in-time delivery.
In spinning, with labour costs of Dollars 1.42 an hour, Mauritius is now a
far more costly location than Malaysia (Dollars 1.18), Thailand (Dollars
1.04) Philippines (78c), India (56c), Pakistan (44c), Vietnam (37c) and
China (36c).
Accordingly, it must now compete on quality and product differentiation
rather than price. This is not easy given that Mauritius has no large
hinterland market on its doorstep and incurs higher transport costs and
longer delivery times than many of its Asian competitors.
Multinationals are conspicuously absent from the EPZ which means few
Mauritian firms fit the modern model of globally-integrated businesses,
though the country's largest manufacturer, the Floreal group, the world's
second largest producer of woolmark products after Benetton of Italy, is
heading in that direction.
Five years ago, it went offshore to neighbouring Madagascar locating its
labour-intensive operations there in what has proved to be a highly
successful venture. Today it is looking further afield at China, India or
even, on a modest scale, the UK or France.
Investment figures are also indicative of the modest role of foreign
business in the EPZ showing that foreign capital has accounted for 28 per
cent of new capital projects since the mid-80s.
Going upmarket means heavy investment in both hardware and software. Only in
the past few years has Mauritius focused on training, with encouraging
results. In the EPZ, the productivity index (1982 = 100) which averaged 87
during the 1980s, has since risen 50 per cent.
More and better training and slicker management is only part of the story.
EPZ firms have invested heavily in state-of-the-art equipment - an average
of MRs700m annually in the past five years. Floreal management says its
CAD-CAM computerised plant is as good as, if not better than, that anywhere
in the world.
The government is doing its bit to help boost productivity and quality. Its
new Technology Diffusion Scheme, supported by the World Bank, will help EPZ
manufacturers access the technology and expertise necessary to compete in
global markets.
Under the programme, an estimated 250 firms will benefit from grants of some
Dollars 10,000 each. Grant funds may be used to pay 50 per cent of the cost
of external technology support services designed to improve productivity,
product quality, design and manufacturing response times.
A second initiative, launched two years ago, is the EPZ Development
Authority charged with helping Mauritius make the difficult transition from
a labour-abundant to a skills-intensive economy, by boosting technology,
management and productivity. Investment and value-added numbers point to
some progress along this difficult road.
In the four years to 1991, value-added per worker, at constant prices, rose
20 per cent in the EPZ sector, increasing 25 per cent in textiles and 18 per
cent in clothing. Value-added is forecast to grow more rapidly this year - 8
per cent - underlining the fact that it is premature to write its obituary.
It is still expanding faster than GDP as a whole and boosting its relative
importance to the economy.
But as labour costs escalate and labour shortages worsen, this will become
ever more difficult to achieve without accelerating the transition to the
information and knowledge-based economy which is now the country's goal.
