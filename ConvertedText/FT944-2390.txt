FT  16 DEC 94 / People: Aitken-Davies signals Railtrack's route


   By CHARLES BATCHELOR


The government has picked Richard Aitken-Davies to be director of
Railtrack's privatisation unit. It hopes to float the company, which has
taken over British Rail's tracks, signalling and stations, in the first
three months of 1996 but many questions remain to be answered before the
market can hazard its value.
Crucially, the level of charges it can levy on the train operating companies
has to obtain the Rail Regulator's approval early next year.
Aitken-Davies, 45, the man who will be most closely responsible for steering
Railtrack to a successful flotation, was formerly director of corporate
finance at PowerGen. He was financial controller at the state-owned CEGB
before it was broken up into PowerGen and three other companies in 1989. He
helped create PowerGen's capital structure and orchestrate its flotation. He
believes his experience with PowerGen will stand him in good stead at
Railtrack. 'They are both new companies formed from much larger
organisations with no track record of their own,' he says. 'We will have to
go out and persuade the City to invest.'
Aitken-Davies can claim practical, daily experience of the railway,
commuting from Raynes Park in south west London to Waterloo. He is also a
regular user of BR's InterCity services.
He stepped down from PowerGen in October intending to take a break from
business but the government's decision to bring forward Railtrack's
privatisation required a quick decision. He will join the company full-time
in January.
Aitken-Davies, a former councillor in the London Borough of Merton, devotes
some of his free time to acting as an external examiner in business studies
at Luton University.
