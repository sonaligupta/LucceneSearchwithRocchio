FT  28 SEP 94 / People: MTM ends its lengthy search


MTM, the chemicals company which almost collapsed two years ago, yesterday
ended more than a year of management uncertainty by naming a new chief
executive.
The group has recruited Donald Neil, managing director of Rocol - the
chemical products subsidiary of Morgan Crucible - to oversee a new
acquisition strategy aimed at establishing three or four core businesses in
sectors such as bio-technology, ceramics and instruments.
The appointment follows a six-month search for a replacement for Ken
Schofield, who stepped down in June last year after completing a rescue
restructuring.
Neil, 51, is expected to continue the reorganisation, which was dominated by
the disposal last year of most of MTM's assets to BTP, the fine chemical
company, for Pounds 100m, and the acquisition in March this year of Colin
Stewart Minchem, the Cheshire-based chemical company, for Pounds 11.8m.
'We've been described as leaderless, but that was unfair. We simply delayed
recruitment to ensure we had a new business capable of moving in the right
direction,' says David Swallow, chairman and acting chief executive, who
will now revert to being non-executive chairman.
Before moving to Rocol, Neil - a chartered chemist - was a director of
Manders, the coatings and inks business, and a divisional director at Croda
International, the chemicals group.
He was chosen from a short list of eight candidates and will receive a basic
annual salary of around Pounds 100,000 plus bonuses and share options.
