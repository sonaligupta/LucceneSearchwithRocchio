FT  10 JAN 92 / Rapid growth found among consultancies


   By ANDREW JACK


SMALL management consultancies and market researchers have been among the
fastest-growing businesses of the past few years, the conference heard
yesterday, Andrew Jack writes.
Mr John Bryson, of Cambridge University and the Small Business Research
Centre, said increasing specialisation of production and the growing
international complexity of operations had boosted prospects for
information-intensive businesses.
The number of management consultancies created grew 114 per cent from 1985
to 1990 while the number of all companies grew 3.5 per cent. The number of
market research companies doubled between 1980 and 1990. Only draughting and
computer science companies grew more quickly.
Mr Bryson analysed 120 consultancy and market research companies in London,
the south-east and the north of England.
The average company had 6.5 staff and most were founded by people deciding
to start their own business rather than by those made redundant.
More than 70 per cent had large companies as clients and two-thirds of their
work came from repeat business. Much work was also derived from personal
contacts.
Two-fifths of their work came from manufacturing clients and 20 per cent
from other business services. About 70 per cent of sales came from beyond 20
miles of the business's location.
Only three of 159 companies contacted for interview had closed in 1990 and
1991. Mr Bryson said most had survived the recession by reducing the amount
of work handed to sub-contractors.
