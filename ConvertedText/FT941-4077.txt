FT  12 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: CGT and indexation . . . - In this,
the second of a series on capital gains tax, Richard Chant and Alan Sugden
deal with indexation and how to match sales of a security with purchases
made at different times after March 31 1982


   By RICHARD CHANT and ALAN SUGDEN


The purpose of indexation
In order to avoid charging CGT on that element of a realised gain caused by
inflation since March 1982, the cost of securities acquired after March 31
of that year is indexed by the change in the retail price index from the
month of purchase or acquisition to the month of disposal.
(Note that the month of purchase is the month of the contract's date, not
the settlement date).
Calculation of indexation using factors
The Inland Revenue issues a monthly table of indexation factors. These apply
to the original cost of a holding sold in that month.
For example, its January 1994 table (not shown here) gave a factor of 0.665
for June 1983. Thus, if shares bought for Pounds 1,000 in June 1983 were
sold in January 1994, the calculation needed to work out the indexed cost
would be: Pounds 1,000 + (Pounds 1,000 x 0.665) Pounds 665 = Pounds 1,665.
An alternative and simpler indexation tool is provided in Table 1. By adding
1 to all the factors published by the Revenue, the FT allows you to cut the
calculation down.
Simply multiply the original cost by the adjusted factor: ie, 1.665. So,
Pounds 1,000 x 1.665 = Pounds 1,665.
Where to find the factors
A table of adjusted CGT indexation allowances is published each month -
usually on the last Saturday - in the Weekend FT. These cover allowances for
the previous month. Those for January 1994 were published on February 26.
(See Table 1).
Calculation of indexation factors
The indexation factor is calculated like this. Take the retail price index
(RPI) in the month of disposal and subtract the RPI in March 1982 (or the
actual month acquired, if later). Divide the resulting figure by the RPI in
March 1982 (or the actual month acquired, if later).
Here, for example, is how to work out the factor for the sale of an asset
acquired in June 1983 and sold in January 1994, using the RPIs from Table 2:
RPI January 1994 - RPI June 1983 / RPI June 1983 gives you (141.3 - 84.8)
56.5 / 84.8 = 0.66627. Rounded to the nearest third decimal place, this
would give 0.666.
The difference between this and the published factor of 0.665 is due to the
published RPI figures being themselves rounded.
Calculation of indexation using RPI
Alternatively, you can use the monthly RPIs, which are produced by the
government statistical service and published widely in the financial press.
Each year, for instance, Accountancy magazine produces a complete table of
RPIs going back to 1915, and this is updated each month in the FT table.
(See Table 2).
In our example above, taking the RPIs for June 1983 (84.8) and January 1994
(141.3) from Table 2, the calculation is quite simple. The indexed cost =
original cost x RPI for the month of sale / RPI for the month of purchase -
or Pounds 1,000 x 141.3 / 84.8 = Pounds 1,666.
Either method (factor or RPI) is acceptable to the Inland Revenue providing
it is consistent. In other words, you must stick to one method all the time.
A great advantage of using the RPI is that you need only one table of RPIs
rather than a factor table for each month.
What happens when the RPI is static or falling
If the RPI for the month of disposal is the same or less than the RPI for
the month of acquisition (or the RPI for March 1982 if acquired pre-March 31
1982), then indexation would be nil. (That is, there is no 'negative
indexation' if the RPI falls).
Share pooling for stock acquired after April 5 1982
Where you add to your existing holding of a security, and all your previous
purchases have been later than April 5 1982, your total holding of that
security is treated as a single asset. If you dispose of part of your
holding, the disposal is treated as a partial disposal.
Ignoring indexation for the moment, let us consider a shareholder who
invests in the ordinary 10p shares of Stakis, the Scottish-based hotel group
(see Table 3).
Stakis fell on hard times due to rapid and imprudent expansion, sometimes
into activities unrelated to its main business; it even acquired a
stockbroking firm, Robert Wigram & Co., in September 1987, the month before
the market crashed. It took a change of management, the disposal of
peripheral activities and a one-for-three 'rescue' rights issue to turn the
company round.
Now let us include indexation. Table 4 shows how:
1. The cost of the original holding is indexed from the month of the
original purchase to the month of the rights issue.
2. The total cost is indexed to the month in which 4,000 shares were sold.
This is the method that Revenue legislation stipulates; a re-calculation of
the indexed cost should be made every time an 'operative event' occurs. An
operative event is any event which either increases or reduces the cost of a
holding.
This is fine if you are programming the calculation for a computer, but not
if you are a small private shareholder working it out by hand. In this case,
you can simplify the process by doing the calculation only when a disposal
takes place.
First, you either index the original cost to the date of this disposal; or,
if there has been a prior disposal from the holding, index the indexed cost
of the residual holding at the date of the last disposal to the date of this
disposal.
Then, you index the cost of each subsequent purchase from the date of
acquisition to the date of this disposal.
In our Stakis shareholder example, the shareholder has made no previous
disposals (see Table 5). We will deal with the treatment of securities
acquired before March 31 1982 in our next article.
Proposed changes to the rules on indexation
In his November Budget, the chancellor announced that for disposals made on
or after November 30 (the day after the Budget), indexation would be allowed
only to reduce or eliminate a capital gain. That is, it cannot be used to
create or increase a loss. In addition, as we mentioned last week, the
indexation of the cost of holdings of negligible value is ruled out for
negligible-value claims made after November 29, even if the Revenue had
deemed them to be of negligible value before then.
These proposals are contained in the Finance Bill now going through
Parliament and are not expected to be altered.
Payment for shares by instalment - acquisition date
If you subscribe for an issue of shares and pay for them by instalments,
indexation of their cost is calculated as follows:
1. For privatisation issues: from the date you acquire the shares.
2. For other issues: (a) If all instalments are payable within a 12-month
period, from the date by which the first payment has to be made; (b) If
payments are spread over more than 12 months, from the date by which each
instalment had to be paid.
