FT  16 JAN 92 / Beales Hunter pounds 5.1m cash call


Beales Hunter, the Nottingham-based textile, refrigeration and electrical
group, is launching a rights issue to raise about pounds 5.08m net to fund
two acquisitions and eliminate gearing.
At the same time the company announced a small rise in pre-tax profits to
pounds 1.2m (pounds 1.11m) in the half-year to November 30. The interim
dividend is lifted 0.1p to 2.3p.
Some 2.42m new ordinary shares at 220p apiece will be issued on a
one-for-three basis.
The companies to be acquired are Ingram Electronic Services - for an initial
pounds 600,000 and a further consideration up to a maximum of pounds 1m -
and Tyne Tees Forth Air Conditioning & Refigeration for about pounds
600,000.
Gateshead-based Tyne Tees is a subsidiary of NSM and follows February's
pounds 1.75m acquisition of Rock Refrigeration, Seward Refrigeration
Supplies and Telewig (UK). In the year to March 1991 Tyne Tees made profits,
before non-recurring items and tax, of pounds 180,000. Net assets were then
pounds 142,000.
Ingram, an electronic components manufacturer based in Airdrie, Scotland,
made pounds 107,000 pre-tax in the year to March 31 and had net assets of
about pounds 192,000.
Turnover at Beales Hunter amounted to pounds 20.8m (pounds 19.1m) in the
half-year to end November, with operating profits up at pounds 1.39m (pounds
1.29m). However, after the issue of almost 1m new shares in February's open
offer, earnings slipped to 12.4p (13.2p) per share.
