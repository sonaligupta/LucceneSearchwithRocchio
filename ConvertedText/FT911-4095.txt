FT  20 APR 91 / Finance & The Family: TR takes a new tack - The Fund
Managers


   By PHILIP COGGAN


THE LATE 1980s was a very difficult period for Touche Remnant. A number of
its investment trusts came under predatory attack, speculation raged about
the future ownership of the management group and there was a shake-up among
its of senior executives.
Now, under the ownership of Societe Generale, the company is trying to
settle down and establish itself once again as one of Britain's premier fund
management groups.
In March, the group announced that the unit trust, private client and
international businesses were being separately organised and re-branded. The
idea was to take advantage of the international links of Societe Generale
and the new company will be named SGTR (UK). The unit trust arm is also
understood to be about to announce the appointment of a new managing
director.
The unit trust group is only a relatively small element of TR's portfolio,
consisting of only one-ninth of total funds under management at the end of
1990.
Although the open-ended funds only emerged from the unitisation of the old
Cedar Investment Trust, TR has managed a more than respectable investment
performance. Five of the 12 trusts with a three year record are in the top
quartile (highest 25 per cent) in their sector. Over seven years, four out
of seven funds are in the top 25 per cent.
The European Special Situations trust is the largest in the stable, at
around Pounds 57m, having risen to sixth in its sector over three years. Its
shorter term performance is less impressive, placing it 75th out of 119
funds over one year.
Stephen Peak, the manager, says that he was successful with his stock
selection in the early years of the trust. But in spite of some good
geographical asset allocation decisions, (for example, being underweight in
Germany), the fund was hit by a market preference for more mainline stocks
last year.
The General Growth trust is seventh in its sector over seven years and is a
first quartile performer over three years. Job Curtis, manager of the trust,
says it was heavily invested in smaller and medium companies up to 1987, but
then switched into larger companies at what turned out to be the right
moment.
Paul Manduca, TR's chief executive, says that although the group has an
investment policy committee, it still gives a reasonable degree of latitude
to the specialist fund managers. 'An over-controlled fund manager can
sometimes be demoralised' he says.
Investment trusts still form the bulk of the group's funds under management,
although they are much reduced by the impact of the predatory raids of the
late 1980s. The 'most unkindest cut of all' was the disappearance of TR
Industrial and General, the group's flagship trust, which was taken over by
the British Coal pension fund in 1988.
Previously a whole series of trusts, TR Pacific Basin, TR America, TR
Technology and TR Pacific Basin had been subject to bids or reorganisation.
Since the trusts collectively owned the management group, the series of
attacks heightened speculation over TR's future. Failed discussions with
Metropolitan Life about an offer and the departure of some top management
did not help.
Now that the ownership issue is settled, TR's still extensive roster of
investment trusts can be brought back into focus. Here again there are some
good performances.
The Bankers Trust is second in its sector - International General - over
five and 10 years, according to Micropal. TR City of London is first in the
UK income growth sector over three and five years and second over 10 years.
Touche Remnant reports high demand from older private investors for TR City
of London and another income trust, TR High Income, which attracted a lot of
funds through Personal Equity Plans (PEPs). Shares in TR High Income
currently stand at a premium to net assets, a sign of strong investor
demand.
John Korwin-Szymanowski, investment trust analyst at S G Warburg Securities,
says TR's investment trusts side is 'much improved and the group seems to
have fitted in well with Societe Generale's ownership.
Praise for the reshaped TR is not without qualifications. Fund Research, in
a recent report on the group, says the product range, currently under
review, 'lacks balance and in some cases focus or logic'.
But Fund Research concludes that 'TR is a fascinating group, in the midst of
major strategic reorganisation, but with the capital backing, leadership and
motivation to expand; overall, one which appears certain to be able to meet
the challenges of global markets in the years ahead.'
