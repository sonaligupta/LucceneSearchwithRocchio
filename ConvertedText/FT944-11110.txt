FT  08 NOV 94 / Women 'likely to take most new jobs'


   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Employment Editor


Unemployment will stay above 2m in Britain until at least 2001 in spite of a
projected 1m extra jobs, says the review of the economy and employment
published today by the Institute for Employment Research at Warwick
University.
The report suggests that the bulk of new employment will come from 'cyclical
recovery rather than long-term growth'. Male full-time jobs are expected to
decline, with most additional employment going to women, the majority of
whom will be working part-time.
The study forecasts an annual improvement of 3.3 per cent in industrial
output from 1993 to 1997, the best performance in the economy for 40 years,
with a 2.7 per cent growth in output per person.
The institute says: 'Some further reductions in unemployment are expected as
the economy picks up but these are not likely to be dramatic.'
It says Britain's labour force should rise steadily until the end of the
decade, partly owing to the increase in the number of women between the ages
of 25 and 50 in employment.
The number of plant and machine operatives is expected to fall by more than
100,000 by 2001.
