FT  24 AUG 92 / Gaidar adviser tells of oil price mistake


   By MARTIN WOLF


WITH the mass privatisation programme announced last week by President Boris
Yeltsin, Russian reform was now taking its 'second step', after earlier
price liberalisation, Mr Sergei Vasiliev, an economic adviser to Mr Yegor
Gaidar, acting prime minister of Russia, has argued in London.
But the government had made its first mistake by not liberalising oil and
energy prices in April, he admitted. As a result, oil exports had been
falling, and wasteful use of energy continued and administrative controls on
oil exports had had to be kept. Failure to liberalise also led to three
months' stagnation in the reforms, while the opposition (mainly former
communists) gathered strength.
Mr Vasiliev was announcing the appearance of a new quarterly journal,
Russian Economic Trends, an English-language publication of the Russian
government*. Apart from the latest statistics, it sets out the government's
economic strategy and analysis of economic developments.
Western aid could not solve the problems of so large a country as Russia,
but western barriers to exports of high-technology products, textiles and
agricultural products were an important obstacle to Russia's ability to
exploit its long-term comparative advantage in trade.
The government was still unable to control the budget deficit, Mr Vasiliev
added. But such control was a necessary condition for a fixed exchange rate,
needed to provide the environment desired by foreign investors.
