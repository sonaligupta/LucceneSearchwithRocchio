FT  25 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Ex-Invesco MIM director gets Pounds 460,000
pay-off


   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent


Invesco MIM, the UK-based fund management company, paid its former deputy
chairman, Mr Nicholas Johnson, Pounds 460,000 following his resignation from
the board at the end of last year.
Details of Mr Johnson's severance are contained in the company's 1992 annual
report which is to be published tomorrow.
About half the pay-off consists of pension payments and enhancements. The
other half is the remainder owing under Mr Johnson's one-year service
contract.
Invesco MIM is under investigation by Imro, the self-regulatory body for the
fund management industry, for its role as a fund manager for the former
Maxwell company pension schemes and for other unspecified matters.
