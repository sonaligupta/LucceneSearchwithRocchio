FT  23 JUL 94 / US silent over Syria peace initiative


   By MARK NICHOLSON and REUTER


   CAIRO, JERUSALEM


Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, yesterday completed his third
Middle East shuttle this year, apparently without achieving a breakthrough,
but promised to return to the region soon.
He declined to reveal the substance of talks he held yesterday with
President Hafez al-Assad, the Syrian leader in Damascus. A Syrian government
spokesman said Mr Assad had 'listened to ideas' Mr Christopher had brought
from Israel on unlocking the impasse over the Golan Heights and had
'expressed readiness to discuss steps' to move the process forward.
As on previous visits to Damascus, neither Syrian nor US officials have
revealed the contents of what diplomats in the region believe are detailed,
but slow-moving negotiations between the two sides. Mr Christopher visited
Damascus twice during this week's initiative, which coincided with detailed
negotiations on border, water and security issues between Israel and Jordan.
Meanwhile, King Hussein of Jordan yesterday left Amman for Washington where
he is set to hold his first public meeting with Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's
prime minister, at the White House on Monday. The summit will symbolise
accelerated progress in Israeli-Jordanian talks.
Israel for the second time this week yesterday barred a member of the
Palestinian self-rule administration from entering Jerusalem, the Israeli
army said, Reuter adds from Jerusalem.
An army spokeswoman said Mr Mohammed Zuhdi al-Nashashibi, who holds the
finance portfolio in the Palestinian Authority in Gaza and Jericho, was
stopped as he tried to drive into Jerusalem from the Jericho self-rule
enclave. 'He (Nashashibi) wanted to enter Jerusalem from Jericho but he
didn't have permission so was told to go back,' she said.
