FT  07 MAR 94 / British Steel to seek pledge on industry support


   By HUGO DIXON


British Steel has proposed that European industry ministers make a solemn
pledge at their next meeting in April not to sanction any further subsidies
in the steel industry as a way of resolving the sector's crisis, writes Hugo
Dixon.
Mr Brian Moffat, British Steel's chairman, said he would then be prepared to
take part in an industry-wide restructuring scheme being brokered by the
European Commission. British Steel and other private-sector steel groups
have been refusing to take part in the scheme following the decision by
industry ministers to approve Ecu7bn (Pounds 5.3bn) in aid to several
state-owned steel groups last December.
The scheme envisages non-aided companies cutting up to 25m tonnes of
capacity to bring demand and supply for steel into balance. Mr Moffat vowed
to continue his boycott of the scheme if there was no pledge to curb future
subsidies. He said that without such assurance, he would also not attend a
meeting between the Commission and European steel chiefs scheduled for March
23.
British Steel accepts that it will be impossible to unravel December's deal
on subsidies. But it is trying to build up support for a total ban on any
more being granted.
