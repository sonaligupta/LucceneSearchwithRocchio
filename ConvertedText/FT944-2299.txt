FT  16 DEC 94 / International Company News: Venezuela plans Dollars 1bn in
oil-backed bonds

The Venezuelan government has been in talks with international investment
banks over the possibility of next year issuing up to Dollars 1bn of bonds
collateralised by oil revenues in the international market.
Mr Julio Sosa, finance minister, said yesterday the idea was to issue the
first of the bonds - some Dollars 250m worth - in the first quarter of next
year.
Six investment banks were 'very interested' in the plans. 'If we are
successful we will place up to Dollars 1bn,' he said.
The government plans to use the funds to repay some of its Dollars 9bn in
non-restructured foreign debt in order to avoid a bunching of debt
repayments in 1996, 1997 and 1998.
The debt to be repaid would be mostly bilateral debt owed to other
governments, some of which has been in arrears and which amounts to some
Dollars 5bn.
The government has separate plans to issue dollar-denominated paper in the
domestic market, also to be collateralised by oil royalties and likely to
carry a seven-year term and 10 per cent coupon.
This week, the government began issuing two-year paper in local currency in
a bid to mop up the liquidity washing around the economy following this
year's banking crisis.
The aim is to issue up to 160bn bolivars (Dollars 940m) of this paper. The
government has temporarily stopped the central bank from issuing 90-day
zero-coupon notes in a bid to encourage banks to buy the two-year notes.
