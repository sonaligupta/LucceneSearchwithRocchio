FT  05 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Linton to take rest of Assoc Fisheries


   By PAUL TAYLOR


LINTON PARK, the diversified tea and coffee producer and food trader, plans
to take full control of Associated Fisheries, its 75.1 per cent quoted
subsidiary, through a merger under a scheme of arrangement which values the
fishing, food processing and transport group at about Pounds 21m.
The ultimate parent of both companies is Camellia, a quoted investment
company with interests ranging from fine art to tea plantations, which holds
a 68.2 per cent interest in Linton through the Lawrie Group.
Linton said it was offering one of its own shares and 70p cash for every two
shares in Associated Fisheries in an agreed deal which values the company's
shares at 135p each compared with 124p at Tuesday's close.
In their joint announcement the two companies said the terms of the merger
represented increases of 9.3 per cent in capital value and 15 per cent in
income for Fisheries' ordinary shareholders.
The merger has been approved by Fisheries' independent directors.
Linton has been a shareholder in the company for 20 years and acquired a
controlling interest in 1987. As a result the companies said they had become
'increasingly close in the pursuance of mutual commercial interests.'
Among other reasons given for the merger the boards of the two companies
said the deal would provide the opportunity for cost savings and give
Fisheries' minority shareholders the opportunity to participate in a group
with wider product and geographic diversity.
The directors argued this would enable Fisheries' shareholders to benefit
from more broadly based earnings which would be less reliant on the results
of one main division.
In 1992 Linton reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.66m compared with a
Pounds 1.16m restated loss.
Associated Fisheries yesterday also reported a 35 per cent increase in
interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.8m (Pounds 1.33m) for the six months to
June 30.
Earnings per share rose to from 5.53p to 7.98p and the interim dividend is
lifted to 1.25p (1p).
Turnover increased to Pounds 42.4m (Pounds 40.2m).
