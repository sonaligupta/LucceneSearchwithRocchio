FT  30 OCT 93 / The Financial Times Guide To Secondary Education (1): State
schools close in on the top dogs - The results of the FT's unique survey


   By GILLIAN DE BONO and JOHN AUTHERS


INDEPENDENT schools dominate the top of this year's FT survey of 1,000
schools, holding 92 of the first 100 positions. But the challenge from the
state sector is gathering momentum.
In last year's FT-1000 only three state schools earned a place in the top
200. This year the figure is 23. Last year the top state school was ranked
63rd, but this year's top state school, Colchester County Girls High in
Essex, is ranked 37th.
So while there is reassurance for fee-paying parents who, on average, pay
Pounds 36,200 for one child's secondary education at a private day school,
or Pounds 65,800 at a boarding school, in some areas the state sector offers
an alternative which cannot be ignored.
Essex is blessed with two other high-flying state grammar schools,
Chelmsford County High (78) and King Edward VI (81), both of which outshine
the county's best independent schools. Buckinghamshire, which also retained
grammar schools in several areas, and Kent also have excellent state school
records.
Placing schools as precisely as this is a difficult and controversial job,
which the FT has done as fairly as possible. The FT - 1,000 is the result of
six months' research. Questionnaires were sent to the 1,100 top performing
state schools according to last year's government statistics. These
represent one third of state schools teaching A-levels.
In addition, the Independent Schools' Information Service (ISIS) supplied
compatible data on over 500 (the majority) of its members. Before the tables
were completed, head teachers were sent checking sheets to enable them to
verify their entry and amend A-level grades where necessary.
All schools with at least 10 A-level candidates are included in our table.
As most parents choose a school within 10 miles of home, they are listed
alphabetically within counties, to show local choices at a glance.
Unlike league tables that assess schools only on the performance of their
best pupils by ranking them according to the percentage of A and B grades,
the FT-1000 compares the results of all A-level candidates using the points
system of the Universities Central Council of Admissions (UCCA).
The FT-1000 rank positions represent a weighting of the average number of
UCCA points achieved per pupil (the quantity of grades attained) with the
average number of UCCA points per subject entry (the quality of grades
attained).
However, rank positions can exaggerate differences between schools,
particularly between middle ranking schools. Although there are marked
disparities between schools at the top and bottom ends of the league table,
schools ranked between 280 and 630 all achieved results within 10 per cent
of the average - equivalent to each pupil achieving three grade Cs.
For this reason, the FT score is an important corrective to rankings. It has
been scaled so that a score of 1.00 represents the average performance of
all the schools in the FT-1000. The table opposite enables you to convert FT
scores into average A-level grades attained.
It is not surprising that grammar schools, often more selective than
competing independents, lead the state sector. For example, 17 Kent grammar
schools achieved an FT score greater than 1.00, equivalent to average
A-level grades of between BBC and CCC.
Yet in spite of their wide ability intake, many comprehensives achieved
impressive results. Three took places in our top 200 - Hasmonean High in
Hendon (ranked 73rd), Dame Alice Owen's School in Potters Bar, Hertfordshire
(ranked 131), and Cherwell in Oxford (ranked 185). Of the 315 included in
the FT-1000, 135 came within 10 per cent of the average FT score - the
equivalent of at least three grade Cs per pupil.
Overall, opted-out comprehensives achieved similar results to local
authority comprehensives. But for grammar schools, opted-out schools
out-scored those staying with the local authority with average FT scores of
1.05 against 0.99. This may for the moment reflect the fact that successful
schools are more likely to take the risk of opting out, but this trend must
be monitored carefully.
Parents keen on independent day schools can be cheered by the fact that 78
out of the top 100 charge annual fees below the average of Pounds 5,170.
Those contemplating boarding schools are less fortunate. With a few
exceptions, the FT-1000 reveals that you have to pay a premium for
exceptional results. Eighty five out of the top 100 independent boarding
schools charge above average fees (Pounds 9,400 a year).
Nor are academic returns so rewarding. Although two of the most prestigious
 -Winchester and Eton - remain anchored in the top 10, boarding school
pupils achieved less impressive results than those at independent day
schools, achieving average FT scores of 1.04, rather than 1.08.
This means that Winchester, Eton and the girls' school Wycombe Abbey manage
to appear in the top 10 of the FT's rough and ready value-for money tables
(see page 4), in spite of high annual fees of Pounds 12,270, Pounds 11,934
and Pounds 11,538.
The boarding schools' problem could stem from the 6 per cent fall in rolls
which they suffered last year.
As a result of the recession, boarding schools now receive fewer applicants
and must be less selective.
State schools with boarding facilities should not be overlooked. Several
achieve impressive results, including the Royal Grammar, High Wycombe
(66th), Reading (177th) and the Royal Grammar, Lancaster (189th). Fees
average Pounds 4,000. They can be identified by the Boarding % column in our
main table.
Comparisons of A-level results around the country with average house prices
make startling reading. With the exception of Greater London and
Oxfordshire, the 10 best performing counties have below average house
prices.
In Leicestershire, fourth in the country, the average house price is Pounds
49,250 - 22 per cent lower than the national average. Fees for
Leicestershire independent schools are also slightly below average.
Single-sex schools achieved better results than fully mixed schools in both
the state and independent sectors. The FT scores for single sex schools are
identical for boys and girls (1.09 in independents and 1.04 in grammar
schools), whereas mixed independent schools averaged 1.01, with grammar
schools on 0.95.
The strong showing for single-sex schools still leaves plenty of room for
controversy. None of the top 20 schools is mixed throughout its age range,
and the recent decision by a mixed state school in Essex to segregate boys
and girls for classes shows that the idea is gaining in favour.
However, these figures demonstrate only the academic impact of single-sex
status and say nothing about the broader effects on a child's upbringing.
John Sugden, head of Leicester Grammar, the top co-educational school at
number 29 in the rankings, says the strength of single-sex schools is a
historical coincidence. He points out that that most well-off selective city
schools happen to be single-sex. Leicester Grammar is already approaching
the very best results in spite of being co-educational because it is
selective. Boys' school heads tend to agree.
Girls' schools, however, take a different approach, and plainly believe that
single-sex education is vital for their pupils. Joan Clanchy, headmistress
of North London Collegiate, is not given to understatement: 'Girls are
actually cleverer than boys. So if you have got a school full of girls, you
will do better.'
In other words, the figures may just say something about the relative
development of the two sexes. Research suggests that at the age of 16 girls
are more mature and intellectually advanced than boys.
The issue is less clear at A-level where the boy's half of 'twin' schools
such as Haberdashers' Aske's, Elstree, St Paul's, and King Edward's,
Birmingham, tend to do slightly better.
The strongest criticism of school league tables is that no allowance is made
for schools' selection policies at age 11 or 13. Nor do they take into
account socio-economic variations in catchment areas.
Ian Mellor of Sir Roger Manwood's grammar school in Sandwich, Kent (ranked
330) speaks for many: 'The hoary old argument that it is easier for a
suburban grammar school to produce results of a high order than it is for a
school in a deprived city area is so obvious as to make comparison between
the two types futile. Even grammar schools cannot readily be compared, since
they have different catchments. My area takes about the top 25 per cent of
applicants, whereas others take anything from 10 to 40 per cent.'
Sceptics can further point to the catchment areas of the top comprehensives
 -for example Hasmonean High serves the Jewish community of North London,
and Cherwell is in North Oxford, home to most of the university's dons.
Schools with a selective sixth form also have an advantage, as the deputy
head of St Martin's comprehensive in Brentwood (640th) said: 'We have a
policy of entering all pupils with a chance of passing, however slim. We
could produce impressive statistics by changing this policy to the detriment
of our students.'
Alex Clarke, head of Poole Grammar, Dorset, also made the point that A-level
results do not always reflect the achievements of a school's original
intake: 'Although we are a selective school at 12-plus, about 40 per cent of
our A-level candidates join us at 16-plus where our entry requirements for
A-level are similar to most schools.'
These problems explain why the government is looking for ways of measuring
'value added', or the extent to which pupils improve while they are at a
school, rather than printing raw exam results.
This year, as last, the FT-1000 has excluded general studies A-level in its
calculations. Roger Dancey, headteacher of King Edward VI Camp Hill School
for Boys in Birmingham (ranked 103) was one of many who insisted on its
value: '50,000 Joint Matriculation Board candidates should not be ignored.
General studies is an excellent predictor for higher education.'
But the weight of educational opinion is against them. Earlier this year the
Engineering Council published a report written by Alan Smithers, professor
of education at Manchester university, which said that general studies
counted for little in the competition for university places and had failed
to broaden the curriculum. Some pupils even revised for it by playing the
board game Trivial Pursuit.
Other heads lamented the omission of a five year FT score - a feature of
last year's survey - pointing out that A-level results can vary considerably
from year to year, especially for schools with small sixth forms.
Unfortunately, so many state schools were unwilling or unable to produce the
information last year that the five-year comparisons had to be abandoned
this year.
Nor do A-level league tables reflect the achievements of sixth-formers who
combine one or two A-levels with vocational courses, which are fast gaining
popularity with employers. Many excellent schools offer superb sixth form
vocational courses but will never excel in A-level league tables.
Other heads who may justifiably feel hard done by are those who run the
schools which entered fewer than 10 candidates for A-levels. Results for
these schools can be so volatile that it could be misleading to publish rank
orderings which include them, but some produced impressive results this
year.
In spite of these objections, all of which must be taken into account, these
tables still help parents to shortlist schools that might suit their child's
academic aptitude. And for all their protestations, schools cannot deny that
the tables have an impact.
Early in the morning of August 28 this year, the head of a boarding school
in Surrey was woken by one of his governors. A copy of the FT guide to
independent school A-level results was thrust into his hands.
The governor, chairman of the finance committee, had been awaiting the new
league tables with trepidation. The school was higher up in the tables, but
not by as much as had been hoped, and the head had to do something about it.
The head of the school in question has spent the last year attempting to
raise academic standards. While parents continue to want to read league
tables, he will continue to respond to them. If that means attempting to
improve academic standards, then the FT league table has achieved something.

Each independent school had its FT score divided by the annual day or
boarding fee. On this basis the schools above gave parents the best
academic return on their money - although bear in mind that the figures
used are crude, and no heavy weight should be attached to them. (The
figure in brackets shows a school's position in the main table.)
