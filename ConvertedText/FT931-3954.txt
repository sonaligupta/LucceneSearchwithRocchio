FT  12 MAR 93 / Cuts in Tube budget attacked


   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent


LONDON UNDERGROUND yesterday tried to embarrass the government over the
spending cuts imposed on it in last year's Autumn Statement by spelling out
the effects.
It wrote to 59 London MPs, 11 members of the European parliament, 31
boroughs, three county councils and four district councils naming 140
stations that would be adversely affected by cuts in its investment
programme.
In what appeared to be an attempt to position itself for an increased budget
in this year's spending round, it said the results of last year's investment
cut would include:
Cancellation or delays to improvements in passenger security - through help
points, closed-circuit television or better lighting - at 47 stations.
Proposals to alleviate congestion at 13 stations would be postponed.
Plans to refurbish 48 stations would not go ahead as quickly as planned.
Escalator replacement and refurbishment would be delayed at 18 stations.
Improvements to the 'largely antiquated and difficult-to-hear' passenger
information systems would be deferred at 57 stations.
The letters said other consequences of the spending cuts included:
Refurbishment of trains on the District, Piccadilly and Metropolitan lines
would be deferred.
The long-awaited start to the modernisation of the Northern Line would be
delayed until at least 1996.
The proposed extensions of the East London Line northwards to Highbury &
Islington and southwards to East Dulwich would be postponed to 1996-97 at
the earliest.
London Underground said the Autumn Statement had resulted in its investment
budget for 1993-94 being cut from Pounds 860m to Pounds 570m. In contrast,
investment in the roads programme was being increased, it said.
