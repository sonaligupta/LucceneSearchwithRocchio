FT  16 JAN 92 / The Lloyd's Report - News and Reaction: Parties divide on
reform proposals


   By RALPH ATKINS


LABOUR was dismissive yesterday of the task force report, but among Tory
MPs, many of whom are underwriting members, there was a cautious welcome.
Ms Marjorie Mowlam, Labour's voice on the City, said Lloyd's had had the
opportunity to take a 'decisive first step' in rehabilitating its
reputation. 'That opportunity has been missed,' she said.
Labour wants Lloyd's controlled under a regime similar to that applying to
other parts of the City under the 1986 Financial Services Act, including its
provisions for compensating investors. It opposes extra tax concessions to
help soothe losses such as proposed last year by some Tory MPs.
Ministers are privately concerned about Lloyd's future, particularly in
competing with other European financial centres, but believe its management
is an internal affair. Officially, the Department of Trade and Industry
would yesterday only welcome the extent of the task force's work.
Legislation needed to implement the report's proposals would probably be
undertaken under the private-bill procedure rather than as
government-sponsored business.
Tory MPs - of whom about 50, including cabinet ministers, are members - will
watch the reform proposals carefully. In spite of widespread concern at the
extent of recent losses, most accepted that unlimited liability had to
remain an integral part of Lloyd's There was broad support, however, for the
proposed compulsory 'stop loss' scheme.
Sir Michael Grylls, chairman of the Tory backbench trade and industry
committee, said the chairman of Lloyds might be called to explain the
reforms.
Mr Ian Taylor, Tory MP for Esher, said: 'I welcome any proposals which would
lead to a return of confidence for people staying, or becoming, Lloyd's
members. Whether these proposals go far enough will need to be carefully
considered.'
