FT  12 MAR 93 / International Company News: Trelleborg plunges into deficit


   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES


TRELLEBORG, the Swedish mining and industrial group, yesterday blamed the
recession, falling metal prices and foreign exchange losses for a SKr1.6bn
(Dollars 210m) loss after financial items in 1992.
The result represents a sharp turnaround from the SKr475m profit which the
group reported in 1991. The group has scrapped its dividend for 1992. In
1991 the group paid a dividend of SKr6.50 per share.
Foreign currency losses totalling SKr765m following the devaluation of the
Swedish krona played a large part in the deterioration of the group's
performance, and restructuring costs amounted to a further SKr210m.
But business conditions in core areas were difficult, and it suffered
additional costs because of inventory write-downs and production stoppages
over holiday periods.
Operating income rose to SKr23.5bn from SKr21.9bn, reflecting the
consolidation of Munskjo from the start of 1992, while the operating result
before depreciation amounted to SKr1.10bn, compared with SKr1.12bn. The loss
per share amounted to SKr21.80, after income of SKr5.10 in 1991.
Trelleborg's industry operations recorded an operating profit of SKr287m,
against SKr290m, as turnover climbed to SKr10.5bn from SKr7.7bn.
