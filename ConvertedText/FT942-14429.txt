FT  20 APR 94 / International Company News: Creditable quarter for US banks


   By PATRICK HARVERSON


   NEW YORK


Three large US banks reported growth in first-quarter earnings yesterday,
confirming that the industry performed creditably between January and March
in spite of the deterioration in the interest rate and trading environ-ment.
Topping the list was Chemical Banking, the nation's third largest bank,
which posted a 16 per cent increase in profits to Dollars 319m. The results
included a Dollars 48m pre-tax restructuring charge relating to the closure
of 50 branches in the New York area.
Although the yield on Chemical's interest-earning assets declined -
primarily because of higher interest rates - the group's net interest income
was virtually unchanged at Dollars 1.14bn.
Non-interest revenues rose by Dollars 6m to Dollars 931m, as increased fees
from corporate finance, revolving credit and asset management activities
offset a 27 per cent drop in trading revenues to Dollars 185m.
Chemical said results from the trading of securities, currencies and risk
management products were mixed, but, like most of the industry, its emerging
markets trading business performed poorly.
Banc One, the eighth-largest US bank, reported profits of Dollars 313m, up
from Dollars 287m a year earlier.
Growth in commercial and retail loans helped the bank post a modest increase
in net interest income to Dollars 1.06bn.
Once again, Banc One's use of interest rate swaps helped protect its margins
from rising interest-rates, but the positive contribution of swaps to the
net interest margin - which fell from 6.56 per cent a year ago to 6.14 per
cent in the quarter - declined.
Non-interest income at Banc One was Dollars 384m, up from Dollars 342m a
year earlier, as higher earnings from trust, securities and credit-card
securitisation business offset lower earnings from its insurance, investment
banking and merchant processing operations.
At Wells Fargo, the San Francisco-based bank, profits almost doubled to
Dollars 202m, up from Dollars 108m a year earlier, although the bulk of the
gain was attributable to a sharp decline in loan loss provisions, which fell
from Dollars 210m a year ago to Dollars 60m.
Net interest income slipped 5 per cent to Dollars 642m following a 34 basis
point drop in the bank's net interest margin to 5.56 per cent.
Loan balances, however, grew slightly in the quarter, the first increase
since 1990. Non-interest income rose 16 per cent to Dollars 200m.
