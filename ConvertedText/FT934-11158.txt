FT  02 NOV 93 / Queens Moat House shareholders consider legal action


   By PEGGY HOLLINGER


SHAREHOLDERS in Queens Moat Houses are considering legal action against
former directors and advisers, writes Peggy Hollinger. A lobby group formed
by Mr Denis Woodhams, a former QMH hotel manager, is seeking legal advice
following news that the heavily indebted company would have to complete a
severely dilutive debt for equity swap in order to survive. QMH owes more
than Pounds 1bn .
Mr Woodhams' action group aims to establish 'the reasons for the decline of
the company, whether any persons or body can be held responsible for the
losses, and the likelihood of successfully obtaining compensation'.
Mr Peter Bruton-Phillips, the solicitor who, with consultant Mr Michael
Harkavy, of Alvechurch, Worcester, is representing shareholders' interests,
said yesterday there were very important issues to be investigated.
Meanwhile, the London Stock Exchange confirmed it was investigating alleged
breaches of the Companies Act.
