FT  05 AUG 93 / UK Company News: ECC completes Amps redemption


English China Clays has redeemed the last Dollars 50m (Pounds 33.5m) of its
auction market preference shares.
The group redeemed Dollars 350m of Amps last year following a Pounds 209m
rights issue in February 1992. In June this year it raised another Pounds
113.4m through a second rights issue and said it would redeem the remaining
Amps.
ECC was one of the first UK companies to issue the securities, which are
counted as equity, although having some characteristics of debt. Sentiment
has turned against the securities, though, and the group has joined some
other issuers in redeeming them.
