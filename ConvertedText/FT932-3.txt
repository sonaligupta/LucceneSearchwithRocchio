FT  30 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Debenham Tewson advances to Pounds 2.9m


   By PETER PEARSE


DEBENHAM TEWSON & Chinnocks, the quoted property adviser which merged with
Bernard Thorpe, a firm of chartered surveyors, in a deal worth Pounds 10.9m
in February, yesterday reported a rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.59m
to Pounds 2.86m for the year to April 30.
Mr Richard Lay, chairman, said that Thorpe's 10-week contribution coincided
with its 'historical heavy weighting of profitability' in its final quarter.
Of the enlarged group's operating profits of Pounds 3.1m (Pounds 1.68m),
Pounds 2.06m came from DTC and Pounds 1.05m from Thorpe. Mr Lay said that
Thorpe's contribution represented virtually its whole year's profits. 'In
that respect, we timed the merger well,' he said.
DTC was strong in London and the south-east, he added, and Thorpe was very
strong in the regions. That made the merger - known as DTZ Debenham Thorpe -
'one of the most significant advances in our industry in recent times', Mr
Lay said.
Group turnover of continuing businesses totalled Pounds 41m (Pounds 34.8m),
to which Thorpe pitched in Pounds 5.75m. Mr Lay said that 'after the most
appalling recession', there was now a change of mood.
A final dividend of 1.8p (1.5p) lifts the total to 3p (2.5p), payable from
earnings of 5.13p (2.76p).
