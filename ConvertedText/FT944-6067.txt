FT  30 NOV 94 / Palestinian credit for Dollars 58m agreed


   By REUTER


   PARIS


The World Bank has agreed to extend a Dollars 58m credit to Palestinian
authorities to support self-rule projects, an official at the multinational
institution said yesterday, Reuter reports from Paris.
Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) officials, in Brussels for meetings
with Israeli officials, the World Bank and wealthy donors, said there had
been an agreement.
The deal will be signed in Brussels today by Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO
chairman. Mr Arafat and Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, also in
Brussels, said they would put pressure on donors, who are to begin a two-day
meeting today, to pay out urgently money already promised to the
Palestinians.
The donors' last meeting broke down in a row over the Palestinians'
inclusion of Jerusalem in projects to be backed.
Palestinians consider Arab East Jerusalem the capital of a future state, but
Israel says that East and West Jerusalem are united and remain its 'eternal
capital'.
In October last year, aid donors pledged more than Dollars 2bn over five
years for projects to support Palestinian self-rule, with Dollars 700m to be
paid out this year. Mr Arafat said only about Dollars 60m in credits had so
far been received because some countries had not honoured their promises.
