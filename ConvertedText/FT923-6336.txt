FT  25 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Beauford cuts loss to Pounds 218,000


BEAUFORD, a designer and manufacturer of material handling equipment and
machine tools, reported a reduced loss before tax of Pounds 218,000 for the
six months to June 30.
That compared with a deficit of Pounds 240,000 in the first half of the
previous year and with losses of Pounds 1.86m in the second six months.
Turnover was Pounds 21.3m (Pounds 26.5m).
The company also announced that it was proposing to sell its 51 per cent
stake in Bliss, the loss-making metal forming machine manufacturer, for an
aggregate cash consideration of Pounds 628,116 to a new company established
for this purpose.
The disposal follows the sale in May of Kamat, another loss-making company.
Proceeds of the disposals will be used to reduce borrowings which will fall
to about Pounds 13.3m against Pounds 17.5m at the December year end.
Losses per share emerged at 7.6p (6.9p). The interim dividend is omitted
(1.85p).
