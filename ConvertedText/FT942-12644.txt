FT  28 APR 94 / International Company News: Bayer rises 18% to DM755m

Bayer yesterday became the second of Germany's big three chemicals groups to
report a robust increase in profits for the first quarter of this year.
The group said pre-tax profits rose by 18 per cent to DM755m (Dollars 444m)
in the three months ended March, reflecting the impact of extensive
cost-cutting measures and an increase in all business sectors.
The results follow Hoechst's 16 per cent increase in first-quarter pre-tax
profits, announced on Tuesday. Figures from BASF, due today, are likely to
reinforce the impression that recovery is firmly under way in the European
chemicals industry.
Bayer confirmed its earlier forecast that profits for 1994 would rise by 15
per cent to 20 per cent. Last year, pre-tax profits fell 12.6 per cent to
DM2.35bn.
Group sales in the first quarter rose by 6 per cent to DM11bn, mainly
because of a 5 per cent increase in volume sales.
Exchange rate movements contributed 3 per cent of the increase. Together
these factors offset a 2 per cent fall in selling prices.
Bayer explained that while sales were little changed in Germany, marked
growth in Italy, the UK and the Benelux countries offset the downward trend
in France and Spain. Sales in Europe rose 2 per cent to DM6.6bn and by 9 per
cent in the US to DM2.5bn.
There was a 22 per cent increase in sales in Asia, half of which was due to
the increase in the value of the yen.
