FT  21 NOV 92 / International Company News: Job cuts and Dollars 425m charge
at Monsanto

   NEW YORK


MONSANTO, the US chemicals group, yesterday disclosed an extraordinary
after-tax charge of Dollars 425m, or about Dollars 3.45 a share, against
fourth-quarter earnings and substantial job cuts at its Searle
pharmaceuticals division.
Its shares rose Dollars 2 to Dollars 57 3/8 in afternoon trading after
initially being halted on the news. The price has fallen from a high of
Dollars 71 1/4 in the last 52 weeks, largely reflecting concern about
Searle's performance.
Mr Richard Mahoney, chairman, said the company was responding to a fiercely
competitive environment, with consumers worldwide demand ing dramatically
lower prices for products and services.
'In our view, these conditions are a permanent shift in requirements rather
than simply a reflection of currently depressed economic conditions.'
The latest move follows Monsanto's Dollars 1.275bn sales of its Fischer
Controls valve and systems subsidiary in August and two large restructurings
in the 1980s.
Monsanto will cut about 3,200 jobs, mainly at Searle whose earnings have
been hurt by the patent loss of its important Calan drug earlier this year
and by the steep costs of bringing drugs to market. Its nine-month operating
income dropped to Dollars 23m from Dollars 84m last year, with operating
losses in this year's first half.
Searle is to sell and consoli date facilities, sell assets and reduce
marketing, administration and technical expenses.
Monsanto expects its cost-cutting measures to generate pre-tax savings of
Dollars 200m a year, starting in 1994.
