FT  29 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Colefax and Fowler dips as US margins
suffer


   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO


CONTINUING sluggish retail demand in the UK and a weak dollar kept first
half profits depressed at Colefax and Fowler Group, the wallpaper,
furnishings and fabric company.
Pre-tax profits in the six months to October 31 1991 fell from Pounds
815,000 to Pounds 505,000 in spite of turnover marginally ahead from Pounds
14.4m to Pounds 14.8m.
Mr David Green, chief executive, said margins had been particularly affected
in the US as a result of the weak dollar as most product was shipped from
Europe.
'We're not much of a price sensitive product but we decided to be reasonable
rather than greedy so that hurt margins a bit,' he said.
The group has not seen any signs of improvement in its principal markets and
does not expect to see a marked improvement in the near future.
Nevertheless, it maintained the interim dividend at 1.3p on earnings per
share down from 2.36p to 2p.
'One wants to give out a degree of confidence,' Mr Green said.
Efforts were being concentrated on cutting costs, although as Colefax was a
service company it was not able to cut employee levels dramatically.
Instead, it was focusing on tightening general controls such as stock
controls and debtor controls, Mr Green said.
