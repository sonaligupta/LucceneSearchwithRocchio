   TOKYO, WILMINGTON


FUJI Photo Film of Japan suffered a 10.4 per cent fall in consolidated
pre-tax profits to Y87bn (Dollars 681m) for the half-year to April due to
higher costs and increased competition.
Overall, sales rose 2.7 per cent to Y563.3bn. Operating profits, however,
declined 4.9 per cent to Y84.2bn due to a 6.3 per cent rise in sales costs
and a 19 per cent increase in research and development costs. After-tax
profits fell 16.9 per cent to Y40.2bn.
Fuji's non-operating profits plunged 67.6 per cent to Y2.7bn as a result of
a decline in interest and dividends received.
For the full year to October, Fuji forecast a 13.5 per cent fall in
after-tax profits to Y82bn on a 2 per cent rise in sales to Y1,140bn.
Du Pont Merck Pharmaceutical of the US and Banyu Pharmaceutical of Japan are
to form a new company in Japan to develop and market Du Pont Merck products
there, AP-DJ reports from Wilmington.
Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
Du Pont Merck said: 'Japan represents more than 20 per cent of the world
market for pharmaceuticals. In order to achieve our vision of being a
worldwide, research-based pharmaceutical company, we must participate in the
Japanese market.'
