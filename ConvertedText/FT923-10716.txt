FT  29 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Australian bank lifts net
profits to ADollars 45m

   SYDNEY, WELLINGTON


ADVANCE Bank Australia, building society turned bank, yesterday announced a
31 per cent increase in net profits to ADollars 45m (Dollars 33.5m) for the
year to May.
The board declared a final dividend of 24 cents, taking the total dividend
to 38 cents, compared with 29 cents in the previous year. The shares rose by
29 cents after the announcement to close at ADollars 5.20.
Mr James Service, chairman, said the 'highly satisfactory' outcome was
caused by strong residential lending and continuing efforts to reduce
operating costs.
He said expenses rose by only 4 per cent, in spite of expanding the
Sydney-based bank's branch network into Brisbane and other parts of
south-east Queensland.
Non-performing loans fell to ADollars 116m from ADollars 189m, equivalent to
2 per cent of total advances. This compared with 2.6 per cent in the
previous year.
ASB Bank, New Zealand's largest home loan lender, yesterday reported a fall
in net profits to NZDollars 35.4m (Dollars 19.3m) for the year to June 30,
from NZDollars 37.5m a year earlier, in spite of a record second-half
performance, writes Terry Hall in Wellington.
The directors said growth in business and a tight rein on overheads led to a
75 per cent improvement in operating profits to NZDollars 21.8m in the
second half.
