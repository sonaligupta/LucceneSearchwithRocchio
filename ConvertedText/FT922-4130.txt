FT  06 JUN 92 / Lloyd's claims successes in US legal battles


   By RICHARD LAPPER


LLOYD'S of London claimed successes yesterday in a complicated series of
legal battles with dissident US Names - the individuals whose assets provide
the insurance market's capital.
Yet its moves to increase its central fund, which pays claims when Names are
unable to meet their obligations, looks likely to be challenged by rebel
Names in the UK.
In the biggest US case, in which 91 Names are suing Lloyd's for breach of US
securities laws, Judge Maurice Lasker ruled earlier this week that the
plaintiffs must respond to a number of motions to dismiss the case, and
denied the Names permission to plead their complaints again.
Lawyers for Lloyd's say that means the court will now consider the issue of
jurisdiction in the case. Lloyd's, which says disputes between Names and
their agents should be heard in UK rather than US courts, has already scored
some victories in litigation with overseas Names on this issue.
On May 29 a US district court in Chicago dismissed a suit brought by Mr
Kenneth Bonny, Ms Francesca Bonny and one other US Name to prevent Lloyd's
from drawing down letters of credit in order to meet insurance claims.
Meanwhile, a number of Names intend to campaign to force Lloyd's to hold an
extraordinary general meeting of all Names. They are angry at a new
compulsory levy to be charged to all Names, needed to fund a Pounds 500m
increase in the central fund.
According to Mr Richard Astor, who is advising the group, the levy is 'a
sneaky attempt to bypass democratic controls at Lloyd's'.
In a separate development, the Society of Names, an organisation of Names
facing losses, has protested that the Lloyd's magazine, Lloyd's Log, is
refusing to carry a service reporting which syndicates are dominated by
working Names, who have jobs in the market.
