FT  30 NOV 94 / International Company News: Occidental to buy Placid Oil


   By REUTER


Occidental Petroleum is to acquire Placid Oil for about Dollars 250m,
consisting of Dollars 175m in Occidental preferred stock and the balance in
common stock, reports Reuter.
Occidental said the purchase would add to cash flow immediately, and would
not dilute earnings because of current production.
Placid, the oil and gas operations of the Hunt family, has exploration and
production properties in the US, Canada and the Netherlands.
Occidental said the Placid properties had proven and probable reserves of
about 17m barrels of oil and 270bn cubic feet of natural gas.
During 1994, daily production from these properties has averaged 6,000
barrels of oil and 100m cubic feet of natural gas.
Placid has an approximate 39 per cent interest in a pipeline system in the
Dutch sector of the North Sea, which includes 170 miles of main and feeder
lines.
Occidental said the transaction was expected to be completed by the end of
the year.
