FT  16 JAN 92 / International Company News: Adam Opel lifts turnover 15%


   By ANDREW FISHER


ADAM OPEL, the German subsidiary of General Motors, raised turnover last
year by 15 per cent to around DM27bn (Dollars 17bn) and increased its sales
in Germany by 26 per cent to 719,000 cars, Mr Louis Hughes, the chief
executive, said.
He also warned that excessive pay rises this year could endanger jobs in
Germany. 'I am very worried about wage developments in Germany,' he said.
The IG Metall trade union this week set a 9.5 per cent ceiling for regional
pay claims; last year's pay settlement in the engineering sector was 6.7 per
cent.
Mr Hughes declined to give any indication of Opel's profits for last year,
but said the result would again be one of the best in the German motor
industry. In 1990, net profits advanced by 18 per cent to DM1.3bn.
He said the jump in sales in 1991 occurred despite a 5 per cent fall in
production caused by the replacement of the Kadett by the new Astra family
model; the difference was made up by imports from other GM plants in Europe.
This year, Mr Hughes expected the German new car market to decline after
last year's surge in demand after unification.
'We expect a marked drop in the German market from 4.2m to around 3.5m
units,' he said. This would be a 17 per cent drop, but sales in 1992 would
still equal the second best year in western Germany.
