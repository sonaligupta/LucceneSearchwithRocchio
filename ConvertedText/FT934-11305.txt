FT  02 NOV 93 / Appeal over new Bosnia atrocities


   By LAURA SILBER

THE International Red Cross yesterday warned of mass expulsions in central
Bosnia amid allegations that civilians were being summarily executed, writes
Laura Silber in Belgrade.
The ICRC denounced the 'blatant violation' of international humanitarian law
around Vares, a Croat-held town in central Bosnia, appealing to the mostly
Moslem government army and Bosnian Croat forces to stop the 'harassment' of
civilians. 'Thousands of civilians have been forced to flee from their homes
. . . they are fleeing looting, death threats, mistreatment and are
desperately searching for protection,' the Geneva-based organisation said.
The Bosnian army is fighting against Croat forces for land near Vares.
The town straddles one of the main aid routes linking Sarajevo to Tuzla.
In Belgrade yesterday, Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, UN peace envoy, protested
against the detention of the crew of two Sea King choppers, who had been
delivering relief supplies to Srebrenica, the Moslem enclave in eastern
Bosnia. The incident comes after Serb forces flouting Srebrenica's status as
a UN 'safe area', seized control of part of the Moslem enclave.
