FT  09 JUN 92 / Malaysian minister to explain share deals


   By REUTER


   KUALA LUMPUR


A MINISTER accused of misappropriating shares in Malaysia's largest listed
company will be asked to explain his actions to the cabinet next week, Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad said yesterday, Reuter reports from Kuala Lumpur.
Mr S Samy Vellu, minister of energy, telecommunications and posts, will be
asked to give details of the sale of 9m shares in Telekom Malaysia, Mr
Mahathir told reporters.
Mr Samy Vellu, president of the country's main Indian party, the Malaysian
Indian Congress (MIC), has said the proceeds from the share sale went to a
college he helped set up.
Opposition leader Mr Lim Kit Siang accused Mr Samy Vellu last month of
'hijacking' 9m of 10m shares originally allotted to MIC's investment arm
Maika Holdings.
The 9m shares were later taken up by three companies and sold for a profit
of 7.16m ringgit (Pounds 1.5m). They would have been worth over 117.9m
ringgit at yesterday's prices.
