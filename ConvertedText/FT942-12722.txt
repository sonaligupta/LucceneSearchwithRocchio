FT  28 APR 94 / Arts: Today's Television


   By ANTONY THORNCROFT


Insights into two famous, but obscure, British traditions are the highlights
of tonight's viewing. Taking Liberties (BBC 2, 8pm) investigates the arcane
world of the coroner. Apparently, once appointed this is a job for life and
only one coroner has been removed since the second world war. But are all
inquests conducted with due attention to legal practice and the delicate
emotions of the bereaved? The emphasis here is on what can go wrong.
It is followed at 9.30 by True Brits, which for the first time goes inside
the Foreign Office. We follow the junior minister, Tristan Garel-Jones,
around Europe during the period of the UK's EC presidency, and watch
diplomatic discussions between our Civil Service elite and foreigners.
Outside Edge, Richard Harris's stage comedy, has transferred happily to
television and to extension. This affectionate tale of the tribulations
(mainly sexual) of a local cricket team is a civilised delight on the ITV
schedule (8.30). The players all hit it off so well that you can see a
follow-up series in the imaginations of the programmers. Not a bad idea.
