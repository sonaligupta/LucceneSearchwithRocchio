FT  06 JUN 92 / Japan's slowdown boosts trade surplus


   By STEVEN BUTLER

JAPAN'S April current account surplus rose by 22.1 per cent over a year ago
to Dollars 9.99bn (Pounds 5.5bn), reflecting a strong growth in exports and
a slower increase in imported goods.
The rising surplus continues the trend of the past year, although the pace
of increase has slowed, with April's surplus falling to Dollars 12.39bn, on
a seasonally adjusted basis, from Dollars 15.51bn in March.
Trade partners may be relieved to see the pace of growth in Japan's current
account surplus slowing, but there is no sign yet of a reversal in the
underlying trends.
Japan's current account surplus had been on a declining trend until last
year when imports began to fall and exports increased as a result, in part,
of the slowdown of Japan's economy.
Japan's Ministry of Finance said the 13 per cent year-on-year rise in
exports to Dollars 26.58bn was supported by a 20 per cent rise in car
exports, and increases in semiconductors and machinery exports. Imports rose
by 11.1 per cent to Dollars 16.58bn, boosted by large increases of food and
textile imports. The official said the rise in the trade surplus was
influenced by changing prices more than changing volumes of imports and
exports.
Japan last month returned to its usual position as a net exporter of
long-term capital after many months of importing capital. The long-term
capital account showed a net deficit of Dollars 3.43bn, compared to a
surplus of Dollars 8.84bn in March. While foreigners' net purchases of
Japanese equities fell from Dollars 2.63bn to Dollars 1.37bn and net
purchases of bonds worth Dollars 1.63bn in March turned into net sales of
Dollars 3.65bn in April, Japanese investors turned into net buyers of
foreign bonds, worth Dollars 4.88bn in April, compared with sales of a
similar amount in March.
