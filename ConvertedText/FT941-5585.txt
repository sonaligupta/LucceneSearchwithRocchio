FT  05 MAR 94 / UK Company News: NTL expands in Pounds 6.6m deal


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


NTL, the broadcast transmission and telecommunications company, has bought
an organisation specialising in mobile communications for emergency services
in a Pounds 6.6m deal, writes Raymond Snoddy.
DTELS was a government agency which used to be part of the Home Office. It
installs and maintains mobile communications from 56 sites around the UK and
employs nearly 500 people.
The deal means that NTL will be the majority supplier of mobile
communications for the emergency services.
A total of seven bids were received for DTELS, although in the end the
battle was between NTL - which is expected to have a turnover of about
Pounds 120m this year - and Pell Frischmann, the consulting engineers.
Later this year, NTL will consider whether to apply for a flotation
following completion of three years' accounts as a private company.
