FT  07 MAR 94 / Italian right shows strains


   By JOHN SIMKINS

Strains between right-wing allies contesting this month's Italian elections
burst into the open at the weekend with an attack on the Forza Italia party
of Mr Silvio Berlusconi by Mr Umberto Bossi, leader of the populist Northern
League.
Opinion polls suggest about 40 per cent of decided voters will back the
right wing in the March 27 poll, in opposition to a broad-left alliance led
by the former communist Party of the Democratic Left. However, Mr Bossi is
concerned that the emergence of Forza Italia is taking away votes from the
Northern League, which won nearly 9 per cent of the national vote in 1992
and had 79 MPs in both houses.
At a rally in Florence Mr Bossi said that Forza Italia had been created by
the former Christian Democrats (now the Popular party) 'to take votes from
the League and create a moderate grouping in order to recycle the old
political class'. In a play of words he also referred to 'Sforza Italia'
(Italian strain) and 'Falsa Italia' (False Italy).
Italian newspapers reported yesterday that Mr Bossi had also written to
League officials directing them not 'to support or put forward Forza Italia
candidates in any way at all'.
Mr Bossi was even more forthright in Florence about Mr Gianfranco Fini's
National Alliance, formerly the neo-fascist MSI, with which Forza Italia has
a technical alliance on division of seats. He said Mr Fini would not win
votes in the north, which has 'been traditionally anti-fascist'.
Mr Berlusconi responded to Mr Bossi's remarks with an appeal for unity on
the Italian right. 'Our partners' candidates are of the same flesh and blood
as us. They must be treated like our candidates,' he told a rally in
Florence.
Mr Berlusconi called on the members of the so-called Freedom Alliance to
'overcome selfishness and small-mindedness'.
