get the best deal - Building societies / The societies need more money, and
admit that investors with big sums are receiving more generous interest. But

Having almost negotiated the uncharted waters of the worst housing recession
for more than 50 years, building societies are facing another challenge: how
to attract and retain new money in the present low interest rate
environment.
Income from building society accounts has more than halved since interest
rates peaked in 1990, and increasingly income-seekers are looking elsewhere
for higher returns. As a result, societies are experiencing strong
competition from other savings institutions, particularly from the unit
trust industry and from National Savings, the Government's savings arm.
Unit trusts have been reporting record inflows of new money, on the back of
strong stock market performance; and National Savings had attracted Pounds
906m into its new Pensioner Guaranteed Income Bond by the end of March,
after the bond's launch in January. This competition has not yet caused
widespread concern within the building society industry, because the
fragility of the recovery in the housing market has meant that demand for
mortgage finance is still muted.
According to Graham Berville, who was until recently general manager of
development at Norwich & Peterborough but has since taken up an appointment
with Commercial Union: 'In the current climate, and with current levels of
mortgage demand, the issue is whether building societies need to attract
large volumes of retail funds. At the moment the products available enable
us to attract enough money to satisfy mortgage demand, although I think the
issue of wholesale funding will come into sharper focus over the next year
or so.'
David Gilchrist, general manager of the Halifax, adds: 'I don't think the
industry as a whole is having any problem funding the limited mortgage
business. Money is not leaving societies; savers are leaving the interest to
capitalise. It is just over-the-counter inflow that we are not getting.'
Gilchrist points out that some of the competition facing building societies
may also be short-lived. 'We think stock market returns are unsustainable
over the long term, and that there is some underestimation of the risk. We
can't rule out the possibility of a surge of inflow if anything should
happen to destabilise the stock market.'
David Blake, manager of corporate relations at the Woolwich, agrees: 'You
can't compete with the government's National Savings, but unit trusts are a
changing market. Anything that is linked to the stock market is an immediate
problem, but not a long-term one.'
Building societies also argue that many savers are suffering from what
Gilchrist describes as a 'money illusion', because they concentrate on
headline interest rates rather than returns in relation to inflation.
Berville says: 'People are looking at building society returns in terms of a
straight rate, but the rate in line with inflation looks pretty good. If in
the main your reason for investing is to maintain the value of your money, I
think a rate of 7 per cent, which is easily attainable, is not that bad.'
After several years of shielding battered borrowers, building society
managers are also conscious of the need to cushion their savers from the
effect of lower interest rates. Tim Melville-Ross, chief executive of
Nationwide, says: 'The reality is that even now savings rates are above the
prevailing market level. What we are essentially trying to do is protect the
saver, as we protected the borrower when interest rates were high.'
Few building society managers would deny that these days larger investors
are being rather more carefully protected than small savers, however.
'We are all trying to attract the big money,' acknowledges Blake. 'If you
look at the rates, you can't get much of a return on sums below Pounds
5,000. No one wants an account opened with Pounds 1 nowadays. We tend to
ignore that market. All marketing now is geared to the person who has a lot
of money.'
'We would regard Pounds 500 as a relatively small account,' agrees
Gilchrist. 'We pay good rates on children's and teenagers'accounts, but for
other investors a realistic savings target must be in four figures. We do
still have small savings accounts, but they are not paying much of a rate of
interest.'
Increasingly, too, building societies are widening their investment products
to cover unit trusts and equity-linked schemes, in order to meet the
financial needs of a more sophisticated audience.
As Melville-Ross explains: 'We have to ask ourselves what will happen if the
government has got it right, and we are in for a low-inflation, low-interest
rate, steady-growth environment. The scenario there is one of a much lower
demand on both sides of the balance sheet. You therefore end up with a
shrinking balance sheet unless you diversify.
Nevertheless, the savings account is still the core investment product of
every building society, and pricing is crucial if a society is to compete
both with other savings institutions and with its peers. These days some
customers will switch to another building society for a slender 0.5 per cent
interest rate advantage.
Berville comments: 'I came from outside the industry, and I was initially
surprised that the opportunity to differentiate a savings product was so
limited. People haven't done much with building society accounts. They
simply differentiate on price.'
Price advantage is the key to the success of postal accounts, the last major
building society innovation. The theory is that the saving on branch time
can be passed to customers with these accounts. Blake says: 'I think this is
where the growth area is, because a building society can then afford to
offer that little bit of extra margin. And I have to say that building
societies must start to question their huge branch networks.'
An initial deposit of Pounds 2,500 or Pounds 5,000 is required for many
postal accounts, but Birmingham Midshires and Teachers both accept a modest
Pounds 500.
Indeed, despite building societies' unblushing preference for the larger
investor, smaller savers need not despair if they conduct proper market
research. As Adrian Coles, director general of the Building Societies
Association, says: 'Small savers can still find some attractive deals if
they are he is prepared to shop around.'
Coles is also confident that building societies will be able to rise to the
challenge of the current competitive pressures, on both on the savings and
the mortgage fronts. And he cites three reasons for his optimism: 'Building
societies' management costs are lower than their major competitors'; their
image is better; and they are better liked.'
