FT  29 JAN 92 / International Company News: Cyanamid plans Dollars 50m
project to cut toxic waste


   By KAREN ZAGOR


AMERICAN Cyanamid, the US pharmaceuticals and specialty chemicals group,
yesterday said it would spend Dollars 50m on projects to cut its toxic
emissions by 79 per cent.
The announcement coincided with the release of findings by the Council on
Economic Priorities, a US public interest economic research agency, which
criticised Cyanamid's environmental record.
Ms Alice Tepper Marlin, founder and executive director of the agency,
described Cyanamid as the nation's third biggest emitter of toxic waste in
1989.
According to Ms Marlin, Cyanamid released an average of 41lb of toxic
chemical for every Dollars 1,000 of sales, or four times the chemical
industry average.
Cyanamid said yesterday that it would build a regeneration plant to recover
120m lb of sulphuric acid and other chemicals annually that were currently
disposed of by deepwell injection.
The company is also building a facility to recover acetonitrile and hydrogen
cyanide.
All of the new environmental projects will be located at the company's
Fortier plant in Waggaman, Louisiana, which the Council on Economic
Priorities described as the largest emitter of toxic pollution in the US in
1988 and the second largest in 1989.
