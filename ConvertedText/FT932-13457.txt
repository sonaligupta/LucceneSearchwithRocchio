FT  23 APR 93 / Figures give hope to all regions


   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff


THE UNEXPECTED fall in the number of people out of work and claiming benefit
last month was spread across every region of the UK, the first time this has
happened since January 1990, official figures showed yesterday.
The biggest falls were in Scotland and the east Midlands where the
unemployment rate dropped 0.2 percentage points to 9.6 per cent in both
areas.
The Department of Employment said there were a number of clues in the data
to suggest that falls in unemployment over the last two months were more
than just erratic figures.
These included a marked slowdown in the number of people joining the
unemployment count. Last month 338,000 people joined the dole queues, 14,300
fewer than in the same month last year, and 32,100 fewer than in February.
Meanwhile, 387,800 people left the count in March, slightly less than in
February, but 32,100 more than in the same month a year ago.
There were also encouraging signs from the vacancies figures. Unfilled
vacancies at Job-centres - about a third of all vacancies in the economy -
rose by 6,000 on the year to March, the highest level for two years. New
vacancies last month rose by 7,400 compared with February.
The fall in manufacturing employment also slowed. It fell by 11,000 in March
to 4.19m, the smallest fall since June last year.
Average earnings growth dropped again in February to 4.5 per cent from 4.75
per cent in January. This was the lowest rate for 25 years.
The slowing wage growth, along with improved productivity, caused a further
decline in unit labour costs. In the three months to the end of February,
manufacturing industry unit labour costs were 2 per cent lower than in the
same period a year earlier.
