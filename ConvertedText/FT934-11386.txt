FT  01 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: The politics that does not deserve
space


   From Mr P B MATTHEWS


Sir, As a recent convert to the FT, I hope you will allow me to say how much
I disagree with the letter from Jack Straw (October 28).
In considering what to publish, newspapers must remember that readers' time
is limited, and hence what matters is the importance to them of politicians'
speeches compared with other matter competing for space. I recently co-wrote
a book on a major new piece of legislation, and for this purpose I was
obliged to read every debate in both Houses of Parliament (including
committees). Frankly, 95 per cent of what I had to read was drivel that did
not deserve to be printed, even in Hansard, let alone in newspapers. And Mr
Straw may care to note that most of the remaining 5 per cent was uttered in
the House of Lords. I prefer to read a newspaper which prints things of some
value.
Granted, actual decisions of government or parliament, and the occasional
policy announcement, are - or may be - news, and may be reported on that
basis. However, the puerile posturing of self-important, second-rate
intellects is not. Hence my preference for the FT.
