FT  16 JUN 93 / Pay formula talks for firefighters


   By DAVID GOODHART


LOCAL authority employers will meet representatives of the Fire Brigades
Union at the end of this month in an attempt to quell the threat of
industrial action if the firefighters' pay formula is not restored next
year, David Goodhart writes.
Firefighters are one of the few groups of workers with the muscle and,
potentially, the public support to challenge the government's 1.5 per cent
public-sector pay policy.
For this year the 1.5 per cent pay rise for firefighters is likely to be
accepted in November. Under the pay formula firefighters' pay is linked to
the upper quartile of male manual earnings and this year the outcome from
the formula will not be far above the 1.5 per cent limit.
For next year the situation could be more complex and local authority
employers are likely to give a broad hint at the meeting later this month
that they will stick to the formula for 1994.
