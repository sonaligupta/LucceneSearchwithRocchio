FT  11 APR 94 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo


   By EMIKO TERAZONO


The fate of Japanese financial markets and the economy rests with how soon
the next government is formed following Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's
resignation announcement last Friday.
Political uncertainty is expected to last throughout the week, and investors
are unlikely to take on large positions until there is a clear indication of
what lies on the political horizon.
The worst case scenario for the economy, but a positive one for the bond
market, would be if the current coalition proved unable to decide on the
next prime minister, prompting a general election followed by a political
realignment.
Meanwhile, worries of oversupply may weigh on the bond market as municipal
governments and companies are likely to raise funds through the straight
bond this month.
Companies have had to refrain from corporate bond financing because of last
month's volatility on the bond market.
However, some traders expect instability stemming from uncertainty over US
interest rates to continue this week. Japanese bonds are likely to be
affected if
fears of further tightening by the US Federal Reserve Board destabilise the
US Treasury bond market.
