FT  26 JUN 92 / Channel 4 defends directors' rewards


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


SENIOR Channel 4 staff were paid a total of Pounds 800,000 as 'golden
handcuffs' last year, including a Pounds 250,000 payment to Mr Michael
Grade, chief executive.
The payments were in return for the signing of service contracts lasting
from three to five years to prevent poaching by bidders for ITV franchises.
The one-off payment took Mr Grade's salary for the year to a total of Pounds
485,000. Six other senior staff received payments that were the equivalent
of a year's salary.
Sir Richard Attenborough, the retiring chairman of Channel 4, defended the
controversial payments in the annual report published yesterday.
Securing the services of the management team, Sir Richard said, 'was an
absolute prerequisite for the future success and stability of the channel'.
Three directors doubled their 1991 salaries to between Pounds 180,000 and
Pounds 185,000. They were Mr Colin Leventhal, director of acquisitions, Mr
Frank McGettigan, general manager, and Mr David Scott, finance director.
The accounts also show a Pounds 5m provision for money lent to Bank of
Credit and Commerce International in the week before its collapse.
Sir Michael Bishop, chairman of British Midland Airways, is to succeed Sir
Richard as Channel 4 chairman. Mr David Plowright, who resigned as chairman
of Granada Television this year, is to be deputy chairman of the channel.
