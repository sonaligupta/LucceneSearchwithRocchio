FT  26 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Soundtracs falls to Pounds 175,000


Soundtracs, the USM-quoted professional audio equipment specialist,
announced a Pounds 20,000 drop in pre-tax profits to Pounds 175,000 in the
six months to April 30.
Turnover advanced to Pounds 1.72m (Pounds 1.57m) but the company said that
the continuing recession and depressed sales in Japan and the US resulted in
even more competitive prices.
The interim dividend is being held at 0.85p, payable from earnings of 1.17p
(1.29p) per share.
