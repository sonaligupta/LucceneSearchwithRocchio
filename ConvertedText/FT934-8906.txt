FT  12 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading


   By PETER JOHN


TECHNICAL position-taking drove stock index futures yesterday in the absence
of any fundamental economic impetus, while business in traded options was
dominated by heavy activity in Asda, writes Peter John.
The December FT-SE futures contract was inspired by a powerful performance
from Wall Street on Wednesday. It opened sharply higher at 3,114 and the
mark-up provided a good basis for a strong start in the underlying equity
market. December hit a high of 3,122, but there was little serious buying to
sustain the rise and the contract petered off through the day.
By the close it had dribbled back to 3,102, near its low of the day and only
two points above the cash market. This compared with fair value of around 10
points. Turnover was very poor, with only 6,846 December contracts dealt by
the official close.
Many dealers considered that at 3,100, December was at the middle of a
100-point range which will continue until the Budget.
Traded options turnover was dominated by three large deals in Asda, said to
have been carried out by Sheppards on behalf of Cazenove. The deals
apparently involved 2,630 January 50 calls bought at 4p each, 2,730 January
60 puts bought at 11 1/2 p and 2,630 January 50 puts sold at 4p. Total
options turnover dipped to around 36,000 lots from just under 40,000
previously.
