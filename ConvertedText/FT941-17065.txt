FT  06 JAN 94 / Observer: Mr Bobbie


If your ambition is to hobnob with City bigwigs, attend lots of banquets and
ride the best police horses in the Lord Mayor's show, hard luck. It sounds
as if the job of commissioner of the City of London Police has been filled.
Bill Taylor, 47, an assistant commissioner at Scotland Yard, appears to have
beaten Colin Coxall, the acting commissioner of the City police, to a post
which has been empty since Owen Kelly retired unexpectedly early.
Taylor will get more than Pounds 50m a year to police the Square Mile, so he
need never worry about having to cancel Royal visits because of a shortage
of funds. And given that reported crime in the City was 10 per cent down in
1992 compared with a 6 per cent rise across the nation, his bobbies should
have plenty of time to capitalise on their success in tracking down
fraudsters.
Not that the City is free of traditional crime. Commander Hugh Moore, the
respected number three in the City police, died last month, less than a
fortnight after being mugged by a man he was trying to arrest in Old Jewry,
near the force's headquarters.
