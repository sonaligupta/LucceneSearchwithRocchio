FT  01 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Nigerian airline fined in London


   By BETHAN HUTTON


Nigeria Airways was fined Pounds 60,000 for contempt of court in London
yesterday, after breaching injunctions intended to stop it undercutting a
travel agent's ticket prices, writes Bethan Hutton. The UK general manager
of Nigeria Airways, Mr Brendan Anugwom, was fined Pounds 2,000. The
injunctions were granted in July and November after CES Travel complained
that the state-owned airline was selling tickets at lower prices than
specified in a sales agreement.
