FT  27 JAN 94 / International Capital Markets: More than 1bn futures
contracts traded in 1993


   By TRACY CORRIGAN


Global trading of futures and options on exchanges exceeded 1bn contracts in
1993, a 20 per cent increase on 1992 volume, according to full-year figures
released yesterday by the Futures Industry Association, the US trade body
for the futures industry.
However, the 13 per cent rate of growth recorded by US exchanges was
substantially lower than the 34 per cent gain recorded by exchanges outside
the US.
Of the top 10 exchanges in the world in 1993, only four were US-based, while
four - Liffe in London, the Matif in Paris, Germany's DTB and the London
Metal Exchange - were European. However, the fastest growing exchanges were
BM&F in Brazil, where volume rose 49 per cent to 52m contracts, and Tiffe in
Japan, where volume grew 55 per cent to 24m contracts, which were placed
seventh and 10th respectively.
At the top of the table, the Chicago Board of Trade increased its lead on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, with 179m contracts and 147m contracts
respectively. In third place, Liffe's volume rose 35 per cent to just under
100m.
FIA volume figures exclude options on individual stocks.
