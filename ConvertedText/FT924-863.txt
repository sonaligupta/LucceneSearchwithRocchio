FT  22 DEC 92 / Brazilian 'death threats'


   By CHRISTINA LAMB


   BRASILIA


The Brazilian capital was in suspense yesterday on the eve of the
impeachment trial of suspended President Fernando Collor as senators claimed
they had received anonymous death threats warning them against voting for
impeachment, writes Christina Lamb in Braslia.
It was also learned that Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, Mr Collor's alleged
front-man, had fled with his family to Seville in Spain, travelling in his
private jet. Mr Mauricio Correa, justice minister, has ordered a police
investigation.
Mr Collor's fate will be determined by the country's 81 senators in a
marathon 16-hour session presided over by the head of the Supreme Court. A
two-thirds vote is needed to impeach Mr Collor. If condemned he will face
criminal charges and Mr Itamar Franco, his former vice-president and now
acting president, will be sworn in.
