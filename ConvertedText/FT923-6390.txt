FT  25 AUG 92 / Industry fears weak dollar will worsen recession


   By OUR INDUSTRIAL STAFF


LEADING British industri-alists yesterday voiced fears that the rise of
sterling to Dollars 2 would worsen the recession.
Mr Martin Taylor, chief executive of Courtaulds Textiles, said the fall in
the dollar would cost his company several million pounds a year. 'It is the
biggest problem in the industry for five years,' he said. 'The European
currency bloc is ridiculously overvalued.'
Jaguar, which last year had 44 per cent of its sales in the US, described
the dollar rate as preposterous.
Mr David Boole, director of public affairs, said: 'For Jaguar as an
operating unit the exchange rate is a disaster. Our cars have little US
content. It is still the problem of making cars in pounds and selling them
in dollars.'
Mr Peter Bates, sales and marketing director of the Savoy hotel group, said:
'There is no doubt that it is very expensive for an American to come here at
the moment.'
The number of guests from the US, who account for 50 per cent of the group's
customers, has fallen by 10 per cent. Since last November American guests at
the group's hotels have been offered rooms at a fixed exchange rate of
Dollars 1.70 to the pound.
Other companies were less worried. The automotive component maker T&N said
the dollar rate was 'not much of a problem in real terms'.
Mr Colin Hope, T&N chairman and chief executive, said: 'Our US companies are
virtually currency neutral in terms of their balance sheets and borrowings.
We do not export much to the US from Europe now since we have big US
manufacturing operations.
GEC, the electronics group which has extensive operations in the US, said
the strength of sterling would be only marginally more negative than
positive.
Smiths Industries, the aerospace company which has plants in the US and UK,
said the currency change was a factor in deciding where to locate new
production. But Mr Christopher Taylor, finance director, said: 'Sales into
dollar economies which are being delivered now were sold at much better than
the present rate. And the forward rate over two years for new deals is more
like Dollars 1.80.'
Mr Taylor also pointed out that the group hedged its dollar exposure.
Courtaulds Textiles' Mr Martin Taylor said this did not apply in his
company's case. 'You can't hedge economic disadvantage. Imports come in from
countries with a dollar cost base like the Far East. It isn't about exports,
it's about import competition.'
Mr Donald Anderson, chief economist at chemicals company Courtaulds, said
the effect of the cheap dollar was limited by long-term contracts and high
barriers to entry in its markets.
But he said 'the dollar is a problem when we translate our profits into
sterling'.
Computer manufacturers said the impact of the falling dollar was broadly
neutral. Most computer components  - microprocessors, disk drives and power
supplies  - are bought in dollars. The slight advantage this will give
non-US suppliers, however, will quickly be countered by the lower cost of
complete US-made systems.
Dr Peter Horne, chairman of Apricot Computers, the UK-based workstation
manufacturer owned by Mitsubishi of Japan, which turned over Pounds 45m last
year, said it might mean an extra 1 per cent or 2 per cent on gross profit
margins, but the effect would be swamped by the savage price-cutting which
characterises the global personal computer business.
Mr Stan Boland, treasurer for ICL, owned by Fujitsu of Japan, said the
company bought components for its personal computers and mid-range systems
in dollars, but hedged against currency fluctuations by means of forward
contracts and options.
Blue Circle, Britain's biggest cement manufacturer, said: 'We operate as a
local producer rather than an exporter. We have not repatriated profits in
recent years but have re-invested them in the US cement and concrete
businesses. All our US borrowings are matched against US assets. We are less
vulnerable, therefore, to currency fluctuations.'
Some other companies said that conditions were so bad in the US that the
dollar's weakness made little difference.
One UK group with housebuilding and aggregates interests in the US said: 'It
would be nice to have enough US profits to be adversely affected by currency
movements.'
For one group of companies the move is good news. Travel operators say that
prices of holidays to the US have come down. Prices to other destinations
have also eased because the travel companies pay for their aircraft fuel in
dollars.
Mr Roger Heape, managing director of British Airways Holidays, said that the
state of the dollar had allowed the company to offer 1993 holidays at prices
6 per cent lower than this year. BA Holidays has been able to introduce new
holiday programmes to the US west coast, New England and the north-east.
