FT  28 JUL 92 / Observer: Welcome for Hannam


One man who ought to have earned a mention in dispatches for his role in the
Wellcome share sale is 36-year-old Ian Hannam, the man responsible for
Robert Fleming's global book building team. Getting an issue of this size
away in current conditions would have tested the talents of the best
connected merchant bankers.
As it is, Hannam is one of Fleming's most recent recruits. The merchant bank
was lucky to catch him on the rebound from Salomon Brothers. There is a
suspicion that Fleming, whose capital markets team is good, but not that
good, wouldn't have landed the Wellcome plum had it not been for Hannam. He
joined for a month's consulting, but somehow just stayed.
Roger Gibbs, chairman of the Wellcome Trust which was selling the shares,
says Hannam was 'utterly splendid'. He dedicated himself completely to the
sale over the past few weeks, although on his fourth wedding anniversary
last Thursday he did slip out for an hour to see his wife. But will he stay
once the loose ends of the deal are tied up?
While Hannam didn't look out of place in Fleming's orange and blue 'war
room', it is less easy to imagine him retreating into its rather dour
environment once the excitement has abated. But Lawrence Banks, Fleming's
corporate finance chief, is optimistic and says his bank has room for a few
oddballs.
