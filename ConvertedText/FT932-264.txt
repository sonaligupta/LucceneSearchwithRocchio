market

   NEW YORK


LTV, the US steel company at the centre of one of the longest and most
contentious US bankruptcies, is coming back to the stock market, writes
Nikki Tait in New York.
The company said yesterday the New York Stock Exchange had approved trading
of LTV's new common stock and its series A warrants on a 'when-issued'
basis. The return marks the end of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy process which
began in July 1986. LTV finally had a plan of reorganisation confirmed by
the bankruptcy court on May 27.
