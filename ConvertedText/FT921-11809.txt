FT  30 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Fears over doctors' performance pay


   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff


PERFORMANCE PAY for 50,000 hospital doctors would be opposed if it was based
only on the number of patients they treated, the British Medical Association
said yesterday.
The BMA, which represents most of Britain's doctors, said it wanted
performance indicators to be based on the quality of patient care given, and
not just on its quantity.
The government wants to introduce performance pay for doctors next year.
It is understood that the Department of Health has asked the doctors' pay
review body to consider bonus payments for doctors who treat more patients
and cut waiting lists.
The BMA said it was concerned that there would be no additional funds for
performance pay, but that it would be 'a redistribution of income, with some
people paid more and others less.'
It said it was particularly concerned about performance indicators for
junior hospital doctors, who often worked up to 100 hours a week.
Performance-related pay for nurses is also being discussed, and is opposed
by the nursing unions.
