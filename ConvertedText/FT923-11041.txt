FT  27 JUL 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: US basketball team punish Angola


The US Dream Team purred like a cat and roared like a lion as they
pulverised a woefully overmatched Angola 116-48 in their opening basketball
game.
Sputtering only at the very start against the African champions, the team of
millionaire superstars flew to victory after scoring an amazing 31
unanswered points.
