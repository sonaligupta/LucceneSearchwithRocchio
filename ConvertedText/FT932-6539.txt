Norway's minority Labour government may face a vote of confidence on June 8
over its handling of the collapse last autumn of Uni Storebrand, the
country's biggest insurance group, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo.
The Conservative and right-wing Progress parties yesterday agreed to table a
proposal in parliament in which they will seek to unseat Mr Sigbjoern
Johnsen, the finance minister. They say if they succeed in winning majority
support for the proposal it could force the resignation of the government.
