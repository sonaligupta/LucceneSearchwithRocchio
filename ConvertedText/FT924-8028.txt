FT  13 NOV 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Touchy screen under pressure


   By DELLA BRADSHAW


Companies interested in touch-screen technology but reticent to throw away
existing personal computers could find the answer in TouchMate, a two-inch
high, pressure-sensitive platform which sits beneath the PC monitor and
converts the ordinary PC into a touch-screen model. Developed in the US by
Visage, and sold in Europe by Ellinor Technology, TouchMate costs Pounds
650.
When the screen is touched, plates in the platform sense the pressure; from
that, TouchMate calculates the location of the pressure. The PC, running
Windows software, then carries out the task as instructed.
To install the system the user sits the monitor on the platform and then
connects the two via the PC's serial port.
To calibrate the system, the user touches the four corners of the screen.
The TouchMate software adjusts constantly to allow for background noise or
wobble. Ellinor Technology: UK, 0734 311066; Visage: US, 508 620 7100.
To save the weary arms of City dealers, Trinitech, of Stamford, Connecticut,
has developed a dealing room system incorporating colour touch screens which
can sit flat on the desk. The flat screens use the same thin-film transistor
technology incorporated in the latest portable computers. Trinitech: US, 203
328 3766; UK, 071 935 1220.
