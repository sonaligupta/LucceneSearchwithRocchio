FT932-3274

FT  15 JUN 93 / Observer: One-stop bid


Good to see a spot of aviation romance surfacing amid the industrial gloom
at the Paris Air Show. The European Airbus consortium has dispatched one of
its latest craft on a record-breaking run.
A four-engine A340 set off from Le Bourget yesterday on a round the world
tour. Flying east, its first and only port of call will be New Zealand,
which should be reached in just under a day.
If all goes well it should be back at Le Bourget on Friday. Airbus has had
to cut the number of passengers from 273 to just 20 but it did not have to
sink to towing its showpiece to the end of the runway to save fuel, as
Boeing did when they attempted a similar feat with its non-stop 747-400
flight from London to Sydney.
Airbus hopes its marketing ploy will interest high-rolling customers with
global ambitions. The Sultan of Brunei, for instance, has already bought a
second-hand Lufthansa A340 for his personal use.
The French secret services, which have been known to venture that far
afield, might also be interested by the A340's first non-stop flight to
Auckland, if they ever needed a craft for another quick get away.
