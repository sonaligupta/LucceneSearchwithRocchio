FT  21 APR 94 / World Trade News: Waste-to-energy project in Taiwan


   By ANDREW HILL


   MILAN


Ansaldo Volund, a Danish subsidiary of Ansaldo, the Italian state-controlled
engineering company, and Chung-Hsin Electric & Machinery, its Taiwanese
partner, have won contracts worth Dollars 300m (Pounds 205.4m) to build
waste-to-energy incinerators for two Taiwanese cities, Andrew Hill writes
from Milan. The orders are worth about Dollars 200m to Chung-Hsin and
Dollars 100m to Ansaldo Volund, for a four-year project which will generate
electricity for the equivalent of 20,000 families in the cities of Pali and
Hsinchu.
Ansaldo, which is controlled by the Italian state engineering group
Finmeccanica, said the award would give Ansaldo Volund 40 per cent of the
Taiwanese market for incinerating urban waste, or 50 per cent if the share
of NKK, the Japanese company to which the Danish group has granted a
licence, is included. The group has won orders for two other incinerators in
Taiwan.
