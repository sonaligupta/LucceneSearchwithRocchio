FT  15 DEC 94 / International Company News: Cedel to become a bank next
month


   By RICHARD LAPPER


Cedel, the international clearing and settlement company, will become a bank
next month following a vote by shareholders, it announced yesterday, writes
Richard Lapper.
Cedel also announced that it had been granted an A1+ credit rating - the
highest short-term rating - by IBCA, the London-based credit rating agency.
Cedel, whose shareholders comprise nearly 100 of the international banks, is
one of the world's biggest clearing, settlement and depository
organisations, with a 24 per cent share of the market for clearing
international traded securities.
Its move to achieve banking status was prompted by the Basle agreement on
international bank capital adequacy rules, which require deposits against
unsettled trades held at a corporation such as Cedel to carry a 100 per cent
risk weighting.
