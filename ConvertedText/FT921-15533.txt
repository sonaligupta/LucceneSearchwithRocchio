FT921-15533

FT  09 JAN 92 / Observer: Confidence index


A plea for political stability from George Inge, chairman of Savills, the
upper crust firm of estate agents which reported another loss yesterday and
passed its dividend again. The current housing slump is the worst Inge can
remember in his 30 years in the business and he shudders at the thought of
what the return of a Labour government might do to his wealthy clients.
According to Savills, central London house prices have fallen by 16.5 per
cent from their 1989 peak, while country house prices have fallen by 15.4
per cent. Traditionally, the London market gets hit first and recovers
first, and Inge sees the same thing happening again. Although his firm is
seeing increasing numbers of repossessions at the upper end of the market,
the good news for clients is that forced sales are 'making vendors more
realistic about asking prices'.
