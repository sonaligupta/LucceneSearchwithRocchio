FT  24 AUG 92 / International Company News: Minorco may close Yuba Westgold
unit


   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent


MINORCO, the Luxembourg-based investment arm of the Anglo American
Corporation of South Africa, has given up its efforts to dredge gold from
shallow seas. It invested about Dollars 90m in two of these ventures in the
past five years.
Dredging operations off Nome, Alaska, were permanently shut down in
September 1990, and it seems the end is nigh for Yuba Westgold. This company
has been producing about 25,000 troy ounces of gold a year with an offshore
dredge near Marysville, California.
Western Gold Exploration and Mining, a 78-per-cent-owned Minorco subsidiary
which in turn has two thirds and management control of Yuba, said it would
not provide additional financing for Yuba.
Consequently Yuba said it may have to file for protection from its creditors
under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy law after failing to make a scheduled
payment to Bank of America.
Minorco originally put Dollars 80m cash into Westgold in 1987 in a joint
venture with its US subsidiary, Inspiration Resources.
Inspiration contributed some gold properties, including the one off Alaska.
Then in 1989 Westgold paid about Dollars 16m and a production royalty for
Yuba.
Inspiration Resources and Minorco shared a Dollars 30m charge in respect of
the Alaskan closure.
