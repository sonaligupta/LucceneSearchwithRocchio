FT  27 MAY 93 / BAe settles Pounds 57.6m 'sweeteners' bill


   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent


BRITISH Aerospace yesterday paid Pounds 57.6m to the UK government to settle
the long-running case over the 'state sweeteners' it received when it
acquired the Rover car group in 1988.
In March, the European Commission ordered the government to recover Pounds
44.4m from the company after it had ruled that the benefits that BAe had
received from the government constituted illegal state aid. BAe has paid
Pounds 57.6m - Pounds 11m for the aid it received and Pounds 46.6m in
interest.
By recovering the tax relief which would have been available on the interest
payments, BAe expects to reduce the net cost of the settlement by Pounds
15.4m to Pounds 42.2m.
The government has agreed to deposit the Pounds 15.4m in special accounts
until the tax position is clarified.
BAe said yesterday that the Pounds 42.2m net cost of the repayment will be
added to the original Pounds 150m purchase price for Rover - increasing the
total cost of the acquisition to Pounds 192.2m.
But the settlement is not expected to affect current-year profits because
the cost will be charged against the acquisition reserve created at the time
of the deal.
The issue was first raised in 1990 by Sir Leon Brittan, then EC competition
commissioner, but became entangled in long procedural wrangles before the
European Court of Justice.
The company welcomed the conclusion of the 'sweeteners' saga. 'It was most
encouraging to see the manner in which the Department of Trade and Industry
worked to ensure that the basis for final settlement met the EC requirement
fairly,' said Mr Richard Lapthorne, finance director of BAe.
