This massive and comprehensive study of the relationship between labour law
and governments since the second world war deserves to enjoy a readership
beyond that of labour law students.
It is far more than just a legal textbook, and of genuine value to anybody
interested in what remains one of the most important subjects in post-war
British politics.
Not only do the authors provide a full and succinct account of the
development of industrial relations legislation, from the days of full
employment in the late 1940s to today's flexible labour market; they also
relate this to a wider political context.
The book shows how the minimalist system, based on voluntarist principles
(so-called laissez faire collectivism) that believed employers and trade
unions alone should decide the outcomes of collective bargaining, came under
pressure from the demands of an increasingly interventionist state committed
to full employment and economic growth.
From the early 1960s, successive government attempts were made to replace or
modify voluntarism with a more legally regulated system.
The authors themselves would like to see the creation of a 'more stable, yet
juridified system of labour law' in Britain which would combine 'individual
industrial justice with collective representation' in a 'socially balanced
and reasonably humane political economy', as in most of the European Union.
