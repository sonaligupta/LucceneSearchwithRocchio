FT  05 MAR 94 / Liverpool oilfield supply base named


   By ROBERT CORZINE


West Hornby Dock in the port of Liverpool has been chosen as the site for a
shore supply base to support the Liverpool Bay oil and gas development.
The base will be the main point through which equipment and materials will
pass on their way to the offshore site during the project's construction,
drilling and operational phases. The first oil should begin to flow in
November 1995. The first gas is due a month later.
Competition for the supply base was fierce, with at least eight west coast
harbours vying for the contract. About Pounds 40m will be spent each year to
support the Liverpool Bay development once it becomes operational. Between
20 and 25 permanent jobs will be created at the base, said Hamilton Oil, the
field's operator.
