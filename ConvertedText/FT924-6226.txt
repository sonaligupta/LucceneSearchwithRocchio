FT  23 NOV 92 / ANC threat to stop constitution talks


   By PATTI WALDMEIR


   JOHANNESBURG


THE African National Congress (ANC) has threatened to break off talks with
the South African government on a new constitution unless a date for interim
government elections is set when the two sides meet for bilateral
negotiations, expected to take place next week, writes Patti Waldmeir in
Johannesburg.
This latest ANC ultimatum which was repeated at the weekend by its two most
senior leaders, President Nelson Mandela and Secretary General Cyril
Ramaphosa, appeared to be an attempt to press home the ANC's current
tactical advantage over the government, which has been weakened by
disclosures of a military intelligence plot to undermine the ANC. However
the government was quick to reject the ultimatum, saying that a date for
interim government must be agreed in broad-based multi-party talks.
