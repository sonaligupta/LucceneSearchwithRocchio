FT  12 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Manders expands by 50% to Pounds 9m


   By PETER PEARSE


EXTRAORDINARY charges of Pounds 2.12m in Manders (Holdings) 1992 results
included Pounds 1.9m defence costs incurred in the hostile Pounds 106.1m bid
it repelled from Kalon, the paints group, in August.
By choosing not to adopt FRS 3 accounting standards in the figures for the
12 months, the paints, inks and property group's pre-tax profits emerged 50
per cent ahead at Pounds 9.04m (Pounds 6.04m).
Earnings per share rose to 17.3p (13p), but, had the extraordinaries been
exceptionals, would have slipped to 12.15p.
A final dividend of 6.4p (5p) is proposed for a total of 9p (7p), a rise of
almost 29 per cent.
The Pounds 216,000 balance of extraordinary charges related to the sale to
its management of the North American operations and the sale of the
industrial paint products business to Croda International. The tile business
was also sold.
Mr Roy Amos, chairman, said the group was now in new shape. The board had
been restructured - partly as a reaction to the bid, but mostly to be ready
for growth and acquisition possibilities. The four-year spate of heavy
capital expenditure, when some Pounds 25m was spent, was over, he said, and
the disposals and closer control of working capital had cut borrowings to
Pounds 18.9m (Pounds 33.3m), reducing gearing to 29 (53) per cent. Interest
charges fell 17 per cent to Pounds 3.37m (Pounds 4.05m).
Group turnover rose 9 per cent to Pounds 110.3m (Pounds 101.6m) with
continuing operations up 24 per cent at Pounds 95m (Pounds 77m) and
discontinued down at Pounds 10m (Pounds 20m). The Manders Centre chipped in
Pounds 5.29m (Pounds 4.91m) and from this made operating profits of Pounds
4.81m (Pounds 4.39m).
The coatings and inks side, reduced from nine locations to three, made
profits of Pounds 3.73m (Pounds 3.05m) on turnover of Pounds 41.7m (Pounds
39.5m). The decorative division, with a full-year from Windeck, the
own-label paint maker, made Pounds 3.5m (Pounds 2.21m) on turnover of Pounds
53.5m (Pounds 37.4m).
