FT  26 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Caledonia Invs declines to Pounds 34.7m


   By ROLAND RUDD


CALEDONIA Investments, in which the Cayzer family holds 46.2 per cent of the
shares, saw pre-tax profits decline to Pounds 34.7m (Pounds 35.3m) for the
year to March 31.
Mr Peter Buckley, chief executive, said the company was affected by falling
interest rates as it switched from British & Commonwealth Holdings
preference shares and cash deposits to other investments.
Profits from trading activities rose to Pounds 6.9m (Pounds 1m), due to
higher input from Amber Industrial Holdings, in which Caledonia holds 75 per
cent.
However, this increase was offset by a fall in investment income to Pounds
18.6m (Pounds 23.2m) and net interest receivable from Pounds 13.9m to Pounds
12.2m.
Caledonia is proposing to purchase up to 10 per cent of its share capital at
355p a share - a small premium to Wednesday's closing price. The shares
yesterday rose by 23p to 362p.
Earnings per share fell from 25p to 24.1p.
An increased final dividend of 9.6p, takes the total for the year to 14.4p
(13.5p).
