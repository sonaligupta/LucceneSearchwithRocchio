FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Chrysalis considers options on distribution


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


Chrysalis, the music and media group, is considering the possibility of
joining a consortium bidding for the Channel 5 franchise or launching a
channel for cable or satellite television.
'Channel 5 is not the only method of distribution,' said Mr Chris Wright,
chairman of Chrysalis, which will make 3,000 hours of television this year.
The company, which yesterday announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 3.39m for
the year to August 31 on turnover from continuing operations up from Pounds
59m to Pounds 68.9m, has not yet decided which option to choose. However, it
is keen to keep its status as an independent producer.
The pre-tax loss of Pounds 14.6m the previous year included a provision of
Pounds 11.1m against losses on the closure of discontinued businesses such
as the MAM Leisure amusement machine operation. The 1994 results reflect a
credit of Pounds 1.5m released from the provision.
Losses per share were 11.06p (34.44p).
Mr Wright, a significant shareholder in Chrysalis, said that 'excellent
progress' had been made in refocusing the company on the multi-media
entertainment industry.
'As anticipated, the extensive investment that this has necessitated has
impacted on short-term profitability but I am confident that our long-term
goal of a substantial enhancement of shareholder value will be achieved.'
Chrysalis has decided not to pay a dividend for the year and it is clear
that the start-up costs of Crystal FM, the new commercial radio licence for
London won against intense competition, is likely to be enough to keep the
company in loss in the current financial year.
Chrysalis, and probably its shareholders, will expect the company to move
into profit in 1995-96. At present shareholders' funds stand at Pounds 45m.
The shares closed unchanged at 245p.
