FT  18 APR 94 / UK Company News: Murray Johnstone to launch trust


   By ANDREW BOLGER


Murray Johnstone, the Glasgow-based investment management group, is planning
a new investment trust specialising in small UK companies to be known as
Murray Acorn Trust.
The trust's size and the timing of the launch have not been settled, but the
group said it intends to focus on quoted companies with a market
capitalisation of less than Pounds 50m, of which there are about 1,100.
Murray Johnstone said prospects at the smaller end of the sector remained
good. These companies were under-researched by stockbrokers and less widely
owned by institutional investors, so the proposed fund could fulfil a useful
role for both institutional and private investors.
Mr Alistair Stewart of Murray Johnstone said recent market wariness towards
the continuing flood of new investment trusts was a concern, but he was
confident of this sector's appeal.
