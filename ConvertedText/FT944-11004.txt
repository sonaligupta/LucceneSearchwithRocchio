FT  08 NOV 94 / International Company News: Engelhard in joint venture with
CLAL of France


   By KENNETH GOODING


Engelhard Corporation, the New York-listed company which is 30 per
cent-owned by Minorco, the overseas arm of the Anglo American-De Beers group
of South Africa, has signed a letter of intent to put most of its precious
metals fabricating operations into a joint venture with CLAL of France.
CLAL, quoted in Paris, is part of Mr Marc Ladreit de Lacharriere's Fimalac
financial-industrial group.
The 50-50 joint venture, to be based in France, would have annual revenues
of about USDollars 1bn, derived equally from the partners, and employ 2,600,
about 1,750 from CLAL. It would combine Engelhard's strengths in platinum
group metal fabricated products with those of CLAL in gold and silver
products.
CLAL claims market leadership in France, Spain, Scandinavia and the
Netherlands while Engelhard has a strong position in the UK, Italy, the US
and east Asia.
Although there is almost no overlap between the two, there is scope for
rationalisation, Engelhard said.
The deal is not expected to be completed for some months.
