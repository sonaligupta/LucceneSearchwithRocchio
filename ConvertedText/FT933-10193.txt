FT  05 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Midland Bank


Having misread the interest rate trend so badly - and so expensively - in
the still recent past, Midland might have looked the least likely of the
clearers to wade into the gilts market. But the expertise and capital of its
new parent have allowed it to set an example in this respect. Not all the
Pounds 3.62bn first-half increase in its securities holdings represents
gilts, but its decision to exploit the yield curve has not only boosted
trading income. It has also helped to limit the squeeze on domestic net
interest margins. Midland thus demonstrates that there are rewards for banks
which do more than sit on their hands in difficult lending markets. Others,
such as Barclays and National Westminster, may feel too constrained by
capital or worried by risk to follow suit. And Mr Roger Bootle, the Midland
group's gilts guru, is an outspoken bull of that market. The real test,
though, will come when interest rates stop falling. Profits in gilt-edged,
as in foreign exchange, are difficult to sustain. Nor should the glittering
performance of Midland's treasury obscure the continuing difficulties of UK
branch banking. Loan demand is slow and, thanks apparently to Queens Moat
and Isosceles, provisions remain uncomfortably high. There could yet be an
unresolved dilemma between the need to contain costs and Midland's
aspiration to increase market share.
