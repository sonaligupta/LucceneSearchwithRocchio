FT  30 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading


   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY


MARKING time was the spirit of the day in Footsie futures with the December
contract showing no real sense of direction, writes Christine Buckley.
A quiet opening was followed by a squeeze on the contract which pushed it up
higher. In thin volume, it edged its way up to the psychologically important
resistance level of 3,200 but fell 3 short of that at its day's high.
Hopes had been raised in the morning that there would be a strong gilts
market, mainly fuelled by optimism that the chancellor could be forced into
a full point cut in interest rates in the Budget. That hope proved fruitless
and no positive lead was offered by gilts.
The contract drifted off in the afternoon and it touched its day's low of
3,182. A small rally was mustered to push it up to a closing level of 3,186,
just marginally ahead of its fair value premium to cash. Volume was steady
at 8,104.
Traded options were subdued with a total of 26,545 lots dealt. Index options
proved a substantial part of that activity with 11,735 lots traded in the
FT-SE 100 option.
