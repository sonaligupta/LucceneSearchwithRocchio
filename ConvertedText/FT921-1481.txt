FT  24 MAR 92 / International Bonds: Unibanco launches Dollars 100m deal


   By TRACY CORRIGAN


ACTIVITY in the Eurobond market dwindled to a virtual standstill yesterday
due to adverse conditions in most continental European government bond
markets and an overhang of paper in the dollar sector.
But there was some activity in the specialised market for Latin American
borrowers.
Unibanco (Uniao de Bancos Brasilieros), a private-sector Brazilian bank,
launched a Dollars 100m two-year deal, arranged by Citicorp Investment Bank.
The deal carries a 10 per cent coupon and was priced to yield 10 1/2 per
cent semi-annually, which amounts to a spread over the comparable US
Treasury of 462 basis points.
The deal was oversubscribed, according to Citicorp and was bid at 99 1/8 at
the close of European trading, just above its fixed reoffer level.
Spreads on Brazilian issues have tightened dramatically. State sector
borrowers are now paying around 350 basis points over the comparable
Treasury yield at two years, against 600 to 700 basis points when Brazil
returned to the market last year, despite the fact Brazil has still not
reached an agreement with its creditor banks over its commercial debt
restructuring.
Another Brazilian borrower is expected to tap the Eurodollar bond market
shortly. Copene (Copanhia Petroquimica do Nordeste), a private sector
petrochemical company, is preparing to launch a Dollars 50m two-year deal
which will have an 11 per cent coupon, with a 12 per cent yield to maturity.
Neither the Unibanco nor the Copene deals will be affected by a change in
Brazilian withholding tax rules. However, future deals must have a maturity
of more than 2 1/2 years in order to be exempt from 25 per cent withholding
tax on coupon payments to foreign investors. Until now, the minimum maturity
for exemption was two years.
