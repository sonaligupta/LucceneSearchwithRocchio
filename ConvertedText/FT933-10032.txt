FT  06 AUG 93 / Scotch Whisky makers report continued decline in UK sales


   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE


SCOTCH WHISKY makers yesterday reported a continued decline in UK sales and
renewed their call for an easing of the tax on spirits, Philip Rawstorne
writes.
Industry figures for the year to May showed a 5.5 per cent fall in sales.
The Scotch Whisky Association said the government was taking less money in
spite of the Pounds 7.16 tax on every bottle. 'Treasury receipts from
spirits in 1992-93 were down Pounds 80m - 7 per cent in real terms - and are
already heading for a similar loss this year.'
The association blamed the government's taxation policy for encouraging
other European Community members to raise spirits duties.
Mr James Bruxner, association chairman, said nine EC countries had increased
the tax differential between spirits and other drinks during the past 12
months.
Exports to the EC in the first five months of the year were 2 per cent lower
than in the same period last year.
