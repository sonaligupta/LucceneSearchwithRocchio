FT  05 AUG 93 / Letter: Waste elimination is 'green' priority


   From Mr CHARLIE KRONICK


Sir, If costs are to be at least partially the basis of future environment
and energy policies in the UK ('High cost of going green', August 2), then
it is unlikely that nuclear power will be a part of any policy designed to
reduce carbon dioxide emissions (C0) from electricity generation.
The recently published results of Nuclear Electric paint a rather grim
picture of that company's economic future. Take away the subsidy of more
than Pounds 1.2bn received each year from the electricity consumer, and
Nuclear Electric made an operating loss of Pounds 783m in the financial year
1991-1992, and Pounds 661m in 1992-1993, while at the same time stacking up
new liabilities for waste and decommissioning of almost Pounds 1.2bn (to be
added to the existing liabilities of almost Pounds 20bn). Meanwhile, it is
not just the environmentalists who are pointing out the potential of energy
efficiency and renewable energy. In 1989, the Department of Energy
identified cost effective energy savings potential of 30 per cent, with a
pay-back period of less than five years. Analysis of data from the
government's Energy Efficiency Office, submitted to the government's recent
review of the coal industry, shows that investment in nuclear power is only
one quarter as effective in reducing C0 as the poorest of the energy
efficiency measures examined. Money spent on nuclear power is only just over
half as effective as modern renewable technologies such as wind power in
reducing C0 emissions. Fully one third of the C0 reductions are available at
negative costs.
If the UK is serious about reducing C0 emissions, the first item on its
'green' agenda must be to put an end to waste; not just the waste of energy,
but the waste of money on dangerously polluting and massively expensive
technologies such as nuclear power.
