FT  23 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei firms as Manila
sets all-time high

FUTURES-related trading dominated activity as the trial began of a former
'godfather' of the Liberal Democratic party, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average gained 34.90 at 20,115.81, after moving between 20,049.60
and 20,152.82. Arbitrage buying linked to the Nikkei 225 futures supported
the index, but the Topix index of all first section stocks shed 2.03 to
1,634.28, reflecting an overall easier tone. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50
index edged up 1.17 to 1,245.10.
Volume remained below 300m shares for the fourth straight session, being
estimated at 240m shares, against a previous 254m. Declines led rises by 535
to 418, with 203 issues unchanged.
Traders said that many investors are determined to wait out the current
political uncertainty. On the first day of his trial, Mr Shin Kanemaru, a
former leading LDP member, denied charges of tax evasion. Meanwhile, the LDP
was thrown into turmoil as younger members opposed the proposed selection
method for the next party president.
Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities said investors will not participate until
the political situation was resolved. He added that the downside remained
firm as the current levels were unattractive for sellers.
The construction sector lost 0.74 per cent on fears that the Kanemaru trial
could implicate leading construction companies. Kajima dropped Y32 to Y760.
Hazama, which fell to a year's low on Wednesday because of its role in a
bribery scandal, firmed Y1 to Y445 on bargain hunting.
Overnight support of the high-technology sector on Wall Street encouraged
investors, and Sharp, the day's most active issue, moved up Y10 to Y1,380
and Matsushita Electric Industrial Y50 to Y1,320.
Communication issues were firm, the sector rising 1.33 per cent. Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone advanced Y12,000 to Y911,000 on reports that NTT
Data Communication, its subsidiary, will apply for listing.
Stocks with links to East Japan Railway were mixed. Tobu Railway climbed Y9
to Y866, but Nippon Express lost Y10 to Y1,040 on profit-taking.
Shiseido, the cosmetics maker, retreated Y30 to Y1,400 on reports that a
discount retailer will file an anti-monopoly complaint with the FTC against
the company's distribution units for cancellations of contracts.
In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 30.33 to 22,145.26 in volume of 23m
shares.
Roundup
PACIFIC Rim markets registered mixed performances, although some remained at
record high levels.
MANILA posted a second consecutive all-time peak in response to improved
market sentiment and the strong performance of Philippine Long Distance
Telephone both locally and on Wall Street. The composite index added 25.09,
or 1.5 per cent, at 1,706.95.
PLDT rose 40 pesos to 1,090 pesos after its Dollars 2 3/4 advance to Dollars
39 7/8 on Wall Street.
NEW ZEALAND saw a second consecutive three-year high, with the NZSE-40 index
3.44 ahead at 1,732.95, although forestry stocks eased back after their
recent strong run.
TAIPEI finished ahead, although off early highs, in response to small
deposit rate cuts by local banks. The weighted index ended 25.18 stronger at
3,932.15, after a day's high of 3,957.40.
HONG KONG was undermined by foreign selling by institutional investors
worried about the state of China's economy. The Hang Seng index receded
79.96, or 1.17 per cent, to 6,760.02.
AUSTRALIA traded lower as investors sold blue chips, and the All Ordinaries
index finished 15.9 down at 1,802.6. Futures-related trading, easing bullion
prices and a lack of overseas buying contributed to the softer market.
SEOUL was depressed by pessimism about the nation's economic prospects and a
liquidity shortage, which left the composite index 5.38 lower at 746.56.
BOMBAY was broadly higher on buying by financial institutions and
short-covering by speculators. The BSE index put on 38.05 at 2,161.37.
