FT  29 APR 94 / International Company News: Panama plans bond exchange


   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor


Panama, the one Latin American country which went into long-standing default
on its foreign bond issues during the 1980s, is set to complete a bond
exchange next month aimed at resolving the default.
Under the exchange, more than Dollars 400m of new floating-rate notes will
be issued by the government in place of nine bonds issued during the 1970s
and 1980s.
The new notes will carry interest at 1 per cent over London interbank
offered rates and will be redeemed in semi-annual instalments between 1996
and 2002, giving an average life of five years.
The exchange, for which the government was advised by S. G. Warburg, has
been accepted by bondholders representing 97 per cent of the outstanding
notes and bonds.
The move is the latest step by the current Panamanian government to right
the foreign debt defaults of the Noriega era. In a first step, the
government cleared Dollars 685m of arrears to the Paris Club of creditor
governments and the multilateral financial institutions in early 1992.
Talks with leading creditor banks over the settlement of some Dollars 1.9bn
of debt, with around Dollars 1bn of back interest, are continuing, though
they are likely to be put on hold at least until after presidential
elections on May 8.
The bond exchange - aimed at the creation of one liquid floating-rate note
issue which could conceivably act as a future benchmark - has only one
recent precedent in Latin America: the exchange in 1985 by Costa Rica of
three Eurobond issues.
The nine Panamanian bonds in default, which should all have matured by now,
include five US dollar issues totalling Dollars 195m, one issue of 20m
European units of account, the precursor to the Ecu, and three Japanese
issues totalling Y27m.
The accord includes a settlement totalling some Dollars 180m of interest
payments on both capital and interest outstanding. A quarter of this will be
paid initially in cash and the rest will be rolled into the bonds.
