FT  12 APR 94 / UK Company News: QS optimistic despite reduction to Pounds
5.25m


   By PEGGY HOLLINGER


QS Holdings, the discount retailer which saw its shares plunge by more than
20 per cent following a profits warning last July, was optimistic yesterday
in spite of a sharp fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 8.47m to Pounds
5.25m. The shares closed 7p lower at 228p.
Mr Marc Walters, chairman, said there had been a strong improvement in
second half sales, which was expected to continue into this year.
The first six months had been particularly difficult, with customers both
cautious and extremely value conscious. Margins had declined as a result.
Sales rose 14 per cent to Pounds 58.1m for the year to January 28. Some 14
new stores were opened, making a total of 99 including the two launched
since the year end. Mr Walters said this had been funded from cash
resources, which stood at a net Pounds 5.7m at the year-end.
'We will continue to pursue our plan for controlled expansion,' Mr Walters
said, 'aiming for further growth in retail sales.'
The final dividend is 3.63p for a maintained total of 5.19p. Earnings fell
from 14.22p to 8.49p.
