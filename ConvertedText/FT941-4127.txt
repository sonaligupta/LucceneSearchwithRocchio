FT  12 MAR 94 / International Company News: Metals group sheds Methanex
interest


   By BERNARD SIMON


   TORONTO


Metallgesellschaft, the troubled German metals and energy group, has sold
its remaining 6 per cent stake in Methanex, the world's biggest methanol
producer. The disposal is part of the group's drive to raise cash by
disposing of peripheral businesses.
Metallgesellschaft raised CDollars 127m (USDollars 94m) from its shares,
which were sold in a block trade on the Toronto stock exchange by a
syndicate of Canadian securities dealers led by Gordon Capital. A Gordon
official said the shares were widely distributed.
Until early last year, it had a 32 per cent controlling stake in Methanex,
which is based in Vancouver. However, it has gradually reduced its interest
over the past year.
Methanex's single biggest shareholder is now Nova, the Calgary-based
pipeline and chemicals group, with a 24 per cent interest. New Zealand's
Fletcher Challenge, which was a big shareholder in Methanex, also decided
last year to withdraw from the methanol business.
Metallgesellschaft is reviewing many of its investments as part of efforts
to recover from the huge losses suffered in international oil trading.
