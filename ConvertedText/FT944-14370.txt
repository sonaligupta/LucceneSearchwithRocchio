FT  24 OCT 94 / Sarajevo talks drag on

   SARAJEVO


The UN and Bosnia's Moslem-led government failed yesterday to forge a
security agreement for Sarajevo's key supply route, throwing into doubt a
Bosnian troop withdrawal from a violated demilitarised zone. At a meeting in
the Bosnian capital military negotiators agreed only to talk again today.
The Bosnian government has demanded the UN provide security for a road that
snakes down Mt Igman, west of Sarajevo, in full view of Bosnian Serb guns.
The road has come under fire from Bosnian Serb troops for months. Some
shooting has been from artillery even though a Security Council resolution,
backed by a threat of Nato air strikes, bans big guns from the area.
Resolution of this issue could determine how fast, or even whether Bosnian
government troops withdraw from a demilitarised zone behind Mt Igman.
The Bosnian government gave a commitment at the weekend to begin withdrawing
troops from the demilitarised zone at midday today and to complete the
process as quickly as possible, UN officials said. The security meeting
yesterday followed the apparent success of UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi
in persuading Serbs to lift from today a fuel blockade that has brought UN
operations in eastern Bosnian Moslem enclaves to a standstill.
