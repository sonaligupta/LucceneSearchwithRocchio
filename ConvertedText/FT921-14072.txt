FT  17 JAN 92 / Bush finalises plans for cutting taxes


   By GEORGE GRAHAM


   WASHINGTON


PRESIDENT George Bush is completing a package of tax cuts and economic
growth proposals to prod the US economy out of recession.
The White House is withholding details of the proposals until he unveils
them in his State of the Union speech on January 28 and in formal budget
presentations the next day.
However, several proposals likely to be included have emerged - many of them
measures that Mr Bush has already tried for in the past, such as a cut in
the capital gains tax.
Mr Bush said this week he wants to avoid 'quick fixes' and focus his
proposals on measures to stimulate investment and savings, not the
across-the-board income tax cuts Democratic congressional leaders have put
forward.
However, the administration is reported by the Washington Post to be
considering raising personal income tax allowances by as much as Dollars
1,000 (Pounds 560) per child - although other sources indicate a much
smaller rise - to give a Dollars 15bn-Dollars 17bn tax cut for families. The
advantage of this measure is that it would start trickling through
immediately as companies withheld less tax from employees' salaries.
Moderate price increases in December left US inflation at 3.1 per cent in
1991, its lowest rate for five years.
The Labour Department said yesterday its index of consumer prices rose by
0.1 per cent in December, or 0.3 per cent after seasonal adjustment.
The low inflation rate in 1991 was much helped by a 7.4 per cent drop in
energy prices (compared with an 18.1 per cent rise in 1990), but inflation
in almost all sectors stayed moderate. Food prices rose only 2.5 per cent,
their slowest advance since 1976.
The main exception was medical care, where prices rose by 7.9 per cent in
1991.
