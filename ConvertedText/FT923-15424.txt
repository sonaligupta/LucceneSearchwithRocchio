FT  02 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Defensive tactics rule as
bourses slide again


   By Our Markets Staff and HILARY BARNES


MOST bourses were weaker yesterday in uncertain trading, writes Our Markets
Staff.
Strategists said that the shift from cyclical to defensive stocks, tested in
London recently and apparent this week in continental Europe, was a tactical
ploy,
In Germany, said Mr Horst Greven of Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, the
cyclical/defensive move is a fact, but follows from people taking profits
where they can. Cyclicals have been the mainstay of the German equity
market's outperformance this year.
Mr Richard Davidson of Morgan Stanley in London says that, in general,
cyclicals have lost momentum for three additional reasons:
that European recovery is not coming through;
that interest rate cuts are not happening in Europe; and
that the dollar is on the slide.
Morgan Stanley offers an alternative strategy, in a 1990s prospect of
disinflation which Mr Davidson defines as 'manageable' inflation rates
between zero and 4 per cent as distinct from deflation, or a negative
percentage.
The bank says that the long-term outlook is a 3 to 3 1/2 per cent inflation
rate in Europe, and that the losers in this environment would be companies
which have relied on price increases to boost their revenues. The winners
would be those which could grow their revenues from volume and market share
gains, or those which could rationalise their cost structures to improve
profit margins.
This has some surprising results. A classic defensive industry, banking, is
split. Morgan Stanley's chief strategist, Mr David Roche, likes UK banking
which demonstrates that high variable cost companies (the service sector)
stand to gain from disinflation because they can cut the workforce and keep
labour costs low. However, he says, most continental European banks 'do not
seem to understand how to rationalise'.
FRANKFURT offered a limited extension of Tuesday's trend with falls in a
limited number of blue-chip cyclicals, and gains in defensive stocks.
The DAX index rose 3.63 to 1,756.26 after a gain of 1.72 to 695.33 in the
FAZ at midsession. Turnover eased from DM5.7bn to DM5.5bn.
Cyclical fallers included BMW in carmakers, down DM7.50 to DM582.50 as
Volkswagen recovered a little; Continental, the tyremaker, DM3 lower at
DM257; Degussa in basic materials, DM6.50 lower at DM338.50; and Linde in
engineering, down DM12.50 at DM819.
Among defensives, there was a DM12 gain to DM2,296 for Allianz, the insurer,
and one of DM3.20 to DM256.50 for Commerzbank. Utilities also improved, led
by Veba with a DM5 rise to DM339.50.
Among special situations, Asko said it would remain suspended today although
shareholders heard a lot of bad news yesterday, in heavy provisions against
investments, a 1991 loss and the omission of the dividend.
PARIS fell for the fourth successive day, but in derisory turnover of just
FFr1.6bn. Dealers feared that the market would remain depressed until the
referendum on the Maastricht treaty, which has been set for September 20.
The CAC 40 index ended down 19.71 at 1,880.92, its lowest close since
February 14.
LVMH fell FFr115 to FFr3,766 on news that turnover growth at its luggage
subsidiary Louis Vuitton had slowed in April and May and by a newspaper
report describing difficulties in the champagne sector.
Alcatel Alsthom, ex-dividend, was a net 50 centimes better at FFr636 while
Lafarge, also ex dividend, dropped a net FFr2 to FFr330.90.
MILAN fell for the sixth consecutive session as the Comit index closed 3.41
lower at 450.75, its lowest level since February 12, 1988.
The market's depression was deepened by Fiat chairman Giovanni Agnelli's
remarks to shareholders on Tuesday that he did not expect any substantial
recovery in the group's fortunes until late 1993. Fiat closed L73 down at
L5,215 and reached L5,135 later.
Kleinwort Benson this week added Italy to its list of 'buys', recommending
that long-term investors should start looking at it again. It says that the
market has failed to appreciate that attitudes have changed, for example,
that most of the old, and tainted, names have disappeared from government.
Among other stocks, Italgas recouped L7 to L2,790 after Tuesday's weakness
while Pirelli fell L33 to L1,256.
AMSTERDAM was undermined by the afternoon fall in London, as the General
Tendency index fell 1.0 to 122.6. Hoogovens lost another Fl 1.50 to Fl
47.80, for an 11 per cent fall since Friday. Fokker lost Fl 1.40 or 4.4 per
cent to Fl 30.30 although it denied a press report that a cash crisis was
holding up Fokker's planned partnership with Germany's Dasa.
MADRID sank to a second consecutive 1992 low, the general index losing
another 2.86 to close at 235.45. Volume was thin at less than Pta11bn.
Dealers were worried that yields could rise at the Spanish treasury's
multiple bond tender today. Constructions, again, and metals posted the
sharpest declines with Cubiertas Pta500 lower at Pta7,280 and Asturiana Del
Zinc Pta800, or 30 per cent lower, at Pta1,850.
OSLO fell 1.7 per cent to a new 1992 low, led down by the insurer UNI
Storebrand after a report that the company was close to technical
bankruptcy. The all-share index fell 7.07 to 395.97 in turnover worth
NKr572m. Most of the turnover was in Forenede options, after the Finance
Ministry gave Gjensidige permission to buy the company.
UNI Storebrand tumbled even though the company denied the report in the
business daily, Dagens Naeringliv. Its A shares closed NKr5.5 lower at
NKr31.
COPENHAGEN saw the suspension of Hafnia, at the request of the company
pending an investigation into irregularities concerning options to purchase
shares in a local bank, writes Hilary Barnes. The all-share index fell 1.09
to 320.26 in turnover of Dkr125m.
VIENNA fell to a five-month low, following weakness in the state-controlled
utility Verbund. The ATX index eased 7.02 to 935.11, the lowest since
January 14.
Verbund closed down Sch9 at Sch478 in active trade, while OMV slipped Sch7
to Sch867 after the government said that it would welcome Verbund taking a
20 per cent stake in the oil company OMV, itself 72 per cent owned by the
state. Austrian Airlines closed at a new low for the year of Sch2,049, down
Sch45.
ISTANBUL finished a volatile session, up for the eight straight day at a new
five-month high, although profit-taking erased most of a 146-point surge
which came in the first 15 minutes. The 75-share index closed at 4,442.60,
up 35.37 points and the highest since February 10.
