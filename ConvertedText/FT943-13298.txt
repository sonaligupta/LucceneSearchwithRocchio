FT  20 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Strong recovery at Victoria Carpet


Despite a decidedly cautious statement from the chairman, shares of Victoria
Carpet Holdings jumped 19p to 154p yesterday after the Kidderminster-based
group announced a strong profits recovery.
On turnover ahead to Pounds 36.7m (Pounds 33.5m), pre-tax profits for the
year to end-March amounted to Pounds 1.86m - a figure which compared with a
depressed Pounds 598,000 last time and Pounds 1.74m in 1991-92.
However, Mr John Bettinson, chairman, said that current conditions in the UK
remained 'as difficult as at any time during the current prolonged
recession'. There was a lack of confidence among consumers, he added, with
'consequent pressure on sales and margins'.
Earnings per share leapt from 5.28p to 18.62p and the single distribution is
raised 50 per cent to 4.5p.
