FT  22 OCT 94 / Gligorov remains at helm in Macedonia

President Kiro Gligorov of Macedonia has secured a new five-year term,
capturing 52.4 per cent of the registered vote in Sunday's presidential and
parliamentary elections, according to official results announced yesterday.
His opponent, Mr Ljubisha Georgievski, a theatre director backed by the
hardline nationalist Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Movement (VMRO), won
only 14.5 per cent of the vote.
Mr Gligorov, 77, a reformist ex-Yugoslav politician, campaigned on his
record of achieving a peaceful transition to independence and international
recognition.
However, a high percentage of spoiled ballot papers, many from districts
with a large ethnic Albanian population, indicated the tensions underlying
Macedonia's precarious political stability.
Official results of the first-round parliamentary vote were still
unavailable yesterday. The state electoral commission, in charge of election
procedures, said it was unable to produce full results as returns from some
polling stations were missing and electoral registers were incomplete.
The Alliance for Macedonia, led by ex-communists and backed by President
Gligorov, claimed it won more than 30 per cent of the vote. Unofficial
results gave VMRO about 13 per cent and the free-market nationalist
Democratic party about 10 per cent.
The Alliance said it captured 12 of the 120 parliamentary seats in the first
round. The Party for Democratic Prosperity, the main ethnic Albanian party,
claimed two seats.
Because of the confusion surrounding the poll, both VMRO and the Democratic
party are threatening to boycott the run-off vote for parliament, set for
October 30.
