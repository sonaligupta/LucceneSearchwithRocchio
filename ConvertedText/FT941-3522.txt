FT  16 MAR 94 / Best-selling trust to suffer yield cut


   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR, Personal Finance Editor


A group offering a 10 per cent return on its best-selling trust has warned
70,000 investors that it will cut the yield to 9 per cent from June 28.
The high-income unit trust offered by fund manager Foreign & Colonial has
pulled in more than Pounds 500m since its launch just over a year ago.
It was particularly attractive to income seekers and heavily promoted by
many financial intermediaries because of the 10 per cent yield.
Such funds, which obtain an unusually high income, have been highly
controversial because they can procure such high returns only at the expense
of the capital growth prospects.
Many experts believe savers' capital could actually be eroded in order to
keep the income flowing.
Over the past year, anyone investing in the F&C fund would have lost roughly
10 per cent of their initial investment - neatly cancelling out the benefit
of the 10 per cent income. Most conventional equity income funds have
produced a significantly better return.
Mr Simon James, F&C director, said the decision to cut the target yield on
the fund was mainly because the group expects interest rates to move lower
this year. He added that the group also wants to give investors plenty of
notice of the impending cut in yield.
F&C has also trimmed its management charge from 1.5 per cent to 1.25 per
cent with effect from April 6.
