FT  25 MAR 92 / Ukraine approves separate currency plan


   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND


   KIEV


AN ECONOMIC plan calling for the rapid introduction of a separate Ukrainian
currency, as a means to break economic ties with Russia, was approved in
principle by a wide majority of the Ukrainian parliament yesterday.
However, deputies refused to endorse details of the plan, which they said
were poorly thought out.
The decision ended a day of fierce debate in a closed session of parliament,
which pitted nationalists and ex-communists against reformers.
Mr Oleksandr Iemelianov, author of the plan, ex-communist and a leading
economic policy-maker, told parliament Ukraine could introduce a separate
currency at three days' notice and must be prepared to leave the rouble zone
the moment Russia liberalised prices for its oil.
Mr Oleksandr Sharov, a government economist and among the reformers,
described Mr Iemelianov's claim as 'fantastical'. A deputy from the New
Ukraine liberal pro-reform group described the plan as 'national communism'
and Mr Volodymyr Hryniov, parliamentary deputy chairman and a reformer,
called the compromise decision 'very dangerous because it is not now clear
what the president will do or who will implement the programme. 'If this
programme is realised, it will be the equivalent of leaving the Commonwealth
of Independent States,' Mr Hryniov said.
Mr Viacheslav Chornovil, nationalist western Ukrainian leader, backed the
programme because to remain in the Russian monetary system would mean
'Russia suffocating us.'
Meanwhile, Mr Vadim Hetman was appointed as head of the Ukrainian National
Bank. His predecessor, Mr Volodymyr Matvienko, had been criticised for
dragging his feet in the introduction of a separate currency.
Mr Hetman emphasised that a separate currency could only be introduced in
co-operation with Russia. and called for 'constructive dialogue'.
