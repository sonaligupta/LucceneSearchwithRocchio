FT  12 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Wrong line on wages


   From Mr BARRY LEATHWOOD


Sir, Your leader, 'The last board' (April 8), suggests a substitute
mechanism for the Agricultural Wages Board which could be enforced by
ejection from the National Farmers Union. The NFU has enough trouble keeping
its own membership and certainly would be in no position to discipline those
who do not toe the line.
You also suggest it would be unfair for the workers to feel the pain of
deregulation before the farmers have to take the medicine and, in doing so,
assume there is equity between them.
Thousands of workers and their families live on the margins of poverty, many
in tied cottages in isolated areas, while their employers receive subsidies
from the public purse greater than the total wage bill. Where is the equity
here?
More than 99.7 per cent of those consulted by the government, including
employers, called for the retention of the boards. Surely it makes more
sense to retain a system which, though not perfect, is supported by both
sides of industry.
