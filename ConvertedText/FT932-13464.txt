FT  23 APR 93 / Shetland shipping scheme defended


THE DEPARTMENT of Transport yesterday defended its plan for a traffic
separation scheme off Shetland.
Lord Donaldson, the former master of the rolls who is chairing the Braer
disaster inquiry, accused it of designing the marine equivalent of a
'dual-carriageway highway' when an ordinary road would have been sufficient.
Mr Robin Bradley, the department's surveyor-general, said a simple sea-lane
would risk causing tanker collisions.
