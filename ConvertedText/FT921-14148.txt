FT  17 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Restructuring hits Norbain Electronics


The restructuring at Norbain Electronics, aimed at focusing on the security
market, affected the performance in the half year to October 31 1991.
Sales fell 29 per cent to Pounds 5.75m (Pounds 8.14m) while pre-tax profit
slumped 84 per cent to Pounds 33,000 (Pounds 205,000). Earnings per share
came to 0.33p (2.06p).
The results reflected the disposal of the Technology division and an
increase in bad debts.
Despite difficult trading conditions turnover for the remaining security
business remained level with last year.
The improvement in the underlying sales trend, together with an estimated
temporary decrease in the CCTV market size of 15 per cent, meant the group
had substantially increased market penetration and turnover for its core
security business. Gross margins were being maintained.
