FT  15 DEC 94 / Karadzic offers new Bosnian plan


   By REUTER


   NEW YORK


Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic yesterday offered a six-point Bosnia
peace plan which would include giving up some territory, releasing UN
prisoners and allowing UN convoys to move unhindered, Reuter reports from
New York.
UN officials said Mr Karadzic's proposals were precisely those put to him by
Mr Yasushi Akashi, the UN special envoy in the Balkans. Mr Akashi said
earlier he had won no commitment from Bosnian Serbs on a ceasefire. Former
US President Jimmy Carter held out the possibility he would go to Bosnia.
