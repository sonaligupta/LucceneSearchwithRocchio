FT  20 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Early debate on procedure reform


THE prime minister yesterday reaffirmed his commitment to reforming the
procedures and hours of Commons sittings.
He told the House the government planned an early debate on a report from a
Commons select committee which proposes a radical shake-up MPs' working
practices, drastically curtailing the number of very late night sittings.
Mr Major said: 'My personal belief is that this House does need reform of
its procedures and I hope we will be able to proceed to it as speedily as
possible.'
