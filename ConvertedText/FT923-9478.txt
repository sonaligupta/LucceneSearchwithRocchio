FT  05 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: A Royal misfortune


It is difficult to resist a gasp of apprehension at the sheer size of the
Pounds 418m claim against Royal Bank of Scotland from the liquidators of
Wallace Smith Trust. The sum is not only broadly equivalent to a whole
year's profit before provisions. It also amounts to a quarter of the bank's
shareholders' funds.
Uncertainty about the suit will dog the bank for a long time. One can only
guess at the outcome, but the chances are that Royal will not in the end
have to write off the full amount. A further consolation is that the bank is
well endowed with tier 1 capital under Bank for International Settlements
rules. Its BIS ratio at the end of the last business year was nearly 7 per
cent and it is currently adding new tier 1 capital through its Dollars 200m
issue of non-cumulative preference shares in the US.
A more serious worry in the short run is the warning in the US issue
documentation that provisions will exceed last year's Pounds 351m, a figure
which was already 80 per cent up on the previous year. It looks as though
the bank has been less than usually canny in its forays into English
lending. Its admission is especially disconcerting after its encouraging
noises at the interim stage. That alone would be enough to justify a large
part of yesterday's 12 per cent fall in the shares.
