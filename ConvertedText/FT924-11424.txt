FT  26 OCT 92 / International Company News: Heseltine accepts AAH
undertakings


   By PETER PEARSE


MR Michael Heseltine, the president of the Board of Trade, has accepted
undertakings from AAH Holdings, the pharmaceuticals wholesaler, that it will
abide by 'protective measures' until the end of March 1993 to safeguard 'new
entry' into its market in the Grampian and Highland region of Scotland.
He had originally found that AAH's acquisition of the UK business of
Medicopharma, the Dutch pharmaceuticals wholesaler which withdrew from the
UK market in November 1991, had stifled competition in that region, though
not nationally. He had recommended that AAH divest the acquired warehouse in
Aberdeen.
However since Norscot Pharmaceuticals, the core of which is the management
of Medicopharma's Aberdeen branch, entered the mar-ket at the beginning of
April, Mr Heseltine has accepted that it is no longer necess-ary for AAH to
proceed with the divestment, merely with the protective meas-ures.
Mr George Berry, managing director of Norscot, said he was mildly surprised
by the decision, but not worried by it. In the Pounds 50m regional market,
Norscot was on schedule for about Pounds 15m turnover in its first year.
