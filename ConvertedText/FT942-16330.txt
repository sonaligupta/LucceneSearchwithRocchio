FT  11 APR 94 / UK Company News: Hays buys Rockall Scotia Resources


   By DAVID WIGHTON


Hays, the business services group, is paying Pounds 20m for Rockall Scotia
Resources, a records storage and data management company primarily serving
the oil exploration industry.
The deal will make Hays the market leader in oil records storage ahead of
British Data Management.
In 1993 it had turnover of Pounds 15.4m, nearly half of which was generated
overseas, and made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 2.1m.
In addition to its oil industry business, Rockall has been expanding into
local government and healthcare markets, and has a large contract with the
Inland Revenue.
Mr Ronnie Frost, Hays chairman, said the combined business would be well
placed to take advantage of the government's policy of contracting out
services such as data storage. 'Rockall's successful overseas subsidiaries
will also provide Hays with a springboard from which to expand its records
management services overseas.'
