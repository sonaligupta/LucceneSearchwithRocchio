FT  19 MAY 92 / Another Taurus delay


   By RICHARD WATERS


A FURTHER delay in the launch of Taurus, the long-awaited paperless
settlement system for the London stock market, seems likely after a failure
to meet the current development timetable, Richard Waters writes.
The project, originally scheduled for last autumn, is now planned for next
April, but it is thought likely to fall behind again.
The latest hitch is in the development by IBM of a system to protect the
network from 'hackers' who could falsify share bargains.
