FT  11 NOV 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report


   By REUTER


THE METAL prices improved across the board on the LME as the market staged
corrective technical rallies after the recent sustained falls. Dealers said
many markets had become oversold, and were susceptible to a correction,
especially as there were some falls in warehouse stocks. 'Nothing goes down
in a straight line forever,' one said. But for rallies to be maintained, the
markets would need some fresh fundamental stimulus. London COCOA prices
closed just below a fresh nine-month high, boosted by a short covering rally
in New York and sterling weakness. The market was also aided by some signs
of buying interest from the industry, while producers appeared to have
returned to the sidelines after sales late last week. New York's arabica
COFFEE market was firmer on short covering after the recent falls. 'We
exacerbated the move to the downside,' said one analyst, adding that
fundamental news would be needed to take the prices back towards 70 cents.
