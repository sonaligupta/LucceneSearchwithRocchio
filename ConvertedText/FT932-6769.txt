FT  27 MAY 93 / Water privatisation benefits overstated


   By BRONWEN MADDOX


THE economic benefits of water privatisation may have been overstated,
according to a paper published today by the Institute for Fiscal Studies,
Bronwen Maddox writes.
The paper, by Mr Ted Lynk of the University of Swansea, argues that the
industry in England and Wales may have lost some efficiency when
water-quality monitoring was transferred to the National Rivers Authority.
Comparing efficiency in the 10 large water and sewerage authorities before
they were privatised in 1989 with that in the smaller, privately owned
statutory companies, the paper says: 'The average levels of inefficiency,
relative to potential efficiency, were lowest in the public sector.'
Since privatisation, the public companies have cut costs and staff levels
considerably and improved efficiency further. Ofwat, the regulator, has said
it will take efficiency into account in next year's review.
The institute says geography 'is an important determinant of operating
costs' as flat regions have much higher pumping costs than hilly ones.
