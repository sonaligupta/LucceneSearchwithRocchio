FT  19 MAY 92 / High bids for Welsh ceramics: Saleroom


   By ANTONY THORNCROFT


SOTHEBY'S has disposed of the finest collection of Welsh ceramics to appear
on the market. It was assembled by the late Sir Leslie Joseph, for many
years vice-chairman of Trusthouse Forte. The sale was held at Margam Park
near Port Talbot and the 900 lots brought in Pounds 1.12m, far above the
Pounds 750,000 estimate. Virtually everything sold.
There was strong local buying and Michael Heseltine, Swansea-born trade and
industry secretary, was believed to be among the successful bidders. The
National Museum of Wales, which is establishing a Welsh ceramics gallery
this year, spent more than Pounds 90,000 and Swansea City Council Pounds
27,000.
The top price was Pounds 15,400 that secured a pair of candlesticks
decorated with wild flowers, made at the Swansea factory between 1814 and
1826. It was a record for Welsh porcelain. A fruit basket of the same period
realised the same sum. The short-lived Swansea factory is regarded as having
produced soft-paste porcelain equal in quality to that created at Sevres.
There was also a record price of Pounds 9,350, paid by the US dealer Jim
Maben, for porcelain produced at the same time at the Nantgarw factory. This
consisted of a trio of pieces decorated with a floral bouquet.
Other high prices were the Pounds 13,200 for a Swansea tureen and cover  -
an identical tureen is in the Queen's collection - and Pounds 12,100 paid by
the National Museum of Wales, for an ice pail, cover and liner.
Christie's yesterday sold British ceramics for Pounds 234,916, with 86 per
cent sold. The top price was the Pounds 10,450, double the estimate, for a
pair of Bristol hexagonal tapering vases and covers made at Richard
Champion's factory about 1775.
A Bow group depicting The Fortune Teller, by the Muses Modeller, sold just
on target at Pounds 9,900. In 1986 at Sotheby's, as part of the famous Rous
Lench auction, it made Pounds 13,200, underlining just how lacklustre demand
for British ceramics has been in recent years.
