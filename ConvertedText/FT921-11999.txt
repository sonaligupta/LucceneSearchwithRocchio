FT  29 JAN 92 / International Company News: Allstate to sell Canadian
operations


   By BARBARA DURR


   CHICAGO


ALLSTATE Insurance, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sears, Roebuck, the US
retail and financial services conglomerate, plans to sell its Canadian
operations, which include property/casualty and life insurance lines.
Allstate Insurance Company of Canada, based in Markham, Ontario, represents
less than 4 per cent of Allstate's consolidated operations, but it is
considered among the top 10 personal insurers in Canada.
The move appeared to reflect Sears, Roebuck's continuing effort to
restructure and focus its capital. This month it agreed to sell a small
stake, worth about Dollars 52.4m, in Seiyu, the Japanese supermarket chain
operator.
Mr Ray Kiefer, president of Allstate Insurance and chairman of Allstate
Insurance Company of Canada, said: 'The move is in no way reflective of the
financial results of the Canadian operation, which has just completed one of
its most successful financial years.' Sears' overall results for 1991 are
due in the next few weeks.
Mr Kiefer said the company intended to seek 'successful new owners.' The
Canadian company may sell its commercial division to concentrate on the
property/casualty and life markets.
