ABB is teaming up with Nevsky Zavod, a big Russian manufacturer of gas and
steam turbines, to form ABB Nevsky, which will be 80 per cent owned by ABB
and 20 per cent by its Russian partner. ABB Nevsky will be producing
complete gas turbines based on ABB's latest advanced technology. These will
be used to modernise old power stations in Russia.
