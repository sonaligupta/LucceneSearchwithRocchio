FT  13 APR 94 / US inflationary pressure subdued


   By MICHAEL PROWSE


   WASHINGTON


US producer prices for finished goods rose 0.2 per cent last month,
indicating that inflationary pressures at the wholesale level remain fairly
subdued, the Labour Department reported yesterday.
The increase excluding the volatile components of food and energy was also
0.2 per cent, in line with analysts' projections.
However, price indices for goods at an earlier stage of production were less
subdued, reflecting recent increases in commodity prices. The producer price
index for crude materials rose 2.8 per cent last month, following a 1.3 per
cent decline in February. Increases in the crude materials index tend to lag
increases in finished goods prices.
For the year to March prices for finished and crude goods were up 0.2 per
cent and 2.1 per cent respectively.
