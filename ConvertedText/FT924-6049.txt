FT  24 NOV 92 / French famers protest against EC-US trade deal


A French farmer throws a Union flag on to burning straw in front of a police
station to protest against last Friday's EC-US trade deal. About 100 farmers
took part in the protest in the northern French town of Valenciennes. At
Grigny, southern Paris, about 300 farmers demonstrated outside a Coca-Cola
plant where they halted production and burned tyres beside a Coca-Cola
symbol. A nationwide protest against the trade deal is planned for tomorrow.
