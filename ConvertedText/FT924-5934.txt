FT  24 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Allen shows 58% decline to Pounds 855,000


   By MATTHEW CURTIN


Allen, the Wigan-based construction and property development group, bore the
brunt of the depressed property market and building business in the
half-year to September, turning in a 58 per cent fall in pre-tax profit from
Pounds 2.01m to Pounds 855,000.
Mr Donald Greenhalgh, chairman and managing director, said he was confident
1992-93 would prove to be the 'bottom of the cycle' in the construction
industry.
Although the industry could take heart from lower interest rates and other
measures announced in the Autumn Statement, consumer confidence would be the
key factor in any recovery in house sales and property prices, he stressed.
Turnover from the contracting, plant hire, housebuilding and property
development divisions, whose operations were concentrated in the north-west,
fell 20 per cent to Pounds 25.1m (Pounds 31.4m).
The downturn knocked margins, and operating profit fell to Pounds 1.38m
(Pounds 2.44m).
Mr Greenhalgh said margins from houses, which contributed half of the
operating profit, fell to 12 per cent compared with 13.1 per cent last year,
and 16.7 per cent in 1990-91.
He added that the group did not need to make any provisions against the
value of its land bank - which at Pounds 11,000 per plot was valued at a
significant discount to the main competitors - because of its cautious
approach to buying land in the past.
Earnings per share declined from 5.9p to 2.5p.
An unchanged interim dividend of 1.65p is declared and the directors expect
to maintain the final at 3.35p.
