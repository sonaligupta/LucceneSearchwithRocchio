FT  06 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: National Power


National Power, the electricity generator, opens the electricity interim
results season on Wednesday with analysts as eager to hear the company's
latest market share expectations as its profits.
Profits are fairly meaningless for the first half of the year which usually
generates only 30 to 40 per cent of the full year earnings. The figure is
likely to be around Pounds 210m to Pounds 220m, against Pounds 201m for the
first half of last year.
