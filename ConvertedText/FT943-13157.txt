FT  21 JUL 94 / International Company News: Posco move to thwart Hyundai

Pohang Iron and Steel, South Korea's dominant steel company, yesterday
announced plans to expand its production capacity in an attempt to block the
Hyundai group from entering the steel sector.
The increase in Posco's annual production capacity by 5.9m tonnes to 28m
tonnes would cover any predicted shortfall in steel supplies in the next
decade and deprive Hyundai of its justification for starting the production
of cold-rolled coils.
The expansion of Posco's facilities would be completed by 1999 at a cost of
Won15,000bn (Dollars 18bn).
Hyundai this week announced its long-term plans to build, by the year 2001
at a cost of Won7,700bn, steel facilities to produce 9.3m tonnes a year.
The government and state-owned Posco oppose the move, saying that the
Hyundai facilities would result in a glut in steel supplies. However,
Hyundai believes South Korea will face a significant shortage of steel in
the next decade.
Posco fears that Hyundai's steel production would cause a price war.
