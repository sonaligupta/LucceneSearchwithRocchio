FT  08 NOV 94 / UK official to visit Burma


   By REUTER


   LONDON


Britain said yesterday a senior Foreign Office official would arrive in
Burma today for talks with the ruling military government. A Foreign Office
spokesman said the visit, the first by a senior British official since the
Burmese elections of 1990, accorded with the European Union policy of
'critical dialogue' with the Rangoon government. The visit by Mr David Dain,
an assistant under-secretary of state, followed some 'potentially
encouraging' signals from the government, including meetings with the
detained opposition leader, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.
