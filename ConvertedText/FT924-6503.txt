FT  20 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Blue Circle


Blue Circle's June rights issue and the accompanying purchase of French
boilermaker Celsius now look to have been badly timed. The shares stand at a
25 per cent discount to the ex-rights price. Yesterday's announcement of a
15 per cent reduction in the company's cement manufacturing capacity,
however, looks to be the right decision. Given the surfeit of houses and
offices washed up by the building binge of the late 1980s, the chances of
general economic recovery feeding through to construction in the next year
or so remain remote.
Blue Circle's action goes some way towards restoring the cement market's
equilibrium while leaving a little slack for an upturn when it comes; it
also improves the chance that next year's dividend will be maintained.
Investors, though, may not be ready to give the new managing director the
benefit of the doubt just yet. Yesterday's development may be better news
for Rugby.
