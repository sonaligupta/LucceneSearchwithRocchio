FT  17 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Chartwell makes just Pounds 41,000


Chartwell Group, a maker of floor coverings, suffered from deteriorating
trading conditions and saw turnover fall from Pounds 8.24m to Pounds 6.09m
and pre-tax profit from Pounds 564,000 to Pounds 41,000 in the half-year
ended September 30 1991.
The results include sales of Pounds 1.49m and losses of Pounds 51,000
attributable to Plasmarc, which has since been sold for Pounds 675,000.
Directors said the disappointing results stemmed from the recession in
general and the severe slump in the construction industry. There was little
sign of recovery, they added.
Earnings per share amounted to 0.4p (5.9p).
