JAPAN'S current account surplus rose 24.9 per cent to Dollars 11.8bn in
July, the 28th consecutive month of year-on-year increases, highlighting the
pressure on the new coalition government to stimulate domestic demand in the
hope of reducing the surplus.
The continuing expansion of the surplus comes as the Bank of Japan is
apparently considering a reduction in the official discount rate (ODR) from
the present 2.5 per cent, if only to bolster the confidence of consumers and
Japanese companies, which are cutting capital investment this year.
Rumours of an ODR cut next week circulated in financial markets yesterday,
following a comment by Mr Yasushi Mieno, the Bank of Japan governor, that a
rate reduction was not needed to halt yen appreciation. Some brokers
interpreted his choice of words as a sign that a cut may be needed to
stimulate the economy.
In July, the surplus in Japan's trade account rose 22.3 per cent to Dollars
13.89bn (Pounds 9.10bn), and the finance ministry blamed the increase on the
yen's strength during the month. Seasonally adjusted, the current account
surplus rose from Dollars 8.9bn in June to Dollars 11.2bn in July.
The long-term capital account showed a deficit of Dollars 4.4bn, compared to
a surplus of Dollars 260m in the same month last year, while the overall
balance of payments had a surplus of Dollars 5.2bn, against a surplus of
Dollars 8.5bn a year earlier.
Japanese investors were net purchasers of Dollars 1.38bn in foreign shares,
compared to Dollars 1.24bn in the previous month, while they were sellers of
Dollars 692m in foreign bonds, compared to net sales of Dollars 3.04bn in
June.
