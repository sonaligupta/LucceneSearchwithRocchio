FT  08 NOV 94 / Observer: Trotted out


Britain's bookies must be quaking in their boots. Robin Chater, a
45-year-old number-cruncher who runs Wantage-based Racing Sciences, believes
he can spot likely winners in National Hunt races by subjecting the
offspring of 30 sires to advanced statistical analysis. If punters had
followed his recommendations, he claims they could easily have outperformed
the stock market over the past year.
Chater, whose unlikely form includes editing the National Child Care
directory, stumbled on his discovery when he was analysing his first love -
trotting races. When bookmakers started not to show up at those races he
sensed that he was on to a winner and decided to widen his field.
He picked National Hunt rather than flat racing because his theories worked
better. Among his many finds is one stallion whose progeny produces a return
of over 100 per cent on right-handed tracks but loses a bundle on left-hand
tracks. Punters wanting to test Chater's form should call him on 01235
771707 (no bookmakers, please).
