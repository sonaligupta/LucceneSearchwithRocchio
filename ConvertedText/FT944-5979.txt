FT  01 DEC 94 / Consumers' group attacks Barclays, NatWest, Midland


   By ALISON SMITH


Three of the four main high street banks were today accused by the
Consumers' Association of providing worse services than other banks and
building societies, Alison Smith writes.
On the basis of almost 4,000 replies from readers of Which? magazine, the
association found that Barclays Bank, National Westminster Bank and Midland
Bank achieved the lowest scores for overall customer satisfaction.
The British Bankers' Association challenged some of the findings. It said
that separate polling undertaken by MORI showed customers reporting fewer
difficulties than in the Which? survey.
