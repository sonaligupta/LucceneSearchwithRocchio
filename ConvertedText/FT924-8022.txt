FT  13 NOV 92 / Arts: Today's Television


   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY


The British tabloid press is accused of treating the royal family
destructively. But is television's attitude really healthier? You certainly
know what to expect: sycophancy first, last and always is the TV rule
because television needs co-operation from the royals to get access for its
equipment. Hence years of bowing and scraping whatever the royal subject.
Royal Gardens continues the tradition; the only hints of criticism are
directed at the dead. The final episode (8.30 BBC2) features Prince Charles'
garden at Highgrove, 'One of the most important gardens laid out in the
1980s in this country'. Well of course, bow, scrape, bow.
Alison Steadman stars in a second series under the title Gone To Seed (8.00
ITV). However, while title, stars, and social setting - parvenu Londoners -
remain, the characters and their relationships have been changed. Warren
Clarke, Jim Broadbent and Steadman now play triplets.
Those who have never seen Renoir's classic 1937 war movie La Grande Illusion
should watch it for the first time (11.20 BBC2). Everyone else should watch
it again.
