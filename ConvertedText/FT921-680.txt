FT  27 MAR 92 / Law Lords uphold TV franchise decision


   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent


TELEVISION South West lost its broadcast licence in last October's
independent television franchise auction because its revenue projections and
proposed cost structure left little room to manoeuvre if trading proved
worse than expected, the Law Lords ruled yesterday.
They said that the Independent Television Commission was entitled to
conclude that TSW would be unable to maintain a quality service over 10
years. It had done so after considering TSW's application and in particular
its forecasts of revenue, costs and profitability, and the size of its bid.
Having concluded that TSW's revenue projections were 'extremely optimistic',
the commission was bound to reject TSW's application, the Law Lords said.
They were giving their reasons for rejecting TSW's application for judicial
review of the commission's decision to award the licence for south-west
England to Westcountry Television, which bid Pounds 7.8m against TSW's
Pounds 16.1m.
TSW argued that the decision was based on an assessment of its bid that
failed to present a fair or accurate picture of its application.
That argument was fatally flawed, Lord Goff said, because it confused the
function of the commission with that of staff employed to advise it.
TSW's attack on the assessment paper was an attack not on the commission's
procedure but simply an attack on the contents of one paper prepared by
staff for the commission to consider.
Lord Goff said TSW's complaint was therefore misconceived because it failed
to focus on the relevant decision, which was that of the commission.
There was no scope for the courts to interfere with the commission's
decision in view of evidence from the commission itself.
