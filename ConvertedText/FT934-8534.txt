FT  15 NOV 93 / European telecoms lay down lines of defence: Project
Atlantic


   By ANDREW ADONIS, JOHN RIDDING and ARIANE GENILLARD


The international telecommunications industry is buzzing over Project
Atlantic, the putative alliance between France Telecom, Deutsche Telekom and
American Telephone and Telegraph, the world's three largest operators.
If it comes to fruition, a draft agreement to merge all but the domestic
voice businesses of the French and German state carriers and bring them into
AT&T's international 'Worldsource' venture would constitute potentially the
biggest telecoms deal in history. This summer's Dollars 5.3bn (Pounds 3.5bn)
partnership between British Telecommunications and MCI, the second largest
US carrier, is Lilliputian by comparison.
The deal would have a long haul through the European Commission. BT's will
not be the only voice crying foul on competition grounds - though some in
the Commission's telecommunications directorate, as petrified as France
Telecom and Deutsche Telekom at the long-term threat posed by AT&T, might
see a defensive case for the arrangement.
However, Project Atlantic is simply the most graphic illustration yet of
three trends sweeping Europe's public telecommunications operators (PTOs):
the discarding of utility traditions; the search for alliances; and the
passion to crown them with an American partnership.
The UK is the most advanced on all three fronts. Privatised in 1984, BT has
been shedding staff, acting abroad in an aggressively entrepreneurial
fashion, and engaging in foreign acquisitions. Its alliance with MCI is the
latest and biggest such venture.
Europe's smaller PTOs are following suit. A number - led by the Danish and
Netherlands PTOs - are on the privatisation trail. Telecom Netherlands last
week announced a strategic partnership with Telkom Indonesia, extending the
Dutch operator's base in the fast-growing Asia-Pacific region.
Meanwhile, the Swiss, Swedish and Dutch PTOs have formed their own
outsourcing company - 'Unisource' - which has an alliance with Sprint, the
third-largest US long-distance carrier. Telefonica, the Spanish
semi-state-owned operator, is in talks about joining.
Although they follow the same trends, the activities of the French and
German PTOs are not motivated by identical pressures. While Deutsche Telekom
is set for privatisation in 1996, France Telecom is not on the Balladur
government's sell-off list of 21 publicly owned groups.
The French PTO is flush with cash, operating arguably Europe's most advanced
network. Its German counterpart is weighed down by the investment demands of
eastern Germany, and is anxious for private capital.
Nonetheless, both are acting more entrepreneurially and are concerned at the
threat of foreign competition. Both are making aggressive moves abroad -
ironically they are heading rival consortia bidding for stakes in Matav, the
Hungarian state operator to be privatised this autumn. For offensive and
defensive reasons, both are keen to strengthen their existing outsourcing
venture Eunetcom.
Deutsche Telekom has been in the limelight this year because of its
privatisation plans and a succession of ventures in the former Soviet bloc.
It has signed a memorandum of understanding with Intertelekom, the Russian
state-owned long-distance operator, to modernise crumbling telecoms
infrastructure. In the Ukraine, DT has formed a joint venture called Utel
with AT&T, PTT Netherlands and the national operator to build a basic
telecoms network, and it has teamed up with PTT Netherlands and the Danish
PTO to develop a mobile phone network.
France Telecom has been less visible abroad, but it would be wrong to
consign it to the back seat of any tripartite venture. With annual sales in
excess of FFr120bn (Pounds 14bn) and a monopoly in most markets, it has a
stronger domestic base than BT.
More than 80 per cent of France Telecom's network is now digitalised, and
neither the UK nor Germany has anything to match its Minitel screen-based
information service.
France Telecom, too, has been stepping abroad. In the past month it has
signed a series of agreements including an accord with Rostelecom, the
Russian telecommunications operator, to develop a range of telephone
services.
The French operator and its political masters have made no secret of their
desire for an alliance with Deutsche Telekom. Mr Gerard Longuet, the French
industry, post and telecommunications minister, describes DT as 'a natural
partner'.
To give the operator a sharper competitive edge, Mr Longuet is preparing to
change its status from an 'autonomous operator under public law' into a
joint stock company able to form cross-shareholdings with other telecoms
groups.
If Project Atlantic has its entrepreneurial side, it is at least as much a
defensive ploy. Both the French and the German operators fear an assault on
their lucrative international businesses. Far better, say senior executives,
to work in partnership with AT&T before the 1998 Brussels deadline for
competition in voice services, particularly if the BT/MCI alliance makes
inroads.
Furthermore, both groups are sensitive to their weaknesses in facing head-on
competition. DT has the more obvious problems, given its staffing levels and
the protected civil service status of most of its employees. France Telecom
has an uneasy relationship with its unions. A strike last month demonstrated
the depth of concerns and the scale of the obstacles to reform.
AT&T's motivation in Project Atlantic is obvious. It needs a credible
European partner for its Worldsource venture, and it cannot gain direct
access to the European market until 1998.
