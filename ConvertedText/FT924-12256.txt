FT  21 OCT 92 / International Company News: Randcoal misses forecast


   By PHILIP GAWITH


RANDCOAL, the South African coal-mining group, raised sales and profits in
the year to September, but contrary to its April forecast, second-half
profits did not match those of the first, writes Philip Gawith. Turnover
rose 30 per cent to R1.62bn (Dollars 560m) from R1.24bn, and operating
profits advanced rose 22 per cent to R306.8m from R251.9m.
