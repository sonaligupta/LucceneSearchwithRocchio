FT  29 OCT 93 / International Company News: Unexpected advance at Xerox


   By KAREN ZAGOR


   NEW YORK


XEROX, the US document processing group which has consistently disappointed
Wall Street this year with its earnings performance, yesterday unveiled an
unexpected improvement in third-quarter earnings.
The news spurred active trading in Xerox shares, which climbed Dollars 5 to
Dollars 75 5/8 at mid-session.
Net income for the three months to September 30 rose 25 per cent to Dollars
150m, or Dollars 1.28 a primary share from Dollars 121m, or Dollars 1.07 the
previous year. Revenues were flat at Dollars 3.59bn.
Income from the core document processing business included a one-time tax
credit of Dollars 23m, or 22 cents which contributed to the unit's profits
of Dollars 148m, or Dollars 1.26 in the quarter. In the same period of last
year, Xerox earned Dollars 119m or Dollars 1.05 from document processing.
Stripping out the extraordinary gain, earnings from the business grew 6 per
cent in the latest quarter.
Mr Paul Allaire, chairman and chief executive, said equipment sales
increased in the third quarter after two quarters of decline. 'The increased
sales in part reflected benefits from the realignment of the US sales force
earlier this year and recent black-and-white copier introductions,' he said.
The disruption wrought by Xerox's unexpectedly lengthy reorganisation of its
sales force contributed to the company's poor performance earlier this year.
Looking ahead, Mr Allaire expects earnings to remain under pressure from
competitive pricing, a strong dollar and the economic environments in Europe
and Brazil.
For the first nine months, earnings from document processing rose to Dollars
384m, including a one-time Brazilian tax credit of Dollars 17m, compared
with Dollars 346m a year ago.
Net income for the first nine months was Dollars 451m or Dollars 4.01 a
share. A year earlier, Xerox posted a loss of Dollars 284m, or Dollars 3.49
including a special charge of Dollars 764m for accounting changes. Revenues
slipped to Dollars 10.42bn from Dollars 10.46bn.
