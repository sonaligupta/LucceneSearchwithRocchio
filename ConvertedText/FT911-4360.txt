FT  19 APR 91 / Iran returns Saddam to hate list after experiment with
politeness


   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU


SADDAM Hussein has changed from a president into a wolf in the Iranian
lexicon.
The restrained politeness accorded to the Iraqi leader last year by Iran
after he capitulated to Iran's main demands to end the Iran-Iraq war has
been all but abandoned, signalling a return to the friction that
traditionally characterises relations between the two.
The careful neutrality that Iran nurtured while the American-led coalition
was bombing Iraq has turned into scantily-veiled calls for President Saddam
Hussein's overthrow. Last month, President Hashemi-Rafsanjani called on the
Iraqi leadership to 'submit to the will of the people'.
Tehran has diverted its attention from calls on the multinational forces to
withdraw and allow countries of the regions to solve their own problems, to
increasingly identifying President Saddam as the root of these problems.
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's spiritual leader, has called Saddam an
incompetent ruler who brought ruin upon himself and his country through his
Kuwait adventure, while Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi, the head of the judiciary,
has said that Saddam must be tried as a war criminal.
The shift is a measure of the success of Mr Saddam Hussein's internal
security forces in crushing internal unrest, staged mostly by the
discontented Shia population in the south and the Sunni Kurds in the north.
Iran was careful not to appear too supportive of the Iraqi opposition
coalition - which includes the Shia groups - at the beginning of the
uprising, but has been sorely disappointed that the chance to remove Mr
Saddam is rapidly fading.
For its part, unnerved by the revolts and anxious to blame them on a foreign
enemy, Iraq has abandoned its own caution towards Iran, accusing it of
fomenting trouble in the south by sending in saboteurs across the border -
charges which Iran denies.
However, Iran's news agency has been giving extensive coverage to the
disturbances in Iraq, reporting successes which Baghdad claims are
exaggerated.
A new radio station, the Voice of the Islamic Republic in Iraq, began
broadcasting material hostile to President Saddam, from its base in Iran
less than four weeks ago. Tehran is also home to the main Shia opposition
group, the Supreme Council of the Islamic Republic in Iraq, headed by
Ayatollah Mohammad Baqr al-Hakim.
Both countries have accused the other of violating the 1988 ceasefire
agreement. In a move ominously reminiscent of the situation before Iraqi
troops invaded Iran in September 1980, Iraq sent a letter of protest to Mr
Javier Perez de Cuellar, the UN secretary general, on Sunday, listing
Iranian attacks on Iraqi positions on its side of the border.
Iran has also firmly ruled out a return of Iraqi aircraft which flew to Iran
during the height of US military operations. This week, Dr Ali Akbar
Velayati, Iran's foreign minister, denied that Iran was holding 148 aircraft
as Iraq maintained and said it only had 22 - a claim that has mystified
Western military analysts, who also support the higher figure.
Mr Hassan Ebrahim Habibi, the Iranian first vice-president, denied last
month that Iran was considering holding on to the aircraft as war
reparations. 'The damage inflicted on Iran during the eight-year war is so
huge that a few second-hand and wrecked planes cannot compensate even one
thousandth of it,' he said.
