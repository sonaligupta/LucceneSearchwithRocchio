FT  15 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Japan


There is more to the recent slide in Tokyo equities than meets the eye.
While the Nikkei 225 average has fallen by 11 per cent over the last month,
the more widely-based Topix index has fallen by only 6 per cent. Plans to do
away with the Nikkei partly explain this underperformance, since investors
have been selling small illiquid stocks unlikely to feature in the index
which will replace it. Since the Nikkei average is not weighted by market
capitalisation, such switching has acted as a heavy drag. Arbitrage traders
selling the Nikkei 225 futures contract and buying the Topix, the closest
proxy for the new weighted index, have added to the pressure.
The underlying slide in share prices is less easily evaluated. The flotation
last month of JR East, the railway company, drained liquidity from the
market and left a sour taste. The post-flotation premium of the share price
has been quickly eroded. The authorities also appear less keen than in the
past to provide a prop for a falling market by encouraging public sector
funds to buy equities.
Whether this reflects a new laisser-faire policy in government, or simply a
pragmatic response to the improved capital position of Japan's banks,
remains unclear. But retail investors are showing scant enthusiasm for the
stock market, unlike their counterparts in the US and UK. A poor interim
results season and continuing economic gloom provide little incentive.
