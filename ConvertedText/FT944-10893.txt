   ATHENS


Former Greek banking tycoon George Koskotas, central figure in a
multi-million dollar scandal which dragged down the country's Socialist
government in 1989, was sentenced yesterday to 25 years in prison for
embezzlement, Reuter reports from Athens. An Athens appeal court found him
guilty of embezzling millions from the Bank of Crete and forging bank
documents, court officials said. Seven other senior bank officials received
prison terms ranging from 10 to 16 years. A financial tycoon and press baron
during the 1981-1989 Socialist government, Mr Koskotas went on trial on
January 22, 1992, six days after a special court acquitted Prime Minister
Andreas Papandreou of all charges in the case. The 13 judge court, set up by
parliament in 1989, convicted two former ministers of involvement in the
scandal. More than Dollars 200m is missing from the bank which came under
state control in 1988.
