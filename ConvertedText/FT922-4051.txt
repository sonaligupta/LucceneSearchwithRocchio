FT  08 JUN 92 / UK Company News: GPA lifts offer to 85m shares


   By MAGGIE URRY


GPA, the world's largest lessor of modern commercial aircraft, has increased
the size of its global share offer from 80m to 85m shares. There has been no
change to the Dollars 10 to Dollars 12.50 (Pounds 5.45 to Pounds 6.80)
indicated range for the issue price. At the Dollars 12.50 price the offer
would raise over Dollars 1bn and value the group at Dollars 3.6bn.
The issue could be increased again by up to 12.75m shares under the
so-called 'green shoe' arrangements, should demand warrant it.
The group, based in the Irish Republic and headed by Mr Tony Ryan, is going
public through a four-part offer with tranches in the UK and Ireland, the
US, Japan and the rest of the world. The prospectus for the UK and Ireland
issue will be published today.
Advisers to the group said that responses to the international presentations
to potential investors had been sufficiently encouraging to increase the
size of the offer. There had also been a higher level of interest shown by
UK and Irish private investors than expected and as a result the prospectus
will be advertised in the press.
Of the extra 5m shares, 3.5m will be additional new shares, taking the
number the company is selling to 59.5m. If the price is set at the top of
the range GPA would receive Dollars 696m, net of expenses, from the sale.
Existing shareholders are selling 25.5m shares after the increase.
The proceeds will go towards financing aircraft purchases. GPA has
commitments to buy Dollars 11.9bn of aircraft by 2000, of which Dollars
7.1bn is due by the end of 1994. It has options to buy another Dollars 9.1bn
by 2000.
The group's banking covenants allow it a maximum debt to equity ratio of
5:1. The ratio is 3:1 before the offer. As well as committed loan
facilities, GPA sells aircraft to help finance purchases. In the last two
financial years these sales have raised Dollars 1.2bn a year.
GPA also taps the international bond markets for funds. It is finalising a
Dollars 522m deal securitising aircraft leases.
The offer period for the UK and Ireland part of the offer is being extended
by one day to June 16. Applicants in this offer can specify a maximum price
they are willing to pay or can agree to buy at whatever price is set. UK
applicants must apply for a minimum of 200 shares, costing at least Pounds
1,090 at the lowest price.
The price will be set on or about June 17, when the decision whether to
increase again will be taken. The price will be announced on June 18 at
12.30pm, with conditional dealings expected at 2.30pm.
That price will form the basis of public offers in the US and Japan and
private placements in continental Europe, Canada and elsewhere. These offers
will close on June 25.
