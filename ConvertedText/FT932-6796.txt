INDIA is sending a high-powered business delegation to the UK and France
next week to promote trade and investment.
The British visit follows other initiatives to stimulate bilateral business,
including a trip by Mr John Major, the prime minister, and leading
businessmen to India this year.
The Indian delegation will be led by Mr RP Goenka, head of one of India's
largest commercial groups and a former president of the Federation of Indian
Chambers of Commerce, organiser of the mission.
Britain was last year the fourth largest foreign investor in India, with
planned investments totalling Dollars 41m (Pounds 26.6m), up from Dollars
13m in 1991. France was the 15th largest overseas investor, with planned
investments in 1992 worth Dollars 10m.
India's software exports rose in the year to March by 37 per cent to Dollars
225m, according to figures this week from the National Association of
Software and Service Companies. The government has targeted software as a
key export industry. The UK-based Caparo Group's proposal to set up a
3m-tonne integrated steel plant in Orissa, east India, with the state
government as the partner has been cleared by the cabinet committee on
foreign investment and the Indian Foreign Investment Board, writes Kunal
Bose in Calcutta.
