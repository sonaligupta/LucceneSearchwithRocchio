FT  01 DEC 94 / International Company News: Computer groups establish
technical standards forum

Apple Computer, AT&T, IBM and Siemens yesterday announced plans to work
together to encourage the adoption of technical specifications that will
improve the compatibility of computer and telephone systems.
The companies said their goal was to identify, develop and promote open
technical specifications for data communications among a variety of devices
such as personal computers, personal digital assistants, telephones and
private branch exchanges.
'The revolution promised by the convergence of telecommunications and
computing will not reach its full potential unless our industries agree to
open, interoperable standards that make using a PDA, telephone and notebook
computer together as easy as turning on the different components of a stereo
system,' said Ms Ellen Hancock, senior vice-president of IBM.
The group initiative, called Versit, will become a forum for establishing
technical specifications, the companies said.
The group is 'small enough to get things done, but large and diverse enough
to make an impact,' said Ms Hancock.
Versit will work with other communication and computer companies, as well as
standards organisations. It is not clear, however, whether Versit will win
the support of other companies such as Intel and Microsoft that play a
central role in establishing de facto standards in the computer and data
communications industries.
Although presented as a neutral body that will further the objectives of the
computer and telephone industries, Versit will inevitably be controversial
because differing technical specifications are often competitive issues. It
is also uncertain whether Versit will be able to persuade other companies to
co-operate in widely licensing their technologies to create standard
specifications.
