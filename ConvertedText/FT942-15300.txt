FT  15 APR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool


Prices in Australia moved strongly ahead at the first sale to be held since
the Easter recess, at Sydney on April 12, but since then the market has been
steady and firm but not significantly dearer. The market indicator closed at
567 cents, 9 cents higher than at the closing sale before Easter. Prices
paid for other wool in New Zealand moved from firm to slightly dearer at
post-Easter sales, and South Africa this week was appreciably dearer in rand
terms, though a good deal less so if softness in the rand is taken into
account. Business in the wool-using industry is almost invariably said to be
quiet, with few new orders placed and considerable price resistance. Wool's
dearer trend this year is nevertheless not in doubt, even if progress is
slow
