FT  20 MAY 92 / Chevron finalises Kazakh oil exploration agreement


   By NEIL BUCKLEY


CHEVRON Corporation, the fourth largest US oil company, has finalised an oil
exploitation agreement with the former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan worth
Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 840m) over the next three years, writes Neil Buckley.
It is the largest venture agreed between a western oil company and a former
Soviet republic. Over the 40-year life of the project the deal could be
worth as much as Dollars 20bn.
Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev, Kazakh president, signed the deal with Mr Kenneth
Derr, Chevron chairman, in Washington this week, finalising details of a
protocol signed 10 days earlier. The speed with which the protocol was
finalised will be an encouraging sign for other companies involved in talks
with former Soviet states.
Chevron will acquire a 50 per cent interest in a joint venture to develop
the Tengiz and Korolev fields on the north-eastern Caspian Sea coast.
Work will begin in January next year on developing the two fields, whose
reserves are estimated at about 25bn barrels, of which between 6bn and 9bn
barrels may eventually be recoverable.
