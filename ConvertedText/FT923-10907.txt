FT  28 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Supplies held back

THE RUSSIAN government yesterday expressed concern about the low level of
grain deliveries to the state, saying that peasants had been holding back
supplies in the hope of an increase in the official procurement price.
Mr Alexander Kudelia, deputy head of the Russian Committee for Grain
Production, said that as of yesterday only about 1m tonnes had found their
way into government stores, compared with 9m tonnes at the same time last
year.
'The situation is serious but not catastrophic,' he told a news conference.
He said he believed that the peasants would stop hoarding their grain as a
result of an announcement by President Boris Yeltsin last week that the
procurement price would not be increased beyond the price obtained at
private commodity exchanges. The commodity exchange price currently stands
at Rbs10,000 a tonne for standard quality wheat.
A pick-up in procurement would in turn enable the government to meet its
target of purchasing 29m tonnes by November. Last year it scraped together
22m tonnes, with a poorer harvest than that expected this year.
Mr Kudelia said that he expected grain imports from other former Soviet
republics and the world at large to total between 16 and 19m tonnes, which
he described as an average level for previous years. This year's import
would included 3m tonnes already promised by Kazakhstan.
