FT  12 APR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Coffee at fresh peaks - Market
Report


   By REUTER


COFFEE futures surged in late trading yesterday as markets on both sides of
the Atlantic chased each other to fresh peaks.
At the London Commodity Exchange the July position closed at Dollars 1,468 a
tonne, up Dollars 31 on the day, after earlier dipping to Dollars 1,423.
'There's still no sign of the anticipated correction,' one trader said.
Another noted that the market was looking relatively comfortable at these
prices, reflecting tight robusta supplies.
London Metal Exchange COPPER and ALUMINIUM prices moved higher in tandem
towards the end of the after hours 'kerb' session, with the latter looking
set for further short-term gains, dealers said.
Aluminium recovered well from a midday slip below Dollars 1,330 a tonne, for
three months metal, and with buyers prepared to defend Dollars 1,320 prices
pushed up to Dollars 1,329, up Dollars 5 from Friday's kerb close.
The GOLD price slipped rapidly in the afternoon at the London Bullion Market
to fix at its lowest level since March 10, as dealers reacted to fresh
selling, mainly of silver, at the New York Commodity Exchange.
By the close it stood at Dollars 380.75 a troy ounce, down Dollars 5.45 on
the day. Silver was down 7 cents at Dollars 5.42 1/2 an ounce.
