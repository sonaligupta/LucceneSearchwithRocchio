KRUPP Stahl, the publicly- quoted steel subsidiary of Fried Krupp, will pay
a dividend this year for the first time since the start of the 1974 'steel
crisis'.
The dividend, expected to be DM5 a share, follows a return from ordinary
business of DM378m (Dollars 226m) in 1990 against DM563m in 1989.
Most will be used to build reserves, with DM70m going to repay part of the
government's restructuring loans made in the 1970s and 1980s. Post-tax
profit for Krupp Stahl AG was DM57m, slightly up. Shares are owned 70 per
cent by Fried Krupp , 25 per cent by the Iranian government, and there are
8,000 small shareholders.
