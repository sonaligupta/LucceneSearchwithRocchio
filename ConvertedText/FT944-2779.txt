FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: M&G rises 20% despite difficult markets


   By DAVID BLACKWELL


M&G Group, the independent unit trust company that stresses the importance
of high dividends, yesterday lifted its total pay-out for the year by 20 per
cent to 30p, matching the rise in earnings.
The board is recommending a final dividend of 17p (15p), to be paid from
earnings of 57.5p (47.8p) per share.
Pre-tax profits for the year ended September rose by 20 per cent from Pounds
50.9m to Pounds 61m. Funds under management grew by nearly 12 per cent to
Pounds 11.8bn (Pounds 10.6bn) - a record net inflow.
'We are extremely pleased with 20 per cent growth,' said Mr David Watson,
finance director, given that the markets had been difficult. The FT-SE-A
All-Share Index at the end of September was at an almost identical level to
the previous year.
Over five to 10 years 94 per cent of the group's unit trusts were in the
first and second quartile. 'We continue to offer above average investment
performance,' said Mr Watson. 'We treasure this highly.'
Unit trust sales more than doubled to Pounds 899m (Pounds 414m) and net of
redemptions jumped from Pounds 27m to Pounds 527m. The group's share of the
market for unit trust Pep sales grew from 9.1 per cent to 10.2 per cent,
helped by the removal of the initial charge on the Managed Income Fund Pep
in January.
Single premium life sales were 81 per cent higher at Pounds 237m (Pounds
131m). From January sellers of life insurance will have to disclose the cost
of management fees, and overall sales are expected to dip. But Mr Watson
said M&G was well placed to win extra business as it was among the lowest
charging companies.
Net asset value per share rose from 196.5p to 216.3p. The shares rose by 3p
yesterday, closing at 940p.
