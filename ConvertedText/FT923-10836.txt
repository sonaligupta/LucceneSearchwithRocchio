Apart from its frightful theme music, My Dead Dad (C4 at 8.00) is a rather
charming new comedy set in Glasgow - with comprehensible accents, for once,
and glimpses of super architecture.
It is not exactly side-splitting stuff to my ear, but nonetheless neatly
scripted and the revenant father and his would-be yuppy son are well played
by Roy Hanlon and Forbes Masson.
There are no laughs in Town Hall (BBC2, 9.45). The latest episode in this
impressive series about the London borough of Lewisham certainly brings home
the predicament facing local government in inner-city areas.
Carlo Levi's Christ Stopped at Eboli is a wonderful book and it made a not
half-bad film. But what of Levi's talents as a painter? Rear Window (C4 at
9.00) investigates Levi's art and in the process, contemplates yet again the
sorrows of the Italian south.
If you fancy the idea of crawling into bed in a state of deep gloom, then
the film to watch is The Fixer (C4 at 10.00), based on Bernard Malamud's
novel. The big plus, however, is fine performances by Alan Bates and Dirk
Bogarde.
