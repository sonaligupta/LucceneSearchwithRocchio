FT  23 JUL 93 / Observer: Cold snap


The wisdom of public servants' hallowed principle - 'give 'em an inch and
they'll take a mile' - is perhaps shown by the experience of the UK
Meteorological Office's inquiries service, opened in response to John
Major's Citizen's Charter.
From 400 calls in its first month, it's now up to 1,000-plus. Nor are all of
them easily answered, as witness the farmer's complaint about the office's
advance warnings of frosts weather-watchers can foresee. 'I can get most of
these from the evening TV forecasts,' he snapped. 'What I really want is a
warning of unexpected frosts.'
