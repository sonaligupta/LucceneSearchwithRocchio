Not all Brazilians are delighted with the triumphant return of the national
soccer team. Osiris Lopes, head of Brazil's Internal Revenue Service, says
he's resigning because the players and their hangers-on brought back an
Aladdin's cave of US consumer goods - and were not required to pay the
normal import taxes. Their booty - some 12 tons - includes freezers, video
recorders, gymnastic equipment, computers and a photocopier.
One of the main planks of the Brazilian government current economic reform
programme is a crackdown on tax-dodging. This latest event, says Lopes, is
'the last straw'.
