FT  16 DEC 94 / Peace seen to boost property market


   By SIMON LONDON


The Northern Ireland peace process has already brought heightened interest
in retail property in the province, with Belfast and the border towns
expected to gain most, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said
yesterday.
Research by the University of Ulster found property and construction
companies were also expecting housebuilding and sales to benefit. The peace
process was expected to bring greater mobility and more religious mixing in
private housing areas.
A rise in cross-border economic activity is also predicted, with the
Belfast-Dublin corridor likely to be the focus of development.
However, local companies anticipate intense competition as companies from
the rest of the UK move into the province.
Mr Denis Rooney, head of the institution working party, said: 'Our report
identifies tourism in particular as offering enormous potential for economic
growth provided the right infrastructure is developed. That means new hotels
and other facilities as well as communications services.'
