FT  10 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): New and old factories adopt similar
practices


   By CHRIS TIGHE


WORKING practices at established manufacturing plants in north-east England
tended to converge with those set up in the region by inward investors
during the 1980s, according to a report, Chris Tighe writes.
As inward investors adapted to local conditions and long-established
companies re-evaluated practices, there was a shift away from demarcation
and bonus systems, an increase in flexibility and innovation and a growth in
the importance of the supervisor.
But in research commissioned by the Department of Employment, Dr Ian Stone
and Dr Frank Peck of Newcastle Polytechnic also identified differences
between the attitudes of the two groups of employers over unionisation,
consultation and recruitment.
Long-established companies, they found, were more likely to work through
unions to achieve change, more likely to use informal methods of recruitment
and less likely to use formal attitude testing of applicants, and
'attitudinal development' in training.
Dr Stone and Dr Peck approached all 105 inward-investment manufacturing
plants with 20 or more employees which set up in north-east England in the
1980s. By August 1990 these plants had directly generated nearly 15,000 jobs
 -5 per cent of the region's manufacturing jobs.
A third of plants came from UK investors. Far East investors accounted for
19 per cent of plants but 40 per cent of jobs created.
The report found complaints from long-established companies about poaching
of skilled workers by newcomers.
