FT  07 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Clerical Medical bonuses trimmed


   By BETHAN HUTTON


Clerical Medical, the mutual insurance group, has cut its bonuses on
with-profits endowment policies, leading to lower pay-outs for both 10-year
and 25-year policies maturing this year.
The maturity value of a 10-year policy, taken out by a man aged 29 paying
Pounds 30 a month, is Pounds 6,537, down 6 per cent from last year, while a
25-year policy is worth Pounds 60,820, down 1 per cent. Bonus rates on
unitised with-profit policies and individual pension products have also been
cut.
Mr Paul Gregory, marketing manager of Clerical Medical's life business unit,
said the cuts were 'less acute than they might have been', and attributed
this to good investment returns at the end of 1993. However, he added:
'Bonus rates may be expected to continue to fall.'
AXA Equity & Law, which declares its bonuses in two stages, yesterday said
that reversionary bonuses (which are attached to a policy throughout its
life and cannot be revoked) on with-profit policies would be maintained,
while bonuses on unitised with-profit policies would be cut. The company is
due to announce terminal bonus rates - which determine final maturity values
 -for this year in February.
