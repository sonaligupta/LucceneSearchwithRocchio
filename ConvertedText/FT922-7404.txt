FT  19 MAY 92 / Letter: Employment training review must heed providers'
views


   From Mr IAN ROE


In its comprehensive review of employment training ('Employment training
faces review as criticism mounts', May 11), the Department of Employment
ought to consult and take on board the view of training providers.
In any event, it should: have the courage to stop using training schemes in
part to disguise the unemployment figures. The participants are unemployed
and they know it;
recognise that in employment training there have been real and substantial
cuts in funding, an unrealistic and penalising re-contracting process,
significant changes in paperwork administration and accountable bodies to
name but some. Providers have been asked, as always, to do more with less
and to deliver yesterday; release Training and Enterprise Councils from
their bureaucratic and financial straitjacket - and develop three- to
five-year flexible contracts so that the Tecs may do similarly with
providers;
admit that London Tecs are generally under-funded;
ensure that Tecs have, or have access to, the resources to provide quality
training and employment opportunities to those most disadvantaged in the
community. If not, then provide appropriate funding through other accessible
mechanisms.
The evidence that the 'disadvantaged' are, with the right resources,
achievers is overwhelming.
The Department of Employment should also:
recognise the role of the voluntary sector as provider of the above;
clarify, simplify and rationalise the benefit entitlement to all those who
are unemployed, on income support etc, irrespective of the training scheme
they join or its funding body.
remember it is easy to say that, in the final analysis, something has not
worked when its critics have been responsible for the progressive withdrawal
of its 'mother milk' before the availability of replacement solids. Ian Roe,
