FT  20 APR 91 / Poll go-ahead in Punjab and Assam


   By KK SHARMA


   NEW DELHI


INDIA'S caretaker government has decided to hold elections in the states of
Punjab and Assam despite violent insurgency there.
The Punjab decision has been taken in the teeth of opposition from most of
the main political parties. Two elections will be held simultaneously there
on May 20: for 13 parliamentary representatives, and for a new state
legislature. Elections in Assam are to be held three days later.
The only Indian state which will not be voting is Kashmir, which is also in
the grip of a violent insurgency by militants seeking secession from the
Indian union. Like Punjab and Assam, the state is ruled directly from New
Delhi.
Most political parties oppose elections in Punjab because they do not
believe fair and free voting is possible in the state.
