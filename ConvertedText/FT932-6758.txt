FT  27 MAY 93 / Investment decline likely in October, IFS warns


   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent


A FALL in business investment is likely later this year and this may hold up
any recovery, researchers from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, an
independent think tank, warned yesterday.
The researchers also said that changes to corporation tax between 1984 and
1986 produced a fiscal bias against investment equivalent to the effect of
interest rates being higher by up to 2 percentage points.
The reduction in capital spending from this October expected by Professor
Michael Devereux, Mr Kevin Denny and Mr Stephen Bond is linked to the ending
in that month of the Treasury's temporary increase in tax allowances for
investments.
This was introduced in the Autumn Statement last November in an effort to
boost company activity and stimulate an upturn.
But because of the characteristics of the UK tax system, the increase in
relief on plant and buildings from 25 per cent to 40 per cent will have
little overall impact, the researchers said.
They calculated that the move would have pushed up capital spending this
year by 6 per cent. But once the extra relief ends, investment in the three
years from 1994 will be about 0.5 per cent lower.
The changes to corporation tax in the mid 1980s went too far in scaling back
investment reliefs, the researchers said.
They believed the government should reform the system by giving businesses
tax relief on the cash they raised for investment through equity finance.
That might be introduced in this November's Budget, the first of a new
unified series of Budgets taking in spending as well as taxation.
