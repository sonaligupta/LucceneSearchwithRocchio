FT  21 DEC 92 / People: Wambold spearheads Lazard's international corporate
finance


Ali Wambold, a partner of New York's Lazard Freres & Co, has been given the
task of spearheading the international corporate finance business of its
London relation, Lazard Brothers & Co.
Wambold, 38, who is responsible for UK and European investment banking for
Lazard Freres, has been based in the London headquarters of Lazard Brothers
for several years, and will continue as chief executive of the New York
firm's London business.
However, his appointment as a managing director of Lazard Brothers, with
'particular responsibility to lead the firm's international corporate
finance business', is a further sign that the three Lazard banking houses -
in New York, London and Paris - are working increasingly closely together.
Although all three firms have been successful in their home markets, the
growing amount of international corporate finance work has resulted in a
need for better co-ordination.
David Verey, chairman of Lazard Brothers which is 50 per cent owned by the
Financial Times' parent Pearson, says that Wambold's job is new, but adds
that it was the 'message rather than the title' which was important. He said
that Wambold, who is descended from the old Persian royal family, had become
'very much part of the firm' and had 'great energy, guts and go'.
Wambold started his investment banking career on Wall Street, first with
Lehman Brothers and then Lazard Freres where he helped found Corporate
Partners, a Dollars 1.6bn investment partnership which takes friendly
long-term stakes in major companies. Included among his outside
directorships is a seat on the board of Albert Fisher.
Lazard Brothers has also announced the appointment of the following
executive directors: John Collins, Anthony Coveney, Federico de Giorgis,
Keith Jones and Nicholas Shott.
