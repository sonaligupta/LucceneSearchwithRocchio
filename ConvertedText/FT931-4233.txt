FT  11 MAR 93 / NKK's workforce to be reduced by 15%

NKK, the Japanese steel company, is to reduce its workforce by 15 per cent
over the next three years and slash capital spending by 40 per cent by 1995
NKK is the country's first steel company to announce a major restructuring
programme. Other groups in the industry, which face rising costs due to
heavy capital investments in the late 1980s, are expected to follow suit.
The company plans to cut staff by transferring workers to affiliates. While
most Japanese companies are reducing staff by targeting older workers, NKK
said its plan included younger staff members. It also said it would cut
divisions in new businesses other than steel which were unprofitable.
Japanese steel makers drafted restructurings in the mid-1980s, when demand
for steel plunged.  They abandoned them later in the decade in response to
the rapid growth in the economy. The low cost of capital further contributed
to heavy capital investments.
Despite the recent spate of shakeouts announced by large Japanese companies,
leading think tanks predict corporate Japan will face the first fourth
consecutive decline in pre-tax earnings in postwar history.
Nomura Research Institute, the research arm of Nomura Securities, said
yesterday corporate profits, excluding the financial sector, for the
business year ending March 1994 would fall 4.8 per cent.
Nomura said manufacturing industry will post a 5.6 per cent pre-tax profit
fall, but non-manufacturers will see a 2.6 per cent profit rise. Profits for
all industries for the first half to September are projected to fall 10.4
per cent, while effects of the government's increased public works spending
package are expected to start emerging during the second half, lifting
pre-tax profits by 9.2 per cent.
