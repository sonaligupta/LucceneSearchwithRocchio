FT  27 SEP 94 / Pounds 4bn cost of housing benefits attacked


   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent


The Pounds 4bn cost of housing benefit could be substantially reduced if the
government dropped a ban on leasing by local authorities, Labour claimed
yesterday.
Mr Jack Straw, Labour's housing spokesman, said that housing benefit - rent
subsidies paid to private landlords - had nearly quadrupled to Pounds 4.83bn
since the government deregulated private rents in 1989.
Deregulation was 'a harmful and monumentally expensive failure, whose costs
to the public purse are now approaching those of the poll tax,' he told a
local authority housing conference in Cardiff.
Mr Straw said the government had created a free for all for private
landlords. 'It is a rigged market . . . Private landlords can effectively
charge what they like, and many of them do,' he said.
Mr Straw said the average cost to the taxpayer of local authority housing
was Pounds 720 less per family than the cost of private rented housing.
He challenged Mr Jonathan Aitken, chief secretary to the Treasury, to cut
costs by allowing local authorities to lease homes from housing associations
for rental, rather than reducing the level of housing benefit.
