FT  05 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Inspec market float gives Pounds 100m
valuation


   By DAVID WIGHTON


Inspec Group, the speciality chemicals company which was a Pounds 40m
buy-out from British Petroleum 18 months ago, confirmed that it is coming to
the market via a placing and intermediaries offer valuing it at over Pounds
100m.
The flotation will raise just under Pounds 50m - the limit for an
intermediaries offer - of which about Pounds 37m will be new money. The
offer price will be announced on March 17.
The FT-SE 100 index has fallen almost 6 per cent since Inspec announced its
plan to go public a month ago, but Mr John Hollowood, chairman, said the
market weakness would have little impact on the flotation.
Inspec will use the proceeds to pay off expensive buy-out debt and Pounds
5.45m of deferred consideration to BP.
Following the flotation, there will be debt of some Pounds 7m and net assets
of Pounds 22m, to give gearing of about 32 per cent. Mr Hollowood said that
after-tax profits for 1993 would have been Pounds 7.5m on a pro-forma basis,
including a full year from recent US buy Allco and flotation proceeds.
Sir Charles Tidbury, former chairman of Whitbread, has joined the board as
non-executive deputy chairman and Mr Julian Sheffield, chairman of Portals,
is to be a non-executive director.
The flotation is being handled by Morgan Grenfell with Cazenove as brokers.
