FT  06 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Cowie accelerates to Pounds 15.5m


   By PAUL TAYLOR


T COWIE, the car leasing, motor trading, bus and tractor group, yesterday
reported a 28 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 12.1m
to Pounds 15.5m.
Turnover in the 6 months to June 30 rose to Pounds 393m (Pounds 323m),
including Pounds 44.6m attributable to the acquisition of the Keep Trust
motor group which was completed in May.
Earnings per share increased by 20 per cent to 8p (6.68p), based on a 33 per
cent tax charge, and the interim dividend is lifted to 2.35p (2p).
Sir Tom Cowie, who is retiring as chairman at the end of this year,
described the results as 'more than creditable.'
Mr Gordon Hodgson, chief executive, said they reflected 'continued organic
growth and cost-saving innovations in our contract hire operations, together
with our acquisition of the Keep Trust motor dealership and strong
performances from our bus and coach divisions.'
However, there was a decline in operating profits to Pounds 28.7m (Pounds
31.5m) partly reflecting the impact of falling interest rates on the core
finance division where interest income fell by Pounds 4m. Keep Trust's 18
franchised dealerships contributed Pounds 831,000 to operating profits in
the period.
Interest charges fell from Pounds 19.3m to Pounds 13.2m, mainly reflecting
falling interest rates. Borrowings totalled Pounds 290m or 230 per cent of
shareholders' funds at the half year, down from Pounds 309m at end-December.
The group gave a further divisional breakdown of its profits at the pre-tax
level.
The vehicle leasing business increased profits 31 per cent to Pounds 10.7m
(Pounds 8.16m) on turnover of Pounds 117.6m (Pounds 124.8m). Yesterday Cowie
Interleasing announced the acquisition of the corporate fleet management
operations of FMM Group, a subsidiary of Commercial Union.
The expanded motor division, which now comprises 42 dealerships, ranking
Cowie as the fourth largest motor retail group in the UK, lifted profits to
Pounds 3.66m (Pounds 3.48m) on increased sales of Pounds 249.4m (Pounds
174.8m).
COMMENT
Even though Cowie's results were broadly in line with expectations the
market reacted unenthusiastically yesterday pushing the shares down from
267p to 256p. Some investors may have been surprised by the conservative tax
charge - unlikely to be as high at year end - and may have been expecting a
bigger fall in interest costs. Nevertheless, the leased fleet should
continue to grow in the second half and new car sales in August look good
and margins should improve when manufacturers incentives resume. Excluding
the second half exceptional Pounds 4.6m profit on the sale of the group's
Henlys shares last month, full-year pre-tax profits should reach Pounds 33m,
producing earnings of about 17.6p and a prospective p/e of 14.5. The shares
still rate a buy.
