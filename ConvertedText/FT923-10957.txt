FT  28 JUL 92 / Observer: Godly Godley


Whatever may be thought of the old style Keynesianism of economist Wynne
Godley, he looks bound to leave a more lasting impression than most of his
kind.
In the 1950s his late father-in-law, the sculptor Sir Jacob Epstein, used
him as a model for a work for the then newly rebuilt Coventry Cathedral,
entitled 'St Michael triumphing over the Devil'. So which one of the two is
he?
'You'll be disappointed to hear it's not Old Nick,' chirps Cambridge's
professor of applied economics. 'I'm on the godly side as St Michael,
although only his face is mine. His body's an athlete who worked as a
quantity surveyor, whose own face was for some reason thought more fitting
for the devil.'
But Godley's features at least are cast in stone for all time?
'Well, bronze actually,' he says. 'But apart from that, I suppose so. Unless
the cathedral gets bombed again, at any rate.'
