FT  16 MAR 94 / Amendment to police bill agreed by Lords


   By IVOR OWEN


The House of Lords yesterday reluctantly approved complex provisions which
put into effect a government climbdown over the appointment of police
authorities, Ivor Owen writes.
They were described as an 'elaborate farce' by Lord Callaghan, former Labour
prime minister, who forecast they would be swept away when parliament next
dealt with legislation on the police.
Tory backbench peers, whose original condemnation of the powers sought by Mr
Michael Howard, home secretary, forced his retreat, criticised the
complexity of amendments.
Earl Ferrers, Home Office minister, said the 'complicated arrangement' to be
inserted into the police and magistrates' courts bill would ensure that
members of police authorities would be 'truly independent'.
