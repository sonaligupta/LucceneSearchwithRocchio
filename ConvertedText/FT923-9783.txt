FT  03 AUG 92 / Karabakh talks crisis averted


   By REUTER


   ROME


The collapse of international talks aimed at ending fighting in the disputed
Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh was averted last night when Azerbaijan
and Turkey decided to return to the negotiating table, Reuter reports from
Rome.
The two delegations stormed out of the 11-nation talks earlier in the day as
the representative of the disputed territory's Armenian leadership started
to address the meeting. They later agreed to shelve a dispute with the
meeting's Italian presidency which delegates said could have arisen from a
translation error.
