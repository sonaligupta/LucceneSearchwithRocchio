FT  20 MAY 92 / International Company News: La Caixa set to acquire Progreso

LA CAIXA, the Barcelona-based savings bank that ranks as Spain's biggest
financial institution, is seeking to add investment banking to its growing
business empire by means of the acquisition of Banco de Progreso.
The March family, one of the wealthiest in Spain, owns 65 per cent of
Progreso, a stake valued at about Dollars 116m at current stock market
prices. Spokesmen for the family and for La Caixa said that the negotiations
for Progreso's purchase were at an advanced stage.
The acquisition will gain La Caixa entry into the major corporate business
in Spain and through the company's London office.
La Caixa has customer deposits of some Pta47,000bn (Dollars 471.1m). It made
a net profit last year of Pta30.7bn.
La Caixa's decision about Progreso follows its acquisition of a 50-branch
strong banking network in France from Paribas, as well as purchases of an
asset management bank in Monaco and of a major stake in Credit Andorra. In
Spain, La Caixa paid Pta2.8bn earlier this month for the small private bank,
Isobank.
Strongly-entrenched in Catalonia, La Caixa is seen in Spain as a pioneer in
what is viewed as a steady encroachment by the big savings banks on what was
traditionally considered the preserve of the major domestic banks.
For the March family, the prospective disposal of Progreso represents a
further retreat from the financial sector.
Three months ago, Corporacion Alba, the stock market listed holding company
controlled by the family, realised Pta12bn with the sale of its 15.5 per
cent stake in the Signet Banking, its financial arm in the US.
