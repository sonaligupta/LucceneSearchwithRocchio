FT  05 AUG 93 / Jaguar US sales jump 30%


   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent


JAGUAR, the UK maker of luxury cars, increased its sales in the US, its most
important market, by 29.7 per cent in the first seven months of the year.
Sales in the US for the period rose to 6,828 from 5,266 in the same period
last year. July sales at 1,083 were more than double the 457 cars sold in
the same month last year, when demand was very depressed, the company said
yesterday.
Jaguar's improving fortunes in the US are the main factor behind its current
forecast that it will increase its sales worldwide for the whole of 1993 by
about 29 per cent to more than 29,000, compared with last year's 22,478.
In the first six months of this year sales worldwide rose by 8.8 per cent to
13,024 from 11,968 in the same period last year, but the company expects the
pace of recovery to accelerate in the second half of the year.
Sales are recovering from a low level following a steep decline in sales in
the previous four years from a peak of 49,494 in 1988.
Jaguar said yesterday that it had revised its US sales forecast upwards to
13,000 for 1993. Earlier it had forecast sales of 11,00 to 12,000. Sales
last year were 8,681, the lowest since 1981.
The improvement in the US is helping to compensate for falling sales in
continental Europe and Japan.
The recovery in its sales and output is allowing Jaguar, a subsidiary of
Ford of the US, to cut its losses, which were reduced to Dollars 115.1m in
the first half of the current year from Dollars 165.1m in the same period
last year.
The company said yesterday that under UK accounting rules it had a pre-tax
loss of Pounds 77.2m in the first half of the year, compared with a loss of
Pounds 88.3m in the corresponding period last year.
