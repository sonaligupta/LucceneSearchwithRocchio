FT  23 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Howard to meet police on Sheehy


MR MICHAEL HOWARD, the home secretary, is set to meet chief police officers
to discuss the radical proposals on pay and conditions in the Sheehy report.
The depth of anger among the country's 180,000 officers was clearly
demonstrated at Tuesday's rally at Wembley Arena denouncing the report.
Sheehy proposes fixed-term appointments, performance-related pay and changes
in pension rights, allowances and rank structure.
The three staff associations representing all ranks will hold meetings with
senior Home Office officials over the next three days to try to find common
ground.
It is likely Mr Howard will meet the senior officers on Tuesday.
