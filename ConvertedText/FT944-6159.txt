FT  30 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Severn Trent falls 26% after redundancy
costs


   By PEGGY HOLLINGER


Severn Trent yesterday announced plans to cut 750 central office jobs,
bringing the total number of redundancies announced in the water sector in
recent weeks to almost 3,000.
Severn Trent is taking an exceptional charge of Pounds 55m to pay for the
job cuts and other moves to reduce central support costs, such as investment
in systems and technology.
The news follows similar announcements from Yorkshire Water, Welsh Water and
South West Water in the first reporting season after the summer price
review.
The exceptional charge depressed Severn's pre-tax result for the six months
to September 30. On turnover 9 per cent higher at Pounds 533.6m (Pounds
489.8m) pre-tax profits fell by 26 per cent, from Pounds 146.9m to Pounds
108m.
Mr Roderick Paul, chief executive, refused to disclose the level of annual
cost savings Severn expects to achieve as a result of the rationalisation.
However, he said he expected 'quite a fast payback' on the Pounds 55m
charge.
The job cuts will occur in the 2,500-strong central office staff in the
utility division, over the next two years.
Severn Trent's profits were also helped by an Pounds 11.5m reduction in the
infrastructure renewals charge. This was offset, however, by the decision to
devote that benefit to mitigating the effects of higher drainage charges to
domestic customers next year. Severn expects to set aside Pounds 23.5m in
the full year for this purpose. As a result, said Mr Paul, domestic bills
were not expected to rise as sharply next year as would have previously been
the case.
Severn also announced plans to spend Pounds 24m on customer service
improvements, particularly in sewerage.
The regulated water business saw operating profits fall by 23 per cent to
Pounds 128.1m as a result of the exceptional charges, on sales 7 per cent
ahead to Pounds 421.9m.
Mr Paul said Biffa, the waste management company purchased for Pounds 216m
in 1991, had performed well. Operating profits were 15 per cent ahead to
Pounds 7.6m (Pounds 6.6m), on sales 25 per cent up at Pounds 74m (Pounds
59.1m). However, the division was still labouring under onerous financing
costs of about Pounds 24m a year.
The dividend is lifted to 8.23p (7.55p). Mr Paul said that, for the first
time, Severn would not be held to its traditional dividend policy of paying
one-third of the total at the interim stage and two-thirds at the final.
Earnings per share fell from 39.4p to 27.7p.
COMMENT
It is a pity that Severn has tarnished good underlying results with what
appears to be a determined effort to keep the market in the dark. The core
water business is going well, and the cost-cutting is welcome news. However,
the charge seems excessive compared with Severn's peers. Biffa, meanwhile,
is estimated not to have improved on the second half of last year -
disappointing in a business heavily exposed to economic recovery. Forecasts
are for annual profits of about Pounds 317m, before exceptionals, and a
dividend of 24.9p. This would leave Severn with a yield of 5.7 per cent,
slightly less than the sector average of 6. Severn's healthy dividend cover
of more than 3 times could open the way for better than average growth in
the longer term. Yet, so far, there is no clear indication that this
strength will be exploited in the near future.
