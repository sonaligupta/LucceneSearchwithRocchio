FT  21 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Canning disposes of polishing business


W Canning is selling the assets and goodwill of its polishing business to
the Fuchs group of Germany for Pounds 1.5m at completion. The consideration
represents an excess of Pounds 650,000 over net assets.
There will be additional payments for goodwill of up to Pounds 750,000 over
the following five years, depending on profitability.
Fuchs has effected the purchase through Canning Lippert, its newly-formed UK
subsidiary, which will combine the polishing side of W Canning Materials
with Fuchs' existing polishing business.
