FT  30 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Low bond yields keep declines
to minimum

Wall Street
ALTHOUGH the latest batch of bad economic news depressed US stocks
yesterday, low bond yields kept declines to a minimum, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 11.35at 3,518.85,
well above its lows thanks to a late burst of buying. The more broadly based
Standard&Poor's 500 ended 1.00 lower at 450.85, while the Amex composite
finished up 0.66 at 433.52, and the Nasdaq composite down 1.77 at 701.07.
Trading volume on the NYSE was 273m shares.
The economic news was bearish. May leading indicators registered a decline
of 0.3 per cent, May home sales plunged 21 per cent, and consumer
confidence, as measured by the Conference Board, fell for the sixth time in
the last seven months, from 61.9 per cent in May to 58.9 per cent in June.
The data suggested that the economy continues to struggle, and does not bode
well for the corporate earnings outlook. While all of this is bad news for
stocks, the sluggish economy has boosted bond prices, sending yields down to
record levels. The low yields have helped prop up equities, which otherwise
might have been in full retreat.
The bad economic news, however, hit cyclical stocks hard. Allied Signal fell
Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 67 5/8 , Caterpillar lost Dollars  3/4 at Dollars
74 1/2 , International Paper dropped Dollars 1 to Dollars 63 and Georgia
Pacific fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 57 1/2 . Aluminium Co of America
bucked the trend among cyclicals, rising Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 69 as
investors cheered the news that the company will cut its domestic primary
aluminium capacity by a quarter and lay off about 750 employees. The move is
an attempt to reduce the worldwide overcapacity in aluminium.
Technology stocks, which benefited from Monday's rally, gave back some of
their gains. Compaq, undermined by fears of a personal computer price war,
plunged Dollars 4 1/8 to Dollars 49 3/4 , Digital Equipment dropped Dollars
1 3/8 to Dollars 41 3/8 , IBM fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 49 3/8 , and
Hewlett-Packard gave up Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 82.

TORONTO prices closed little changed in moderate-to-heavy trading, as a
surge among gold stocks helped offset Northern Telecom's continued decline.
According to preliminary data, the TSE-300 composite index fell 2.22 points,
or 0.06 per cent, to close at 3,963.23.
Northern Telecom continued its sharp decline, after saying late last Friday
that it expects to report a second-quarter loss and that 1993 earnings would
fall well short of 1992 earnings. The company dropped CDollars 2 1/8 to
CDollars 35 on volume of almost 3m shares, after its CDollars 10 nosedive
yesterday. Its parent, BCE Inc., slipped CDollars 3/8 to CDollars 43 5/8.
