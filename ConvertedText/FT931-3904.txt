FT  13 MAR 93 / Fears grow as N Korea quits nuclear treaty

NORTH KOREA yesterday raised fears of an international confrontation over
its suspected nuclear weapons programme by declaring that it was withdrawing
from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.
The decision caused consternation among its Asian neighbours and in the
West. North Korea would be the first country to scrap membership of the
treaty, which seeks to limit the spread of nuclear technology.
Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, threatened North Korea
yesterday with possible international sanctions. Asked if the US would push
for United Nations sanctions against North Korea, he said: 'Certainly the
North Korean situation is a serious one today and if they continue on the
path that they are on I think that that will have to be considered.'
Japan, Germany and Britain also urged Pyongyang to reconsider the move,
which Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, described as 'really
dismaying'. Ms Madeleine Albright, US ambassador to the United Nations,
said: 'We call upon North Korea to withdraw its declaration immediately.'
The decision would halt inspections by the International Atomic Energy
Agency, which has carried out six inspections of North Korean facilities
since Pyongyang permitted them last year.
The Vienna-based body said it was a 'grave step' and began preparations for
an emergency board session next week to discuss a response.
The IAEA had given a deadline of March 25 for the government of Mr Kim
Il-sung, a communist dictator, to permit inspections of two storage
buildings at Yongbyon, North Korea's nuclear complex. It suspects the sites
are being used to store nuclear waste for re-processing of plutonium.
However, Pyongyang responded that this was not possible at present because
of the annual US/South Korean 'Team Spirit' military exercises, now under
way. This week it placed the country on a 'semi-war' footing in response to
the exercise, which was suspended last year in a goodwill gesture after the
two Koreas signed a non-nuclear pact.
North Korea insists that the two sites are non-nuclear military
installations of no concern to IAEA inspectors.
In Seoul, where the cabinet met in emergency session, the South Korean
foreign ministry said: 'The North's professed reasons for pulling out of the
treaty convince no one. This only heightens the suspicion that it is
developing nuclear arms.'
The move threatened to undo recent progress in developing inter-Korean
relations.
Expiry of the IAEA March 25 deadline could see the issue being transferred
to the UN Security Council, which could impose sanctions for non-compliance.
China, a permanent member of the Security Council and one of North Korea's
few remaining allies, issued a mild rebuke to North Korea. Behind its
careful diplomatic phrasing, Beijing has had increasingly strained relations
with Pyongyang and is likely to be exasperated by its behaviour.
