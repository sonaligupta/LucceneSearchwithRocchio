FT  03 SEP 93 / Property Market: A tough value judgment - The way UK
property valuations are calculated is a controversial subject, with critics
claiming that clients are being misled


   By VANESSA HOULDER


The subject of valuations still stirs up heated debate in the UK property
industry. Critics of current methods, including bankers, academics and
property companies, argue that the way chartered surveyors calculate and
present property valuations can mislead clients and contribute to the
volatility of the market.
These concerns have prompted the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors to
set up a working party on trends in client demand for commercial valuation
advice. The aim, according to Mr Clive Lewis, president of the RICS, is to
reassess what clients want from valuation advice and to clear 'our minds of
the preconceptions of the past'.
The group, headed by Mr Michael Mallinson, former property director of
Prudential Portfolio Managers, includes clients, valuers and an academic
researcher. It will canvass the views of property clients and professionals
before it reports in February.
The debate in the industry about property valuations is taking place on two
levels.
First, are valuers giving their clients enough information about the risk
factors associated with the valuation and the way it was arrived at? Are
valuations producing the figures clients understand and expect? Should
valuers express an opinion about the future trend in a property's value?
The difficulties with the current system are unlikely to be entirely the
fault of surveyors. Members of the Association of Property Bankers, which
was set up recently to discuss property issues, believe that
misunderstandings about the nature of a valuation are partly the fault of
the client. The association is now putting together a code of practice for
bankers on how to instruct valuers.
'If non-property people go to a valuer, they believe they are getting advice
when all they are getting is a valuation,' says Mr Richard Lovell, president
of the association.
He argues that banks need more than a valuation; they need 'a character
analysis' of the property, which could include questions of liquidity, its
sensitivity to fluc-tuations on the market, problems of lease structure and
allied risks.
Second, and more controversially, is the thinking behind a valuation
fundamentally flawed? Does the 'open market' method of valuation, which
relies on the prices fetched by comparable buildings, pay insufficient
regard to the intrinsic worth of a building in terms of the income it can
generate for its owner?
Capital & Counties, a property company which is one of the most vocal
critics of existing valuation principles, recently produced a discussion
paper on accounting treatment for investment properties. It concluded that
the current basis of valuation did not work well for certain types of
property - those that rarely came on to the market and for which there was
little comparable evidence of sales. Instead, the property's valuation
should reflect its 'value in use' to its owner.
CapCo also argued that, in difficult market conditions such as those of
recent years, a valuer might not be able to obtain accurate information
about transactions, because of confidentiality clauses and agreements that
are kept secret.
Another of CapCo's arguments in favour of changing valuation methods was the
fact that property investment decisions will increasingly be driven by
comparison with other, non-property forms of investment.
The company concluded that an approach was needed 'which is adaptable to
changing market conditions and to circumstances where there is a lack of
relevant comparable evidence and encourages valuers to value on an
investment basis as well as have regard to comparable evidence.
'A proper assessment of the value of fixed assets under such conditions
requires an analytical interpretation of future growth rates and interest
rates, of the changing nature of the market for all forms of investment and
of the inherent investment characteristics of the assets.'
The idea of including subjective issues, such as expectations of future
growth rates, or extrapolating past trends in a valuation is highly
controversial. One individual's opinion about future trends cannot be as
valuable as that of the market, which is the summation of many individual
viewpoints, say opponents. Moreover, if valuers had more discretion about
the assumptions underpinning the valuations, they might come under pressure
from a client wanting to massage the figures.
In the end, say the defenders of the existing system, the value of a
building is what somebody is willing to pay for it.
They also draw comfort from the apparent accuracy of valuations. A recently
published report by Drivers Jonas, chartered surveyors, and the Investment
Property Databank, a research group, which compared investment valuations
with actual prices paid, concluded: 'Valuation surveyors are still achieving
levels of accuracy as high as those produced in the much less volatile
market circumstances of the mid-1980s.'
The concern that the accuracy of valuations would deteriorate as the
investment market became less active and provided less evi-dence on which
valuers could base their judgments proved groundless.
However, some critics of current techniques think that this type of research
does not go to the heart of the problem. A report by the RICS about research
priorities, published earlier this year, said that the debate has centred on
the methods of examining the empirical data on valuations and sale prices,
not on the process by which sale prices are achieved and whether existing
valuations have any influence on the market price.
'The empirical work is therefore taking place in a vacuum,' it said. It
believed that the recessionary market of the early 1990s had exposed a basic
flaw in the philosophy of valuations. 'The fundamental problem is the
over-reliance on a methodology which is effectively one of simple comparison
and not an investment method from first principles.
'The last 30 years have seen the valuation profession become very insular in
outlook, such that the valuation of an investment property from first
principles appears to present the profession with a major problem.'
If the property market continues its recovery, the motivation for some of
the critics of valuation methods - who thought the value of their property
was unduly depressed - could disappear. Nonetheless, the intensity of the
debate suggests that the pressure on the surveying industry to re-examine
its valuation philosophy will remain.
