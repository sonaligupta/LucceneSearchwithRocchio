FT  25 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Colorgraphic falls Pounds 2.33m into the
red


Colorgraphic, the printing group specialising in advertising and direct mail
literature, was hard hit by the advertising recession with a fall from a
pre-tax profit of Pounds 2.01m to losses of Pounds 2.33m for the year to
December 31.
Although the cost savings made in 1991 limited losses at the operating level
to Pounds 147,000 (Pounds 2.92m profit), the pre-tax figure was hit by
higher interest charges of Pounds 1.07m and an exceptional Pounds 1.1m to
cover reorganisation costs and a bad debt in the US.
Further annual cost savings of about Pounds 1m have been identified for the
first half of 1992.
Turnover was down from Pounds 54.7m to Pounds 46.4m, with sales falling by
about 10 per cent after adjusting for disposals. This fall was compounded by
an average 3.5 per cent price reduction.
The group is proposing a nominal final dividend of 0.01p after passing its
interim for the first time. Last year there was a total of 6.86p.
Losses per share came out at 12.45p (9.09p earnings).
