FT  16 MAR 94 / International Company News: Life side behind Royale Belge
rise

   BRUSSELS


Royale Belge, Belgium's largest insurance group, yesterday said that an
expansion in its life insurance businesses had helped push profits up by 11
per cent last year.
Consolidated profits for 1993 were BFr4.9bn (Dollars 94m), up from BFr4.4bn
in the previous year. Turnover rose above BFr100bn for the first time, to
BFr104.4bn in 1993.
The board is proposing a dividend of BFr160 a share, up from BFr147 the
previous year. Mr Jean-Pierre Gerard, chief executive, said that the
improvement had been helped by the healthier financial climate and the
restructuring programme which the company has implemented in the past four
years.
This restructuring, which is expected to lead to a 20 per cent cut in the
workforce over eight years, has divided the group into two specific
operations, one of which deals with independent brokers, the other with
salaried agents.
