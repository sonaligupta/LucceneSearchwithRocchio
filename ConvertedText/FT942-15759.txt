FT  14 APR 94 / Economic Watch: Spanish unemployment declines


Spain's registered unemployed fell by nearly 15,000 to 2.76m or 17.92 per
cent of the workforce in March, the labour ministry said yesterday. This
fall compares with a rise of 57,725 in March 1993. 'This shows a change in
the employment trend, confirming increases in hiring and placements, higher
levels of occupation and a certain improvement in economic activity,' the
ministry said. The number of placements in March was up 26 per cent from
March 1993 at 489,130, which the ministry says is the highest monthly figure
registered since 1985. Apprenticeship and training contracts in the first
quarter of 1994 were up 114 per cent from a year earlier to 64,179.
German consumer prices rose 2 1/2 per cent on a seasonally-adjusted
year-on-year basis in the last three months stripping out a rise on oil
taxes from the start of this year, the Bundesbank reported yesterday.
The Netherlands' February year-on-year retail sales of non-food and durable
goods edged up by 0.2 per cent in real terms but were up 1.5 per cent in
nominal terms.
France's current account widened to show a seasonally adjusted surplus of
FFr16.08bn (Dollars 2.75bn) in January after a FFr15.68bn surplus in
December. Before seasonal adjustment, there was a FFr12.5bn surplus in
January and a FFr16.14bn surplus in December.
