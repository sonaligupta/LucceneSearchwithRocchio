FT  14 APR 94 / UK Company News: Secure expands banking side


   By ALISON SMITH


Secure Trust, the financial services group, is buying Aitken Hume Bank for
up to Pounds 10.5m, and partly financing the purchase with a placing of new
shares to raise Pounds 2.5m.
Secure will pay Pounds 3.2m at completion, and a further Pounds 1.3m within
the next year. The rest will be payable depending on the extent of recovery
of certain loans made by the bank.
AHB will be renamed Arbuthnot Latham and play a critical role in Secure's
plans to reorganise its UK banking operations.
The existing 30 staff in the sole office in London will be maintained.
It is intended the organisation will give Secure a focus for providing
banking services to professional employees and people who own and manage
small businesses.
Secure's existing banking business, the People's Bank, which is based in
Bradford and focuses more on skilled manual workers, was acquired last year
and as part of the reorganisation will become part of Secure Trust Bank.
Mr Henry Angest, Secure's chairman and chief executive, is looking to the
group's banking activities to provide much of its future growth.
Pre-tax profits increased by 4 per cent to Pounds 7.61m in 1993.
