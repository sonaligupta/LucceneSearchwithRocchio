FT  15 JUN 93 / Observer: Prize draw


Who's going to win the next Booker prize? No, not the literary prize for
fiction, but the number two slot at the Booker food giant when chief
executive Jonathan Taylor, 57, steps into the chairman's suite later this
week.
Presumably, Taylor is not going to upset the City by combining the role of
chairman and chief executive, especially given Booker's lacklustre
performance in recent years and Taylor's keenness to spend more time on good
works, such as raising money for Oxford's Bodleian Library.
Barry Skipper, chief executive of food distribution, and finance director
David Turner are the obvious internal candidates. But they have been around
for years and Booker could do with a bit of fresh blood at the top.
Let's hope that Taylor doesn't fluff his first big decision in the chair.
