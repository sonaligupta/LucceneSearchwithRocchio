FT  15 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Rise in duty no answer


   From Mr HUGH MORISON


Sir, Many commentators and City opinion-formers seem to have welcomed the
chancellor's decision to raise excise duties on spirits and other products,
on the grounds that this would close the gap left in his Budget by the vote
against raising VAT on fuel from 8 to 17.5 per cent.
The evidence of the past few years suggests, however, that Kenneth Clarke,
the chancellor, will fail in his objective; in the last year that followed
an increase in excise duty (1992-93) the chancellor's receipts from excise
duty on spirits fell by Pounds 80m. In the following year, after Mr Clarke
and his predecessor had frozen the rate of duty on spirits, Treasury
receipts actually grew by Pounds 46m.
This clear evidence of diminishing returns points to the likelihood that
last week's 4 per cent rise will once again lead to a drop in revenue
receipts.
Not only will the chancellor's action damage an important UK industry; not
only will it weaken the industry's attempts to overcome discriminatory tax
treatment in Europe and beyond; he has done all this in a desperate attempt
to raise revenue which will not materialise.
The chancellor will find that this particular crock of gold is at the end of
a very distant rainbow.
