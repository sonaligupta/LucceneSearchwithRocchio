FT  19 MAY 92 / International Company News: Sun Micro launches workstations


   By LOUISE KEHOE


SUN Microsystems aims to fend off mounting competition in the market for
computer workstations with a new range of products, to be introduced today.
The US computer company claims the new products will outperform all rivals.
Although Sun has maintained its lead in workstation sales, with over 25 per
cent of the Dollars 9bn world market, competitors including Hewlett-Packard
and International Business Machines have been gaining ground with
workstations that are significantly faster than Sun's products.
The new SparcStation 10 represents Sun's response to these higher
performance workstations. Two models, which Sun calls 'mid-range'
workstations, priced in the US at Dollars 18,500 to Dollars 25,000, will be
available in the third quarter of this year.
These will offer performance of 86m to 96m instructions a second and,
according to standard benchmarks, are comparable to similarly priced
workstations from H-P and IBM.
Later this year Sun will begin shipments of two high-end multiprocessor
models which outperform any workstations currently available, offering
processing speeds of 200m to over 400m instructions a second.
However, its competitors are not standing still, and Sun's claim that it can
offer 'the world's fastest desktop workstation' is expected to be
short-lived.
Competition among workstation manufacturers is intense. It is one of the few
segments of the computer market that has continued to grow strongly in spite
of economic recessions in leading markets.
The new Sun workstations will also provide users with a new way to merge
computer and telecommunications networks into a single system.
