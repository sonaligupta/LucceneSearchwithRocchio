FT  23 NOV 92 / Companies reveal wider-ranging data


   By ANDREW JACK


BRITISH COMPANIES are disclosing numerous non-financial indicators of their
performance, a study by Company Reporting, the Edinburgh-based annual report
monitoring service, has found.
Information - including production and sales volumes, market share, and
research and development data - is appearing in the reports of many
companies, the analysis of the FT-SE 100 top quoted companies found.
Little of the data is quantified or comprehensive, though, and most details
emphasise the companies' strengths and not their weaknesses.
The report suggests that the measures can be a valuable tool and are
sometimes more reliable than financial measures because they are not
affected by price changes or accounting policy choices.
The most widespread non-financial data cover the number of outlets, branches
and offices, shown by two fifths of companies.
Other commonly published indicators include market positioning, production
volume, sales volume, market share and number of customers.
Most data appear in the chairman's statement, operating review or directors'
report. The study says BAT, British Gas, Grand Metropolitan, Lonrho and
United biscuits are among the best at disclosing quantified measures.
The Accounting Standards Board's proposals on the operating and financial
review statement encourage the disclosure of non-financial information. The
study warns that core measures must be systematic and comparable over time
to be meaningful.
The board's decision to withdraw the requirement in the profit-and-loss
account notes to show revenue investment on items such as advertising means
that many such disclosures will be entirely voluntary.
The study shows that those disclosing revenue investment activities are very
few, with 22 per cent showing no such information and 48 per cent showing
only research and development expenditure, which they are obliged to
publish.
There was no apparent connection between the industry sector and the level
of type of disclosure.
