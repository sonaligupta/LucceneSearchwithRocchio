FT  24 OCT 92 / Briefcase, Q&A: Harmony in schedule E


MY WIFE is a self-employed part-time music teacher. She teaches 20 students
and earns about Pounds 11,000 a year. In January she will start working at a
private school, paid hourly at the same hourly rate, for an additional
Pounds 11,000 or so yearly. Does this single and relatively substantial
income source endanger her self-employed status for tax purposes?
Your wife's services at the school will (almost certainly on the bare facts)
fall within schedule E and the PAYE system, including class 1 NIC. That does
not affect her existing schedule D activities, nor her liability to class 2
and 4 NIC. There are limits to the overlap of NIC classes, so she should
consult the local DSS office if need be. She could ask her tax office for
the free pamphlet IR56 - Employed or self-employed?
No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the
answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as
soon as possible.
