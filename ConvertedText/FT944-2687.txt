FT  16 DEC 94 / Survey of World Commercial Vehicles (10): Good times roll on
and on - North America, heavy trucks / Laurie Morse looks at the road ahead


   By LAURIE MORSE


The North American heavy truck industry is enjoying the biggest boom in its
history, with 1994 production headed toward a record 205,000 units, and new
order backlogs so vast that the good times for truck assemblers should roll
straight into September 1995.
Experts say the industry is enjoying the peak of its cycle, with orders,
tempered by rising interest rates, expected to taper off about 10 per cent
next year, and another 15 to 20 per cent in 1996.
In the meantime, truck makers and their suppliers are struggling to meet
demand. This is the sixth consecutive quarter that North American class 8
truck producers, led by Freightliner and Navistar, have operated at or above
full capacity.
Although the cyclical recovery had been widely predicted, the extent of the
surge caught producers by surprise, resulting in some production bottlenecks
and a scramble by the leading truck makers to reposition production and
labour to make the best possible use of available resources. Navistar, for
example, added more than 600 workers this spring to meet demand, despite a
long-term campaign to trim labour costs.
Most factories are working round the clock, and companies that make a
variety of truck lines are retooling to place heavy truck manufacturing at
their highest-capacity plants. Still, component shortages continue to
restrain output, pushing production schedules to meet order backlogs,
currently above 100,000 units, deep into 1995.
The situation is the first test of the American industry since the rigorous
rationalisation in the mid-1980s. At that time, when demand was in a trough,
North American truck production consolidated, with subsequent capacity
reductions by truckmakers and their suppliers. Freightliner was purchased by
Daimler-Benz during that period, while Mack Trucks became a property of
Renault. International Harvester became Navistar, and sold off more than
half of its businesses.
Since truck makers are essentially 'screwdriver' companies that assemble
components made by outside suppliers, the fates and capacities of truck and
component manufacturers are closely linked. Some of the biggest winners in
the gold rush are engine makers such as Cummins and Caterpillar and other
leading truck compponent makers such as Rockwell and Eaton.
Ironically, even with the industry at an historic peak, investors are not
bidding up truck industry shares. 'Most of these companies are heavily
discounted because of their cyclical nature, whether they deserve it or
not,' one analyst said.
'Many companies, including Cummins Engine, have worked hard to balance their
businesses, with cyclical industries representing less than half of their
sales.'
Stark's Off-Highway Ledger, a Chicago-based newsletter that tracks the truck
industry, reports North American heavy-duty truck makers are operating at
109 per cent of available capacity in the fourth quarter, manufacturing an
average of 842 trucks a day. That compares with 743 trucks a day in the
fourth quarter last year.
Of that total, the newsletter says Freightliner is assembling 214 units a
day and operating at 129 per cent of capacity, and Navistar, under its
International brand, is making 170 trucks a day with capacity at a strained
148 per cent. Mack, the third-largest North American heavy truck maker is
assembling 118 trucks a day and is operating at 107 per cent of capacity.
Seattle-based Paccar, which owns Kenworth and Peterbuilt, is North America's
other big heavy truck producer. Combined, Paccar's companies are assembling
an average of 157 heavy-duty trucks a day this quarter.
Industry leader Freightliner's sales are projected to be up 28 per cent this
year at Dollars 3.9bn.
Navistar's sales are also surging, at Dollars 5.3bn, but high operating
costs limited 1994 net income to just Dollars 82m.
David Healy, an auto and autoparts analyst with SG Warburg in New York, says
the heavy truck boom has hit with such gusto for more reasons than a
prolonged period of low interest rates and pent-up demand. 'Truck traffic is
very strong, and fleets of existing trucks are ageing,' he says, 'but even
newer trucks are being replaced. There has been such engine innovation
recently, in terms of environmental considerations and from the standpoint
of fuel use, that it makes it smart to replace to get lower operating
costs.'
He says that just-in-time inventory procedures adopted by a vast number of
US companies over the past decade have also boosted truck traffic. 'It seems
that what used to be kept in the warehouse is now kept rolling on trucks,'
he says.
In fact, the volume of heavy truck orders serves as a leading economic
indicator for some analysts. 'Truck volumes precede the economy by three to
six months,' says John Stark, editor of the Off-highway Ledger. 'Since heavy
trucks carry volumes of goods from one part of the country to another, they
reflect early changes in the economy.'
Truck company executives fear that if the US tightens interest rates any
further, it will lead to a flood of order cancellations late this year.
However, to date there has been little sign of order slowdowns.
