FT  04 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: Sao Paulo recovers as tax
worries recede


   By PATRICK MCCURRY


   SAO PAULO


The Sao Paulo stock market staged a partial recovery early yesterday after
falling 6.4 per cent on Wednesday over fears that foreign investors will
have to pay a financial operations tax of up to 25 per cent on new money
entering the country.
The fears followed passage of a measure which gives the government the
option of introducing the tax if necessary to stem a rush of foreign capital
into the country which could jeopardise the government's current
anti-inflation plan.
The central bank also introduced stricter rules for Brazilian companies
wanting to issue Eurobonds and other fixed income securities. The bank
decreed that the financial operations tax (IOF) could in future be levied on
all exchange operations, including equities investment.
Stock brokers believe that no restrictions on equity investment are
imminent. If the government decides to take further action it will first
target Eurobonds and other debt instruments by increasing their IOF tax
rate, they said.
