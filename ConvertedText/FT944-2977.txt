FT  15 DEC 94 / Observer: Bottoms up


Long live the beerage. Sir Paul Nicholson, the deer-stalking chairman of
Vaux, the Sunderland brewer and hotelier, has just become the third
generation of his family to chair the Brewers and Licensed Retailers
Association.
Grandfather was chairman of the association for six years in the 1920s and
1930s, and father for a year in the 1960s.
But despite his pedigree - Harrow, Cambridge and the Coldstream Guards  -
Sir Paul likes to give the impression that his family are strictly
tradespeople and not hereditary owners of what he likes to refer to as his
'booze and snooze business'. Bit hard to believe - given that he got the
chairman's job at 38 and has been doing it for nearly 20 years.
True, Sir Paul's grandfather started at Vaux as a humble accountant in 1896,
and the family now owns less than 1 per cent of the company. Then again when
grandad wanted to catch the night sleeper to London he could get it to halt
at the bottom of his drive.
Not even Sir Paul, the new president of the Northeast Chamber of Commerce,
can command that sort of service these days.
