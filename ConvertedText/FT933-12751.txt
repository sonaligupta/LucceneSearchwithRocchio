FT  22 JUL 93 / International Company News: Mitel benefits from growth in US
and Asia


   By ROBERT GIBBENS


   MONTREAL


RISING sales in the US and Asia helped Mitel, the Canadian telephone
equipment maker, to record a profit of CDollars 3m (USDollars 2.4m), or 2
cents a share, for the quarter ended June 25, writes Robert Gibbens in
Montreal. This compares with a loss of CDollars 7m, or 10 cents, a year
earlier, on revenues of CDollars 107m, up 13 per cent.
Mitel, which makes telecom switches, semiconductors and computer systems,
said productivity gains also helped.
Mr Anthony Griffiths has stepped down as chairman.
