from sale of holdings

Outokumpu, the Finnish mining and metals group, has raised ADollars 22m
(USDollars 16m) from the sale of minority stakes in three Australian base
metal ventures to Pancontinental Mining.
The disposals are in line with the group's strategy of rationalising its
minority interests. Proceeds will be used to develop its other Australian
activities, including the Forrestania and Honeymoon Well nickel projects in
western Australian and the Panorama zinc project in the Pilbara region of
western Australia.
The main transaction involves the sale of Outokumpu's 25 per cent stake in
the Thalanga zinc, lead and copper mine in Queensland. The Finnish group is
also selling a 25 per cent stake in Mt Windsor, an exploration project, and
a 24 per cent stake in Lady Loretta, an undeveloped zinc resource.
Pancontinental aims to end up with 100 per cent control of all three
projects, after separately buying out another joint venture partner. The
Australian group says the total cost of the moves will be ADollars 42m.
