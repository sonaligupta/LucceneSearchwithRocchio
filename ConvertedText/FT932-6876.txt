FT  26 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Chemicals sector pressures


   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON and PETER JOHN


RUMOURS that Courtaulds, the chemicals group, was poised to announce a
rights issue with its results today depressed the share price in early
dealings, but were finding little credence by the close of trading.
One analyst had warned earlier this week that a bear raid on Courtaulds 'was
not impossible' given the company's net debt of as much as Pounds 400m and
impending demands on shareholders from Zeneca and BT.
Moreover, the specific nature of yesterday's rights rumours - that
Courtaulds would announce a one-for-four cash call to raise Pounds 450m  -
pointed to a bear raid and the shares, down 9 at one stage, turned the
corner in the afternoon to end 9 ahead at 522p. Courtaulds is expected to
announce full year profits of around Pounds 190m today.
