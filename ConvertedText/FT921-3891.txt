FT  12 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Cost reductions and staff cuts offset lower
profitability at BTR


   By ANDREW BOLGER


BTR, the industrial conglom-erate, said the protracted recession in the UK's
construction and allied sectors had led last year to a loss of
profitability. However, the downturn had been mitigated by cost reductions.
BTR reduced its worldwide workforce of more than 100,000 by 10,700 during
1991.
In other sectors of the UK, despite intense pressure, cost savings had
ensured a performance close to or in some cases above that of 1990.
On mainland Europe, profitability was ahead, with a strong performance in
the industrial and transportation sectors offsetting weakness in consumer
markets.
The Americas had experienced difficult trading conditions and there had been
weakness in many of the group's markets. However, the businesses in sealing,
valves and baggage handling had all produced excellent results.
Results from Africa were affected by a poorer tyre market in South Africa
and generally by the weakness of local exchange rates when converted to
sterling.
BTR said: 'Overall we believe that our world spread will gain us the
benefits of any economic improvement wherever it occurs. A more general
recovery, however modest, will yield immediate and substantial gains.'
As announced at the interim stage, BTR's results now include a corporate
activities business segment, which includes profits from disposals. Last
year's gain of Pounds 103m (Pounds 29m) came mainly from the disposal of its
Pretty Polly hosiery business.
BTR said it made important acquisitions in its global packaging business
during 1991. Its purchase of the US-based Continental PET in January, with
its advanced plastic packaging technology, had opened this process for
worldwide development within the group's packaging business.
The acquisition of Smorgon glass in July had reinforced the group's position
in Australasia.
It said the purchase of Rockware, Britain's biggest manufacturer of glass
containers, for Pounds 197.2m in September had gained the group a
considerable presence in European glass packaging and would significantly
enhance the global transfer of technology in this sector.
