FT  16 JUN 93 / Collor interrogated by Supreme Court


Brazil's disgraced former President Fernando Collor was interrogated by the
Supreme Court yesterday in the first stage of his trial on corruption
charges. He was impeached last December over alleged involvement in a
kickback scheme said to have made him Dollars 51m (Pounds 33.1m). He denied
any wrongdoing and claimed the money was the remains of his campaign chest
for the 1989 elections, along with a Dollars 5m loan of gold from Uruguay.
He said he knew nothing about 'phantom' bank accounts through which alleged
bribes were supposedly paid.
