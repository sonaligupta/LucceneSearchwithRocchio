FT  23 OCT 92 / US banks challenged on Brazil tax claims


   By GEORGE GRAHAM


   WASHINGTON


THE US Internal Revenue Service is challenging several hundred million
dollars of tax credits claimed by US banks on loans to Brazil.
In a test case brought to the US Tax Court by Riggs National Bank, a small
Washington DC bank, the IRS says US banks claimed 'phantom' credits for
withholding taxes paid in Brazil in the mid-1980s.
Although the Riggs case involves relatively small sums, the IRS said in
court filings that Citibank, the big New York-based banking group,
'presumably has the largest stake in the outcome'.
Citibank officials declined to comment on the case, but the bank is involved
in a suit with the IRS on the same subject.
The IRS says Riggs produced receipts for taxes paid on loans it made to the
Brazilian central bank, but contends that the central bank in fact never
paid any such tax to the Brazilian treasury.
'The fundamental purpose of the foreign tax credit is to avoid double
taxation, and there simply was not taxation in Brazil,' the IRS said in
documents filed with the tax court.
The IRS has been broadly successful in similar cases it brought earlier
against banks involved in lending to other Latin American countries such as
Mexico, but some of the legal issues remain in dispute.
