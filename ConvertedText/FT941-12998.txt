FT  27 JAN 94 / International Company News: BCI improves 1.8% to L268bn

   ROME


Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI), the commercial bank controlled by IRI, the
Italian state holding company, has announced parent company net profits up
1.8 per cent to L268bn (Dollars 163m) in 1993.
The results, coming shortly before the bank is privatised, reflected a heavy
increase in tax provisions, to L713bn, up from L290bn, and a large increase
in sums set aside for possible loan losses.
The loans provision has been increased to L554bn from L373bn reflecting the
effect of recession in the domestic market.
The proportion of doubtful loans in BCI's portfolio rose to 3.3 per cent
from 2.9 per cent - but this was almost the average percentage for the
Italian banking system.
Net interest income for the year remained stable, marginally increasing to
L2,822bn from L2,816bn. Total assets amounted to L115,813bn at year end,
against L111,577bn. Non-interest income rose 78 per cent to L1,738bn,
benefiting from favourable market conditions.
The directors are proposing unchanged dividends of L200 per ordinary share
and L230 for savings shares still outstanding after the conclusion on
February 11 of the offer to convert savings into ordinary shares paying L250
to BCI.
Net profit for the group, to be announced in February, is expected to
reflect an improved performance by BCI subsidiaries and allowing a better
overall result than 1992.
