FT  01 JUL 92 / Australia unveils savings


   By REUTER


   CANBERRA


Australia's Labor government yesterday unveiled a compulsory national
savings scheme to inject billions of dollars into pensions to cope with an
ageing population, check foreign debt and boost investment in industry,
Reuter reports from Canberra.
'There is scarcely one economic indicator that will not be enhanced as a
result of increasing our domestic savings,' said Mr John Dawkins, federal
treasurer. Employers will have to pay 9 per cent of their payroll into a
pension fund for employees by 2002. Employees will also have to pay 3 per
cent of salary to the fund by the year 2000. At present, private sector
employers pay only 3 per cent of salary into a pension fund, with added but
voluntary employee contributions.
