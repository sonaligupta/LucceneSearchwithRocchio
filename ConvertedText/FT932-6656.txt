FT  27 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: UK gilts


It almost seems as though there is nothing to fear from the government's
gilt-edged auctions any more. Yesterday's sale had a lower cover ratio than
the previous two. But at nearly 1.6 times, cover was well up on the January
and February sales. Equally encouraging was the lack of tail - or difference
between the average and lowest accepted price. The danger is that, as the
auctions become routine, the markets will automatically expect them to
proceed smoothly.
The immediate reaction to an auction result is often more an indication of
how well market-makers positioned themselves than of overall demand. But
other factors may have influenced the positive response to yesterday's
auction. The issue involved was deliverable into the futures contract which
effectively permits institutional investors, not just market-makers, to go
short beforehand. There may thus have been some additional short-covering
after the auction.
There is also some overseas interest. Investors are disillusioned with the
D-Mark after the Danish vote in favour of Maastricht, and with the dollar as
worries mount about both the US recovery and inflation. At some 130 basis
points over those on German paper, sterling yields look attractive. The
trouble is that investors who buy on the basis of such differentials can
quickly turn sellers. A better measure of how the funding programme is going
is perhaps the 50 basis point rise in 10-year yields since March. There is
probably room for more as the weight of supply increases.
