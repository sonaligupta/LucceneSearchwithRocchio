FT  08 NOV 94 / International Company News: Mexican group to buy Upjohn's
seeds unit

   MEXICO CITY


Empresas La Moderna (ELM), a Mexican tobacco and agriculture business, has
agreed to buy the Asgrow Seed Company, a subsidiary of Upjohn, the US
healthcare and chemicals business, for Dollars 300m.
The deal is expected to be concluded at end-December, subject to regulatory
approval.
Asgrow is one of the world's five leading agricultural seed companies, with
revenues last year of about Dollars 300m, of which about half came from the
US and the remainder from Europe, Asia and Latin America. It researches,
develops and markets 1,000 varieties and 31 species of seeds for the
processor and fresh market produce business.
ELM's acquisition is part of a strategy to diversify from its core tobacco
business into agriculture. Last year it took 51 per cent of Agricola Batiz,
an exporter of fruits and vegetables to the US.
Mr Alfonso Romo, chairman of ELM, said that the transaction 'fits perfectly
with our vision to establish a strong agriculture and biotechnology
business'.
He said the combination of ELM's marketing skills and Asgrow's research and
development abilities would give ELM a unique position in a market in which
Asian and Latin American countries would become increasingly important.
Mr Ley Smith, chief executive of Upjohn, said 'because of changes in our
industry, Upjohn needs to focus on its core pharmaceutical business'.
Asgrow's purchase price represents about 10 per cent of ELM's stock market
capitalisation, and its annual sales about 20 per cent of ELM's total. ELM
is an affiliate of Grupo Pulsar, a conglomerate controlled by Mr Romo.
