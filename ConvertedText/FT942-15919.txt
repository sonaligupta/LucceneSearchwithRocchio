FT  13 APR 94 / MP dies in motorway crash


   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent


Mr Bob Cryer, the 59-year-old Labour MP for Bradford South, was killed in a
car crash on the M1 yesterday on his way to London for the opening day of
the summer session of parliament.
Police said Mr Cryer's Rover overturned on the southbound carriageway near
the exit for Watford, Hertfordshire. No other vehicles were involved. Mr
Cryer's wife Ann, who was in the car, was slightly hurt.
A by-election is likely to be held in the early summer. It brings the number
of pending by-elections to six, five of which are in Labour-held seats.
Mr Cryer had a majority of 4,902 over the Conservatives at the 1992 general
election, with the Liberal Democrats a poor third. The seat would normally
be regarded as marginal, but the government's unpopularity makes a
Conservative by-election victory unlikely.
The accident robs the Commons of a fiery and assiduous leftwinger who was an
expert on procedure and the scrutiny of secondary legislation such as
parliamentary orders.
He was a leading member of the Campaign group of hard-left Labour MPs, a
committed supporter of nationalisation and socialist economic policy, and an
implacable opponent of Labour's modernisers.
Mr Cryer entered parliament in 1974 as MP for Keighley, but was defeated in
the Conservative election victory in 1983. He served for two years as a
junior industry minister under Mr Eric (now Lord) Varley, but resigned in
1978.
He sat as Labour member of the European parliament for Sheffield for five
years from 1984.
Mr Cryer also leaves a son and a daughter.
