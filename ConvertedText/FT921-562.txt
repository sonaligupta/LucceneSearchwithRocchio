FT  28 MAR 92 / Money Markets: Longer rates firm


LONGER RATES firmed yesterday as the market digested the latest opinion poll
in the morning suggesting a strong swing to Labour in London's marginal
seats, writes Andrew Jack.
Early activity in most dates from one month to one year trickled away in
morning trading, while the Bank of England kept rates on shorter money down,
calming the volatility generated by continuing political uncertainty.
Overnight rates fell below 10 per cent during the day before settling back
to close at 10 1/4 -10 1/8 per cent.
Three month money eased on the opinion polls, closing at 10 13/16 -10 25/32
per cent down  1/8 per cent on the previous day.
One year money rose to 11 1/16 -10 15/16 per cent by the end of trading,
compared with 11-10 7/8 per cent on Thursday.
The June sterling contract continued its fall, closing at 88.98 against
Thursday's close of 89.08. It opened up at 89.11, and rose as high as 89.11.
At one point it dropped to 88.96, which dealers said was partly explained by
the opinion poll released during the day. The volume was the highest for
several days at 29,833.
The Bank of England forecast a shortage of around Pounds 850m in the
morning, driven by Pounds 600m from a rise in note circulation, Pounds 573m
in treasury bills and maturing assistance, Pounds 205m in bankers balances
below target and Pounds 180m in bills for repurchase by the market, offset
by Pounds 685m of exchequer transactions.
The Bank of England purchased bills totalling Pounds 745m in early
operations, including Pounds 395m outright. It bought Pounds 15m in band-1
treasury bills at 10 3/8 per cent, and Pounds 267m bills in band-2 at Pounds
113m at 10 3/8 per cent as well as Pounds 350m for re-sale to the market on
April 7 at 10 7/16 per cent.
At midday it revised its forecast to a shortage of around Pounds 1bn before
taking account of early operations. It purchased a further Pounds 248m in
the market. These comprised Pounds 98m band-1 treasury bills at 10 3/8 per
cent and Pounds 150m bills at 10 3/8 per cent.
In the afternoon, the Bank of England revised its forecast up further to
Pounds 1.1bn. It bought Pounds 126m band-1 bills at 10 3/8 per cent. There
was no late assistance.
'The Bank of England has been providing assistance and will continue to do
so all the way to the election,' said Mr David Cocker of Chemical Bank.
