FT  11 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Chancellor joins effort to prepare
Tory MPs for public spending announcement


MR Norman Lamont, the chancellor, yesterday joined the concerted effort by
the Treasury to prepare opinion among Tory MPs for a tough public spending
announcement tomorrow.
The campaign, involving all Treasury ministers in an intensive series of
meetings with every Tory MP, signals the government's nervousness both about
the severity and potential unpopularity of the planned expenditure
programme.
At a meeting with Tory members of the cross-party Treasury committee of MPs
and with officers of the Conservative backbench finance committee, Mr Lamont
warned that the economic achievements of the Tory administrations since 1979
would be at risk unless the government held firm on public spending.
In particular, the chancellor highlighted the rise in government spending as
a proportion of national income, after earlier success in cutting it back.
