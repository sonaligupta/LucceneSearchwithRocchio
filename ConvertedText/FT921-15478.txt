FT  10 JAN 92 / Sweden to reform foreign aid terms


   By ROBERT TAYLOR


   STOCKHOLM


SWEDEN is about to reform its aid programme to the developing world by
insisting recipient countries prove their commitment to democracy, the
defence of human rights and the creation of free market economies before
they receive bilateral financial assistance.
Action will also be required by the recipients to stamp out corruption and
to make sure aid reaches those who need it.
The shift in Swedish foreign aid policy will be announced today when the new
non-Socialist government presents its first budget. However, Sweden will
retain its commitment to provide the high level of 1.0 per cent of its gross
domestic product to development assistance.
It remains only one of four countries in the world that has met the United
Nations target of 0.7 per cent of GDP. The others are Holland, Denmark and
Norway.
In the last financial year the Swedish government allocated just under
SKr13bn (Pounds 1.24bn) for aid.
The present government's aid programme planned for the newly independent
Baltic states will be funded separately.
Traditionally, Swedish aid was focused on a number of countries such as
Tanzania, Mozambique, Vietnam, Cuba and Angola, who were viewed
sympathetically by the ruling Social Democrats for ideological reasons.
However, the non-Socialist government has less political sympathy with many
regimes once favoured by Sweden.
