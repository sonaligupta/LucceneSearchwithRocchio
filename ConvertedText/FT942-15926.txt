FT  13 APR 94 / Trade group for motorsport formed


   By KEVIN DONE


Leading players in UK motorsport are forming a trade association to promote
the sector, which has established an important role in the world motor
racing industry, Kevin Done writes.
The British motorsport industry has an annual turnover of more than Pounds
1bn, of which exports account for more than 40 per cent, and provides about
50,000 jobs.
Many of the leading Formula One teams are based in the UK. Britain is an
important source of engines and cars for the IndyCar series in the US.
Founder members of the Motorsport Industry Association include Cosworth
Engineering, Dunlop Motorsport, Race Car Engineering, the Jim Russell Racing
Drivers School, Premier Fuel Systems and Andersen Consulting, a sponsor of
Nigel Mansell's Newman Haas team in the IndyCar series.
The association said its main objectives included promotion of export
opportunities in conjunction with the Department of Trade and Industry, and
promotion of motorsport in marketing by British and European industry.
It also intends to introduce an industry code of practice to encourage a
'more responsible approach to business activity'.
