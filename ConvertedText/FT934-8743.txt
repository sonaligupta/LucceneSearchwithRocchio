FT  13 NOV 93 / Markets: Lloyds changes overdraft charges - At a glance


LLOYDS BANK has changed the charging structure for customers who become
overdrawn. Those who go into unauthorised overdraft, or exceed their
overdraft limit, by more than Pounds 10 on any one day will be charged
Pounds 7. If the unauthorised overdraft increases by more then Pounds 10 the
next day, there will be another Pounds 7 charge. The bank is abolishing
existing charges of Pounds 10 for informing customers of their overdraft by
phone or letter or Pounds 3 for advising them by statement. The Pounds 4
charge for a cheque paid into an account and then returned is also being
dropped, as is the existing Pounds 5 fee for going into an unauthorised or
increased overdraft.
The penalty free overdraft of Pounds 100 on Classic and Current accounts
will be reduced to Pounds 50 from January.
