FT  23 NOV 92 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Focus on Germany


   By JAMES BLITZ


IN THE WAKE of last week's turmoil in the European exchange rate mechanism,
dealers will pay even more attention to the prospects for a reduction in
official German interest rates this week, writes James Blitz.
The markets have recently tempered their optimism about an easing in German
monetary policy, and money markets continue to doubt whether there will be
another cut in the discount rate this year.
However, the after-effects of Sweden's float of the krona pushed weaker ERM
currencies nearer their floors last week, and the earlier optimism about a
rate cut is again taking hold.
An important indication of whether the Bundesbank can afford to ease policy
will come in the M3 money supply figures for October due out this week. Mr
Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, believes the figure
will rise to 9.5 per cent from a previous 9.3 per cent. This falls well
outside the current annual target range of 3.5-5.5 per cent.
Mr Mackinnon points out that the Bundesbank is due to revise its target for
M3 growth next month. The 5 independent economic advisers to the German
government - the 'five wise men' - said last week that the M3 target should
be revised up from 6 per cent to 8 per cent.
In the US, the main focus will be on this week's preliminary figure for 3rd
Quarter GDP, due on Wednesday, and the figures for Durable Goods orders and
Consumer confidence in September and October due out tomorrow. Both will
give further indications of the strength of the upturn in the US economy.
However, analysts believe that the economic appointments of Mr Bill
Clinton's new administration are certain to have a more immediate impact on
dollar/D-Mark trading.
