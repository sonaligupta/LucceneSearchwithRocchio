FT  11 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: New Italian tax regime for
international investors


   By RICHARD WATERS


INTERNATIONAL investors who hold Italian government bonds through the two
international clearing systems, Cedel and Euroclear, will now be able to
reclaim withholding tax on their investments, following an agreement reached
with the Italian authorities.
Delays and difficulty in reclaiming the tax, which currently stands at 12.5
per cent, has traditionally been one of the main factors discouraging
foreign fund managers from investing in Italy.
Rules introduced a year ago to make it easier for investors to reclaim the
tax failed to meet many of the concerns of foreign fund managers, since they
excluded market participants which have their tax residence in a different
country from their clearing system or global custodian.
In the summer, a group of banks, brokers and clearing houses announced they
had set up a group to negotiate with the Italian authorities to resolve
resulting difficulties.
Although some details have to be finalised, the agreement with Italy has
been concluded in principle, Euroclear said.
