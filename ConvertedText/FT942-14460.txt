FT  20 APR 94 / International Company News: Pittencrieff demerger to be
delayed by a week


The demerger of Pittencrieff, which is splitting its natural resources
division from its US-based telecommunications business, is to be delayed by
a week following a Dollars 51.8m (Pounds 35.4m) deal in the US.
Pittencrieff Communications, which is 54 per cent owned by the UK quoted
natural resources group, announced on Friday that it is buying 600 mobile
radio channels in the south-west US which will more than double its
subscriber base.
As a result, documents detailing the demerger due to be posted on Thursday
will not now be sent before next week. 'It is a bit annoying,' said one of
the company's advisers yesterday. 'It is like going through divorce
proceedings and suddenly finding out that your partner is really good in
bed.'
The company said the financial structure of the demerger remains unaffected,
although it is likely the acquisition will have to be approved by the parent
company's shareholders.
Pittencrieff is proposing to change its name to Pittencrieff Resources and
will apply for a London listing.
Pittencrieff Communications will be sold through a placing and open offer
and quoted both on Nasdaq in the US and in the UK.
