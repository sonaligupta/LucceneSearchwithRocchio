FT  23 JUL 94 / Week in the Markets: Coffee down but frost fears remain


   By RICHARD MOONEY


London coffee traders were yesterday ensuring that they would not catch a
cold if there was another frost in Brazil over the weekend.
The selling that had driven the London Commodity Exchange's September
robusta futures price down by more than Dollars 350 a tonne dried up in
mid-week and yesterday's close of Dollars 3,640 was Dollars 170 off the low.
Traders had not changed their minds about the market, however; they still
thought a retracement justified after the recent spectacular surge to 8-year
highs. The main reason for the buying was determination not to have to
repeat the undignified scramble for cover that followed this year's second
damaging Brazilian frost two weeks ago.
No frost is predicted for this weekend, but traders were taking no chances.
'If there's no frost then we could see Dollars 50 on the downside next
week,' on told the Reuters news agency. 'But if there is frost it's going to
shoot up Dollars 500.'
Cocoa emerged from coffee's shadow at the LCE on Monday morning when the
September futures position jumped more than Pounds 40 to a 6 1/2 -year high
of Pounds 1,112 a tonne. The move above Pounds 1,000 attracted sellers,
however, as did subsequent forays. Only on Thursday did the price close
above that level and by yesterday's close it was back to Pounds 1,092, up
Pounds 24 overall.
Monday's move had been triggered three days earlier when New York cocoa
futures shot up in last minute trading. As with most commodity price surges
of late, investment fund buying was mainly responsible.
The bulls were not dismayed at their failure to break decisively through the
Dollars 1,000 barrier. 'The fundamental picture is of continuing deficit
with rising consumption, pointing to higher prices,' one trader told
Reuters. 'The market remains buoyant and we're seeing a consolidation
phase,' explained another.
At the London Metal Exchange copper's leap on Wednesday to a two-year high
failed to inspire the other base metals markets.
Once again it was to investment fund buying that the three months delivery
position's Dollars 77.50 rise was attributed. Dealers suggested that the
fund managers had tired of the palladium market, which they recently drove
to a five-year high, and decided to turn their attention to another metal
that would benefit from increased international economic activity.
The uptrend was not maintained, but the copper price did manage to
consolidate above the psychologically significant Dollars 2,500 level. It
closed yesterday at Dollars 2,514.50 a tonne, up Dollars 30.75 on the week
but Dollars 42.50 off the high.
In contrast to last week, when it reached a 39-month high and flirted with
overhead resistance at Dollars 1,550 a tonne for three months delivery, the
aluminium market ended this week testing support above Dollars 1,500 a
tonne.
The market seemed to take little comfort from a pledge by the leading
producing countries to maintain the voluntary agreement that is seeking to
cut world production by up to 2m tonnes for two years.
Delegates at a meeting in Canberra heard that Russia, while contributing to
the output cuts, albeit at a slower rate than it had agreed, was still
exporting as much as ever, and this can have done little to bolster
sentiment.
News yesterday of another big cut in LME warehouse stocks was ignored as the
aluminium price fell Dollars 22.50 to Dollars 1,510 a tonne, down Dollars
34.50 on the week.
