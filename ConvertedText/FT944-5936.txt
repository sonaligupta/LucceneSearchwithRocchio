FT  01 DEC 94 / People: Guinness - Irwin's move on record


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


Christopher Irwin, the first chief executive of BBC World Service
Television, has been appointed managing director of Guinness Publishing, the
book publishing arm of the drinks group.
Irwin, 46, has spent most the past 20 years working for the BBC and was one
of those involved in the early attempts to get satellite broadcasting
launched in the UK. Later he advised Pearson, owner of the Financial Times,
on its move into British Satellite Broadcasting, one of the forerunners of
BSkyB.
The new managing director of Guinness Publishing was a key figure in the
founding of BBC World Service Television, which is now expanding around the
globe. Irwin has been on 'gardening leave' from the BBC since May when his
job disappeared in a reorganisation of all the overseas activities of the
Corporation carried out by Bob Phillis, the BBC deputy director general.
A settlement was finally reached between Irwin and the BBC last week on what
are believed to be amicable terms.
Guinness Publishing, whose most important title is the Guinness Book of
Records, says part of Irwin's role would be to take Guinness Publishing into
the 'new media' although the company has already published a CD-ROM of the
Book of Records. The Guinness publishing arm produces dozens of other titles
 -mostly spin-offs from the Book of Records.
