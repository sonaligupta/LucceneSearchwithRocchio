TEAMS OF nuclear experts have started long-term safety work at eight
civilian plants in Russia and Ukraine, Sir Leon Brittan, the EC's external
economic relations commissioner, announced yesterday.
The European engineers and scientists would remain on site for periods of up
to 12 months at six high-risk plants in Russia and two in Ukraine, he said.
'I believe we have broken the ice in our relations with the nuclear
establishment in Russia and Ukraine.'
The engineers will work on improving fire-fighting, emergency power supply
and cooling systems at plants in Balakovo, Beloyarsk, Kola, Kalinin,
Smolensk, and Sosnovy Bor in Russia, as well as Rovno and south Ukraine.
The European Commission has agreed to allow its consultants to contract
'substantial' work to specialised Russian companies and institutes.
The EC is committed to spending Ecu333m (Pounds 262m) for making older
Soviet-built reactors safe. Total earmarked EC aid, including member states'
contributions, is Ecu432m.
The dispatch of private sector experts follows a bilateral deal on legal
indemnity in the event of accident. Russia and Ukraine have agreed to accept
liability on condition the Europeans do not make basic changes in plant
operation or equipment.
