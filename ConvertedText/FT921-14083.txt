FT  17 JAN 92 / Poles 'oppose general strike'


   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI


   WARSAW


Two-thirds of Poles oppose a general strike, according to a
government-conducted opinion poll, writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw.
The left-wing OPZZ trade union movement and the Solidarity trade union have
staged token stoppages over energy price rises introduced on January 1.
OPZZ, which has 4.7m members, yesterday claimed widespread support for its
action as the government, led by Mr Jan Olszewski, repeated it would not
give way. Solidarity's leaders are to meet on Tuesday to consider calling a
general strike.
