FT  01 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Housing lenders still strong,
says report


   By DAVID BARCHARD


DESPITE the housing market recession, the UK's traditional providers of
housing finance, the large building societies and Abbey National, are far
stronger than generally realised, a report published today says.
The report's author, Mr John Wriglesworth, housing finance analyst at UBS
Phillips & Drew, says he believes that even very small building societies
perform just as well as the large ones.
'Short of a complete meltdown in the housing market after some disaster like
a 20 per cent fall in house prices, we are not expecting any more top
building societies to get into a position where they have to be rescued,' Mr
Wriglesworth says.
Mr Wriglesworth expects total bad debt provisions by societies to jump to
Pounds 1.17bn this year, or around Pounds 1.3bn if Abbey National is
included.
Although building societies have never before had such a high proportion of
bad debts on their books, they have only a quarter of the bad debts of the
banks. Bad debts make up around 0.7 per cent of the loans of the 20 top
societies while they are 2.78 per cent of lending by the Big Four banks.
