FT  19 APR 94 / UK Company News: Morgan Crucible rises to Pounds 66m -
Strength shown in final quarter continues into current year


   By DAVID WIGHTON


Morgan Crucible, the speciality materials group, reported an 8 per cent
increase to Pounds 66m in pre-tax profits for the year to January 4 after a
strong final quarter.
Mr Bruce Farmer, managing director, said that a 'very changeable' year had
ended on a high note with the trend continuing into the current period.
'Some improvements in demand are beginning to show through in the UK and
Australia and the worst of the recession on the Continent now appears to be
over.' Mr Farmer also hinted that a decision was close on the future of Holt
Lloyd, the car care chemicals subsidiary where profits almost doubled to
Pounds 7.7m (Pounds 4.1m) on sales of Pounds 99m.
'If it was sold the way I want it would not dilute earnings this year,' he
said.
The group, which generates 85 per cent of turnover outside the UK, increased
sales by 16 per cent to Pounds 793.3m (Pounds 684m). Excluding the impact of
exchange rate movements and acquisitions, the rise was 6 per cent with order
intake up 6.5 per cent.
Operating profits rose by 15 per cent to Pounds 81.1m (Pounds 70.7m),
showing underlying growth of just under 3 per cent. The interest bill jumped
to Pounds 15.9m (Pounds 9.3m) but should fall this year.
Operating margins slipped to 10.2 per cent (10.3 per cent) but Mr Farmer
said that price increases were now sticking and predicted that margins could
recover to between 13 and 14 per cent in two to three years time.
All the group's four divisions reported higher profits including thermal
ceramics which, in spite of 'very difficult' conditions in continental
Europe during the first half, contributed Pounds 22.3m (Pounds 20.8m). The
carbon division, which made Pounds 17.3m (Pounds 15.6m), did not experience
the downturn on the Continent until the second half.
Earnings per share rose 7 per cent to 20p (18.7p) and the dividend is held
at 12.6p with a proposed final of 6.85p.
Operating cash flow nearly doubled to Pounds 112m and there was a net cash
inflow of Pounds 200,000 compared with an outflow of Pounds 55.6m in 1992.
COMMENT
Thanks to its international expansion Morgan Crucible has had a less
traumatic time in this recession than a decade ago and with 39 per cent of
its sales in the Americas and 9 per cent in east Asia it looks pretty
well-placed for the 1990s. It is already reaping the rewards in China, where
it got in ahead of the crowd, and is now planning a green field carbon plant
in Vietnam. Despite this continued investment it is finally generating cash
and with a sale of Holt Lloyd likely to raise more than Pounds 80m fears of
yet another rights issue have at last been laid to rest. The shares have
bubbled up in response, adding another 1p to 381p yesterday. They may settle
now given the premium rating of 17.5 on top of the range forecasts of Pounds
73m for this year.
