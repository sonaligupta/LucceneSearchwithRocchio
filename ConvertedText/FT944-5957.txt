FT  01 DEC 94 / The Budget: Public sector fears jobs toll


   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Employment Editor


Public sector workers may face nearly 250,000 job losses if their pay is to
keep pace with government forecasts for pay rises in the private sector in
1995-96.
Official estimates published with the Budget predict that average earnings
in the next financial year will rise by as much as 4.5 per cent, compared
with a 3.5 per cent average earnings increase expected for the current
financial year.
The Treasury is determined to maintain its four-year pay bill freeze for the
UK's 5.5m public sector workers and insists on a 10 per cent cut in real
terms in public service running costs over the same period. It is planned to
reduce government department running costs in cash terms from Pounds 15bn in
1994-95 to Pounds 14.6bn in 1997-98. Local authority spending is to be
frozen at the Pounds 73.4bn figure for the current financial year through
1995-96.
In the first 18 months of the public sector pay policy that came into force
in November 1992 more than 420,000 jobs disappeared from the public sector,
helping to fund pay rises and enabling public sector wage settlements to
keep broadly in line with those in the private sector.
Mr Chris Trinder, research director of the Public Finance Foundation, said
yesterday that it would need an added Pounds 450m in spending in the public
sector to fund earnings increases of 4.5 per cent.
He said: 'The only way this could be done is by reducing dramatically the
number of jobs in the public sector, unless the government expects to see a
widening gap between wage rises in the private and public services.
'It is simply not possible to achieve efficiency savings as high as 4.5 per
cent in a single year. Every 1 per cent rise in earnings means the loss of
around 50,000 public sector jobs.'
The Red Book issued with Mr Kenneth Clarke's Budget says: 'Central
government departments are expected to offset, or more than offset, pay and
price increases through efficiencies and other economies. Budgetary
provision for the rest of the public sector has been set on a comparable
basis.'
In its analysis of the Budget the Trades Union Congress estimates that the
planned cuts in public capital spending in the next three years - which
amount to a 12 per cent reduction in real terms or the equivalent of Pounds
3.6bn - will lead to 160,000 jobs being lost across the economy.
The TUC calculates that the four-year freeze on cash spending of government
departments will lead to a reduction of a further 100,000 jobs.
It says: 'The chancellor referred to civil service numbers falling
'significantly' below 500,000 over the next four years. As the original
plans envisaged staffing levels of 524,000 by 1996-97, it is clear that the
staffing reductions must be far more severe to meet the chancellor's
expectations.'
