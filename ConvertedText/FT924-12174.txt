FT  22 OCT 92 / MP sees hand of Treasury at work


   By DAVID OWEN


MR DAVID HOWELL, a former Conservative energy secretary, told the Commons
yesterday that he detected the hand of the Treasury in last week's pit
closure announcement, David Owen writes. 'I suspect that if we follow back
the powder trail from where the explosion took place last week, it will lead
to the Treasury,' he said in the coal debate.
Describing the proposed closures as the first of a series of unpopular
decisions to arise from this year's tough public spending round, he
questioned government reforms in the way the round is conducted.
In particular, he urged the government to treat 'the idea of a rigid control
total' with 'very great care as a concept', noting: 'We tried it in 1982-83
and it didn't work.'
In times of deflation, he said, public spending should be 'determined by
what can be prudently financed'. He added: 'Until we depoliticise the
announcement of our short-term interest rates, we will continue to have
difficulties.'
