FT  26 OCT 92 / Letter: Implications of floating exchange rate on Bank of
England independence


   From Sir ALAN WALTERS


Sir, It is some years since I have been able to agree wholeheartedly with a
leader in the Financial Times. It is a pleasure to say that I find virtually
nothing to quarrel with in 'A new policy framework' (October 21) - except
that it is a few years late.
In addition to a 'thorough investigation into the decisions associated with
the UK's membership of the ERM', I believe it is important to examine the
decisions from 1985 and particularly from 1987 when Nigel (now Lord) Lawson
pitched Britain into the ERM in all but name.
Many, myself included, have suggested that the Bank of England be given more
or less complete independence in conducting monetary policy rather than
serve merely as adviser to the Treasury. But if we are still en route to
Maastricht, as the prime minister says, and we do not invoke the opt-out
provision, then the Bank will be merely an operating arm of the European
Central Bank with no independence at all.
If, on the other hand, we rejoin the ERM, whether we opt out or not, then
again it is difficult to see what independence the Bank can have under such
a closely pegged, even fixed, exchange rate regime.
Only if we continue to float can a Bank of England have real responsibility
for monetary policy. The notable examples of independent central banks which
you mention, the US and Germany, have floating exchange rates. So the Fed
and Bundesbank can pursue monetary policies suitable for their own domestic
conditions.
Because of the possibility of breakdown on both Maastricht and the ERM as we
know it, and because it is possible that Britain will have a floating rate
regime, I think it is wise to consider the implications in terms of an
independent Bank.
