FT  01 NOV 93 / Small business finance is 'shaky'


   By EMMA TUCKER


SMALL-COMPANY finances are built on 'shaky foundations', says a report
issued today which presents a worrying picture of the state of the
small-business sector, Emma Tucker writes.
The report, by the 3i/ Cranfield European Enterprise Centre, says that small
companies suffer from serious structural weaknesses which carry policy
implications for the government and banks.
By comparing the financial structure of small and large companies, the
report concludes that small companies have weak liquidity and a considerably
lower ratio of fixed assets, which makes it difficult for them to raise
finance from banks. Lower and more volatile profitability add to these
difficulties.
Small companies are too dependent on short-term finance, with 'cheap but
very risky' trade credit as their main source which contributes to poor
liquidity, it says.
This lack of security is reflected in high interest rates for small
companies. The authors urge the government to consider a direct subsidy to
the banks to compensate for risk.
