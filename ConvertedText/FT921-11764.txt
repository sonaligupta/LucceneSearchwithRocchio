FT  30 JAN 92 / International Company News: Ambroveneto approves plan to
take stake in ISA

BANCO Ambrosiano Veneto (Ambroveneto), Italy's biggest private-sector
financial institution, has approved plans to buy a minority stake in ISA,
the holding company which controls Banca di Trento e Bolzano, a large north
Italian regional bank.
The purchase, subject to regulatory approval, marks another step in
Ambroveneto's expansion after last year's acquisition of Citibank Italia and
50 per cent of Caboto, a Milan securities trading firm.
The 20 per cent stake in ISA was sold by Edizione Holding, the holding
company of the Benetton family who have been divesting their interests in
financial services to concentrate on their clothing and sports goods
activities. No price has been disclosed, but reports suggest the stake was
sold for around L60bn (Dollars 50m).
Banca di Trento e Bolzano, which had deposits of L1,642bn in 1990, has
around 50 branches in the Trento and Alto Adige regions.
Ambroveneto's purchase may mark the first step towards taking full control
of the bank. Among other shareholders in ISA are Banca San Paolo di Brescia
and Mittel, two financial institutions largely controlled by Ambroveneto's
chairman, Mr Giovanni Bazoli.
