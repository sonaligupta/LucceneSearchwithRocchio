FT  26 MAY 93 / Observer: Allied search


With Peter Sutherland, Ireland's former EC commissioner, seemingly bagging
the Gatt job, Ireland's biggest company, Allied Irish Banks, will have to
find a new chairman. Sutherland, who joined AIB in October 1989, has been a
more active chairman than his predecessor and there is no obvious successor
with the same political connections - unless AIB were to poach Ray MacSharry
from rival Bank of Ireland.
One possibility is that Gerry Scanlan, AIB's chief executive, takes the job.
He retires in less than a year's time and is already deputy chairman.
However, this would be a break with tradition and the smart money in Dublin
is on industrialist Jim Culliton, 58, adding the chairmanship to his growing
portfolio.
