FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Seafield ahead to Pounds 1.62m


Pre-tax profits of Seafield Resources, the USM-quoted oil and gas
exploration company, rose from Pounds 1.06m to Pounds 1.62m in the year to
end-December.
At the operating level profits were up from Pounds 632,000 to Pounds 1.5m.
Turnover grew by 39 per cent from Pounds 5.55m to Pounds 7.74m, the bulk of
which - Pounds 6.8m - was generated in the UK from the group's 5 per cent
interest in the Victor gas field.
As part of last year's overhaul of North Sea taxation rules, companies were
prevented from offsetting exploration and appraisal spending against income
from fields which incur Petroleum Revenue Tax.
Although the terms were ultimately modified to include a limited form of
transitional relief, the outcome this time suffered from a surge in the tax
charge from Pounds 200,000 to Pounds 967,000. This impacted on earnings,
which fell from 1.7p to 1.3p.
Operating cash flow was up 82 per cent at Pounds 4.84m (Pounds 2.66m).
Mr John Raitt, chairman, said that hydrocarbons had been encountered in all
five UK wells in which the company participated.
Two of these wells were significant discoveries, and one successfully
appraised an extension to the Victor field, confirming additional reserves.
The balance sheet remained strong with no debt, he added.
The company said it intended to apply for a full listing when the
simplified, low cost, procedure for USM companies had been finalised.
