FT  29 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Negotiations on a new
market-stabilising coffee agreement


   By REUTER


A SECOND set of negotiations on a new market-stabilising international
coffee agreement, being held this week in London, should serve to clear the
ground for the September council of the International Coffee Organisation,
delegates said, reports Reuter. 'I believe the fact people are prepared to
come here is very meaningful. It would be cynical to attend if we do nothing
at all,' said Mr Valdemar Carneiro Leao, a spokesman for coffee producers
and Brazil's London ICO representative.
