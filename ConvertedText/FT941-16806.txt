FT  07 JAN 94 / International Company News: Hewlett-Packard to take stake in
software venture


   By ALAN CANE


Hewlett-Packard, a leading US electronics manufacturer, is to take a 15 per
cent equity stake in Taligent, a joint venture between International
Business Machines and Apple Computer. The value of the deal will not be
revealed.
Taligent, formed in March 1992, is developing advanced computer software
which IBM and Apple hope will be used to operate the next generation of
personal computers and workstations.
More than 90 per cent of personal computers use operating systems developed
by Microsoft of the US, the world's largest software house.
The involvement of HP, which unlike IBM has successfully maintained
profitability throughout the recession, gives fresh weight and credibility
to the Taligent venture.
Mr Bernard Guidon, HP's computer systems director for Europe, said yesterday
the company would work with Taligent to develop its 'object-oriented'
technology.
Object technology - in which programs are constructed from re-usable
software components - is seen as an important solution for companies
developing new software and replacing obsolete programs.
Mr Guidon said HP would run Taligent's software on its own computers and
would supply Taligent with its distributed computing technology. Distributed
computing expertise is essential for companies attempting to build
enterprise-wide networks.
