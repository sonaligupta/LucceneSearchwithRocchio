FT  27 JUL 92 / Car trade warns over tax proposals


   By JOHN GRIFFITHS


MOTOR TRADE leaders fear Inland Revenue proposals to be published this week
on taxation of company cars could delay a recovery in the UK fleet market
until next year.
Fleet operators are worried by indications that the document will include an
un-desirably long and detailed consultation process.
Mr Stewart Whyte of the Association of Car Fleet Operators said: 'We need to
know what the final formula is to be at the earliest date possible.'
Some fleet executives believe that if the consultation takes several months,
carmakers already suffering from severely depressed sales could be affected
for even longer.
'If the consultation process were to run up to December, there would almost
certainly be hardly any fleet sales right through the first quarter of next
year as well,' said Mr Whyte.
'Business car buyers, having been deterred from making purchase decisions
until the tax formula was thrashed out, would then be highly likely to put
off buying for a few more months, figuring that they might as well wait
until they know what's in the next Budget as well', said Mr Whyte.
The document has already caused concern within the industry because it is
understood to propose retaining a car-price banding system for assessing tax
liability - albeit a more sophisticated one than at present.
The latter has been heavily criticised for failing to discriminate between
essential and 'perk' car users, as well as placing some carmakers at a
disadvantage.
Under the present system, the amount of tax payable by a company car user on
the benefit of the private use of his or her case is calculated according to
a scale involving engine capacity, age, purchase price and business mileage.
