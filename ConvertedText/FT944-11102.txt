FT  08 NOV 94 / Gas industry tiptoes into free market: Ministerial caution
will dictate the choice of testing ground


   By ROBERT CORZINE


There is growing speculation that procedures for introducing competition
into the domestic gas market could be tested in south-west England.
Ofgas, the industry regulator, says a site has yet to be selected. But
industry executives say parts of the south-west, such as Bristol, might be
chosen for political reasons.
Conservative MPs in the region have been vociferous in questioning the
benefits of the planned liberalisation of the national market in 1998. They
fear that consumers in the region, which is the furthest from the main
coastal gas terminals, will suffer sharp price rises with the end of British
Gas's monopoly and the withdrawal of uniform, national pricing.
According to industry executives choosing the south-west for the proposed
pilot project would be politically astute. They say that since the region is
likely to benefit least from competition, it should benefit first.
Independent gas companies, keen for the national market of 18m households to
be opened to competition, would have a big incentive to ensure that gas
prices in the pilot area fell substantially.
Speculation about which region would be chosen has increased with industry
confidence that a new gas bill will be included in the government's
legislative programme to be announced in the Queen's Speech next week.
Fears that competition would lead to higher rather than lower prices for
many domestic customers had threatened to erode government support for the
liberalisation programme announced last December by Mr Michael Heseltine,
trade and industry secretary.
Recent hearings by the Commons trade and industry committee highlighted MPs'
fears about future gas prices. The issue formed much of the questioning
directed at witnesses including Mr Tim Eggar, industry and energy minister,
and Ms Clare Spottiswoode, industry regulator.
Their reassurances that competition should result in lower prices helped
remove lingering fears among ministers that gas liberalisation could be
politically explosive so close to a general election.
The heavily revised and much more cautious approach to the phased opening of
the market announced by Mr Eggar last week is likely to have reassured
ministers.
Under the revised proposals the government has abandoned plans to open 5 per
cent of the market in April 1996, and a further 5 per cent in April 1997.
The original plan raised serious doubts among British Gas executives, who
earlier this year called for a six-month delay to ensure the new procedures
and systems required by competition were fully tested.
Mr David Dewar, director of development at TransCo, the British Gas pipeline
and storage division, said the decision to run much more modest pilot
programmes in specific areas is a 'much more practical and better way' to
test the new systems.
The first phase of the pilot programme is due to start in April 1996, and
will cover an area with about 500,000 gas consumers. The second phase,
scheduled for April 1997, will include a whole region, containing about 2m
consumers.
Ofgas and the government say competition could be introduced nationally in
1998 if the pilots prove successful.
Mr James Ball, of the industry newsletter Gas Matters, believes the more
cautious approach does not represent any reduced commitment to full
competition by the Department of Trade and Industry and Ofgas. Instead, it
reflects a realisation that the original plan was 'a grand vision that could
not be guaranteed to work'.
The new arrangements are 'driven by practical reality', he said. 'They are
testable and controllable. You can stop it and make changes if it isn't
working.'
He said many in the industry were unhappy with the new arrangements, which
because of their limited nature would not give British Gas's would-be rivals
any significant commercial boost.
Ms Caroline Harper, of Amerada Hess, the US oil company which is keen to
expand its British gas business, said: 'We would have preferred to go for 5
per cent. But (the new arrangements) are the price we have to pay for full
competition in 1998.'
Mr Ball believes any legislation which emerges in the next parliamentary
session should merely provide a framework for liberalisation, to allow Ofgas
maximum flexibility in opening the market.
Others disagree and want the legislation to include a firm date for full
competition.
The chief executive of one of the bigger independent gas marketing companies
said yesterday: 'We're hoping that the gas act is crystal clear about the
date for introducing full competition. It's time the gas industry stopped
being a political football.'
