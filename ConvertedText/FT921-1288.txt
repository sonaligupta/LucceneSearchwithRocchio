FT  25 MAR 92 / UK Company News: TT on prowl after 40% rise


   By PEGGY HOLLINGER


TT GROUP, the acquisitive industrial holding company, yesterday unveiled a
40 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 14.6m for the year to December
28.
The group, which has sparked speculation about its next takeover move
through purchasing stakes in Renold and ML Holdings, said it was 'in a
strong position to embark on a major acquisition at the appropriate time'.
Mr John Newman, a director, said the group's next purchase would be 'another
company which is well established in its market but which is not performing
as well as it should do'. Both Renold, which makes chains and gears for
power transmission equipment, and ML Holdings, the aerospace and electronic
components company, reported losses in their last set of results.
TT's profits growth was due to the inclusion for 12 months of Crystalate,
the electronic components maker acquired for Pounds 34m in cash and shares
in August 1990. Crystalate's Pounds 90m sales contribution also fuelled the
58 per cent rise in group turnover to Pounds 158m.
The industrial division, including Crystalate, increased its profit
contribution from Pounds 2.6m to Pounds 7.8m, largely through improved
margins. In the first half of 1990, before joining TT, Crystalate had
reported a Pounds 900,000 loss.
Mr Newman said the group's profits growth in the current year would come
from an improvement in Crystalate's US division.
The packaging division returned Pounds 8.4m in profits compared with Pounds
7.9m, while building services fell slightly, from Pounds 1.7m to Pounds
1.67m.
Interest charges jumped from Pounds 1.8m to Pounds 3.23m because of the debt
acquired through Crystalate and the Pounds 3m cost of buying a 40 per cent
stake in Magnetic Materials Group. Gearing fell by five points to 39 per
cent.
Earnings per share rose from 14p to 15.1p. The final dividend is increased
by 10 per cent to 3.3p, bringing the total for the year to 5.5p (5p).
COMMENT
TT is back on the prowl and whether it goes for ML or Renold first will
probably depend on which is the cheapest and least resistant. Either group
would fit into the TT philosophy, although ML has the edge with about 22 per
cent of its business in electronic components. What is not in doubt is that
TT needs another acquisition to show significant growth this year. Forecasts
are for a 9 per cent rise to Pounds 16m. At this level, the shares are
trading on a multiple of just over 12. Although the price could be capped in
the short-term by an acquisition for paper, the record at Crystalate bodes
well for the next acquisition and for the shares in the medium-term.
