FT  24 NOV 92 / Barclays staff protest at cuts


   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent


BANKING unions protested yesterday as Barclays Bank told staff that an
acceleration of its job-cutting efforts meant it could no longer guarantee
that all redundancies would be voluntary.
The Barclays Group Staff Union said it would 'not remain impassive' if there
were compulsory redundancies.
Barclays confirmed that it expected to lose 3,000 more jobs by the end of
1995 than its estimate last year of 15,000. It said it had already shed
9,000 staff through natural wastage and voluntary redundancy. Barclays told
the financial services union Bifu that yesterday's announcement may not be
the end of job losses. It said the 18,000 programme by 1995 was not a
ceiling - 'it could go higher'. Bifu has estimated that 27,000 banking jobs
were lost last year.
Barclays said it would continue to rely on voluntary schemes and cuts in
recruitment to reduce numbers, but said it 'realistically cannot guarantee
that the level of take-up will be sufficient to achieve the necessary
reductions'.
Mr Iain MacLean, assistant general secretary of the Barclays staff union,
said it was 'trying to persuade the board forcefully' that it should avoid
compulsory cuts.
Separately, Bifu said leaders of its TSB section had called for the
executive to approve a ballot for industrial action over the possibility of
compulsory redundancies among the planned 440 job losses.
The TSB's retail bank has already agreed redundancy terms with 80 senior
managers. It is trying to agree redundancy with 150 branch managers within
the next few months, and 120 computer and 80 clerical staff are also
affected.
