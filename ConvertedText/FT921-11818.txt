FT  30 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Japanese industrialists urge India to
extend its reforms


   By K K SHARMA


   NEW DELHI


A JAPANESE business mission has asked the Indian government to extend its
economic reforms and remove all restrictions on foreign equity, writes K K
Sharma in New Delhi.
India last year liberalised its foreign investment policy and now permits
foreign companies to hold a majority 51 per cent share in joint ventures, an
improvement on the previous ceiling of 40 per cent.
The Japanese mission, led by Mr Rohuro Ishikawa, chairman of the Japan-India
business co-operation committee, wants all restrictions on investment
removed. It has pointed out that other countries have removed such
restrictions and if India wants foreign investment, it must be competitive
and offer matching conditions.
The group of 50 Japanese industrialists also wants links between profit
repatriation and export earnings removed, easier imports of capital goods
and a revision of the foreign exchange rules.
