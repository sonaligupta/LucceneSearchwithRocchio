FT  05 AUG 92 / Consumer confidence falters: Japanese manufacturers expected
to cut capital spending further in sluggish economy

JAPANESE consumer confidence has been undermined by concerns about the
slowing economy and, in particular, a fall in new jobs, the Economic
Planning Agency (EPA) said yesterday.
The agency's consumer confidence index in the April-to-June quarter was down
0.4 to 42.3. That movement reinforced the recent judgment of the Bank of
Japan and the Ministry of Finance that consumers are unlikely to lead an
economic recovery in coming months.
Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, said a sharp fall in new job offers
in recent months had increased pessimism. However, he said fears of a bad
debt crisis facing Japanese financial institutions were unfounded. Financial
institutions had co-operated in the past to overcome difficulties and 'such
co-operation will continue', he declared, adding that reserves would cushion
institutions against the increase in non-performing loans.
The EPA also released a separate survey suggesting that manufacturing
companies would continue to reduce capital spending by an average 2.8 per
cent over the second half of this year, compared to the first half.
The agency said the largest falls would be in precision machinery, down 14.8
per cent, electrical machinery, down 28.5 per cent, and non-ferrous metals,
down 37 per cent.
However, capital spending by non-manufacturing companies was expected to
rise by 6.5 per cent, with wholesalers, retailers and restaurants
forecasting a 28 per cent increase.
About 36 per cent of companies said the economy would continue to slow
during the second half, while only 3 per cent thought it would recover, the
EPA found.
The agency said 46 per cent of companies reported that the economic
conditions had deteriorated during the first half, while 1 per cent said
there was an improvement.
