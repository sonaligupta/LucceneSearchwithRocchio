FT  15 JUN 93 / Britain wins EC reprieve for big motorcycles


   By ANDREW HILL

BRITISH motorcycle enthusiasts have won a reprieve until the end of the
century from technical rules which would ban the sale of high-powered
machines in the European Community.
EC internal market ministers agreed yesterday on a 100 brake horsepower
limit for motorcycles registered in the Community after December 31, 1994,
in spite of another large and noisy demonstration by motorcycle enthusiasts
in Luxembourg.
But member states will have the right to a five-year exemption from the
rules. In practice, only the UK is likely to exercise that right. Other
governments will not be able to prevent the riding of machines up to 125
brake horsepower, and motorcycles registered before the deadline will escape
the restrictions, but EC countries will be allowed to outlaw the
re-registration of high-powered motorcycles after 1994.
The UK has been vociferous in defence of the large motorcycles, which it
claims are sold to a specialised market of expert riders, and do not reduce
road safety in Europe.
The European Commission has been asked to submit a study of the safety
record of the high-powered motorcycles by 1998.
Triumph, the revitalised UK motorcycle manufacturer, is one company which
will benefit from the exemption. It hopes to produce nearly 7,000
motorcycles this year, but five of its eight models would be illegal under
the EC rules. Even under the exemption Triumph would be prevented from
exporting those machines to the rest of the EC after 1994.
EC cosmetics makers will be banned from testing products on animals from
January 1, 1998, if alternative methods have been developed. Ministers
yesterday formally adopted a directive on the free movement of cosmetics,
but without the stricter amendments proposed by the European Parliament in
April, which would have banned all animal tests from the year 2000.
