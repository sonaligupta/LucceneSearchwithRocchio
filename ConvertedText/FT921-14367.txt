FT  16 JAN 92 / Spain hits target


   By PETER BRUCE


   MADRID


Spanish inflation rose just 0.1 per cent in December to bring accumulated
inflation for the year to 5.5 per cent - the government's target, writes
Peter Bruce in Madrid. The figure means inflation is down a full point
compared with the end of 1990. The Madrid stock market rose sharply despite
the fact that underlying inflation for the year rose slightly.
