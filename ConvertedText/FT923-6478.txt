FT  24 AUG 92 / International Company News: McDonnell Douglas warns it will
make more lay-offs


   By REUTER


   ST LOUIS, HOUSTON


A MCDONNELL Douglas executive said declining commercial business and not
defence spending cuts were mainly responsible for its 33,864 job cuts over
the past two years, Reuter reports from St Louis.
Mr James Caldwell, director of new business development for the aerospace
contractor, told the Pentagon's Defence Conversion Commission that more
lay-offs would occur in the next two years as some Pentagon programmes were
terminated.
'Most of the job eliminations directly attributable to defence programme
cuts are still ahead of us, and will be felt with particular severity over
the next two years,' he said.
McDonnell had 99,096 people on its payroll in June, down from 132,960 in
June 1990 because of declining commercial business, divestitures and steps
to enhance global competitiveness, he said.
Mr Caldwell told the commission that it expected the US defence market to
remain sizeable in spite of budget cuts that could spark more lay-offs.
TENNECO said it completed its Dollars 3bn restructuring programme with the
sale of its pulp chemicals business to Sterling Chemicals for about Dollars
202m, Reuter reports from Houston.
The company said the Dollars 3bn in restructuring measures involved the sale
of non-core assets valued at Dollars 1.5bn, the issuing of Dollars 716m of
equity, capital spending cuts of Dollars 350m, and cost reductions of
Dollars 300m.
