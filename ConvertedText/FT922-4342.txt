FT  05 JUN 92 / Hanson and Bechtel in Canary Wharf talks


   By ROLAND RUDD and ALAN FRIEDMAN


   LONDON, NEW YORK


HANSON, the Anglo-US con-glomerate, and Bechtel, one of the world's top two
engineering and construction companies, are discussing the possibility of
combining forces over their approach to Canary Wharf, the insolvent office
project in London's docklands.
Lord White, chairman of Hanson Industries in the US and Lord Hanson's
partner, yesterday said: 'There is a possibility that we might establish a
joint venture in our approach to Canary Wharf.'
Hanson is considering making a bid for the project, which was put into
administration last week by Olympia & York, the Canadian-based property
developer.
In San Francisco, a spokesman for Bechtel said a representative of the US
group's property development and investment division had 'a preliminary
conversation with the Hanson group' a few days ago about Canary Wharf.
Bechtel said the discussion concerned how Bechtel Park Towers Limited
(BPTL), the property and investment division, 'might assist Hanson as it
considers the Canary Wharf project'. The services it might provide would
include development and property management services.
Hanson is also talking to Bechtel about the possibility of redeveloping
Hanson's Kaiser cement works on the Permanente Site, near San Jose in the
San Francisco Bay Area.
While the talks are still at an early stage, Lord White said Hanson might
establish a big property arm if the talks prove conclusive. 'There are a
number of interesting property bargains around which we may be interested
in,' he said.
Bechtel had 1991 revenues of Dollars 7.5bn and an order book at year-end
that totalled Dollars 7.2bn. BPTL has been active as developer/manager in
projects such as the construction of the 27-storey US federal courthouse in
lower Manhattan.
