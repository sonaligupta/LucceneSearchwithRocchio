FT  30 APR 94 / The Lex Column: British Gas


Mr Richard Giordano, the new British Gas chairman, certainly knows how to
put the skids under his own share price. A profits warning at the group's
annual general meeting knocked 5 per cent off Gas's shares on Thursday,
though they recovered 2 per cent yesterday. Mr Giordano's prediction that
profits this year will be lower than last year is real enough: the
continuing price cap on its domestic gas business and further loss of market
share in the contract market will see to that.
Mr Giordano also scared the market by saying he could not comment on
dividend prospects until the company's regulatory framework was more
settled. In particular, he made much of the danger that rivals might cherry
pick Gas's most attractive customers when its domestic monopoly is abolished
in 1996. Mr Giordano is certainly right to press his case so long as the
government continues to dither over when to publish its consultation
document on what the rules for the new competitive market should be.
Both Ofgas and the government believe competition should be introduced in an
even-handed fashion. Moreover, Ms Clare Spottiswoode, Ofgas's formidable
director-general, has threatened to publish the document herself if
ministers are still dithering after next Thursday's local elections. If
suggestions about what the document contains are accurate, Gas's shares
could be due for a bounce.
