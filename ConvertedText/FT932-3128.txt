FT  16 JUN 93 / Peace talks hear of Clinton-Assad letters


   By JUREK MARTIN


   WASHINGTON


THE TENTH round of the Middle East peace talks began in Washington yesterday
with the disclosure that President Bill Clinton and President Hafez al-Assad
of Syria have exchanged letters, presumably on the future status of the
Golan Heights.
A senior US official returning from Europe with Mr Warren Christopher, the
secretary of state, was quoted as saying that the exchanges were 'very
substantive,' but declined to furnish details.
They may cover possible US guarantees that the Golan Heights, if returned to
Syria, not be used as a base for attacks on Israel, as well as how much
territory Israel might be persuaded to give up.
The chief Syrian negotiator, Mr Muwaffiq al-Allaf, insisted yesterday that
Israel must surrender all the Golan Heights, seized in the 1967 war, or
accept responsibility for the breakdown of the peace talks.
His Israeli counterpart, ambassador Mr Itamar Rabinovich, said Israel had
told Syria it accepted 'the element of withdrawal' as part of the
peacemaking process but would not address 'the extent of the withdrawal
until certain questions are answered'.
Bilateral contacts between the US and other delegations have been frequent.
Mr Christopher conferred in Vienna, where he addressed the UN human rights
conference, with the Syrian, Egyptian and Israeli foreign ministers.
