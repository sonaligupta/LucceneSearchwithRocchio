FT  23 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Interest in National Express


   By ANDREW BOLGER


THERE HAS been considerable public interest in the flotation of National
Express, the scheduled coach service operator, which is expected to price
its shares tomorrow at between 160p-170p, valuing the group at about Pounds
60m, writes Andrew Bolger.
More than 7,000 people have called a freephone line to register for a
mini-prospectus for the flotation, many more than the company's advisers had
expected. The flotation will be through a placing and offer for sale, with
25 per cent of the shares being offered direct to the public.
