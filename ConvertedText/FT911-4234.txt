FT  20 APR 91 / International Company News: Degussa discloses 50% pre-tax
fall half-way

DEGUSSA, the German chemicals, metals, and pharmaceuticals group, yesterday
revealed that pre-tax profits fell by half in the first six months of the
fiscal year which ends September 1991.
Mr Gert Becker, chief executive, told the annual meeting he believed
earnings had 'bottomed out' and the result for the full year would be
'roughly a third below' the previous twelve months. In 1989-90 pre-tax
profits stood at DM318m (Dollars 190m).
Mr Becker attributed the poor performance to the same negative factors that
weighed on the company in the previous year, including the weak dollar,
recessionary trends in important export markets, and the collapse in eastern
European business. He added that internal restructuring in the metals
division was an extra cost this year.
Turnover in the first six months of fiscal 1990-91 reached DM6.5bn, an 8 per
cent decline, which the company blamed principally on weak precious metal
prices.
Total sales in all areas excluding precious metals trading were 2 per cent
lower.
Earnings from Asta Pharma and the dental division had improved, he said, in
contrast with the rest of the business, including the chemicals operation
where profits dropped 'considerably'.
Mr Becker did not comment as to whether Degussa would maintain last year's
dividend of DM11.
