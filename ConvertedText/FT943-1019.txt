FT  27 SEP 94 / Investment in Russia grows amid 'partnership' talk


   By LIAM HALLIGAN


The British and Russian governments yesterday became 'serious partners',
according to deputy prime minister Mr Alexander Shokhin, writes Liam
Halligan.
Speaking at the Russian embassy in London, Mr Shokhin said bilateral
consultations originally announced in May 1992 had come to fruition in the
form of a Dollars 800m (Pounds 506m) 'credit guarantee'.
Together with the UK president of the Board of Trade, Mr Michael Heseltine,
Mr Shokhin singled out British involvement in the development of Russia's
telecommunications infrastructure, the provision of medical and radiological
equipment and technical support for Russia's petrochemical industry.
Among other developments announced was the possibility of assistance with
the construction of a further international air terminal in Moscow in return
for the granting of extra corridors to British carriers. However, Mr Shokin
said that Aeroflot was not in agreement.
It was also announced that Mr Shokhin yesterday signed a Dollars 100m credit
facility with the EBRD to be followed up with a Dollars 200m package from
the World Bank. The latter will be signed in Washington today.
The Russian delegation also said it was now 'ready to declare repayments' of
some Dollars 600bn of commercial debt, including Dollars 200m owed to UK
companies.
