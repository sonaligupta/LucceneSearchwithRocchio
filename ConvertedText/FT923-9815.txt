FT  03 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Henlys wins orders of Pounds 17m


   By PEGGY HOLLINGER


HENLYS, the motor trader and coach manufacturer fighting a hostile Pounds
25m all-paper bid from rival T Cowie, has won its largest single order on
the back of a deal with unions for a two-year pay freeze.
The group announced orders for more than 370 buses and coaches worth some
Pounds 17m over the next 24 months. The largest order - 150 coaches for
Stagecoach Holdings - represented sales of about Pounds 7.5m.
The company's 700 employees at the Scarborough coach and bus factory agreed
on Friday to a series of measures, including the elimination of private and
permanent health insurance and a revised productivity bonus scheme.
