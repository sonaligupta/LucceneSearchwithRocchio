FT  05 JUN 92 / International Company News: KLM back in black after record
loss


   By RONALD VAN DE KROL


KLM ROYAL Dutch Airlines swung back into profit in 1991-92 after record
losses in the previous 12 months. The return to the black has prompted the
airline to resume dividend payments.
A cost-cutting programme and a higher proportion of first-class and
business-class travellers helped KLM post a net profit of Fl 125m (Dollars
69m) in the year to the end of March. In the previous year, KLM recorded net
losses of Fl 630m, nearly half of which were due to restructuring charges.
The airline, which is 38 per cent state-owned, is to pay a dividend of Fl 1
a share. It last paid a dividend two years ago, when shareholders received
Fl 1.80.
'Though 1991 was a bad year for the international airline industry, KLM
achieved 7 per cent traffic growth in 1991-92,' the company said.
Other factors behind the improvement were a 9 per cent increase in
productivity and a 7 per cent decline in fuel expenses. The company also
attributed the upturn to its pruning of unprofitable services and a trend
towards more long-haul flights.
The Dutch airline made no mention of the collapse of merger talks with
British Airways in February. However, KLM has said that it remains
interested in pursuing global partnerships, though it stresses that it is
under no time pressure to strike a deal.
The results, which were in line with analysts' forecasts, include book
profits of Fl 61m on the disposal of older aircraft and extraordinary gains
of Fl 48m, reflecting the sale of a 49 per cent stake in its helicopter
subsidiary and several other transactions.
Operating profits totalled Fl 416m, reversing the previous year's losses of
Fl 285m. However, financing charges rose by more than 50 per cent to Fl
253m, while holdings in non-Dutch airlines - Northwest of the US, Air
Littoral of France and Air UK - continued to generate substantial losses of
Fl 145m, little changed from the year before.
Total turnover rose by 21 per cent to Fl 7.91bn. Traffic revenue was up 18
per cent, excluding Transavia, the charter airline, and Air Littoral, both
of which were consolidated for the first time.
The revenue increase reflected both a 7 per cent rise in traffic as well as
a 10 per cent increase in yields generated mainly by higher-fare passengers.
Costs - up 10 per cent at Fl 7.49bn - rose less than half as fast as
turnover.
