FT  22 OCT 92 / UK Company News: First Maryland up 27% in third quarter


First Maryland Bancorp, the US subsidiary of Allied Irish Banks, reported
third quarter pre-tax profits of Dollars 37.6m (Pounds 21.8m), up some 27
per cent on the same stage of 1991.
The outcome contributed to a 43 per cent rise to Dollars 105.4m (Dollars
74m) in pre-tax profits for the nine months to September 30.
Mr Charles W Cole, First Maryland's president and chief executive, said:
'Improved interest margins and increases in fee income continue to
contribute to our momentum. Non-interest expense management has also
strengthened First Maryland's positive earnings trend in an environment of
sluggish loan demand.'
First Maryland has a 165-branch network, 142 in Maryland, 21 in
Pennsylvania, and one each in Delaware and Washington DC.
