FT  22 DEC 92 / Letter: Looked at from another angle


   From Ms MARY BERG


Sir, I do not know how many of the other 80 women members of the Society of
Business Economists share my view that 'women' is not 'the most pleasurable'
way of losing their reputations (Observer: 'Assumption', December 21).
However, I think we would all agree that forecasting is the surest,
especially forecasting exchange rates. Or is that included in gambling?
