FT  12 APR 94 / Russia sends plan to IMF


   By LEYLA BOULTON

The Russian government has delivered an economic action plan to the
International Monetary Fund in an effort to unlock a new Dollars 1.5bn
(Pounds 1.02bn) loan. A copy of the memorandum, agreed between Mr Victor
Chernomyrdin's government, the Russian central bank and IMF officials,
promises to lower inflation to 7 per cent a month by the end of this year.
The government undertakes to keep strict limits on the budget deficit, while
the central bank will keep its main discount rate at just 5 percentage
points below inter-bank interest rates.
The document reverses Mr Chernomyrdin's public declarations last winter that
he planned to fight inflation with 'non-monetary' means and exposes him to
suspicions by both conservatives and radical reformers of his true
intentions.
From this month, Moscow promises to abolish export quotas except on key
exports such as natural gas and crude oil. Having just promised to review
increases in import tariffs on food, the government says it will keep
tariffs at an average level of 15 per cent, and will produce by October 1 a
3-5 year timetable for the gradual reduction of these tariffs. General
undertakings include a promise to improve supervision of Russian commercial
banks, continuation of the privatisation drive and a new budgetary system
devolving responsibilities to Russia's regions.
