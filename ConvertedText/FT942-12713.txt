FT  28 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: No reason why savings should not be
delivered (1)


   From Mr D L GRAHAM


Sir, A report has highlighted that government agencies have spent more than
Pounds 500m on consultancies without checking whether they were receiving
value for money ('Whitehall waste over consultancy projects attacked', April
26).
This is not surprising. This company reduces overhead costs on a basis that
no fee is charged unless and until the client has actually saved money. As
might be expected, private firms welcome this. In contrast, when we recently
discussed how we work with a government agency, we were advised that 'no
savings - no fee' would be against official policy and that our proposal
would have to be restructured to provide for payment, irrespective of
results achieved.
How can government hope to improve its efficiency if it refuses to adopt the
management strategies of the private sector?
