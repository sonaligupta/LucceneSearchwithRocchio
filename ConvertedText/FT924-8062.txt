FT  13 NOV 92 / German tourists attacked in Egypt

   CAIRO


FIVE German tourists and two Egyptians were wounded yesterday when gunmen
described by police as Moslem militants opened fire on their bus in Qena in
the southern Nile valley, Reuter reports from Cairo.
It was the fourth serious attack on tourists since Moslem militants fighting
an underground war with the government warned in September that tourists
would not be safe in Qena province, site of some of Egypt's most famous
Pharaonic temples and tombs.
An interior ministry statement blamed 'extremist elements,' the authorities'
usual term for Moslem militants. It said five Germans, the Egyptian driver
and an Egyptian passer-by had been injured.
The government has reacted vigorously to the spate of attacks on tourists,
promising to fly helicopter patrols over tourist areas and vowing even
tougher police measures against the militants.
This week it announced that all mosques would be put under state control and
police rounded up 150 militants in the province of Assiut, the province
north of Qena and the main theatre of militant violence. Officials expect 4m
tourists to visit Egypt in the year to July 1993, earning the country
Dollars 4bn.
El-Gama'a el-Islamiya (the Islamic Group) has claimed responsibility for
three previous attacks on tourists.
