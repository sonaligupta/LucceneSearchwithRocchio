FT  13 APR 94 / People: Finn takes place in Yardley saga


Yardley Lentheric, the privately-owned UK perfume and cosmetics company, has
recruited a Unilever veteran as managing director. Richard Finn was until
January head of Chesebrough Ponds of the US, a Unilever subsidiary producing
skin creams and other personal products. A Unilever man of over 30 years'
standing, he has worked in the UK, the US, France, India and Nigeria.
Finn's appointment raises a question about the direction Yardley is taking.
Although it operates internationally, Yardley is essentially a UK company,
based in Basildon in Essex. Its history is chequered: owned by the tobacco
giant BAT until 1984, it was then bought by the drugs group Beecham. In
1990, it was handed on to the US venture capitalists Wasserstein Perella.
In the same year, Wasserstein Perella bought Maybelline, a somewhat larger
US personal products company. In 1992 it floated Maybelline on the US stock
market, retaining a controlling stake. Some nine months ago, plans were
announced for Maybelline to acquire Yardley. According to Yardley, nothing
has yet been decided, though the plans remain in hand.
Where Finn will fit into the new arrangement is not yet clear. In the
meantime, Yardley chairman Randall Weisenburger  - who has been standing in
as interim managing director since last September  - says sales in 1993 were
12 per cent up on the year before.
