FT  23 OCT 92 / International Company News: US airline results reflect fares
war


   By KAREN ZAGOR


THE parlous state of the US airline industry was underscored yesterday by
the third quarter losses posted by Delta Air Lines and USAir Group, and by
the decline in profitability at Northwest Airlines.
Mr John Dasburg, Northwest's chief executive, criticised American Airlines'
summer fare sale for damaging the entire industry. 'Their actions drove the
entire industry under water during what normally is a profitable quarter,'
he said.
Mr Thomas Roeck, Delta's chief financial officer, also blamed fare slashing
during the peak summer travel season for the disappointing quarter, although
he did not point to a single culprit.
Delta, one of the three US 'mega-carriers,' unveiled a net loss of Dollars
106.7m, or Dollars 2.64 a share, compared with net income of Dollars 13.1m,
or 17 cents, last year. The company had an operating loss of Dollars 162.5m
in the three months compared with operating income of Dollars 26.6m a year
ago.
USAir Group, the US airline in which British Airways wants to invest Dollars
750m for a big minority stake, narrowed its third-quarter net loss to
Dollars 55.4m, or Dollars 1.45 a share, from a deficit of Dollars 81.4m, or
Dollars 2.06.
The company also reduced its operating loss in the three months, to Dollars
35.7m from Dollars 45.4m. Revenues advanced to Dollars 1.7bn from Dollars
1.6bn.
Mr Seth Schofield, chairman and chief executive who had blamed domestic fare
wars for the group's weak second-quarter results, said there was evidence of
fares returning to "more compensatory levels'.
The quarterly loss at the air line subsidiary also narrowed, to Dollars
58.3m, on revenues of Dollars 1.6bn, from Dollars 74m, on revenues of
Dollars 1.5bn the previous year.
Its operating loss stood at Dollars 44.5m in the quarter against Dollars 53m
a year earlier.
The passenger load factor stood at 65.4 per cent, up from 60.7 per cent last
year. For the first nine months, the group suffered a net loss of Dollars
203.3m, or Dollars 5.16, against one of Dollars 306.9m, or Dollars 7.40.
There were fewer shares outstanding in the 1991 period. Revenues rose to
Dollars 5.1bn from Dollars 4.8bn.
The airline unit had a net deficit of Dollars 191.1m in the first nine
months of 1992 on revenues of Dollars 4.7bn. This compares with a deficit of
Dollars 284m on revenues of Dollars 4.5bn last year.
Northwest Airlines, the fourth largest US carrier which was privatised in a
Dollars 3.65bn leveraged buy-out in 1989, saw third-quarter earnings decline
to Dollars 46.5m from Dollars 105.1m a year ago.
Revenues rose 3.4 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 2.22bn, while expenses
grew 8.3 per cent to Dollars 2.15bn.
