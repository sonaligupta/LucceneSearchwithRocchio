FT  20 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Lonrho steady


   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY


Mining group Lonrho held firm as Ashanti, the world's richest goldfield and
the group in which Lonrho has a 43 per cent stake, made its market debut.
The shares opened at Dollars 20.60 and, shortly after the official market
closed, they were trading at between Dollars 20.85 and Dollars 21, almost a
dollar above the market forecasts.
That leaves Lonrho with about Dollars 715m (Pounds 490m) against forecasts
of Dollars 600m. However, the market had already prepared itself for the
good news and Lonrho shares closed unchanged at 154p.
Investment interest burgeoned in Rolls-Royce after powerful figures from
Pratt and Whitney painted an optimistic picture for aerospace spare parts.
The fact that the US engines manufacturer reported a jump in sales of spare
parts after pushing up its prices by 5 per cent fuelled excitement among
aerospace analysts.
One said: 'Aerospace stocks are very sensitive to news on spare parts. The
fact that the market has absorbed a price rise by Pratt and Whitney and
sales have increased is very encouraging.'
Turnover of 14m shares passed through the market and Rolls improved 7 to
193p.
A market watcher said that, since aerospace companies were very
inter-related, shares of Rolls could not fail but get a large boost from the
Pratt figures. The optimism was compounded by recently reported good air
traffic figures from BAA, which itself enjoyed further positive sentiment in
the market following traffic figures for March. The shares improved a penny
to 983p.
Food retailers remained under a cloud, with NatWest Securities reiterating
its cautious stance on the sector. The broker underlined continuing concerns
over margins, pointing out that with sales increases proving difficult, cost
cutting remains the main route to growing profits.
Particularly vulnerable, according to NatWest, are Argyll, down 4 at 240p,
and J Sainsbury, off 6 at 359p. The broker is more positive over prospects
for Tesco, down 1 1/2 at 212p and Asda, off 1 3/4 at 56 1/4 p, although the
latter was said to be undermined by a Hoare Govett downgrading.
Discount food retailer Budgens weakened a further 2 to 27p following
Monday's profit warning.
Mostly positive comments from First Leisure on current trading helped the
shares add 2 to 318p. But Smith New Court, fretting over the continuing
weakness in the group's ten-pin bowling business, suggested investors turn
their attention to Rank Organisation, the shares jumping 12 to 430p on 2.3m
traded.
Among stores stocks, Argos was said to have benefited from a buy note from
SG Warburg. The shares climbed 4 to 364p. Similarly bullish noises on
Vendome, up 2 at 460p, were said to be coming from NatWest Securities.
Storehouse steadied after Monday's shock announcement of the resignation of
the Mothercare chief executive. The shares added a penny to 219p, with
NatWest, UBS and Warburg among those pointing out that the groundwork for
recovery had already been laid.
The awarding of a Portuguese bridge contract to a consortium led by
Trafalgar House helped move the shares ahead 2 1/2 to 104p.
Conglomerate BTR gained 7 to 386 1/2 p on unusually heavy turnover of 12m
shares as NatWest Securities added the group to its list of most highly
favoured stocks.
The house now forecasts group profits of Pounds 1.96bn in 1996, up from
Pounds 1.65bn in 1995 and Pounds 1.38bn this year. Dealers said BZW was also
a buyer.
Talk that it was poised to sell its loss-making parcels division helped
transport group NFC add 3 at 241p.
London International fell 8 to 121p after announcing it was to restructure
and refinance. The group said its share of the US branded condom market had
fallen by about 2 per cent over the past year. However, analysts said
pressure on the shares was mitigated by the result of the impending sale of
LIG's photo-processing business, which is expected shortly.
Hong Kong related banks HSBC and Standard Chartered dipped 10 to 757p and 26
to 1054p respectively following a sharp slide in the Hang Seng Index. Cable
and Wireless slipped 10 to 453p.
Merchant bank SG Warburg fell 14 to 738p on a downgrading from BZW.
RTZ, the world's biggest mining group, shed 15 to 835p on turnover of 12m
after Cazenove, the agency broker, confirmed that it had placed a line of 5m
shares in the company at 830p a share.
Encouraging figures from Merck, the big US pharmaceuticals group, gave some
heart to a despondent UK health sector. Merck announced that sales for its
first quarter were up 19 per cent after adjustments. Glaxo bounced 6 to 564p
and SmithKline Beecham improved 8 to 367p ahead of figures tomorrow.
Leading oil stocks held steady in spite of a weaker crude oil price and
market. BP, boosted by company presentations in Scotland, ended the day
unchanged at 386p while Shell Transport dipped 2 to 723p.
Advertising group WPP lifted 3 to regain a two-year high of 129p. The SG
Warburg media team, which had the group as its pick of the year, pointed out
that WPP had outperformed the All-Share Index by 87 per cent over the year
and 20 per cent over the last quarter.
Mobile telecoms group Vodafone was again weak with dealers blaming a stock
overhang. The shares slid 16 to 496p with 5.5m traded.
