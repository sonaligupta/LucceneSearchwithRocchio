FT  23 JUL 93 / Health service reforms hit drug sales


   By PAUL ABRAHAMS


DRUG sales in western Europe were virtually stagnant during the first five
months of the year, following health care reforms in Italy and Germany
earlier this year.
Sales to pharmacies in the seven largest markets in the five months to May
fell from Dollars 20.727bn (Pounds 13.8bn) last year to Dollars 19.422bn,
although after excluding exchange rate changes they increased 0.9 per cent,
according to IMS International, the London-based market research company.
That compares with 8 per cent growth for the whole of last year. The seven
countries represent about 85 per cent of west European sales. The German
market fell from Dollars 5.797bn last year to Dollars 5.18bn after the
introduction of reforms in January. The decline in local currency terms was
11.1 per cent.
Italian sales were also affected by reforms which took effect in April.
Revenues dropped from Dollars 4.708bn last year to Dollars 3.704bn. In lira
terms, the fall was 1.8 per cent.
The French market, Europe's largest and the world's third biggest after the
US and Japan, continued to rise. Sales were up from Dollars 4.846bn to
Dollars 5.181bn, an increase of 6.5 per cent in local currency. Modest
health care reforms are in the process of being implemented and a more
comprehensive package is expected next year.
The growth of the UK market continued, up 11.6 per cent in local currency
terms, although in dollar terms it fell from Dollars 2.162bn to Dollars
2.045bn. A package is expected to be introduced to control the increase in
the UK's national health service drugs bill.
Spanish sales continued to grow fast, up 13.6 per cent excluding exchange
rate factors, but down in dollar terms from Dollars 2.017bn to Dollars
1.996bn.
The largest therapeutic category remained cardiovascular medicines, although
this market fell by 3.1 per cent from Dollars 4.609bn to Dollars 4.201bn.
Doctors in Germany are understood to have been prescribing cheaper heart
drugs.
Sales of alimentary and metabolism treatments, which include anti-ulcer
drugs, increased 0.1 per cent excluding exchange rates, although in dollar
terms they declined from Dollars 3.497bn to Dollars 3.262bn.
In local currency terms, sales of central nervous system medicines were up
3.9 per cent, antibiotics and anti-virals rose 8.8 per cent.
The EC formally agreed yesterday to set up an agency to manage a new scheme
for authorising medicines in the EC single market. The European Agency for
the Evaluation of Medicinal Products is set to begin work on January 1 1995,
but only if EC leaders have agreed on a headquarters site. Contenders
include the UK, Denmark, Ireland and the Netherlands.
