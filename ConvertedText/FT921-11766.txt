FT  30 JAN 92 / International Company News: Savings movement in Norway
criticises banks

NORWAY'S Savings Banks' Association yesterday sharply criticised the
country's top three commercial banks, alleging that they adjusted credit
losses upwards to qualify for increases in state support.
The association also said the banks were under-pricing loans to
municipalities in order to boost market share.
Last year state-backed support to the country's ailing banking system
reached NKr16bn (Dollars 2.54bn).
Christiania Bank, the second biggest bank, and Fokus Bank, the third
biggest, were taken over by the state and de-listed from the Oslo bourse,
while Den norske Bank, the biggest commercial bank, received a massive state
bail-out to secure its survival.
Mr Einar Forsbakk, managing director of the Savings Banks' Association,
accused the commercial banks of bidding so low for loans that it is
virtually impossible to earn money on them. He claimed that the three
biggest commercial banks held so small interest rate margins on loans to
municipalities that they must be characterised as under-pricing.
'We have seen several examples of under-pricing (on loans) to municipalities
where the loans will contribute to a negative result,' he charged.
