FT  30 JAN 92 / Russia to step up supplies of gas to Poland

RUSSIA has agreed to increase natural gas deliveries to Poland from Monday
following a sharp drop in supplies which caused heavy industry to cut output
severely.
After meetings in Moscow with Polish officials, the Russians confirmed that
5m tonnes of oil would be delivered this year. Gas deliveries would reach
6.6bn cubic metres, but the Poles want to match last year's deliveries of
7.1bn cu m.
The break in supplies occurred after a decree by President Boris Yeltsin
invalidated a Dollars 2.8bn barter agreement signed on December 24 between
the two nations.
