FT  17 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Unforeseen costs leave Microgen lower


UNEXPECTEDLY high costs in its UK business hit profits at Microgen, the
information services company, which yesterday revealed a 14 per cent decline
to Pounds 7.3m in its pre-tax return for the year to October 31. Turnover
was Pounds 47.7m, against Pounds 47.1m.
Mr Douglas Lee, chairman, said: 'Costs and capital expenditure had been
allowed to run ahead of income during the recession.' Microgen has also been
unable to dispose of some unoccupied UK premises, which is costing the group
Pounds 525,000.
Mr Lee said the group was making good progress in cutting costs.
In Scandinavia, which he said had been hit even harder by recession than the
UK, the Capella subsidiary had won the group's largest-ever contract. The
deal with a leading Finnish bank was expected to produce revenue of about
Pounds 3m a year.
During the year, Microgen sold its office equipment and supplies business in
Sweden for Pounds 1.4m, allowing the group to concentrate on its core
businesses there, Mr Lee said.
Earnings per share, before an extraordinary gain of Pounds 189,000, fell to
12.2p (13.5p). The final proposed dividend is maintained at 4.8p, making an
unchanged total of 7p.
