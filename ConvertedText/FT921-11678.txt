FT  30 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Plan to bypass unions dropped


   By DAVID GOODHART


BRITISH RAIL has withdrawn plans to bypass unions in the new bargaining
structure it is discussing with the rail unions, David Goodhart writes.
It has, however, won provisional agreement that a number of individual
grievances traditionally covered by collective bargaining, such as regrading
claims, should be dealt with by BR management and the individual concerned.
BR proposed early last month that a large number of industrial relations
issues should no longer be discussed at the Railway Staff's National Council
but at the 30-plus profit centres and five BR businesses.
The unions say they are not in principle opposed to a devolution of
bargaining.
There is concern, however, about the provision which makes it impossible to
refer matters up from a profit centre to business or national level.
Mr Richard Rosser, general secretary of the TSSA white-collar rail union,
wrote in the last edition of his union's journal that BR's commitment to
industry-wide bargaining was restricted to general pay awards and one or two
general conditions of employment.
