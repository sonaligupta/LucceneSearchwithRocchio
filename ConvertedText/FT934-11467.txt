FT  01 NOV 93 / Four-day week 'no answer to jobs crisis'


   By QUENTIN PEEL


   BONN


Business leaders in Germany warned at the weekend that introducing a
four-day week in crisis-hit sectors of industry, as proposed by managers at
Volkswagen, could prove counter-productive, writes Quentin Peel in Bonn.
Trade union leaders are divided over the plan. There have been calls for
similar drastic action in the aerospace and coal mining industries to avert
threatened mass redundancies. Yet the unions insist that workers cannot be
expected to suffer a 20 per cent cut in their wages.
Volkswagen begins formal negotiations this week on the option between a
four-day week for its 108,000-strong workforce, or a loss of 30,000 jobs.
In a weekend interview, Mr Hans-Peter Stihl, president of the German
chambers of industry and commerce (DIHT), said the four-day week was
'fundamentally a step in the wrong direction'. 'In the future we must work
more, not less, if we want to remain competitive,' he told the popular Bild
am Sonntag newspaper. The four-day week only made sense if it was part-time
working, with a corresponding cut in wages.
Mr Tyll Necker, president of the German industry federation (BDI), said that
German industry needed cuts in real wages, not in working hours.
Mr Klaus Murmann, chairman of the German employers' federation (BDA), warned
last week that a four-day week was no panacea. 'The necessary job reduction
caused by the twin burden of recession and structural crisis may be slowed
down, but it cannot be stopped.'
The four-day week might temporarily relieve the pressure for job cuts, he
said, but it provided no substantial contribution to overcoming German
industry's cost crisis. What was needed was more flexibility in working
time.
However union leaders have rejected 20 per cent wage cuts, - including the
VW proposal.
