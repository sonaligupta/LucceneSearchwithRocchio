FT  01 JUL 92 / International Company News: Kimberly-Clark in joint venture


   By ALAN FRIEDMAN


   NEW YORK


KIMBERLY-CLARK, the US consumer products company best known for Kleenex
tissues, is forming a joint consumer products group in Europe with
VP-Schickedanz of Germany.
Terms of the 50-50 venture were not disclosed, but the combined company is
expected to have annual sales in excess of Dollars 1.2bn and a workforce in
Europe of more than 5,000.
The companies said they aimed to become a leader in the European consumer
products market. About two thirds of the estimated sales of the new venture
are expected to come from the German company's existing operation.
Kimberly-Clark said it would contribute all its consumer products operations
in continental Europe to the venture. It said it would exclude these
businesses in the UK and Ireland and its European speciality products and
service and industrial businesses.
Mr Wayne Saunders, chairman of Kimberly-Clark, and Mr Peter Fischer,
president of VP-Schickedanz, said in a joint statement that the new
partnership would take advantage of 'complementary marketing, manufacturing
and technological strengths'.
Mr Saunders said benefits for Kimberly-Clark included greater access to
German-speaking markets and strengthened positions in Spain and Italy where
the company presently does business by way of licence agreements.
Mr Fischer said that the new company would offer VP-Schickedanz an increased
presence in the French and Benelux markets.
Kimberly-Clark, with 1991 sales of Dollars 6.8bn and a workforce of 41,000
people, employs 1,200 in its continental European consumer products
businesses.
