FT  24 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Ex-BAT director to take chair at Cannon
Street


   By ROLAND RUDD


CANNON Street Investments, the industrial holding company undergoing a
financial reorganisation, is to appoint a new chairman as it prepares for
further disposals to bring down borrowings.
The company is expected to announce on Thursday, when it publishes its
results, that Mr Tom Long, a former director of BAT Industries, is to become
chairman.
He will replace Mr John Maclean, who briefly took over the chair in December
following the resignation of Mr William Hislop.
Mr Hislop turned Cannon Street round in the 1970s, but allowed the group's
borrowings to get out of hand in the 1980s. By 1991 gearing was more than
400 per cent.
Mr Long's appointment follows pressure from institutional investors who had
wanted to see an independent non-executive chairman. He helped BAT to repel
Sir James Goldsmith's unbundling attempts in 1989 and is also a former
chairman of Foseco, now part of Burmah Castrol.
Cannon Street has recently made three disposals, worth Pounds 50m,
strengthened the management team, under the new chief executive Mr Robin
Binks, and cut operating costs.
While gearing has fallen to less than 80 per cent, the group is looking at
further divestments. Top of the list is the Craigendarrock group of Scottish
hotels and leisure activities, expected to fetch about Pounds 30m although
they were bought for Pounds 40m.
The mini-conglomerate recently announced the flotation of its Avonside
building arm.
