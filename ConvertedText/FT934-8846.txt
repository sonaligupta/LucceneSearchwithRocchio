FT  13 NOV 93 / Hunger to worsen in Africa, says FAO


   By JOHN MADELEY


WORLD agricultural production will increase more slowly in the next 20 years
but will continue to outpace population growth, the United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organisation says in a study released today.
Output is expected to rise by 1.8 per cent a year compared with 2.3 per cent
a year in the last two decades. Population growth is likely to slow from 1.9
per cent now to 1.4 per cent a year.
The study, Agriculture: towards 2010, predicts that by that year food
available to people in Asia, the Near East, North Africa, Latin America and
the Caribbean will increase from 2,500 calories a head a day today 'to at or
above the 3000 calorie mark'. This is only marginally below calorie levels
in industrialised countries.
South Asia is also expected to make progress, with the percentage of
chronically undernourished people halving to about 12 per cent.
But little progress can be expected in sub-Saharan Africa, warns the study.
By 2010, Africa may have 300m undernourished people, 32 per cent of the
population, against 180m today.
'The scourge of chronic under-nutrition, in terms of absolute numbers
affected, will tend to shift from south Asia to sub-Saharan Africa,' it
says.
Worldwide, about 650m people are likely to be undernourished in 2010, the
report predicts, against 800m today.
It recommends that industrialised countries should transfer their
agricultural technologies and management practices to developing countries
in ways 'that do not discourage mixed cropping, small farmer practices, and
ways that do not lead to the dominance of mineral fertiliser and
pesticides.'
Cultivated land in developing countries is expected to grow from 705m
hectares today to 850m hectares by 2010, and this could increase pressure on
tropical forests.
