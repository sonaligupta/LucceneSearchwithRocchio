FT  22 DEC 92 / Vocational awards body to be sold off


   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff


THE GOVERNMENT is drawing up plans to transfer the Business and Technology
Education Council, the largest provider of vocational qualifications, to the
private sector.
Btec, which is a charity and a company limited by guarantee, operates in
England, Wales and Northern Ireland and was set up by the Department of
Education. Its chairman and most members are appointed by the education
secretary.
The body has often been critical of government policy on training and
particularly of the National Council for Vocational Qualifications, the
quango responsible for promoting new qualifications.
Btec, which is one of the three main vocational awarding bodies, receives no
government grant and is funded by fees for the award of qualifications. Its
status will be changed next year after recommendations from Btec itself as
to how it can best preserve its integrity.
The government said it would look to Btec's council to address 'how to
secure future arrangements best suited to enabling Btec to continue to offer
high-quality vocational qualifications and to respond effectively to the
needs of students and their parents, employers, higher education, teachers
and other interests.'
Mr John Spillers, Btec's chief executive, said: 'We will have to suggest how
we can replace the secretary of state's guarantee with a plausible system of
governance.' He hoped Btec would remain a charity that invested its
surpluses in its activities rather than become 'a money spinner for
distribution to shareholders'.
