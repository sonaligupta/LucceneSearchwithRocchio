FT  29 APR 94 / US SEC offers to advise Beijing securities regulators


   By PATRICK HARVERSON


   NEW YORK


The US Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday offered to advise
securities regulators in Beijing on developing Chinese financial markets,
when SEC chairman Arthur Levitt, signed a memorandum of understanding at the
China Securities Regulatory Commission, writes Patrick Harverson in New
York. The memorandum establishes a framework to provide technical assistance
to the CSRC, and allows for information sharing and co-operative enforcement
of US and Chinese securities laws.
Mr Liu Hongru, chairman of the CSRC, said the signing of the memorandum
would boost US investors' confidence in Chinese companies selling their
securities in US capital markets.
The accord would lead to improved protection for Chinese and US investors,
Mr Levitt said.
