FT  23 NOV 92 / S Korean president apologises


   By JOHN BURTON


   SEOUL


Mr Roh Tae-woo, the South Korean president, apologised at the weekend for
trying to stop his brother-in-law from leaving the country's ruling party,
writes John Burton in Seoul. Mr Kim Bok-dong was briefly detained by the
police last week shortly before he was scheduled to announce his defection
to the opposition United People's party (UPP).
The incident caused political controversy because it appeared to violate Mr
Roh's pledge to remain neutral in next month's presidential election.
