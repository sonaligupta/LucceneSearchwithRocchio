FT  22 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Single mother 'refugees' welcome in
Brussels


   From Ms EILEEN ADAMS


Sir, With reference to the article, 'How to recognise the British ex-pat -
executives who choose to live overseas' (Management, October 14), I note
that the category of 'political refugee' was overlooked. This includes that
dreaded breed known as single mothers obliged to live outside their country.
That much maligned little city of Brussels accepts such ex-pats, allowing
single parents to work and care for their offspring with the aid of
state-run creches and nursery schools of very good quality, open at
convenient hours (07.30 to 18.30) and contributed to in accordance with
their salary.
In turn, such refugees are fully contributing members of society and very
happy to be part of a community which actually likes women and children,
unlike life under a certain British government whose record on childcare
leaves much to be desired.
