FT  29 APR 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (15): 'I ignore the
doctor's prescription' - Equities / Building a portfolio / Having seen the
portfolio rise by 7 per cent in the past quarter, its compiler pauses to
consider the risky investment climate in which everyone has a hot tip


   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON


'There is nothing I really feel like buying for the portfolio at present.
Stop-loss limits are in place to protect some of the portfolio's profits in
the face of any further downturns in the market. (End of article. Suggest
the rest of the space is filled with photos of attractive men and women in
Speedo swimwear - a company owned by Pentland.)'
Would such an article find favour? It is at times like these that I
sympathise with professional share tipsters, who have to find something new
to recommend to their readers every week, and with fund managers who are
required to find suitable investments for the many millions of pounds that
are sent to their offices every month.
Why am I finding it so difficult just to write about a portfolio that
appears only in a quarterly review? After all, almost everyone you know
currently has a hot tip - something they know will perform better than
leaving cash on deposit.
To me, this is one of the problems. I am reminded of Peter Lynch's 'Cocktail
Theory'. Lynch was the famous manager of the Fidelity Magellan Fund, and in
his excellent book, One up on Wall Street, he explained the various stages
of market progress - from the first stage, when he attended cocktail parties
and people were not interested in talking about shares, to the fourth stage
when everyone would crowd around the fund manager and tell him what to buy.
'Even the dentist has three or four tips.'
When the fund manager reads in the newspaper that the tipped shares have all
gone up, and his neighbours are also telling him what to buy (and he wishes
he had taken their advice) then, according to Lynch, 'it's a sure sign that
the market has reached a top and is due for a tumble.'
In the last issue of the Review (January 28/29), I wrote: 'I feel the market
could be due for at least a minor shake-out in the not too distant future.'
Since then, I have experienced the cocktail theory in practice. A friend
phoned me to tell me excitedly about two companies whose shares he was going
to buy. The shares had been recommended to him by a doctor friend of his who
had heard about them from a friend. . .
Many people now seem to be so desperate to get a 'real return' on their
money that they would invest in almost anything. Twelve months ago, if a
share was tipped in a newspaper or magazine, it might well remain unmoved.
But more recently, a tip can move the share price considerably.
This has a number of dangers. The rise may be 'overdone' and the shares
reach an unsustainable level over the longer term. Shares that people rush
into, they might well also rush out of if sentiment switches towards some
other investment. It is also all too easy to create self-fulfilling
prophecies: if every share tipped automatically goes up (just because it was
tipped) then how do you really judge the underlying quality of a portfolio?
My portfolio is, I hope, founded on underlying value in the companies
concerned. After the portfolio's 'acquisition' of Alvis shares in January,
the shares were tipped in another publication, and the share price rose in
the interval between my writing the article and its publication.
They have, however, since risen still further, on the publication of Alvis's
annual report for the year ending September 30, 1993, which revealed cash
balances of Pounds 13.5m and stated that the group's investment in Avimo
Singapore stood, at that time, at approximately Pounds 45m. After
exceptional costs and interest receipts, the pre-tax profit of Alvis showed
an increase from 1992's Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 5.1m. However, I would set a
stop-loss limit (the price at which the shares would be sold) of 50-52p.
In the last Review I set a stop-loss level of 80-85p for Pentland. The
shares fell to 85p, and I considered selling them, especially as the company
has proved a disappointment to the portfolio so far. However, Pentland's
annual report, published in March, showed net cash at the December 31
year-end of Pounds 185m, despite spending on a number of acquisitions, and
paying a special dividend to shareholders of 12p per share in April 1993.
The company is 'optimistic about the prospects' for its operating profits in
1994. So, at present, I would rate it a hold, but set a revised stop-loss of
70-75p.
I remain reasonably hopeful for the longer-term future of the portfolio's
other holdings - Allied Colloids (speciality chemicals), EIS (engineering)
and William Ransom (extraction of plant materials for pharmaceutical and
other uses) - and would retain their stop-loss levels of 205-210p, 365-370p
and 45-47p respectively.
It is too early to judge the performance of the Pointon York BRI Director
Dealings Unit Trust, as the portfolio only 'invested' in it in January. The
trust closely monitors share transactions by directors in their own
companies, and uses this for its own investment decisions.
As for my other suggestions for the portfolio, none of them has fallen to my
ideal buying levels. In the January issue of the Review, I mentioned that I
hoped a general market downturn would make it possible to acquire shares in
Meggitt (an engineering company) for 80p, Renishaw (a manufacturer of
precision metrology and inspection equipment) for 220-230p and OIS
International Inspection (technical inspection services) for 60-65p.
Sadly for the portfolio, none of the shares has fallen to those levels.
Therefore the portfolio's ideal buying price for Meggitt will now be raised
to 85p.
The trouble with markets today is: who can tell what will next move a share
price? I remain concerned that actions on Wall Street will again affect
shares in the UK. But, even more, I am worried about how the UK political
situation will affect share prices.
There are various local council elections on May 5, and six parliamentary
by-elections pending. Elections for the European Parliament take place on
June 9. The Euro MP for the constituency in which I live is an extremely
able and energetic fellow, and I would have thought that his personal vote
was considerable. Yet even he has expressed concern at the possible outcome
of the elections.
This makes me even more unsure as to the short-term political future of the
UK. Stockmarkets do not like uncertainty, especially when the prime
minister's own future is continually being questioned.
So, having all these worries, and having again set stop-loss levels for the
shares in the portfolio, is there not even one more company that I might
name as a possible addition to the portfolio?
I am quite attracted to Taylor Nelson AGB, the market research company. But
the shares were suggested by my friend's doctor's friend. . . So my decision
as to whether or not to use all the cash in the portfolio to buy the shares
will depend on how far the market falls (if at all) in the next few weeks,
and whether or not continuing political uncertainties produce better buying
opportunities. Maybe more market research would be appropriate.
The author of this feature, which first appeared in the autumn 1991 issue of
the Review, is familiar to many readers as the writer of the Diary of a
Private Investor column in the Weekend FT. The Review invited him to suggest
a Pounds 10,000 portfolio for capital growth, without being too speculative.
The opinions expressed are his own. He states that his personal pension fund
has a small holding in Alvis, William Ransom, OIS International and
Pentland.
