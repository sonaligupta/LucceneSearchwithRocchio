FT  30 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Seeboard increases dividend by 15.9% -
Several hundred jobs to go in cost-saving exercise


   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor


SEEBOARD took the electricity sector's dividend increases to a new high
yesterday by announcing a 15.9 per cent rise in its total pay-out, narrowly
capping Northern Electric's 15.6 per cent rise announced on Monday.
Seeboard will also be favouring shareholders by advancing the payment date
for the final dividend by six weeks to August 23.
The final is 14.3p, bringing the total for the year to March 31 to 20p.
At the same time, however, the company announced that several hundred jobs
would be lost in a cost-saving exercise.
Sir Keith Stuart, chairman, said: 'Seeboard delivered a strong performance
in 1992-93 with increased profits, substantial progress in improving
efficiency and positive action to reduce the cost of electricity for our
customers.'
Electricity prices for households and small businesses will be reduced by
3.3 per cent in September.
The Hove-based company announced a 14.5 per cent increase in pre-tax profit
from Pounds 98.4m to Pounds 112.7m. Earnings per share rose 15.9 per cent
from 53.5p to 62p.
The greatest part of the increase came from the supply business, where
operating profit rose from Pounds 4.3m to Pounds 13.3m.
By contrast, the distribution business, which accounts for the bulk of
earnings, was virtually unchanged at Pounds 91.9m. Units of electricity sold
fell by 1.5 per cent, reflecting the recession.
Other activities, which include the retailing business, made an overall
surplus of Pounds 1.5m, up from Pounds 300,000. Southern Gas, the company's
one-year-old gas trading venture, made a trading profit of Pounds 700,000,
and now has 700 customers at 3,000 sites.
Mr Jim Ellis, chief executive, said that the company was being restructured
to create self-contained businesses and a smaller corporate head office at a
new location in Crawley. This would reduce jobs by 500-600, on top of the
500 which the company has already shed since privatisation.
'There is a major cultural change going through the company to put the focus
on profits, results and shareholder value,' he said.
COMMENT
Although the generous dividend helped boost the share price by 10p to 520p,
the market was just as pleased by Seeboard's aggressive attitude towards
costs. Its aim of being the industry's most efficient member puts it in a
good position to deal with whatever comes out of Offer's pricing reviews.
Management also took a conservative line on diversification yesterday,
promising not to be tempted by its low gearing to undertake exotic ventures.
At last night's close, the shares yielded just under 5 per cent, the lowest
in the sector, confirming Seeboard's place as the market's favourite REC,
but analysts warned that the early dividend payment could cause some
disruptions.
