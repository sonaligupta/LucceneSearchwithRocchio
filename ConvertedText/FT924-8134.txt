FT  12 NOV 92 / Shots fired at Kenyan politician


   By JULIAN OZANNE

UNIDENTIFIED youths yesterday stoned and fired shots at Mr John Keen, one of
Kenya's leading opposition politicians, as he toured the constituency he
intended to fight in next month's multi-party elections.
The attack on Mr Keen, secretary-general of the Democratic Party and one of
the key agitators for political pluralism in Kenya, marks a dramatic
increase in pre-electoral violence across the country and is bound to
exacerbate tension further.
A police spokesman said yesterday five people had been shot dead and six
injured on Tuesday at a demonstration in Meru District, eastern Kenya,
against a member of the ruling Kanu party.
The assault on Mr Keen, who received minor injuries, occurred 24 hours after
Mr Keen had declared that he wanted to contest the Kaijiado North
constituency, held by Prof George Saitoti, vice-president and minister of
finance. At a press conference on Tuesday Mr Keen said he was deeply
critical of both Prof Saitoti He and President Daniel arap Moi.
Since President Moi announced the December 7 date for the elections last
week, Kenya has suffered increasing violence and chaos. In addition,
allegations of ballot-rigging and manipulation have been levelled within all
political parties during the nomination of parliamentary candidates - which
has seen some former Kanu members defeated.
The opposition has also said that the government is preparing to steal the
elections by manipulation of the National Electoral Commission. On Tuesday,
Ambassador Smith Hempstone, US envoy to Kenya, said the government was not
playing fair and urged it to stop restricting opposition political activity.
'Many donors will not accept the legitimacy of an election which is seen to
be flawed,' he said.
