FT  24 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Gatt talks to resume in Geneva on Thursday


   By FRANCES WILLIAMS


   GENEVA


SENIOR trade negotiators will meet on Thursday in Geneva to relaunch the
108-nation Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks, with the intention
of reaching agreement on outstanding policy issues by the end of the year,
writes Frances Williams in Geneva.
The meeting of the Trade Negotiations Committee (TNC) follows last week's
settlement by the US and the European Community of the farm trade squabbles
that held up progress in the multilateral talks for nearly a year.
Mr Arthur Dunkel, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (Gatt) and TNC chairman, said countries now had the opportunity to
negotiate 'a package of results acceptable, and of benefit, to all the
participants in the round'.
He cautioned that 'hard work and further determination at the political
level' were required. However, he added that 'nobody should be in any doubt'
that it could be done.
