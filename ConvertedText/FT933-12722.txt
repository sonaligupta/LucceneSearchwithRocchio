FT  22 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets: Brazil slips 4% after defeat of wages
bill


   By JOHN PITT


Many of the world's emerging markets suffered modest downward corrections
last week, with Brazil slipping some 4 per cent in dollar terms.
Brazil's fall, as measured by data provided by the IFC, a member of the
World Bank, followed the government's defeat on a wages bill which had aimed
to limit monthly wage increases. Subsequently, President Itamar Franco
vetoed the bill, and this week the market has again rallied.
Mexico, one of the world's laggards in performance terms so far this year,
has attracted the attention of First Boston's equity strategists. They have
recently recommended an overweight position in Mexico over the next quarter,
based on factors which include 'positive economic news, attractive
valuations and the imminent signing of the Nafta side agreements'.
The Indonesian market has shown a strong performance in dollar terms since
January. While it is one of the world's more illiquid markets, a point noted
by Baring Securities in a recent country review, the market has rallied by
30 per cent in the first half of 1993.
Baring comments that the rally has been led by forecasts of a projected
earnings recovery in 1994 and a reduction in interest rates. Daily turnover
has also recovered substantially, the broker comments, from Dollars 13m in
April to above Dollars 31m at the start of June.
A consolidation is forecast in the third quarter, with activity picking up
by the year-end on expectations of improved 1994 earnings, Baring concludes.
