FT  05 NOV 93 / Early policy role urged for monetary institute: Belgium
proposes agenda for new body


   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor


The planned European Monetary Institute could start actively co-ordinating
the monetary policies of Community member states with low inflation after it
begins operations in January, Mr Philippe Maystadt, the Belgian finance
minister, suggested yesterday.
At a seminar on economic and monetary union organised by the Federal Trust
for Education and Research and Salomon Brothers International, Mr Maystadt
floated the idea of low-inflation EC countries agreeing a common monetary
growth target. The EMI could then use this to organise monetary
co-ordination and monitor progress towards the achievement of durable price
stability in the Community.
The minister, who is current president of the European Community council of
economics and finance ministers, also suggested the EMI might take over
announcing policy decisions such as interest rate changes of member central
banks agreeing to a common monetary target during the second stage of Emu
which begins in January.
The EMI, which will be based in Frankfurt and is seen as a forerunner of a
European central bank, has so far been given only vague guidance on the
scope of its operations and Mr Maystadt's remarks yesterday represented an
attempt to set an agenda for the institute.
In view of the 'rather long' second stage for Emu, it was important to
launch a qualitative step towards further European integration and to ensure
that the EMI is not perceived as an empty shell, he said. Mr May-stadt said
that national central banks would continue to make independent monetary
policy decisions. But he admitted his idea of an EC monetary target would
push the bankers and the EMI towards the 'ultimate goal of conducting a
single monetary policy at Community level'.
Not surprisingly, his approach gained no UK support. Mr Christopher Taylor,
the Bank of England's chief European adviser, said the EMI's role should be
advisory and consultative.
Mr Maystadt warned the EC against trying to operate the European exchange
rate mechanism with widened 15 per cent fluctuation margins until full
monetary union. The approach of Emu could trigger competitive currency
depreciation and threaten the EC single market, he said.
