FT  09 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Toronto recommends automated
trading


   By BERNARD SIMON and REUTER


   TORONTO


THE TORONTO Stock Exchange has recommended, after several years of
hesitation, that all equity trading on North America's busiest bourse after
New York be automated within the next 12 months.
The board of governors' recommendation is likely to be approved at a meeting
of members on February 13.
Mr Michael Edwards, the Toronto Stock Exchange chairman, said that an
electronic trading system would 'substantially increase productivity for
member-firms, reduce potential for misunderstanding and error, and
significantly reduce the cost of trading.'
However, the strong feelings aroused by the decision were quickly apparent
when one of the exchange's 240 traders loudly heckled an official who
announced the plans on the exchange's floor.
Floor traders, supported by several powerful firms, have over the years
resisted efforts to move trading to the exchange's Computer-Assisted Trading
System (Cats).
Cats is used for about half the 1,138 companies listed on the Toronto Stock
Exchange, but it accounts for only 20 to 25 per cent of trading volumes.
The decision will end equities trading on the 30,000 sq ft floor in the
heart of Toronto's financial district to which the stock exchange moved
eight years ago.
Face-to-face trading will continue, however, for options and futures at a
location which has yet to be decided.
The Toronto Stock Exchange traded 5.8bn shares valued at CDollars 67.7bn
last year, accounting for about three-quarters by value of trading on
Canada's five stock exchanges.
The credit quality of Canadian companies is expected to crumble further in
1992 as downgrades continue to outpace upgrades, but the pace of downgrades
may be slowing, analysts at rating agencies said, Reuter reports.
Sectors most at risk include retailers, steelmakers and natural resource
companies.
