FT  26 MAY 93 / Letter: Point missed on role of Tecs


   From Mr MAX WILSON


Sir, Mr Ansel (Letters, May 19) fails to appreciate the vital role that
Training and Enterprise Councils are performing and the level of commitment
of their directors and staff. Tecs organise training for the many young
people who do not wish to continue in full-time education, but who need
job-related vocational training, leading to a national qualification. In
Hampshire at any one time we support the training of some 6,500 young
people.
Through their private-sector directors, Tecs have a unique insight into the
needs of employers. At the same time, they have detailed knowledge of the
labour market. Drawing on this insight and knowledge, Tecs are well placed
to ensure that the training provided is in line with both the needs and
aspirations of the individual and the requirements of the labour market.
The work of Tecs in organising job-specific development of young people
complements that of further-education colleges. Tecs have productive
relations with the further-education sector, providing strong links with
employers and support in widening the application of National Vocational
Qualifications.
