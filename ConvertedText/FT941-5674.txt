FT  05 MAR 94 / PM denies unions a voice on Bank's governing body


   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent


Mr John Major has refused to appoint a trade union leader as a non-executive
director of the Bank of England, breaking a tradition dating from the Bank's
nationalisation in 1946.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said last night the prime minister appointed
Bank directors on the basis of their 'individual expertise' and not to
'represent other institutions'.
However, the Trades Union Congress said: 'The prime minister's decision
means the Bank of England will now lack a voice representing ordinary
working people and this will damage its credibility.'
The matter will be raised in the Commons on Monday by Mr Alistair Darling,
Labour's spokesman on the City of London. 'It is deeply regrettable that the
government has abandoned the bipartisan approach to the Bank's governing
body,' he said.
Over the past few weeks, Mr Eddie George, the central bank's governor, and
his deputy, Mr Rupert Pennant-Rea, tried hard to persuade the prime minister
to reappoint Mr Gavin Laird, general secretary of the AEEU engineering
union, for a further four-year term as a non-executive director.
Mr Laird's work as a director had impressed Mr George and his colleagues. He
was appointed to the Bank's governing body in 1986 by Lady Thatcher, the
prime minister of the day, with the support of Mr Nigel Lawson, then
chancellor. He was given a second four-year term in 1990.
Mr Major's office told the Bank that reappointing Mr Laird for a third term
would set a bad precedent. The prime minister considered another union
leader as a replacement but did not appoint him. However, Sir David Scholey,
chairman of SG Warburg, was appointed for a further four years although he
has been a Bank director since 1981.
Mr Laird and the industrialist Sir Adrian Cadbury, the other outgoing
director, will be replaced by Sir David Cooksey, chairman of the Audit
Commission and Advent, a venture capital company, and Ms Sheila Masters, a
partner in chartered accountant KPMG Peat Marwick and a member of the
chancellor's working group on private sector finance.
The TUC never directly nominated union officials to the Bank, but it was an
unwritten tradition that a union figure would serve as a director. What
particularly irritates the unions is that Mr Major's decision came the week
that the TUC 'relaunched' itself with the aim of broadening its appeal
across the party political spectrum.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, spoke to the TUC's
public services conference on Thursday, the first time in many years that a
Conservative minister had addressed a TUC conference. Mr David Hunt,
employment secretary, has agreed to speak at a TUC employment conference in
July.
But Mr Major's government has snubbed the unions before, most notably in
1992 when it decided to abolish the National Economic Development Council.
