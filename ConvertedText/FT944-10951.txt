FT  08 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading


   By JEFFREY BROWN


Stock index futures tumbled steeply in weak trading volume, sliding to a
discount to the cash market as heavy selling built in the final hour of the
session, writes Jeffrey Brown.
The FT-SE 100 December contract was 3,062 at the official 4.10pm close, a
decline of 55 points. The discount to cash equities was 4 points, with fair
value premium just under 10 points.
Once again there was very little activity, and after an initial mark-down
the December contract mostly drifted lower in thin trading volume. The day's
contracts totalled 8,091, against 11,659 last Friday.
James Capel and GNI were among a number of biggish sellers towards the
close, and from 3pm onwards there was heavy downward pressure on the cash
market.
With the December contract below 3,070 a number of important chart levels
have been broken.
Some traders have begun to fear that the market's next move will be down to
the 3,000 level.
Traded options turnover was thin at 21,113 lots, but up from the 18,500
traded on Friday. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE option turnover accounted for around
a third of volume at 8,700 contracts.
Guinness was the most active individual stock option, with 2,013 lots dealt,
followed by Lonrho (1,693 contracts) and HSBC (1,033).
