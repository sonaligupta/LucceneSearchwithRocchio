FT  23 JUL 93 / International Company News: Blockbuster Entertainment
advances 56%


   By KAREN ZAGOR


BLOCKBUSTER Entertainment, the acquisitive video rental company which owns
the Cityvision chain in the UK, yesterday posted a 56 per cent rise in
second-quarter net income to Dollars 47.7m, or 23 cents a share.
A year earlier, the Florida-based company reported net income of Dollars
30m, or 17 cents. Revenues, including those from franchise-owned video
stores, climbed to Dollars 654.1m from Dollars 448.1m.
The improved earnings and sales performance was struck on the back of strong
gains in video rental sales and a better contribution from its music
business.
For the first half, Blockbuster earned Dollars 49.9m, or 43 cents on sales
of Dollars 1.26bn, compared with profits of Dollars 55.6m, or 31 cents, on
revenues of Dollars 894.4m.
Blockbuster expanded aggressively in the second quarter, acquiring a 21.3
per cent stake in Discovery Zones, which owns and franchises children's
fitness centres. It also acquired franchise rights to develop 50 Discovery
Zone FunCenters in the US and formed a joint venture to develop 10
FunCenters in the UK.
