FT  11 JAN 92 / Letter: Election day is for those who run the show


   From Mr JOHN V C BUTCHER


Sir, Observer wonders ('Thursday puzzle', January 6) why every general
election in the UK is held on a Thursday.
Surely the reason is that, should it result in a change of government, the
new prime minister can go to Buckingham Palace to kiss hands on the Friday
and select his/her senior ministers over the weekend, thus causing the least
disruption to the mandarins who, after all, are the ones who really run the
show.
Let us emulate the continentals and hold our elections on Sundays - so that
school children won't lose a day's schooling.
The mandarins do not need to worry this year - for there isn't going to be a
change of government.
