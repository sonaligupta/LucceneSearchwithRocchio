FT  02 NOV 93 / International Company News: Philips alters ownership link
with Grundig


   By RONALD VAN DE KROL


   AMSTERDAM


PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics group, is to make changes to the structure of
ownership at Grundig, the German consumer electronics company in which it
has a 31.6 per cent stake.
However, Philips stressed that the move would have no effect on its
relations with Grundig, over which it has exercised management control since
1984, nor on the level of its Grundig holding, which will remain at 31.6 per
cent. Philips fully consolidates loss-making Grundig in its annual accounts.
The Dutch company said it planned to spend a sum of less than Fl 1m (Dollars
525,000) on buying out three German and Swiss banks which own shares in
Grundig Verwaltungs GmbH. This company is the managing partner in another
company, Grundig EMV & CO KG, which acts as a corporate control and profit
transfer company for Grundig AG.
