FT  11 APR 94 / Carrier drawings contract awarded


Conmarque Engineering, set up in February in Tyne & Wear, has won a
six-figure contract to produce working drawings for the helicopter carrier
order awarded by the Ministry of Defence to VSEL, based in
Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria.
The chairman-designate of Conmarque is Mr Ken Chapman, a former managing
director of Swan Hunter, and one of the 'gang of four' who re-privatised the
shipyard in 1986. Swans went into receivership last May after it lost the
order for the helicopter carrier to rivals VSEL.
The work was placed by Clyde-based Kvaerner, VSEL's subcontractor for the
helicopter carrier's initial construction, with Isle of Man-based Sutton
Engineering, a substantial stakeholder in Conmarque, on the basis that the
work would be carried out by Conmarque.
