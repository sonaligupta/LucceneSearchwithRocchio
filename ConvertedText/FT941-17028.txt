FT  06 JAN 94 / International Company News: Tokyo's high price of prestige -
Fewer foreign companies are willing to pay


   By WAYNE APONTE


After four consecutive years of declining Japanese equity prices, Tokyo
Stock Exchange (TSE) officials are conditioned to expect the worse.
The delisting last month by three international companies hardly came as a
surprise. But the news was one more blow to the TSE's plans to make Tokyo a
truly international exchange.
Each of the three - Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI), Dial Corp., and ITT
 -said maintaining a Tokyo listing was a heavy financial burden, and
complained about a decrease in shareholders and a drop in trading volume.
They are likely to be followed by other international companies, as the cost
of a presence in Tokyo is not matched by the prestige of a listing on the
world's second-largest exchange.
TSE officials hoped that a listing would be essential for both a foreign
company's global image and for its business relations in Japan. Mr Eisuki
Nagatomo, the director of the TSE's office of listing supervision, said that
the exchange was disappointed that 'so many foreign companies' have delisted
over the past two years, and that no new companies were interested in
listing.
'Japanese investors don't have an interest in their shares because they
can't gain substantial profits,' he said.
Brokers say that Japanese private investors have received high dividend
yields from some foreign issues during the last decade, but the yen's
appreciation against western currencies has erased the capital gains, making
them less attractive investments.
The primary reason for the recent exodus from the TSE's foreign section,
however, is the plunge of the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 issues coupled
with the subsequent decline in investor interests and local shareholders.
The Nikkei-225 average, which reached an all-time high of 38,915.87 in late
1989, ended 1993 near 17,000, and market participants have little reason to
hope for a big increase in Japanese equity prices this year.
Ten foreign companies withdrew from the exchange in 1993, bringing the total
of listed companies on the foreign section of the TSE down to 110.
During 1992, high-profile companies such as General Motors, Philips
Electronics, and Avon, the US-based cosmetics and toiletry manufacturer,
delisted. Nynex, the US communications company, and Robeco, the
Netherlands-based banking and insurance company, have sought a delisting
next month.
Brokers say there are few good reasons for international companies to
maintain a presence on the exchange amid Japan's prolonged weak economy and
financial markets. Average daily trading volume on the foreign section of
the TSE peaked in 1987 with 2.75m shares; but for September 1993 it totalled
295,000 shares.
Only those companies that deem a Tokyo listing indispensable for their core
business, rather than for financing from Japanese investors, are likely to
remain.
The daily exposure that comes with a Tokyo listing does have value in Japan,
and does help build domestic business relationships. But, balanced against
the cost, international companies have not been receiving the benefits over
the past few years that they expected. The high cost of translating
documents into Japanese and issuing financial reports to the finance
ministry have only added to their economic woes.
In the case of ICI, the overall annual cost of a Tokyo listing in 1992 was
about Dollars 182,000, the company said. ICI's shareholders plunged to 39 in
1993 from 1,200 in 1988, it added.
The question facing the TSE this year is how many more companies will find
this cost too much to bear.
