FT  21 APR 94 / EC set to back Cardiff barrage


   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent


The European Commission is believed to be close to lifting its objections to
the Cardiff Bay barrage after assurances by the government that it will help
to offset the loss of habitat for wading birds.
The Welsh Office has not authorised work to start on the barrage after Mr
Yannis Paleokrassas, the environment commissioner, sent a strongly worded
letter in January to Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary. Mr
Paleokrassas demanded more measures to protect birdlife, especially dunlins
and redshanks.
Mr Wayne David, Labour MEP for South Wales, said yesterday the government
had proposed additional measures which he was told by 'a senior source'
within the commission were acceptable. 'A letter to the government is
imminent,' Mr David said.
Cardiff Bay Development Corporation said: 'We have heard nothing officially
yet. But we're anticipating a response very soon and it sounds like good
news.'
But the Department of the Environment said: 'It is still a matter of ongoing
discussion with the commission which we consider confidential.'
The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, which alleges that the
barrage contravenes European law on the protection of bird habitats, said it
did not expect a ruling before June.
The corporation recommended six weeks ago that the main Pounds 93m
construction contract should be awarded to a joint venture of Balfour Beatty
and Costain. The barrage, which will take four years to build, will replace
tidal mudflats with a 500-acre freshwater lake as part of the regeneration
of Cardiff's docklands.
The corporation proposes a Pounds 5.7m alternative habitat. But Mr
Paleokrassas's letter, leaked to environment group Friends of the Earth,
called for further measures.
