FT  13 APR 94 / International Company News: Sharp increase in KPN payout

Koninklijke PTT Nederland, the state-owned Dutch telecommunications and
postal group which is preparing for a bourse flotation later this year,
yesterday announced a sharp rise in its 1993 dividend, bringing its payout
level into line with other publicly-quoted telecoms operators.
KPN said its dividend to the Dutch state is to be lifted to 50 per cent of
1993 net profit, a significant increase from the rate of around 40 per cent
which it has paid to the government throughout recent years.
The company, whose partial flotation will probably take place in late May or
early June, had been widely expected to raise its payout rate after
privatisation, increasing its attraction as a yield-orientated utility stock
to investors.
KPN also reported yesterday that its 1993 net profit rose by 7.9 per cent to
Fl 1.8bn (Dollars 945m) from Fl 1.66bn in 1992, meeting the company's
forecast that results would at least match the average 5 per cent rate of
profit growth seen in recent years. Its dividend in cash will be raised to
Fl 898m, or 50 per cent of net profit, from Fl 666m the year before.
Mr Cees Griffioen, finance director, said the sharp increase in the dividend
reflected the fact that KPN had now succeeded in boosting group equity to 50
per cent of total liabilities, compared with around 30 per cent in the late
1980s. But he said the 50 per cent payout rate should be seen as 'a new
basis which we are seeking for the future'.
