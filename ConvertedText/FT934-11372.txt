FT  01 NOV 93 / Russian banks opt to invest overseas


   By LEYLA BOULTON

RUSSIAN banks have more than Dollars 15bn stashed away in accounts in the
west but have made hard currency loans worth less than half a billion
dollars to customers within Russia.
Thirteen banks, which account for 80 per cent of Russian hard currency
operations, had Dollars 10.03bn in correspondent and investment accounts in
western banks at January 1 this year, according to a western study. The same
banks had outstanding loans of less than Dollars 300m lent to customers
inside Russia.
By this June, all Russian banks held about Dollars 15.5bn abroad, according
to central bank figures. Loans within Russia were worth about 3 per cent of
that sum.
The figures compiled from official sources and the banks are an index of the
financial chaos within the Russian economy.
While the banks have large amounts of hard currency abroad, the government
is rescheduling debts owed to the west, seeking other forms of international
finance to help it promote business investment.
Many Russian companies with export potential have money but do not trust the
national currency or the authorities enough to keep it at home in roubles.
Banks avoid lending within the country - except to clients which earn hard
currency and are well-known to them - because of to a lack of mechanisms to
ensure repayment.
Mr Francis Gelibter, director of Eurosiris Russie, the St Petersburg-based
joint venture of Eurosiris, the French consultancy, which conducted the
study said: 'If I were the manager of a Russian bank I would do the same
because there are few alternatives to placing the money abroad. Lending is
risky because you don't know if the person will disappear tomorrow or
whether new legislation will ruin the success of a project.'
