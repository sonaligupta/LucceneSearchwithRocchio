FT  14 APR 94 / International Company News: Restructuring pushes Michelin
into net deficit


   By JOHN RIDDING

Depressed European markets and the costs of an ambitious restructuring
programme pushed Michelin, the world's largest manufacturer of tyres, into a
net loss of FFr3.67bn (Dollars 625m) last year, the group announced
yesterday.
The French company said, however, that recovery was under way and that it
was well positioned to return to profit this year. Industry analysts
predicted that net profits could exceed FFr1bn for 1994 as markets revive
and the benefits of the company's restructuring programme feed through.
Last year's loss, which compares with a net profit of FFr79m in 1992, was at
the upper end of industry forecasts and included a FFr2.76bn charge for the
group's two-year restructuring plan. Sales fell by 5.3 per cent to
FFr63.29bn.
Mr Eric Bourdais de Charbonniere, finance director, said that Michelin was
on course to achieve its target savings of FFr3.5bn by 1995 through a
package of job cuts and productivity measures.
The package, launched last April, had brought savings of FFr1bn in 1993 and
allowed a return to profit on ordinary activities in the final months of the
year, the company said.
Mr de Charbonniere also described a recovery in the group's principal
markets. 'In Europe, first-quarter sales to the original equipment markets
have shown a clear improvement,' he said.
Sales of replacement tyres have also improved, although this is more a
reflection of the introduction of new products than of a recovery in the
market, the company said.
In the US, according to Michelin, recovery started last year and is more
firmly established. The end of a price war launched in the spring of 1993,
confirmed by an increase in prices by the five major tyre companies in the
US market in the first quarter of this year, had further strengthened
prospects, said Mr de Charbonniere.
Net debts fell slightly, from FFr29.3bn at the end of 1992 to FFr28.7bn at
the end of last year.
