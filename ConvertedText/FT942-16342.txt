FT  11 APR 94 / Ford and Mazda plan 'global' car


   By JOHN GRIFFITHS


Ford Motor, which has just launched the North American version of its Mondeo
'world car', is considering with Mazda of Japan a more far-reaching 'global'
car project.
Ford's European engineering departments would lead the development of a
replacement for the Ford Escort range which would be built and sold by both
Ford and Mazda from early in the next century.
Ford and Mazda would use common sourcing of components, from wherever they
could be supplied most cost-effectively. The cars would have cosmetic
differences - as with the Mondeo and its North American counterpart the
Contour - but would share under-the-skin components such as engine and
gearbox.
Ford has collaborated with Mazda before on car projects, but this is the
first time that any two manufacturers have contemplated such a development
on a global scale. Its significance goes beyond economies of scale. Ford
envisages that both Mazda's and Ford's north American styling and
engineering resources could be focused more efficiently on complementary
projects.
Mazda would develop niche products, such as sports cars and multi-purpose
vehicles for both itself and Ford, while Ford's North American engineers
would use their expertise in larger cars to develop similar 'world' cars for
Ford and Mazda.
