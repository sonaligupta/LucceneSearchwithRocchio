FT  29 JAN 92 / Arts: Today's Television


   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY


There is a fair amount of sport around tonight. Not being a soccer fan, I
shan't be watching Liverpool play Arsenal in The Match (8.00 ITV) but if I
can sneak away from the television I may well listen to some of the Test
Match Special, which begins on Radio 3 at 9.25 pm and runs until 5.00
tomorrow morning, covering the opening day of England's second Test against
New Zealand, live from Auckland.
The true and horrifying story behind 'Bridge On The River Kwai' is the
subject of Timewatch (8.10 BBC2). It was not just prisoners of war who were
forced by the Japanese to work on the Burma railway, but 250,000 Asian
labourers were also conscripted, of whom 100,000 may have died. Dispatches
investigates Britain's fifth largest company, Hanson Trust (9.00 C4). The
programme promises to examine 'the role played by 40 interlocking
Panama-registered subsidiaries, not mentioned in the Hanson accounts, in
helping the company avoid tax and maximise profits'. Hanson, it says, now
has a collection of companies mostly in declining, cyclical, or low growth
businesses that are unlikely to yield the sort of profits to which Hanson
shareholders have become accustomed.
