FT  30 NOV 94 / Charities receive phone guidelines


Guidelines on telephone fundraising, including bans on calls after 9pm or to
children under 16, were issued by the Institute of Charity Fundraising
Managers yesterday.
The guidelines come as charities are increasingly turning to telephone
fundraising - 65 charities raised almost Pounds 11m last year through 1.4m
calls. Some 63 per cent of the charities used an outside agency for the
calls.
The institute's code of practice states that charities:
Should not use random digit-dialling by computer.
Should have clear contracts with agencies.
Should ensure that calls are 'pleasant and honest' and that callers accept
the ending of a conversation without argument.
Should send a letter before the call where possible, giving the option to
refuse the call.
Mr Karl Holweger, chairman of the institute's telephone working group, said
use of the phone by charity fundraisers was set to increase.
'This should be welcomed as a cost-effective and efficient way of matching
donors to causes,' he said.
But the growth had to be 'mirrored by a responsible attitude by charities
and their agents'.
