FT  26 JUN 92 / M25 plan for 14 lanes announced


   By RICHARD TOMKINS


CONTROVERSIAL plans to widen part of London's M25 orbital motorway to 14
lanes in Staines, west of London, were announced by Mr John MacGregor,
transport secretary, yesterday.
Mr MacGregor said the work, which is expected to cost Pounds 144m, was
essential to relieve congestion on the busiest section of motorway in
Britain, and would be carried out only after full consultations with those
affected.
The plans were welcomed by the Freight Transport Association as good news
for industry and the environment.
The environmental lobby reacted angrily. The Council for the Protection of
Rural England said the widening could only fuel 'a never-ending spiral of
traffic growth'.
The 126-mile M25 was completed only six years ago, but it is already
operating far beyond its design capacity because it created travel patterns
that were unforeseen by traffic forecasters. In September Mr MacGregor's
predecessor, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, announced Pounds 2.8bn for increasing the
motorway's capacity, notably by squeezing a new fourth lane in each
direction alongside the three existing ones.
The latest plan goes much further than that, parallelling the eight-lane
motorway with three-lane feeder roads in each direction between the M3 and
M4 junctions to keep local traffic off the motorway.
