FT  21 DEC 92 / International Company News: Driving force behind mergers


   By BRIAN BOLLEN


INDUSTRY restructuring remains an important driving force behind many
international mergers and acquisitions, writes Brian Bollen.
British Airways furthered its ambitions to be a truly global airline by
winning with its bid for a 25 per cent stake in Australia's Qantas.
Italian flag carrier Italia is joining in the trend for airlines to strike
alliances by taking a 30 per cent stake in Malev, Hungary's national
carrier.
In the financial services sector, Arthur Andersen, the international
accountancy firm, announced an affiliation agreement with Asahi Shinwa of
Japan, paving the way for a full merger.
Hafnia, the troubled Danish insurance company, started its planned series of
disposals with the sale of Prolific, its UK life insurance subsidiary, to
Scottish Provident.
Fisons, the UK pharmaceuticals and scientific group, continued with its
restructuring by selling its UK consumer healthcare business to Hoffman-La
Roche of Switzerland. The demand for a stake in the over-the-counter market
was reflected in the generous price paid.
Tesco's acquisition of the Catteau supermarket chain in France, giving it a
toe-hold in Europe, is being taken as an indication that the major UK
retailers will expand into Europe as their home market becomes saturated.
Tesco said Catteau represented an excellent opportunity to acquire a French
retailer in the same sector as its own core business, and that the
combination of existing management's local experience and Tesco's expertise
will further enhance Catteau's growth prospects.
The third round of bidding in the privatisation of Argentina's gas industry
saw British Gas double the size of its global gas division as the consortium
it led won the auction for Distribuidora de Gas Metropolitana, the country's
largest gas distributor.
