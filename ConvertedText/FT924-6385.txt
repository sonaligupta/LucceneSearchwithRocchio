FT  21 NOV 92 / Letter: Regulation of share options


   From Ms CAROL ARROWSMITH


Sir, The tenor of Michael Cranna and John Samuels' article on executive
share options ('Omissions on options', November 18) paints a lurid picture
of an unregulated area, populated by rapacious executives and inattentive
investors. The reality is different.
For example, equity dilution under share schemes is strictly limited by
institutional shareholders' guidelines which have been in place. Discounted
options are also already regulated by institutional guidelines which impose
demanding performance conditions on their exercise and limit the number of
discounted options an individual can receive. Finally, the practice of
replacing voluntarily lapsed options with new options is subject to detailed
regulation by shareholders, and in fact is a fairly rare occurrence.
It is certainly true that the disclosure of share option details in most
companies' annual reports is insufficient to calculate individual directors'
remuneration, and that there is room for debate on the nature of the
executive option benefit. But it is important the debate takes place in an
informed atmosphere, and focuses on the practice of the vast majority of
companies, rather than the small minority where misuse takes place.
