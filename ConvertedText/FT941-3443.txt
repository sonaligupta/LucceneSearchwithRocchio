FT  16 MAR 94 / Observer: Scandal fiasco


When does the Whitewater brouhaha turn into a scandal? The resignation of
Webster Hubbell, the US associate attorney general and US presidential
buddy, raises a question which is vexing careful newspaper editors.
Up to yesterday, Observer's electronic database showed a total of 347
references in the UK press to Bill and Hillary's Whitewater problems. There
were 178 mentions of 'scandal' and just 111 'affairs'. Poor old uproar,
fiasco, furore, blemish and slur don't warrant a mention; fuss gets just
one.
Of course statistics are no guide to anything. With the tally to date
standing at one suicide and two resignations, the verdict of one ex-member
of President Bush's administration is: 'Right now it's an affair. Four more
resignations, then it's a scandal.'
