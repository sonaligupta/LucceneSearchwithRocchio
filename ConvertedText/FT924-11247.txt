FT  27 OCT 92 / What Future For Coal?: Relative view of regeneration -
Ministers have pinned much on job creation plans for mining areas / A look
at how Consett has fared since the loss of steel


   By CHRIS TIGHE


SUNBEAMS and showers flicker over the empty plain where the steelworks used
to belch its red dust and the sparrows reputedly woke up coughing. Consett,
the former steel town in County Durham, perched on a hilltop against a
background of rolling Pennine moorland, looks almost picturesque.
Gary Race, 29 and jobless nearly two years since his one-man business
folded, is pensive. In the Jobcentre he has just spotted an advertisement
for an abattoir meat packer with an applicants' age limit of 18.
His 57-year-old father Stewart scans the 700-acre site of the former works,
Europe's biggest reclamation project of the 1980s. It is earmarked for
Project Genesis, an environmentally friendly business, housing and leisure
redevelopment that has yet to happen.
Mr Race senior, unable to find a permanent job since the steel closure in
1980, is reconciled to not working again.
The steelworks, which created and dominated Consett, employed 6,500 in 1970.
When it closed, shedding its remaining 3,700 jobs, the town became a symbol
of the previous manufacturing recession.
Derwentside, with a population of 87,000, including Consett, was not
declared an enterprise zone, but it was swiftly granted Pounds 35m
government aid for land reclamation, factory building and road improvements.
Public investment in Derwentside since 1980 has risen to Pounds 50m.
The area's regeneration programme, backed by European and UK regional policy
grants, has frequently been cited by ministers as a shining example of
economic recovery. Many people in Consett see it rather differently.
Mr John Lee, the steelworks union leader, said: 'It's not an economic
miracle, it's an impossible task.'
Mr Gary Race said talk of regeneration was 'rubbish'. After spasmodic
building-site work dried up in the 1980s he started a mobile video hire
business, backed with an Pounds 8,000 loan. Then thieves stole his van with
all his videos, which he had decided he could not afford to insure. Two
years later, the family is still paying off the loan.
Consett's dramatically improved environment has been enlisted in 'positive
image' promotion. Incoming biotechnology and aerospace companies and
Consett-made tortilla chips have reinforced the transformation message.
'Ghost town' predictions have proved wrong - loyalty and roots run deep. Yet
the loss of the steelworks jobs and culture is still mourned.
Many locals do not support the assumption that today's dust-free,
diversified Consett must be better. 'If my father had still been at the
steelworks he could've got me in,' said Mr Gary Race.
Mr Lee said: 'The community doesn't die, but there's a spirit within it
which takes a bashing.' Many residents complain that the 'new' Consett means
low pay and insecurity.
Derwentside's unemployment, at 4,413 half its 1982 high of nearly 9,000,
remains above the national average at about 15 per cent. Intensive effort in
the 1980s generated an estimated 5,000 manufacturing jobs in Derwentside,
replacing the 5,000 lost in the 1980 closures of the steelworks and a local
ball bearing plant.
But the job haemorrhage started before the steelworks closed and continued
afterwards. Derwentside's manufacturing jobs total, which fell from 12,900
in 1977 to 4,800 in 1981, had risen to only 6,200 by 1989. The 1989 district
jobs total of 20,600, although 1,800 higher than 1981, was 2,000 down on
1987 due to agricultural and service-sector decline. The 1991 figure, not
yet available, is expected to be lower. Without the job creation drive,
Consett's economy would be forlorn.
This recession has bitten, too. Last year the Derwentside Industrial
Development Agency, the private-sector-led body spearheading regeneration,
announced that 5,300 jobs had been created since 1980. That has now fallen
to 5,015. The agency said it had helped 190 companies and had just announced
Consett's first overseas inward investment since 1986.
Mr Eddie Hutchinson, chief executive of the development agency, said: 'We've
seen in Derwentside a measure of success, but industrial regeneration is a
long job. You can measure it in decades.'
