FT  27 JUN 92 / Briefcase, Q&A: Unlucky numbers


I WONDER if you could tell me the odds of winning a single prize on ERNIE
(the Premium Bond computer) with a holding of Pounds 10,000 in 10,000
consecutive numbers over a period of two years.
After the first year of no prizes, I wrote to the Bond Office to check the
numbers' validity. This was confirmed. Another year later, I have still not
won anything from this maximum holding.
According to the National Savings you have been 'quite phenomenally
unlucky'. On each monthly draw, someone with your holding has ten chances in
11 of winning at least one prize. Thus, by the law of averages, over 11
months you would expect to win ten prizes. Not to win any in 24 months, when
you might have expected to win 21, stretches the bounds of probability to
the limit.
However, ERNIE is random, according to National Savings - numbers are
computer-generated, and the fact that occasionally someone is as unlucky as
you have been only proves that ERNIE is random.
