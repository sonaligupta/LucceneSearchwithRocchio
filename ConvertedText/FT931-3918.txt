FT  13 MAR 93 / UK troops reach safety after Bosnian blockade


   By REUTER


   BANJA KOVILJACA


BRITISH troops reached safety yesterday after spending 24 hours blockaded in
a Moslem-held Bosnian village, the British army said, Reuter reports from
Banja Koviljaca.
Eleven British soldiers and World Health Organisation doctor Simon Mardel,
who is also British, arrived in the Serbian town of Banja Koviljaca, several
hours after leaving the besieged Moslem village of Konjevic Polje.
The British went to Konjevic Polje on Thursday to act as an escort for a
United Nations convoy sent to pick up people wounded in the fighting.
They had initially been prevented from leaving by crowds of women and
children who wanted to make sure that all the wounded were evacuated, not
just wounded women and children as stipulated by the Serbs.
Military spokesman Major Martin Waters said their officer had decided to
pull out because their presence was attracting shellfire which was
endangering the civilian population.
Shelling by Serbs killed and wounded a number of women and young children
who were blockading the British soldiers.
Major Waters said two doctors had performed operations on the victims
without the use of anaesthetic. 'There are quite a few dead, and six
children under five were seriously injured, two with their legs blown off.'
he said.
