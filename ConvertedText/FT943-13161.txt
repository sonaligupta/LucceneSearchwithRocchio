FT  21 JUL 94 / International Company News: Cheung Kong plans China spin off
listing

   HONG KONG


Cheung Kong, the flagship of Mr Li Ka-shing's listed Hong Kong empire, is to
spin off its China interests - which include property, hotel and
infrastructure projects - in a separate listing within the next three and a
half years.
To finance its China interests, which were recently brought together under
the umbrella of Cheung Kong Holdings (China), Cheung Kong plans to issue
USDollars 300m worth of five-year exchangeable floating-rate notes.
The notes, which will pay 50 basis points above the three-month US dollar
London interbank offered rate, may be redeemed for shares in Cheung Kong
(Holdings) China, once the initial public offer takes place, on an assured
allotment basis, or for cash.
Holders of the notes may convert them into shares within one year of the
IPO. After this, the notes become similar to a convertible note with an
initial conversion premium of 10 per cent. Investors are also being offered
a put option after three years, or on the first anniversary, enabling them
to redeem the notes for the principal amount plus accrued interest.
Cheung Kong (Holdings) China 's projects include 11 property developments,
five government-supported housing schemes and two hotels in Beijing and
Guangzhou.
