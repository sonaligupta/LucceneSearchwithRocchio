FT  27 OCT 92 / Bankers voice fears on insider dealing reforms


   By JOHN GAPPER


SENIOR bankers expressed concern yesterday that planned legislation to
prevent insider dealing and money laundering might place unreasonable
restrictions on staff in commercial banks.
The British Bankers Association said it was worried that measures in the
Criminal Justice Bill might expose senior managers with responsibilities for
different functions within commercial banks to the risk of acting in breach
of the law.
The association is concerned that when a bank is involved in restructuring a
troubled company, managers with overall responsibility for both banking and
securities may learn things that will be counted as inside information.
Lord Inchyra, association director-general, said banks were also concerned
at the potential effect of making junior staff legally responsible for
reporting unusual money transactions that might indicate money laundering.
The association feared that staff might be placed under a statutory
obligation to report cases of potential money laundering when they did not
know enough about the transactions to make an informed judgment about their
significance.
The Treasury has already attempted to deal with City concern over the bill
by re-drafting it, and issuing guidance notes on the interpretation of the
law.
Lord Inchyra said the presumption of confidentiality was 'an essential
feature' of banking. The circumstances in which it was breached should be
'tightly circumscribed'.
The association is examining the published bill and guidance notes and may
try to get amendments tabled in the House of Lords. The bill was introduced
in the Lords on Friday. It will bring the law into harmony with European
Community directives.
