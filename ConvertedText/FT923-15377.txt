FT  02 JUL 92 / Warburgs voted top research firm


   By BARRY RILEY


SG WARBURG Securities has retained the title of top stockbroking research
firm in this year's Extel Financial Survey of Investment Analysts.
James Capel, which for many years until 1990 was consistently top, has
slipped to third place, followed by UBS Phillips & Drew and Kleinwort Benson
Securities.
There are signs that the fund managers polled for the survey believe that
the quality of stockbroking research, criticised in the past, is beginning
to improve. However, half the managers surveyed still feel that the research
does not contain any creative or original ideas.
According to the survey, which covers 126 management companies handling
Pounds 560bn of investments, fund managers are making themselves more
independent of brokers' research and are more likely to be in direct contact
with the companies in which they invest, or might invest.
However, there has also been an increase in the use of so-called 'soft
commission' arrangements in which stockbroking commissions are used to pay
for services. Such 'softing' is practised by 79 per cent of the large
segregated pension fund managers.
