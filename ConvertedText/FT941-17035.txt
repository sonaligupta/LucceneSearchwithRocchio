FT  06 JAN 94 / International Company News: Cartel office warns Krupp over
unit sale


   By REUTER


   BERLIN


Germany's cartel office said the Krupp Hoesch steel group was obliged to
sell its shock absorber unit Krupp Bruenninghaus and that a change in market
conditions could not excuse the company from breaking an agreement with the
cartel office, Reuters reports from Berlin.
The cartel agency said Krupp, which as part of its 1992 acquisition of
Hoesch had agreed to sell the unit by the end of 1993, had not fulfilled
that requirement. 'In order to ensure the guarantees are fulfilled, the
cartel agency will make use of all its rights to break up this cartel,' the
agency said.
The group recently told the cartel office it could not fulfil the
requirement to sell the unit because of extremely negative economic
developments.
Krupp Hoesch shock absorber operation has annual sales of about DM900m
(Dollars 517m).
