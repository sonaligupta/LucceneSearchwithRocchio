FT  26 MAY 93 / Observer: Hanson grub


What on earth will the competition make of Lord Hanson's spirited defence of
San Lorenzo, Princess Di's favourite restaurant?
The chairman of Britain's 10th biggest company has written for a second time
to complain about the London Evening Standard's description of the output of
one of his favourite trattorias as 'canteen grub for the rich and famous'.
According to Hanson, the over-priced Italian hostelry does not need to
defend itself but its customers are 'infuriated by these needless and
ill-informed attacks'.
Even if some of Lord Hanson's corporate rivals do not regard this as another
sign that Britain's number one predator is taking his eye off the ball, the
other hostelries he frequents, such as Harry's Bar, Mark's Club and
Santinis, must be wondering what they have to do to get a ringing
endorsement from a blue chip client. A different table perhaps?
