FT  28 MAR 92 / International Company News: Axel Springer plans to cut staff
by 11%


AXEL Springer, the Berlin-based publishing group, is to reduce its workforce
by 11 per cent in a programme designed to tighten and improve management
controls and reduce costs by 16 per cent, writes Christopher Parkes in Bonn.
The group's workforce of 12,620 would be cut by 1,400 by next year through a
combination of early retirement and redundancies, the company said
yesterday, .
The company, which publishes the Bild mass-circulation paper and the
loss-making Die Welt, recently announced it would pay no dividend for 1991,
following a two-thirds drop in after-tax profits to DM20m (Dollars 12m). All
earnings were paid into reserves.
