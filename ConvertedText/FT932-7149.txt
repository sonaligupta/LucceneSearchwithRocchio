FT  25 MAY 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report


   By REUTER


GOLD fixed slightly lower than its morning setting in the afternoon on the
London bullion market, taking the steam out of the overnight run-up in
prices for all precious metals, dealers said. Technically, gold's outlook
remains positive. ZINC broke lower on the LME, ending near fresh six-year
lows. Selling pressure at around Dollars 970 a tonne for three-month metal
eventually triggered the expected sell stops, driving prices down to Dollars
957 at one stage. Fundamentals remain weak, with supply continuing to exceed
demand, and the market is in need of cuts in refined production to prevent
further losses. TIN touched fresh 17-month lows, and traders expect further
losses soon. If recent contract lows near Dollars 5,450 a tonne for
three-month metal are breached, the market could fall to Dollars 5,300 - the
lowest in real terms since the early 1970s. London robusta COFFEE ended
around the day's lows on profit taking after an earlier advance. Dealers
said moves between Latin American producers towards setting up an alliance
to harmonise polices would have little market impact unless they led to firm
agreements to withhold supplies.
