FT  12 NOV 93 / EU provides Yeltsin with pre-poll boost

THE European Union is to provide a showcase for President Boris Yeltsin of
Russia in Brussels next month on the eve of the European summit - and of his
own parliamentary elections.
Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister and holder of the EU
presidency, said last night after meeting Mr Yeltsin in Moscow that he had
invited the Russian leader to Brussels on December 9 to sign a declaration
of intent preparatory to a signing of the Treaty of Partnership between the
EU and Russia, which for technical reasons cannot be signed until the end of
December.
The European summit is on December 10 and 11, and the Russian elections are
on December 12.
Mr Alexander Shokhin, the Russian deputy premier who has, with Sir Leon
Brittan, the Brussels trade commissioner, thrashed through the agreement
which was finally approved in principle earlier this week by EC foreign
ministers, said that all matters of principle had been settled and all main
compromises made. 'It now only remains to put these principles into a
detailed language,' he said.
The Partnership Treaty should usher in a closer political and economic
dialogue between the EU and Russia.
Mr Dehaene said that Russian exports to the EU countries were eight times
more than to Japan and 27 times more than to the US, while the member
countries contribute 65 per cent of the assistance to Russia. He said that
yesterday's visit by himself and Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission
president, was the beginning of a series of meetings which would put the
dialogue between Russia and the EU on the same footing as between the EU and
the US and Japan.
Mr Willy Claes, the Belgian foreign minister, said that they had no doubt
that the elections in Russia - to which the EU would send a number of
observers - would be free and democratic, and mark a 'historic turning
point' for the Russian people.
