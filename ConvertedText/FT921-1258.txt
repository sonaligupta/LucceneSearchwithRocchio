FT  25 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Strong second half lifts Worcester


Worcester Group, the central heating specialist, lifted pre-tax profits by
27 per cent, from Pounds 3.55m to Pounds 4.52m, in 1991.
The second half produced a particularly strong performance, with profits of
Pounds 3.44m compared with Pounds 1.54m.
The result came in spite of interest charges up from Pounds 670,000 to
Pounds 900,000 and included a loss of Pounds 480,000 (Pounds 960,000
profits) in the MCL construction subsidiary. Turnover rose by 48 per cent to
Pounds 65.2m (Pounds 44m).
Sales of combi and oil-fired boilers at Worcester Heat Systems rose by 17
per cent and margins improved.
Radson, the Belgium-based subsidiary acquired in December 1990, turned round
into profit during the year, and Grate Glow Fires, acquired in April 1990,
also made a contribution.
With improved earnings per share of 10.4p (9.4p) the proposed final dividend
is stepped up to 2.88p for a total of 4.21p (4.01p).
