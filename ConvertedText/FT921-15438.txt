FT  10 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Druck shows 13% advance to Pounds 2.4m


Druck Holdings, a maker of electronic pressure measuring devices, lifted
pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.14m to Pounds 2.4m, in the six months to
September 30.
The interim dividend is raised to 3.4p (2.8p) as first half profits were
expected to provide a larger proportion of profit than previously. Earnings
were 23.3p (20.7p).
Sales were up by Pounds 3.2m to Pounds 13.5m, the strong growth resulting
from a large order book at April 1 and Maywood Instruments being
consolidated for the first time, explained Mr John Salmon, chairman.
