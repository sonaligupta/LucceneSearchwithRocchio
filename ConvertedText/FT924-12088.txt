FT  22 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Better margins for Le Creuset


Trading margins improved at Le Creuset, the French-based but London-listed
maker of cast iron cookware and tableware, in the first half of 1992 and
pre-tax profit rose by 4 per cent.
Including Screwpull for a full six months, turnover grew 15 per cent to
Pounds 17.8m. But profits had to bear redundancy charges of Pounds 316,000
following relocation, while the comparative first half benefited from the
sale of the Paris office.
Also, interest charges increased to Pounds 651,000 (Pounds 241,000) leaving
the pre-tax balance at Pounds 1.15m (Pounds 1.1m). Earnings per share worked
through at 4.6p (4.4p).
Good volume growth was achieved throughout the group. Subsidiaries in the US
and UK again improved profits, and the Japanese company also performed to
plan.
In the immediate future directors believed modest sales volume increases
were achievable. They would also be implementing price rises in almost all
the main countries of operation by 'an appropriate percentage above
inflation'.
