FT  22 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US mine clean-up 'could cost
Dollars 70bn'


   By REUTER


   WASHINGTON


CLEANING UP more than 550,000 abandoned hardrock mines in 32 US states could
cost between Dollars 32bn and Dollars 71.5bn, according to a report by the
Mineral Policy Centre, a Washington-based mining reform lobby group, reports
Reuter from Washington.
Hardrock mining is the extraction of metals such as gold, silver, copper,
iron, uranium, zinc and nonfuel minerals such asbestos, gypsum, phosphate
rock, sulphur by surface or underground mining methods. Abandoned hardrock
mine sites include underground mine openings, open pits and waste rock
piles.
The report, Burden of Gilt, calls for an establishment of a national
hardrock abandoned mines reclamation programme that would include a
nationwide inventory of sites on public and private lands.
It also urges a minimum of Dollars 400m a year to fund the programme from
fees and royalties on the mining industry.
The report was immediately attacked by the Mineral Resources Alliance, the
trade association for the mining industry, and Senator Larry Craig,
Republican, Idaho.
'They admit they don't know how many sites, therefore they don't know the
cost of clean-up,' said Senator Craig, author of the Mining Reform Act,
which has already passed in the Senate. He suggested the cost would be much
lower.
