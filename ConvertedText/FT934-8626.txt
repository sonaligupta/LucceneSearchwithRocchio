FT  15 NOV 93 / US judge lifts curb on TV networks

A LOS ANGELES judge has cleared the way for big changes in the financing of
the US television industry by lifting a long-standing ban on the three large
TV networks - ABC, CBS and NBC - owning a financial interest in most of the
programmes they broadcast.
The ruling by Judge Manuel Real, which had been awaited for more than a
year, was made known to Hollywood film industry executives late on Friday.
It will mean tough new competition from the networks for the large Hollywood
film studios, which provide most of the prime-time television programming.
It could also eventually encourage mergers between the TV networks and the
film studios.
The court ban, imposed on anti-trust grounds, was one of two obstacles
preventing the networks having a financial involvement in prime time
programmes.
The other was the so-called financial interest and syndication rule, imposed
more than 20 years ago by the Federal Communications Commission, at a time
when the three networks controlled more than 90 per cent of the television
market.
With the three networks now accounting for only 60 per cent of the market,
the FCC lifted its ban in April. With both obstacles now removed, the trio
will be allowed to acquire a financial interest in prime time programming
and, two years from now, to sell reruns in the Dollars 5bn global market for
syndicated television programmes.
Film industry officials indicated they were likely to appeal against the
ruling by Judge Real.
Ms Barbara Brogliatti, a spokeswoman for the Warner Brothers film studio and
a group of producers, writers and directors, said: 'We're disappointed. We
fear for the survival of independent producers.'
