FT  19 APR 94 / Consumer hopes 'near record low'


   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent


Consumers' confidence about their financial prospects is close to an
all-time low, says a survey released by Gallup yesterday.
The survey, conducted by Gallup for the European Commission, follows a
relatively downbeat survey on retail sales from the Confederation of British
Industry and offers further evidence that this month's tax increases may
dent consumer spending.
Gallup asked people how they thought their households' financial position
would change over the next 12 months. Of those interviewed, 45 per cent
think their position will become slightly or much worse while only 15 per
cent think things will improve. The negative balance of 30 percentage points
is the worst since March 1990.
Gallup says the figures indicate that the tax increases are having 'an acute
adverse effect on consumer confidence and give rise to concerns that
economic recovery might be stalled'.
But it adds that confidence is approaching historically low levels, and is
therefore unlikely to fall significantly further.
Consumer views of the UK's economic prospects have also deteriorated, with
43 per cent of those surveyed pessimistic compared with 21 per cent who are
optimistic. The negative balance of 22 percentage points compares with the
position in January, when the number of optimists equalled the number of
pessimists.
However, consumers have become relatively more upbeat about the prospects
for employment since March - although pessimists still outnumber optimists
by 37 percentage points.
A balance of 12 percentage points regard the present as the right time to
make a substantial purchase, the highest level recorded for three months.
Gallup interviewed 1,991 adults between March 30 and April 12.
