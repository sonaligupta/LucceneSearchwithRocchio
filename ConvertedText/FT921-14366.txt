FT  16 JAN 92 / Polish deficit battle


   By PETER BRUCE and CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI


   WARSAW


Mr Jan Olszewski, the Polish prime minister, yesterday urged parliament's
upper chamber to approve the government's first quarter budget provisions,
amid threats of a one-day protest strike by members of the former communist
trade unions, writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw.
Mr Olszewski warned that even after cuts in government spending aimed at
reducing the budget deficit target to Zl 17,600bn (Pounds 890m) the real
budget out-turn could be overwhelmed by the volume of overdue 1991 payments.
These could add another Zl 20,000bn to the total, he said.
In an attempt to bring the deficit under control the government has cut
energy subsidies and reduced unemployment pay, setting off unrest.
