FT  26 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Economic data fail to give
buyers incentive


   By PATRICK HARVERSON


   NEW YORK


Wall Street
US STOCKS had just a slightly firmer tone in subdued trading yesterday as
news of weakening consumer confidence offset another decline in bond yields,
writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 8.85 up at 3,516.63. The Standard &
Poor's 500 firmed 0.86 to 448.85, while the Nasdaq composite gained 0.35 at
695.04. New York SE volume was 222.8m shares.
For the second consecutive day, business on the US stock markets was
relatively light, with investors choosing to stay on the sidelines until a
clearer picture of either the state of the economy, or the direction of
monetary policy, emerges.
Uncertainty surrounding President Bill Clinton's economic plan, which goes
to the vote in the House of Representatives tomorrow, also frightened some
investors away.
News on the economy failed to provide any incentive to buy stocks yesterday.
Although there was positive news, in the form of a 2.7 per cent rise in
April existing home sales, there was also some bad economic news as the
Conference Board announced that its index of consumer confidence fell to
61.5 in May, down from 67.7 in April. The decline was much larger than
analysts had expected, and took the index to its lowest level in six months.
Although the consumer confidence data depressed market sentiment, early
gains in bond prices, which temporarily pushed the yield on the 30-year
issue below 7 per cent, supported stocks. Even a late turnround in bonds
failed to push equities into negative territory.
Amax jumped Dollars 4 1/4 to Dollars 22 3/4 in volume of 3.9m shares on news
that the company will merge with Cyprus Minerals to form a new group with
assets of about Dollars 5bn and combined revenues of Dollars 2.8bn. This did
not encourage investors in Cyprus Minerals, which fell Dollars 1 to Dollars
26 5/8 .
First Chicago rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 38 after Warburg Securities
upgraded its rating on the banking group's stock from a 'hold' to a 'buy'.
Other banks were firmer as fears of a rise in interest rates receded.
Citicorp put on Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 28 1/8 , Chemical Dollars  1/2 at
Dollars 37 3/8 and Chase Manhattan Dollars 1 at Dollars 30 1/4 .
Wal-Mart firmed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 28 3/8 in busy trade after the
retailer launched a Dollars 1bn issue of new debt securities. The issue is
Wal-Mart's second big cash-raising exercise this year: in late-February it
sold Dollars 750m of five-year and 10-year notes.
On the Nasdaq market, Dell Computer plummeted Dollars 7 3/8 , or more than
20 per cent, to Dollars 24 3/4 in volume of 13m shares after the company
reported a sharp drop in first-quarter net income to 25 cents a share.
Canada
TORONTO, after Monday's holiday closure, made headway in most sectors,
contrasting with a setback in the high-flying gold shares group. The latter,
which has led the market in recent sessions, eased in spite of a stronger
close in gold futures.
The TSE 300 index climbed 23.9 to 3,859.9 and rises outscored declines by
394 to 298 after volume of 76.2m shares valued at CDollars 572.8m.
The Bank of Canada key rate fell to 5.10 per cent from 5.40 per cent, which
could prompt the leading Canadian banks to cut prime lending rates from 6
per cent. Second-quarter earnings reports from the six big banks also begin
tomorrow.
