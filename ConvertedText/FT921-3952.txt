FT  12 MAR 92 / Chile denies political asylum to Honecker

   SANTIAGO, MOSCOW


CHILE will not grant political asylum to Mr Erich Honecker, the deposed East
German leader who took refuge in the Chilean embassy in Moscow in December,
President Patricio Aylwin of Chile said yesterday, write Leslie Crawford in
Santiago and John Lloyd in Moscow.
Chilean officials would negotiate Mr Honecker's situation with German and
Russian officials in Moscow, Mr Aylwin said. Mr Clodomiro Almeyda, Chile's
ambassador to Moscow and an old friend of Mr Honecker's, was recalled to
Santiago over the weekend. The case has been effectively removed from his
hands.
Mr Aylwin said it was not his government's intention to shield Mr Honecker
from German justice.
Mr Honecker is to be allowed to leave the embassy to be treated in a Moscow
hospital, according to German diplomats in Moscow.
Mr Honecker, who is 79, has been in the embassy for two-and-a-half months
following a demand from the German government that he be sent back to face
charges of ordering the shooting of East Germans fleeing to the west. His
wife, Margot, says Mr Honecker has cancer and kidney problems.
