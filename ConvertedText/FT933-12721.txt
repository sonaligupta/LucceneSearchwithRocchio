FT  22 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): German M3 data counterbalance
repo rate cut


   By Our Markets Staff


THE rise in German M3, coupled with a growing, but not universal, belief
that the Bundesbank is now unlikely to cut interest rates again before its
summer recess, left many markets weaker yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT liked a repo rate cut of 13 basis points to 7.15 per cent, but the
DAX index still incorporated Tuesday's post-bourse declines to close 15.18
lower at 1,823.81. In the afternoon, prices wavered in response to a rise in
Germany's M3 money supply growth indicator to 7.1 per cent, against the 6.6
per cent expected by most analysts.
Turnover fell from DM9.2bn to DM8.2bn. Mr Nigel Longley of Commerzbank said
that the bank was still a bull of the market, on indications that M3 will
get into its target 4.5 to 6.5 per cent growth 'corridor' in the second half
of this year, and in the expectation of a key interest rate cut next week.
Profit-taking hit both cyclicals, strong in the June quarter, and more
defensive stocks like utilities which have picked up in the past few days.
Daimler dropped DM9.50 to DM6.80 in carmakers, Thyssen shed DM7.50 to DM206
in steels and Viag, the ultility-based conglomerate, lost some of its recent
excitement with a fall of DM4.90 to DM393.30. However Mr Longley, like other
dealers, thought yesterday's fall a healthy reaction after a 140-point DAX
gain in just over a fortnight.
PARIS anticipated weakness in the bond market and fell sharply before
picking up some strength just before the close. The CAC-40 index ended off
20.91 or 1 per cent at 1,947.53, after a day's low of 1,939.
Turnover was estimated at FFr2.3bn.
In the automotive sector Peugeot closed FFr10 lower at FFr608 while Valeo
went against the trend with a rise of FFr8 to FFr897.
Flemings, in a recent research document on the European automotive industry,
gives a fairly positive long-term outlook for Peugeot, in spite of a gloomy
earnings outlook for 1993 and 1994. However, the brokers remark that efforts
by the group to improve productivity and keep manufacturing costs in check
should help it raise earnings potential from 1995 compared with other
European car manufacturers.
In contrast, James Capel yesterday issued a sell note on Valeo, which has
risen 22 per cent since its year's low in May, arguing that there is
considerable downside risk if the 'vague expectations of some form of a
corporate deal involving Cerus' (which has a 35 per cent stake in the group)
do not develop.
BSN was the day's most active issue, as the shares declined another FFr9 to
FFr833, with selling seen from the UK.
Unconfirmed reports of a possible agreement in the dispute between
Eurotunnel and TML contributed to the shares gaining 90 centimes or 2.5 per
cent to FFr36.30.
Alcatel slipped FFr4 to FFr641 after it said that it was buying a unit of
Northern Telecom of Canada, thereby creating the world's biggest undersea
cables group.
ZURICH regained a measure of composure after some heavy early selling had
continued Tuesday's market correction. The SMI index finished 9.0 lower at
2,315.1, after a day's low of 2,281.6.
UBS bearers again led the market lower, losing SFr6 to SFr1,119, while
Nestle, actively sold by foreign investors, dipped SFr16 to SFr1,032.
Insurers picked up after Tuesday's falls as it became clear that much of the
US flood damage was not insured. Zurich Insurance bearers and registered
shares added SFr38 and SFr40 respectively, both to SFr1,190.
Brown Boveri continued against the trend, adding SFr18 to SFr875.
MILAN made a firm start, before worries about the weakness of the lira
against the dollar and the D-Mark prompted a round of profit-taking which
left the Comit index 3.37 lower at 558.37.
A rise to 9.66 per cent in the average rate at the Bank of Italy's
repurchase tender, compared with the previous 9.34 per cent, was also higher
than the market had been expecting.
Olivetti's strong run came to an abrupt halt with a fall of L88 or 4.8 per
cent to L1,818, although it remains supported by expectations that it will
win the franchise for Italy's second mobile telephone operator.
Ferruzzi picked up another L25 or 6.5 per cent to L409.5 and Montedison was
L29.5 or 4.5 per cent higher at L680 on rising hopes for the rescue plan
being arranged by creditor banks.
AMSTERDAM's weakness continued with a fall in the CBS Tendency index of 1.0
to 116.2.
Nedlloyd rose on early reports that it might be seeking joint ventures or
mergers for its container shipping division, before falling back on a denial
by the group, to close off 10 cents at Fl 39.00.
Unilever pulled back from a year's low, ending off 60 cents at Fl 187.10
while DSM fell Fl 1.10 to Fl 96.90 ahead of second quarter results next week
which are expected to be disappointing.
STOCKHOLM ended its recent rally as domestic interest rates were increased
and profit-taking set in. The Affarsvarlden general index lost 13.30 to
1,142.40 as turnover slipped to SKr914m from SKr963m.
