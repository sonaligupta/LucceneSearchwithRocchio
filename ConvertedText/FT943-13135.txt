FT  21 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei little changed
despite yen's decline


   By EMIKO TERAZONO


   TOKYO


Selling by corporate investors eroded morning gains, and the Nikkei index
closed almost flat in spite of the yen's decline against the dollar, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average was finally a slight 5.60 up at 20,780.76 after
setting a day's high of 20,872.37 in the morning and a low of 20,736.95 in
the afternoon.
Arbitrage buying led by strength in the futures market and purchases by
public funds supported shares in early trading, but most investors failed to
participate and the index moved in a narrow range after receding on
profit-taking.
Volume was 310m shares, against 260m. Domestic financial institutions were
buying in the morning for public pension funds, while overseas investors
were largely inactive.
The Topix index of all first section stocks put on 1.19 at 1,665.49 and the
Nikkei 300 gained 0.13 at 302.22. Rising issues narrowly outscored declines
by 484 to 473, with 227 stocks unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
ended 2.12 firmer at 1,354.59.
Some investors selected smaller shares backed by individual news, or those
seen as laggards. The second section climbed 12.17 to 2,531.55 in volume of
21m shares, a three-week high. Many brokers do not expect equity prices to
move over the summer months. 'There will not be any significant earnings
news now until September, or until Toyota's results are announced in
August,' reported James Capel in Tokyo.
Nihon Nosan Kogyo, the agro-feed maker, advanced Y17 to Y549 on reports that
the company had developed a product which could lower blood sugar levels.
Telecommunication linked stocks were higher on hopes of profits from the
next-generation portable telephone. DDI, the long distance telecom operator,
rose Y110,000 to Y9.6m on the second section. The company was also supported
by hopes of increased buying following its 10-for-one stock split on August
2.
Kyocera, DDI's leading shareholder, moved ahead Y70 to Y7,500, while Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone added Y4,000 at Y854,000.
Fuji Electric appreciated Y10 to Y598 on buying by foreign brokers, while
Kumagai Gumi, the contractor, firmed a marginal Y1 to Y527.
Large-capital issues were lower on profit-taking, with Nippon Steel, the
day's most active stock, easing Y1 to Y341 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries
dipping Y8 to Y796.
In Osaka, the OSE average edged forward 1.97 to 23,205.81 in volume of 32.3m
shares.
Roundup
Foreign demand helped some Pacific Rim markets ahead.
HONG KONG finished modestly higher after profit-taking had pulled the market
back from its best level of the day. The Hang Seng index gained a net 43.81
at 9,188.82, having earlier touched 9,322.72.
Further foreign institutional demand was reported for blue chips, but local
funds and retail investors continued to take profits and unwind long
positions.
SYDNEY rebounded from lows to finish fractionally ahead as investors awaited
Mr Alan Greenspan's testimony before the US Congress.
Volatile futures and lacklustre performances in some other markets dragged
the All Ordinaries index to an intraday low of 2,060.7, but it later
recovered to end 1.3 firmer at 2,078.6 in cautious trade.
WELLINGTON was spurred 1.3 per cent ahead in high volume which indicated
active investment from overseas. The NZSE-40 Capital index climbed 27.23 to
2,054.94 in NZDollars 75.5m turnover.
SINGAPORE regained some momentum, after two slack days, on the back of
renewed orders for blue chips by institutional funds in Hong Kong, the US
and Britain. The Straits Times Industrial index rose 26.45 to 2,231.37.
KUALA LUMPUR saw foreign demand for blue chips which took the composite
index up 10.52 to 1,009.72. Gains were led by Genting, which firmed MDollars
1 to MDollars 33 ahead of the ex-date for its one-for-two bonus issue on
July 28.
BANGKOK rose in active trade, mainly on expectations of healthy first-half
results but also on optimism over dollar stability and the possible
extension of trading hours from November. The SET index put on 14.65 at
1,363.59 in active turnover of Bt13.8bn.
TAIPEI ended lower on late, heavy profit-taking as investors turned cautious
ahead of a central bank board meeting today which raised worries about
tighter monetary policy.
The weighted index lost 52.09 at 6,474.30, off a 6,590.67 day's high.
Turnover declined to TDollars 105.95bn from TDollars 119.02bn.
MANILA finished easier after profit-taking in blue chips ended a four-day
rally. The composite index shed 5.60 points to 2,663.46, off the day's low
of 2,647. Heavy foreign buying in SM Prime Holdings broke the fall at
midsession and the retail group jumped 1.7 per cent to 6 pesos.
SEOUL declined for the sixth session in a row as a lack of institutional
activity took its toll. The composite index lost 2.38 at 936.67.
