FT  24 AUG 92 / The Markets Under Strain: Currency tacticians ready to
defend pound


   By PETER MARSH


THE TACTICS of the Treasury and the Bank of England in propping up the pound
will be tested today, when sterling is expected to come under renewed
pressure on currency markets.
After the pound's sharp fall on Friday night, when it traded perilously
close to its floor against the D-Mark in the European exchange rate
mechanism, UK monetary officials spent the weekend thinking of ways to
defend the currency without a politically damaging rise in interest rates.
Some economists believe, however, the chances for a rescue of the currency
are slim. Mr John Shepperd, an economist at SG Warburg Securities, the
investment group, said: 'There's been a steady reduction in confidence in
sterling. We may be moving into a crisis.'
Mr Keith Skeoch, chief UK economist at brokers James Capel, believes UK
monetary authorities have 'a credibility problem' due to their lack of
success in arresting sterling's recent decline. He thinks there is a 'good
chance' of a rise in base rates, now at 10 per cent, in the next few days.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, has attempted to lift the currency
throughout the pound's 15-pfennig slide over the past three months to
DM2.7975 at the London close on Friday night.
He has issued determined statements that Britain will keep the currency in
its existing ERM band around a central rate of DM2.95. The essence of this
message is that investors who sell the pound when it approaches its ERM
floor of DM2.778 will lose money, as the UK will never allow the limit to be
breached.
Mr Lamont's strategy has been buttressed by modest and discreet intervention
by the Bank, mainly in the Far East, to buy sterling for other currencies,
chiefly D-Marks, to lift the value of the pound. The Bank has also joined
three highly public operations by other central banks during the past month
 -including moves by the US Federal Reserve and the Bundesbank - to buy
dollars for D-Marks, and so depress the German currency.
The strength of the D-Mark - caused by the difference of 6.75 percentage
points between German and US short-term interest rates - has been one of the
main components of sterling's recent difficulties.
But UK efforts to buoy the pound may have run out of steam. The main
obstacles have been:
D-Mark resilience. The interventions by central banks to lower the value of
the German currency - the last one being on Friday - have failed. The dollar
fell below its all-time low of DM1.4430 against the D-Mark on Friday, and
this helped to push down sterling.
Mr Jim O'Neill, head of financial markets research at Swiss Bank
Corporation, said: 'The dollar may be set for bigger falls, and I don't
think the central banks can do much about it.' Economic gloom. In recent
weeks the economic outlook has worsened. At the end of May the consensus
among private-sector economists was that UK output this year would rise by
0.8 per cent. The latest average forecast, according to Consensus Economics,
a consultancy firm, is for a 0.5 per cent decline. Such sentiments have
knocked market confidence and helped persuade investors to sell sterling.
Devaluation worries. In spite of Mr Lamont and Mr John Major, the prime
minister, stressing Britain's ERM commitment, doubts remain about whether
the UK might devalue should the pound fall too far - especially if raising
interest rates was the only alternative.
Some large UK companies, hedging bets about a possible devaluation, have
been among sellers of sterling in the past week. Maastricht concern. The
financial markets are worried about the possibility of a large 'no' vote in
the French referendum on ratification of the Maastricht treaty on September
20. Such a result would almost certainly halt progress towards economic and
monetary union. It might also damage confidence in the ERM, undermining weak
currencies such as the pound. As the referendum nears, these fears will give
investors more excuses to switch out of sterling.
Where does this leave Mr Lamont and his advisers? One option is for the Bank
to intervene heavily and publicly to buy the pound for D-Marks.
Such an operation would convince investors of Britain's determination to use
its foreign-currency reserves - which add up to Dollars 45.7bn (Pounds
23.5bn) and include a substantial proportion of D-Marks - to defend its
currency.
If intervention of this sort failed to relieve pressure on sterling the only
other alternative, assuming devaluation remained a non-starter, would be to
raise UK base rates. Such a move would reverse Britain's progress in
bringing base rates down by 5 percentage points from 15 per cent since it
joined the ERM in October 1990.
The move, coming when Britain is still locked in recession, would also, to
ERM critics, underline the perverse results of sticking to the mechanism's
rules.
But some commentators - including Mr O'Neill of Swiss Bank - think Britain
will convince markets that it believes in the ERM only if it demonstrates
its preparedness to increase borrowing rates as well as lower them.
Mr O'Neill said intervention was unlikely to be effective in boosting the
pound, Rather, the government should immediately increase base rates by 1
percentage point. With luck, the rise in rates could soon be reversed,
assuming that sterling strengthened.
He said: 'If Mr Major wants us to believe the ERM is valuable, he should
back up his words with action.'
