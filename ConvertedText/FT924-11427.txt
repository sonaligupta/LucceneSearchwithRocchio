FT  26 OCT 92 / International Company News: Usborne returns to profit as
property activities cease


USBORNE, the pig breeder and grain merchanting company, returned to profits
in the six months to June 30 following its decision to withdraw from
property development.
On turnover of Pounds 101.2m (Pounds 90.6m) pre-tax profits were Pounds
833,000 compared with losses of Pounds 3.75m, which was struck after a
Pounds 4.4m provision on a development joint venture and losses of
discontinued businesses.
Mr Derek Sawyer, chairman, said that all the residential properties owned by
Usborne Developments had been sold and some letting of commercial properties
were being achieved in difficult circumstances. Overheads of Usborne
Developments were being cut to a minimum.
Earnings per share were 0.92p (losses 4.9p) and the interim dividend is
being doubled to 0.2p after having been cut from 0.5p the previous year.
Operating profits in grain merchanting improved to Pounds 755,000 compared
with Pounds 580,000 while pig production advanced to Pounds 430,000 against
Pounds 191,000.
Mr Sawyer said that withdrawal from the ERM should be helpful to agriculture
in the short term and he hoped that the violent swings in the pig market
experienced in previous cycles may be avoided this year.
The company has changed its year end to June 30. There will be a second
interim report for the period to December 31 1992.
