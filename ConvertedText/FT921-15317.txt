FT  10 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Gilts


With long gilt yields heading down towards 9 per cent, a level seen only
fleetingly in the past decade, the prospects of an ultra-long issue this
year are growing. When the Bank of England resumed borrowing last year it
confined itself to a maximum maturity of 20 years, partly because of the
high absolute level of rates and partly to tap large overseas demand for
10-year paper. A prospective doubling of new issuance in 1992-93 and heavy
corporate borrowing of 10-year funds now suggest the need for a 25 - year or
even 30-year benchmark issue of some Pounds 3-4bn in all, designed to appeal
to domestic institutions.
The question is one of timing. The Bank is not currently under particular
funding pressure. It will also want a rate low enough to avoid the
imputation that it has less than total faith in Britain's long-term ability
to restrain inflation by keeping sterling in the ERM. The risk of exchange
market upsets before the election argues for delay till the summer or
autumn. If Labour wins, however, the opportunity may then be lost, as
institutions could demand an unacceptable premium for long-term money. The
funding constraints on Labour would thus be twofold. Not only would its
borrowing requirement prompt higher overall rates: it might also have to
bunch its funding towards the short to medium end of the maturity spectrum.
