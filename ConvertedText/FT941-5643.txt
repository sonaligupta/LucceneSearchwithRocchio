FT  05 MAR 94 / Le Monde choice


   By ALICE RAWSTHORN


   PARIS


Le Monde yesterday reverted to its practice of appointing a journalist to
head the influential French daily, naming Mr Jean-Marie Colombani as
publishing director following the resignation of Mr Pierre Lescoure after a
row over his cost cutting plans, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris. Mr
Colombani, 45, the newspaper's editorial director, faces a tough task in
returning the paper to profit.
