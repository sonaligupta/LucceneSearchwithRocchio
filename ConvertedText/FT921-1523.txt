FT  24 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Steam Packet moves ahead to Pounds 4.1m

THE ISLE of Man Steam Packet Company announced a 21 per cent increase in
pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.3m to Pounds 4,1m for 1991.
The result was struck on turnover up from Pounds 22.4m to Pounds 24.1m.
Earnings per share increased by 22 per cent to 23.6p (19.3p) and a final
dividend of 7p (6p) is proposed for an improved total of 10p (8p).
Mr Norman Corlett, chairman, said the improvement reflected an increased
share of passenger arrivals to the Isle of Man from 47.5 per cent to 50.5
per cent and showed the benefit of operating fewer but better ships.
Mr James Sherwood's Sea Containers has a 41 per cent stake in the company,
and in June, 1990, launched a takeover bid.
As the company provided the Isle of Man's only lifeline, the bid produced an
emotive response from islanders. The Manx government threated retrospective
legislation forbidding any person or company to own more than 15 per cent of
the company's shares.
The legislation was not enacted, but Sea Containers withdrew its offer.
Last year, Mr Sherwood said he was predisposed to make another bid. Under
Stock Exchange rules, he is free to do so, but so far has not announced any
move.
