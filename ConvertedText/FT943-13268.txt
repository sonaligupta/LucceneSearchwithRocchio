FT  20 JUL 94 / UK Company News: British Gas and US affiliate form joint
venture to trade fuel


   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor


British Gas and its part-owned US affiliate Natural Gas Clearinghouse have
formed a joint venture to trade fuel in the UK.
The new company, Accord Energy, would combine BG's strength in the UK market
with NGC's commercial skills and experience of trading in the deregulated
North American market, according to Mr Russell Herbert, the managing
director of BG Global Gas who will be its chairman.
Initially, the company will focus on trading short term gas in the wholesale
market, and will support the development of a liquid spot market in the UK.
Later, it will expand internationally, and include other fuels such as oil,
electricity, liquified gas and derivative products.
The new company will be 51 per cent owned by BG and 49 per cent by NGC.
British Gas owns 39 per cent of NGC which is one of the leading gatherers,
processors and marketers of natural gas in the US.
