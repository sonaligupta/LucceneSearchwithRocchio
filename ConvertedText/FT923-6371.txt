FT  25 AUG 92 / Observer: Back to basics


If only the dear old Trustee Savings Bank had been left to run itself rather
than be hijacked by lots of clever types from the City establishment, it
would not be in its present unhappy state.
Yesterday saw one new broom  - former Amex plastic card whiz Don McCrickard
 - be replaced at the helm by another new broom, Peter Ellwood, who made his
name at Barclaycard. McCrickard had been group chief executive for just over
two and a half years, while Ellwood has only been with the TSB for a shade
over three years.
However good or bad they are, neither has had long enough to prove
themselves. The revolving door at the top of the TSB is reminiscent of the
Midland Bank at the low point in its fortunes. Isn't it about time that the
TSB returned to its roots and hired some old-fashioned bankers. Better still
why not promote from within?
