FT  05 AUG 93 / BT signs Pounds 5m test deal with suppliers


BRITISH Telecommunications has signed contracts with US and French suppliers
to test equipment that could lead to the next generation of
telecommunications network switches - the devices which route information
carried on telephone lines.
The contracts, with American Telephone and Telegraph of the US and Alcatel
of France, are for asynchronous transfer mode switches, which can handle far
greater capacity at greater speed.
Although the initial contracts are for only about Pounds 5m, trials of the
switches could lead to contracts worth hundreds of millions for the next
generation of equipment.
