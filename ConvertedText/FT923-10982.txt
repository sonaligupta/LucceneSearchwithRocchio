FT  28 JUL 92 / US recovery fears heightened


   By GEORGE GRAHAM


FALLING house sales and weaker business confidence have reinforced
economists' fears that the US recovery, already one of the slowest on
record, may once again be losing steam, writes George Graham.
The National Association of Realtors said yesterday the sales of previously
owned houses fell 2.9 per cent in June, the third consecutive monthly drop.
Although home sales rose in the north-east, they fell sharply in the
mid-west and west.
'We've been experiencing a stall within a rise,' said Mr John Tuccillo, an
economist with the association.
At the same time an index of business confidence produced by Cahners
Economics, a Massachusetts-based forecasting group, showed a sharp drop in
July. The survey showed businesses were particularly pessimistic about the
chances of increasing workforces.
Mr Daryl Delano, senior economist at Cahners, said: 'These numbers are
fairly convincing evidence that the recovery had once again stalled before
the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut on July 2.'
He said the effect of lower interest rates had not become clear when
businesses were questioned, prompting an unusual degree of uncertainty among
planners.
Economists expect the rate cut to boost sales in coming months as mortgage
rates fall.
