FT  25 AUG 92 / International Company News: French results present gloomy
picture


   By ALICE RAWSTHORN


FRENCH companies continued yesterday to report lacklustre sales figures with
a number of industrial groups, including Compagnie de Navigation Mixte,
reporting flat or falling sales for the first half of the year.
Navigation Mixte, which has interests in finance, food and aeronautics, saw
its sales muster a negligible increase of less than 1 per cent to FFr8.71bn
(Dollars 1.74bn) in the first six months of 1992 from FFr8.63bn in the same
period of 1991. This means its interim turnover fell below inflation, now
running at an annual rate of around 3 per cent in France.
During the half Navigation Mixte, in common with many other French
companies, was affected by the sluggish state of France's economy. Low
inflation has helped French exporters to win back market share in the
international sphere, but their domestic market has been depressed by the
high cost of borrowing which has curbed industrial investment and dented
consumer confidence.
The CAC 40 Index, which has fallen sharply recently due to the dollar's
decline and nervousness about the outcome of next month's Maastricht
referendum, as well as the poor interim results, yesterday fell again by
3.12 per cent to reach its lowest level so far this year of 1,680.
Several other French groups yesterday disclosed disappointing interim
turnover figures. Gerland, the clothing company acquired by BP France,
announced a 2.3 per cent fall in turnover to FFr1.96bn in the first half.
Guyomarch, the food and agricultural products group, saw sales fall by 1.8
per cent to FFr3.42bn in the first six months of the year.
Metrologie International, the specialist information company which had
warned the stock market it expected a FFr60m interim loss this year,
reported an 18.1 per cent reduction in first-half sales to FFr1.74bn. Nord
Est, one of the holding companies associated with the Paribas banking group,
made sales of FFr1.93bn in the first half of 1992, after making several
disposals since last year.
