FT  27 JUN 92 / The Lisbon Summit: Germans in deal on Maastricht


   By QUENTIN PEEL


   BONN


THE constitution committee of the German parliament yesterday agreed on a
new clause on European union to be inserted in the German constitution,
opening the way for ratification of the Maastricht treaty.
The German government, however, has reserved its position, and may yet seek
to water down the clause, which would significantly increase the powers of
the 16 federal states in future EC negotiations.
The compromise requires any future transfer of sovereignty to the European
Community to be approved by the 16 states in the Bundesrat, the upper house
of the German parliament. That needs a two-thirds majority.
More controversially for the government, it also means involving the states
in day-to-day negotiations in Brussels. The government would have to heed
the views of the states wherever their authority wasaffected.
The amendment also includes provision for non-German EC citizens to vote in
local elections, and for the powers of the German Bundesbank to be
transferred to a European central bank.
