FT  20 APR 91 / UK Company News: Pay cuts for Pearson directors


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


THE DIRECTORS of Pearson, the publishing, banking and industrial group
suffered a sizeable cut in income last year.
Their earnings dropped dramatically because a large proportion of
remuneration is linked to the performance of earnings per share which fell
by 13 per cent last year against a 20 per cent rise in 1989.
As a result Lord Blakenham, chairman and chief executive of the group that
also publishes the Financial Times, saw his earnings cut to Pounds 265,000
from Pounds 465,000 in 1989.
The pay of Mr Frank Barlow, former chief executive of the FT and now chief
operating officer and group managing director of Pearson, dropped from more
than Pounds 395,000 to something over Pounds 210,000. Two other executive
directors, Mr James Joll, the finance director, and Mr Mark Burrell, earned
between Pounds 205,000 and Pounds 215,000 compared with between Pounds
355,000 and Pounds 380,000 in 1989.
Mr Luke Glass, director of corporate affairs, conceded yesterday that the
curve on performance-related pay went steeply upwards when the company's
earnings per share went steaming ahead. 'There is an equally steep curve
waiting for them on the downside and this year that's what happened.'
Mr Barlow supplemented his salary last week by exercising 10,000 Pearson
share options at 303p and selling them at 730p - a gain of Pounds 42,700.
The Pearson chief operating officer now holds 1,127 shares and options on a
further 206,183 shares.
Over the year Pearson's charitable donations totalled Pounds 871,000. It
also made a donation of Pounds 25,000 to the Conservative Party.
In 1990 Pearson's pre-tax profits were Pounds 226m (Pounds 250.5m). It made
a Pounds 71.4m provision against its commitments to BSkyB, the satellite
television venture in which it has a 14 per cent stake.
