FT  23 OCT 92 / International Company News: Ford sees Dollars 174m deficit


   By MARTIN DICKSON


FORD Motor, the US vehicles group, indicated yesterday that it expected to
lose around Dollars 174m in the third quarter.
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission Ford said it
expected losses in the period to be 'about Dollars 400m less than the
Dollars 574m loss in the third quarter a year ago'.
The figure is in the middle of analysts' expectations, which range from
around Dollars 110m to Dollars 200m.
Ford, which plans to release its results next week, said it expected
'continued improvement in earnings over 1992, assuming that US and European
economic conditions and industry volumes improve'.
The company also said it had increased the sum it intended to raise under an
offering of perpetual preferred stock from Dollars 1bn to Dollars 1.15bn.
