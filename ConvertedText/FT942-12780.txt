FT  28 APR 94 / PIA chairman pressed by MPs


   By ALISON SMITH


Mr Joe Palmer, chairman of the Personal Investment Authority, yesterday came
under renewed pressure from Labour MPs about his fitness to lead the new
regulating body intended to protect the private investor.
Mr Brian Sedgemore, a Labour member of the cross-party Commons Treasury
committee, pressed Mr Palmer on the record of insurance company Legal &
General, of which he was previously chief executive.
Last month, failures to meet standards set by the existing regulator cost
Legal & General some Pounds 400,000 in a then-record fine and in costs. Mr
Palmer pointed out that his time as chief executive - until autumn 1991 -
had represented only a slight portion of the period in which the breaches of
regulatory rules had occurred.
But Mr Sedgemore also raised with Mr Palmer an internal L&G memorandum from
1990 suggesting that there were widespread breaches of the rules by sales
consultants.
Mr Palmer insisted that the L&G paper related largely to one instance. He
argued that he did not condone the abuse suggested in the internal
memorandum, but that one 'isolated case' did not amount to sufficient
grounds for challenging his integrity and suitability to be chairman of the
PIA.
During the course of the inquiry into financial regulation, MPs have clearly
been concerned to ensure that the PIA should command public confidence.
The committee itself seemed reassured yesterday by the PIA's statement that
it would consider moving to a system of directly registering employees of
life companies in a way that would enable the PIA to discipline individuals
as well as companies.
The MPs are set to decide early next month whether to publish an interim
report dealing with the PIA, as the full report is very unlikely to be ready
much before the end of this year - some months after the organisation is due
to become operational.
