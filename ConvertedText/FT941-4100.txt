FT  12 MAR 94 / Testing time for wind farms


   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor


The wind energy industry has been warned it must overcome objections that
wind farms are noisy and spoil the landscape if it wants government
subsidies.
Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, said yesterday that if the industry was
to develop 'it must find sites which are acceptable to the planning
process'.
In the past, the government has stressed the environmental benefits of wind
power while playing down criticisms of their noise and visual impact.
Mr Eggar also said wind farms would only get financial support if there was
a prospect that they would produce electricity at market prices. Like most
renewable forms of energy, wind power is several times more expensive than
conventional sources.
Mr Eggar's comments came as the Department of Trade and Industry released
details of applications for the latest round of the non-fossil fuel
obligation, the scheme to subsidise renewable energy projects. Of the 650
applications for financial help - including small-scale hydroelectric
schemes, and heat from waste and tidal power projects - some 230 were wind
farms. However Mr Eggar doubted that more than 20 wind farms would be
approved for subsidy.
'This will depend on developers' abilities to find sufficient windy sites
which are acceptable in planning terms,' he said. Successful bidders will be
announced at the end of this year.
Mr Joseph Lythgoe, a leading anti-wind farm campaigner, said Mr Eggar
appeared to be 'trimming his sails', although 20 new wind farms would treble
the number already in operation.
Friends of the Earth, the environmental group, accused Mr Eggar of imposing
'an arbitrary limit' on wind farms before the local planning process had
assessed individual projects.
Dr Ian Mays, chairman of the British Wind Energy Association, said
competition would ensure that only the most cost effective and
environmentally acceptable projects went ahead.
