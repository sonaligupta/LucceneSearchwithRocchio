FT  25 MAR 92 / Insurance Ombudsman's Report: Compensation to complainants
totalled Pounds 5m last year


   By JOHN AUTHERS


MONEY paid to people who complained to Mr Julian Farrand, the insurance
ombudsman, totalled Pounds 5m last year, he disclosed yesterday. The number
of cases dealt with by his staff rose 64 per cent to 4,334 in the year, and
he said he expected the total to rise to some 5,000 this year.
Cases dealt with were 'the tip of the iceberg,' he continued. There were
13,899 written inquiries last year and 26,048 by telephone.
He said the rise had been caused by the recession, which gave consumers more
incentive to complain, and the arrival of the Financial Services Act, which
has tightened regulation. Complainants were successful in only 32 per cent
of cases.
In the biggest award, of Pounds 500,000, an insurance company queried
whether its policyholder, a woman reported dead while on a visit to Kenya,
had indeed died. A private detective sent to Africa reported that she was
dead, but the company then claimed that she could not have been of
sufficient means to justify covering her life for such a large sum. Mr
Farrand said no question had been asked about her means when she took out
the policy, and called on the company to pay the full Pounds 500,000.
In another case, a salesman was asked to explain why he had sold a life
assurance policy, with no savings element, to an unmarried 18-year-old with
no children who wanted to save. 'The reason I did not attempt to sell a
capital accumulation plan (a 10-year savings plan) is because in February
1988 I was unaware the plan existed,' the salesman said. 'Perhaps if my
training had included the plan, I would have marketed it more often.' The
ombudsman decided the entire sale had been unsuitable.
In another case where the ombudsman found for the complainant, an
independent intermediary had forged his client's signature on a form
allowing him to surrender an endowment policy written in his client's name.
He took the proceeds and disappeared.
The insurance company involved refused to reinstate the endowment because it
said that the signatures were apparently genuine.
The rates by which the insurance company's original decision was revised
varied according to the type of insurance. Only 25 per cent of general
insurance complaints were upheld, while life assurance had a greater rate.
Mr Farrand pointed out that life policies were more complicated than general
insurance. He did not believe the complaints about life insurance indicated
any widespread scandal.
The Securities and Investments Board published the results of its review of
investment retail regulation two weeks ago, recommending that many details
should be made clearer at the point of sale. SIB hopes this will reduce
investor confusion and reduce the number of complaints.
In two thirds of cases, the insurance company's decision was upheld, and the
report includes several examples of dishonest claims.
A pensioner said a breakdown ruined 93lb of meat in his freezer. An
investigation showed that the freezer could hold only about 42lb.
The Investors Compensation Scheme has paid out Pounds 10.8m so far in the
present financial year compared with only Pounds 1.7m in 1990-91, SIB said
yesterday.
SIB believes pay-outs are being affected by the effects of new regulations
and by the recession, which is depriving intermediaries of the commissions
they earn when long-term policies are renewed.
