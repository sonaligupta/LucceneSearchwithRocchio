FT  29 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Uganda's biological cobalt
project


   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent


UGANDA WILL become a substantial cobalt producer, contributing about 5 per
cent of western world output, if the government supports a Dollars 54m
project proposed by BRGM, the state-owned French mining group, and Barclays
Metals, the metals trading subsidiary of Barclays Bank of the UK.
It would also be the first time that thiobacillus ferro-oxidans, the
naturally-occuring bacteria that is being used by some copper, gold and
uranium miners to liberate their metals from ore, would be employed in
cobalt production.
For the partners claim that bioleaching is not only the least costly way of
extracting Uganda's cobalt, it is also the most environment-friendly method.
They suggest they can produce 1,000 tonnes a year which would be profitable
with the cobalt price at its long-term historic average of Dollars 10 to
Dollars 12 a lb.
Environmental issues are important because Uganda's cobalt is in 1.1m tonnes
of pyrites stockpiled at the old Kilembe copper mine on the edge of the
Queen Elizabeth National Park in south-west Uganda.
Copper production at Kilembe stopped in 1972 since when various methods to
recover the cobalt have been looked at and found to be either too expensive
or too polluting.
BRGM (Bureau de Recherches Geologiques et Minieres) has been developing the
proposed bioleaching process over several years. There have been 'excellent'
recovery rates under pilot test conditions, according to Barclays Metals,
formerly known as Deak International Trading, which was acquired by the UK
bank 18 months ago.
Barclays Metals said yesterday that, together with BRGM, it was ready to
sign a joint venture with the Ugandan government to carry out a Dollars 4m
feasibility study which should lead to the construction of a Dollars 50m
bioleaching plant at Kilembe.
Negotiations about finance were well advanced with a number of agencies.
It would take about two and a half years from the time the go-ahead was
given for the feasibility study to move into full production, said Barclays
Metals. The Ugandan government would own 45 per cent of the project with
BRGM, the technical agent, and Barclays, the marketing agent, each owning 27
1/2 per cent.
Ironically, the present high cost of cobalt, an essential metal in some of
the superalloys used by the aerospace industry and for some motor industry
products, is causing some delays to the project. Cobalt has more than
doubled in price in the past few months because of production problems and
potential political upheavals in Zaire and Zambia, which between them
account for about 70 per cent of cobalt production outside the former
eastern bloc countries.
