FT  16 MAR 94 / Unions protest at injury cash curb


   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent


A group of unions has threatened legal action against Mr Michael Howard, the
home secretary, over plans to reform the criminal injuries compensation
system and replace individual assessments with a fixed tariff from April 1.
Unions representing nurses, firefighters, train drivers, teachers, local
authority workers and bank staff are concerned that the new scheme will
leave members worse off when they are seriously injured at work by criminal
assault.
Backed by the TUC, they claim that the home secretary is in breach of his
duty under the 1988 Criminal Justice Act in abolishing the criminal injuries
compensation board by parliamentary order, rather than by primary
legislation.
In a letter to Mr Howard, Mr Andrew Dismore of solicitors Robin Thompson and
Partners says the unions 'will have no option but to take appropriate legal
proceedings' unless the proposed scheme is withdrawn.
Legal action would take the form of an application to the courts for a
judge's order requiring the home secretary to cancel his plan.
'The unions have been forced to take the government to court as a last
resort to defend the interests of ordinary working people who are the
victims of violent crime during their employment,' said Mr Dismore
yesterday.
The unions concerned are the Fire Brigades union, the NASUWT teachers'
union, the Royal College of Nursing, Aslef, the train drivers' union, the
NatWest staff association and the general unions Unison, GMB and TGWU.
'My clients are deeply distressed that their members should be the victims
of a costcutting exercise by the government,' Mr Dismore says in his letter
to Mr Howard. 'Moreover I have advised my clients that the new scheme has
been introduced unconstitutionally and unlawfully.'
