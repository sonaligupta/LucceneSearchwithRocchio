FT  02 JUL 92 / Poland warned of early election


   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI


   WARSAW


THE prospect of an early election was raised in Poland yesterday when Mr
Waldemar Pawlak, prime minister-designate, told parliament he would resign
if it failed to support him.
The crisis came when Mr Pawlak, 32, leader of the Peasant Party, who was
designated premier less than a month ago, found himself all but abandoned by
three key parties with which he had hoped to form a government. He had
refused to relinquish control to them over economic policy.
Mr Pawlak said he would not present candidates for government posts, leaving
open the possibility of a last-minute compromise. If he quits, his would be
the shortest term of the four prime ministers since the Communists gave up
power in Poland in 1989.
The parliament contains about 10 key political groups all increasingly
unable to agree on a stable government majority. Should they fail, the 460
deputies can either accept a government proposed by President Lech Walesa or
go to the polls, less than a year after the last election.
President Walesa yesterday said he had started to consider dissolving
parliament but added he still had 'several solutions' on forming a
government, one of which included himself as prime minister.
The latest political crisis came against the background of an optimistic
economic forecast from the Warsaw Trade School's (SGH) economic monitoring
unit. It predicted continuing growth in industrial sales over the summer,
with rising exports and domestic sales as a devalued Zloty continues to
squeeze imports and boost sales abroad.
The forecast follows results for the first five months which suggested GDP
could grow 2 per cent this year, reversing three years' decline.
