FT  12 NOV 92 / International Company News: Berlitz charged with securities
violations


   By Our New York Staff


BERLITZ International, the Princeton-based language school and publishing
group, yesterday unveiled a steep drop in third-quarter net income and said
it had been charged with violating various securities laws mainly relating
to earlier financial results statements.
Berlitz, which Fukutake Publishing of Japan is seeking to acquire, said it
plans to 'contest vigorously the allegations set forth in such complaint'.
The suit, filed in the US district court of New Jersey, is part of a larger
body of litigation faced by Berlitz.
Most of the earlier litigation centres on about 56.5 per cent of the
company's shares pledged to banks last year as collateral for loans made to
the late Mr Robert Maxwell.
These shares were nominally owned by Macmillan, then part of the Maxwell
Communication Corporation (MCC). MCC is now operating under Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection and the status of the Berlitz shares is the subject of
various legal actions.
Berlitz posted net income for the three months to September 30 of Dollars
700,000, or 4 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 69.6m against Dollars 5.7m,
or 14 cents, on sales of Dollars 62.5m a year earlier.
The drop in net income was even steeper than the previously-reported decline
in operating earnings which fell to Dollars 1.7m from Dollars 5m.
