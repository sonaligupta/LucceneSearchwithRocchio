FT  27 MAR 92 / Price-cut battle for Pru audit


   By ANDREW JACK


FOUR leading accountancy firms offered big reductions from the existing fee
in attempts to win the contract to audit the Prudential, the UK's biggest
insurer, last year.
The information provides further evidence of the widespread incidence of
'low-balling', in which firms offer big reductions in their fees to win
business.
Mr Michael Lawrence, Prudential's finance director, disclosed that the
company's audit bill would be almost unchanged at nearly Pounds 2.5m for
last year, but is likely to show 'a significant reduction' this year.
The details follow months of speculation about the fees charged after a
leaked letter from Price Waterhouse, which won the audit contract, appeared
to show it offering a Pounds 900,000 discount on its originally quoted fee
of Pounds 2.3m.
That led to accusations that accountancy firms had either been making
abnormal profits in the past or were beginning to offer audit contracts as
loss-leaders during the recession.
Mr Lawrence said there had been 'a lot of hype' over the PW fees. He said
'you would need a microscope' to see the difference between the PW quote and
that of the Prudential's previous auditor, Deloitte Haskins & Sells, which
had just merged with Coopers & Lybrand at the time of the tender. KPMG Peat
Marwick and Ernst & Young also offered similar fees for the audit.
Mr Lawrence said PW had done 'an extremely good job' and suggested that the
reductions were made possible by 'a more surgical, strategic approach' to
the audit, which saved time and cost. The fee reduction shown in the PW
letter included non-audit work such as completion of forms for government
regulators.
