FT  15 NOV 93 / International Company News: Apple to license Mac software


   By LOUISE KEHOE


   SAN FRANCISCO


APPLE Computer has decided to license to other computer makers the software
that makes its Macintosh personal computers unique, Mr Michael Spindler,
Apple's new chief executive, told analysts.
The move comes after years of debate within Apple about allowing competitors
to access its software 'crown jewels'. It reflects Mr Spindler's new
strategy to broaden Apple's markets by abandoning the strict proprietary
software approach that the company has adhered to for more than a decade.
Apple has yet to say to whom it will license the Macintosh software, but
potential licensees are expected to include companies designing products
around the new PowerPC microprocessor, co-developed by IBM and Motorola,
upon which Apple will base its next generation of computers.
Another sign of Apple's strategy shift is expected today when it is due to
announce a product, code-named Houdini, that enables the Macintosh to run
applications programs designed for the Microsoft Windows operating system.
