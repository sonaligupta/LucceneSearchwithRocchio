FT  19 MAY 92 / Liberty running again


   By BETHAN HUTTON


Older generation: the Liberty watermill on the river Wandle in south London
started generating electricity for the first time for 50 years at the
weekend, Bethan Hutton writes.
Platform, an arts and ecology group, refitted the mill at Merton, which was
originally used by a factory making Liberty fabrics, to supply power for an
exhibition on London's historic water resources. The mill can generate 650
watts, but only a quarter of that is used by the exhibition.
The mill has been reopened as part of the Still Waters project, a series of
arts events and installations being held this month which aims to remind
Londoners of the capital's small rivers, now mostly heavily polluted or
hidden underground.
As part of its long-term goal of making London an ecologically sustainable
city, Platform is also working with the National Rivers Authority and the
Intermediate Technology Development Group to install a micro-hydro turbine
at the mouth of the Wandle. The turbine would be a demonstration project
that would generate up to 1,000 watts to help light a local school or health
clinic.
