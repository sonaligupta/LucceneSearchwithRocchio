FT  22 DEC 92 / Disparity in school results to be probed


   By ANDREW ADONIS


THE GOVERNMENT is to investigate 'unacceptable' differences in the
performance of local education authorities in this year's tests for
seven-year-olds in England.
The results, published yesterday, show that three quarters of
seven-year-olds achieved level 2 or above, the grade expected of their age
group in English, maths and science.
Results of the first pilot tests for 14-year-olds, also published yesterday,
showed barely a third at or above the standard expected of them, with the
proportion far lower in science.
Seven-year-olds achieved better results than last year across the
curriculum. In all, 76 per cent reached level 2 in reading, up 5 per cent.
That leaves nearly a quarter of seven-year-olds falling short of the reading
targets, and the proportion making the grade in writing fell 12 percentage
points to 66 per cent.
As last year, the differences between local education authorities are stark.
More than 20 percentage points separate the best-performing authorities from
the worst at level 2 in English, reading and technology.
Mr John Patten, education secretary, said: 'There continue to be
unacceptable variations in attainments between different local education
authorities. I will be investigating the reasons why some inner-city LEAs -
for example North Tyneside, Doncaster and Haringey - achieved results at or
above the national average while others in similar circumstances failed
badly.'
The Department for Education published average spending figures for
seven-year-olds in each LEA. Spending ranged from Pounds 2,110 a child a
year in Westminster to Pounds 1,120 in Kent. The top spenders were
inner-London authorities, which say social handicaps force them to spend
more.
Mr Patten said his inquiry would embrace spending. 'I will consider all the
factors, including the level of surplus places - which can often point to
poor management - in the LEAs to see what conclusions can be drawn,' he
said.
The results of the pilot tests for 14-year-olds held last summer showed that
only 34 per cent reached or surpassed the targets in mathematics, with 15
per cent doing so in science.
Four fifths of schools took part, but the Education Department played down
the significance of the results.
Mr Keith Legg, education chairman at Cleveland, the worst-performing LEA in
the tests of seven-year-olds, pointed to the effects of 14 per cent
unemployment and a 50 per cent rise in pupils qualifying for free school
meals in the area. He cited the authority's high standards at A-level in an
attempt to cast doubt on the reliability of the results.
The Assistant Masters and Mistresses Association condemned the results as a
'misleading exercise'. More than 13,000 applications have been received by
the Office for Standards in Education from people wishing to become
independent inspectors of schools. Ofsted, which succeeds Her Majesty's
Inspectorate, aims to have several hundred schools inspectors approved by
summer 1993.
