FT  29 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Fitch shares suspended as refinancing talks
begin


   By PEGGY HOLLINGER


SHARES IN Fitch, the loss-making design consultant which expanded rapidly in
the image conscious 1980s, were suspended at 41p yesterday as the group
announced it was in talks with its bankers on a refinancing.
The company, which in April reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 417,000 for
1991, said its shares had been temporarily suspended 'pending clarification
of the company's financial position'.
Mr Rodney Fitch, chairman, said the group was not in breach of its banking
convenants. Fitch hoped to make an announcement about a capital
restructuring within the next few weeks, he added.
A possible deal would include a capital injection from a third party, which
was not a financial institution. The final form of a refinancing and the
amount of cash injected depended on how the company's two London properties
were treated, he said.
Fitch carries some Pounds 7.5m of debt and gearing of about 260 per cent,
largely due to the move to its King's Cross headquarters. The building cost
Pounds 13.6m to build, but is valued in Fitch's books at just Pounds 6.75m.
The company has also had difficulty in shedding its former base in Soho,
which remained largely unlet, said Mr Fitch. A capital injection could come
in exchange for the sale of a building, while another possibility was a
debt-for-equity swap.
Mr Fitch said the refinancing had been an 'internally generated
reconstruction' to deal with the dual pressures of the economic downturn and
the properties' drain on resources.
'We are talking about a financial restructuring,' he said. 'We are not
talking about a reconstruction of Fitch.' The chairman said that business
remained difficult. It was not likely that the company would resume dividend
payments in the immediate future, he added.
