FT  02 NOV 93 / National print talks may resume


NATIONAL negotiations in the printing industry look set to return next year
after being suspended this year. The GPMU print union said last night that
talks with the British Printing Industries Federation had 'proved positive'.
The union added: 'Whilst a number of difficulties still remain, both the
GPMU and BPIF representatives believe that there are sufficient grounds to
commence national negotiations in 1994.'
A report on the informal negotiations will be made to both the GPMU's
executive council and the BPIF national board of management on November 17.
Another announcement is expected after that meeting.
The union has threatened to withdraw from all its national agreements with
printing employers if industry-wide bargaining is scrapped.
