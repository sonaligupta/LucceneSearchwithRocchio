FT  27 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Reuters finds US support


   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and PETER JOHN


ENTHUSIASTIC support for Reuters Holdings from the US led to a sharp rise in
the share price of the news and electronic dealing group. There was added
support ahead of a key foreign exchange dealers' meeting next week.
The UK market learned yesterday afternoon that Goldman Sachs had repeated
its strong buy recommendation. New York-based Mr Eric Philo said the company
had confirmed that its core foreign exchange business was improving and its
new Dealing 2000-2 automated trading system was close to achieving 1,000
trades a day. Mr Philo predicts earnings per share of up to 88.2p and a
share price as high as Pounds 17 within the next 12 months.
Also, dealers throughout the world are to meet in Helsinki next Thursday for
an annual foreign exchange meeting expected to be bullish for Reuters. The
shares, reacting to the US-quoted ADRs, jumped 44 to 1352p with 1.1m traded.
