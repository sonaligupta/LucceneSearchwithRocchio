FT  21 DEC 92 / International Company News: CU decides to cut pay-outs on
with-profit life policies


   By JOHN AUTHERS


COMMERCIAL Union, the composite insurer, is to cut pay-outs on with-profit
life policies.
However, it will maintain annual bonuses on the policies, in a move which
goes against the declared intentions of many of its rivals.
Actuaries for several large life insurers, including Standard Life and
Norwich Union, had made it clear that cuts in annual or reversionary
bonuses, which are declared each year and then cannot be taken away, could
be necessary this year.
This follows several years of indifferent investment returns compared to
those achieved in the mid-1980s.
But CU, the first life office to announce its bonuses for 1993, may have
damaged what appeared to be a comfortable industry consensus. This should
allow it to maintain a high position in competitive league tables of
with-profits performance, which is vital for distributing through
independent brokers.
However, CU has also cut the amount it pays in 'terminal bonus' which is
added at the end of a policy. This means that total pay-outs on a typical
policy will drop by around 4 per cent - still less than some observers have
predicted.
It is also cutting the interim reversionary bonus, appliable for those who
die during the next year, from 5 per cent of the underlying sum assured to
4.5 per cent.
The company admits that this indicates that bonuses can be expected to fall
next year.
CU says that it may be drawing slightly on the reserves of its life fund to
pay the bonus.
