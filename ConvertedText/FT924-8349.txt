FT  11 NOV 92 / International Company News: Thai Airways makes bold profit
forecast


   By VICTOR MALLET

THAI Airways International, the national airline partially privatised this
year, has predicted its net profits will nearly double to Bt5.71bn (Dollars
224m) in the year to September 30 1993, from Bt3.02bn last year.
Some stockbrokers said yesterday's forecast was optimistic but added the
company could be including planned aircraft sales in the figures, as it has
in the past. Thai is expected to release further details to the stock
exchange of Thailand next week.
The company predicted total revenues would rise in the current year to
Bt64.44bn, from Bt55.03bn.
This month the new civilian-controlled board of Thai has announced further
changes in senior management, demoting military men associated with the old
regime of the Thai air force.
If Thai's profit forecast is accurate, the company's prospective
price/earnings ratio falls to around 14, making its shares more attractive
to foreign buyers, who have concentrated on the cheaper shares of other
regional airlines.
'No-one really knows how to forecast this monster,' said one stock analyst
yesterday, 'but there's a lot of built-in growth in this company if they
start cutting costs.'
