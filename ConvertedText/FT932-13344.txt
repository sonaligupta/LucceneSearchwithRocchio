FT  23 APR 93 / International Company News: Roche sales maintain rate of
growth


   By IAN RODGER


   ZURICH


ROCHE, the Swiss pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals group, said sales in the
first quarter were up 7 per cent to SFr3.5bn (Dollars 2.39bn), almost in
line with the growth level in the second half of last year.
Mr Fritz Gerber, chairman, said the result indicated that 'barring
exceptional developments, 1993 will be another successful year for the
group'.
Speaking at the group's annual press conference in Basle, Mr Gerber said
Roche's 29 per cent rise in net income last year to SFr1.9bn was helped by
improved control of operating costs, which rose only 8.7 per cent.
Income from the group's SFr12.1bn liquid assets soared 51 per cent last year
to SFr1.3bn. Net financial income was SFr663m, accounting for a little over
one-third of total net income.
Roche does not yet provide a sectoral breakdown of profits, but officials
indicated that the diagnostics division, which has been a chronic lossmaker,
broke even, and the vitamins and fine chemicals division improved its
performance.
Mr Gerber said German healthcare reforms had caused a 20 per cent slump in
the country's pharmaceutical market in the first quarter, but said Roche's
share of that market fell only 10 per cent.
In the first quarter of this year, pharmaceutical sales rose 10 per cent to
SFr1.9bn while sales of the vitamins and fine chemical division gained only
3 per cent to SFr795m. Diagnostic sales were up 7 per cent to SFr418m and
fragrances and flavours sales up 2 per cent to SFr372m.
Swiss Bank Corporation, Switzerland's second-largest bank, said it had a
'thoroughly pleasing result' in the first quarter.
'The results of both the parent and the group were substantially above the
previous year's pre-tax result,' it said. No figures were given.
