FT  12 MAR 92 / Experts to study drought in southern Africa


   By AP


   WASHINGTON


TEAMS OF US and inter-national experts are being sent to southern Africa to
assess the impact on food supplies of what in some areas is the worst
drought of the century. Officials said millions of people will be affected,
AP reports from Washington.
Among the hardest hit of the 10 drought-stricken countries are Zimbabwe and
South Africa, traditional food exporters which this year will have to import
substantial quantities of grain. As the drought persists, estimates of the
grain harvest throughout the region have been falling precipitously.
The deteriorating situation in southern Africa adds a new dimension to the
continent's overall food crisis. The north-east is the most deprived area in
Africa, encompassing Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia and Djibouti. The lives of 15m
people are thought to be at risk.
Officials in Zimbabwe said last week 60,000 cattle died from starvation
during February alone and thousands more will die unless heavy rains come
soon.
The Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organisation warned late last month that
the drought could lead to widespread famine. About 98m people live in the
affected regions in southern Africa.
'Considerable donor assistance will be needed to avert a major humanitarian
crisis in the region,' the US State Department said last week.
