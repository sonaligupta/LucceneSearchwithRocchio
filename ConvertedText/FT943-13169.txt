FT  21 JUL 94 / International Company News: MCI Communications income ahead
43% in second quarter


   By MARTIN DICKSON


   NEW YORK


MCI Communications, the second largest US long distance telecommunications
company, yesterday reported a 43 per cent increase in second quarter net
income, helped by growth in the consumer, business and global markets.
MCI, in which British Telecommunications will buy a 20 per cent stake when
regulators have approved the purchase, reported net income of Dollars 215m,
or 37 cents a share, compared with Dollars 150m, or 27 cents, in the same
period of last year.
The 1993 figures included a charge of Dollars 28m, or 5 cents a share, for
the early retirement of debt.
Revenues totalled Dollars 3.31bn, up 13 per cent on the second quarter of
last year, while year-on-year traffic grew 14.4 per cent, substantially
higher than the industry average.
The figures were slightly ahead of the consensus Wall Street forecast, which
was pitched around 36 cents a share.
They confirmed both the strong growth of the long-distance market amid US
economic recovery, and MCI's above-average momentum, due to strong marketing
and innovative products.
Sprint, the third largest long distance carrier, also reported good results
on Tuesday, with its long-distance unit reporting a 30 per cent increase in
operating income, to Dollars 158m.
Mr Gerald Taylor, MCI president, said the company continued to gain new
customers across the board.
He added that other factors behind the leap in profits were its ability to
capitalise on early opportunities in select markets and deliver services
faster and more cost-efficiently.
For the six months, the group reported net income of Dollars 424m, or 73
cents a share, compared with Dollars 301m, or 55 cents, in the first half of
1993.
