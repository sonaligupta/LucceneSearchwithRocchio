FT  30 APR 94 / The Lex Column: European chemicals


First quarter figures this week from four of Europe's chemicals giants -
including ICI - reinforce the impression that the cycle has turned. That
will be comforting for the investors who chased the sector higher. Bayer,
BASF and Hoechst have outpaced the German market by 10 per cent this year,
matching the share price performance of ICI. But while all four companies
reported higher volume sales, bulk chemicals prices remain stubbornly low.
Until that changes the big gains in profitability will have to be postponed.
The current recession has been unusual in that chemicals prices collapsed -
often by more than half from the peak of the late 1980s - even though demand
remained respectable. Companies' eagerness to defend market share and the
generally low inflation environment may be to blame. The worry is that the
same factors could keep prices low. Chemicals prices have barely budged in
the US despite two years of rising volumes and capacity utilisation rates
which are in many cases over 90 per cent.
Since bulk chemicals are increasingly traded between continents, low prices
in Europe may be to blame. But without some pick-up soon, companies could be
squeezed. First quarter profits were helped by low oil prices, which kept
input prices down and widened margins. If the oil price turns before
petrochemicals markets are ready, companies may face a double-dip in profits
rather than a steady improvement.
