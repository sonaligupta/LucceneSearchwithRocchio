FT  12 MAR 92 / Conveyancing proposals dropped


PLANS TO allow banks and building societies to carry out conveyancing for
home buyers have been shelved, Lord Mackay, the lord chancellor, said
yesterday. Lord Mackay said there was insufficient demand from lenders to
enter the conveyancing market.
The 1990 Courts and Legal Services Act made provision for the creation of a
new class of conveyancers to be known as authorised practitioners.
