FT  06 JUN 92 / Fifth council properties in Southwark illegally occupied


   By IVOR OWEN


UP TO a fifth of council properties owned by the Labour-controlled London
borough of Southwark are illegally occupied, Mr Tony Baldry, junior
environment minister, told the Commons yesterday, Ivor Owen writes.
He said it was a 'matter for concern' that 11,000 of the 55,000 properties
were illegally occupied when there were 15,000 people on the housing waiting
list.
Mr Baldry clashed with Mr John Fraser, MP for Norwood and a former Labour
minister, who said that when rent was paid by a person whose name was not
that on the rent book it could not be described as 'squatting'.
The minister interpreted Mr Fraser's view as meaning 'if the caretaker is
flogging off keys, providing you are paying rent, it's OK'. Mr Fraser
accused the minister of misrepresenting him.
Mr Baldry confirmed that legislation would be introduced in the autumn,
providing a 'lower-risk route' to owner occupation for council tenants
through a rent-to-mortgages scheme.
Mr Clive Soley, a Labour housing spokesman, attacked the minister for using
Southwark and other Labour councils as 'scapegoats' for the government's
failure to provide affordable housing for the growing number of homeless.
