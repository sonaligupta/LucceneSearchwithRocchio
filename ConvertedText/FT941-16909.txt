FT  07 JAN 94 / Businesses attack sick-pay bill


The Federation of Small Businesses says it plans to take legal advice over
the government's move to increase the statutory sick-pay burden on
companies.
The 58,000-member federation says the measure could force some companies
already suffering cashflow problems out of business.
The measures to be introduced in the Statutory Sick Pay bill, which has its
second reading debated in the House of Lords next Tuesday, will require
companies to fund all sick pay for the first four weeks of sickness. After
that companies with National Insurance bills of less than Pounds 20,000 will
have 100 per cent of sick pay refunded.
