FT  12 MAR 93 / World Trade News: EC penalises bicycle imports


   By ANDREW HILL


   BRUSSELS


THE EUROPEAN Commission has taken action to protect Community bicycle-makers
from 'unfair' Chinese competition.
Chinese bicycle-makers - in terms of market penetration, probably the most
successful vehicle manufacturers in the world - have allegedly been
'dumping' bicycles on the EC market at unfairly low prices.
The Commission yesterday agreed to impose provisional anti-dumping duties on
Chinese bicycles imported into the Community. The duties will be set at 34.4
per cent of the net price before customs clearance.
Manufacturers from France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and Britain
complained in 1991 that they were not increasing sales in the growing
Community market because Chinese imports were undercutting EC products by an
average of 44 per cent.
Between 1989 and 1991, annual EC bicycle purchases increased 32 per cent to
19.9m, but Community manufacturers' share of the Ecu3bn (Pounds 2.47bn)
market dropped from 33 per cent to 27 per cent.
Meanwhile, imports of Chinese bicycles - from 'sit-up-and-beg' tourers to
racers and mountain bikes - more than tripled, from 693,600 to 2.1m. Chinese
manufacturers' market share rose from 4.6 per cent to 10.5 per cent.
'The pressure from Chinese exporters on the price of bicycles sold in the
Community has eroded EC industry's profitability and undermined its
investments,' said the Commission yesterday.
It has decided not to take any action against imports of bicycles from
Taiwan, after a parallel inquiry discovered that the dumping margin was
negligible.
