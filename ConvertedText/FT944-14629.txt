FT  21 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Fisons active


   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN and JEFFREY BROWN


Troubled pharmaceuticals group Fisons moved forward 3 to 116p as the
presence of some very large trades sharp-ened the perennial bid
spec-ulation.
A block of 9.2m shares dealt last week but, because of rules governing
unusually large deals, only announced yesterday, contributed to total
turnover of 15m, the highest since December last year.
Subsequently it was announced that Capital Group, the US investment fund
which held 6.1 per cent of the company, had reduced its stake to 5.84 per
cent. But that sale only represented some 2m shares.
