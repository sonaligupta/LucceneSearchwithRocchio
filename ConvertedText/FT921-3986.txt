FT  11 MAR 92 / International Company News: MGM battle takes another turn


   By ALAN FRIEDMAN


THE battle for control of MGM, the Hollywood studio, took yet another turn
yesterday when a Delaware court confirmed in a ruling that Credit Lyonnais,
the French state bank, had acted properly to remove Mr Giancarlo Parretti,
the Italian financier, from the board of the financially-crippled MGM.
Credit Lyonnais also dismissed as irrelevant a claim by Mr Parretti last
weekend that a Rome judge had ordered the sequester of a controlling
shareholding of MGM.
Mr Parretti fell out with Credit Lyonnais last year after it emerged that
the French bank had secretly provided about Dollars 1bn of loans to back his
MGM takeover in 1990.
Last weekend, he claimed that a Rome judge had named the brother of Mr
Gianni De Michelis, Italy's Socialist foreign minister, as the new chairman
of MGM. Mr Parretti argued that the Rome court had jurisdiction over MGM,
but Credit Lyonnais yesterday said the actions taken in Italy 'should have
no effect on the direction, management or operation' of MGM, which is
incorporated in Delaware, not Italy.
'Mr Parretti's actions in Italy are a blatant effort to mislead the Italian
courts. His attempt to find a forum which will decide in his favour
constitutes no more than an unfortunate international public relations
game,' the bank said.
Credit Lyonnais in New York claimed Mr Parretti had consented to the entry
of the final Delaware court judgment against him, thereby conceding that he
had been properly removed from the MGM board.
