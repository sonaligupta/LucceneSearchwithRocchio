FT  23 JUL 93 / Fishermen gain legal review of sea days


   By ALISON MAITLAND


FISHERMEN yesterday won the right to a judicial review of government plans
to limit the number of days they can spend at sea each year, Alison Maitland
writes.
The National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations, which says the
legislation would be disastrous for the industry, was given leave to apply
to the High Court for suspension of the rules due to take effect in January.
The hearing is likely to take place in October. Mr David Vaughan QC, counsel
for the federation, which represents 6,000 fishermen in England, Wales,
Northern Ireland and the Channel Islands, said that the measures hit UK
fishermen disproportionately because no similar system was proposed by any
other European Community member state.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food told the judge the
fishermen's challenge was 'unfounded' in law.
