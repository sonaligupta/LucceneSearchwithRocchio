FT  22 JUL 93 / International Capital Markets: Setback for CBOT as deal
falls through


   By LAURIE MORSE


A YEAR-LONG negotiation by the Chicago Board of Trade to acquire a New-York
based government securities dealing house has fallen through, halting the
exchange's plans to enter the cash government bond dealing business, writes
Laurie Morse.
Last July the CBOT agreed to acquire EJV Brokerage, an electronic broker
owned jointly by affiliates of six New York banks and brokerage houses. The
CBOT is the world's largest futures exchange, and trades futures and options
on US government bonds and notes.
The EJV acquisition has languished in Washington for over nine months under
Securities and Exchange Commission consideration. The CBOT said that rising
costs due to the delay in receiving regulatory approval forced EJV to
withdraw from the deal.
