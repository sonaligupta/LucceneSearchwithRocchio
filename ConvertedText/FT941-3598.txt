FT  15 MAR 94 / FT Review of Business Books (3): The old virtues count -
Aspects of Japan

Japanese Business Etiquette
by Diana Rowland
Warner Books, Pounds 5.99
354 pages
There is something deeply annoying about books on Japanese business
etiquette.
It is not that they do not deliver important and useful information. Diana
Rowland gives us a great deal, about post office opening times and seating
positions at meetings, etiquette at public baths and how to eat sushi.
Nor is it that many such books do not ring true. Diana Rowland's
descriptions of the acute embarassment which non-Japanese can cause by, for
instance, adopting too direct an approach to an initial meeting with a
company or making a show of paying for a meal, ring true.
No, the annoying thing is that many books obfuscate as they clarify. By
turning Japan into the sort of place where people need special guides and
inside knowledge, they make it seem a lot more intimidating than it really
is.
The truth, as Rowland points out, is that etiquette is a small part of what
brings success. What count are either traditional virtues, which hold good
anywhere; or special qualities, such as being an insider within a web of
Japanese relationships - which is beyond the grasp of most foreigners.
Nevertheless, as these guides go, Diana Rowland's is readable, practical,
useful and accurate.
