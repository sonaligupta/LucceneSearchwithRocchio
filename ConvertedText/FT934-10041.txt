FT  08 NOV 93 / Sunday workers' rights undecided


   By JAMES BLITZ and CHRIS TIGHE


MINISTERS yesterday scotched speculation that the government had decided to
include a right not to work on Sundays in its plans for Sunday shopping
legislation.
The government is planning to introduce a bill legalising Sunday shopping in
the Queen's Speech later this month. Ministers yesterday said that they had
not yet decided whether to include guarantees ofshop workers' rights.
An official said yesterday: 'It is not strictly true that the government has
changed its mind of this. The government is still looking at the whole bill
and taking views from all the interested parties.'
A week-long campaign to enlist public support for the partial deregulation
of Sunday shopping, coupled with statutory protection of workers' rights, is
launched today by the General Municipal Boilermakers Union in the north of
England. The union nationally has more than 30,000 shop-worker members,
almost all of them employees of superstore operator Asda.
