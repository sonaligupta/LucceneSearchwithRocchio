FT  07 MAR 94 / R-R moves to calm customers after fire


   By CHRIS TIGHE


Rolls-Royce will today be contacting customers of International Research and
Development, part of its nuclear engineering division, to reassure them in
the wake of a severe fire which destroyed part of IRD's Newcastle premises
at the weekend.
IRD carries out materials testing and other research. Half its work is for
outside clients including Nuclear Electric, the Ministry of Defence,
National Power and PowerGen.
Eighty fire fighters tackled the blaze, which broke out shortly before
midnight on Friday. Nobody was injured but it wrecked one wing of the
L-shaped building, destroying laboratories and melting computers.
Managers from Rolls-Royce's Tyneside-based Industrial Power Group, of which
IRD is a part, spent the weekend planning how to minimise disruption to the
research projects.
IRD's 170 scientists and engineers have been asked to report for work as
normal this morning; some may be accommodated temporarily elsewhere within
Industrial Power Group premises. The company hopes work may resume soon in
IRD's undamaged wing.
The cost of the damage is not yet known. Nobody was working in the building
when the fire broke out, but a guard was patrolling the site.
The cause is being investigated by Northumbria police and the Tyne and Wear
fire brigade. Police said yesterday that they had not 'heard any suggestions
of anything malicious'.
