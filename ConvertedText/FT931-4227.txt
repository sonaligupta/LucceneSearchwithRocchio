FT  11 MAR 93 / International Company News: Currency loss helps push SAS
into the red for third consecutive year


   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES and AGENCIES


SCANDINAVIAN Airlines System (SAS) yesterday reported a SKr743m (Dollars
97.4m) pre-tax loss for 1992, its third consecutive year in the red, and
said it expected another difficult year in 1993.
The airline's chief executive, Mr Jan Carlzon, told a news conference that
SAS would have to team with another European airline in order to survive,
although he described the 1992 results as 'a fair result in a tough sector'.
'We think in the future we will . . . keep our heads above water, but we
need to get into the big five in Europe and to make large structural changes
by 1995,' Mr Carlzon said.
The deficit had been expected after the airline revealed in January that its
result would be hit by a one-off SKr1.2bn currency loss as a result of the
devaluation of the krona.
SAS expected 'some improvement' in its pre-tax result this year, although it
foresaw 'continued slow market growth with mounting pressures from increased
competition and lower fares.'
The airline is currently discussing extensive strategic collaboration
arrangements with KLM, Swissair and Austrian Airlines.
SAS said its operating result rose SKr213m to SKr2.93bn as revenues
increased 7 per cent to SKr34.4bn in spite of difficult market conditions.
It increased market share in many European countries, with sales rising
SKr986m to SKr22.7bn. However, SAS noted that many important markets, and
Sweden in particular, were still in recession and its traffic growth of 2
per cent was far below the European average of 13 per cent.
The group suffered from lower fares, caused by intense competition and the
deregulation of the Swedish market.
However, falling yields within SAS, SAS International Hotels and SAS Leisure
were offset by the group's extensive rationalisation programme. The airline
plans to cut operating costs by a further 20 to 25 per cent over the next
three years.
SAS airline saw profits before extraordinary items fall to SKr25m last year
from SKr1.04bn in 1991, but the group's hotel operations posted much reduced
losses of SKr135m, compared with SKr1.02bn.
