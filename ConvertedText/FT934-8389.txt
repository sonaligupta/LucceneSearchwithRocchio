FT  16 NOV 93 / People: Whitbread rings the changes


Whitbread, the brewing and retail group, is to make a series of senior
management changes in its public house operations following the retirement
next February of Len Oliver, managing director of Whitbread Pub Partnerships
for the past three years.
Oliver was previously managing director of Thresher and has been with the
company for 19 years.
Oliver, 53, who joined Whitbread in 1976 after 20 years with J Lyons, was
largely responsible for the reorganisation of Whitbread's leased pub estate
to meet the requirements of government legislation. That restructuring
followed on the heels of a report from the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission, an inquiry into the brewing industry.
Oliver is to be succeeded by Bill Shannon, 44, who is at present managing
director of the group's Beefeater restaurants and pubs, and former managing
director of Thresher, the off-licence chain. Shannon, right, will join the
group's executive committee on December 1.
Simon Wood, commercial director of Whitbread Inns, the managed pub estate,
will take over as managing director of Beefeater.
Wood joined Whitbread Inns in 1990 from Chef & Brewer, where he had been
managing director.
Stewart Miller, 40, operations director of Beefeater will become sales and
marketing director of Whitbread Inns.
He will be replaced by Ian Webster, 39, currently director and general
manager of Sherwood Inns in Sheffield, where he is responsible for more than
280 managed pubs.
David Livingstone, 48, operations director of Whitbread Inns, takes up a new
post of business development director, and will concentrate on the
division's expansion plans.
All the management changes are due to be in place by the start of
Whitbread's financial year on March 1 1994.
Peter Jarvis, chief executive, said: 'Each of the new appointments is
designed to bring fresh impetus to the growth plans of the operating
companies concerned. We are fortunate in having management strength in depth
to make such a series of changes from within the company's own resources.'
