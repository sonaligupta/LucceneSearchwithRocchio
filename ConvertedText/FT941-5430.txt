FT  07 MAR 94 / Fewer payments made by cheque


   By ALISON SMITH


The use of cheques is declining in favour of plastic cards and direct
debits, according to research conducted for Girobank, the banking subsidiary
of Alliance & Leicester building society which runs a money transmission
service.
The survey, which compares results obtained in December with findings from a
year before, also highlighted a continuing attachment to cash.
In both surveys, more than 60 per cent said they expected to be using cash
as often in five years as now.
In 1993, 52 per cent of adults with a current account used direct debits
compared with 46 per cent in 1992; and 26 per cent used debit cards,
compared with 19 per cent in 1992.
About three-quarters of those questioned had use of a bank or building
society current account.
For buying goods worth about Pounds 10, using a cheque was the first-choice
method of payment for 5 per cent in 1993, compared with 8 per cent in 1992.
Preference for a card for such purchases rose from 8 per cent to 11 per
cent.
Similarly in 1993 those expressing a preference for paying household bills
by cheque had fallen from 35 per cent to 28 per cent, while the proportion
preferring to pay by direct debit rose from 42 per cent to almost half.
The survey's findings on the use of cash may make bleak reading for banks:
the cost to banks of cash transmission in the clearing system has been
estimated by the Association for Payment Clearing Services at Pounds 2bn a
year.
The cost of using cheques in 1991 was put at Pounds 1.5bn, but even if the
number of cheques continues to fall, the infrastructure to handle them will
still be needed and unit costs will rise.
RSGB, part of market research group Taylor Nelson AGB, carried out the
survey in December 1992 and 1993, each time questioning about 2,000 adults.
