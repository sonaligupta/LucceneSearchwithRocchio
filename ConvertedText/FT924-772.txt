FT  22 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Ultimatum for ITV companies


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


THE ITV companies have been given 48 hours to sign a news supply agreement
with Independent Television News for the five years from January 1.
After nearly a year of negotiation they have been warned that there may be
no news unless the agreement is signed.
The ITN board yesterday approved an agreement, after it is believed, the
Independent Television Commission expressed concern at the delays.
Mr Andrew Quinn, the chief executive of the ITV Association was also
involved in trying to smooth the path to a deal.
The original plan was for an agreement that would start at Pounds 57m next
year falling to Pounds 50m by year five - an average of Pounds 53.6m
including an allowance for cost of money.
The new deal is for a flat Pounds 53.6m a year which will increase in line
with retail prices.
Provision for a review after two years in the event of significant changes
in the cost structure of ITN is also part of the deal - a provision backed
by Yorkshire Television.
The restructuring of ITN with control passing to six companies led by Mr
Michael Green's Carlton Communications is conditional on the acceptance of
ITN's news supply agreement.
