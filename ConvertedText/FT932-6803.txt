FT  27 MAY 93 / Republics in bid for more tax revenues


   By LEYLA BOULTON

THE LEADERS of the Russian Federation's constituent republics will use their
support for President Boris Yeltsin's proposed new constitution as a
bargaining chip to secure greater access to tax revenues and export
earnings, it emerged yesterday.
Mr Yeltsin told a meeting of republican chiefs yesterday that the new
constitution would limit the powers of the centre, giving republics more
rights but also more responsibilities. His spokesman said republican leaders
had signed up to a gentleman's agreement not to alter significantly the
president's constitutional draft.
In a related move the 21 republics - Chechnya was the only one to stay away
 -plan to meet next month to agree measures to implement a new federation
treaty in parallel to a constitutional convention, which opens on June 5 to
adopt the new constitution.
Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, first deputy prime minister, said the president would
soon publish a decree on ways of implementing the federal treaty, including
details of revenue sharing responsibilities between the regions and the
centre. The treaty was signed last year but Russia's 89 republics and
regions have complained that it has not been implemented.
A federation treaty is badly needed to give the state a more orderly
structure, but part of the problem in implementing it has been very
different concepts of what would constitute a fair division of power and
wealth with Moscow.
Mr Yeltsin will have to balance the interests of poorer regions which need
central government subsidies, while retaining enough control over economic
policy to push through reforms.
