FT  15 APR 94 / Working party formed at Swans


   By CHRIS TIGHE


The Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions and Price
Waterhouse - receivers to the Tyneside shipbuilder Swan Hunter - agreed
yesterday to set up a joint working party to consider the company's imminent
problem of reducing its workforce to match its dwind-ling workload, Chris
Tighe writes.
Of the remaining 1,038 employees, 490 are at risk of losing their jobs next
month when Swan Hunter hands over the Type 23 frigate HMS Northumberland,
leaving only one frigate in the yard.
The receivers have described the 1,038 as the 'golden nugget' of the
company, which they hope to sell as a going concern.
Already 1,400 employees have been made redundant since receivership last
May. The unions fear that any further redundancies would eat into the core
workforce essential to Swans' future as a going concern.
Price Waterhouse said the joint working party would consider the options
available to maintain the company's capability and the maximum number of
jobs.
