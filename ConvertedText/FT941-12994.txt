FT  27 JAN 94 / International Company News: Bayer lifts profits and sales
forecasts

Bayer, the German chemicals group, has up-graded its 1993 profits and sales
forecasts, consolidating expectations that it will pay an unchanged DM11
dividend for the year.
According to Mr Manfred Schneider, group chairman, a better-than-expected
fourth quarter and a lift from the strengthening dollar would bolster sales
to around DM41bn (Dollars 24.1bn), compared with DM41.2bn in 1992, and his
late-November forecast of DM40bn. Bayer calculates its results using
year-end exchange rates.
Pre-tax profits would perhaps be a bit better than the DM2.2bn expected
earlier, he said.
Mr Schneider repeated his forecast that the four-year decline in earnings
had ended. Bayer had reached the bottom of the trough, he said, although he
predicted unchanged earnings for the current financial year.
The VCI chemicals industry association, of which Bayer is a leading member,
last week said the worst was past, but there were no signs of a lasting
recovery.
Mr Schneider said Bayer intended to deal with the problems of low-capacity
utilisation by negotiating more co-operation deals with other manufacturers
in dyes, organic chemicals and plastics.
The group was running some plant at 50 per cent to 60 per cent of capacity,
he said.
He expected to conclude co-operation negotiations by the end of March aimed
at giving the company a foothold in the fast-growing US market for generic
drugs, but it would continue to focus most of its attention on its
established role as a supplier of branded pharmaceuticals.
Some 45 per cent of this year's DM3.3bn research and development budget
would be devoted to pharmaceuticals, over-the-counter and diagnostic
products. These divisions absorbed about 43 per cent of last year's DM3.2bn
budget.
