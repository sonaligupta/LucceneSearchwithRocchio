21m loss in third quarter

KAISER Aluminum of the US posted a net loss of Dollars 21m or 42 cents per
share in the third quarter. The company is the latest in a series of US
aluminium manufacturers reporting losses as a result of a worldwide
oversupply of the metal.
Kaiser said that historically low aluminium prices and weakness in prices
for rolled aluminium used to make aircraft bodies and beverage cans would
force a restructuring at its Trentwood plant in Spokane, Washington.
This would result in a fourth-quarter pre-tax charge against earnings of
between Dollars 30m and Dollars 40m.
Kaiser's third-quarter loss compares with income of Dollars 3.9m, or 6 cents
per share, in the same period a year ago. Third-quarter sales fell to
Dollars 428.4m from Dollars 458.5m a year earlier.
Kaiser's customer shipments of primary and fabricated aluminium fell to
148,200 metric tons in the third quarter, down from 164,700 tons in the
third quarter of 1992. Alumina shipments to customers advanced to 576,900 in
the quarter, from 469,300 last year.
For the first nine months of the year Kaiser, which is 68 per cent owned by
the natural resources company Maxxam, reported a loss or Dollars 57m, or
Dollars 1.05 per share, before extraordinary charges.
This compares with profits of Dollars 24.3m, or 42 cents per share for the
first nine months of 1992. Sales for the first nine months of the year were
Dollars 1.3bn, down from Dollars 1.4bn last time.
Maxxam reported a net loss of Dollars 33.3m or Dollars 3.42 for the third
quarter, compared with income of Dollars 7m or 7 cents in the third quarter
of 1992. Sales for the quarter were Dollars 506.5m, down from Dollars 531.7m
a year ago.
For the first nine months Maxxam reported a loss of Dollars 68.5m, or
Dollars 7.24 per share, excluding special charges, compared with income of
Dollars 3m or 32 cents a year earlier.
Alcan Aluminium, facing the deepest and longest post-war recession in ingot
and fabricated products prices, will become smaller and leaner, warns Mr
Jacques Bougie, president and now chief executive, writes Robert Gibbens in
Montreal.
Alcan's downstream businesses must 'demonstrate clear potential' if they are
to get further investment, Mr Bougie said in the company's internal
magazine.
Mr Bougie suggested that a new round of cuts will focus on Alcan affiliates
making end products. Those that do not measure up or lack a sound profitable
future will be sold.
