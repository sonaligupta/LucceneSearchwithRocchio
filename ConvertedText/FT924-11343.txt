FT  27 OCT 92 / Japanese warning on surplus


   By REUTER


   TOKYO


JAPAN'S trade surplus, which grew to a record in the first half of this
fiscal year, will remain high until demand for imports recovers strongly, a
government report said, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
The Economic Planning Agency (EPA) said the structure of Japanese exports
had changed from the early 1980s in a way that nearly guaranteed that their
value would remain at current high levels.
'In order to curb the trade surplus, we need to increase domestic demand,
which the government's economic package announced late August will help
stimulate,' Mr Shoichi Ojima, the EPA official in charge of the report, told
reporters.
