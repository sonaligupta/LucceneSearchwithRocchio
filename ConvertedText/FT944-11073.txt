FT  08 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Nice work share for those EU
commissioners


   From Mr ROGER SAOUL


Sir, The photograph of Jacques Santer, the EC president, and his
commissioners on your front page (October 31) reminded me of the scene at
the local Jobcentre which I have to visit every fortnight - too many people
chasing too few jobs.
It is comforting to know that the commissioners have the opportunity to work
share, and that their rates of remuneration are not affected.
