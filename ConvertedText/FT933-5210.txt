FT  04 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Dalgety expands via purchase of two Unigate
subsidiaries


   By DAVID BLACKWELL


DALGETY, the food and agriculture group, is buying two businesses from
Unigate, the food and distribution group which is still in the process of
reshaping its activities.
Dalgety is paying Pounds 15.7m cash for Oldacre, which has eight animal feed
mills, mainly in southern England. The business has assets of Pounds 10m and
made operating profits of Pounds 2m on sales of Pounds 78.5m in the year to
March 1993.
In addition, Dalgety is paying Pounds 9m for Morton Foods, which supplies
batter and crumb coatings to the food industry. It has net assets of Pounds
4m and last year made an operating profit of Pounds 330,000 on sales of
Pounds 7m.
Mr Richard Clothier, Dalgety chief executive, said yesterday that Oldacre
would lift Dalgety from 17 per cent to 21 per cent of the 10m-tonne UK
animal feed market, bringing it level with Harrison & Crosfield's BOCM
Pauls, the market leader.
Morton, which has a modern crumb plant in Oxfordshire, would bring
high-value capacity to Dalgety's existing range of food coatings, he said.
Mr John Worby, Unigate finance director, said the disposal of the two
companies fitted in with the group's plan to concentrate its business on the
core food and distribution areas.
Morton had been acquired in April along with Clifford Foods, a dairy and
juice company, and was being sold because Unigate had no other ingredient
businesses.
The sale of the two businesses, along with other recent disposals and
acquisitions, would leave Unigate with pro forma gearing in the low to
mid-30s, he said.
