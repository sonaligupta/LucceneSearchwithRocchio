FT  21 DEC 92 / Ukraine assures US on Start pact


   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND

THE Ukrainian government has given the US State Departmentassurances that
parliament will ratify the Start treaty on January 14 or 15 when the
legislature returns from its holiday break, officials said in Kiev over the
weekend.
The treaty, which was agreed by the US and the former Soviet Union, covers
reductions in strategic nuclear weapons.
Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus have already ratified the accord. Ukraine,
and the 176 intercontinental ballistic missiles on its territory, is the
last important hurdle to full ratification.
Kiev has made a commitment in principle to becoming a non-nuclear state and
has transferred its tactical nuclear weapons to Russia, where they are to be
dismantled.
The Ukrainian pledge follows intense pressure from Mr Lawrence Eagleburger,
the US secretary of state, who has warned Kiev that unless it ratifies the
treaty soon bilateral relations with the US could be threatened. Mr
Eagleburger said in Washington yesterday that the US was 'getting more than
a little bit perturbed' by the Ukrainian reluctance to live up to its early
promises to get rid of its nuclear weapons.
However, there are signs in Kiev that Mr Eagleburger's tough approach could
be counter-productive and that the Ukrainian government's pledge may not be
honoured.
The parliament has been voting with increasing independence lately,
suggesting that no Ukrainian leader is in a position to guarantee
parliamentary ratification of the treaty on any specific date.
