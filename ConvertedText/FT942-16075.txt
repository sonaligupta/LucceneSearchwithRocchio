FT  12 APR 94 / International Company News: VW fails to settle Skoda
differences with Czechs

Talks yesterday in Prague between Mr Ferdinand Piech, Volkswagen chairman,
and Mr Vladimir Dlouhy, the Czech minister for trade and industry, failed to
resolve differences between the two sides over the long-term future of Skoda
Automobilova, in which the German car maker has a 31 per cent stake.
The two partners - the Czech state still owns almost 70 per cent of Skoda -
have been at odds ever since VW, which was due to invest DM7.1bn over 10
years, said last autumn that it was sharply reducing investments to DM3.7bn
(Dollars 2.2bn) as part of its cost-saving drive.
Plans for a new engine plant at the Mlada Boleslav site were also ditched.
This angered the Czech government, which argued that as the main
shareholder, it should have been consulted about the changes.
In December, both sides agreed to differ, and Mr Piech promised to keep
Prague better informed.
A new protocol covering future investments by VW will be presented at a
shareholders' meeting on Friday.
