FT  16 JAN 92 / Pounds 8.3m placing at John Wood


JOHN WOOD Group, the Aberdeen-based oilfield services company which is one
of Scotland's largest privately-owned concerns, is broadening its
shareholder base by placing pounds 8.3m worth of convertible preference
shares with 13 institutions, most of them Scottish.
No cash is being raised for the company but the new shares will, on
conversion, account for 8.7 per cent of John Wood's equity. The proportion
of the company held by institutions will rise from 9.3 to 18 per cent, and
the stake held by the Wood family will fall to 73 per cent and that of
management and staff to 9 per cent.
Mr Ian Wood, chairman, said that the move was part of the evolution of John
Wood away from being a family concern.
