FT  23 NOV 92 / The ERM Alignment: Danes welcome currency moves


   By REUTER


   COPENHAGEN


DANISH Economy Minister Thor Pedersen welcomed the weekend's devaluation of
the Spanish and Portuguese currencies within the Exchange Rate Mechanism
(ERM) yesterday and said it would have little effect on Denmark, Reuter
reports from Copenhagen.
'The move will only have a marginal effect on the Danish economy, as only 3
per cent of our foreign trade involves these countries,' Mr Pedersen said.
'It is satisfactory that the devaluations were so small and that the
readjustments within ERM were so limited,' he said.
'This should prevent currency speculation. I welcome the ERM realignment as
it will bring calm to the EC currency situation.'
In Stockholm, Swedish central bank governor Bengt Dennis said the
devaluation of the two currencies would not have any great effect on Sweden.
'They are relatively small trading partners so it will not have any major
effects for Sweden,' Mr Dennis told the TT news agency.
Sweden said on Thursday it would float its crown against other currencies,
saying the fight against currency speculators had proved too hard.
'There is no doubt that our decision on a floating exchange rate contributed
to the devaluations. It released a very strong reaction in the European
currencies. Many currencies came under pressure then,' Mr Dennis said.
