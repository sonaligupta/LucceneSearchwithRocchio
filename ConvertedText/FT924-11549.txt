FT  24 OCT 92 / Food: Weekend wine bargains - Appetisers


   By NICHOLAS LANDER


THIS IS the weekend to buy bottles from this year's winner of the WINE
magazine Wine Merchant of the year title, Whitbread's Thresher/Wine
Rack/Bottoms Up group of wine shops. They are offering a full 20 per cent
off any 12 assorted bottles of wine or champagne, and 10 per cent off any
six bought this weekend. Take advantage with their best lines such as fine
Zind-Humbrecht Alsace whites, superior California Saintsbury Chardonnay and
Pinot Noir, cliche-defying Spanish white Albarino Lagar de Cervera and
Drappier champagne, which would come to Pounds 11.19 a bottle as part of a
mixed dozen. Jancis Robinson
Autumn is fast becoming the season of the international jet-setting chef.
Emile Jung, chef of the three-star Michelin restaurant Le Crocodile (tel:
88.32.13.02) in Strasbourg has just completed a two-week stint at Le
Souffle, the restaurant at the InterContinental, Hyde Park (071-409 3131)
and Michel Lorrain from the similarly rated A la Cote St-Jacques in Joigny
(86.62.09.70) has just been at Le Meridien on Piccadilly (071-734-8000) to
put the finishing touches to the menu on which he acts as consultant.
Hot on their heels comes Ken Hom to the Langham Hilton. He will be cooking
there from November 6-15 but, such is Hom's popularity, that those keen to
sample his individualistic style should book early on 071-636-1000. Nicholas

The phrase 'wine club' is often a euphemism for extra profit margin but the
BACUP Wine Club was set up specifically to generate funds for charity. The
British Association of Cancer United Patients provides support to cancer
sufferers and their families. a long-serving wine merchant so appreciated
BACUP's work during his illness that he instituted the BACUP wine Club,
selling 10 different but reliable wines delivered by the dozen in aid of the
celebrity sponsored charity. The prices are so reasonable that one almost
has to double check that cases contain 12 and not six bottles. Just Pounds
31.35 will secure you 12 bottles of Sir Dirk Bogarde's favourite, a 1990
Cotes-du-Rhone, while a 1986 claret from the Cotes de Bourg is Pounds 46.75
a dozen. Delivery is free for five cases or more; Pounds 7.50 for smaller
orders. For more information tel: 071-696-9003. JR.
At the newly-opened Ransome's Dock restaurant in Battersea, south London
(071-223-1611) there is a weekday set price lunch at Pounds 10.50 for three
courses. Its Sunday brunch menu includes smoked haddock kedgeree (Pounds
4.50), roast duck with apple sauce (Pounds 8.50), lambburgers, rocket salad
and chips for the children (Pounds 5.75) and treacle tart or baked apples
(Pounds 2.95) as puddings.
