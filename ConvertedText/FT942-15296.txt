FT  15 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Low oil prices should not
trigger energy crisis, says IEA chief

Current low oil prices should not lead to an energy crisis, despite concerns
that they could discourage oilfield development or create bitter feelings
among producer nations, the chief of the International Energy Agency said
here yesterday, reports Reuter from Kyoto.
Ms Helga Steeg, IEA executive director, in Japan to attend an IEA board
meeting, suggested that serious energy shortages could be averted if
consuming and producing countries created a co-operative environment.
She said the agency had held many talks with producer nations and oil
companies since the Gulf War to discuss the long-term outlook as well as the
investment climate, and: 'Oil companies have said prices are an important
element but not the only element (in deciding development projects)'.
Ms Steeg added that producing countries, most of which were still
economically in the development stage, needed western world funds and
technology and were interested in co-operating with consumer nations.
One IEA idea was to create a two-way investment flow, in which western oil
companies invested in upstream sectors in producing countries and producers
invested in downstream sectors - such as petrol stations - in consumer
nations, she explained.
That would enable the producing countries to 'see with their own eyes and
experience what the problems are.'
