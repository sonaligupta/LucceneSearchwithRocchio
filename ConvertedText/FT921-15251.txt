FT  11 JAN 92 / World Commodities Prices: Spices


Pepper started the new year with no improvement in the recent levels of
activity, reports Man-producten. There are hardly any developments in pepper
producing areas which might change this pattern. White pepper prices slowly
declined by lack of demand to a level of about USDollars 1,375 a tonne c&f.
On the contrary, black pepper prices were slightly steadier on increasing
demand and less selling pressure.
