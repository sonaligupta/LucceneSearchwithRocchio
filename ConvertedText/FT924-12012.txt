Economics ministers of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean)
today open a two-day meeting in Manila to formally adopt rules governing a
tariff reduction programme leading to the creation of an Asean free trade
area (Afta) in 15 years, Jose Galang writes from Manila.
The tariff cuts, covering 15 product groups, are to start in January 1993.
By the year 2003 maximum tariffs on these products should be 20 per cent,
and by 2008 0 to 5 per cent.
