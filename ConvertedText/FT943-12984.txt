FT  22 JUL 94 / Economic Watch: French trade surplus continues

France's external trading account continued to show a surplus during May of
FFr7.5bn (Pounds 900m), according to the latest statistics from French
customs. The May figure confirms the recent upward trend in the French
economy and brings France's total trading surplus to FFr30.6bn for the first
five months of 1994. This is in line with the government's forecasts for a
target surplus of FFr100bn for the whole year. The buoyant trading account
reflects a continuation of the strong export performance of French
companies. The level of exports rose to FFr107.4bn in May against FFr104bn
in April. However, import activity, which fell sharply last year when the
recession began, is now returning to normal levels. The value of imports
coming into France increased to FFr99.4m during May, its highest level since
November 1992.
Industrial production in the Netherlands rose 2.1 per cent in May from
April, on a seasonally adjusted basis, the government Central Bureau for
Statistics said yesterday. Seasonally adjusted industrial production was 2.6
per cent higher than in May 1993.
Italian consumer prices rose 0.2 per cent month on month and 3.5 per cent
year on year in July, according to unofficial data from nine leading Italian
cities excluding Rome, collated by the city of Bologna.
