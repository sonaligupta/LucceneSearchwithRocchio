FT  20 NOV 92 / International Company News: Renault earnings top FFr7.5bn

RENAULT, the French state-owned car group, yesterday reported more than
doubled pre-tax profits for the first three quarters of the year, in sharp
contrast to the situation at its Swedish partner, Volvo.
Renault made FFr7.51bn (Dollars 1.39bn) before tax in the nine months to
September, against FFr2.90bn in the same period of 1991, on turnover up by
10.7 per cent over the same period from FFr122.22bn to FFr135.26bn. The
profit comes after a FFr478m charge for Renault's share of Volvo's losses.
The French group attributed its improvement to gains in market share by the
car division, a steep fall in finance charges and reduced losses at Mack,
the US truck unit of Renault Vehicules Industriels (RVI). Cars represent
83.7 per cent of turnover and trucks 13.6 per cent.
However, Renault warned that the outlook was clouded by a fall in
registrations in some of its main export markets and a continuing decline in
demand for heavy trucks. RVI's operating loss in the third quarter was of
the same order as its FFr301m loss for the whole of the first half and the
truck division's outlook for the rest of the year was 'unfavourable', said
Renault. On top of this, the group will be taking the cost of the September
currency crisis in the current quarter.
Group profits in the second half would be well down on the first, though
full-year sales and net profits would still show a significant increase over
1991, said the group. Last year, Renault reported a FFr3.08bn net profit on
sales of FFr166bn.
Renault's turnover in the third quarter of this year reached FFr40.42bn, a
3.7 per cent rise on the FFr39.98bn of the same period in 1991. Pre-tax
profits in the three months to September reached FFr2.06bn, as against
FFr1.94bn.
