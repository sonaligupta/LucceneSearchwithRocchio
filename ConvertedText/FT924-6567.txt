FT  20 NOV 92 / International Company News: Dutch bank withdraws plans to
bid for BBL

INTERNATIONALE Nederlanden Groep (ING), the Dutch banking and insurance
group, has withdrawn plans to make a BFr63.6bn (Dollars 2.0bn) public bid
for Belgium's second largest bank, Banque Bruxelles Lambert (BBL), following
a disagreement between the two sides about the price per share to be
offered.
BBL said that ING had refused to confirm its earlier stated maximum price of
BFr3,600 per share. For this reason, BBL said it would not be recommending
the bid to shareholders, which it described as being a condition that both
sides had agreed must be fulfilled if the bid were to go ahead.
ING, which recently completed an examination of the Belgian bank's books,
confirmed that it would not be proceeding with the bid, blaming the
development on disagreements about the value of certain BBL assets.
The Dutch group said that it would have been difficult to win the bid at any
price lower than the maximum BFr3,600, because BBL shareholders had said
that they would not tender their shares at the original maximum price.
However, the Dutch company, which owns approximately 11 per cent of BBL,
that it would remain an important minority shareholder.
BBL said last night that a report which it recently commissioned from Credit
Suisse First Boston showed that the shares were worth substantially more
than BFr3,600.
BBL's shares were suspended yesterday on the Brussels stock exchange after
they fell BFr160 to BFr3,300 on speculation that the long-awaited bid would
not be launched after all.
ING had hoped to use BBL to create a second home market and to export its
'bancassurance' concept of combining banking and insurance to Belgium.
