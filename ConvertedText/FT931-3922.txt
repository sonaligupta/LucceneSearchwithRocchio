FT  13 MAR 93 / Conservatives move up, ecologists fall back in French poll

WITH a week to go before the first round of voting in France's parliamentary
election, the conservative coalition is still gaining ground over the ruling
Socialists in the polls.
The Socialists now command the support of 18 per cent of the electorate,
according to a BVA poll in today's Liberation newspaper. This leaves the
ruling party behind both centre-right parties.
The RPR is edging ahead of the UDF, with 20 per cent to 19 per cent.
Meanwhile the ecologists, who earlier in the campaign threatened to beat the
Socialists into second place, are now losing momentum. Support for the
ecologist alliance has slipped to 12 per cent from 14.5 per cent a month
ago.
The new poll suggests the RPR will emerge as the largest single force in the
National Assembly, with 228 seats, against 198 for the UDF. This should give
the RPR an advantage in the allocation of ministerial positions and possibly
influence President Francois Mitterrand in his choice of prime minister.
The president was yesterday embroiled in controversy over allegations by
Liberation newspaper that his security staff at the Elysee Palace had in the
mid-1980s made requests to bug the telephones of scores of prominent
figures, including the actress Ms Carole Bouquet and the writer Mr
Jean-Edern Hallier. Last week Liberation claimed that Elysee staff had
tapped the phone of Mr Edwy Plenel, an investigative journalist.
