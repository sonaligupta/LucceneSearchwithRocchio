FT  05 MAR 94 / Curbs on foreign banks may ease


   By JOHN LLOYD


Prospects for relaxation of the tight rules governing foreign banks in
Russia appear to have improved following talks with the authorities and
foreign bankers.
Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, yesterday told a meeting
of government ministers and party leaders: 'I think life will force us to
take a new approach towards competition with foreign banks. Hothouse
conditions do not seem good for our bankers.'
A decree issued last year permits a few foreign banks to operate under tight
restrictions; it limits foreign banks to handling accounts of non-residents
only - cutting out the growing Russian business and personal market as well
as joint ventures.
Foreign bankers believe their lobbying for a more liberal regime has been
paying off, and that Mr Chernomyrdin's remarks may herald more banks
entering the arena or existing banks taking a wider spread of clients.
The licences issued by the central bank to all but one of the banks allow
all types of transactions - but the decree tightly limits them.
Russian banks are small by international standards and offer a limited range
of services with an emphasis on money trading. They fear the unrestricted
entry of large western institutions would hit their market.
Moscow yesterday confirmed its intention to pull out troops from Estonia by
the agreed date of August 31 - but only if a dispute over the fate of 10,000
Russian military veterans were settled to its satisfaction. Estonia has so
far been determined not to pay social security to the army pensioners. It
claims most of them are not - as Moscow says - elderly, but are
young/middle-aged ex-counterintelligence or airborne troops who pose a
security threat to the state.
