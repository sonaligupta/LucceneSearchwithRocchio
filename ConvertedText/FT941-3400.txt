FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Rugby Estates net worth will triple after
flotation


   By SIMON DAVIES


Rugby Estates, the property investment company run by the former property
team at Hillsdown, the food group, is planning to raise Pounds 20m from a
flotation which will triple its net worth.
Rugby Estates was set up in 1990, 51 per cent owned by the management, led
by Mr David Tweeddale-Tye, chairman, and Mr Andrew Wilson, managing
director, and 49 per cent by Hillsdown. It started from scratch and had net
assets of Pounds 6.8m at the end of 1993, and a property portfolio now
valued at Pounds 29.2m.
The management is offering a three-year-old company which made pre-tax
profits of only Pounds 2m in 1993. But they boast a long and profitable
history with Hillsdown, which almost floated its property arm in 1987.
Mr Tye ran Hillsdown's property arm throughout the 1980s. He built up gross
assets of Pounds 100m and pre-tax profits of Pounds 18m at the market peak
of 1989, and succeeded in selling around two thirds of its portfolio before
the slump.
Rugby will raise Pounds 19.7m net of expenses from the share placement, of
which Pounds 4.7m will be used to repay a loan to Hillsdown and Pounds 2.6m
to buy a portfolio of properties from the food group. Gearing will fall to 5
per cent, providing scope for new investment.
Hillsdown is selling its entire shareholding, valued at about Pounds 4m,
through the placement. The management will own about 13 per cent of the
enlarged company.
Mr Tye said Rugby would continue to focus on retail properties, which
represent 80 per cent of the current portfolio. It is also likely to remain
an active property trader.
Rugby's speciality is buying secondary market properties where it can add
value through intensive management. The company's first investment, the
Brunswick Centre, has appreciated by 93 per cent since its purchase for
Pounds 2.85m in January 1991.
The full prospectus will be issued on March 30, and dealings are expected to
commence on April 8.
