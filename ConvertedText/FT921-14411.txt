FT  16 JAN 92 / International Company News: European sales offset GM, Ford
losses in N America


   By JOHN GRIFFITHS


FORD and General Motors yesterday announced record sales in western Europe
last year, helping to offset their sharply deteriorating market performances
and heavy losses in North America.
Ford, second behind GM in North America, outperformed its rival in Europe,
claiming 1.58m sales, compared with GM's 1.565m.
Ford's sales increased by 4 per cent, or 28,000 units, on 1990, and by 2 per
cent on the previous record year of 1989.
GM sales set a record for the seventh year in succession, but were up only 1
per cent - or 15,000 units.
With total west European car sales still being finalised, the precise market
shares of both companies have yet to be identified. Both, however, are
expected to trail well behind the market-leading Volkswagen group.
Ford said its Fiesta model set its own sales and production records to
become the best-selling model in its class. Both sales and output rose by 2
per cent, two 615,000 and 620,000 respectively.
Despite a poor reception for the latest Escort/Orion range in the UK, sales
throughout the region as a whole jumped by 24 per cent last year, to
620,000.
Sales of Ford's larger cars, Sierra and Scorpio, declined; Sierra by 0.4 per
cent to 271,000 and Sierra by 0.2 per cent to 69,000.
In percentage terms at least, by far the biggest sales jump for Ford - from
1,200 to 7,200 - came in sales of US-produced cars, particularly its Probe
coupe. Ford expects a boost from the Probe from 1993, when it is expected to
be sold in right hand drive form as the Capri in the UK.
