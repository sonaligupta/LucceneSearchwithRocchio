FT  12 NOV 92 / International Company News: BIL sells 7.5% stake in Air New
Zealand


   By TERRY HALL


   WELLINGTON


BRIERLEY Investments, the New Zealand hotels and investment concern, has
sold a 7.5 per cent stake in Air New Zealand to institutional investors in
the UK, Asia and the US.
The move reduces BIL's ownership from 42.5 to 35 per cent, but the company
remains the airline's largest shareholder. The other major shareholders are
Qantas, the Australian flag carrier, with 20 per cent, and Japan Airlines
with 5 per cent.
Mr Bob Matthew, BIL executive director and Air New Zealand chairman, said
that BIL intended to keep its 35 per cent interest in Air New Zealand for
the long term, but had always planned to sell the parcel of B class shares.
The shares are believed to have been bought at around NZDollars 1.35 a
share, and were sold at NZDollars 2.70, ex dividend.
Analysts say the sale has no implications for the Australian government's
flotation of Qantas.
Both Air New Zealand and Brierley Investments have said they were interested
in buying a shareholding in the Australian carrier, and they may join a
consortium with Singapore Airlines.
The Singapore government is the largest shareholder in Brierley Investments,
and is also a partner with it in UK hotel group Mount Charlotte.
