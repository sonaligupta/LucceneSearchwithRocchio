FT  01 JUL 92 / Letter: Realities of airline competition


   From Mr DECLAN P CONROY


Sir, Mr Thomas McDonogh (Letters, June 24) is badly misinformed. His most
seriously misguided allegation refers to airlines he considers to be
technically bankrupt. Aer Lingus utterly rejects any such allegation. The
company not only has its shareholder's original investment intact but has
also accumulated considerable reserves. The last published accounts show an
original investment in Aer Lingus of IRPounds 74m, with accumulated profits
of IRPounds 324m reflecting shareholder's funds of IRPounds 398m, with a
gearing ratio of 109 per cent.
On a number of other issues Mr McDonogh fails to include reality in the
picture he paints. Aer Lingus, a 'national carrier' whose staffing levels
and cost base are in line with both private and state owned airlines, is the
most punctual airline in Europe, hardly a sign of 'inefficiency'. In a
survey of the top 1,000 Irish companies conducted by Mr McDonogh's Air
Transport Users Committee, Aer Lingus has been voted 'Airline of the Year -
1992'. This award was secured in the face of competition from airlines such
as Lufthansa, Delta, SAS, and Air France.
To suggest that little or no competition exists on most routes in Europe is
absurd. In the markets Aer Lingus serves, over 30 airlines operate both
scheduled and charter flights.
