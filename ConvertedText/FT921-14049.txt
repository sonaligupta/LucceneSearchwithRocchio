FT  17 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: MPs demand new watchdog - City
Regulation


   By DAVID OWEN


THE GOVERNMENT faced calls from two of its senior backbenchers for improved
City regulation yesterday, David Owen writes.
Mr Anthony Beaumont-Dark, MP for Birmingham Selly Oak and a long-standing
member of the Commons treasury and Civil Service committee, called on the
government to consider setting up a body such as the Securities and Exchange
Commission in the US.
The recent string of large corporate collapses showed that self-regulation
was proving to be 'somewhat less than satisfactory', he said. Under a system
of self-regulation, those involved 'tend to protect each other so they don't
get caught'.
He was supported by Sir Peter Tapsell, MP for Lindsey East, who was a
managing partner of James Capel, the stockbroker, for 30 years.
For the government, Ms Gillian Shephard, a junior Treasury minister, said
the recent collapses did not mean that the City was riddled with fraud or
that the regulatory system had failed. The present government had done 'more
than any other' to tighten City regulation, she said.
