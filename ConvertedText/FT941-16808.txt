FT  07 JAN 94 / International Company News: GE wins court injunction against
Korean company


   By MARTIN DICKSON


   NEW YORK


General Electric said yesterday it had won a court order from a US judge
banning South Korea's Iljin Corporation from the commercial manufacture of a
type of industrial diamond for seven years. The ruling also demands the
destruction of its equipment for making the stones.
The injunction by Judge Nathaniel Gorton, a US district judge in Boston,
follows a ruling by a federal jury in the city last summer that Iljin had
misappropriated and used trade secrets stolen from GE.
GE, which invented the technique for manufacturing synthetic diamonds in the
1950s, had been fighting the case since 1989, when it alleged the technology
being used by the Korean firm had been purchased from a former GE employee
and was stolen.
The diamonds involved in the suit are 'saw grade' - a type used in cutting
and grinding applications.
Iljin will have 30 days to return to GE or destroy all documents and
equipment related to GE trade secrets.
Analysts noted that Iljin carried out business with the US, so failure to
comply with the order could carry the risk of court-ordered trade sanctions.
