FT  23 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Sycamore warns of write-offs


Sycamore Holdings, the lossmaking office, hospital and garden furniture
group, yesterday postponed its interim results and warned of substantial
write-offs this year.
Its shares fell  3/4 p to 1 1/4 p.
The announcement comes just three days after the resignation of
non-executive director, Mr Michael Hunton.
The group said its bankers were reviewing the level of financing facilities
in light of the expected provisions. Sycamore has been in discussions with
its bankers since last year, when the value of net assets fell to less than
half its called up share capital.
The results have been delayed pending a review of trading at Cygnet, a
wholly owned subsidiary.
