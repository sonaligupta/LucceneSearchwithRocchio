FT  24 NOV 92 / EC urged to learn BCCI lessons


   By ANDREW HILL


   BRUSSELS


THE European Community was urged yesterday to strengthen its legislation to
avoid a repeat of last year's collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce
International.
Sir Leon Brittan, financial services commissioner, suggested to finance
ministers a series of additions and amendments which he thinks should apply
to the whole financial services sector.
Based on the recommendations of four EC inquiries into the BCCI affair, he
wants to:
oblige financial groups to have a transparent corporate structure, easing
supervision;
make it compulsory for such groups to have their head office and registered
office in the same country;
require external auditors to report 'relevant information' on financial
groups to the supervisory authority;
allow financial supervisors to pass information to official inspectors
investigating fraud and abuses of company law.
Sir Leon said he also hoped to strengthen international co-operation between
supervisors by pressing for agreements between the EC and third countries,
particularly the US and Japan. He also wants a ministerial or Commission
recommendation laying out the circumstances in which supervisors could veto
the appointment or reappointment of external auditors.
