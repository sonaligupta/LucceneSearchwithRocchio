FT  14 APR 94 / Russia steps up airline safety

Russia's air transport minister yesterday announced plans for a 2 per cent
levy on airline revenues to fund tighter supervision of the country's
fragmented airline industry. The new controls follow last month's Airbus
crash in which children were believed to have been learning how to fly. The
controls would include the issue of regular proficiency certificates to
airline staff. The government has also approved a long delayed document
transforming Aeroflot-Russian International Airlines, the state-owned
national carrier, into a joint stock company, which means it can be
privatised. It is not clear whether the company will be able to resist staff
pressures for its break up into four staff-owned carriers. The Russian
airline industry, which has already broken up into dozens of mini-carriers,
needs consolidation to withstand international competition and its
credibility has been so damaged that the International Airline Passengers'
Association yesterday warned its members not to fly over any part of the
former Soviet Union.
