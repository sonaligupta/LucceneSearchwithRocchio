FT  11 MAR 92 / Glynwed holds payout as profits decline: UK engineering
group's shares rise as market sees signs of recovery


   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent


GLYNWED International, the UK engineering group, is holding its 1991
dividend at 1990 levels in spite of its worst trading figures since the
recession of the early 1980s.
The immediate response to a fall in Glynwed's 1991 pre-tax profits to Pounds
25.5m from Pounds 70.3m earned in 1990 was to push the shares up by 14p to
239p, giving a value to the group approaching Pounds 500m.
Glynwed is scooping Pounds 15.3m out of its reserves to pay a final dividend
of 7.5p, bringing total payments to shareholders for 1991 of 11.65p, and to
cover the costs of lopping off sections of its recession-hit business.
But the market took that as a sign of confidence that manufacturing industry
in general is readying itself for more prosperous times.
The profit figures were no worse than analysts had predicted. The range of
Glynwed's interests, from up-market Aga stoves through copper tubing to
plastic micro-irrigation systems, mean the group is exposed to a wide range
of economic sectors, especially in the UK which accounts for nearly 70 per
cent of turnover.
Glynwed's trading in the second half of 1991 was better than in the first
half: pre-tax profits were 45 per cent higher. The management has been
assaulting costs which could mean savings of up to Pounds 20m this year.
Although the shake-out in manufacturing industry has not been on the scale
of the early 1980s, the assault has been painful. Over the past year, the
number of Glynwed's employees has fallen to about 12,000 people from 13,715.
More than 1,400 of the jobs lost have been in the UK.
'I believe that the beneficial effects of the actions already taken should
ensure that profitability of 1992, particularly in the second half of the
year, will be appreciably better than in 1991,' said Mr Gareth Davies,
chairman.
Yet the qualification in Mr Davies's statement to the stock exchange made it
clear Glynwed at least is not basing its future plans on hopes of an
immediate economic revival.
'The group's prospects for 1992 depend less on expectations of any
improvement in market conditions than on the consequences of the
considerable work done - mainly during the past year but with more to come -
to cut costs and improve the efficiency of operations,' he said.
