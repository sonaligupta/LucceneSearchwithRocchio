FT  15 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indonesia sets fire to nutmeg
stocks


   By REUTER


   JAKARTA


INDONESIA IS setting fire to hundreds of tonnes of aromatic nutmeg in a
desperate attempt to boost world prices, a trade ministry official said
yesterday, reports Reuter from Jakarta.
Oversupply on the world market had for some years depressed the value of the
spice, he said. Indonesia produces 70 per cent of the world's supply of
12,000 tonnes a year and Grenada the remaining 30 per cent. Indonesian
traders are trying to decide what to do with the 5,000 tonnes in stocks they
hold. Last week exporters set fire to 300 tonnes of the spice and sent
prices up Dollars 50 (Pounds 32.40) to Dollars 600 a tonne.
