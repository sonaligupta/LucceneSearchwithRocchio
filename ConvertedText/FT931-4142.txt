FT  12 MAR 93 / The Taurus Collapse: Lamont's Pounds 800m windfall


   By PETER NORMAN


THE DECISION to abandon Taurus could provide Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, with windfall savings of about Pounds 800m a year, but should
not result in any last-minute alteration to his Budget plans, Peter Norman
writes.
In the 1990 Budget, Mr John Major, then chancellor, announced plans to
abolish the 0.5 per cent stamp duty on share transactions to coincide with
the introduction of Taurus. But in January this year the Stock Exchange said
it would not be 'going live' with the computer settlement system until April
1994.
That means Mr Lamont will have been able to take account of the revenues
from stamp duty into his Budget. Treasury officials estimate that stamp duty
on share transactions produces between Pounds 800m and Pounds 900m in a
financial year. The duty yielded Pounds 1.7bn in 1991-92 of which roughly 50
per cent came from share transfers.
