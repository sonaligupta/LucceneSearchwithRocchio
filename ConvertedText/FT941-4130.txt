FT  12 MAR 94 / International Company News: Trygg-Hansa returns to black

Trygg-Hansa SPP, the Swedish insurer, rebounded to an operating profit of
SKr1.72bn (Dollars 215.3m) in 1993 from a SKr5.14bn deficit the year before.
The insurer has left behind huge losses associated with the country's
banking crisis and begun to disengage from reinsurance.
The result followed a similar turnround announced earlier this week by
Skandia, Sweden's other big insurance group. It posted a record operating
profit in 1993 of SKr2.01bn. Trygg is to pay a dividend of SKr3.00 per share
after suspending the payout last year.
The main factor in Trygg's turnround was the non-recurring SKr6.03 loss
incurred in 1992, when the group's large holdings in Gota AB, the holding
company of state-rescued Gota Bank, and two collapsed credit insurers were
written down to zero.
However, Trygg also benefited in 1993 from a 77 per cent improvement in its
insurance result, which rose to a profit of SKr890m from SKr502m, and a leap
in investment income to SKr1.1bn from SKr133m.
Trygg said a significant factor in the insurance result was a drop in losses
from reinsurance, reached SKr470m in 1992, in part due to the cost of its
exposure to Hurrican Andrew. The group stopped writing new reinsurance
business in October last year.
