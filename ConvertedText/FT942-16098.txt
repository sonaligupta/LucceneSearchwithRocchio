FT  12 APR 94 / International Company News: Fyffes in talks on European
purchase

A significant European acquisition is looming at Fyffes, the fresh fruit and
vegetable distributor, which will provide a strong boost to its banana sales
in the continental market.
Speaking after the company's annual meeting in Dublin yesterday, Mr Carl
McCann, finance director, said that a due diligence process was under way
with a European fruit distribution company, and that several other
medium-sized acquisition opportunities were being considered.
He expected 'as much as half' of the group's IPounds 92m (Pounds 89m) cash
hoard would be spent on acquisitions by the end of the year.
The group is aiming to sell 27m boxes of bananas this year, up from 18m in
1993, with 7m of the increase targeted for Europe. If the acquisitions were
to fall through, however, the company might face difficulties reaching the
target.
Interest income is projected to fall to IPounds 6m this year, from IPounds
9.6m which contributed 30 per cent of 1993 pre-tax profits.
Two acquisitions last year in Spain and Denmark cost IPounds 12m. They will
increase turnover by IPounds 150m in a full year.
