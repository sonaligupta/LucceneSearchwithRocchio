NORGESKREDITT, the Norwegian private sector mortgage bank, yesterday
announced a sharp rise in nine months pre-tax profit to NKr219.8m (Dollars
29.9m) from NKr98m, helped by an increase in net interest income and
securities gains.
Group nine-month net interest income rose by NKr52.3m to NKr229.6m as last
year's NKr7.8m in securities losses were transformed into gains of NKr71m
this year.
At the net level, profits more than doubled to NKr158.3m from NKr70.6m.
Operating costs rose to NKr48.7m from NKr41.1m as losses on loans and
guarantees fell to NKr41.6m from NKr47m. Norgeskreditt said the aggregate
principal amount of loans in default for more than 90 days rose to NKr175.5m
from NKr156.7m.
'These loans are not in default with regard to the payment of the agreed
interest,' Norgeskreditt explained.
Mr Trond Wennberg, president, forecast the bank would achieve growth of 5 to
10 per cent in loan volume by the mid-1990s. Demand for loans has been
higher this year.
