FT  29 JAN 92 / Money Markets: UK rates unmoved


   By SIMON LONDON


UK money market conditions were slightly easier yesterday, although rates
above one month remained unchanged, suggesting that few operators see room
for an early cut in base rates, writes Simon London.
The Bank of England forecast a liquidity shortage of Pounds 900m early in
the session, revised down to Pounds 850m. The main factor was maturing
repurchase agreements, draining Pounds 670m from the market for the second
day in succession, as assistance injected earlier in the month is rolled
over.
In early assistance the Bank of England bought Pounds 465m paper for resale
to the market on February 12 and 13 at 10 7/16 per cent, identical to the
Pounds 177m injected on the same terms on Monday. A further Pounds 37m was
added before the end of the morning session, through the outright purchase
of band 1 bills at 10 3/8 per cent.
Afternoon assistance ampounted to Pounds 357m, again through the purchase of
band 1 at 10 3/8 per cent. Late assistance amounted to Pounds 25m, bringing
the total liquidity injection for the day to Pounds 884m.
The unsecured overnight money rate was steady at around 11 per cent during
the morning, falling to 8 per cent in the afternoon as market conditions
loosened. At the close the overnight rate was at 10 3/4 - 1/2 per cent.
Longer rates were litle changed, suggesting that participants still see no
room for an early cut in interest rates.
Three month interbank funds traded at 10 5/8 - 1/2 per cent from 10 - 9/16
per cent on Monday; one month interbank money was 10 3/4 - 5/8 per cent,
from 10 13/16 - 9/16 per cent.
However, operators in the futures market were more optimistic. The March
short sterling contract on the London International Financial Futures
Exchange traded up to 89.82, from 89.74 on Monday, implying base lending
rates of 10.18 per cent by the Spring.
In Frankfurt, call money rates were marginally higher for the second day
running, at 9.55/65 per cent from 9.50/60 per cent on Monday and the 9.40/50
per cent level which prevailed for most of last week.
Pension payments are draining funds from the market this week, although
yesterday the Bundesbank moved to relieve the liquidity squeeze by injecting
funds held on deposit for the public sector under Section 17 of the
Bundesbank Act.
In Tokyo call money was easier at 5 9/16 per cent from 5 23/32 per cent on
Monday.
