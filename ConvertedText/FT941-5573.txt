FT  05 MAR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Spices


Black pepper prices, especially for 'asta' grades, rose considerably during
the week, reaching a level in the US Market of about Dollars 88 a lb c and f
New York and Dollars 1,875 a tonne c and f Europe, reports Man Producten.
India had been expected to offer abundantly from the new crop by this time
of the year but a very disappointing and somewhat delayed crop forced the
shorts to cover. White pepper prices also tended firmer: about Dollars 2,850
a tonne, cif, for March/April shipment.
