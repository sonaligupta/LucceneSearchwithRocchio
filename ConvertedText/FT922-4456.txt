   STOCKHOLM


THE SKr1.85bn offer of shares in SSAB, Sweden's state-controlled steel
company, has been oversubscribed among private and institutional investors,
it was announced yesterday.
The offer involves 126,666 units made up of government-guaranteed risk-free
bonds priced at SKr14,800 and redeemable in 1994 for SKr17,000. Under the
government's plan, 60,000 of the units have been offered to the general
public and these are over-subscribed.
Yesterday, it was announced that the share allocation for individuals would
be decided by lottery under the authorisation of an independent legal
authority with the stipulation that in the first instance nobody could
purchase more than one unit.
There has also been a large oversubscription among institutional investors
for the 60,000 units of shares allocated for them, with 15,000 reserved for
buyers from outside Sweden.
'The privatisation has been a great success, not just for SSAB but for our
whole privatisation programme', said Mr Per Westerberg, Sweden"s industry
minister. The company is the first of 35 separate privatisations that are
being planned over the next few years in Sweden's state industry sector.
Further information on SSAB's new shareholders will be made available in two
weeks. The government is selling 48 per cent of SSAB's equity and 60 per
cent of its voting rights.
