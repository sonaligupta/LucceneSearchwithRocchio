FT  16 JAN 92 / International Company News: Cragnotti group acquires
loss-making food concern


   By HAIG SIMONIAN

CRAGNOTTI & Partners Capital Investment (C&P), the investment group formed
by Mr Sergio Cragnotti, which includes several leading international banks
among its shareholders, yesterday sealed its purchase of Fedital, the
loss-making Italian foods group.
The acquisition, which followed a three-round auction last month, marks a
double first.
Firstly, it represents C&P's first European acquisition as part of its plans
to assemble a portfolio of businesses in the food industry. The food sector
is one of the three areas, alongside packaging and detergents, identified by
Mr Cragnotti as ripe for investment.
Since its formation last year, C&P has spent heavily to buy companies in
both other areas. However, purchases in the foods sector have so far been
limited to CICA, a large, privately-owned Brazilian tinned foods group.
The sale of Fedital also marks the first large asset disposal by the special
commissioners and court supervising the affairs of Federconsorzi, the
bankrupt Italian farm services group.
Fedital, which has a sizeable market share for long-life milk in southern
Italy, specialises in dairy and cheese products.
In spite of its established Polenghi Lombardo trademark, other bidders for
the company are believed to have been dissuaded by the considerable
uncertainty surrounding the group's accounts.
Under the sale agreement to C&P, the L55bn (Dollars 46.3m) offer price can
be cut by L10bn subject to the findings of an audit now under way.
Mr Cragnotti, who used to run the Enimont chemicals joint venture, said C&P
would recapitalise the group and seek agreement with unions on substantial
job cuts.
C&P remained interested in other purchases in the foods sector, notably in
the event of disposals by the state-owned IRI holding company.
