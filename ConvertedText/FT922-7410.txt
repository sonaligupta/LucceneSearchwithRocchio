FT  19 MAY 92 / Letter: Appropriate safeguards and reforms for pensions (2)


   From Mr LEE MALLETT


Sir, With reference to Norma Cohen's article 'Reforms that err on the safe
side' (May 9) on the recent National Association of Pension Funds
conference, I believe that much stronger safeguards should be placed on
pension funds, about whose performance it is very difficult, if not
impossible, to obtain information.
There should be a further safeguard which parliament should consider -
disclosure. The best way to see what is going on in a fund is to require
public annual reports of performance which break down investments by sector
 -gilts, equities, property etc. Then we can all see what is being done with
our money, and pick the fund of our choice.
