FT  08 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Merchant Retail


The lack of an exceptional disposal loss of Pounds 223,000 and lower
interest charges enabled Merchant Retail Group to return to profit for the
26 weeks to October 1 with Pounds 243,000 pre-tax, against a Pounds 31,000
deficit last time and full year losses of Pounds 4.83m.
Operating profits at Joplings, the north-east of England department stores,
edged ahead to Pounds 764,000 (Pounds 753,000) but Normans, the south-west
supermarket chain, fell to Pounds 958,000 (Pounds 1.17m). Losses at the
Perfume Shop were steady at Pounds 203,000 (Pounds 202,000).
Turnover was Pounds 72.3m (Pounds 80.3m). The interest charge was Pounds
815,000 (Pounds 887,000). Earnings per share were 0.18p (losses 0.15p). The
interim dividend is passed; there was a 0.2p payment last time. Shareholders
are being asked to approve a reduction in the share premium account to allow
the resumption of dividends.
