profits move ahead 249%

WD & HO Wills Holdings, the Australian tobacco group 67 per cent owned by
BAT, said net profits after abnormal items rose 249 per cent to ADollars 32m
(USDollars 22m) in 1992.
Sales rose 12.7 per cent to ADollars 834m, resulting in a 15 per cent
increase in the group's share of the Australian market, which is slowly
shrinking.
The result was struck after an abnormal loss of ADollars 10.3m, reflecting
restructuring costs, and a write-down of property assets to recoverable
values.
The directors declared a fully-franked final dividend of 9 cents a share,
compared with 3 cents a year earlier, making a full-year dividend of 12
cents.
Sagasco, the Australian energy group, yesterday said net profits increased
by 8 per cent to a record ADollars 52.5m in 1992, on turnover up 6.7 per
cent to ADollars 380.6m. The final dividend was 8 cents, making a total of
14.5 cents fully franked, up from 13 cents. AWA, the Australian electronics
group, has blamed a downturn in defence sales for an interim net loss of
ADollars 4.9m in the first half to December, against an interim net profit
of ADollars 3.8m in the same period of the previous year.
