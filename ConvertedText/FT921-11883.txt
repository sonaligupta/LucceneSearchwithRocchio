FT  29 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Murray Smaller Markets lower


Substantial exposure to the Far East, one of the better performing areas of
its portfolio, helped limit the decline in net asset value at Murray Smaller
Markets Trust.
The figure of 271.2p per share at November 30 reflected a fall of just 1.7
per cent over the six months since the trust's year end in May. It compared
with a drop over the same period of 6.4 per cent for the FT-Actuaries World
Index.
Net revenue rose to Pounds 1.34m (Pounds 1.2m) for earnings of 2.39p (2.14p)
per share.
An interim dividend of 1.25p was paid earlier this month.
