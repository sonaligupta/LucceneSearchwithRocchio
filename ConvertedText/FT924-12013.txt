FT  22 OCT 92 / Dietrich bracelet leads sale: Saleroom


   By ANTONY THORNCROFT


A RUBY bracelet, created for Marlene Dietrich in 1937 by the Paris jeweller
Louis Arpels, sold for Dollars 990,000 (Pounds 608,668) at Sotheby's in New
York on Tuesday - more than double the estimate.
The bracelet was formed from various of her jewels and the actress described
it as her 'Busby Berkeley bracelet - as it is so wonderfully large and
splashy'. She wore it often and featured it in the movie Stage Fright.
The Dietrich piece was a highlight of a successful jewels auction totalling
Dollars 17.1m (Pounds 10.5m) with 86 per cent sold. There was an auction
record for pearls when a necklace of 23 cultured pearls with a platinum and
diamond clasp sold for Dollars 2.3m (Pounds 1.4m).
All 99 lots in the collection of the late Mrs Harry Winston, wife of one of
the most innovative jewellery designers of the 20th century, found buyers,
bringing in Dollars 5.18m (Pounds 3.2m). A pair of diamond chandelier
pendant ear clips, made in 1961, sold for Dollars 1.4m (Pounds 879,188).
Christie's in London was disposing yesterday of the library of the late John
Sparrow, the Warden of All Souls, Oxford, and an inveterate book collector.
Virtually everything sold and prices far exceeded estimate. Top price was
the Pounds 7,700, more than twice the forecast, for a 1790 set of Johnson's
The Works of the English Poets.
To complete this sudden revival in the art market, Sotheby's met strong
dealer demand yesterday for the contents of Shadwell Park near Thetford,
Norfolk. A Regency sofa table, estimated at up to Pounds 20,000, sold for
Pounds 75,900.
