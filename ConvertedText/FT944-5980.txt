FT  01 DEC 94 / NHS systems 'at risk of fraud'


   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent


Some National Health Service systems depend heavily on trust and carry
inherent risks of fraud, the Audit Commission says in a report today.
The commission says, however, that incidences of detected fraud and
corruption are very low in relation to the size of NHS expen-diture.
A survey of 460 trusts and health authorities revealed 960 cases of
malpractice involving losses of Pounds 6m in the past three years, compared
with spending of Pounds 80bn on NHS services in England and Wales in the
same period.
The report says attention should be focused on minimising risks. These are
greatest in the primary health services area, where 25 per cent of NHS
spending takes place.
It says areas where existing systems leave public money at risk include the
potential inflation of practice lists by family doctors, false claims for
sight tests by opticians, failure by pharmacists to remit prescription money
and false claims for services and allowances by dentists. Fraud by patients
is also possible.
The commission says that in one family health services authority area
patients may have falsely claimed exemption from prescription charges worth
Pounds 560,000.
