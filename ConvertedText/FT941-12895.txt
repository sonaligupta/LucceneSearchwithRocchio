FT  28 JAN 94 / World News in Brief: Two die in Ulster violence


A man was killed and his wife injured by gunmen at their home in Ballymena,
Co Antrim, last night. Earlier, the Ulster Freedom Fighters admitted killing
a Roman Catholic man in south Belfast. Scotland Yard said firebomb attacks
at three stores in Oxford Street, London, were probably the work of the IRA.
