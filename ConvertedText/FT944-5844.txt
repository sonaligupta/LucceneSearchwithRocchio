Metropolitan Life, the South African life assurer controlled by the
recently-listed black investment group New Africa Investments, saw total
income advance by 20 per cent to R1.67bn (Dollars 472.3m) in the year to
September and is increasing its total dividend.
The improvement resulted from a combination of a rise in investment income,
15 per cent higher at R452.5m, and a 22 per cent improvement in premium
income to R1.22bn.
Attributable income also rose by 22 per cent to R86.5m, up from R70.8m a
year ago.
The directors have declared a final dividend of 53.5 cents a share, which
raises the total dividend for the year to 83 cents, up 24 per cent from the
previous year's 67 cents.
Total assets increased by 29 per cent to R7.38bn from R5.73bn.
Metlife has also published, for the first time, a statement of actuarial
values of assets and liabilities, which show a surplus of R1.86bn, up 36 per
cent from last year.
Mr Marius Smith, managing director, said the company remained focused on
recurring premium business, which constitutes close to 92 per cent of the
total, but he added that he expected an increase in new business over the
coming year.
