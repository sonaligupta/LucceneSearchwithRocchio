FT  02 JUL 92 / EC drive stepped up by City


   By DAVID MARSH, European Editor


BRITAIN plans to use its six months of EC presidency to step up its campaign
to bring the European central bank to London.
Sir Brian Jenkins, the lord mayor of London, who is leading the City's
campaign, said yesterday he would keep up the struggle in spite of the
weekend call by 10 of Britain's 11 EC partners to place the bank in Bonn.
'I'm sure it's not over,' he said. We will press on and pursue what we've
been doing so far.'
Government officials said Sir Brian's message would be supported by
ministers, who will be shrugging off the vote in favour of Bonn at the
indecisive Lisbon summit.
Sir Brian's drive is being given strong backing by Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton,
governor of the Bank of England, who is sticking to his view that the
operational arm of the bank at least should be in London.
Sir Brian said Germany was trying to make acceptance of Frankfurt or Bonn as
the bank site a condition of Germany's willingness to take part in economic
and monetary union (Emu). 'The Germans will only opt in (to Emu) if they get
the bank,' he said.
