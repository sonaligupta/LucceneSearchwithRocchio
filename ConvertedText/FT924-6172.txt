FT  23 NOV 92 / Letter: Independent central bank not complete answer


   From Mr WALTER GREY


Sir, Mr Thomas Welsh (Letters, November 17) is not alone in endorsing the
'convincing' case for an independent central bank conducting monetary policy
in place of vote-seeking politicians.
Such an institutional reform, however, is not sufficient for greater price,
and hence general economic, stability. What, at the official level, is also
necessary is fiscal balance, or neutrality, maintained over the length of
the business ('economic') cycle - if an independent central bank, dedicated
to the maintenance of price stability at all stages of the political cycle,
indeed permits the business cycle to persist. Without this, and without an
appropriate fiscal/monetary policy mix, the goal of economic stability,
including sustainable growth, is hard to achieve.
