FT  25 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Sindall shares recover as court defeat
studied


   By NIGEL CLARK


Shares in William Sindall, the Cambridge-based builder and civil engineer,
yesterday recovered 15p of their 25p fall on Friday to close at 80p.
The Friday fall followed the relisting of the shares after Cambridgeshire
County Council won an appeal against a judgment given in favour of the
company. It related to an action for the rescinding of a Pounds 5.08m land
purchase contract made in 1988.
Mr Ray Johnston, company secretary, said the shares had returned to the
level before the judgment began to have an effect.
Sindall had bought the land, a former school playing field in Cambridge,
from the council in 1988 with outline planning permission for housing, but
later discovered that a sewer, which was not on the deeds, ran through it.
The shares were suspended on Thursday pending the appeal. In April the
company said it was delaying the publication of its annual results.
Mr Johnston said the results would be published soon but could not give a
date. He said the judgment was a long and complex document which required
considered study.
He added: 'The results will now record the ordinary trading figures of a
company in the contracting sector without the benefit of the windfall we
would have received if the judgment had gone our way.'
