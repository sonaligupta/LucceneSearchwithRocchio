FT  13 APR 94 / Observer: Hoarse Trojans


This is not a joke. Ireland's parliament, the Dail, is thinking of
constructing an underground tunnel between the Leinster House parliament
building and Kildare House, where MPs have their offices.
The 40-yard tunnel would cost about Pounds 200,000. The idea for it came up
at a meeting of the Dail's committee on procedures and privileges, where
some members  - fed up with running a well-established gauntlet of picketing
protestors  - proposed the tunnel as a neat solution.
Things haven't yet come to that sort of pass at the mother of all
parliaments, Westminster. John Major is still prepared to risk the
twice-weekly, 90-second ride from Downing Street to the Commons in the back
of his bullet-proof Daimler.
His problem is the frenzied tunneling going on around him by erstwhile
supporters seeking an escape. That was a joke.
