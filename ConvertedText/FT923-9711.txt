FT  04 AUG 92 / US-style legal funding re-examined


   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent


THE LAW SOCIETY is to re-examine US-style 'no win, no pay' contingency fee
arrangements as an alternative to legal aid as part of an overall review of
methods of funding court cases.
Solicitors are concerned that restrictions on legal aid have put the cost of
going to court beyond the reach of people on average incomes. The review
will examine whether contingency fee arrangements, where lawyers are paid
only if they win the case, could cut the cost of legal aid, which is
expected to exceed Pounds 1bn in 1992-93.
Government attempts to control the rising cost of legal aid by imposing
standard fees for criminal legal-aid work in magistrates' courts have been
opposed by solicitors who have threatened to withdraw from legal-aid work.
The society believes that a more radical solution to the drawbacks of the
legal aid system must be considered. The review will examine whether
contingency fees would increase access to justice or simply encourage the
pursuit of hopeless litigation. It will also ask whether legal aid should
continue to be available in a case that could be funded on a contingency fee
basis and whether insurance cover could be devised against the risk of
paying the other side's costs.
Mr John Appleby, a member of the society's governing council who will head
the review, said yesterday: 'Going to law has become prohibitively
expensive.'
Under present rules, solicitors are not strictly allowed to charge clients
only if they win the case. The government provided for the introduction of a
limited form of contingency fee arrangement in the Courts and Legal Services
Act 1990, but the relevant section has not yet been brought into force.
