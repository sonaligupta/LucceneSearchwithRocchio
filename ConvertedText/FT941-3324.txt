NEC's Super Tower sets the pace


   By MICHAEL WILTSHIRE


The Tokyo headquarters of NEC, the electronics company, has one of the
world's most advanced commercial communications systems, writes Michael
Wiltshire.
Built on the site where NEC first began operations in 1899, the 43-storey
Super Tower, pictured above, features the NEC's Super Aladdin system for
total office automation. This includes electronic mail, electronic statement
and receipt systems for the collection and distribution of documents, an
electronic bulletin board, closed circuit and satellite television services
which links NEC's three north American subsidiaries - NEC America, NEC
Electronics and NEC Technologies.
Other features used by the 6,000 staff of the Super Tower include electronic
telephone notebooks which contain the 35,000 telephone numbers within the
company. There are also automatic message services on telephone terminals.
Office facilities of the Super Tower also include electronic secretarial
services for setting up schedules and monitoring business progress. Staff
work to a flexitime system - 'this seeks to encourage the self-esteem of
company employees by giving them more control and responsibility over their
working time,' says NEC.
