FT  23 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: Lucas enters US private
market to raise Dollars 116m


   By SARA WEBB


LUCAS Industries, the international engineering group, is raising Dollars
116m of 12-year money through the US private placement market. The car and
aerospace components group is the latest in a stream of UK companies to tap
the US private placement market for funds because of the ease of obtaining
relatively cheap, long-term financing.
The bonds, which have a 6.95 per cent coupon, are issued by the US
subsidiary and guaranteed by Lucas, the parent company. The company has
received commitments for Dollars 116m.
Mr Edward Freeborn, director of corporate finance, said the company chose to
use the US private placement market because it was very efficient.
He added that it would have been more expensive for the company to tap the
Eurobond market, and less easy to obtain such long-term financing from UK
banks.
'US (interest) rates for corporate borrowers are at an 18-year low, and this
placement usefully lengthens our average debt maturity,' said Mr Freeborn.
The funds will be used to refinance the group's higher cost debt, mainly
borrowings with a maturity of less than one year.
Lucas had its long-term debt rating lowered from A- to BBB+ by IBCA earlier
this year.
The deal was managed in the US by Wertheim Schroder, who managed a previous
issue for Lucas in March 1992, a Dollars 100m 12-year deal.
Mr Stephen Schechter, managing director of Wertheim Schroder, pointed out
that banks in the UK are unwilling to lend money at maturities of more than
five years, while companies with a credit rating below AA cannot access the
Eurobond market easily.
Lucas's bonds are being placed with US life insurance companies which want
to lock into long-term fixed rate investments at an attractive margin over
US Treasury bonds.
