FT  30 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Halma at Pounds 21m as growth continues


   By ANDREW BOLGER


THE DEVALUATION of sterling helped Halma, the safety and environmental
technology group, maintain its strong record of growing profits and exports.
Pre-tax profits increased by 47 per cent to Pounds 20.9m in the 53 weeks to
April 3, under FRS 3, and by 35 per cent under the old accounting
conventions. Sales rose 23 per cent to Pounds 116m. Overseas sales rose by
35 per cent to Pounds 59.8m and direct exports from the group's UK companies
rose by 34 per cent to Pounds 31.8m.
The group said its net profit margin on sales increased from 16.4 to 18 per
cent and its overall return on capital employed was, at 45 per cent, in
excess of 40 per cent for the 10th consecutive year.
Mr David Barber, chairman, was encouraged that the group had been able to
achieve these figures during a difficult period for the UK economy.
Halma's net cash balances rose from Pounds 4.3m to Pounds 8.5m, although the
group spent Pounds 4.5m on acquiring businesses and had capital expenditure
of Pounds 5.39m.
Mr Barber said that during the 15 months since March 1992, Halma had bought
eight companies and formed four businesses, bringing the total number of
operating companies to 43. He said all the acquired companies had continued
to trade satisfactorily.
Earnings per share rose by 43 per cent to 9.93p (6.92p) under FRS 3,
equivalent to 29 per cent under previous rules. A final dividend of 1.6p
(1.332p) is proposed for a total of 2.636p (2.195p). There is also a 1-for-3
scrip issue.
COMMENT
Even allowing for the strong benefit which sterling's devaluation brought in
the second half, these are very impressive figures. Halma continues to
benefit from legislation which requires investment in industrial safety,
water treatment and gas and fire detection. It can also point to a strong
performance by companies that supply electronic sensors for lifts and
service the US semi-conductor market. The shares, which rose 8p to 256p,
have had a strong run since the beginning of 1991 and are on a prospective
multiple of more than 22. The premium rating is justified, but the shares
look fully valued.
