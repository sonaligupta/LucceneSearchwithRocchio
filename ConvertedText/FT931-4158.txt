FT  12 MAR 93 / Service sector surplus declines to Pounds 594m


   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff


THE service sector produced the lowest surplus on its overseas trade for
almost 11 years in the fourth quarter of last year, official figures
indicated yesterday.
The surplus on services was Pounds 594m compared with Pounds 892m in the
third quarter and Pounds 1.05bn in the same quarter a year earlier.
However, the overall invisibles surplus, which includes government
transfers, interest payments, profits and dividends as well as services, was
revised up to Pounds 794m in the fourth quarter from an initial estimate of
Pounds 600m.
This meant that last year's shortfall on the current account, which gives
the UK's balance of trade in goods and invisibles, was Pounds 11.9bn
compared with a shortfall of Pounds 6.38bn in 1991.
The figures from the Central Statistical Office show that the UK's surplus
on invisibles remains on an upwards trend. This is mainly because of the
improving balance on interest, profits and dividends resulting from lower UK
interest rates and the devalued pound.
Interest, profits and dividends showed a surplus of Pounds 1.23bn in the
fourth quarter compared with Pounds 1.61bn in the third quarter but only
Pounds 160m in the second. The better surpluses of the second half of last
year reflected the fact that sterling's drop has boosted net earnings on
direct investment by increasing the sterling value of money earned overseas.
Net earnings were also helped by recovery in the US.
Lower UK base rates meant that banks' net interest payments abroad were
lower than in the first half of the year.
The disappointing surplus on services in the fourth quarter was partly due
to large outflows of insurance payments from the UK following Hurricane
Andrew in the US. The surplus on services for the year as a whole was Pounds
3.7bn, the lowest annual surplus since 1980.
Earnings by UK residents on portfolio investment abroad were Pounds 3.27bn
in the fourth quarter, the highest figure on record. The CSO said this
reflected greater investment in bonds, which have a higher rate of return
than equities.
The deficit on government transfers was Pounds 1.01bn in the fourth quarter.
For the year as a whole the deficit was Pounds 5.1bn, significantly higher
than in the previous year when payments to the UK for its contribution in
the Gulf war reduced the deficit to Pounds 1.34bn.
Overseas authorities invested Pounds 1.29bn in gilts last year, although in
the fourth quarter they disinvested in gilts by Pounds 158m. Private
investors bought Pounds 33m of gilts in the fourth quarter and Pounds 1.03bn
in the year as a whole.
