FT  12 APR 94 / UK Company News: Flextech's new Dollars 30m fund for
investment


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


Flextech, the former oil services company which turned itself into a media
group, is getting together with Hit Entertainment, the specialist programme
distributor, to create a Dollars 30m (Pounds 20.5m) fund to invest in
animated programmes.
The aim is to create a range of new animated titles - among the most
international of all programme genres - in the UK, continental Europe and
the US.
Discussions are already taking place with a number of banks.
And it is believed the fund could be in place within a matter of months.
The consortium that will run the operation is likely to be expanded to
include HTV, the ITV company for Wales and the West and an international
video distributor.
Flextech, the majority shareholder of which is TCI of Denver, the largest
cable operator in the US, recently bought a 20 per cent stake in HTV.
Hit, which specialises in the distribution of children's and wildlife
programmes, is already responsible for the distribution of HTV's nature
programme arm, Partridge Films.
In turn, Flextech has a 24 per cent stake in Hit - a company founded by Mr
Peter Orton, a former executive with Henson Associates, producer of The
Muppet Show.
Hit was also involved in raising pre-production finance for series such as
Shakespeare: the Animated Tales and The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends.
The aim is to use the fund to get new animated series off the ground backed
up by selling the rights in advance to a number of leading broadcasters
throughout the world.
The consortium will retain the right to sell the programmes in other parts
of the world.
