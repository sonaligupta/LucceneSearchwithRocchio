FT  20 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Fall in US rates check growth at Sedgwick


   By RICHARD LAPPER


SURPRISING falls in rates in the US insurance market have held back profit
growth at Sedgwick, the insurance broker, which yesterday reported pre-tax
profits of Pounds 41.5m for the first quarter to March 31, marginally down
on the Pounds 42.6m recorded last year.
Earnings per share were 6.4p (6.6p).
Operating income grew to Pounds 178m (Pounds 169m) with expenses rising to
Pounds 147m (Pounds 139m), increases of 2 per cent at constant exchange
rates.
Although insurance underwriting contributed Pounds 200,000 this was offset
by a fall in investment income to Pounds 13.3m (Pounds 14m) and the share of
profits earned by associates to Pounds 600,000 (Pounds 900,000).
Interest payable rose to Pounds 3.6m (Pounds 2.6m).
A strengthening in the US dollar was worth Pounds 1.3m to the group.
Insurance rates in the London market have continued to increase but weakness
in the US market, which contributes between 35 and 40 per cent to the
group's turnover, has undermined growth.
Mr David Rowland, chairman, said US rates had fallen by between 12 and 15
per cent in the first quarter. 'No-one was expecting a glorious upswing but
that it softened again was a surprise.'
Hinting at continual pressure on the group's US expenses Mr Rowland said
Sedgwick saw 'no sign of any change.'
