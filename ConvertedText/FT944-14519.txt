FT  22 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Telemetrix US offshoot expands


Telemetrix, the supplier of specialised electronic components, said that
GTI, its 58 per cent-owned US offshoot, is buying 70 per cent of Promptus
Communications for about Dollars 19m (Pounds 12m) cash.
Promptus supplies high-speed digital network access solutions for
videoconferencing, large-scale data transfer, image transfer, transmission
of integrated voice/data/video information and other multimedia
applications.
GTI will fund the purchase partly from its own cash resources and term debt
and partly from a placing of up to 650,000 shares. Telemetrix is expected to
buy up to 375,000 shares.
Promptus' management will continue to operate the company and will retain
the remaining 30 per cent interest. The acquisition is expected to close
within 60 days and in the interim GTI will make a pre-closing cash infusion
of Dollars 500,000 to fund product development.
At the same time, GTI reported a 44 per cent fall in net income from Dollars
3.56m to Dollars 1.99m for the third quarter to September 30. Sales were 13
per cent ahead at Dollars 37.1m (Dollars 32.8m). Earnings per share were 20
cents (35 cents).
