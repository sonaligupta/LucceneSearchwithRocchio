FT  13 APR 94 / Cross-channel drink trade tops Pounds 1bn


   By MOTOKO RICH


Cross-channel shoppers brought home beer, wine and spirits worth about
Pounds 1.036bn in UK high street prices last year, a report by Whitbread,
the brewer, said yesterday.
The report says the Treasury lost Pounds 470m in duties and value added tax
through cross-channel personal imports of alcoholic drinks, almost double
the amount foregone in 1992.
Almost 30 per cent of all beer purchases were bought in bulk and brought
into the UK by van. Whitbread estimates that this practice has created a
bootlegging trade representing Pounds 22m in profit last year.
Legal beer imports of 1.25m barrels are equivalent to the total beer sales
of 4,500 pubs, or 15.3 per cent of the take-home beer market.
Whitbread believes that 60 per cent of cross-channel beer imports substitute
for UK pub and club sales and 40 per cent of European purchases substitute
for the take-home market.
In addition to losses on beer, the purchase of 83.7 litres of wine and
spirits by cross-channel shoppers - excluding air travellers - amounted to a
retail loss of Pounds 677m.
The popular perception that cross-channel shopping is a south-east
phenomenon is contradicted by Whitbread's statistics, which show that 45 per
cent of cross-channel consumers come from outside London and the south-east.
The central region of England accounts for Pounds 200m in retail losses and
the Yorkshire and north-east region brought home Pounds 100m worth of beer.
On top of retail losses in alcoholic drinks, the Tobacco Manufacturers'
Association estimated that cross-channel shopping for duty-paid tobacco cost
the Treasury about Pounds 100m in 1993.
Last year only 37 per cent of channel passengers bought beer in continental
Europe but the industry fears that figure will increase unless the UK
reduces its duties on alcohol.
