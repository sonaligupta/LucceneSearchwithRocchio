FT  01 JUL 92 / Arrow trial lawyers reinstated


   By JOHN MASON


THE TWO defendants in the second Blue Arrow fraud trial have reversed their
decision to represent themselves in court and have reinstated their lawyers,
John Mason writes.
That follows a decision by UBS Phillips & Drew, which employs the defendants
 -Mr Paul Smallwood and Mr Tim Brown - to pay the income-tax liabilities of
both men as well as their legal fees.
Those liabilities - which may approach Pounds 400,000 for each man - arise
from the Inland Revenue's decision to treat P&D's payment of their legal
fees as a benefit in kind. Mr Smallwood and Mr Brown are both charged with
conspiracy to defraud.
