FT  27 MAY 93 / Farmers 'cheated' in egg scare payout


POULTRY farmers were cheated out of thousands of pounds in compensation for
chickens they were forced to slaughter during the 1980s salmonella scare, a
committee of MPs said yesterday.
They accused the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food of deliberately
short-changing the farmers in an act of 'maladministration that should never
be repeated'.
The select committee for the parliamentary ombudsman said ministers had set
compensation 'at the lowest levels legally defensible'.
After comments in 1988 by Mrs Edwina Currie, then a junior health minister,
that most UK egg production was 'infected with salmonella', egg sales
collapsed and the government introduced a compulsory slaughter scheme for
infected flocks, with compensation.
The ministry decided that only 60 per cent of the birds' value should be
paid in compensation. Poultry farmers were given 14 days to challenge the
level of compensation, but many could not afford to delay payment.
