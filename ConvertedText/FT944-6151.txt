FT  30 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Hampson turns in Pounds 2.57m at halfway
stage


   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent


Hampson Industries, the West Bromwich-based group whose interests include
engineering, furniture and cleaning, reported a 3.7 per cent increase in
first half profits and promised further improvement in the second.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to September 30 were Pounds 2.57m on
turnover of Pounds 46.2m, compared with Pounds 2.48m on sales of Pounds
43.5m in the 1993-94 first half. Last year's figures, however, included
losses of Pounds 97,000 from discontinued operations.
The results are in line with a company statement made last month, when
Hampson said that although second-half profits would increase, they would be
unlikely to meet brokers' expectations. Then market forecasts were that
Hampson would make pre-tax profits of about Pounds 6.5m in the full year.
Brokers' predictions have since been reduced to about Pounds 5.7m, while
Hampson contents itself with the comment that 'there will be an increase in
profits earned in the second half' compared with the those of the first
half.
But the directors have given what they call 'an indication of our confidence
in the future' with an increase in the interim dividend to 0.55p from 0.5p
last time, when total annual payments came to 2p.
First half earnings per share were 2.3p against 2.22p in the 1993-94 first
half.
Operating profits in the period were static at Pounds 2.86m. Sluggish UK
consumer spending is hurting furniture operations, although the group holds
its market share.
Aircraft refurbishment has been held back by falling defence orders, but
Hampson is repositioning to obtain more civil orders; this could take 18
months.
