   By CATHERINE MILTON


Next, the high street fashion retailer, added to the evidence of strong
consumer spending over the Christmas season, reporting that second half
sales in the year to January 31 were expected to be 18 per cent ahead of the
previous year.
'At our half year results on September 25 we reported that we were 10 per
cent up at that point in the second half in both Next Retail and Next
Directory, compared with last year,' said Mr David Jones, chief executive.
'Retail is now up to 18 per cent for the whole six months and Directory has
come down a shade to 9 per cent. By implication we had a very good run up to
Christmas at Next Retail.'
Mr Jones said that the like-for-like increase was about 17 per cent for the
second half with new space accounting for about 1 percentage point of the
rise. Volumes rose about 15 per cent or 16 per cent for the second half.
The company said the estimates for the second half meant the sales rise for
the full year was expected to be 17 per cent in Next Retail and 9 per cent
in Next Directory.
Analysts raised their pre-tax profit forecasts for the full year from about
Pounds 66m to Pounds 70m.
