FT  23 JUL 93 / Observer: No reserve


This year's New York Fed Christmas party should be distinctly enlivened by
the presence of the new governor, Bill McDonough.
Despite his quiet demeanour, McDonough is something of an entertainer in his
way, it transpires. In his First Chicago days he was an active member of the
British-North American Committee, the group of 130 private sector leaders
from the US, Canada and Britain, whose current membership includes the likes
of Sir David Plastow, Ronnie Hampel and John Heimann, and from which, now
being a public servant, McDonough has since stepped down.
Four years ago, the December meeting marking the committee's 20th
anniversary was held in Montreal where the hosts put on a traditional Beaver
Club dinner, complete with live bear and hunter on horseback. The high spot
of the evening, however, was McDonough, whom a friend describes as 'very
Irish really', taking to the floor with the then chairman of the Rank
Organisation, the late Sir Patrick Meaney, to regale the audience with a
medley of songs from the Emerald Isle.
