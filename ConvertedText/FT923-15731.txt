FT  01 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Clientele questions value of
sell-offs


   By RICHARD EVANS


PRIVATISATION has been a great success, according to senior managers of
privatised utilities - but customers appear less convinced.
Interviews with 30 senior managers in the utilities, transport groups and
manufacturing companies privatised over the past decade showed that they
rated success highest for shareholders, followed by employees, with
customers gaining the least.
'It will not come as a surprise to managers that the customer does not rate
the success of privatisation so highly,' says Mr John Mattison, author of
the report, published by public-relations consultants Burson-Marsteller and
Corporate Counsel.
All the managers recognised that one of their main jobs was to provide
quality service at a price customers found acceptable.
For the public, the most positive benefit of privatisation was improved
service, although nearly half of those questioned could not name any
positive aspect. Results were based on more than 1,000 telephone interviews.
Comparisons of the leading privatised utilities - British Telecom, British
Gas, electricity and water - showed that customers thought quality of
service had improved most at BT, with 48 per saying service was better,
followed by British Gas with 29 per cent.
