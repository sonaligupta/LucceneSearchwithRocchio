FT  06 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Prize size no disincentive


   From Mr TOM THRELFALL


Sir, Unlike R L Webb (Letters, January 1), we do not think the introduction
of a Pounds 1m monthly jackpot prize will be counter-productive. We know
from our post bag that a lot of people will be delighted at the chance of
becoming an overnight millionaire.
The overall size of the prize fund has been increased, in order to
accommodate the new prize structure. And we will continue to pay out more
than 185,000 prizes each month in the range of Pounds 50 to Pounds 100,000,
as the odds against winning a prize in any monthly draw remain unchanged at
15,000 to 1 for each Pounds 1 bond unit.
We cannot please everyone. However, we think that we have the spread of
prizes about right.
