FT  12 MAR 94 / International Company News: Readymix falls to IPounds 2.33m


Readymix, the Irish building materials group, saw pre-tax profits decline by
IPounds 660,000 to IPounds 2.33m (Pounds 2.24m) in the year to end-December
1993, on turnover up by 3 per cent from IPounds 30.8m to IPounds 31.7m.
The company said that, despite continuing efforts to minimise its cost base,
lower selling prices and a fall in demand for cement-based products had
eroded margins from 9.7 per cent in 1992 to 7.4 per cent last year.
Earnings per share fell to 5.13p (6.57p).
Nevertheless, an improved final dividend of 2.45p (2.35p) is proposed,
raising the total for the year to 3p (2.9p).
