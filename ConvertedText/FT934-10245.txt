FT  06 NOV 93 / Tories support tenancy change


THE TORY party yesterday backed proposals by a Conservative MP to give
greater rights to council house buyers.
Mr Peter Thurnham, MP for Bolton North East, proposed in a pamphlet that it
should be possible for council tenants to be given 40 per cent of the
freehold of their houses, with first refusal to buy the remainder. He called
for housing benefit to be capped and replaced by a fixed element in family
credit, and for mortgage tax relief to be phased out.
The pamphlet was welcomed by Sir George Young, housing minister.
