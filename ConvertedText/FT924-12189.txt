FT  22 OCT 92 / Saddam wins partial UN victory


   By MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS and REUTER


   NEW YORK


IRAQI President Saddam Hussein last night appeared to have scored a partial
victory in his diplomatic battle with the United Nations, as the world body
bowed to his terms for the delivery of relief aid.
The US reacted with indignation to an accord, negotiated between Iraq and UN
officials in Baghdad, which would further restrict UN control, but Britain
and France were said to be ready to accept the terms.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, told the Security
Council yesterday that the agreement should be signed and implemented
'without further delay'. But he acknowledged that it did not fully meet what
he termed UN aspirations, and he promised to continue efforts to strengthen
the UN presence in Iraq.
President George Bush yesterday ordered the release of some Iraqi assets
frozen in the US to be used to pay for UN weapons inspections and
humanitarian aid in Iraq.
Reuter adds: Two days after Mr Bush had denied, in a TV debate, that US
technology went into Baghdad's nuclear programme, the State Department said
yesterday that Dollars 15m of US parts had indeed been found in Iraq.
