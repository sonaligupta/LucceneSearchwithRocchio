FT  17 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Lower overheads help Stanley edge ahead 6%


   By PEGGY HOLLINGER


REDUCED overheads helped Stanley Leisure Organisation, the betting shop,
casino and snooker club group, inch ahead in the six months to October 27
1991, with a 6.4 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 3.73m.
The improvement was struck on turnover just 3.6 per cent higher at Pounds
100.3m.
Mr Leonard Steinberg, chairman, said the difficult conditions of the first
half were continuing in the second six months, with sales in the casino and
racing divisions only marginally ahead of last year.
The casino division, which suffered severely from recession last year, had
shown a 'modest improvement'.
Cost-cutting had helped boost margins, although only slightly, he said.
The spend per head - which in 1989 stood at Pounds 100 - was beginning to
recover from last year's tumble and averaged about Pounds 90 in the first
half.
Stanley operates 17 provincial casinos, which contribute roughly 50 per cent
of annual profits.
Mr Steinberg said the group had considered buying the 19 Stakis casinos  -
which were taken off the block this week - but the Pounds 100m price tag had
been too high.
Turnover advanced slightly in the racing division, which includes the
group's 327 betting shops.
The company said about six of the shops were loss-making. Average bets still
languished at last year's levels of Pounds 3.39 but margins remained steady.
Since the end of October, Stanley has purchased 25 betting shops for Pounds
4m.
The acquisition has pushed up debt, which was Pounds 29m at the end of the
half. Gearing was just over 30 per cent, Stanley said.
Stanley's four snooker clubs continued to disappoint, and the group said it
was prepared to sell the businesses for the right price. It is believed the
clubs are making a marginal profit.
The group's loss-making printing business was sold during the six months for
a book profit of Pounds 347,000.
However, this was offset against a Pounds 1.9m extraordinary charge for the
goodwill written off on the business when it was purchased in 1988.
The recharging of goodwill through the profit and loss account is the result
of accounting standard changes introduced before Christmas.
As a result of the extraordinary charge, the retained profit was down
sharply from Pounds 1.72m to Pounds 195,000. However, Mr Steinberg stressed
that, in real terms, 'reserves have increased by about Pounds 2.1m'.
Earnings per share rose from 6.75p to 7.28p. The interim dividend goes up by
0.1p to 1.9p.
