FT  02 NOV 93 / Ex-MoD man 'acted properly'


THE CASE against a former Ministry of Defence official accused of accepting
'backhanders' from overseas arms companies rests on innuendo, Snaresbrook
Crown Court heard yesterday.
Mr Gordon Foxley, who led the MoD's ammunition procurement directorate,
acted properly as he awarded contracts for mortar fuses, rockets and tracer
rounds, said Mr Roy Amlot QC, defending.
He said the retired civil servant, who denies 12 charges of corruptly
receiving commission totalling Pounds 1.5m, had never 'pushed' for the deals
to be given to the companies said to have been paying him.
'If you are going to bribe someone in life, human nature being what it is,
there must be a reason for doing so,' Mr Amlot said. 'You do it to undermine
their integrity and loyalty and affect their position improperly.'
But in this case there was clear evidence that Mr Foxley had done nothing
'underhand, wrong or improper'.
On one occasion he had even recommended 'dual sourcing' to meet one of the
orders so that a company that the prosecution said was one of his secret
paymasters would not capture the market. 'What is the point of corrupting a
man who is not doing your bidding?' asked Mr Amlot.
The prosecution's case 'reeked of speculation', and suffered from an
'astonishing' lack of witnesses. The only live evidence came from two MoD
police officers.
The prosecution had sought to rely almost exclusively on documents. Nobody
had been called from the ministry, or the companies which allegedly paid out
money. There had been no evidence that Mr Foxley lived extravagantly.
The trial continues today.
