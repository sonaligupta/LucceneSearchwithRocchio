half

Email, the Australian white goods and building products company, yesterday
announced a 35.8 per cent increase in interim profits, for the six months to
end-September, to ADollars 45.5m (USDollars 34m).
The advance was scored on sales up by 26.2 per cent at ADollars 1.05bn.
Email said that the figures had benefited from an additional three months of
trading for the Dorf, Lockwood, Whitco and formed metal businesses which it
acquired in July 1993, and six months trading under full ownership of Email
Westinghouse.
However, at the earnings per share level, the increase was only slightly
smaller, with the fully-diluted figure rising to 17.4 cents from 13.1 cents.
All four main operating groups posted higher profits and sales, although the
large appliance division bore non-recurring costs of around ADollars 7m
related to the launch of new products and the rationalisation of
refrig-eration manufacturing operations.
The company also issued a bullish forecast for the second half. It said that
demand in all areas was up on the previous year, and it was 'confident of
exceeding the 1993-94 very strong second half result, based on the
expectation that the present market conditions continue'.
