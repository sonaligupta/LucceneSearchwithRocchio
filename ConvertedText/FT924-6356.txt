FT  21 NOV 92 / International Company News: Dell Computer's forex practices
questioned


   By LOUISE KEHOE


   SAN FRANCISCO


DELL Computer's share price fell sharply yesterday, when a Wall Street
analyst expressed concerns about the personal computer company's foreign
exchange hedging activities.
Dell was trading at Dollars 35 yesterday, down Dollars 3 3/8 , giving up its
gains on Thursday when it reported much higher than expected third-quarter
sales and earnings.
Mr David Korus, of Kidder, Peabody & Co. lowered his rating on the stock
yesterday. 'We have some serious and unanswered questions about Dell's
foreign exchange policies and treasury activities,' Mr Korus said. 'It
appears that . . . Dell's foreign exchange risk management practices may
have been unorthodox and potentially speculative in nature.'
However, he denied market rumours that he felt currency hedging inflated
Dell's third-quarter results. Dell Computer denied any improprieties. 'We
absolutely deny any accounting adjustment or activity being responsible for
our strong performance,' the company said. 'We have acted in accordance with
accepted accounting principles in all of our activities.'
Responding to market rumours of a Securities Exchange Commission
investigation, Dell said it had no knowledge of such an investigation and
believed the rumours to be untrue.
