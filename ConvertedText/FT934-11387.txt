FT  01 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: No benefit to housing market


   From Mr A M COLES


Sir, You report, 'Heroic assumptions and political realities' (October 28),
that there will 'probably (be) new restrictions on benefit payments to cover
mortgage interest'.
The exact nature of these restrictions is not clear. Nevertheless, it has
been suggested in other media that the role which the state plays in
protecting mortgage borrowers from the consequences of unemployment might be
taken over by private insurers. There will be three major consequences of
any such change, their severity depending on the extent of the reduction in
state support:
(a) An increase in the number of repossessions. It is inconceivable that
private sector schemes could be as comprehensive as that currently offered
under the income support regulations. Any saving on expenditure on income
support would probably be more than absorbed by increased expenditure on the
provision of housing to the homeless.
(b) An increase in the cost of mortgage finance, reflecting both the
increased risk of lending on mortgages, and the cost of insurance premiums.
(c) Some potential purchasers, identified by private insurers as
particularly vulnerable to unemployment would find it very difficult to
enter the market because unemployment cover would not be available.
At a time when the government is seeking to extend still further the groups
of people able to become owner-occupiers through its rents to mortgages
scheme, it is entirely inconsistent to be cutting back on the support which
the state is able to offer if things go wrong. More generally, with the
housing market remaining in deep recession, changes of the type being
proposed will have the effect of putting back still further any meaningful
recovery in activity.
