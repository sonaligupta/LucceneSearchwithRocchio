FT  29 JAN 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries advance ahead of President's
address

   NEW YORK, LONDON


US BOND market investors and traders continued to trade cautiously ahead of
President George Bush's State of the Union speech - due late last night -
although short-covering and a weaker-than-expected consumer confidence
report provided a boost to prices yesterday.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government issue was up  7/8 at 104
1/32 to yield 7.648 per cent. The short end of the market was also firmer,
with the two-year note up  7/32 at 99 19/32 , yielding 5.075 per cent.
Prices moved higher in early trading, thanks to news that the Conference
Board's consumer confidence index was 50.4 in January, down from a revised
52.5 in December.
The rise in prices was exaggerated by dealers buying bonds to cover short
positions before President Bush's speech. His address to Congress was
expected to outline measures to boost the ailing economy, none of which were
likely to be favourable to the bond market.
GERMAN government bonds ended higher on the day, shrugging off a sharp rise
in German money supply and strike worries.
German M3 money supply expanded at an annual rate of 5.7 per cent in
December, up from 5.1 per cent in November. Money supply grew at a rate of
5.2 per cent in the final quarter of 1991, exceeding the Bundesbank's 1991
target for growth of between three and five per cent.
The announcement yesterday morning pushed the Liffe bund futures contract
down from the opening level of 88.15 to 88.03, but then it picked up to
reach 88.40 by late afternoon, helped by demand for 10-year bunds.
Elsewhere in Europe, the Dutch government bond market followed the German
bond market's lead to close firmer. Tap sales of the 8.25 per cent 15-year
bond are due to close today, having raised a total of Fl 4.8bn since the
beginning of last week. Traders said demand for the 15-year issue from both
international and domestic investors was strong.
UK government bond prices gained up to half a point yesterday following the
German bond market's lead and sterling's firmness in the foreign exchange
markets.
However, traders said many participants remained on the sidelines ahead of
today's auction of Pounds 1.8bn of the 9 3/4 per cent gilt due 2002.
The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 climbed from its opening of
115 1/2 to 115 15/16 by late afternoon while short-dated issues gained about
an eighth of a point.
YEN weakness against the dollar helped to push Japanese government bond
prices slightly lower yesterday.
The yield on the benchmark No 129 opened at 5.25 per cent and closed at 5.26
per cent after trading in a narrow range of 5.245-5.26 per cent. Bond market
volumes were low ahead of today's 10-year auction, traders said.
The dollar continued to strengthen against the yen, reaching Y125.95 before
slipping slightly. The dollar rose after the G7 central bankers and finance
ministers failed to support publicly recent strengthening in the yen at
their weekend meeting.
