FT  20 APR 91 / Troops 'told to kill protesters'


   By VICTOR MALLET


TROOPS in Iraq's northern province of Dohuk were ordered to surround
anti-government demonstrators, shoot dead 95 per cent of them and
interrogate the rest, according to an Iraqi document made public yesterday
by the Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP).
The document, dated March 6, is a nine-point plan to deal with unrest
apparently issued by the province's head of security. KDP officials would
not say how their guerrillas had obtained it but insisted it was genuine.
The order says all Iraqi officers should report immediately for duty with
their weapons if they hear of demonstrations. 'In the event of opposition
demonstrations, close off all accesses and roads to these groups and control
the positions which overlook their positions.
'After implementing the above and surrounding the enemy elements, armed
force should be used according to central command instructions to kill 95
per cent of them, leaving the remainder for interrogation.'
There was an uprising in Dohuk - along with the rest of Kurdistan and much
of southern Iraq - in early March, after the defeat of the Iraqi army in
Kuwait at the end of February. But the Iraqi government had recaptured many
of the rebellious towns in Kurdistan by the start of this month.
The Iraqi order also tells commanders to return fire against any 'terrorist
elements' trying to protect demonstrators, and mentions a 'technical
department', assumed by opposition groups to be responsible for torture.
The KDP, meanwhile, said yesterday that large numbers of pro-government
Iraqi Arabs had been moved into Kurdistan as part of an escalation of the
regime's attempts to 'Arabise' the area.
'Kurdish homes are being occupied and in many cases looted and destroyed by
these tribesmen,' it claimed.
