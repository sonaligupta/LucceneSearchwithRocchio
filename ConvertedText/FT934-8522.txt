FT  15 NOV 93 / International Company News: Ashanti set for February
flotation


   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent


ASHANTI GOLDFIELDS of Ghana will be ready to be floated on the London Stock
Exchange by late February, according to Mr Sam Jonah, managing director. He
says that only a collapse in the gold price below Dollars 350 a troy ounce
could jeopardise the company's return to international stock markets after
an absence of 24 years.
He does not expect the gold price to fall that far but, if it did, markets
might not be receptive to a 'pure gold' company float.
Ashanti itself is reasonably insulated against gold price falls because it
has hedged about 30 per cent of its production two years ahead at an average
of Dollars 400 an ounce while retaining most of the potential benefit from a
price rise, says Mr Jonah.
Ashanti, which owns one of the world's richest gold deposits, had cash
production costs of Dollars 170 an ounce in its last financial year, among
the lowest in the industry. 'With a gold price of Dollars 350, Ashanti
shareholders are very comfortable,' Mr Jonah suggests.
The company announced in September that the Ghanaian government would
provide about 25 per cent from its present 55 per cent holding in Ashanti
for the float which analysts suggest might value the gold company at up to
Dollars 1bn.
Morgan Grenfell, the merchant bank, and James Capel, the stockbroker, have
been appointed advisers and Mr Jonah now says that Ashanti is considering
taking advantage of the float to raise new money.
Lonrho, the UK-based conglomerate undergoing a management upheaval and which
owns 45 per cent, continues to insist that mining is one of its core
businesses and that it does not intend to sell even one share in Ashanti.
About 5 per cent of Ashanti will be made available to the fledgling Ghana
stock exchange to give it a boost.
