FT  23 JUL 93 / Leading Spanish socialist quits


   By TOM BURNS


   MADRID


The drive by Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, to clean up his
Socialist party's image claimed its first victim yesterday when a leading
party figure resigned over his connections with a group of construction
companies, writes Tom Burns in Madrid.
The resignation of Mr Jose Maria Mohedano as secretary general of the
socialist parliamentary party has considerable novelty value in Spain, where
hitherto serious corruption allegations have had only limited political
consequences. Mr Mohedano said he had resigned in order not to 'damage the
party's image' and stressed that his conduct as a legal adviser to disgraced
real estate promotor, Mr Jose Luis Gomez-Pinto, had been strictly
professional.
