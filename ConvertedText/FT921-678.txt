FT  27 MAR 92 / Brokers sent for trial at Old Bailey


   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent


TWO stockbrokers, Mr Patrick Mahon, chairman of TC Coombs, and Mr Andrew
Kent, the firm's corporate development manager, were sent for trial at the
Old Bailey by City of London magistrates yesterday.
They face two charges of conspiring to defraud The Securities Association,
its authorisation tribunal and its appeal tribunal.
The first alleges that they made false representations about the
circumstances of a purchase by Rahn and Bodmer Banquiers of more than 3m
shares in Coastline Resources; the second, that they dishonestly concealed
the source of Pounds 1.7m capital lent to Coombs, and falsely represented
that the firm's capital had been increased by Pounds 2m as a result of a
loan from International Pacific Securities.
Both offences are alleged to have been committed to obtain and maintain the
authorisation of Coombs to carry on investment business. Bail was reduced
for both men, who were arrested in February last year, from Pounds 500,000
to Pounds 250,000 each.
