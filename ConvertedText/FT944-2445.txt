FT  16 DEC 94 / Manufacturing demand 'buoyant'


   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor


Demand for British manufactured goods is more buoyant than at any time since
January 1989 and more companies are forecasting higher output in the next
four months, the Confederation of British Industry reported today.
In its monthly trends survey for December, the CBI pointed to continuing
upward pressure on output prices, although the number of companies expecting
to increase prices in the next four months is unchanged.
Mr Sudhir Junankar, the CBI's associate director responsible for economic
analysis, said the latest survey showed that 'the manufacturing recovery is
likely to continue at a smart pace into the new year, with overall demand
improving to its best level for nearly six years'.
The survey, which covered 1,207 manufacturers between November 25 and
December 14, found that 27 per cent thought their present order book was
above normal, 19 per cent below normal, and 54 per cent normal. The
resultant plus 8 per cent - which the CBI considers indicative of the trend
 -was the highest since January 1989. It compared with a balance of plus 5
per cent in November and minus 19 per cent in December last year.
Export order books were also above normal, although the balance of plus 7
per cent in December was below November's 10 per cent positive balance.
The CBI indicator of companies planning to raise domestic prices was
unchanged: a positive balance of 22 per cent for both months. Some 54 per
cent of companies expected prices to stay unchanged in the next four months.
Mr Junankar said that a fuller assessment of inflation prospects would have
to wait for next month's more comprehensive quarterly CBI survey of
industrial trends.
