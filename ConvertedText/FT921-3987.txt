FT  11 MAR 92 / International Company News: Continental Airlines to add 71
daily departures


   By REUTER


   HOUSTON


CONTINENTAL Airlines is to add 71 daily departures between now and mid-June,
which will include 'significant international expansion as well as targeted
domestic growth,' Reuter reports from Houston.
The airline said that its Houston hub will grow by 14 per cent, with 31
additional daily flights.
Continental added that it will begin service to four new destinations in
Latin America and Europe and add capacity on many of its best-performing
domestic and international routes.
Its system-wide daily departures will rise to 1,385 by mid-June from the
current 1,314.
Continental said that it has started hiring several hundred employees in
support of the new schedule. While the airline has traditionally increased
service for the busy summer season, it said most of this current expansion
would be permanent.
