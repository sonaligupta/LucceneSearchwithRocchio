FT  21 DEC 92 / People: Alliance Resources


Norris Harris has resigned as a director of Alliance Resources, the
struggling US-based nat-ural resources company quoted in London. Harris had
been appointed managing director of Alliance in October following the
unexpected dismissal of chairman John O'Brien. Receivers were called in to
Alliance by Manx Petroleum, of which O'Brien is also managing director. At
the same time, directors of its main operating company in the US - including
Norris - filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11. O'Brien has since
been reinstated as Alliance chairman. Harris's resignation came as a
surprise to the Alliance board. He had filed a request just one week earlier
to run the group's exploration and production arm, although this had been
rejected by Alliance's creditors.
