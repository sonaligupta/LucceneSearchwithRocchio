FT  06 JAN 94 / Clinton tightens screw on Kravchuk


   By GEORGE GRAHAM


   WASHINGTON


President Bill Clinton will not meet President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine
during his visit to Moscow next week unless significant progress has been
made on US demands that Ukraine live up to its promises to give up the
nuclear weapons based on its territory.
Talks between the US, Russia and Ukraine on the nuclear missile issue have
accelerated in recent days, but White House and State Department officials
have been much
more cautious about the prospects for reaching agreement than their
Ukrainian counterparts.
In Kiev, Mr Kravchuk is said to have already been invited to Moscow by Mr
Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president.
US officials meeting this week in Washington with Mr Valery Shmarov, the
Ukrainian deputy foreign minister, insisted a deal of such importance could
not be rushed through just to fit in with the Moscow summit.
Senator Richard Lugar, who is currently visiting Moscow, said yesterday: 'My
understanding is the meeting will occur if President Kravchuk is prepared to
sign the non-proliferation treaty on behalf of Ukraine; likewise, the pledge
that all the SS-19 and SS-24 missiles will, in fact, be dismantled and the
warheads shipped back for destruction in Russia.'
