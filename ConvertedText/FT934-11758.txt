FT  29 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Invergordon gives way to W&M's 300p offer


   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE


INVERGORDON Distillers, the Scotch whisky producer, yesterday bowed to the
inevitable and recommended shareholders to accept the offer from Whyte &
Mackay, the UK drinks subsidiary of American Brands.
Mr James Miller, Invergordon's chairman, said the board still considered
that the offer price of 300p failed to recognise the strategic value to W&M
of the business.
However, control of the company had passed to W&M which, with its purchase
of a 13.5 per cent stake from Fleming Investment Management, had raised its
shareholding to 54.7 per cent.
'It is unfortunate, therefore, that in all the circumstances the board has
to recommend shareholders to accept the offer rather than remain in a
minority position.'
After discussions between Invergordon and W&M, the offer has been amended to
include a loan note alternative which may provide shareholders with an
opportunity to defer any UK capital gains tax payable.
Mr Chris Greig, managing director, Mr Geoffrey Whittaker, sales and
marketing director, and Mr Edward Pickard, finance director, who in total
hold about 7m shares, or 5.5 per cent of the company, intend to accept the
offer.
It is not yet clear whether any of the three, who are employed on three-year
rolling contracts, will remain with Invergordon.
Mr Greig, who has led the group since the 1988 management buy-out from
Hawker Siddeley, said yesterday: 'If I were to be offered an opportunity to
make a worthwhile contribution to the future of the group, I would give it
full consideration.'
Five directors, nominated by W&M, will be appointed to the Invergordon board
next week. Mr Miller said that he and two other non-executive directors
would resign as soon as they were satisfied they had discharged their
responsibilities.
