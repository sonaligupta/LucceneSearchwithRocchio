FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of Norway (2): It all depends on oil - The Economy


   By KAREN FOSSLI


NORWAY'S vast petroleum resources are both a blessing and a curse for the
economy. To say that the discovery of oil two decades ago has had a profound
impact on its structure would be a gross understatement.
One has only to look at this year's massive budget deficit to appreciate
Norway's extreme addiction to petroleum revenue or reflect on an earlier
economic downfall caused by plunging petrol prices.
Including petroleum revenue, this year's budget deficit stretches to
NKr39.9bn, allowing the minority Labour government to pursue an
ever-expansive economic policy aimed at shoring up the sags in the social
welfare system. Excluding petroleum, the deficit swells to a new record
NKr71.1bn.
Luckily, petrol production will grow by over 20 per cent to 1996 from a
current level of slightly more than 2m barrels per day. Thereafter, the main
reliance on oil revenue will begin to shift to one on revenue from natural
gas sales as oil production begins a steady decline to the year 2000.
It is only recently - since the green wave of environmental concern swept
Europe - that natural gas's future has brightened with the prospect of
conversion to gas-fired power generation from coal-fired power generation.
Even so, Norway has done nothing to protect itself against the possibility
of plunging oil prices. Official estimates indicate that a fall in the oil
price of just Dollars 1 a barrel weakens Norway's petroleum wealth by more
than Dollars 20bn, or by about 25 per cent of mainland gross domestic
product.
This means that the value of petroleum resources would become negligible if
the oil price plunges below Dollars 10 a barrel, as it did in 1986. With the
oil price at Dollars 18 a barrel, new oil and gas field developments from
about the first quarter of the next century would have to be postponed to
avoid large losses on investment.
It is only when petroleum prices exceed extraction costs that the economy
derives a windfall gain - and Norway's petroleum extraction costs are among
the highest in the world. So far this year, oil prices have struggled to
maintain a level of about Dollars 19 a barrel, and many international oil
companies do not foresee a change in this level over the next few years.
Norway's petroleum wealth has an estimated net present value of NKr710bn,
with the state's share put at NKr580bn, yielding an estimated return on
investment of NKr41bn in 1992.
When world crude oil prices fell to Dollars 8 a barrel in 1985-86, a severe
blow was delivered to the economy - which was already in a state of acute
over-heating - from which it has not yet recovered. Norway was forced to
devalue by 10 per cent to counteract a deterioration in international
competitiveness. The government then set out a three-pronged strategy to
reduce the economy's dependence on petroleum income by seeking to reduce
growth in private and public consumption while stimulating productivity
through supply-side reform.
Reduction in petroleum revenue slashed Norway's spendable real income by 9
per cent as tax and royalties from the sector fell to just over NKr18bn in
1986 from NKr52bn in 1985, or measured in proportion to total income, to 7
per cent from 19 per cent.
Export revenue from the petroleum sector was reduced by NKr30bn,
corresponding to about half the deterioration in the current account from
1985 to 1986.
This reduced the sector's share of gross national product to 11 per cent in
1986 from 19 per cent in 1985, although total petroleum production increased
to 69m tonnes of oil equivalent (t o e) from 64m t o e in the period.
The current account swung from a surplus of 5.5 per cent of GDP to a 6.5 per
cent deficit. Fresh warnings on the oil price for 1992 are emerging -
indeed, in this year's revised budget forecast the government cut
budget-based oil prices to NKr120 from December's NKr131 a barrel. Last
year, oil prices averaged about NKr134, due to windfall effects from the
Gulf war.
Nevertheless, the government revised upwards 1992 GDP growth to 2.9 per cent
from 1.9 per cent predicted in December and sees GDP growth of about 2.5 per
cent until 1996, lifted by rising North Sea oil output.
Overall GDP grew by 1.9 per cent in 1991, down from the 2.6 per cent
forecast earlier by the government. Petroleum production will expand to 129m
t o e this year, up 4m t o e on December's forecast, and will swell further
to 149m t o e by 1996.
But the government revised downwards last year's output to 118m t o e from
the 123m t o e estimated in December, largely because of a maintenance
overhaul causing a longer than expected shutdown of Statfjord, the biggest
oil producing field.
The current account surplus was also revised downwards to NKr26bn from
December's forecast NKr37.3bn, due to the adjustment in forecast oil prices,
but the government believes that net foreign debt may be reduced to zero in
1994.
The budget also revealed weaknesses in the mainland economy, which excludes
petroleum and shipping. Investments in mainland industry are expected to
fall 2 per cent this year and growth has been pared back to 1.5 per cent
from December's 2 per cent forecast. Demand for goods and services, however,
may rise by 2 per cent from 1991-92.
Cost competitiveness has improved by about 10.5 per cent in the past three
years. Also on the bright side, inflation, at 2.5 per cent, is lower than
that of Norway's main trading partners and interest rates have fallen to the
level of most of western Europe.
Households have improved their financial position and debt is being reduced
on a large scale. But, nothing is being done to reduce the economy's
dependency on petroleum income. On the contrary, petroleum earnings have
allowed NKr40bn to be spent since 1988 to stimulate domestic demand. This
year the government has allocated expenditure of NKr2.5bn just to curb
unemployment, which, at 8 per cent, has risen to its highest ever post war
level.
