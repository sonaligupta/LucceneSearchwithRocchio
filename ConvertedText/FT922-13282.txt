FT  13 APR 92 / UK Company News: Company News in Brief


CLASSIC THOROUGHBREDS has terminated discussions which might have led to an
offer for the company.
*****
INTERNATIONAL RESORT Holdings has acquired the remaining 80.1 per cent of
the EGP Sports group it does not already own for up to Pounds 760,000
payable in loan notes. Further sum of up to Pounds 800,000 is dependent on
EGP profits over the three year ending March 1995.
***** NATIONAL HOME Loans Holdings: Recent reductions in staffing levels has
enabled the company to move back to its original premises in Solihull and
grant a five year lease to British Gas on its 90,000 sq ft building in Homer
Road with effect from August 3. The move is expected to produce savings of
more than Pounds 2m per annum in rent, rates and ancillary services for NHL
which will retain its 125 year lease on the Homer Road site.
