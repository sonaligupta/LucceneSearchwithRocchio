FT  29 JUL 92 / Union is recognised at Law Society


   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff


FOR THE first time in its 170-year history, the Law Society, the solicitors'
governing body, has granted union recognition to its employees.
An agreement signed yesterday will give sole recognition to MSF, the general
technical union. It will negotiate on pay and conditions for the 600 Law
Society staff.
Those covered by the agreement include lawyers and other professionals as
well as administrative workers.
Mr Roger Lyons, MSF general secretary, said Law Society personnel worked for
'an employer whose very business is professional advice and representation.
Staff need an equivalent level of representation.'
Ms Jean Thomason, the society's head of personnel and training, said it was
the first time there had been a union claim for recognition. The move was
part of 'good constructive industrial relations'.
Last year the society suffered a Pounds 3m shortfall in budgeted revenue -
equivalent to about 8 per cent of planned net expenditure. The shortfall was
largely accounted for by a fall in the number of solicitors taking out
practising certificates for the following year. A package of cuts included
about 35 redundancies.
The union said yesterday that the move to recognition was not linked to the
cuts.
Ms Karen MacKay, who chairs the newly recognised union branch, said staff
had until now been represented by a staff association. The association had
gradually fallen into disuse because it was no longer an appropriate
structure - the number of staff employed by the society had increased
greatly over the past five or six years and the organisation had become more
complex, she said.
