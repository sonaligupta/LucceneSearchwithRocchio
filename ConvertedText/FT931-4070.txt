FT  12 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Packaging activities leave Blagden lower


   By ROLAND RUDD


BLAGDEN INDUSTRIES, the packaging and chemicals group, suffered a 29 per
cent fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 7.63m for the 53 weeks to January 3.
The directors said the the packaging division had been adversely hit by
recession. The result was foreshadowed in November when the group issued a
gloomy trading statement.
Sales improved from Pounds 218.3m to Pounds 229.8m.
Operating profits from international packaging fell from Pounds 8.6m to
Pounds 7.2m while those of UK packaging declined from Pounds 3m to Pounds
1.7m. The industrial protective equipment operations experienced a downturn
in profits from Pounds 852,000 to Pounds 677,000. Chemical activities bucked
the trend with a rise to Pounds 3.6m (Pounds 3m).
Net interest charges rose to Pounds 3.3m (Pounds 2.8m) reflecting increased
rates on the group's foreign currency debt. Borrowings increased to Pounds
34.6m (Pounds 25.2m), mainly because of foreign currency conversion and
increased capital expenditure. Gearing rose to 50 per cent (36 per cent).
An exceptional charge of Pounds 606,000 related to reorganisation costs.
Earnings per share fell to 7.2p (14p), partly because of the higher tax
charge relating to the larger write-offs of advanced corporation tax.
The final dividend is maintained at 5p making an unchanged total of 9.5p.
