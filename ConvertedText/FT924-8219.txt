FT  12 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Costain denies Peabody's 'bad faith'
allegations


   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent


COSTAIN, the UK construction group which is being sued for accepting a
higher offer for its Australian coal-mining business, yesterday strongly
denied claims that it had acted in 'bad faith and breach of written
obligations'.
Altus Finance, a subsidiary of Credit Lyonnais, the French bank, announced
on Monday that it had agreed to pay Dollars 245m (Pounds 162m) for the
mining business and Costain's remaining Australian commercial property
interests.
Costain had previously agreed to sell the mining business for Dollars 200m
to Peabody Holding, the US-based coal-mining subsidiary of Hanson, the UK
conglomerate.
Peabody, in a lawsuit filed in the St Louis circuit court, asked that
Costain be made to abide by the terms of the original agreement, and an
injunction placed on the sale to Altus.
Mr Peter Costain, chief executive, who is also being sued by Peabody, denied
that he had broken an agreement. 'There was a written agreement giving
Peabody exclusive negotiating rights until September 21. Subsequently I
agreed, orally, to extend these rights to September 30. Altus did not appear
on the scene until some time after September 30.'
