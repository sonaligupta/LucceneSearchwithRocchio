FT  20 APR 94 / International Capital Markets: HK securities watchdog to
recruit senior officials

   HONG KONG


Hong Kong has begun the search for corporate regulators to replace the two
most senior officials at the Securities and Futures Commission, the colony's
corporate watchdog, both of whom have decided to step down.
Mr Robert Nottle, SFC chairman, will leave the commission at the end of this
year when his contact expires and return to Australia. Mr Robert Gilmore,
his deputy, plans to return to the private sector next year.
Mr Michael Cartland, secretary for financial services, said the government
hoped a local Chinese could be found to replace Mr Nottle. The government
hoped to be able to announce an appointment by October this year.
However, if the government wants its candidate to serve beyond mid-1997  -
when China resumes sovereignty over Hong Kong - it will have to consult
Beijing on the appointment. At present, the SFC chairman has wide powers to
investigate corporate wrong-doing.
A commission spokesman said an international search would be conducted.
'Much of the chairman's work is focused on the integration of Hong Kong's
financial market with the mainland. An ability to speak Chinese would be an
asset,' he said.
