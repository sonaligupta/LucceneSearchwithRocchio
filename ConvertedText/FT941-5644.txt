   WASHINGTON


President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine yesterday won a promise of increased
financial aid from the US during a White House meeting with President Bill
Clinton, writes George Graham in Washington. The extra aid is a reward for
Mr Kravchuk's agreement to a three-way pact with Russia and the US for
Ukraine to eliminate around 1,800 nuclear warheads.
