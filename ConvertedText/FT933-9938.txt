FT  06 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Abbey ahead to IPounds 2.65m as dividend is
doubled


ABBEY, the residential estate developer, raised pre-tax profit from IPounds
1.55m to IPounds 2.65m (Pounds 2.49m) in the year ended April 30 1993,
despite an exceptional charge amounting to IPounds 1.15m.
Shareholders receive a dividend doubled to 2p, payable from earnings of
4.06p (2.7p) per share.
The charge covered two write downs - IPounds 630,000 at one housing
development and IPounds 519,000 on the valuation of an investment property.
Mr Charles Gallagher, chairman, said improving market conditions in the last
quarter led to the UK housebuilding side completing 508 sales with turnover
of IPounds 28.9m and operating profit of IPounds 2.8m.
The plant hire division suffered from the decline in overall construction
activity; it incurred a trading loss of IPounds 448,000 after the costs of
closing three depots.
In Ireland the Dun Laoghaire site had been sold and 28 plots purchased at
Monkstown.
