FT  19 APR 91 / International Company News: Texas Instruments reverses into
red

TEXAS Instruments, the US semiconductor and electronics manufacturer,
reported heavy losses for the first quarter of 1991, reflecting a slump in
semiconductor memory chip prices.
Net losses for the first three months were Dollars 54m, compared with net
income of Dollars 13m in the corresponding period a year ago.
Losses per share were 77 cents, compared with earnings of 5 cents per share
the previous year.
Operating losses rose from Dollars 2m in the first quarter of 1990 to
Dollars 35m in the first three months of 1991.
Texas Instruments' revenues were up 7 per cent to Dollars 1.65bn.
Higher sales of specialised semiconductor products other than memory chips,
was the biggest factor in revenue growth, Texas Instruments said.
'We experienced double-digit revenue growth in differentiated semiconductor
products in 1990.
'Our goal is to generate more than half of our semiconductor revenues from
this class of products by the latter part of the decade,' said Mr Jerry
Junkins, Texas Instruments' chairman, president and chief executive.
'During the weak semiconductor market environment, Texas Instruments
invested counter-cyclically in capital and in research and development, to
be in a better position for the market upturn,' said Mr Junkins.
Capital spending reached a high of Dollars 909m in 1990 but will be cut to
about Dollars 575m this year, he said.
'We are beginning to see signs of recovery in the semiconductor market, and
expect (it) will grow about 13 per cent in 1991,' Mr Junkins added.
Texas Instruments earned Dollars 76m in royalty revenues during the first
quarter from companies which have lic-ensed its semiconductor technology.
Profit margins in defence electronics fell slightly, while losses increased
in Texas Instruments' computer operations.
