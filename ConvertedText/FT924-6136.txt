processing lines, it said. These include instant tea, fish feed and
margarine. The company will convene an extraordinary general meeting in
Calcutta on December 23 to approve the proposed majority holding.
Unilon, the Anglo-Dutch group's wholly-owned subsidiary, will pay Rs105 per
Rs10 share for the additional 3.53m shares, Lipton India said.
In 1991 Lipton India earned net profits of Rs115.3m on turnover of Rs6.56bn.
