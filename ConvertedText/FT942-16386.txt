FT  11 APR 94 / Business Travel (Update): 777 unveiled


Boeing, the US aircraft manufacturer, raised the curtain on Saturday on its
new twin-engine 777 aircraft, the company's most ambitious development
project since the 747 jumbo jet.
Boeing executives said they saw the wide-body 777 as the beginning of a
'family of airplanes' that will meet airline needs for the next 30-50 years,
and maintain the company's worldwide 65 per cent market share against rivals
Airbus Industrie and McDonnell Douglas.
The aircraft is scheduled to make its initial flight in the first week of
June. The first commercial model is to be delivered to United Airlines in
May 1995.
Boeing so far has received 147 orders for the aircraft, which sells for
between Dollars 116m and Dollars 140m. Analysts have said Boeing needs to
sell about 300 aircraft to break even on the initial production cost, which
they have estimated at Dollars 4bn - a sum being shared by three Japanese
manufacturers.
