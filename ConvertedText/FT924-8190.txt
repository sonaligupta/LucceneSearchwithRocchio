FT  12 NOV 92 / Letter: Sentiments shared - so why not mentioned?


   From Mr HOWARD DAVIES


Sir, Your leader, 'CBI obfuscation' (November 10), takes us to task on two
points. First, you argue of our national manufacturing council report that
'the overwhelming impression created is that government action is both the
primary cause and cure for industry's weakness'.
We had not intended to create that impression, and hoped that by saying, in
paragraph 2 of the report, 'The primary responsibility for winning
internationally rests with UK industry', we had avoided it . Certainly your
point is well understood here.
Second, you appeal for an employers' organisation 'with the courage to tell
its members and their employees that they should put profits and investment
before increases in wages and executive salaries'. I agree, which is why, in
my speech to the conference, I described the 1967 devaluation experience and
said that what was needed to avoid a recurrence was 'tight control of wages
in the private sector as well as the public. Settlements have fallen rapidly
in the last two years but are still running at around 4.5 per cent. The
challenge now is to push on down below that'.
I went on to point out that 'senior management pay, too, has been 'sticky
downwards'' and emphasised the 'duty on management to respond to the
market-place and to the need to ensure that our economy is well-balanced and
delivers prosperity for all out people'.
Since those sentiments accord quite closely with your own I found it odd
that you did not report them.
