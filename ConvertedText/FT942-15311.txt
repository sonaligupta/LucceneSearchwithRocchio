FT  15 APR 94 / International Company News: Aga to spin off Frigoscandia


   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES


   STOCKHOLM


Aga, the Swedish industrial gas group, yesterday announced plans to spin off
Frigoscandia, the world's leading cold storage chain, and obtain a separate
listing for the company.
The move is in line with Aga's long-term strategy of concentrating on
industrial and medical gases.
Shares in Frigoscandia will be distributed to Aga shareholders in line with
their existing holdings. Each Aga A and B share qualifies for a similar
share in Frigoscandia, which will be listed on the Stockholm stock exchange
in June.
Frigoscandia had an operating income of SKr275m (Dollars 34.7m) on sales of
SKr4.7bn last year. The main part of its business is cold storage, transport
and food processing, but 25 per cent of turnover derives from sales of large
industrial freezers, where it has a 50 per cent world market share.
Frigoscandia's income after financial items this year is expected to equal
last year's pro-forma earnings of SKr204m. The freezer manufacturing
operation will benefit from the lower value of the krona, but the benefit
will be offset by EU plans to reduce meat and butter mountains, which will
lower the demand for storage.
Aga bought Frigoscandia in 1978. It said Frigoscandia had enjoyed
considerable autonomy since that time, but added that a listing would
increase the unit's financial freedom of action.
Aga is one of the world's leading industrial gas companies, with 1993 gas
sales of SKr11.4bn. After the demerger, the group's only big involvement
apart from gas will be a 34 per cent stake in the power company, Gullspangs
Kraft, which it does not plan to sell.
