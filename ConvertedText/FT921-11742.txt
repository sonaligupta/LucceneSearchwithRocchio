FT  30 JAN 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool


Auction sales so far this year have revealed no clear direction in wool
prices. Some finer merinos have tended cheaper, whereas broader categories
have been firm or slightly dearer. There is also continuing divergence
between better style wools and those adversely affected by drought. The AWC
market indicator has risen only one cent compared with a week ago, and is
581c. Apart from minor and mixed price changes in terms of the Australian
dollar, fluctuations in that currency, loosely related to the US dollar,
have also kept buyers cautious.
