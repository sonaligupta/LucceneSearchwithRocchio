FT  22 JUL 94 / 'Millions' needed to replace Swans


   By CHRIS TIGHE


Lobbying to secure a new multi-million pound regeneration package for
Tyneside in the wake of the probable closure of shipbuilder Swan Hunter
begins today, Chris Tighe writes.
Chief executives and leaders of North Tyneside, South Tyneside and Newcastle
councils, the areas where most past and present Swan Hunter employees live,
are to meet Ms Pamela Denham, the director of the government office for
north-east England.
They will stress that substantial new funds are needed to help the local
economy recover from the loss of shipyard jobs and the knock-on effect on
other businesses.
Mr John Foster, executive director of North Tyneside council, said: 'We are
talking tens of millions of pounds as a replacement package.'
The local authorities are anxious to ensure that the government offers
additional funds and does not divert money from existing programmes in the
region. Later today they will meet receiver Price Waterhouse to discuss its
plans for disposal of assets should Swan Hunter close.
Earlier this week the yard, which is in receivership, lost the refit of the
landing ship Sir Bedivere to Rosyth.
French-based Construction Mecaniques de Normandie, the only prospective
buyer for Swans as a going concern, has said it will only go ahead if the
government offers two years' work. Mr Steve Byers, MP for Wallsend,
yesterday wrote to Mr Roger Freeman, the new defence procurement minister,
asking him to meet CMN.
