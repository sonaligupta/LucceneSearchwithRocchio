FT  03 SEP 93 / International Company News: Ashley Grp returns to the black
with Pounds 1.6m


   By CATHERINE MILTON


ASHLEY GROUP, the window blinds and timber company, announced a turnround
from pre-tax losses of Pounds 4.9m to profits of Pounds 1.58m in the six
months to June 30.
Mr James White, chairman, said: 'Having completed a satisfactory first half
year's trading, the business seems set to progress in the second half.'
Turnover fell to Pounds 143.4m (Pounds 210.6m), including a Pounds 122.8m
(Pounds 192.2m) contribution from the discontinued Spain-based food retail
operations.
Earnings per share were 0.35p, against losses of 0.83p after adjustment for
the Spanish operations. The company, which passed its final dividend in the
previous 16-month period, is not declaring an interim (0.375p) but will
consider a final.
The window blinds division contributed Pounds 2.69m (Pounds 2.13m) to
operating profits on turnover of Pounds 19.9m (Pounds 17.8m). Ashley said
all its window blind businesses traded satisfactorily, bar Storflex, the
French business, which suffered from the depressed French economy.
Plywood and timber added Pounds 112,000 (Pounds 79,000) to operating profits
on sales of Pounds 713,000 (Pounds 601,000).
Net bank borrowings were Pounds 13.4m, giving gearing of 57 per cent.
Interest charges were Pounds 727,000 (Pounds 666,000), excluding a Pounds
1.94m payment on discontinued operations for which the company provided in
1992.
