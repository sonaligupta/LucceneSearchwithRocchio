FT  25 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: US withdraws from sugar pact


   By NANCY DUNNE


   WASHINGTON


THE US has withdrawn from membership of the International Sugar
Organisation, a body it once 'reformed' in accordance with free market
principles as a 'study group' with little influence over prices.
Launched in the 1960s to stabilise prices, the group has been reformed
several times at the urging of the US. It is now described as 'a forum for
discussing trade and statistics'.
However, US trade officials say this year's 'deal breaker' was over the
issue the contribution formulation. The US said it had to be made more
transparent and based on the relationship between the members and the sugar
market. The US was paying 9 per cent of the budget - about Dollars 160,000.
'The argument was that the poor countries should pay less,' a US trade
official said. 'We said everyone should have a stake in it.'
