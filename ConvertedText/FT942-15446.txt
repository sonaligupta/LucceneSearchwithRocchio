FT  15 APR 94 / Sainsbury ready to launch new cola


   By ROBERT PESTON


Sainsbury, the UK's biggest supermarket group, is about to launch a new
own-label cola brand called Classic - but yesterday insisted that it wanted
to avert a costly marketing war with Coca Cola.
Mr Tom Vyner, Sainsbury deputy chairman, said that the new drink - the first
US cola to be packaged under a UK supermarket label - will go on sale as old
stock runs out.
In the US, Coca Cola's regular product is sold as Coca Cola Classic. Ms
Penny Hughes, president of Coca Cola's UK division, has said it will take
legal action if Sainsbury infringes its trademarks. She added: 'Coca Cola
Classic (as a brand name) is owned worldwide.'
Mr Vyner said Sainsbury had registered the trademark Sainsbury's Classic in
1988, but had been waiting until the drink was improved before launching it.
It is being supplied by Cott Corporation, a Canadian company whose
supermarket brands have captured more than 20 per cent of the Canadian
retail market in the past three years.
Mr Vyner said there was no question of Sainsbury adopting the aggressive
advertising techniques of the Canadian supermarkets. Much of this makes
specific negative references to Coca Cola. 'We have a good relationship with
Coca Cola,' Mr Vyner said.
However Coca Cola may launch an advertising campaign this weekend saying
that it is the only 'genuine Coke'.
