FT  19 APR 94 / International Company News: Pinault warned over La Redoute
takeover


   By ALICE RAWSTHORN


Pinault-Printemps, the French retail group, has received a formal warning
from the Paris stock market authorities over the terms of its all-share
offer to buy out the minority shareholders in La Redoute, its mail order
subsidiary.
The Commission des Operations de Bourse (COB) announced that it had
concluded after an investigation that the takeover offer was not fairly
valued in terms of its relation to La Redoute's share price.
Pinault-Printemps came under fire three years ago from minority shareholders
over the terms of the Pinault group's takeover of the Au Printemps retail
chain.
It is extremely unusual for the COB to issue a warning to a company over the
terms of a transaction. The last time that it did so was in the
controversial takeover of the Yves Saint-Laurent fashion house by the
Elf-Sanofi pharmaceuticals group.
However, the COB is not empowered to force Pinault-Printemps to change the
terms of the deal as it has no authority to do so in the case of the
takeover of an existing subsidiary.
