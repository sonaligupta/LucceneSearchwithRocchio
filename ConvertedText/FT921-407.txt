FT  30 MAR 92 / Survey of Lloyd's of London in World Insurance (10): Many
sense that the market is firmer - The marine underwriters


   By LEE COPPACK


LLOYD'S marine underwriters are poised between the announcement of some
unpleasant results for 1989 and 1990 and considerable optimism for the
current year.
Starting in 1991, rates for most types of marine risk, hull, liability and
energy began to harden. It may have been too late to have a significant
effect on the 1991 year, but many underwriters believe the market is now
firmer than it has been since the early 1970s.
The last closed underwriting year, 1988, produced the largest ever
underwriting loss in the Lloyd's marine market - Pounds 609.4m - and the
first since 1966. Claims, including the loss of the North Sea drilling
platform Piper Alpha and reinsurance of the tanker Exxon Valdez, exceeded
premiums by 24 per cent.
Announcing the result, Stephen Merrett, chairman of the Lloyd's
Underwriters' Association, indicated that the 1989 and 1990 years were
already showing larger than expected settlements, substantial claims, and
pressure on reinsurers, particularly excess of loss underwriters. Rates had
remained soft long after the catastrophes of 1988.
While the market's underwriting profitability peaked in 1986, capacity
increased nearly 22 per cent over the following two years, until it began to
fall slowly from 1988.
Chatset, a private organisation that analyses Lloyd's results, believes that
the marine market could make an overall loss after investment income 30 per
cent higher in 1989 than in 1988.
Within the overall results some syndicates have made good profits, while a
few have had disastrous losses. In Lloyd's the excess of loss spiral
aggravated the effect of catastrophes. And for over a decade different
marine syndicates have needed to increase reserves for old years of
liability business in the US.
But the fundamental problems are not unique to Lloyd's and have affected all
marine insurers. They are, according to Stephen Merrett, inadequate rates
and a simultaneous deterioration in the claims experience, largely a result
of falling standards of ship management.
Over the 1989, 1990 and 1991 revenue years, the London company marine market
paid 62 per cent more claims than it received in premiums. While marine
reinsurance has usually been good business for UK-based companies, 33
reported a loss ratio of more than 300 per cent for risks written during
1988 after three years.
The mutual P&I clubs which insure shipowners' liabilities suffered a sharp
deterioration in claims starting in 1987. The largest of these mutuals, the
UK P&I Club, with over 20 per cent of the world fleet, reserved Dollars 618m
(Pounds 361.4m) for all outstanding claims at the end of its 1989 year; by
1991 the figure had risen to Dollars 839m (Pounds 490.6m).
An informal study by the Norwegian broker, Henschien Insurance Services,
last year shows what had happened. The daily cost of the hull and liability
insurances for a very large crude carrier (VLCC) with a constant hull value
of Dollars 40m had fallen from Dollars 4,181 per day in 1971 to under
Dollars 1,000 by 1990.
These calculations were based on hull rates from Scandinavian insurers, who
have been major competitors of Lloyd's. It is widely claimed, however, that
some Lloyd's syndicates wrote reinsurances for overseas competitors at rates
which allowed them to undercut London. Between 1984 and 1989, Lloyd's share
of the world marine direct market slipped from 20.5 to 17.5 per cent.
'They have given away their own birthright,' said David Lentaigne, managing
director of broker Alexander Howden Marine. 'Can they recover it? The next
two years are make or break.'
A drop in capacity internationally, including a near disappearance of
catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance, finally strengthened the position of
the remaining underwriters. Rates and deductibles have increased materially;
policy conditions are much tighter. Lloyd's own marine capacity dropped 13.5
per cent between 1988 and 1991, and some familiar names are disappearing.
On renewal for 1992, the Dollars 40m VLCC's insurance costs would have risen
to over Dollars 3,000 a day and the owner's deductible would have doubled.
Last summer brokers were unable to complete one of the largest facilities in
the London marine market, the energy master lineslip, on which many of the
world's largest and most expensive offshore facilities had been written. The
limit of cover for any one unit had reached Dollars 850m in 1988/9 (Pounds
497.1m), but last year even Dollars 500m (Pounds 292.4m) could not be
placed.
When the excess of loss reinsurance for the pool of international P&I clubs,
who cover the liabilities of over 90 per cent of the world's seagoing
tonnage, was renewed in February, the retentions increased, the top limit
reduced and rates went up between 91 and 144 per cent depending on the type
of ship.
'The collapse of the reinsurance market is a very healthy thing,' commented
leading underwriter Ian Agnew of the Wellington Underwriting Agency. 'It
forces people to think very clearly about the way they are writing business
as they know they are running their own risk.'
Although Lloyd's lost part of its share of the direct marine market, the
task force looking into Lloyd's future said: 'It continues to be seen by
brokers as the clear leader in marine and aviation, although in both markets
it faces intense competition from the company markets.'
Besides improving rates and conditions, marine underwriters in Lloyd's and
the London market took advantage of their stronger position to tighten terms
of trade with the aim of improving the cash flow from brokers. They also
introduced a new warranty giving underwriters more powers to require surveys
of ships not considered in satisfactory condition.
There is still competition on some risks, particularly cargo, though even
this often difficult class of underwriters has been tightening terms of
cover and not renewing the least profitable facilities. A few shipowners
have moved their insurance out of London altogether. There is still enough
capacity in other markets, but it means that Lloyd's underwriters are
refusing to cut prices to gain premium.
Leading underwriter Richard Youell of the Janson Green agency says there is
now more cohesion among the underwriters. He stresses the importance of
underwriters taking a market perspective which will ultimately work to the
good of their names.
'The concept of spread preached by members' agents means that many names
will be on most of the major marine syndicates; when they compete among
themselves on price, the member will pick up the business at the lowest
possible price.'
Marine underwriting years remain open for three years because it takes that
long for a fair picture of the result to develop. It will be some time,
then, before it is clear whether 1992 has marked a critical point in marine
underwriting.
Stephen Merrett thinks that the improvements may last a little while. 'I
cannot believe that the amount of money being lost will be forgotten
overnight.
