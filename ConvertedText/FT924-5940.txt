FT  24 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Anglo Irish held back by one-off charges

THE DUBLIN-based Anglo Irish Bank Corporation reported a 13 per cent
increase in pre-tax profits to IPounds 7.34m (Pounds 6.75m) for the year to
September 30.
Earnings per share, however, fell by 23 per cent to 5.09p as a result of a
1-for-1 rights issue which was completed in February.
Mr Sean Fitzpatrick, group chief executive, said that the bank had not had
sufficient time since then to fully leverage the IPounds 26.5m in new
capital the issue provided, and that a number of one-off costs incurred
during the year held back profit growth by a further IPounds 1.1m.
Interest earnings on the new capital amounted to IPounds 1.4m, while
additional costs related to the aborted takeover of Hill Samuel Ireland
(IPounds 500,000), redundancy payments of IPounds 400,000 in the bank's UK
leasing business plus a further IPounds 200,000 contribution to a
compensation fund by an Isle of Man subsidiary relating to the BCCI
collapse.
Mr Fitzpatrick said that the bank had performed well in its core Irish
market, turning in a pre-tax profit of IPounds 8.95m on a loan book up 46
per cent to IPounds 513m.
The UK division reported a loss of IPounds 1.61m, but risk assets have been
reduced to 19 per cent of the group's total, down from 32 per cent two years
ago.
'We have retrenched away from the UK market' Mr Fitzpatrick said, but added
that the bank's long term strategy will continue to focus on its targeted
middle-sector niche lending markets in both Ireland and the UK.
'We have taken the pain this year, and we have cleared the decks for growth
in earnings next year' he said.
A final dividend of 2p is declared, making an unchanged total of 3.36p.
