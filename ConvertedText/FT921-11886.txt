FT  29 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Expansion leaves Shoprite lower


Expansion into Scotland left Shoprite Group's profits lower at Pounds 1.11m
pre-tax, against Pounds 2.25m, for the year to October 27.
Turnover at this Isle of Man-based grocery and vehicle retailer and property
company rose from Pounds 31m to Pounds 45.4m.
During the period 11 discount supermarkets and a distribution centre were
opened. However, the opening programme was delayed and income was
insufficient to cover overheads until the end of the year.
The openings were financed by the Pounds 3.9m placing and open offer in June
and asset disposals. Gearing at the year end was 45 per cent.
There was an exceptional profit of Pounds 345,000, being the surplus on
property disposals less pre-opening expenses. Interest charges increased to
Pounds 1.29m (Pounds 942,000).
The proposed single final dividend is maintained at 5.2p from earnings per
share of 8.7p (16.4p).
