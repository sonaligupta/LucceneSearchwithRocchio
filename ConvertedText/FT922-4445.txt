FT  05 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Manila hits new peak as
Nikkei drops by 1.2%

ARBITRAGE-RELATED trading manipulated share prices amid thin volume
yesterday, and the Nikkei average lost 1.2 per cent as it fell through the
18,000 level, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei retreated 224.61 to 17,964.07 at the close, having opened at the
day's high of 18,182.26, and slipped to the day's low of 17,892.61 in the
afternoon.
Volume fell to 220m shares from 251m, as investors avoided the stock market
ahead of next week's quarterly expiry of index futures contracts.
Declines outnumbered advances by 659 to 246, with 173 issues remaining
unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 12.28 to
1,354.10 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 4.07 to 1,067.41.
Profit-taking in the futures market prompted arbitrageurs to unwind
positions. Traders said that some jitters over unwinding of June futures
contracts on next weeks's expiration day were alleviated by comments from
life assurers, indicating commitment to buy shares at cheaper levels.
The weaker yen discouraged some investors as it lost ground against the
dollar, in spite of continued dollar selling intervention by the Bank of
Japan.
Traders focused on bio-technology related stocks, following reports that a
government advisory panel had recommended the approval of imports and sales
of Didanosine (DDI), an anti-Aids drug from the US. Meiji Milk Products, the
most active issue of the day, rose Y17 to Y931. Ajinomoto, the foods company
engaged in DDI development, advanced Y30 to Y1,340.
Nippon Mining, previously sought on its development of an Aids drug, lost
Y14 to Y471 on profit-taking.
High-technology blue chips lost ground on liquidation of tokkin, or
specified money trusts. The sector lacked support from foreign investors,
who have been the recent buyers. Hitachi lost Y10 to Y790 and NEC fell Y15
to Y928.
Banking stocks lost ground. The issues are vulnerable to arbitrage selling
due to the low market liquidity. Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y40 to Y1,790
and Sakura Bank lost Y20 to Y1,090.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 156.90 to 20,665.38 in volume of 17.7m
shares. Roundup
A dull day in the region yesterday was enlivened by Manila, which set a new
record high.
MANILA rose on strong foreign buying and the composite index closed up
57.31, or 3.9 per cent, at 1,496.73. Market sentiment has been improving on
the likely victory of Mr Fidel Ramos in the presidential election. Turnover
was down to 235m pesos from 299m.
HONG KONG weakened on news that Hongkong Telecom was to lose its domestic
monopoly in 1995. The Hang Seng index ended 1.57 lower at 6,035.80 while
Telecom closed 25 cents weaker at HKDollars 9.15. Turnover was HKDollars
4.24bn, up from HKDollars 3.83bn.
SINGAPORE finished lower in dull trade. The Straits Times Industrial index
lost 6.28 to 1,507.44 as losses led gains by 127 to 75.
Banking stocks were firm on institutional demand while shipyard stocks shed
recent gains.
SEOUL eased in spite of intervention by the stock stabilisation fund. The
composite index lost 0.17 to 568.81 in turnover of Won196.6bn.
TAIWAN came off the day's highs on profit-taking; the weighted index closed
2.64 higher at 4,586.61, having been more than 40 ahead at one stage.
Financials were strong but many industrials were lower, with construction
leading the falls. Turnover climbed to TDollars 32.3bn from TDollars 28.2bn.
AUSTRALIA's All Ordinaries index shed 1.5 to 1,676.7, off the day's low of
1,673.9. The selling of stock to buy futures contracts boosted turnover to
ADollars 353.8m.
SA Brewing, which has proposed an ADollars 6bn merger with Foster's, closed
4 cents stronger at ADollars 3.12.
NEW ZEALAND consolidated with the NZSE-40 index gaining 0.94 to 1,582.52 in
turnover of some NZDollars 43m.
BOMBAY lost over 3 per cent on news that the police had raided three brokers
accused of using bank funds to purchase stocks. The BSE index lost 96.74 to
3,004.92.
BANGKOK improved but sentiment remains dull. The SET Index rose 5.30 to
684.82 in turnover of Bt2.77bn.
