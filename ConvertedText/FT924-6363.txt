FT  21 NOV 92 / International Company News: Minebea posts its first-ever
loss


   By EMIKO TERAZONO


MINEBEA, a leading Japanese machinery maker, posted its first loss since it
was founded in 1951, following heavy losses at its semiconductor subsidiary
NMB Semiconductor.
The world's foremost maker of miniature bearings saw consolidated losses of
Y4.9bn (Dollars 39.8m) on the pre-tax level for the 12 months to September.
After-tax losses mounted to Y13.6bn after special losses. Sales fell 2.4 per
cent to Y276.6bn.
NMB posted losses of Y12.4bn due to heavy competition in the semiconductor
market. Overall special losses surged 146.9 per cent to Y7.2bn. Losses on
inventory liquidation rose 43.1 per cent to Y2.4bn, while those on asset
sales totaled Y1bn.
The company relied on the stock market to boost earnings in the 1980s, but
the stock market slump forced it to book losses on holdings. Losses on
securities sales totalled Y45m, while appraisal losses on securities
holdings increased 73 per cent to Y2.9bn.
On a non-consolidated basis, Minebea reported a sales drop of 3.4 per cent
to Y200.8bn, while pre-tax profits plunged 45.4 per cent to Y8.2bn, and
after-tax profits fell 63.8 per cent to Y2.7bn. Next year, Minebea expects
consolidated pre-tax profits of Y5bn on a 2.2 per cent sales rise.
