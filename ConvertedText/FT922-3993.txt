FT  08 JUN 92 / Japanese accuse US and EC of widespread trade violations


   By ROBERT THOMSON


   TOKYO


JAPAN has accused the US and European Community of widespread trade
violations and of arbitrarily applying anti-dumping measures against
Japanese goods.
The attack comes in Japan's first annual review of unfair trade drawn up by
a senior advisory body to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry.
It accuses the US of the most abuses, at the same time as Japan's current
account surplus is soaring to record levels.
The report is a sign of Japan's determination to take a more prominent role
in the trade debate and is similar to annual assessments of trade barriers
by the US Trade Representative's office and the European Commission. Unlike
the US review, the Japanese report will not be a starting point for punitive
action against other countries.
'We hope that the report will stimulate discussion,' a trade and industry
official said. 'We admit that we are deficient in some areas, but we thought
it would be useful to define 'unfair trade' and look at the practices of our
trading partners.'
The study divided trade policies into 10 categories. It found that the US
was deficient in nine of these and the EC in six. Indonesia, Thailand and
Malaysia had a relatively good score, with black marks in only four
categories. The study excluded China, which would have a long list of
violations, because that country is not a member of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade.
Among US deficiencies was the demand for voluntary export restraints for
products including steel, machine tools, textiles and cars, all of which
affected Japanese companies and which were defined as a 'violation of
explicit Gatt provisions'.
The EC was listed for having imposed 'discriminatory quantitative
restrictions' on imports of 49 Japanese-made items. Italy was cited for
restricting direct imports of Japanese cars to 3,600 units, and only
allowing the import of another 27,000 vehicles through third countries.
In assessing 'unfair practices', the advisory body, including professors
from leading Japanese universities and representatives from companies such
as Nissan Motor and Sony Corporation, generally relied on interpretations of
Gatt provisions and international law.
It found that the US 'ignores commercial reality in favour of arbitrary,
mechanical rules' in bringing anti-dumping cases, while anti-dumping
measures were also allowed 'to apply to products that have not been subject
to an investigation.
'The EC follows many of the same practices as the US, and thus misuses the
Gatt and the anti-dumping code in the same way. In addition, the EC has some
uniquely European practices that exaggerate the proper scope of anti-dumping
law.'
Both the US and the EC were condemned for establishing arbitrary rules in
assessing the origin of products, a sensitive matter for Japanese companies
which have established foreign production facilities. The US 'frequently
abuses' conventions on this matter, and 'draft rules emerging from the
negotiations of a North American Free Trade Agreement indicate the strong
possibility that Nafta will impose origin rules that represent serious
restrictions on the traditional origin determinations'.
