FT  19 APR 94 / International Company News: PanCan lifts spending on
exploration

The Canadian Pacific group's most profitable subsidiary, PanCanadian
Petroleum, will spend a record CDollars 725m (USDollars 523m) on exploration
and development this year, including CDollars 600m in western Canada, said
Mr David O'Brien, president.
The emphasis is on finding more natural gas. PanCanadian holds the biggest
land base for exploration in western Canada.
Mr O'Brien said although the company's debt level was low, PanCanadian
preferred to grow internally because of the high cost of acquisitions.
PanCanadian is reducing its investment in a joint venture oil project in
Russia because production was not profitable.
The blended price available for Russian crude was about USDollars 13 a
barrel, well below the current world price for conventional oil, said Mr
O'Brien.
PanCanadian's total oil production rose 30 per cent in 1993 and gas output
was up 20 per cent. In the first quarter this year oil output rose 20 per
cent while gas was little changed. PanCanadian expects to report
first-quarter profit of more than CDollars 50m, well up from a year earlier.
