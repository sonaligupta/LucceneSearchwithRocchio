FT  29 JAN 92 / Observer: Innovators


Sir Kit McMahon has found a retirement interest which suits his intellectual
abilities as well as his experience of the financial sector.
The former Bank of England deputy governor and Midland Bank chairman is a
member of a proposed London-based think-tank on financial innovation. Some
Dollars 1.4m is being raised for the Centre for the Study of Financial
Innovation (CSFI) which should be operational by next summer.
'Financial innovation has been one of the main ways people make, and lose,
money,' says Andrew Hilton, a former World Bank economist and
director-designate. He has already won the support of the Bank of England,
EC Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan and SIB chairman Sir David Walker, for the
project. The governing council includes Euromarkets pioneer Minos Zombanakis
and John Heimann, chairman of Merrill Lynch Global Financial Institutions,
as well as McMahon.
