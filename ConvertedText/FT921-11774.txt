FT  30 JAN 92 / UK Company News: N England Building Society ahead 12%


The Sunderland-based North of England Building Society produced a 12 per
cent improvement in net profits to Pounds 10.3m and a similar increase in
lending to Pounds 297m in 1991. Assets advanced 20 per cent to more than
Pounds 1.2bn.
Mr Robert Linden, group chief executive, said: 'Our performance must be
among the best in the country,' and he pointed out that the Pounds 620,000
provision for losses was a figure that would be envied by many societies.
The number of the society's borrowers between three and six months in
arrears was only eight more at the year-end than it had been a year earlier:
1,066, against 1,058. The number of homes in possession was up from 47 to a
record 160 at the end of 1991, only 0.38 per cent of all homes mortgaged.
