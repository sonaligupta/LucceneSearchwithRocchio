FT  07 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Cassidy falls but sees better second half


Cassidy Brothers, the USM-traded toymaker, suffered a 24 per cent downturn
in pre-tax profits from Pounds 716,055 to Pounds 541,368 for the six months
to October 31.
Turnover declined from Pounds 4.35m to Pounds 4.02m. However, in early
October a 'flood' of orders helped 'ease the pain' of the slow business
endured up until September.
Sales for November and December showed an increase of 43 per cent at Pounds
1.65m (Pounds 1.15m) and with 'guarded optimism' the company said turnover
for the full year would be in the region of Pounds 6.75m (Pounds 6.26m).
It added that if that forecast was met, pre-tax profits for the 12 months
'could well approach Pounds 600,000' - profits for 1992-93 fell to Pounds
457,217.
The interim dividend is maintained at 0.75p from earnings of 6.95p (9.02p)
per share.
The company is considering the possibility of manufacturing a small range of
its high labour content merchandise in China.
