FT  25 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help Jarvis Porter to Pounds
4.8m


   By PAUL TAYLOR


ACQUISITIONS and improved margins helped Jarvis Porter, the specialist label
printer for the spirits, toiletries and pharmaceutical industries, more than
double its full-year pre-tax profits.
The Leeds-based group which acquired the promotional print division of James
Wilkes in August for Pounds 12m, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.78m in
the year to February 28. This compared with Pounds 2.19m a year earlier when
profits were depressed by a Pounds 500,000 provision to cover anticipated
rationalisation costs.
Turnover grew by 40 per cent to Pounds 39.7m (Pounds 28.4m) with Pounds 9.3m
of the gain attributed to acquisitions, including Pounds 7.9m from the James
Wilkes promotional businesses, which are market leaders in printing drip
mats and other promotional material for the drinks industry in the UK and
Belgium.
Sales and profits were also boosted by a full year contribution from Holmes
McDougall, the Glasgow whisky label printer acquired in June 1991.
Earnings per share rose from 8.3p to 11.4p and the final dividend is being
increased to 3.2p (3p) per share making a total of 4.7p (4.4p) for the year.
Operating profits increased by 63 per cent to Pounds 4.76m (Pounds 2.92m)
with Pounds 1.2m of the gain attributed to acquisitions and Pounds 700,000
to organic growth. Operating margins rose from 10.2 per cent to nearly 12
per cent.
Pre-tax profits were also boosted by Pounds 24,000 in net interest receipts
compared with net interest costs of Pounds 221,000 last year.
Mr Richard Brewster, chief executive, who joined Jarvis in March 1991, said
the results reflected the success of the group's strategy in focusing on
specific niche markets within the packaging sector.
The group ended the year with net cash of Pounds 3.2m which helped fund the
acquisition of two self-adhesive label companies, Dolphin based in Lewis and
Irwin Packaging Holdings based in Cardiff after the year-end. Jarvis paid
Pounds 4.6m in cash from its own resources for the two companies and assumed
Pounds 1.5m in bank debts.
COMMENT
Even excluding acquisitions, operating profits at Jarvis Porter increased by
24 per cent and sales by 6.5 per cent last year. The group is now the
biggest UK supplier in all three of its niche label markets, and increased
its market share in the self-adhesive labels market by 5 per cent when it
acquired Dolphin and Irwin Packaging. Further acquisitions are likely since
Mr Brewster says he has a list of 60 potential acquisitions in Britain and
on the Continent. Some 18 per cent of group sales now go customers outside
the UK and the group's involvement in continental Europe is likely to grow
as it follows its multinational customers overseas. The share price has
risen sharply since last autumn and now stands at an all-time high of 240p.
Forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 6.7m this year would give earnings of
14.1p and a prospective p/e of 17. This is a quality buy.
