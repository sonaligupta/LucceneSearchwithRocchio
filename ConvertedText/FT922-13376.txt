   LONDON


Nuclear experts from 13 countries and several international organisations
yesterday called for urgent action to improve safety at the 15
Chernobyl-type RBMK reactors in Russia, Lithuania and Ukraine, Clive Cookson
writes in London. They were meeting at the International Atomic Energy
Agency in Vienna to discuss last month's accident at the Sosnovy Bor reactor
near St Petersburg, in which a damaged seal caused a leak of radioactive
gas.
