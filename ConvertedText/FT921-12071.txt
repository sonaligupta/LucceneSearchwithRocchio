FT  29 JAN 92 / Lunn Poly backs down


LUNN POLY, the UK's largest chain of travel agents, yesterday backed down
from its instruction to its shops not to display the brochures of seven tour
operators as Pickfords Travel, a rival travel group, threatened legal
action.
Lunn Poly's decision to remove the brochures came after the companies had
agreed to offer discounts through Pickfords Travel.
Pickfords accused Lunn Poly of 'bully tactics'. It said it might proceed
with legal action if it did not get an undertaking from Lunn Poly that it
would not interfere with future Pickfords promotions.
Lunn Poly said it had agreed to return the brochures to its display racks
after 'frank discussions' with the seven companies - The Club, French Life,
Jetsave, Meon, Novotours, Seasun and Sunset.
