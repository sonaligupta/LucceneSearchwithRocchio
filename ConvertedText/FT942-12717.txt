FT  28 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Strong trade unions not a misplaced
objective


   From Mr LUIS ANDERSON


Sir, Your leader, 'Latin America' (April 18), argues that income inequality
in Latin America would best be tackled by reducing inflation and implies
that the call by Mr Lawrence Summers, US Treasury under-secretary, for
strong trade unions is misplaced.
On the contrary, there is a close link between reducing income inequality
and encouraging trade unions, since only strong trade unions will be able to
raise incomes for the low paid and so reduce income inequality which, as you
will be aware, is higher in Latin America than in any other region of the
world.
As you correctly observe, at present labour laws in this region are very
unevenly applied - indeed, it would be more correct to say that they are
seriously violated in many countries, such as Colombia, where more than 100
trade unionists were murdered last year in the course of their union
activity.
Mr Summers is, therefore, quite right to argue for strengthening of trade
unions as a basis for social progress in this region.
I must add that the experience of countries which have proceeded to
privatise their health and education systems, which your editorial appears
to advocate, has been a serious decline in the quality and availability of
services and the introduction of user fees.
According to the International Labour Organisation, this has had negligible
effects on efficiency but has caused a substantial worsening of available
indicators of the health and education standards of the poor.
This is hardly the best way to address social problems.
