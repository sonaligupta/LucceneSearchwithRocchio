FT  19 APR 94 / Observer: Trading places


Once upon a time there was a fine old City club called the Accepting Houses
Committee. It let in all sorts of riff-raff and changed its name to the
British Merchant Banking and Securities Houses Association.
Five years on and the increasingly international membership now feel that
the word 'British' is no longer appropriate and the term 'securities houses'
is a bit long-winded.
So unless there is a last-minute revolt at the annual general meeting on May
5, the BMBA will become the London Investment Banking Association (LIBA). It
seems only a matter of time before an American is allowed to be chairman and
this once proud City institution is renamed yet again.
How about the American Investment Bankers Club Abroad?
