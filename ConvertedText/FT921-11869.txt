FT  29 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow scores record peak ahead
of Bush speech

   NEW YORK


Wall Street
ALTHOUGH trading on US stock markets yesterday remained cautious ahead of
the State of the Union address by President Bush, heavy demand for blue
chips in the wake of good earnings reports helped the Dow Jones Industrial
Average establish a record high, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow was 31.53 stronger at 3,272.14, eclipsing its previous
all-time peak of 3,264.98 registered on January 17. Secondary indices,
however, were left out in the cold. The Standard & Poor's 500 finished a
slight 0.03 easier at 414.96, while the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter
stocks edged just 0.29 higher to 621.29. Turnover on the New York SE was
moderate at 217m shares.
As on Monday, the markets played a waiting game yesterday, with trading
overshadowed by the President's speech, which was scheduled for 8pm New York
time last night. No surprises were expected in the address, and while some
investors hoped for a range of measures to spur economic activity, others
were fearful that an over-stimulative package of tax cuts could revive
inflation and push up long-term interest rates.
The sharp rise in the Dow stemmed from big gains in a few stocks, which were
boosted by positive earnings reports. Walt Disney jumped Dollars 9 to
Dollars 141 1/2 on heavy buying as investors responded positively to
Monday's late announcement of a rise in fiscal first-quarter profits.
Procter & Gamble also shone, appreciating Dollars 4 7/8 to Dollars 103 in
heavy trading after reporting fiscal second-quarter net income of Dollars
1.47 a share, higher than the Dollars 1.36 earned in the previous year's
second quarter. Merck firmed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 153 in the wake of
stronger fourth-quarter profits.
Compaq fell Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 32 3/4 in turnover of 3.4m shares after
the computer manufacturer reported fourth-quarter earnings of 77 cents a
share, almost half the Dollars 1.51 earned at the same stage of 1990.
Sentiment was also troubled by a warning from Compaq that it expected more
price competition this year. Other computer stocks were mixed on the Compaq
news, with Hewlett-Packard down Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 60, Digital
Equipment up Dollars 1 at Dollars 52, Unisys Dollars  1/8 firmer at Dollars
7 3/4 and leader IBM off Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 93 1/4 .
Warner-Lambert shed Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 72 1/8 on news of a Dollars
2.21 a share loss in the final quarter, incurred after two charges to cover
restructuring. The company surprised the market by increasing its dividend.
Bankers Trust ran into profit taking on the heels of Monday's
earnings-related gains. The stock retreated Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 64 3/4
in spite of predictions from the company that 1992 trade revenues would
exceed last year's.
Lifetime forged ahead Dollars 4 1/4 to Dollars 37 1/4 on news that the home
healthcare group is considering to sell a substantial stake to investors.

TORONTO traded in a narrow range all session in moderate activity. The
composite index finished 5.2 off at 3,623.2, while declining issues held a
small edge over advances of 301 to 292. Volume was 28.1m shares.
International Verifact declined 13 cents to CDollars 1.26. The company said
it plans to offer up to 6m units at CDollars 1 apiece. Each unit comprises
one common share and one warrant, exercisable for two years, to purchase an
additional share at CDollars 1.30 in the first year and CDollars 1.80 in the
second year.
