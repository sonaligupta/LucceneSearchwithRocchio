FT  16 DEC 94 / Hurdles to open access attacked


   By WILLIAM LEWIS


Lack of publicity and a series of bureaucratic obstacles are to blame for
the lack of interest being shown in the government's openness code, says the
parliamentary ombudsman, William Lewis writes.
Mr William Reid, reporting on the first eight months of the code of practice
for access to government information, highlighted the steps individuals have
to go through. 'The sequence is sufficiently daunting to deter all but the
most determined seekers after information from going through to the end with
it,' he said.
Individuals must make a written request for information, another request for
a departmental review if the information is not supplied, and then approach
an MP before the complaint can be dealt with by him.
The code came into operation in April amid claims that it would open up
previously secret documents and research held by government departments and
quangos.
However MPs have referred only 24 complaints to Mr Reid, of which he has
investigated nine. Based on the experience of other countries, Mr Reid said
he expected to have received approximately 200 complaints by now.
