FT  20 APR 91 / HK boosts powers over boat-people

HONG KONG'S government plans to strengthen its powers to detain, screen and
repatriate Vietnamese boat-people by plugging loopholes in the law opened up
in recent court cases. It hopes thereby to underline its determination to
maintain a tough line at a time when the number arriving in the colony has
risen sharply.
More than 2,600 have arrived this year, compared with 916 in the same period
last year. This month alone has seen 1,100 arrivals.
Yesterday's legislation, to be debated in the Hong Kong legislature,
establishes the government's power to detain illegal immigrants from
Vietnam, whether or not they seek asylum or refugee status, and to determine
whether they are political refugees who qualify for resettlement or economic
migrants who should be repatriated.
