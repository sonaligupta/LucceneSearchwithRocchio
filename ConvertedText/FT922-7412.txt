FT  19 MAY 92 / Letter: Competition and interests of investors


   From R A MORRIS


Sir, In privatising the public utilities, the government aimed to introduce
a competitive element into these monopoly industries and raise cash from
investors. Now that the main utilities are in the private sector, one cannot
help but feel that the aim of increasing competition has assumed a greater
degree of importance than the interests of the investor.
This is most striking in the case of British Gas, where Ofgas and the Office
of Fair Trading have a role in regulation and development of competition, by
whatever means.
Surely the system of gas pricing could be conducted in a less aggressive
fashion, without undermining the confidence of investors. This would give
British Gas the opportunity to maximise its non-monopoly operations,
especially those overseas, to the benefit of the company, shareholders and,
indeed, the UK as a whole.
