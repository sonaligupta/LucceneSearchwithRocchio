FT  03 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Bowater


In marking Bowater's shares down by 4 per cent, the market revealed
extraordinarily suspicion of yesterday's cautious trading statement. The
chances are that it simply reflects straightforward reporting by its
scrupulously correct management. If the softer markets to which it referred
reflect a blip in US confidence and destocking in the European cosmetics
industry, the statement has little negative bearing on the future trend. If
the situation is more serious, Bowater is in a strong position to cope.
Rights issues have raised Pounds 857m for Bowater since 1987. But the money
has been spent on acquisitions which have moved it decisively into the
higher value-added end of packaging, while leaving gearing of less than 50
per cent. Group operating margins have increased by five points to 8.8 per
cent since 1987 despite the recession.
If the economic recovery were to falter, Bowater should regain its appeal as
a defensive stock. If it continues, its operational gearing alone should
secure decent profits growth. A lingering uncertainty is UK policy on waste
recycling, though any new legislation is less likely to affect growth areas
such as medical packaging. The tissue business also sits badly in the new
Bowater, but cannot be sold without its former US partner, Scott, having
first refusal. Given Scott's stretched balance sheet, a disposal may be some
time coming. Bowater can afford to wait.
