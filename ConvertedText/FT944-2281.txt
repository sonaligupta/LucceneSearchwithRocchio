FT  16 DEC 94 / World Commodities Prices: Cocoa futures firmer - Market
Report


   By REUTER


COCOA futures closed firmer at the London Commodity Exchange yesterday,
helped by short-covering and technical chart support. A bullish New York,
fuelled by investment fund and speculative buying, was also encouraging,
traders said.
The March contract closed Pounds 42 up at Pounds 973 a tonne, and just off a
high of Pounds 985.
'Short covering has been the main dynamism but there was also a strong
technical motivation,' a trader said.
There was little momentum driving the PRECIOUS METAL markets after a
lack-lustre morning and quiet start to the New York session, dealers said.
GOLD continued to edge higher, closing in London at Dollars 379.85 a troy
ounce, up 75 cents on the day and Dollars 2.25 on the week so far.
At the London Metal Exchange NICKEL's recovery from its early-week shake-out
continued at great pace with speculators falling over themselves to get back
into the volatile market. Short-covering and stop-loss buying fuelled the
rise, which saw three months business up to Dollars 8,890 a tonne before
trade selling and profit-taking reversed the trend.
