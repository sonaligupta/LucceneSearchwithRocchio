FT  08 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Rentokil makes Pounds 8m buy in security
services


   By SIMON DAVIES


Rentokil yesterday announced its first investment in security services since
the Pounds 75.7m acquisition of Securiguard in mid-1993.
It is to pay a maximum of Pounds 8m for Granada Group's security operations
held by Sterling Granada Contract Services.
Mr Clive Thompson, chief executive, said: 'We are saying through this
acquisition that we are happy with our position in the UK security services
sector, and that we want to expand it further.'
Sterling Granada had turnover of Pounds 20m last year, but was barely
profitable. However, Rentokil is confident that its performance will be
rapidly improved, through the reduction of management overlap with
Securiguard.
Securiguard has proven a successful acquisition, and remains on target to
achieve double digit profit margins within 2 years of its purchase. Mr
Thompson said he intends to develop the company into a 'major player' within
the UK, and analysts expect further acquisitions both in the UK and US.
Sterling Granada will have net assets at completion of Pounds 1m. Its
traffic and secure storage businesses are to be retained by Granada.
