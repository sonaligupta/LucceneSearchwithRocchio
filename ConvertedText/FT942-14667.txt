FT  19 APR 94 / International Company News: Record profit for Merrill Lynch


   By PATRICK HARVERSON


   NEW YORK


Merrill Lynch, the biggest US securities house, yesterday reported a 21 per
cent improvement in first-quarter profits, to a record Dollars 372m, or
Dollars 1.68 a share.
The firm maintained its profits growth in spite of recent increases in
interest rates, which have cut into trading profits at all Wall Street
firms. It attributed its resistance to the less favourable interest-rate
environment primarily to big increases in brokerage commissions and asset
management fee income.
Commissions rose 20 per cent in the quarter, to Dollars 868m, reflecting
increased investor activity in financial markets. Asset management and
portfolio service fees climbed 23 per cent to Dollars 444m, as client assets
under management at Merrill Lynch grew 13 per cent to stand at Dollars 164bn
by the end of March.
Elsewhere, the earnings picture was not as bright. Revenues from principal
transactions - when the firm trades securities for itself and its customers
 -fell 12 per cent to Dollars 667m.
Merrill said that although revenues from trading in swaps, equity
derivatives, equities, commodities and mortgage-backed securities were up
over the three months, higher interest rates led to lower revenues from the
trading of corporate debt, municipal securities, money market instruments
and non-US government and agency securities.
Investment banking revenues were much the same as a year ago, at Dollars
444m, as higher advisory fees offset lower underwriting earnings.
Other revenues - primarily investment gains - rose 72 per cent to Dollars
116m.
On the cost side, Merrill's non-interest expenses climbed 8 per cent to
Dollars 2.2bn, reflecting the rise in employee compensation payments, which
are tied to the company's earnings.
The share price climbed Dollars 1 to close at Dollars 36 1/4 in New York.
