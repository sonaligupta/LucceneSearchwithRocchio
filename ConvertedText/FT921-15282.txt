FT  10 JAN 92 / Algerian militants defy ban


   By AGENCIES


   ALGIERS


SEVERAL hundred Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) supporters marched chanting
through central Algiers yesterday, despite a ban on marches during election
campaigning, agencies report from Algiers.
The FIS militants chanted support for Mr Abassi Madani and Mr Ali Belhadj,
two of the party's leaders detained by the military last June when unrest
forced the postponement of Algeria's first multiparty general election.
The FIS seized a commanding lead in the first round poll last month and
appears set to win a parliamentary majority in the ballot for undecided
seats next Thursday.
The Tunisian government, alarmed at the prospect of an electoral victory by
Algerian fundamentalists has told its security forces to be on the alert and
ready for sacrifice.
