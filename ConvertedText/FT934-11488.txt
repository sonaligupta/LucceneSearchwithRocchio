FT  30 OCT 93 / Briefcase, Q&A: Tax credit on dividends


I HAVE A self-select personal equity plan (Pep). On my last quarterly
statement was an entry for a tax credit on one of my dividends. The credit
was given at the rate of 20 per cent.
I think the rate of tax on dividends is 25 per cent, but the last Budget
decreed that credit is given at only the 20 per cent rate. A Pep is free of
all tax, so am I right in thinking that this means there is relief at 25 per
cent and not at just the rate at which non-tax exempt funds can claim a tax
credit? Should my Pep have credited me at the 20 or 25 per cent rate?
The Inland Revenue was correct in paying a credit at the rate of only a
quarter (equivalent to 20 per cent tax) on your Pep dividends for the
present tax year, as against a third (equivalent to 25 per cent tax) on
previous years' dividends.
You are wrong in saying 'the rate of tax on dividends is 25 per cent.' In
the former chancellor's speech, printed in the FT's Budget supplement on
March 17, was the statement: 'Finally . . .I also propose to reduce the rate
of tax on dividends from the current basic rate of 25 per cent to the lower
rate of 20 per cent.'
