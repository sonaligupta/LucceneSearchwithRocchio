FT  29 JUL 92 / Panel rules on racist remarks in workplace


   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff


RACIST REMARKS by an employer to an employee can constitute unlawful
discrimination at work, an industrial tribunal has ruled.
The ruling by the south London tribunal followed evidence that Mr Mark Perl,
a manager of National Leisure Catering at London's South Bank Centre, said
of five black workers: 'I am going to see my black slaves.' He is also said
to have told a white worker not to resign, as management was 'only after the
blacks'. He denied the remarks, but the tribunal found against him.
The company was ordered to pay the five Pounds 2,000 compensation each for
injury to feelings. Such remarks would have affected working conditions, the
tribunal found, adding that the five 'must have suspected their jobs were
under fire'.
Mr Perl's alleged remarks followed the company's attempt to demote the men
to counter-hands. The five were dismissed when they refused.
The company said an earlier tribunal had cleared it of unfair dismissal.
The Commission for Racial Equality said yesterday this was the first such
ruling. It extends the definition of unfair treatment and is likely to
influence future tribunals, although it does not bind them.
