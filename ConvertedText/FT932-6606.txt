FT  27 MAY 93 / International Company News: Fanuc blames economy for 44%
slide in pre-tax profit


   By ROBERT THOMSON


FANUC, the Japanese machine tool maker, blamed a 44 per cent fall in pre-tax
profit to Y29.2bn in the year to March on the curtailing of capital spending
by manufacturers and the yen's appreciation.
Sales during the year fell 24.4 per cent to Y117.7bn, with those of factory
automation equipment 27.3 per cent lower and robot sales 21.5 per cent down.
Orders in the two areas were equally weak, though the company is hoping for
a 1.9 per cent rise in sales this year.
Fanuc, like other Japanese machinery companies, suffered from continued
trimming of corporate capital spending and by depreciation charges on their
own expansion of production during the late 1980s. Most Japanese
manufacturers now have under-utilised production lines and little incentive
to buy the sort of equipment in which Fanuc specialises.
For the current year, Fanuc forecasts a further fall of 6 per cent in
pre-tax profit to Y27.6bn, though the appreciation of the yen in recent
weeks is likely to put further pressure on its profits in coming months.
Hitachi Construction Machinery's pre-tax profits slipped 39.6 per cent to
Y2.7bn, but the company expects an increase in infrastructure spending by
the government to push domestic sales higher and create a pre-tax profit of
Y4bn.
