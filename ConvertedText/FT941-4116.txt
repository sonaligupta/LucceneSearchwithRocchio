FT  12 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Forte speculation


   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON


There was further strong speculation that Forte may be about to announce the
purchase of the French-owned hotel chain Meridien after a French news agency
reported the two sides were in discussions. Air France, which owns a
majority stake in the 53-strong chain, is said to be entertaining offers
with several other international hotel groups said to have expressed an
interest.
The rumour helped depress Forte's share price as the market fretted over the
possibility of a rights issue. They closed off 9 at 255p with turnover a
lowly 2.2m. However, analysts pointed out that a large proportion of
Meridien's hotels are operated on management contracts, with the equity
being owned by outside investors, a fact that would reduce the price of any
prospective deal. Should Forte emerge as the buyer of Meridien, it would go
some way to making up for the disappointment of losing the deal for Ciga,
the luxury Italian chain, last month.
