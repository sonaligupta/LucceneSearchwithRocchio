FT  20 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Advertising monopolies probe is a
farce


   From Mr ROGER FERNLEY


Sir, My first reaction to the news that the Department of Trade and Industry
has referred the bid by More O'Ferrall for London Transport Advertising to
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission was to laugh ('MMC to probe
advertising bid', July 15). My second was to cry.
My company, British Transport Advertising, is an interested player in the
disposal by London Regional Transport of its advertising arm. But this
episode, with its inconsistencies and contradictions, has now descended into
a Whitehall farce, with doors of opportunity swinging open and shut and a
couple of characters caught with their trousers down.
At the outset, LRT and its advisers, KPMG Corporate Finance, made it clear
to BTA that they did not want the sale of London Transport Advertising
delayed by a referral to the MMC. BTA sought guidance from the Office of
Fair Trading and we were told that our bid, if successful, would be
referred. So we withdrew.
I understand that Mills & Allen went through the same process and also
withdrew.
Given that the More O'Ferrall bid has been referred to the MMC, I am frankly
amazed that LRT and its advisers now find themselves in the exact position
that they insisted bidders should help them avoid. Something has gone badly
wrong.
LRT, its advisers and the Office of Fair Trading appeared to want to dodge a
referral as a pre-condition of sale. Only incompetence or inconsistency can
explain the failure to achieve this. Now, potential bidders, (including BTA)
which have acted with propriety throughout, are disadvantaged. Perhaps more
ominously, LRT and the government will never know what this sale might have
raised had other bidders not been invited to stand aside.
