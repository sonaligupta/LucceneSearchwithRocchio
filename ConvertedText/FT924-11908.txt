SWISS BANK Corporation yesterday said its pre-tax operating profit fell 8.4
per cent to SFr1.51bn (Dollars 1.12bn) in the first nine months of the year
against the same period last year, AP-DJ reports from Zurich. The result
excluded extraordinary gains.
Despite the lower dollar, third-quarter operating income rose 5.2 per cent
over the same period in 1991, the bank said, without providing figures.
