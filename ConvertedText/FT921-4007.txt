FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Government Statements): Increase announced in
Income Support - Pensioners


FIVE million less well off pensioners stand to benefit from the increase in
Income Support and related benefits announced by the chancellor. The
increase will cost Pounds 305m in a full year. The increases are Pounds 2 a
week for single pensioners on Income Support and Pounds 3 for pensioner
couples on Income Support. Half of those gaining will do so because of
increased entitlement to Housing Benefit and Community Charge Benefit.
Mr Tony Newton, the social security secretary, said: 'This is excellent
news, benefiting nearly half of all people over pension age. This increase
in all the pensioner premiums in Income Support comes on top of the April
increase in the premium for those over 80, above the rate of inflation, of
Pounds 1 a week for single people, and Pounds 1.50 for couples, which I
announced in October. By October, Income Support rates for pensioners will
be at least Pounds 5.75 higher than now. For those above 80, they will be up
to Pounds 10.70 a week higher.
'The increase announced today will take to nearly Pounds 700m a year the
total value (after allowing for inflation) of improvements in the rates of
Income Support and other income related benefits for pensioners since 1989.'
The cost of Pounds 145m this year and Pounds 305m in 1993-94 will be met
from the reserve.
