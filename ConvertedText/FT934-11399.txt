FT  01 NOV 93 / People: County Landowners' Association


The Country Landowners' Association, mouthpiece for the landed gentry of
England and Wales, has elected a new president. Hugh Duberly, who spent his
youthful days in banking, still retains 'a liquid interest' in the City as
chairman of the Pavilion wine bar in Finsbury Circus, a popular watering
hole close to Liverpool Street station.
His work in City finance ended in 1975 when Mercantile Credit, the hire
purchase and leasing house for which he worked, was acquired by Barclays.
Duberly, now 51, returned to take over the 2,250-acre family estate at Great
Staughton in Cambridgeshire and began his climb up the CLA ladder.
As president of an organisation representing 50,000 landowners including the
Duchy of Cornwall, the Church Commissioners and a number of Oxbridge
colleges, Winchester-educated Duberly believes landlords and farmers should
be proud of their 'custodianship' of the land.
At a conference last week he quoted an earthy passage from Emile Zola's
novel La Terre to explain the lure of the countryside: 'Once the land gets
you by the short hair, the bitch won't let go.'
