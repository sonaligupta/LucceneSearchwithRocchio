FT  28 APR 94 / Malaysia welcomes new media stance


The Malaysian government believes the British press has stopped writing
negative stories about Malaysia. This emerged yesterday in comments made by
deputy foreign minister Abdullah Fadzil Che Wan and reported in Bernama, the
country's national news agency.
In the strongest suggestion yet that Malaysia will eventually lift a
two-month-old ban on public contracts for British companies, he said the
lack of recent critical reports in the British media was 'a good beginning'.
'If the British media continues to be responsible in their reporting (about
Malaysia), there may come a time when we will consider lifting the ban,' he
was quoted as saying.
'If they (the British media) choose to do the thing we expect them to do, we
would reciprocate with the right things. We are sensible, practical and
pragmatic people.'
But he said the government would decide to lift the ban only when it was
sure the British media had stopped writing offending articles. 'It would be
pointless if the government lifts the ban now, and then the same thing
happens again,' he added.
Defence minister Najib Abdul Razak also said last week that Malaysia's bad
press from the UK appeared to be on the wane.
On Monday, the British high commissioner in Kuala Lumpur, Mr Duncan Slater,
said he hoped 'things would get back to normal soon' now that Malaysia was
no longer in the headlines.
