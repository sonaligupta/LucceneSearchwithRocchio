FT  26 OCT 92 / Observer: Dropped


Is nothing sacred at BP in its dash to trim costs? The fresh cut flowers may
have disappeared from the big-wigs' offices, the corporate jets sold off,
and the dividend has been slashed. But was it really necessary to axe the
company Christmas card?
David Simon, the new broom who replaced Bob Horton, has ordained there will
be no 'centrally-produced' Christmas card this year. 'The labour involved in
designing and printing the card and then gathering and collating orders and
ensuring their timely dispatch was wholly disproportionate to the value
added' notes a corporate memorandum on the matter.
