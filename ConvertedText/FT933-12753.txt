LSI LOGIC, the US semi-conductor manufacturer, reported record net income in
the second quarter, compared with a loss in the same period last year.
The turnround was achieved by increased revenues and tight expense controls.
Net income was Dollars 13.1m, or 27 cents per share, compared with a loss of
Dollars 5.9m, or 13 cents, in the same period a year ago.
The earnings were at the high end of Wall Street expectations.
Revenues in the second quarter advanced to Dollars 177.1m, up 16.6 per cent
from Dollars 151.8m in the second quarter a year ago.
For the first six months of 1993, net income was Dollars 23.7m, or 49 cents
a share, against a loss of Dollars 5.5m, or 12 cents, in the first half of
1992. Revenues were Dollars 346m, up 14.4 per cent from Dollars 302.4m in
the same period last year.
LSI, which specialises in Application Specific Integrated Circuits (Asics),
chips tailored for specific customer applications, said demand was 'healthy
in the second quarter with the US and European markets leading the way'.
'Increased revenues and tight expense controls were the primary reasons for
the company's improved financial performance in the second quarter,' said Mr
Wilfred Corrigan, chairman and chief executive.
'Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were reduced to 27.3 per
cent in the second quarter of 1993 from 36 per cent in the second quarter of
1992.
'Operating income, pre-tax income and net income were all at record levels
in the second quarter of 1993.'
