FT  12 APR 94 / Schools quango draws criticism


   By JOHN AUTHERS


Both rightwing and leftwing critics attacked the launch yesterday of the
Funding Agency for Schools, the quango which will distribute funds to
grant-maintained schools.
It will have full or shared responsibility for secondary school provision in
44 local authorities in England, and powers over planning and closures, as
well as financial monitoring for schools which have opted out of local
authority control. So far, 829 of 24,503 schools in England and Wales have
done so.
The rightwing Centre for Policy Studies attacked the government's policy,
claiming that schools were not allowed to develop their own character once
they had opted out. It said all schools should be made grant-maintained.
Mr Brian Sherratt, head of Great Barr grant-maintained school in Birmingham,
said the new funding agency could worsen bureaucratic constraints and
're-create the kind of bureaucracy from which grant-maintained schools opted
out'. He attacked as 'counter-productive' education department regulations
forbidding new schools in areas where there are surplus school places.
Labour described the new quango as 'the last desperate attempt to prop up a
failing policy'. It claimed only 187 schools had held ballots on
grant-maintained status in the last two terms, compared with 444 in the same
two terms of the academic year 1992-93.
Mr John Patten, education secretary, said the agency would allow schools to
'plan confidently on the basis of a long and secure future'.
