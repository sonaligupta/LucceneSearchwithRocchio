FT  03 SEP 93 / International Company News: Avon forecasts shortfall in net


   By FRANK MCGURTY

AVON PRODUCTS, the US cosmetics, toiletries and jewellery group, yesterday
warned that third-quarter earnings would fall short of its results for the
same period of 1992. Last time it posted net income of Dollars 53.9m, or 75
cents a share, on revenues of Dollars 938.8m.
With analysts anticipating earnings per share of about 85 cents in the
current quarter, the announcement prompted a sharp reaction on Wall Street.
By mid-session, the company's shares were down Dollars 5 1/4 to Dollars 54
1/4 in heavy trading.
Avon blamed the third-quarter performance on continued sluggishness of the
US economy, combined with the cost of implementing 'changes designed to
reorient and redirect the US business'.
The company, best known for its worldwide force of door-to-door sales
representatives, has nearly quadrupled its advertising spending this year,
primarily to support Avon Select, a direct marketing scheme allowing
customers to order beauty products by telephone, fax or mail.
'If customers would start to spend as a result of the increased advertising,
we would be fine,' Avon said.
In the second quarter, Avon's US sales gained 2 per cent on the prior year,
but pre-tax profit on the domestic side slid 7 per cent because of the
stepped-up marketing effort.
However, the company is optimistic that sales and earnings will improve
during the remainder of the year, and expects fourth-quarter and full-year
results to show increases over comparable periods of 1992.
