FT  07 MAR 94 / Benefits checks may go to tender


Accountancy firm KPMG Peat Marwick has sent Mr David Hunt, employment
secretary, a report which may result in the work of the Employment Service's
benefits fraud inspectorate being put out to tender.
The work is the latest section of the service, which is part of the
employment department, to be market tested.
The report looks at the suitability of market testing for 1994-95, and will
be considered by the government over the next few weeks.
