FT  27 JAN 94 / Observer: Sweet sorrows


There is little more than a fortnight to go before the start of the Winter
Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway, but one band of merrymakers familiar from
the Albertville and Barcelona games will sadly not be there.
The men - and women - from Mars have failed to reach satisfactory terms with
the International Olympic Committee to continue Mars' sponsorship of the
Olympics. Mars stumped up about Dollars 25m to be a main sponsor of 1992's
Albertville and Barcelona games. The starting price for major sponsors -
such as Coca-Cola - which have stayed the course for Lillehammer 1994 and
Atlanta 1996 has risen to Dollars 40m.
The IOC says its split with Mars was 'amicable'. But - sotto voce - the IOC,
uneasily riding the two unrelated horses of commercialism and athleticism,
was not overjoyed with Mars' desire to repeat its Barcelona antics - hordes
of Mars employees swamping the Olympic village handing out sweeties to
everything that moves.
Perish the thought that Coke should try to do the same when the Olympics
hits its home town of Atlanta in 1996.
