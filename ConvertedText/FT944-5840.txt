FT  01 DEC 94 / International Company News: Caltex and Ampol may merge
operations

Pioneer International, the Australian building materials group, announced
yesterday that it was in talks with Caltex Australia, whose ultimate joint
owners are Chevron and Texaco, the US oil companies, about the possible
merger of the groups' petroleum refining and marketing operations.
Pioneer International owns the Ampol petroleum business in Australia.
Speculation that the two groups would combine these operations has
circulated for some time. They are the two smallest groups in the
five-company retail petroleum market, and competitive pressures in the
sector have been strong. If the deal proceeds, the merged operation would be
larger than that of Shell Australia, the existing leader in this market.
Both companies said that no agreement had yet been reached and that
'discussions are progressing . . . to examine the various issues involved'.
However, news of the talks brought speedy intervention by the Trade
Practices Commission, Australia's competition watchdog.
The TPC said it would make preliminary inquiries to ascertain whether the
merger would be anti-competitive, and if so, whether public benefit would
outweigh this detriment.
Both Caltex Australia and Pioneer's Ampol division have seen profits
squeezed recently by falling oil prices, deteriorating refiner margins and
retail petrol discounting.
In the year to end-June, Pioneer's petroleum division reported static sales
of ADollars 2.83bn, while operating profits fell from ADollars 194.1m to
ADollars 143.8m (USDollars 109.2m). However, at the time of those results,
the company also predicted a better outcome in 1994-95.
In the six months to end June, Caltex Australia saw profits of ADollars
19.8m after tax, down from ADollars 35.4m, while sales dipped from ADollars
1.71bn to ADollars 1.66bn.
