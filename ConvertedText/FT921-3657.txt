FT  13 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: United Biscuits


Another food manufacturer, another dividend safely in the bag. Yesterday's 8
per cent increase in pre-tax profits from United Biscuits was certainly
better than the market expected from a tough year, the more so because UB
made a novel Pounds 3m provision against US healthcare liabilities.
By clever marketing, UB made ground in its main businesses, notably at
Terrys where profits defied a collapse in demand for boxed chocolates.
Rationalisation of Ross Young's is almost over, so profits there should
bounce once the frozen food market improves. The group looks set for another
solid, if unspectacular year, an outlook fully reflected by a multiple in
line with the market average.
A footnote to the debate over brand valuations: UB sold Ross Young's
catering wholesale business, in the process writing nearly Pounds 13m off
its balance sheet intangible assets. It bought and valued the brand a mere
four years ago.
