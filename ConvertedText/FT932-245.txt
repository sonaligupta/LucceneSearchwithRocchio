FT  30 JUN 93 / Germany may introduce legislation on waste


   By ARIANE GENILLARD


   BONN


GERMANY intends to introduce legislation to allow domestic and industrial
waste to be incinerated if recycling is too costly, according to Mr Thomas
Rummler, a director responsible for waste disposal at the environment
ministry, writes Ariane Genillard in Bonn. At present there are severe
restrictions on incineration. Mr Rummler said new legislation would foresee
the construction of incineration plants.
He was speaking at a conference on waste management jointly organised by the
Financial Times and the Boston Consulting Group.
Germany's environmental policies have recently been under renewed attack
from leading industrial lobbies. They are complaining that waste disposal
laws place an unfair burden on businesses struggling against recession and
intense foreign competition.
Germany has some of the strictest environmental laws in Europe, insisting
that products must be recycled if possible. There is also a draft bill which
would force manufacturers to take back durable consumer goods like
electronic and white goods and recycle the materials.
Industrialists at the conference raised questions on the validity of the
German approach to 'recycle at all costs'. Computer manufacturers, for
example, argue that energy recovery, such as burning plastics and using the
resulting heat for cement kilns, is a viable alternative to recycling.
France, Denmark and Belgium are currently using such incineration methods.
