FT  15 DEC 94 / Observer: On the Wild side


So 'Wild' Bill Buford, editor of the London-based quarterly publication
Granta, is defecting to the New Yorker magazine as its literary and fiction
editor. Judging by the sounds of lamentation and rending of garments
emanating from British literary circles yesterday, anyone would have thought
the chancellor had slapped top-rate VAT on books.
It was 15 years ago that the flamboyant American took on Granta, then an
ailing Cambridge undergraduate periodical, and turned it into a vital forum
for the best in new writing, from fiction to reportage and travel writing,
with a circulation of 95,000.
Described by one former colleague as 'an exasperating genius', Buford is
very much the hands-on editor - wielding, his contributors would say, a
machete rather than a more delicate instrument. His own book, Among the
Thugs, by the way, is a study of British football hooligans - not a
confession of his professional modus vivendi.
In latter years, though, Granta had lost some of its ability to surprise and
many of its regular contributors - Salman Rushdie, Martin Amis, Hanif
Kureishi and Julian Barnes - are now established columnists on the more
lucrative New Yorker. 'He's following the market really,' is how Kureishi
puts it.
While Granta without Buford is hard enough to imagine, Buford with a boss is
a yet more challenging concept. But no doubt Tina Brown, the New Yorker's
fierce British editor, will know when to put the boot in.
