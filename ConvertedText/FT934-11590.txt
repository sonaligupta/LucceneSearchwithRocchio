FT  30 OCT 93 / International Company News: JAL forced to revise forecast


   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO


JAL, Japan's largest airline, yesterday reported a substantial deterioration
in its first-half performance and passed its interim dividend. It also
revised its forecast for the full year, citing a difficult business outlook.
The airline blamed the recession, a strong rise in the yen, and an unusually
cold summer, which kept Japanese people at home.
Its international passenger traffic declined, compared with the same period
last year, while demand dropped for cargo exports to Europe and the US.
The drop in revenue was also a result of intense price competition, which
the company has been trying to combat with a belated attempt to introduce
frequent-flyer incentives.
Flight operations were also adjusted to meet changed demand. New package
tours and new traveller services were introduced.
Despite JAL efforts to build up its domestic passenger base, the number of
domestic passengers carried rose just 0.1 per cent compared with the same
period last year.
Overall, the airline was unable to introduce sufficient measures to offset
the fall in demand and price competition from other airlines.
'This year we regarded as crucial for our survival,' JAL said. It added that
the operating environment would get tougher and competition would increase.
There were no signs of recovery in demand for air travel.
The airline is implementing a survival plan to cut costs.
