FT  28 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Skoda pins hope on new model


   By VINCENT BOLAND


   PRAGUE


Skoda Automobilova, the Czech car maker which is part of the Volkswagen
group, is hopeful that the launch of its new Felicia model, due to roll off
assembly lines in November, will help revive the company's flagging
fortunes.
Volkswagen, which is due to increase its stake from 31 per cent to 70 per
cent next year, hopes so too.
The company expects to produce 11,000 Felicias by the end of the year and
new assembly lines are currently being installed at its main manufacturing
plant at Mlada Boleslav, north of Prague.
The company's production of the Favorit model, introduced in 1988, ended
earlier this month.
A management and labour dispute over Skoda's plans to lay off 800 workers
could still threaten the timetable for the launch of the Felicia.
The unions remain on strike alert while negotiations continue to try to
resolve the issue.
Skoda made a loss of Kc4.26bn (Dollars 152m) last year on revenues of
Kc35bn, and further losses are expected this year as a result of the fall in
production due to the change of model. After producing 220,000 cars last
year production is expected to fall to 180,000 this year before rising next
year to 1993 levels.
The company is trying to reduce its dependency on the domestic market, where
customers have increasingly preferred to purchase western car models in the
last two years as incomes and spending power among Czechs has risen. Skoda
is targeting new markets in Latin America and South-East Asia. Outside the
Czech Republic, Skoda's main markets are Germany, Poland, Greece, the UK and
Israel.
The company has signed up new distributors in China, North Korea and the
countries of the former Soviet Union in an effort to expand sales in those
markets.
