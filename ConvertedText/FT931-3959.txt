protesters

   CARACAS


VENEZUELA'S presidential guards fired shots into the air yesterday to
disperse a group of about 50 anti-government protesters after they clashed
with supporters of President Carlos Andres Perez outside the capital, Reuter
reports from Caracas.
The shots, fired just minutes before Mr Perez left Congress following his
state of the nation address, caused protesters and bystanders alike to flee
down side streets or throw themselves to the ground.
No one was injured, but police held three protesters.
The protesters were shouting slogans in support of Lt Col Hugo Chavez Frias,
in jail for leading an attempt to topple the Perez government on February 4
1992.
The guards opened fire when a rock struck one of the escort cars in the
presidential motorcade, but the incident was over in about 10 minutes.
Mr Pe 13/32 rez left without incident a few minutes later and returned to
the Miraflores Palace just three blocks away.
