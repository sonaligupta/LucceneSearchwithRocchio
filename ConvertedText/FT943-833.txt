FT  27 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: News Corp seeks ruling on
Pearson convertibles


   By CONNER MIDDELMANN


News Corporation, the media group, is taking legal action against merchant
bank J Henry Schroder Wagg over preference shares and convertible bonds
issued by News.
The dispute stemmed from confusion over the conversion terms of the issues,
which were convertible into shares owned by News in Pearson, owner of the
Financial Times.
Several investors, including Schroder, incurred significant losses and asked
for the matter to be brought to the City Disputes Panel but News chose to
take the matter to the High Court to obtain a 'declaratory judgment' ruling
the bank has no grounds for compensation.
Schroder does not consider the courts to be the appropriate forum for the
dispute and wants the matter to be brought before the disputes panel.
News Corp said that it 'decided to take steps . . . to have the matter
resolved by the most appropriate and comprehensive means and, accordingly,
has commenced proceedings against a claimant whose claim raises many issues
common to those of other claimants for a declaration that it has no
liability in respect of that claim'.
The Schroder claim was selected 'as suitable subject for proceedings . . .
because it raises more issues common to claims made by investors than any
other claim'.
