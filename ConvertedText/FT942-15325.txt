FT  15 APR 94 / International Company News: Axa upbeat after 31.8% increase
for year

Axa, the second largest French insurer, yesterday announced a return to
profits growth last year with a 31.8 per cent increase in net profits to
FFr2.04bn (Dollars 340m) in 1993 from FFr1.55bn in 1992.
Mr Claude Bebear, chairman, said that the group was on course for further
growth this year.
In the early 1990s Axa was destabilised by the intensely competitive
condition of the French insurance industry and by the problems of The
Equitable, its US associate into which it injected Dollars 400m of new
capital last year.
Mr Bebear said the group benefited from an improvement in its core French
insurance business. Axa, like France's other large insurers, was able to
alleviate the pressure on profitability by raising tariffs.
The group was also buoyed by a recovery at The Equitable, a strong
performance from its reinsurance interests and by a reduction in the losses
of Axa Marine Aviation Transports, its transport subsidiary.
The board proposed raising the dividend to FFr25 in 1993 from FFr23 in 1992.
Axa's group turnover rose by 48.8 per cent to FFr126.28bn in 1993 from
FFr84.87bn in 1992.
Attributable profits from insurance also increased by 48 per cent to
FFr1.54bn from FFr1.04bn over the same period.
Reinsurance profits more than doubled to FFr172m from FFr69m. The
contribution from financial services and property fell to FFr717m from
FFr785m, in spite of the return to the black of Meeschaert Rousselle, the
group's stockbroking unit, which made a net profit of FFr33m against a
FFr20m loss in 1992.
Mr Bebear anticipated 'continued growth in Axa's profits for 1994 unless
there is an exceptional event'. He described the first quarter of the year
as 'very satisfying' for Axa in France.
