FT  01 NOV 93 / Exporters cool on rejoining ERM


TWO-THIRDS of exporters do not believe their export sales would benefit if
Britain rejoined the European exchange rate mechanism, Barclays Commercial
Services and Export Times say in a survey.
Most exporters also believe that allowing the newly democratised east
European states to join the EC would improve their sales abroad.
