It seems that The Riff Raff Element (10.00 BBC1) cannot be kept off our
screens. This new six-part series begins immediately after the end of the
last one - with the pressing problem of Vincent's corpse. 'My characters are
all based on people I've come across. I don't make anything up,' says Debbie
Horsfield, whose comedy of class has been hailed as a pretty classy comedy.
Home Front (8.30 BBC2) starts a series about interior design; tonight we
travel the silk route in pursuit of - well, silk, I guess. But whatever you
do pay attention to Very Jean Muir (8.00 C4), the second film in this
(repeated) series of three. Miss Muir is still very reluctant to call
herself a dress designer but the frocks she fashions to her own daunting
standards are perfect for grown-up women aged anywhere between 20 and 80.
Incredibly, Joan Littlewood is 80 this year: still as sharp and funny and
outrageous as when she produced Oh, What A Lovely War] and Fings Ain't What
They Used to Be at the Theatre Royal in London's Stratford East in the 1950s
and 1960s. Omnibus (11.00 BBC1) wishes her many happy returns, and so do I.
