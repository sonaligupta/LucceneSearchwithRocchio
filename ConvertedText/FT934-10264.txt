FT  06 NOV 93 / Wyvern Crest to lose to new EC directive


   By JIMMY BURNS and STEWART DALBY


WYVERN CREST, a supplier of business books by mail order, is among the
companies which believe they have much to lose from the proposed EC
directive, Jimmy Burns and Stewart Dalby write.
Mr Michael Herbert, managing director, yesterday called the directive
'mind-bogglingly inappropriate'.
The company, which is based in Ely, Cambridgeshire, trades as Wyvern
Business Library. It is a small concern with a growing client base in
mainland Europe where it makes more than 20 per cent of its sales. It
insists that all overseas customers and many UK ones pay for books with
their order. The company sells more than 100,000 books a year and half of
its turnover is on a cash-with-order basis.
Mr Herbert believes the directive would have a 'devastating effect', cutting
profits and undermining advertising strategy, which operates on very narrow
margins.
'The directive would mean killing a viable economic activity by a
bureaucratic stroke of the pen,' he said.
He added that it would lead to a significant cut in payments coming in, and
would become a 'charter for fraudsters'.
Mr Herbert said the company would be faced with no choice but to end its
European business altogether because of the legal complexities of chasing
non-payment across borders.
