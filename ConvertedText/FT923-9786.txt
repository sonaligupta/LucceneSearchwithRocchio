FT  03 AUG 92 / Opposition threat to PRI


   By AP


   DURANGO


Mexico yesterday put its democratic reforms to the test in elections in six
states, AP reports from Durango. As the polls opened in the morning the
conservative opposition National Action party (PAN), fresh from victory last
month in the border state of Chihuahua, held high hopes of adding another
governorship in Durango, just to the south.
Elections for governor were also being held in four other states, while Baja
California voters were choosing mayors and state legislators.
A series of opposition victories could cause tension within the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI). The Chihuahua victory was only the
second gubernatorial victory by an opposition party in any of Mexico's 31
states since the PRI was formed in 1929. Some polls showed the two parties
neck and neck in Durango.
