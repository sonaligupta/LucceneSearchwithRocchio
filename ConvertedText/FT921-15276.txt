FT  11 JAN 92 / Labour tax plan for Scotland


   By IVOR OWEN


A SCOTTISH parliament established by a Labour government would have the
power to require taxpayers in Scotland to pay more than the basic rate of
income tax set by the Commons, Mr John Smith, shadow chancellor, confirmed
yesterday.
He said legislation conferring revenue-raising powers on the new body would
permit it to vary the basic rate up or down 'by a small amount'.
Mr Smith reaffirmed in a speech in Glasgow that the Scottish parliament
would receive all revenue from income tax and value added tax paid in
Scotland.
He said Labour's proposals would create a sensible, stable and flexible
system of public finance for a Scottish parliament while maintaining the
coherence of UK economic policy.
Mr Smith challenged the Conservative party to make clear whether, in the
event of a Scottish parliament being established, it would seek to change
the basis for allocating funds from the exchequer so as to reduce the sums
available to Scotland.
He said: 'As shadow chancellor I want to make it clear that the next Labour
government will continue to pool resources and to distribute public
expenditure according to need.'
