FT  16 JUN 93 / Ministers get line on phone plan


   By ANDREW HILL


   BRUSSELS


EUROPEAN Community ministers today have their first chance for detailed
debate on ambitious plans to open all telephone calls to competition by 1998
 -and possibly their last chance to agree a deal on funding for the
promotion of advanced television services in Europe.
Telecommunications ministers, meeting in Luxembourg, are set to discuss the
European Commission's proposed deadline of January 1, 1998, for full
liberalisation of domestic and international calls.
Commission officials say the plan is supported by an influential quartet of
Britain, Germany, France and the Netherlands, but several smaller member
states may press for a delay.
Meanwhile, advocates of an EC wide-screen and high-definition television
(HDTV) strategy are pinning their hopes for a deal on the replacement of the
hardline Mr Edward Leigh as UK minister responsible for telecoms in last
month's ministerial reshuffle.
To the irritation of the Commission, and of the Dutch and French
governments, British opposition, spearheaded by Mr Leigh, has helped force
changes to the original HDTV strategy. Mr Leigh has been replaced by Mr
Patrick McLoughlin, a former junior employment minister, who will have to
decide whether to accept compromise plans for Ecu228m (Pounds 180m) of EC
funding up to the end of 1996.
British diplomats have played down the change in minister, pointing out that
Mr Leigh himself accepted the substance of the plan at the last ministers'
meeting in May, while insisting that the UK could not sign up to a plan
worth more than Ecu150m.
Officials from Belgium, which will take over the EC presidency in July, have
already indicated that if a deal is not struck today, they see little room
for improving the current compromise to meet British objections.
