FT  15 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Compco at Pounds 366,585


Compco Holdings, the property company, achieved pre-tax profits of Pounds
366,585 in the half year to September 25, compared with losses of Pounds
198,149 last time after an exceptional Pounds 550,003 charge relating to one
of its joint venture properties.
Net rental income was little changed at Pounds 919,714 (Pounds 919,977).
Operating expenses, however, increased to Pounds 314,535 (Pounds 268,967)
mainly because of fees incurred in reorganising group borrowings and joint
ventures, the company said.
In December the property at Millharbour, London Docklands, was sold for
Pounds 1.43m, some Pounds 175,000 less than book value, which would be
reflected in the second half.
Earnings per share came through at 11.32p (9.58p losses).
