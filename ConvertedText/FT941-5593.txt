FT  05 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Waterman Partners nearly doubled


Waterman Partnership Holdings, the consulting engineer, nearly doubled
pre-tax profits from Pounds 56,000 to Pounds 106,000 in the half year to
December 31.
In London the group continued to trade profitably and a number of new
commissions were won. However, the volume of international work decreased
because of recession in western Europe and political instability in Russia.
Turnover rose to Pounds 3.98m (Pounds 3.62m). Earnings per share were static
at 0.2p and an unchanged interim dividend of 0.5p is declared.
