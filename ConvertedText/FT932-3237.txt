FT  15 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Strong Frontera sales behind IBC Vehicles'
return to black


   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent


IBC VEHICLES, the UK-based 60/40 joint venture between General Motors and
Isuzu, staged a strong recovery in 1992 with pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.2m
against losses of Pounds 28m in the previous year.
The company, formed in the late 1980s from the former loss-making Bedford
van operations in Luton, more than tripled turnover to Pounds 426m, compared
with Pounds 133.7m.
Production was more than doubled to 48,452 (20,932) vehicles as a result of
the successful build-up of output of the Opel/Vauxhall Frontera four wheel
drive leisure utility vehicle.
The ranges produced by IBC are based on Japanese technology from Isuzu and
Suzuki. GM holds minority equity stakes in both companies.
GM has, however, decided to halt production of the Suzuki-derived range of
microvans at IBC from the end of June following a collapse in demand.
Production of the small vans has plunged from 21,500 in 1989 to 5,652 last
year, and output has been cut to only 1,790 in the first half of this year.
Vauxhall sales of the Rascal van in the UK dropped last year to only 2,478
from 8,274 in 1990.
The market for Japanese-designed microvans has shrunk dramatically, and GM
is hoping that it can meet residual demand through the forthcoming launch of
its new Corsa high-roof van.
As the Rascal is withdrawn other competition is coming into the market,
however, with the launch by Daihatsu of its Italian-built Hijet microvan,
which is being assembled at a joint venture plant at Pontedera, Tuscany with
Piaggio of Italy.
GM is planning to keep the Midi panel van in production at IBC at least
until 1995-96, but it is in negotiations with other vanmakers in Europe
about collaboration on a new vehicle range to replace the ageing Midi in the
second half of the 1990s.
The future of the IBC operation is now tied closely to the production of
four wheel drive leisure utility vehicles; output of the Frontera is planned
to increase from 31,436 last year to 42-45,000 in 1993.
The company has reached agreement with trade unions for the introduction of
a third shift at the plant, if this can be justified by higher demand for
the four wheel drive vehicles, which have succeeded so far in defying the
steep fall in demand for new cars in western Europe.
