FT  24 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Record result at Spring Ram in 'worst
downturn'


   By PEGGY HOLLINGER


SPRING RAM Corporation, the bathroom and kitchen manufacturer, reported a 25
per cent increase in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 30.1m to Pounds 37.6m, for
the year to January 3.
The result, struck on turnover 34 per cent higher at Pounds 194.2m (Pounds
145.3m), was boosted by Pounds 2.5m in interest gains. The group ended the
year with no debt and cash 45 per cent higher at Pounds 45.3m.
The Fordham group, purchased for Pounds 5.8m last year, contributed Pounds
12m in turnover, but nothing to profits.
Mr Stuart Greenwood, finance director, said the group had performed well
through 'the worst downturn in living history'. Turnover, earnings per share
and profits had all reached record levels. Furthermore, he added, 'we have a
balance sheet like a fortress'. The planned Pounds 102m expansion plan would
be funded out of cash resources and Pounds 8.5m of government grants.
Phase one of the programme had been completed during the year, accounting
for about half of the Pounds 14m (Pounds 2.3m) in capital expenditure.
Capital spending was expected to jump to Pounds 42m in 1992 and Pounds 35m
in 1993.
Phase two, which was aimed at building a plant to accommodate the
recently-purchased Regency Doors group, would be complete in mid-1992. Other
plans included a ceramic tile and sanitaryware factory to be built in
Bradford at a cost of Pounds 35m.
Mr Greenwood said that in spite of the increased capital spending the group
expected to end 1992 with Pounds 25m in cash.
The group's three divisions, kitchens, bathrooms, and special products, all
showed good growth in the 12 months. The company refused to break down the
individual figures, however.
Mr Bill Rooney, chairman, said the new year had started well, with sales
well up in the first 10 weeks.
Earnings per share advanced from 5.4p to 7.1p. A proposed final dividend of
0.202p makes a total of 0.288p (0.24p).
COMMENT
If you really search, it might be possible to find a city analyst with a
criticism of this rapidly-growing company, which claims 16 subsidiaries and
47 directors, (all of whom are male). Attempts include those who wonder
whether the cracks are showing in the happy family structure following the
departure of Mr Francis Galvin, a director, last year, and rumours
surrounding others. Also the group's depreciation charge has been accused of
being 'a bit miserly'. Finally, Spring Ram has seen a hefty jump in its
stock levels, but the company has a ready answer. 'We build for stock,' they
say and cite their reputation for prompt delivery. No gearing means they can
probably afford it. The company looks almost certain to continue building
market share on its successful formula. But the market has already absorbed
this fact. Forecasts of Pounds 45m leave the group on a multiple of about
18. For now, the shares look fully valued.
