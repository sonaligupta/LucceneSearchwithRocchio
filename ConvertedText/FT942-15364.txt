FT  15 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Axa


After yesterday's solid full-year figures, it might seem strange that Axa
has underperformed the French equity market by 20 per cent in the last six
months. The profits recovery at the Equitable of the US is stronger than
expected when Axa bought its 49 per cent stake in 1991. In Europe, the
cyclical upswing in insurance markets is starting to help. Since insurance
premiums are still rising in France, and Axa's London market operation is
only just climbing back into profit, the recovery has some way to run.
Yet by buying into the Equitable, Axa now generates 40 per cent of its
premium income in the US. The impact of rising interest rates on the
Equitable's life insurance business - and Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette, the
investment bank which contributed most of last year's US profits - is a
reason for caution. The optimistic forecasts which pushed Axa's shares ahead
last year have now been scaled back.
Besides, while stock and bond markets are falling, investors are probably
more concerned with asset values than earnings. Last year's bull market in
bonds more than offset a FFr4bn write-down in the value of Axa's property
portfolio. But while the pain in property has now been taken, falling
securities markets are still a threat. Until the shadow of a global bear
market has been lifted, Axa will probably continue to trade at a substantial
discount to net assets.
