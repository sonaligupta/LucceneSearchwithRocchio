FT  22 OCT 94 / Briefcase, Q&A: Where the Revenue is wrong


In 1993/94, I had capital gains of Pounds 6,878 and losses of Pounds 2,208,
all after appropriate indexation. In other words, I was Pounds 1,130 below
my annual CGT allowance of Pounds 5,800. Thus, I reported chargeable gains
of 'Pounds 5,800 or less'. But I am not clear, after reading several tax
handbooks, whether I can carry the Pounds 1,130 forward to future years.
On the basic point, the Revenue maintains steadfastly that the answer is no.
But we (and other experts) believe that the House of Lords will one day
confirm our reading of the law - namely, that the answer is a qualified yes
(depending upon the amounts of the individual allowable losses).
The practical problem is that few taxpayers can afford to fight the Revenue
up to the House of Lords in order to establish what the law really is (as
distinct from what the Revenue says it is).
A subsidiary point arises if any part of your 'losses of Pounds 2,208'
relates to disposals after November 29 1993. If there were any (apart from
disposals which produced a chargeable gain after indexation relief), you
might like to come back to us with the full facts, figures and dates because
the carry-forward rules for indexation losses are different from those for
allowable losses.
So far as we know, the Revenue's views on carrying forward 1993-94
indexation losses to 1994-95 (only) are the same as our own: it is only on
the carrying forward of allowable losses that we differ (and have indeed
differed since 1965).
