FT  06 AUG 93 / VW shares rise sharply in Frankfurt


   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES


Volkswagen shares rose sharply in Frankfurt yesterday on hopes for a
'positive' outcome from tonight's extraordinary meeting of the vehicle
maker's supervisory board, writes Christopher Parkes.
The group's stocks rose DM12.5 to reach DM374 at the official close, but
continued climbing in after-market trading, reaching DM377.20 by late
afternoon.
Dealers said they expected the 20 non-executive directors to re-state their
unconditional support for Mr Ferdinand Piech, group chairman, and Mr Jose
Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, production director.
