FT  06 JUN 92 / EC soyabean proposal


   By NANCY DUNNE


   WASHINGTON


The European Community is proposing to negotiate compensation for the US -
as well as for Argentina and Brazil - for the loss of soyabean sales as a
result of European oilseeds subsidies, the EC Commission in Brussels said
yesterday, writes Nancy Dunne in Washington
Under the rules of the the General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade, the US
must accept compensation. The compensation offer is likely to be in the form
of tariff reductions on EC imports.
President Bush, under attack politically from the right and the left and two
opponents in the general election, needs desperately to hold on to his base
of support in the Midwest farm states.
