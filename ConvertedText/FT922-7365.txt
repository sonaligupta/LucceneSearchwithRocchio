FT  19 MAY 92 / International Company News: Barlow Rand rises to R400m at
half year

BARLOW RAND, South Africa's largest industrial group, overcame tough trading
conditions to record a 15 per cent increase in half-year earnings to R400m
(Dollars 140.8m) and pay a higher dividend.
Turnover rose by 9 per cent to R16.9bn in the six months to end-March 1992,
and operating profit, before interest, was 11 per cent higher at R1.36bn.
Pre-tax profit was 20 per cent up at R1.24bn.
Mr Warren Clewlow, executive chairman, said the group had performed well
while enjoying a 'following wind' from the sale of Middelburg Steel and
Alloys (MS&A) last November for R1.1bn.
Mr Clewlow said the sale of MS&A - a producer of ferrochrome and stainless
steel - had changed the nature of Barlow Rand by removing a cyclical
producer which had been a cause of much uncertainty.
He said it was this change that had been behind the group's decision to lift
its dividend by 6 per cent to 54 cents per share.
The effect of the MS&A disposal is also evident in the strengthened balance
sheet where deposits and cash have risen to R1.4bn, from R849m a year ago,
while amounts due to bankers and short-term loans have dropped to R1.2bn
from R2.3bn.
Mr Clewlow was cautious about prospects. He said trading conditions were bad
and he would be happy if they were able to maintain their percentage growth
for the year as a whole. The group is continuing with a substantial capital
expenditure programme, with R680m spent during the reporting period and a
further R1.3bn of capital commitments.
Managing director Mr Derek Cooper told a news conference there was little
likelihood of a short-term recovery in the domestic economy, and the full
impact of the current drought in Africa would be felt in the current six
months of this year.
