FT  04 MAR 94 / International Company News: BBL shrugs off past with 130%
profit increase

Banque Bruxelles Lambert (BBL), one of Belgium's three largest banks,
yesterday announced a 130 per cent rise in net profits over the last year to
BFr6.7bn (Dollars 190m).
Mr Daniel Cardon de Lichtbuer, BBL's chief executive, said the profits
growth showed that the bank was shrugging off the poor performance of the
previous two years.
'The bank has retrieved its position of strength . . . we are back on the
attack,' said Mr Cardon de Lichtbuer, who was appointed to his position at
the end of 1992, after a year in which the bank had been badly hit by
provisions against bad loans and the breakdown of merger talks with the
Dutch group ING.
In spite of previous setbacks, Mr Cardon de Lichtbuer said customer
confidence in the bank remained high, with 12.6 per cent growth in customer
deposits during 1993.
Although this growth had been partly offset by a 7 per cent drop in private
sector loans, the total assets of the bank had risen by 4.8 per cent to
BFr2,290bn.
At the same time, the bank's consolidated cash flow had risen by 28 per cent
to some BFr29.9bn.
Mr Cardon de Lichtbuer said that this, coupled with a significant
improvement in the bank's foreign units, had been the main reason for the
rising profits.
The board is to recommend a dividend of BFr145 per share, compared with
BFr98.8 the previous year.
Gevaert, the Antwerp-based investment group, yesterday announced a 46.8 per
cent growth in profit during 1993. Total consolidated profit was BFr2.9bn,
up from BFr1.9bn the previous year.
