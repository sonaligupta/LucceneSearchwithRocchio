FT  23 OCT 92 / International Company News: Currency movements boost sales
at Sandoz


   By PAUL ABRAHAMS


SANDOZ, the Swiss chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, reported a 9 per cent
increase in sales to SFr11bn (Dollars 8bn) for the first nine months to
September 30. The result benefitted from favourable currency movements.
The sales increase was satisfactory given the recessionary pressures, the
turbulence of the European monetary system and the dollar's weakness, the
company said.
The group expects an increase in profits for the first nine months because
of innovative products and strict cost management.
Mr Raymond Breu, group treasurer, said staff levels would continue to fall
at the Basel headquarters. Hundreds of jobs have already been cut in the
chemicals division.
The pharmaceuticals and nutrition divisions' manufacturing operations in
Europe were being rationalised, said Mr Breu. A plant was being built in
Ireland which has a favourable tax regime. Some European nutrition plants
could also be shut, he added.
All divisions improved their revenues. The largest, pharmaceuticals,
increased sales 10 per cent from SFr4.69bn to SFr5.17bn. The group said the
growth of its new drugs Lamisil, an anti-fungal, Sandostatin, a cancer
treatment, and Lomir, a blood pressure medicine, had been particularly
gratifying.
The nutrition business, which includes Ovaltine and Wasa crispbread,
increased sales by 20 per cent from SFr1.12bn to SFr1.35bn.
The chemicals division increased sales 5 per cent from SFr1.78bn to
SFr1.87bn in spite of difficult market conditions, said the company.
Agrochemicals increased sales 2 per cent from SFr949m to SFr970m, although
in local currencies there was a 1 per cent decline. Seeds increased 9 per
cent from SFr801m to SFr876m.
