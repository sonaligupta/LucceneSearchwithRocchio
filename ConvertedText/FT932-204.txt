FT  30 JUN 93 / Capital Radio agrees to restrict advert discounts


   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent


CAPITAL RADIO has agreed with the Office of Fair Trading to restrict giving
extra discounts to advertisers who promise exclusively to use either of its
two stations, Capital Gold, on the AM wavelength, or Capital FM.
The office informally began looking into Capital's advertising discounting
just over a year ago. Capital had been extending discounts of between 5 per
cent and 10 per cent to advertisers willing to enter an exclusive
arrangement, on top of the normal discounts - up to 20 per cent in Capital's
case - available for volume advertising.
In some campaigns marketing a new product, Capital's additional discounts
were as high as 50 per cent for an exclusive deal, and 25 per cent for a
deal which included just one other station besides Capital Radio.
Capital has now given assurances that such additional discounting will in
future be restricted to 'test campaigns' in which the advertisements are not
transmitted for more than two months out of a six-month 'campaign period'.
A minute of radio advertising time might cost as much as Pounds 7,000 on
London's commercial radio stations.
Mr Richard Eyre, managing director of Capital Radio, said the practice of
discounting for volume sales - common across all media forms - is unaffected
by Capital's agreement. He added: 'But the OFT has thought that we are too
big a presence in the London radio market to be allowed to offer these extra
discounts.'
