FT  19 APR 94 / International Company News: Budgens plan above costings


   By ANDREW BOLGER


   LONDON


A plan backed by Rewe, one of Germany's largest food retailers, to open
discount stores in the south-east of England has proved more expensive than
anticipated.
Rewe has a 29 per cent stake in Budgens, the small UK retailing chain which
yesterday said the conversion of nine of its stores to Rewe's Penny Market
format had exceeded costings.
Shares in the UK group fell by 5p to 29p after it warned trading profits
from the 89 stores operating the traditional format were likely to be 15 per
cent lower than the previous year.
However, Mr Christian Williams, executive director of Budgens, said the
group was sticking by its plans to open 40 discount food stores in the
south-east over two years.
Budgens said it had originally estimated the nine stores could be converted
for about Pounds 600,000 (Dollars 876,000.)
