FT  13 NOV 92 / Observer: Mountain time


The final hours of poor old Dan-Air were not as trouble free as first
thought. Observer hears that it was touch and go right up to the end whether
Dan Dare, as it was affectionately known, would arrive safely inside the
British Airways corporate hangar.
Admittedly, it would have been out of character if there had not been some
last-minute delays. The deal was supposed to have been signed off on Friday
November 6. By 3.30 the next morning, the signs on the Gatwick check-in
desks were being changed from Dan-Air to British Airways. However, the deal
had still not been signed and the nervous lawyers ordered the Dan-Air staff
to put back their signs and return to work.
It turned out that the last piece in the deal's jigsaw lay in the hands of a
Californian bank, which had to agree to the transfer of an aircraft lease.
Trouble was, the bank's executives were communing with nature and each
other, but not the outside world, in tents in the Sierra Nevada mountains. A
fax machine was back-packed into the wilderness and the deal was concluded
at 12.21 pm on Sunday.
