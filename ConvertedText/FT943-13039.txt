FT  21 JUL 94 / Brewers accused of 'bully tactics'


Many tenants of tied public houses were being subjected to 'heavy-handed
bully-boy tactics' by some of the big brewing companies, Ms Kate Hoey,
Labour MP for Vauxhall, told the Commons yesterday.
She claimed that the legal requirement limiting to 2,000 the number of tied
properties linked to each brewery was being ignored, and that tenants were
being forced to pay rent increases of between 100 and 150 per cent in some
cases.
