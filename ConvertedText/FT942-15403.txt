FT  15 APR 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Getting a peep at rare books


   By DELLA BRADSHAW


Some of the world's rarest books and documents are stored in the Vatican
Library. But every year only about 2,000 scholars are allowed access to the
150,000 manuscripts and 2m books.
To bring the works of art to the attention of a wider audience, the Vatican
Library has teamed up with the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de
Janeiro and computer maker IBM to examine the creation of a database so that
images of the manuscripts can be displayed on PC screens internationally.
The images could be stored on CD-Rom or distributed across networks.
The pilot project will examine the feasibility of creating a high-resolution
database from such fragile volumes.
Vatican: Italy, 66982.
