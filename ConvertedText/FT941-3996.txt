FT  14 MAR 94 / Mexican political threat


   By DAMIAN FRASER


   MEXICO CITY


Mr Manuel Camacho Sols, the Mexican government's peace envoy in the southern
state of Chiapas, has indicated he might run for national office if the
government did not approve democratic reforms under discussion for the
country and failed to comply with the recent peace accord for the rebels in
Chiapas.
He thereby resisted rising pressure from his colleagues in the governing
party to rule himself out of the presidential race.
The party's 65-year hold on power could be jeopardised if Mr Camacho, a
former mayor of Mexico City and an ex-foreign minister, were to realise his
veiled threat to run as an opposition candidate in the presidential election
in August.
'If there are no advances in democracy and if, instead of accord, there is
polarisation and if anyone wants to trample on my political rights as a
citizen, then after I have fulfilled my mission in Chiapas, I will take the
necessary political decision to bring democracy and unity to Mexico,' Mr
Camacho told reporters.
