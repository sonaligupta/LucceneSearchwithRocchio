FT  06 AUG 93 / Shipbuyers win extra credit aid


   By DANIEL GREEN


CUSTOMERS OF shipyards are to get extra financial support under rule changes
announced yesterday by the Department of Trade and Industry.
Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, announced a cut in the level of
security needed to qualify for the home shipbuilding credit guarantee scheme
(HCS). 'New applicants for HCS will now be able to use their new vessels as
security for up to 60 per cent of the loan - rather than the 40 or 50 per
cent that has been the practice in the past,' he said.
'This will produce a more level playing field for UK shipbuilders, helping
them to compete with shipbuilders from around the world.
'We are also committed to speeding up processing of the loans, reducing the
red tape and cost of applications.'
Mr Geoff Dean, technical director of A&P Appledore Shipbuilders in north
Devon, said that the change 'will obviously be of help, especially to
smaller shipowners which sometimes have trouble raising the loans they
need'.
The credit guarantee scheme has two main functions: it guarantees loans
provided to shipowners by commercial banks and pays any difference in
interest if the rate is above 7.5 per cent.
Only merchant ships being built or altered at UK shipyards qualify for
assistance.
The scheme is restricted to individuals or companies in the UK, Isle of Man
or the Channel Islands. A foreign company must register as a UK company to
use the scheme.
At March 31 1992, the total amount guaranteed was Pounds 898m, and interest
subsidy paid in 1992-93 was Pounds 20.9m.
The government said that about 20 yards are in a position to benefit from
the changes. Last year they employed 5,750 people and built 28 vessels worth
Pounds 220m.
The change may help slow the fall in capacity and production seen in recent
years. In 1990, 23 yards employed 8,160 people to make 33 ships that were
worth Pounds 238m. A year later, one yard had closed and production fell to
31 ships worth Pounds 209m.
Some of these ships went to foreign buyers who would not have qualified for
help.
