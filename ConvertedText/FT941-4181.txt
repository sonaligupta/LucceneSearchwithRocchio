FT  12 MAR 94 / Labour attacks watchdog changes


Mr Alistair Darling, Labour's City spokesman, has seized on the views of
some Tory backbenchers to intensify pressure on the government over
regulation in the financial services sector. A Commons committee is already
examining the issue.
Seven Conservative MPs have tabled a Commons motion which suggests that the
Personal Investment Authority, the new watchdog for retail financial
services, will lower regulatory standards.
In a letter to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, Mr Darling says the
government cannot 'continue to ignore the mounting concern and scepticism
that surrounds the present system of regulation'.
