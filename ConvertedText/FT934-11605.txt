FT  30 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Tiphook to pay interest on Dollars
350m-worth of loan notes


   By RICHARD GOURLAY


TIPHOOK, the UK container leasing and transport rental group, said yesterday
that it would be paying US bondholders the interest on two unsecured loan
notes worth Dollars 350m (Pounds 232m) which falls due on Monday.
The decision to make the payments will relieve some of the pressure from
bondholders in the US while the group works out a refinancing arrangement
with its bankers.
Had the group decided not to pay the interest immediately, it could have
taken advantage of a 30 day grace period before it would have been in breach
of the terms of the notes.
