JAPAN'S TRADE surplus for April rose 13.4 per cent compared with the same
month last year to Dollars 7.16bn (Pounds 4.04bn), reflecting the strong
increase in exports that has accompanied the slowing of the domestic
economy.
Meanwhile, corporate bankruptcies rose 14 per cent from March, Tokyo
department store sales were 5 per cent lower than in April last year, and
wholesale prices were down 0.1 per cent from March.
In spite of the signs of economic slowing, the Ministry of International
Trade and Industry (Miti) said the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development (OECD) was too conservative in its estimate of 1.8 per cent
Japanese growth for 1992, and that the figure would be closer to the
government estimate of 3.5 per cent.
The Ministry of Finance said customs-cleared exports rose 13 per cent from a
year earlier to Dollars 27.23bn and imports were 12.8 per cent higher at
Dollars 20.07bn, though the figure was distorted by a taxation change that
led to a once-only 58 per cent increase in fuel imports to Dollars 4.55bn.
Seasonally adjusted, the surplus fell from Dollars 9.14bn in March to
Dollars 6.86bn, with a 4.3 per cent fall in exports and a 5.8 per cent
increase in exports.
But year-on-year export growth was strong for most leading items and
markets. Exports to the US rose 15.8 per cent to Dollars 7.52bn and imports
were unchanged at Dollars 4.23bn, while exports to the European Community
were 11.1 per cent higher at Dollars 5.41bn and imports rose 11.9 per cent
to Dollars 2.66bn, highlighted by the first increase in artwork imports in a
year and a half.
The express rate of growth in trade with China continued, with Japan's
exports to that country rising by 37.2 per cent and imports up by 39.4 per
cent. Present trends suggest that China will leapfrog Taiwan, South Korea
and Germany in the next year to become Japan's second largest trading
partner.
Exports of transport machinery, by value, rose 19.7 per cent on a year
earlier, of chemicals by 19.4 per cent, of precision instruments by 15.8 per
cent and of ordinary machinery by 13.1 per cent.
As for bankruptcies, Teikoku Data Bank, the credit research agency, said
46.8 per cent of the total were linked to the collapse of Japan's economic
bubble or the slowing of the economy. The number of cases in April rose 33
per cent from the same month last year.
The Japan Department Stores' Association said the 5 per cent fall in Tokyo
sales during April was partly caused by unfavourable weather, which led to a
4 per cent fall in clothing revenue. Household goods sales were down 11.1
per cent, while sales of food items rose 4.8 per cent.
Bank of Japan officials, who are concerned that inflation could be
stimulated by increased economic activity, said the composite wholesale
price index fell 0.1 per cent from March, and was down 1.2 per cent from
April last year. However, the bank remains concerned about price rises in
the service sector.
