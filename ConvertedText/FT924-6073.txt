FT  24 NOV 92 / International Company News: PepsiCo in Dollars 320m Spanish
purchases

   NEW YORK


PEPSICO, the large US soft drinks, snacks and restaurants group, yesterday
stepped up its assault on the Spanish market by acquiring Kas, a beverage
brand owner, and Knoor Elorza SA (KESA), a production operation which
manufactures, bottles and distributes for both Kas and Pepsi.
The Dollars 320m deal virtually doubles Pepsi's share of the Spanish
carbonated soft drinks market - traditionally dominated by Coca-Cola, its
big domestic rival - by adding Kas's 6 per cent market share to Pepsi's 7
per cent. A year ago, Pepsi earmarked Spain as a major area for
international expansion, saying it would invest at least Dollars 1bn there
over the next five years in local beverage and food operations.
The Kas and KESA businesses are both majority-owned by Banco Bilbao Vizcaya,
the Spanish bank. Pepsi already holds a 30 per cent stake in KESA, which was
formed in 1989 as a joint venture between the US company and the Knoor
family, which founded Kas.
The aim of KESA was to create a single, country-wide bottling syspten which
could produce and sell Pepsi's soft drinks brands, plus all of Kas's
fruit-flavoured drinks and mixers. Pepsi's bottling had previously been
split between half a dozen franchise operations, and in Cataluna the
business is still franchised to Cadbury-Schweppes. KESA's facilities take in
a 'southern hub' in Seville and a northern centre in Echevarri, Vitoria.
Net annual sales for the combined beverage operations are estimated to be
around Dollars 470m in 1992, and Pepsi yesterday predicted that this figure
could rise to over Dollars 1bn within five years. Most of the products sell
under the Kas name.
In addition to commanding 6 per cent of the carbonated soft drinks market,
Kas also holds around 8 per cent of the juice nectar sector.
