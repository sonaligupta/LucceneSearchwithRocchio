FT  06 JUN 92 / Foreigners raise direct investment


   By STEFAN WAGSTYL

FOREIGN direct investment in Japan soared 56 per cent to Dollars 4.3bn
(Pounds 2.36bn) in the year to the end of March as foreign companies took
advantage of the fall in Japanese land prices to expand sales outlets,
writes Stefan Wagstyl in Tokyo.
Figures published yesterday by the finance ministry showed foreign companies
increased investments in Japan to a record level. They were particularly
active in buying distribution companies, warehouses, and wholesale and
retail outlets.
Bankers specialising in inward investment said foreign direct investment in
1992-93 could rise further as US and European companies saw the drop in
Japanese asset prices and the slow-down in the Japanese economy as a rare
opportunity to invest.
Meanwhile the ministry's report also showed Japanese direct investment
overseas fell sharply for the second year in succession - by 26.9 per cent
to Dollars 41.6bn. Japanese companies' appetite for foreign investment was
curbed by constraints on fund-raising caused by the fall in the Tokyo stock
market, the recession in world property markets and the global economic
slow-down.
