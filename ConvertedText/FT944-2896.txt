FT  15 DEC 94 / International Company News: Sprint links with Telmex and
cancels Iusacell deal

City Sprint, the US telecommunications group, is to form an alliance with
Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex), the country's telephone monopoly, to provide
services throughout North America.
The deal cancels the previous accord between Sprint and Grupo Iusacell, a
leading Mexican cellular telecoms company, to provide long-distance
telephone services when Mexico's market is opened up to competition from
January 1997.
Sprint and Telmex did not release financial details of their deal, saying
the accord would not create a new entity. Instead, the two companies have
promised to exchange products and services, including software platforms and
other intellectual property.
Sprint said its alliance with Telmex would help it create a seamless North
American telecoms network. Sprint is already aligned with Call-Net, a
Canadian long-distance carrier, and operates four cross-border fibre optic
connections with Telmex between the US and Mexico.
Additionally, it is part-owned by France Telecom, which owns a 10 per cent
stake in Telmex.
Telmex said the alliance was an important step as it prepares to lose its
monopoly in the Mexican market, which is valued at about Dollars 7bn a year,
and which Sprint estimates could be worth Dollars 20bn annually by the turn
of the century.
Last month, when US telecoms group AT&T struck a deal with Mexican
industrial conglomerate Grupo Alfa, Telmex was criticised for failing to
sign up with an important international long-distance carrier.
Iusacell, 42 per cent of which is owned by Bell Atlantic, blamed delays by
the Mexican government in publishing market regulations for the failure of
its own accord with Sprint.
It said it would continue with plans to enter the Mexican long-distance
market and to provide local services.
