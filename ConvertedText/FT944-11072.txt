FT  08 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Less than ecstatic


   From Mrs BARBARA COULTAS


Sir, Your travel writer, Kate Bevan, tells us in her article 'A sharp eye on
the clouds' (November 5/6) that Santa Barbara is 'blessed with a wonderful
beach'.
Our experience in July 1992 left my family rather less ecstatic. The beach
was dirty, the sea smelt of ammonia (perhaps as a result of the oil derricks
dotted across the horizon) and the only other sun-worshippers were a handful
of winos slumped under the trees. While my husband and son braved the
hazards for a short dip, my daughter and I were not prepared to take the
risk.
I can only presume that the town's cleansing department has performed a
miracle in the last two years. Barbara Coultas,
