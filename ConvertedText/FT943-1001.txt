FT  27 SEP 94 / Sri Lanka moves on Airbus probe

The Sri Lankan government has appointed a former Supreme Court judge to
investigate the purchase of five aircraft worth Dollars 643m (Pounds 407m)
by Air Lanka, from Airbus Industrie, the European aircraft maker, writes
Mervyn de Silva in Colombo.
Mrs Chandrika Kumaratunge, the prime minister who took office a month ago,
has asked Mr O M Seneviratne to head a commission of inquiry into the
contract, which was signed in August 1991, under the rule of the previous
United National Party government.
The purchase has been criticised for being secretive and too costly.
The contract is the largest of several transactions involving foreign
companies which are being investigated after widespread allegations of
financial irregularities.
Allegations of irregularities by members of the UNP government, which held
power for 17 years until its general election defeat last month, played a
big role in the election.
Mrs Kumaratunge's victory was due partly to her promises to root out
corruption.
Air Lanka originally contracted to buy five Airbus A340-300 jets - three to
be delivered in 1994 and 1995, and two for delivery in 1998 and 1999. The
orders were placed amid controversy in Sri Lanka about whether scarce
foreign exchange should be spent on the aircraft.
Whatever the inquiry finds, the newly elected government would find it
costly to scrap the contracts because Air Lanka has paid a pre-delivery
deposit of Dollars 74m.
