FT  28 JAN 94 / Labour calls for probe into Astra


Labour yesterday called for a public inquiry into the collapse of Astra
Training, accusing the government of squandering a precious national asset.
Mr Tony Lloyd, shadow employment minister, said the training provider, set
up when the government privatised the Skills Training Agency, had
'systematically milked' the training funding system.
The Department of Employment said there was no need for an inquiry.
Setting out his concerns in a letter to Mr David Hunt, the employment
secretary, Mr Lloyd said the government could not dismiss its
responsibilities by claiming that Astra was a private company.
