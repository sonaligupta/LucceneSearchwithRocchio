FT  01 JUL 92 / China auctions company

   BEIJING


A bankrupt state company is to be auctioned for the first time in China,
writes Yvonne Preston in Beijing.
According to the official China Daily, foreign buyers are welcome to bid for
Guangchang Color Printing Equipment company, based in Shenzhen, the special
economic zone bordering Hong Kong. Bad management and low profits put the
company heavily in debt, the newspaper added, and made it the first
bankruptcy to occur in Shenzhen, with debts amounting to 2m yuan (Pounds
197,000). Auctioning off the company's property would protect the interests
of creditors, the paper said. Past practice has been to hand bankrupt
enterprises to government departments.
