FT  16 DEC 94 / Tunnel shuttle service to start


Passenger shuttle services through the Channel tunnel will start next
Thursday after the award yesterday of a safety certificate to Eurotunnel,
the tunnel operator.
The level of fares to be charged will be announced today. They are expected
to be roughly comparable with those charged by the ferries, with which the
shuttles will compete.
The start-up of passenger shuttles is 18 months later than originally
planned. It will complete the range of services offered by the tunnel after
earlier launches of freight shuttles, through freight trains and Eurostar
through services between London, Paris and Brussels.
