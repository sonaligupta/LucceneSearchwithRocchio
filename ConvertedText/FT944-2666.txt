FT  16 DEC 94 / Customers unaware of new gas measures


Down at the Peckham gas showroom in south London yesterday customers were
unaware of the impending changes. Detailed leaflets explaining what will
happen were piled on the bill payment counter and there were posters around
the walls to do the same.
But the customers were already finding it hard to cope. Two telephone lines
to connect them with the accounts office to discuss problems over bills
seemed permanently engaged. 'We are using contract staff - and not many of
them. Such a large number in accounts have already taken voluntary
redundancy,' explained one showroom assistant.
British Gas argues customers will be able to pay their bills through any
post office and will be encouraged to arrange payment through banks. In
future, customers will have to ring different phone numbers from outside the
showrooms to deal with gas bill and service inquiries, the reporting of gas
leaks and to receive free advice on saving energy.
The leaflet at Peckham, which is standard through all showrooms, says: 'At
British Gas we're always keen to improve our service. So to give you more
choice and more specialised attention we're making important changes to all
our gas shops.' As it explains, the aim is to 'make sure more staff are free
to help you choose the appliance that's right for you'.
