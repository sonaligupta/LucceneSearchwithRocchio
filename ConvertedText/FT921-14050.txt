FT  17 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Home Office considers poll tax case


THE Home Office was yesterday considering issues raised by the adjournment
of nearly 2,500 cases of alleged poll tax default at Camberwell Magistrates'
Court in London after a magistrate ruled it would 'not be appropriate' to
hear them until the issue of the acceptability of computer-based payment
records had been resolved.
The new cases, coming a day after magistrates in Liverpool postponed for two
weeks more than 200 cases of alleged non-payment of the community charge,
have raised speculation that doubt over computer-based evidence may render
past prosecutions invalid.
But the Home Office said there was no reason for local councils to stop
taking community charge cases to court if the local authorities were able to
prove the debt had not been paid.
'Although it is not for the Home Office to interpret the law,' the
department said in a statement last night, 'we have no reason to suppose
that computer-generated records are not admissible in civil proceedings, in
accordance with the provisions of the Evidence Act 1938.
'The Home Office is urgently looking into the issues raised in a recent case
to consider whether any action is required.'
