FT  12 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Enterprise Oil falls 21% but raises
dividend


   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES


ENTERPRISE OIL, one of the UK's leading oil exploration and production
companies, raised its dividend slightly yesterday in spite of a 21 per cent
fall in 1992 after-tax profits from Pounds 110.5m to Pounds 87m.
The company increased its dividend - for the sixth consecutive year - by 1.6
per cent to 16p (15.75p).
Profits came out at the high end of analysts' expectations, but were buoyed
by some Pounds 30m of after-tax gains from asset disposals.
Mr John Walmesley, finance director, said the company had put a focus on its
financial performance last year and, as a result, halved its exploration
spending, sold some assets and cut its headquarters staff by about 30.
The curtailment of the exploration programme was reflected in the drop in
the company's oil and gas reserves from 948.3m barrels to 907.4m barrels,
which disappointed some analysts.
'We now have an attractive mix between the financial and the physical side
of the company,' said Mr Walmesley. 'Those exploration prospects haven't
gone away.' Oil production rose to an average of 145,813 barrels a day last
year.
Exploration spending will increase this year to Pounds 80m, against Pounds
74m, which had dropped from Pounds 116m in 1991. Altogether Enterprise's
capital expenditure budget for last year was lower at Pounds 450m (Pounds
470m).
The company's Scott and Nelson fields in the North Sea are due to come on
stream this year and next, which will boost production to 250,000 b/d by
1994.
Enterprise holds a 10 per cent stake in the discovery announced this week of
440m barrels of oil in the Norwegian Sea - Norway's biggest oil find for
eight years. About 26m barrels of oil from the find are likely to accrue to
Enterprise after clawbacks.
Profits before tax in 1992 were Pounds 144.9m (Pounds 114.4m) and earnings
per share came to 18.5p (24.5p). Turnover reached Pounds 538m (Pounds 488m).
Gearing was approximately 45 per cent.
COMMENT
Enterprise's oil output is set to peak in 1995 once its two most recent
North Sea fields enter production, and after that it will tail off. The key
issue for the City right now is the management's ability to grow the company
beyond that point. Enterprise insists it has the financial firepower to buy
production assets that will offer good growth towards the end of the decade
 -but the City is looking for news of an acquisition in the next 18 months.
Enterprise's management has done very well at finding oil in the past, but a
note of caution was sounded with yesterday's results, when the company
failed to replace its reserves for the first time in several years. City
expectations are already built into the share price which is trading at an
11 per cent premium to net asset value and any increase in price does not
look justified at present. The shares are now resting on the City's faith in
Enterprise's management.
