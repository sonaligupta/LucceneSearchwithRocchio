FT  11 MAR 94 / International Company News: Raytheon to take Dollars 162m
charge, shed 4,400 jobs

Raytheon, the Massachusetts-based defence group, is to cut up to 4,400 jobs,
or 7 per cent of its workforce, over the next two years and will take a
Dollars 162m after-tax charge in the first quarter to cover the
restructuring.
The move is the latest in the consolidation of the US defence industry,
which has been struggling with sharply lower Pentagon spending since the
collapse of the Soviet empire.
Raytheon said 65 per cent of the charges related to its defence business and
the rest to its commercial operations, which include the manufacture of
aircraft and appliances, as well as engineering and construction work.
Raytheon, best known for manufacturing the Patriot missile, said that
despite the charge, which works through at Dollars 1.20 a share, it will
still be profitable in the first quarter. It had net income of Dollars
157.5m, or Dollars 1.16 a share, in the same period of 1993.
The company is one of the largest employers in New England and the
centrepiece of its restructuring plan is the consolidation of its missile
manufacturing operations in the region into its Andover, Massachusetts,
plant.
This will result in the closure of facilities in Lowell, Northboro and
Norwood, Massachusetts.
