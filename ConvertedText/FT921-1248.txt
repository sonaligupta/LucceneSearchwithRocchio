FT  25 MAR 92 / International Company News: Monopolies watchdog to pay BIL
costs


   By TERRY HALL


   WELLINGTON


THE New Zealand Commerce Commission, the monopolies watchdog, has been
ordered to pay Brierley Investments (BIL), the New Zealand investment and
trading group, NZDollars 20,000 (USDollars 11,000) in costs by the country's
High Court after it dropped an action over the control of shareholdings in
Air New Zealand.
This was the final round in a protracted 'war' which began early last year
when Mr Bill Dix, Qantas chairman, said arrangements with other Air New
Zealand shareholders including Brierley Investments, American Airlines and
Japan Airlines, gave Qantas control of 50 per cent of voting rights on the
Air New Zealand board. BIL consistently denied the accusations, and
criticised the Commerce Commission for continuing with its inquiry.
Qantas owns 19.9 per cent of Air New Zealand and BIL 42.5 per cent.
In deciding to drop the action, Dr Susan Lojkine, the Commerce Commission
chairman, said the commission had effectively blocked Qantas from buying
more shares without its approval.
Mr Paul Collins, BIL chief executive, yesterday attacked the way the
commission conducted its inquiry 'by press release', and said the withdrawal
of court proceedings was a vindication of BIL's position. Statements made by
the commission had been damaging when they had been found to be untrue. He
accused the commission of being anti-business.
Last month. the commission reopened the matter by demanding firm assurances
from BIL that it was not involved in any secret arrangement to give Qantas
greater control of Air New Zealand.
