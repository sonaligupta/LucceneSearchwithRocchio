FT  05 JUN 92 / Maastricht in the Balance: Neighbours feel the chill winds -
Uncertainty is sweeping the Nordic region


   By ROBERT TAYLOR


HOSTILITY to European Community membership is sweeping the Nordic region
following Denmark's narrow rejection of the Maastricht treaty.
A few weeks ago the timetable for much of the region to enter the EC by 1995
looked secure. Now there is considerable uncertainty, with Sweden, Finland
and Norway needing majority approval in binding referendums before they can
join the Community. '
As many as 45 per cent of Swedes are opposed to their country's application
for EC membership, with only 28 per cent in favour, according to a poll
published yesterday. This suggests a rapid swing against the EC; in July
1991, when the then Social Democratic Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson handed
in Sweden's EC membership application, about 60 per cent of Swedes supported
the move. Only 14 per cent said they were against EC entry.
Attitudes in Norway towards the EC have been evenly divided for some time
but they appear to be hardening against membership. An opinion poll
published yesterday in Aftonposten, the country's leading newspaper, showed
53 per cent of Norwegians now opposed EC membership, with 33 per cent in
favour.
In Finland public opinion remains more favourable, with the latest poll
finding 56 per cent of Finns in support of the membership application made
in March, with 31 per cent opposing it.
Sweden has seen the most dramatic shift in public opinion, largely predating
Tuesday's referendum in Denmark. Women have grown increasingly hostile to
the EC, with 40 per cent opposing their country's entry and 32 per cent in
favour. Many of them believe Sweden's welfare state would be endangered by
membership.
The most significant shift has been among Social Democratic supporters, 47
per cent of whom are against EC entry and only 24 per cent in favour even
though the party leadership under Mr Carlsson supports the cause. Mr
Carlsson blames Mr Carl Bildt, Sweden's right-wing prime minister, for the
growth of anti-EC sentiment.
There is little doubt Mr Bildt believes his radical economic programme to
make Sweden more competitive and market oriented is vital if the country is
to join the EC, in spite of being politically unpopular in the short-term
for increasing unemployment and squeezing living standards.
Mr Bildt had hoped Sweden's membership negotiations would be finalised by
the end of next year, with a referendum in time for the next general
election in September 1994. However, the Social Democrats have recovered the
backing they lost in September's election, with the latest opinion survey
giving them 43 per cent support.
Before he became prime minister Mr Bildt feared that the Social Democrats in
opposition would behave like the British Labour party after it lost office
in June 1970 and drop its pro-EC position in favour of a No campaign.
This still looks a unlikely, but the strains inside the Swedish labour
movement over the issue are likely to grow.
The same is true in Norway, where memories of a No vote in the 1972 EC
referendum still trouble politicians, particularly in the powerful Labour
Movement. The Labour party's conference in November is expected to endorse a
membership application, but the minority government's experiences over the
European Economic Area deal suggest that opening talks with Brussels will
detonate a furious national debate.
The Nordic governments will need more time to convince their voters about
the wisdom of joining the EC. Any rush to early membership could end in
disaster at the polls.
