FT  30 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Exceptionals push LIT Pounds 21m into the
red


   By DAVID BLACKWELL


LIT HOLDINGS, the marketing services, investment and fund management group,
plunged deeply into the red in the first half, reporting a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 20.6m.
The deficit follows exceptional items of Pounds 27.5m related to the sale in
July of LIT America, its US futures and options clearing subsidiary, for
Dollars 23.6m (Pounds 15.6m). The sale resulted in a loss of Pounds 7.7m and
a charge, under FRS 3, of Pounds 19.8m for goodwill previously written off
to reserves.
In the first-half of 1992 the group made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 2.25m.
The group is planning to restructure and change its name to Johnson Fry
Holdings. Mr Paul Gildersleeves, company secretary, said yesterday that the
restructuring would mark the end of a troubled period of three or four
years, leaving the company to face the future without debt.
The company is repaying its Pounds 12m of outstanding debt through the
proceeds of the LIT America sale and profits from Johnson Fry, the UK
financial services company, this year.
Johnson Fry boosted operating profits from Pounds 2.4m to Pounds 7.73m.
Turnover rose from Pounds 12m to Pounds 24.7m - higher than for full year
1992, when turnover was Pounds 22.5m.
Mr Gildersleeves said that Johnson Fry's performance had been boosted by its
success with business expansion scheme issues. The company raised Pounds
281.5m of BES funds in the half compared with Pounds 98.2m in first-half
1992 and Pounds 159.2m for the whole of last year.
Business expansion schemes, which end this year, accounted for 62 per cent
of the turnover. Mr Gildersleeves said it was inevitable revenues would dip
next year.
The company would concentrate on investment management and residential
property management.
Losses loss per share were 42.9p (earnings 1.8p). Without the LIT America
charge, earnings would have been 5p.
