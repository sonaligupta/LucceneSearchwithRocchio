FT  27 SEP 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Latest news when an ill
wind blows - In A Nutshell


It is said that every cloud has a silver lining. What is insolvency for one
company can be an opportunity for another to pick up cheap assets and stock
or to expand its customer base.
Smoothing the way in this corporate jungle is a new publication that claims
to be the first service to provide daily information about corporate
insolvency by fax. London-based IT Systems Publishing compiles information
from the official publication, the London Gazette, and the High Court and
faxes subscribers overnight.
Subscribers may request a tailored service that will give them information
about insolvencies only in manufacturing or the computer industry, for
example. The service gives the names and contact number of liquidators.
Publisher Simon Thompson says subscribers also use the service, which lists
petitions for winding-up orders, to give them an early warning that
customers are in trouble.
