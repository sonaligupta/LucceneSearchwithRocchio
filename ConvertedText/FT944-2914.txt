FT  15 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Improved markets for ECC


   By GEOFF DYER


Shares in English China Clays, the minerals and chemicals group, rose 17p to
340p yesterday after it announced a modestly improved performance in the
third quarter in its main markets, especially the paper sector.
The Calgon offshoot in the US increased dollar sales revenue by 5 per cent
against the previous year, with the strongest growth in paper chemicals.
Sales of ECC's European sourced minerals rose 3 per cent, a lower rate of
increase than in the first half, and ECC's sales in the Americas and Pacific
region were flat.
An exceptional charge estimated at Pounds 5m will be made against 1994
operating profit for further rationalisation at Calgon. This also includes
the cost of integrating EZE Products, the US supplier of speciality
chemicals to the paper and surface-treatment industries, which it acquired
for Dollars 45.4m (Pounds 27.6m) in October.
