FT  11 JAN 92 / Philippines close to IMF agreement


   By VICTOR MALLET

THE Philippines has provisionally agreed with the International Monetary
Fund the main points of its 1992 economic programme, except for additional
state spending following the eruption of the Mount Pinatubo volcano last
year, Mr Jesus Estanislao, the finance secretary, announced yesterday.
Mr Estanislao said he hoped the IMF would give its approval in February. He
made clear, however, that success depended on the government's ability to
persuade the reluctant Philippines Senate to approve tax reform measures to
increase revenue, permitting the government to meet IMF fiscal targets.
The IMF has suspended payments from a Dollars 900m loan package agreed last
year, and its refusal to endorse the Philippines has delayed other debt
rescheduling agreements.
Mr Estanislao said the approval of at least some tax measures was crucial,
but he suggested that the government would be prepared to cut expenditure in
order to meet IMF budget targets if the Senate refused to back all the
reforms.
He said the IMF had accepted a slight rise in budget expenditure in real
terms for the year, a move which would theoretically leave the overall
public sector deficit at less than 3 per cent of GDP or just under Pesos
39bn (Pounds 800m).
The Philippines has been given a breathing space by a recent improvement in
the economy. Mr Estanislao predicted real growth of 2 to 3 per cent in 1992,
with an acceleration in the rate expected during the second half of the
year. 'Substantial progress has been made in stabilising the economy,' he
said.
