FT  22 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Smiths Industries


Being the star performer in the aerospace sector is a mixed blessing these
days, as yesterday's full-year results from Smiths Industries showed. Smiths
has effective management, a focused strategy, generates cash and has a
strong balance sheet. It also has a market capitalisation twice that of
British Aerospace. Unfortunately, production of the Boeing 737, which
provides Smiths' civil bread and butter, could halve by 1994-95. The
European Fighter Aircraft project is in doubt, and US defence spending will
continue to fall. Smiths' earnings have been virtually flat for five years,
and will remain so for at least another two.
Using its cash pile to expand into medical operations is the company's
chosen way out of the box, but there is a snag. Healthcare companies sell on
fancy earnings multiples. Smiths recently paid 20 times earnings for the
anaesthetics company Infotech. With Smiths rated at only 13 times earnings,
the company will have to work hard to prevent such acquisitions diluting
earnings. Even then, the medical division will only patch up part of the
hole blown in aerospace earnings.
A strategy of funding expansion from internally-generated cash deserves more
support than companies who use paper and acquisition accounting liberally.
But with the market starting to focus on growth, Smiths' management must
wish they did not have to start from here.
