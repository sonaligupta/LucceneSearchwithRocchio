FT  30 JUN 93 / Christie's in plan to aid stricken Names


   By GILLIAN TETT


IN ANOTHER sign of the ripples that the record losses at Lloyd's are sending
through the art world, Christie's, the fine-art auctioneers, announced
yesterday that it had joined Coutts bank to provide a rescue package for
Lloyd's Names.
Under the scheme Names can raise a bank guarantee at Coutts for up to 40 per
cent of the value of their works of art.
The move comes as art dealers report a surge of inquiries from Names who are
seeking to sell art works and heirlooms to meet cash demands for the record
losses unveiled at Lloyd's last week - losses that have left the 27,770
Names facing average bills of Pounds 100,000.
A six-month cash advance on works of art to be sold at Christie's is
available for Names faced with immediate cashflow problems, Christie's
added.
Mr Anthony Browne, director of Christie's, denied yesterday that the move
was intended to rival a scheme which Sotheby's announced earlier this month.
