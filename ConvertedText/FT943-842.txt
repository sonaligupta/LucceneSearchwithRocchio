FT  27 SEP 94 / International Company News: Coles may cancel shares in
buy-back

Mr Peter Bartels, chief executive of Coles Myer, the Australian retailer,
said he prefered the option of cancelling a further 11.45 per cent of the
company's shares rather than sell the equity to a third party, writes Nikki
Tait in Sydney.
The question of what to do with the stake arises from Coles's decision to
buy back the 21.45 per cent interest in its shares which has been held by
Kmart, the Michigan-based retailer. Coles last week gained shareholder
approval for the ADollars 1.26bn (USDollars 920m) deal.
The transaction will take place in two parts. Coles will buy back and cancel
129m shares, or just under 10 per cent of the equity, for ADollars 586.9m.
But it has yet to resolve the question of what to do with the second tranche
of Kmart shares, covering 11.45 per cent of its stock.
Both tranches are being bought back by Coles at ADollars 4.55 a share, a
substantial premium to the company's closing price on Friday, which saw the
stock end 4 cents lower at ADollars 3.98.
