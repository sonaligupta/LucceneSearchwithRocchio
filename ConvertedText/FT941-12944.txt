FT  27 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Mixed retail fortunes


   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON


Further evidence of the mixed pattern of Christmas trading among the big
retail stores emerged yesterday as slightly disappointing results from WH
Smith contrasted with strong figures from Next.
Although Smith reported an increase in sales, profits came in towards the
bottom of market expectations and some brokers edged down full-year
forecasts. However, most took heart from the lower losses at Do It All, the
home improvement chain, and positive remarks from the Smith management on
trading.
WH Smith 'A' shares, marked sharply down initially on a hefty tax charge,
closed at 530 1/2 p, off 6 1/2 on the day. Turnover was a brisk 2.4m.
Next shares were also sold, but dealers attributed this to profit-taking
following the stock's sparkling new year run. Most of this was caused by
intense speculation of its sales increase over the Christmas period,
confirmed by yesterday's trading statement. Retail sales jumped 18 per cent
and Next Directory 9 per cent in the six months to the end of January.
Analysts' upgrades lifted profits forecasts some 5 per cent to around Pounds
70m. The shares eased 2 to 241p.
