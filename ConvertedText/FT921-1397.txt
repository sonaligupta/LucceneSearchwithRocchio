FT  24 MAR 92 / Punch may be about to receive its final blow


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


THE FUTURE of Punch, the UK's best-known humorous magazine, appeared
yesterday to be no laughing matter.
Mr David Thomas, the editor, moved quickly to exploit the uncertainty over
the publication's future by urging everyone to rush out and buy this week's
issue. 'If this week's is the last issue it will make a tremendous
souvenir,' he said. 'If it isn't going to be the last issue then the extra
sales will really save it.' Mr Thomas has been practising his gallows humour
since he became editor more than three years ago of the magazine, which was
founded 150 years ago.
He has spent his time in the editor's chair fighting a rearguard action
against declining circulation and the publication's association with
dentists' waiting rooms. He said yesterday that he had hear nothing about
its future.
Mr Graham Wilson, managing director of United Newspapers, which owns the
magazine, did not seem to be in a joking mood yesterday. 'No comment,' he
said.
The circulation of Punch, which has published humorists such as PG
Wodehouse, has not been a fit subject for humour for 50 years. From a
circulation peak of about 175,000 in the 1940s it fell below 100,000 in 1976
and reached 33,000 last year.
Mr Thomas said circulation has now reached 40,000. But whoever eventually
owns the magazine, the raucous humour of new-fangled publications such as
Viz and the sharper-edged satire and news of Private Eye will probably
continue to make it difficult for the wry smile of Mr Punch to shine
through.
