FT  03 AUG 92 / Pop goes the music business


   By JOEL KIBAZO and PETER JOHN


THE cancellation of Michael Jackson's Wembley concert on Saturday minutes
before he was due to perform to 72,000 people - may dent the star's image.
But it will cause only slight consternation to the music promoters that have
earned large fees from this summer's series of big pop concerts around the
country. The large number of events has helped to lift the spirits of
another industry knocked by the recession.
The Jackson concerts are among 40 large rock events recently staged around
the country, by bands such as Simply Red, Guns'n'Roses and Genesis, which
are expected to gross around Pounds 60m by the end of the summer.
The five-day Michael Jackson extravaganza which began last Thursday, is
expected to gross Pounds 12m - a figure that some small quoted companies
would be happy to make in a full year, and which equals the total for the
whole of 1991, when only three large acts played in the country.
Observers say this year's bonanza represents one of the last echoes of the
Gulf war. The previous summer was out because managers tend to book summer
tours in January or February. In January 1991 - in the midst of the Gulf war
 -nearly all the big US acts except Guns'n'Roses pulled out.
But, for all the glamour and glory of the mega-gigs, not even rock can
escape the ravages of recession. The signs have even been seen at concerts
once expected to generate strong demand. Nowhere was this more striking than
at a recent Stevie Wonder concert where the star played to a less than full
Wembley Arena - the smaller, indoor venue which has a capacity of 12,000.
For the last of Dire Straits' London concerts the promoters were forced to
resort to continuous radio advertising to boost interest.
The impact has been greater at smaller venues around the country although
some, such as the 3,500-seat Hammersmith Odeon in west London, say they have
benefited from increased bookings from bands frightened by the prospect of
playing at half empty, larger venues.
But it is records, cassettes and compact discs, the mainstay of the
industry, with retail sales in the UK last year of Pounds 1.26bn, that have
really suffered. According to figures from the industry's own trade
organisation, the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), in the four-year
period 1989 to 1992, albums delivered to retailers fell by 15.2 per cent,
and singles fell by 8.3 per cent. The most recent figures disclosed that the
downward trend was continuing with a 5.7 per cent fall in album deliveries
in the year to March 1992.
Mr Maurice Oberstein, chairman of PolyGram UK and current chairman of the
BPI, said: 'The music industry is not recession-proof. Young people who make
up a large part of our audience are usually the first to become unemployed.'
As well as unemployment, demographics have also had a part to play. A trade
still heavily geared to teenage consumption has had to contend with a fall
of 1.5m people within its target audience in the six years since 1986.
Computer games have proved strong competition. Nintendo, the expensive
Japanese video game, has increasingly displaced artists such as Def Leppard
in the affections of many teenagers.
Record companies have been forced to act. BMG Records, part of Bertelsmann,
the Dollars 9bn (Pounds 4.6bn)-a-year German entertainment group, which owns
the RCA and Arista labels, admits to having reduced its workforce by 40 to
300 over the past 18 months, a loss that included two managing directors.
Others have been forced to make similar cuts although, this being show
business, the illusion of all being well must at all times be maintained.
With the UK still in the grip of recession, predictions earlier in the year
by some in the industry of a return to the Christmas bonanza, traditionally
the most lucrative part of the year, now appear to be premature and
optimists have been forced to scale back expectations. This is a feeling
that some Michael Jackson fans only know too well.
