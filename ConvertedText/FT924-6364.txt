FT  21 NOV 92 / International Company News: Olympus in Y4.2bn patent payment
to Honeywell


   By CHARLES LEADBEATER


OLYMPUS, the leading Japanese camera maker, yesterday disclosed it had paid
Y4.2bn (Dollars 34.1m) to Honeywell, the US high technology group, to settle
a patent dispute over an automatic focus optical lens for cameras.
The company announced earlier this year it had settled the dispute, one of
several that Honeywell has successfully pursued against Japanese camera
manufacturers over their recently introduced automatic-focus cameras.
The payment was one of the main factors behind Olympus' Y275m after-tax loss
for the six months to the end of September. It made an after-tax profit of
Y3.7bn in the same period last year.
Olympus' pre-tax profits fell by 41.4 per cent for the first half of the
financial year to Y4.2bn, higher than its earlier estimates largely due to
its efforts to cut costs.
Turnover rose by 1.8 per cent to Y94bn, led by higher sales in Japan of a
new camera with a panoramic lens, and medical camera sales.
A cost-cutting drive helped to limit the drop in operating profits to a 1.5
per cent fall to Y6.8bn. A rise in financial costs, related to Olympus' bond
issues to raise additional capital, were the main reason for the fall in
pre-tax profits.
Kenwood, the Japanese audio equipment manufacturer, reported a 41 per cent
fall in interim pre-tax profits to Y1.8bn, on a 4.9 per cent increase in
turnover in the first half of the year.
