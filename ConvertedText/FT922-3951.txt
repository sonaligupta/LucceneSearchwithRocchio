FT  09 JUN 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (9): India's agents of
fortunes - History


   By JDF JONES


MERCHANTS OF THE RAJ by Stephanie Jones Macmillan Press Pounds 40, 434 pages
DR JONES has written two histories of the Inchcape Group and family - Two
Centuries of Overseas Trade and Trade and Shipping.
She now adds a curious, not-uninteresting, 'symposium' (the word is Lord
Inchcape's) of the story of Calcutta's distinctive managing-agency houses,
opening in the mid-19th century but concentrating on the period since the
second war, so it is essentially the tale of the decline and fall of a
significant element in Britain's imperial trading system.
The history of Britain's commercial role in India is an important and
interesting subject and more than that, these reminiscences of burra sahibs
and chummeries and racism in the Club have their charm.
However, the decision of Dr Jones to limit her ambitions to a long sequence
of chopped-up verbatim interviews with about 70 of the 'Number One'
businessmen, mostly retired, carries with it serious weaknesses, principally
that it is an abdication of the historian's duty to describe, to analyse,
and then to make an impartial third-party assessment of, in this case, the
strengths and weaknesses of the managing-agencies.
This is lazy history. To be fair, perhaps it was Lord Inchcape's brief to
her.
