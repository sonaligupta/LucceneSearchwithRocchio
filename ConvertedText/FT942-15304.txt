FT  15 APR 94 / International Capital Markets: Non-recourse loan facility
for BSkyB


   By ANTONIA SHARPE


In a move which reflects its stronger financial position, British Sky
Broadcasting (BSkyB), the UK-based satellite television venture, said
yesterday that it is raising Pounds 500m of non-recourse bank finance which
will enable it to repay loans from its shareholders.
The main shareholders of BSkyB, which has now moved into operating profit
but is still incurring large pre-tax losses, are News Corporation with 50
per cent, Pearson, the owner of the Financial Times, with 17.5 per cent, and
Granada with 13.5 per cent.
Part of the proceeds of the five-year revolving credit facility, which is
being arranged by Toronto-Dominion Bank and Citibank, will be used to repay
a Pounds 100m bank loan which was guaranteed equally by Pearson, Granada and
Chargeurs, the French transport and communication group which has also put
money into the venture.
The money will also be used to repay securities held directly by Pearson and
Granada and to release certain contingent liabilities.
The payments to shareholders will be in addition to the Pounds 100m they
have received since December from cash generated by BSkyB's operations.
Terms of the facility were not disclosed but bankers involved in the deal
said that such a transaction reflected BSkyB's healthier finances.
'Just one year ago, banks would not have considered taking part in such a
facility,' said one banker.
The two arranging banks are underwriting Pounds 250m of the amount and the
remainder will be syndicated among other banks.
