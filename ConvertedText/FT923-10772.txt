FT  29 JUL 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: Navigators for athletes


Olympics organisers are drafting in 'navigators' and taking other measures
to improve transport after complaints from teams about coach drivers who get
lost or are late.
The International Olympic Committee raised the problem with the Barcelona
organisers (COOB) after Germany and at least 14 other teams complained about
buses getting lost.
