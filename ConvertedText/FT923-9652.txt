FT  04 AUG 92 / International Company News: Chairman to quit Indonesian
company


   By WILLIAM KEELING


   JAKARTA


ASTRA International, Indonesia's second largest company, has announced that
Mr William Soeryadjaya, its chairman and main shareholder, is stepping down.
The move follows speculation that the Soeryadjaya family, which owns 76 per
cent of Astra, is preparing to sell up to half its stake.
Astra, which has a market capitalisation of Rp2,882bn (Dollars 1.4bn),
accounts for almost half of Indonesia's vehicle sales and, brokers say, is
among the country's best-run companies. There has been concern, however,
that Astra could be affected by losses suffered by Bank Summa, part of the
Summa Group privately-owned by the Soeryadjaya family.
Brokers say the Soeryadjaya family has recently injected more than Rp550bn
of capital into Bank Summa to compensate for a fall in value of property
investments. At a press conference last week, Mr Soeryadjaya said he wished
to concentrate fully on the Summa Group and to underline that no linkages
existed between the two businesses.
The new chairman of Astra is to be Mr Sumitro Djojohadikusumo, a former
Indonesian economy minister and close associate of President Suharto. Mr
Djojohadikusumo said he had consulted President Suharto and government
ministers before accepting the post.
Brokers recently downgraded 1992 net profit forecasts for Astra from Rp150bn
to about Rp120bn, as against Rp210bn last year. Sales in the first quarter
of this year were down 35 per cent on the same period of 1991.
Mr Djojohadikusumo's priority is likely to be the search for new investors.
Toyota vehicles make up about half of Astra's sales but Toyota has denied an
interest in buying a stake.
Astra is to hold an extraordinary meeting on September 18 to authorise
changes on its board.
