FT  30 JUN 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report


   By REUTER


PALLADIUM continued its recent strong performance on the London bullion
market. Dealers said that tightening Russian supplies were the cause of the
recent rally. They also noted good demand from Japan and North America. In
Chicago SOYABEANS were higher in fast early trading as a renewed round of
fund buying pushed prices to contract highs. Fundamentals were little
changed, traders said. Excessively wet weather in the western US Midwest
soyabean-
growing regions continues to plague the soyabean crop. New York raw SUGAR
was lower in all months at midsession with nearby months feeling the most
pressure on expectations for ample to abundant nearby supply. Analysts said
forecasts for tightening global supply later this year and into 1994 was
underpinning the back months. But uncertainty over how much would be
delivered against spot July, which comes off the board today, and continuing
sluggish demand in the cash market continued to undercut the front months.
London COCOA futures closed with modest losses as the market struggled to
consolidate after experiencing a downside technical correction.
