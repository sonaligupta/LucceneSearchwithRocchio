FT  27 JAN 94 / People: Storehouse selects Steele and Sorrell


After getting through three finance directors since 1990, Storehouse will be
hoping that its latest recruit to the position, Dick Steele, 38, right,
currently FD of Lloyds Chemists, may stay the course.
In addition to filling the FD's position which has been vacant since the
unexpected departure of Graham Rider last October, Steele's appointment from
April will give Storehouse a full board of four executives and four
non-executives for the first time for more than a year.
Bringing the management back to full strength has been one of the priorities
of chief executive Keith Edelman since he was appointed to the group last
summer.
Steele was appointed after an executive search and had no previous links
with Storehouse, but the group says it is sure that it now has the right
man.
'Clearly he has the qualities we are looking for,' says Storehouse. 'He has
first-class accounting skills and very strong retailing experience.'
Steele has a degree in economics and accountancy from Liverpool University
and qualified as an accountant with KPMG Peat Marwick. He joined fashion
retailer Next in 1984 and held a number of senior financial positions before
moving to Midsummer Leisure as group finance director in 1987. He became FD
of Lloyds Chemists in 1990.
Martin Sorrell, 48, chief executive of the marketing services group WPP, is
also joining the company, as a non-executive director, the first such post
he has notched up. Yesterday he said he did not wish to comment on his
reasons for making the move into previously uncharted waters.
