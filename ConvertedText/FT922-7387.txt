FT  19 MAY 92 / UK Company News: LOF shows 31% improvement to Dollars 2.67m


IN A VOLATILE trading environment, London & Overseas Freighters, the UK
tanker company, raised pre-tax profits by 31 per cent from Dollars 2.04m to
Dollars 2.67m (Pounds 1.5m) in the year to March 31 1992. Net freights and
hire income climbed 11 per cent to Dollars 11.65m.
With earnings per share at 11.9p (8.4p), the dividend has been raised from
1p to a recommended 1.25p. Cash flow remained strong at Dollars 5.91m and
debt was reduced by 33 per cent from Dollars 15m to Dollars 10m.
Market values of each of the company's tankers fell by 20 per cent from
Dollars 24.5m to Dollars 19.25m over the year.
The directors said that this year both the 'London Spirit' and 'London
Victory' would carry out their biennial repairs with a consequent loss of
earnings. This, together with increasing costs and borrowings associated
with the newbuilding vessel, would put pressure on operating margins over
the next year.
