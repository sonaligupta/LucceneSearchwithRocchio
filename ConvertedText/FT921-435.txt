FT  28 MAR 92 / International Company News: SocGen to leave central Paris


   By WILLIAM DAWKINS


   PARIS


SOCIETE Generale, the French commercial bank, is to move out of its
prestigious central Paris office and into a new FFr5bn (Dollars 883.3m)
headquarters, in the city's largest property transaction.
The spectacular deal gives a lift to the flagging property market in La
Defense, the modern business district on Paris' western boundary.
Societe Generale's new headquarters, to house 5,400 staff, will be two
38-storey tower blocks behind the Grande Arche, the square white marble arch
which forms the focal point of La Defense.
The move is to take place in three years.
However, the deal casts a shadow over the central Paris property market,
through the prospect of the 200,000 sq metres to come vacant as Societe
Generale's central services move out of their 50 offices spread across the
city.
The bank will keep a branch in its present headquarters in the Boulevard
Haussman, Paris' traditional banking district, but has not yet decided what
to do with the rest.
'This will certainly dynamise the market in La Defense, but it will increase
stocks in central Paris, even if over a long period,' said Mr Philippe
Bastien, analyst at James Capel.
Societe Generale's central Paris property portfolio was worth between
FFr10bn and FFr12bn, he estimated. That is roughly 30 per cent down on its
worth 18 months ago when the commercial property market started to go into
decline.
Recent transactions are at around FFr60,000 per sq metre, against around
FFr90,000 in mid-1990, sometimes rising to FFr120,000 for the best
locations.
Societe Generale could be expected to await an upturn and sell its
properties in small amounts so as to avoid weakening the market.
