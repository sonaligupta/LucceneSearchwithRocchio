FT  22 APR 91 / Readers' inquiry service


THE Financial Times has started a reader service in response to the growing
number of inquiries the newspaper receives each day.
The purpose of the service is to provide an efficient response to readers
who have questions about the contents of the newspaper or about specific
articles.
Simple requests for the dates of, or references to, articles in the FT will
normally be provided free, but a reasonable fee may be charged for copies of
articles, surveys or financial data.
Inquiries can be made by telephone on 071-873 4211 or by letter and will be
answered as soon as possible, usually on the same day. Inquiries can also be
made by fax to 071-873 3084.
Four researchers staff the service, which is open Monday to Friday, 9.30am
to midday and 2pm to 4.45pm. A call queue system is in operation.
If there is a charge for the information, payment will usually be by credit
card - all main credit cards are accepted - or by a cheque in advance.
Callers will be informed of the cost of the inquiry in advance and will be
asked to quote their credit card number.
