FT  07 JAN 94 / Observer: The height of absurdity


Scientists and statisticians have really got it in for short people. First
US eggheads tell us that taller members of a university class are more
likely to find spouses and get well-paid jobs than their shorter work mates.
Then their colleagues inform us that 18 of the last 22 men elected to be US
president were taller than their opponents.
British boffins are little kinder. What do we learn but that the average
British bishop is 1 3/4 inches taller than his parsons, while the Medical
Research Council warns that a 5ft tall man is twice as likely to suffer from
heart disease as a man 6ft tall.
Now, at an occupational psychology conference this week, another researcher
suggests that tall, thin men are more likely to succeed in management. Tuvia
Melamed of the University of Central Lancashire says that although tall, fat
women had just as good a chance as tall, thin ones, a trim waist was a
definite plus for men. He added: 'Generally the taller the person, the more
successful they are.'
