FT  20 APR 94 / Labour hints at utilities clampdown


   By DAVID OWEN


Labour was yesterday edging towards proposals for a radical overhaul of
utilities regulation after the party leadership endorsed parts of a leftwing
pamphlet urging the sacking of the present regulators.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, used an afterword in the
document to argue that the status quo was 'unacceptable' and that Labour
needed to devise 'a fresh approach'.
Mr Cook said he was 'persuaded of the case' for some of the changes
advocated by the pamphlet, but not of others. He did not specify which
proposals he was prepared to back.
The document - written by Mr Peter Hain, the leftwing Labour MP for Neath,
and published by the GMB general union - calls for the appointment of a
commission to bring the four utilities regulators under one umbrella.
It urges primary legislation to switch the determinants of policy away from
'competition-at-all-costs'. The new law would amend the objectives of each
regulator to 'ensure that policies to advance strategic national and social
interests always take precedence over promoting domestic competition or
shareholders' profits'.
The document urges the establishment of a Commons committee to scrutinise
the utilities. While it accepts that 'nationalisation is a thing of the
past', the pamphlet argues that the government could retain or take a
'golden share-type ownership stake' in some utilities, as well as appoint a
director and exert influence at board level.
The proposed utilities commission would be seen as an alternative to
renationalisation, the pamphlet argues.
According to Mr Hain, the activities of some of the regulators are 'at best
politically convenient. In some ways they seem to be pointing towards sleaze
factor.'
