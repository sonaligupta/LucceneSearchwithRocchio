FT  01 DEC 94 / International Company News: Matsushita acquires Nokia tube
factory


   By ALAN CANE


Matsushita Electronics Corporation, the Japanese electronics group, is to
acquire the picture tube factory of Nokia Consumer Electronics in Esslingen,
Germany.
The price is not being disclosed. Nokia, the Finland-based cellular
telephones, consumer electronics and telecommunications equipment
manufacturer, had said earlier this year that it intended to withdraw from
the picture tube manufacturing business, closing its Esslingen and Straubing
factories by the end of 1994.
Matsushita plans to refurbish the facility to manufacture up to 2m tubes a
year in Germany. It already makes 2.4m a year at its factories in the US,
1.2m in Malaysia and 2.6m in China. The German facility will deliver colour
tubes to Matsushita's factories and to other television manufacturers in
Europe.
Panasonic, Matsushita's consumer electronics brand, currently takes picture
tubes in Europe from Philips of the Netherlands and Thomson of France.
