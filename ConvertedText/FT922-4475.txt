FT  05 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Country Casuals seeks SE listing


   By RICHARD GOURLAY


COUNTRY CASUALS Holdings, a women's clothing manufacturer, yesterday joined
the growing number of companies seeking a quotation on the Stock Exchange.
The company, a 1989 management buy-in to the clothing chain previously owned
by Coats Viyella, is hoping to raise about Pounds 11m through a placement on
June 17 giving it a market capitalisation of between Pounds 20-Pounds 25m.
In the year to January 25, it made pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.01m, more
than double the previous year, on sales up 15 per cent at Pounds 36m (Pounds
31.3m).
Mr John Shannon, chairman and one of the three managers who paid Pounds
12.5m for the business, said the brand had been revived despite the
recession. This had been achieved via a strategy based on changes to the
design philosophy, the planning and production of the clothing range, the
imposition of tight management controls and employee motivation.
Continued progress would come via increased market share by raising the
number of outlets from the current 155 and through a new casual wear line
aimed at a broader market.
Country Casuals has already paid off most of the senior debt it borrowed
from the Bank of Scotland and is now broadly cash neutral. About Pounds 2.7m
of preference shares need to be redeemed.
Management put in Pounds 150,000 of the Pounds 2.85m capital, with the
balance provided by Invesco MIM, County NatWest Ventures and 3i, the venture
capital group owned by the high street banks.
After the flotation the buy-in team will have 30 per cent of the company.
Morgan Grenfell is sponsoring the placement and the brokers are County
NatWest.
Mr Shannon said he would be interested in acquiring another retail brand and
applying the same strategy as that which had turned Country Casuals around.
