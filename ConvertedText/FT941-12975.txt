FT  27 JAN 94 / International Company News: Inquiry urges reform of
Vancouver exchange


   By BERNARD SIMON

A commission of inquiry has urged sweeping regulatory reforms to improve the
image of the scandal-plagued Vancouver stock exchange (VSE).
But several key participants, including the VSE itself, have expressed
doubts whether the proposals, which include new supervisory bodies, will
achieve their desired goals.
Mr James Matkin, a prominent businessman who led the inquiry, said the VSE's
successes are overshadowed by 'shams, swindles and market manipulations'.
The report's main proposal is to transfer supervision of the VSE from the
British Columbia Securities Commission, a government agency, to an
independent Securities and Exchange Board, modelled on similar bodies in the
US and UK.
Mr Matkin said the commission has been 'too passive in its regulatory
activity, and preoccupied with the prosecution and adjudication of
securities abuse'.
The report also recommends that responsibility for disciplining errant
securities dealers be shifted from the VSE to Canada's Investment Dealers'
Association, a securities industry group. Brokerage firms would be required
to pass a 'fitness test'. A registration system and other controls would be
extended to stock promoters.
The VSE said the proposed new structure would result in 'a cumbersome,
fractured and expensive system that shows no promise of addressing the
market problems'.
