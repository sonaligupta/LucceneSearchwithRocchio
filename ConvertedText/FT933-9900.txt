FT  06 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sharp climb in India's output
is forecast

   BOMBAY


INDIA'S COFFEE output is set to rise 40 per cent to a record 225,000 tonnes
in crop year 1993-94 (October-September), which planters fear could cause a
glut, reports Reuter from Bombay.
In its 'blossoms estimate' for the new season, the state-run Coffee Board
put production at 101,000 tonnes of arabica and 124,000 tonnes of robusta
for the year, against this year's 79,300 and 82,000 tonnes respectively.
'The weather has been very good in most coffee-growing areas,' a United
Planters' Association of Southern India official said. He explained that the
coffee crop did well in alternate years. In 1991-92, output was 180,000
tonnes.
India has been exporting coffee freely after the collapse in 1989 of
International Coffee Agreement controls.
'There'll be a large surplus in the coming season,' said Mr Anil Bhandari, a
Coffee Board member and a planter from the southern state of Karnataka,
which accounts for the bulk of India's coffee.
In the first three months of the 1993-94 fiscal year (April-March) exports
fell to 17,614 tonnes, worth Rs659m (Pounds 14m) from 18,679 tonnes in the
same period of the previous year.
The government has fixed an annual export target of 120,000 tonnes, in spite
of only selling 113,150 tonnes in 1992-93, worth Rs3.79bn.
Mr Bhandari said world coffee prices had begun to look up and were again an
incentive for India to step up exports. 'In this changed scenario, I think
we can easily export the targeted 120,000 tonnes,' he said.
But analysts have observed that stagnating domestic consumption at 60,000
tonnes will not help India reduce surpluses.
