FT  27 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Hoskins in takeover talks


Hoskins Brewery is in talks which might lead to a substantial acquisition.
Part of the consideration would be met by the issue of new shares.
Hoskins said the acquisition would be coupled with a pre-conditional cash
offer for all of the company's issued share capital at 55p per share.
The making of the offer would be conditional on the notice to convene an EGM
to approve the acquisition being posted to shareholders.
Hoskins anticipated that certain shareholders would not accept such an
offer, if made, and said that any Hoskins ordinary shares in respect of
which acceptances of the offer may be received, would be placed with
institutions and others at 55p per share.
