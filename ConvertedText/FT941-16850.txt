FT  07 JAN 94 / 10% of Elf for core investors


   By JOHN RIDDING

A group of long-term stable investors will hold 10 per cent of the shares in
Elf-Aquitaine, the French oil group, following its privatisation, Mr Edmond
Alphandery, the economy minister, has announced.
The privatisation, which will be launched this month, is the largest so far
in the government's plan to sell 21 public sector groups. The sale of the
majority of the government's 50.8 per cent stake in Elf, France's largest
industrial company, is expected to raise up to FFr40bn (Pounds 4.6bn).
Speaking at a business conference, Mr Alphandery said 1.5 per cent of Elf's
shares would be taken by Union des Assurances de Paris, France's largest
insurance group which is already an investor in the oil company.
A tender for the other 8.5 per cent of Elf's shares allotted to core
investors will be launched this weekend. UAP is expected to be joined in
Elf's 'noyau dur' of stable investors by a number of France's leading
financial and industrial groups. These include Banque Nationale de Paris,
first to be privatised last year, AXA, the insurance group, Paribas, the
investment bank, and Suez, the financial and industrial holding company.
Renault, the state-owned carmaker, also slated for privatisation, is another
likely investor. Its industrial alliances with Elf include collaboration in
Formula 1 car racing.
The government will retain between 10 and 15 per cent of Elf's shares
through Erap, the state holding company. Through a golden share it will have
a veto over the sale of some assets, and investors seeking to raise stakes
above thresholds of 10, 20 and 33.3 per cent will need official approval.
Mr Alphandery said privatisation would continue at a steady pace. Next on
the list of candidates is UAP.
