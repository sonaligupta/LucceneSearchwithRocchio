FT  11 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei ahead as Bangkok
falls 1.9 per cent


   By EMIKO TERAZONO


   TOKYO


A rise in the government bond market and a fall in the yen encouraged
investors, and the Nikkei 225 average advanced 1.3 per cent on arbitrage
buying, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index gained 251.52 at 20,090.71 after a day's low of 19,880.59, and
high of 20,114.41 just before the close. Foreigners were active buyers in
the afternoon, drawing in domestic individuals and dealers.
Hopes of an easing of tension between the US and Japan over trade also
prompted buying. There was speculation that Mr Ichiro Ozawa, shadow
co-ordinator of the coalition government, would visit the US in an effort to
defuse the trade row. Investors were also cheered by reports that Motorola
and Ido, a Japanese mobile phone company, had reached agreement on increased
foreign access to Japan's mobile phone market.
Concern over the large arbitrage overhang, ahead of the March options and
futures settlements today, subsided following the decline in the balance of
arbitrage positions during the past few days.
Volume amounted to 400m shares, against Wednesday's 332m. Rises led declines
by 649 to 377, with 149 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first
section stocks put on 11.02 at 1,616.51 and the Nikkei 300 added 2.37 at
298.27. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 4.19 firmer at 1,345.83.
Telecom-related stocks gained ground after fears of trade sanctions by the
US receded. Nitsuko, the most active issue of the day, forged ahead Y150 to
Y1,650 and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone advanced Y13,000 to Y945,000.
Hopes of an increase in revenue supported brokerage issues. Nomura
Securities rose Y90 to Y2,320 and Nikko Securities Y50 to Y1,330. Banks were
lower on profit-taking. Sakura Bank fell Y40 to Y1,370.
Bakery and flour mill shares, which had advanced on speculation of benefits
from increased bread consumption due to the latest rice shortage, also
declined on profit-taking. Yamazaki Baking retreated Y40 to Y2,160 and Nitto
Flour Milling Y11 to Y569.
Higher gold bullion prices supported mining shares. Mitsui Mining and
Smelting moved forward Y10 to Y405 and Sumitomo Metal Mining Y30 to Y891.
In Osaka, the OSE average added 137.95 at 22,028.33 in volume of 129m
shares.
Roundup
Trading was largely lacklustre in the region, but technical factors provided
impetus in some markets. Bombay was closed.
BANGKOK fell 1.9 per cent as banks were sold amid growing worries about
their profitability after the central bank's move to raise provisions for
doubtful debt. The SET index shed 26.17 to 1,332.39.
SEOUL began gearing up for a rally on plans to ease deposit restrictions on
investors' stock orders. Under the new regulations, institutional investors
will only need to deposit 20 per cent of the value of buy orders instead of
the current 40 per cent. The composite index edged up 0.73 to 878.58.
AUSTRALIA mustered a rise, although the market was dogged by directionless
trading. The All Ordinaries index put on 8.3 points at 2,155.1 in moderate
turnover of ADollars 480m.
NEW ZEALAND bounced after Wednesday's fall, the NZSE 40 Capital index rising
22.54 to 2,228.74 in thin trading.
MANILA also rallied, although turnover fell sharply as the mood remained
cautious. The composite index moved ahead 50.39, or 2 per cent, to 2,552.84.
HONG KONG was lower as investors adopted a wait-and-see attitude. The Hang
Seng index dipped 95.33 to 10,129.05 in thin turnover of HKDollars 4.14bn.
SINGAPORE was weakened by interest rate worries. The Straits Times
Industrial index breached the psychologically important 2,200 support level,
falling 28.75 to 2,194.10.
KUALA LUMPUR extended losses at the close as investors further liquidated
positions due to lack of leads from abroad and ahead of the long Hari Raya
holiday next week. The composite index slipped 10.43 to 1,046.0.
COLOMBO was again marked lower, the all-share index shedding 17.62 to
1,328.68 and taking the market's cumulative correction over the last week to
3 per cent, after a near 40 per cent rise since the start of the year.
