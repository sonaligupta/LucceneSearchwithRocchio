FT  12 MAR 92 / Commanding lead bolsters Clinton: After Super Tuesday
Arkansas governor has twice as many committed delegates as Tsongas


   By GEORGE GRAHAM


   TALLAHASSEE, FLORIDA


GOVERNOR Bill Clinton of Arkansas now holds a commanding lead in the battle
for delegates to the Democratic convention in New York in July, which will
decide the party's presidential nominee.
With results in from the 11 states that held presidential primaries and
caucuses on Super Tuesday, Mr Clinton has got the bulk of the delegates from
seven states, including heavily populated Texas and Florida. He now has more
than twice as many delegates committed to him as his closest rival, former
Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts.
Former Governor Jerry Brown of California continued to win respectable
minorities of the votes in many states, but ranks far behind in delegates.
President George Bush, who swept all eight states holding Republican
primaries on Tuesday, has almost 10 times as many delegates as Mr Patrick
Buchanan, his Republican right-wing challenger.
But both Mr Clinton and Mr Bush are a long way from victory. Mr Clinton is
only about a third of the way towards the total 2,144 delegates he needs to
ensure the Democratic nomination on the first ballot.
He cannot achieve this before mid-May and appears unlikely to clinch the
nomination until June, the last big primary day. Mr Bush is half-way towards
the total of 1,105 delegates he needs for the Republican nominating
convention in August in Houston. Mathematically, he too cannot eliminate his
challenger for some weeks.
Bush campaign officials believe they have baulked Mr Buchanan's best chances
of winning a state. Mr Buchanan, a former Nixon speechwriter, saw his share
of the vote fall in several states well below the 30 per cent level he has
previously achieved. In Mississippi, Mr Buchanan had to split the right-wing
and racist vote with Mr David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader, and
scored only 17 per cent. In Texas and Tennessee, he scored less than 25 per
cent, although Tennessee - one of the rare Republican states which does not
use a winner-takes-all system for allotting delegates - also provided him
with one of his best harvests of delegates to the Houston convention.
But the Buchanan-Duke combination continued to eat into Mr Bush's vote. In
no single state - even his adopted home of Texas - was the president able to
reach 75 per cent of the Republican vote.
Mr Tsongas sought on Tuesday to play down the significance of Mr Clinton's
victory. 'He won on his home turf and I won on my home turf. The only state
which was neutral territory was Delaware, and I won that,' he said.
This claim might have some foundation were it not for the size of Mr
Clinton's victory in Florida. Although loosely described as a southern
state, Florida is much farther - both geographically and demographically -
from Arkansas than Delaware is from Mr Tsongas's native Massachusetts.
"This is not a regional state, this is a diverse state,' said Mr Jeff Eller,
Governor Clinton's Florida campaign manager. Mr Eller said he was hoping
last week for a 5 to 8 percentage point margin of victory, and described
Tuesday's 15 point margin as 'a rout'.
