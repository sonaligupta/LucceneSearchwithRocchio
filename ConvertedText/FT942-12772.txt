FT  28 APR 94 / Lilley defends tax incentives


   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent


Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, yesterday defended the
government's administration of the personal pensions programme which has
cost taxpayers billions of pounds more than expected.
He said that his predecessors were right to offer tax incentives to
individuals to contract out of the state earnings-related pension scheme.
'This was intended to get the scheme off the ground,' he told the Commons
social security committee. 'Figures suggest that most of those (who have
contracted out) have been wise to do so.'
DSS figures show that about Pounds 10.5bn in tax rebates has been paid to
personal pension holders since 1987.
Last December, the DSS published figures showing that more than 300,000
people were too old to benefit from having contracted out of Serps while
nearly 40 per cent of personal pension holders had incomes so low that the
rebates would be significantly reduced by life insurers' levies for
expenses.
