FT  19 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Baird sells contracting arm for Pounds 10m


   By DANIEL GREEN


William Baird yesterday sold most of its engineering contracting arm to a
rival, Cape, controlled by Charter Consolidated, for Pounds 9.5m.
At the same time it announced the purchase from the receiver of the designs
and trade marks of Van Gils, a Belgian men's wear label, for Pounds 600,000.
The moves are the latest stage in Baird's move away from engineering towards
textiles.
'The returns on capital in contracting have not met our expectations,' said
Mr Andrew Mills-Baker, finance director.
Darchem Contracting had 1991 sales of Pounds 37m and operating profits of
Pounds 0.9m. The businesses sold were the UK and Middle East arms of the
company. Baird retains the Darchem name and some activities in Australasia.
