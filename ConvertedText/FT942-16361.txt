FT  11 APR 94 / A long walk for the shops: A saturated home market is
forcing US retailers to look for growth opportunities abroad


   By RICHARD TOMKINS


When US retailers start expanding overseas, something must be wrong at home.
By and large, ever since the nation's first trading post opened, US store
groups have held the view that the domestic market offers such vast
potential for growth that there is no need to look anywhere else.
Listen, for example, to Mr Leslie Wexner, chairman and chief executive of
The Limited, the US fashion retailer, rejecting the idea of international
expansion in his company's last annual report: 'I believe that our customers
and shareholders are best served when we focus on our immense opportunities
in the US. Sales of Dollars 10bn, perhaps Dollars 20bn, are within our
grasp, right here. Considering the complexities of retailing overseas, I do
not yet see similar volume and profit opportunities from global expansion.'
Yet suddenly, sentiments like these are beginning to sound out of date. Toys
R Us, the toy superstore group, has already opened in 15 countries outside
North America and plans to add Denmark, Sweden, Saudi Arabia and the United
Arab Emirates to the list this year. Kmart, the discount store operator, has
bought 13 stores in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, and is about to open
two stores in Singapore. Price/Costco, the membership warehouse company, is
already in Canada, Mexico and the UK, and plans to open stores in Taiwan and
Korea this year.
This is not the first time US retailers have explored overseas. Woolworth
took its 'five-and-dime' variety stores to the UK and Germany in the 1920s,
and there have been sporadic adventures by US companies since. But the
current interest is on a much bigger scale than anything seen before.
From the US retailer's point of view, the most satisfactory explanation is
that this is a case of sheer opportunism. US retailers are among the most
innovative in the world, at the forefront of developing new shopping formats
such as discount stores, speciality superstores and electronic home
shopping. It would be more surprising if they failed to exploit that
competitive advantage overseas, particularly when trade barriers are
falling.
But there is another factor driving them to do what they have so rarely seen
as necessary in the past: the US no longer provides the opportunity for
seemingly limitless growth. Over the years, retail square footage has
increased so rapidly that the market has become saturated. If the market
itself were growing, this might matter less: but, notwithstanding an upward
blip in sales reported by some US stores groups last week, retail sales have
barely changed in real terms over the past five years.
Worse, few can see a day when the growth rates of the past will return, even
when people have more money in their pockets. Partly, this is because the US
population is ageing, and older people spend less in the shops. But industry
analysts say the bigger factor is the sociological trend that the consumer
excesses of the 1980s have given way to a new era of thrift and
conservatism.
According to Mr Ed Meyer, chairman and chief executive of the New York
agency Grey Advertising, US consumers are reassessing their lives in the
1990s in much the same way as US companies are re-engineering their
businesses. 'They are putting the brake on their whole approach to living,'
he told a retailing conference in New York. 'They are not just limiting
their spending; they are cutting back on their wants and their needs.'
Whether or not Mr Meyer is right, the fact remains that almost the only
opportunity for a retailer to increase sales in the current state of the US
market is to capture market share at someone else's expense.
Yet the competitive pressures have become so intense that few companies
introducing a successful format can hope to keep their edge for long. One of
two things tends to happen: everyone jumps on the bandwagon, leading to
saturation of the emergent sector, or someone comes along with a better
idea.
Take warehouse clubs - the big retailing phenomenon of the 1980s. Mr Sol
Price, inventor of the concept, had barely opened his first warehouse before
other operators moved into the market. By the end of the decade there were
too many warehouses for too few customers, profits began to dwindle, and a
wave of consolidation set in. Last year Mr Price's ailing warehouse
operation was taken over by the rival Costco, to form Price/Costco.
Or look at electronic home shopping, one of the latest retailing formats. As
currently understood, this means parading goods on television shopping
channels and inviting viewers to place a telephone order. But already this
concept is obsolescent. The new home shopping channels about to be
introduced will be interactive, allowing viewers to choose what goods they
want to look at, and order them at the push of a button through automatic
debiting of their credit card.
With so little potential for domestic growth, the arrival of each new store
group and each new concept further saturates the market, with predictable
consequences for the weakest. According to an analysis by Salomon Brothers,
the Wall Street investment bank, more than half the top 20 US discount
department stores that existed in 1980 are no longer around.
Small wonder that US retailers are looking for growth opportunities beyond
their traditional market. There are few big store groups today that are not
at least considering international expansion. Some are attracted by the
cultural similarities of western Europe, and others by the growth potential
of eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia.
Most, however, seem to favour dipping a cautious a toe into neighbouring
Canada or Mexico first. Wal-Mart, the discount store group which is the
world's biggest retailer, has just bought 120 Woolco stores from Woolworth's
Canadian subsidiary, while JC Penney, the department store group, is opening
its first three international stores in Mexico this year.
But will it work? Few previous US ventures into overseas retailing have
survived. Most, coincidentally, ended in the 1980s. Woolworth sold its UK
general merchandise stores; Sears Roebuck pulled out of Spain and Latin
America; JC Penney sold its Sarma stores in Belgium; Safeway sold its UK
supermarkets after a leveraged buy-out; Schering-Plough sold its worldwide
Scholl chain; Singer sold its worldwide chain of sewing machine shops; Tandy
demerged its electronics shops outside the US; Zale sold its UK jewellery
shops; and Wickes went bankrupt, leaving its European do-it-yourself stores
to fend for themselves.
Today's adventurers acknowledge that expansion abroad has its perils. Mr
Larry Bouts, international division president of Toys R Us, says it is a
brave company that risks taking its eye off the ball in the competitive US
market to start up overseas; and companies entering the European market need
nerves of steel to contemplate the much higher costs of property, labour and
distribution there. Mr Warren Hashagen, senior vice-president (finance) of
The Gap, the fashion store chain, says the dilemma faced by retailers going
anywhere abroad is that they have to adapt their formula to suit local
conditions, yet in doing so they risk undermining whatever it was that made
them successful in the first place.
It might all be different this time though. Woolworth was profitable in the
UK for decades before its retailing formula became outdated, and the company
is still in overseas markets as a speciality retailer with its Foot Locker
sports shoe chain. Other US retailers entering overseas markets are more
aggressive and experienced than their predecessors. In the food service
sector, the phenomenal success of McDonald's has demonstrated that US
products and US retailing techniques can prove a devastating combination
when applied effectively. Retailers of the world, beware.
