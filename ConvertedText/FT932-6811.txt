FT  27 MAY 93 / World News In Brief: Pier Giorgio Romiti / Correction


A photograph of Mr Pier Giorgio Romiti, managing director of Gilardini,
Fiat's space division, was incorrectly used in some editions of yesterday's
Financial Times in conjunction with a report of investigations by Milan
magistrates into alleged corruption involving Fiat. We offer him our sincere
apologies for any embarrassment caused by the error.
