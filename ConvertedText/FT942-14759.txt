FT  19 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Drawbacks to share option procedures


   From Mr DAVID M W BROOKS


Sir, I refer to your article, 'Avoid the BP trap' (Management, April 15),
concerning the need for executive pay and, in particular, share options to
be linked to performance measures.
The article indicated that some companies may select the criterion that
share options will become exercisable if a company's earnings beat inflation
by 2 per cent in three successive years. This approach has two principal
problems.
First, the joint statement by the National Association of Pension Funds and
the Association of British Insurers requires companies to choose performance
measures which will produce 'significant and sustained improvement in
underlying financial performance'. That implies that a company must consider
measures that are appropriate to themselves and not simply adopt a measure
because other companies are doing so.
Second, chairmen of remuneration committees may well have to justify to
shareholders in the future why substantial gains from share options have
been realised when the above earnings performance measure has been beaten,
but where a company's performance compared to its sector or the FT-SE 100 is
very poor.
If the link between corporate performance and executive remuneration is to
become meaningful, the use of industry standards is dangerous. In the
current environment, companies should question why they have share options
if they have not chosen performance measures appropriate to their specific
circumstances.
