FT  21 JUL 94 / International Company News: Oceonics Group falls to Pounds
1.3m loss


Oceonics Group, the Norfolk-based survey services group, reported a slide
into pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.28m in the year ended March 31.
There were profits of Pounds 1.61m last time, restated for FRS 3.
The company said the operating environment continued to worsen in the second
half, particularly in the North Sea.
It had also suffered a slowing in business in Nigeria since December because
of the political climate.
However, new orders had been won in South Africa, and a new base established
in Cape Town, directors said.
Current trading remained difficult and operating losses continued, they
added, although action had been taken to maintain overheads at an
appropriate level.
They looked forward to a better trading environment in 1995.
Turnover slipped to Pounds 24.1m (Pounds 30.7m) and operating losses
amounted to Pounds 1.29m (Pounds 2.23m profits).
Losses per share emerged at 1.6p (0.2p earnings).
The second tranche of dividend arrears relating to the preference shares
redeemed last year is being delayed and the company is unable to pay the
convertible preference share dividend.
