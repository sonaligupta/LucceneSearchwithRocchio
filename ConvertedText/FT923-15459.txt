FT  02 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Refocused Wilton makes Pounds 39,000


   By KATRINA LOWE


WILTON Group, the USM-quoted company which is moving out of property
investment to concentrate on the activities of its Glenchewton subsidiary,
formerly Cowan de Groot, reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 39,000 for
1991.
This compared with a Pounds 1.08m loss previously, before Wilton raised its
holding in the toys, electrical components, hardware and housewares group
from 29 per cent to 69.9 per cent. Sales jumped to Pounds 19.2m (Pounds
4.27m).
Glenchewton reported results for the eight months to December 31, bringing
its accounting period in line with its parent. A pre-tax loss of Pounds
275,000 was taken on sales of Pounds 20.6m. The 12 months to April 30 1991
ended with pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.13m on sales of Pounds 31.6m.
Wilton has made an extraordinary provision of Pounds 2.72m for property
disposals. These disposals, together with the Pounds 1.5m placing in
January, are intended to cut debt. A capital reconstruction is also planned.
Wilton's losses per share for the year were 0.002p (0.26p) and Glenchewton's
for the eight months were 1.54p (2.99p earnings).
Glenchewton has agreed to sell EWL Electric, an Irish Republic-based
importer and distributor of electrical products, for IPounds 2.26m (Pounds
2.07m). The purchaser is Edmundson Electrical, part of Marlowe Holdings,
which itself holds 15 per cent of Glenchewton.
