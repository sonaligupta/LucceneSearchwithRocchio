FT  24 MAR 92 / ITC to seek bids for Channel 5


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


THE Independent Television Commission said yesterday it intended soon to
advertise the licence for Channel 5, the new television channel.
Channel 5 will cause interference on video recorders and home computers, and
the successful bidder will have to pay for retuning all the affected
equipment. The plans were suspended while the commission considered how
bidders would cope with this.
The ITC said yesterday comments from potential applicants 'indicated that
the extent of the retuning problems is recognised and that serious
consideration has been given to solving them'.
The licence will now be advertised in early April with the intention to
award it by the end of October.
The winner is expected to be on air in part of the country by the end of
1994, and some viewers will need new aerials. The applicants will include Mr
Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest and FiveTV, a consortium supported by Canadian
broadcaster Mr Moser Znaimer.
