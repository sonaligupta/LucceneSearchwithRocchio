FT  30 APR 94 / UK Company News: Norman Hay deeper in red


Exceptional costs of Pounds 2.6m to cover reorganisation of its Coventry
factory left Norman Hay, the engineer, deeper in the red for the year to
end-December.
At the pre-tax level the deficit widened from Pounds 3.05m to Pounds 3.82m
and losses per share rose from 19.75p to 25.43p. Turnover was down at Pounds
7.84m (Pounds 9.52m).
The directors said the actions taken had radically improved Hay's operating
performance and provided a base from which to rebuild its fortunes. A number
of acquisition opportunities are being considered.
