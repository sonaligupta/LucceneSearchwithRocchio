FT  24 NOV 92 / Czechoslovakia in new divorce move


   By ANTHONY ROBINSON


THE tri-cameral Czechoslovak federal assembly will try again today to
terminate the Czech and Slovak federation legally. Last week the Slovak part
of the chamber of nations, the bi-cameral lower house, failed by three votes
to approve the country's 'velvet divorce.'
Czech and Slovak authorities have in the meantime finalised many technical
issues raised by separate statehood.
One agreement makes the Czech and Slovak governments jointly and separately
responsible for the Dollars 200m three-year, 9 per cent notes issued by the
Czechoslovak State Bank in November 1991. The notes mature in November 1994
but require the bank to repay capital and due interest in case of default.
The technical grounds for default include dissolution of the Czech and
Slovak federal republic or the state bank. Both will take place on January 1
when two separate states and two separate central banks will emerge from the
old federation.
However, the state bank has organised a noteholders' meeting on December 14
in London at which they will be offered a choice between redeeming any notes
tendered by December 11 or retaining the notes on the original terms but
with the addition of a dual guarantee from the Czech and Slovak governments.
