FT  02 NOV 93 / Industry may face Dollars 4bn bill to clean US rivers


   By LISA BRANSTEN


   WASHINGTON


THE US Environmental Protection Agency proposed tough new regulations on
pulp and paper makers yesterday in an attempt to clean up US rivers.
The regulations, which might cost US industry more than Dollars 4bn (Pounds
2.6bn) in capital expenditure, would call upon pulp and paper mills to
'virtually eliminate' dioxin discharges to rivers and cut toxic air
emissions by 70 per cent.
Dioxin enters the human food supply when it is absorbed by fish in
contaminated rivers. Under the terms of the Clean Water Act, the EPA must
take both economic and public-health effects into account when setting
environmental policy.
EPA officials estimate that 350 mills might be affected by the proposals.
Environmentalists and industry leaders were quick to criticise the new plan
yesterday.
The paper industry opposed the regulations, saying they would hurt the
economy, cost jobs and threaten the fledgling recycling industry.
The American Forest and Paper Association estimated that the regulations
would close 30 mills, leaving 19,000 mill workers without jobs and possibly
causing the loss of 250,000 related jobs.
Mr Red Cavaney, president of the AFPA, said the proposed changes would
divert resources from capital expansion and productivity improvements for
'insignificant environmental benefits'.
Mr David Bailey, a lawyer with the Environmental Defence Fund, said the
regulations would not go far enough to prevent dioxin from entering food
supplies and water life, and that the EPA standard for allowable emissions
was still too high.
