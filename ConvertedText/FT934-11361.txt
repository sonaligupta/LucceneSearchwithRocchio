FT  01 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Building societies 'more soundly' based


   By ALISON SMITH


BUILDING societies' pre-tax profits were significantly higher in the first
half of this year than for the comparable period of 1992, according to a
survey of societies' interim results.
While the profits were almost identical to those for the second half of
1992, the survey argues that they are now more soundly based.
That is because they do not rely on the opportunity that sterling's
departure from the European exchange rate mechanism gave societies for
improving their profits by widening their interest margins through reducing
mortgage rates more slowly than interest rates.
Mr Peter Welch of Multistrategies research, the report's author, argues that
the interim results should include a summary balance sheet in order to make
it easier to calculate a society's overall profitability.
Six of the 13 societies which publish interim results do so now, but it is
not required by the Stock Exchange. The survey is available from
Multistrategies, 2 Ridgmount Street, London WC1E 7AA, price Pounds 50.
