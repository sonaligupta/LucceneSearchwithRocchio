FT  27 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Nationwide takes over at Quality Street


   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent


Quality Street, the Glasgow-based company which owns and manages private
rented housing in many parts of Britain, has brought in the Nationwide
Building Society as its majority shareholder in a restructuring which it
said gave it a stable basis for growth.
The Nationwide has converted Pounds 50m of lending to Quality Street into
non-voting preference shares and now controls 75 per cent of the company,
with the rest held mainly by Mr Paul Mugnaioni, chairman, and its
management.
Quality Street will also take over the management of about 2,000 houses
repossessed by the society. They will be brought into the private rented
sector using business expansion scheme funds recently raised by Nationwide.
Quality Street will become Nationwide's main vehicle in rented housing.
Nationwide took 25 per cent of Quality Street's equity when it was formed in
1988 and earmarked funds to finance its properties. In 1991 it sold its
equity stake to Mr Mugnaioni and another director but continued to lend to
it.
Quality Street manages about 3,000 properties of which it owns about 2,000
and sees itself as a 'blue-chip' private landlord. But its balance sheet for
the year to March 31 1993, published yesterday, showed a deficit of Pounds
45.7m mainly because of the fall in property values.
Although the company made an operating profit of Pounds 6.5m (Pounds 5m)
thanks to rental income, this became a pre-tax loss of Pounds 28m (Pounds
9.4m) after a property write-down of Pounds 18m and additional interest and
redemption premiums on loans from Nationwide.
As a result of the new deal, which has been under negotiation since last
summer, Quality Street's indebtedness to Nationwide falls from Pounds 171m
to Pounds 121m in the pro forma balance sheet, leaving a surplus of Pounds
4.2m after taking assets into account.
Nationwide's remaining loans to Quality Street will be restructured and
Nationwide representatives will join Quality Street's board.
