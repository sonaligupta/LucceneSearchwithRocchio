FT  07 MAR 94 / Japan draws up trade response


   By WILLIAM DAWKINS


   TOKYO


Japan's divided ruling coalition will this week hold an emergency cabinet
meeting in an attempt to decide market opening measures in response to the
latest increase in US trade pressure, writes William Dawkins in Tokyo.
This follows US President Bill Clinton's decision last week to revise the
Super 301 provision of US trade law, which gives the US power to impose
trade sanctions on countries unfairly impeding its exports. That was a
consequence of the deadlock between Washington and Tokyo on ways to reduce
Japan's trade surplus and increase demand for imports.
The Japanese government aims to take firm decisions on further steps to open
its market to imports by the end of March, said Mr Tsutomu Hata, foreign
minister.
