FT  21 JUL 94 / World Trade News: JIB advises Oresund


   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES


   STOCKHOLM


Jardine Construction Services, a London-based division of the international
insurance broker JIB Group, has been appointed the insurance broker and risk
management adviser for the Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.6bn) project to build a
bridge and tunnel link across the Oresund, one of Europe's biggest
construction projects, writes Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm.
The 17km road and rail link between Malmo in Sweden and Copenhagen in
Denmark was given the final go-ahead last month.
The group will be responsible for placing the construction and third party
liability risks with leading international insurers before building work
begins next year.
