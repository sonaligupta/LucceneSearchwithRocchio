FT  20 APR 91 / Packaging goes green in Germany


   By DAVID GOODHART


   BONN


GERMANY yesterday passed a law to require packaging manufacturers and
retailers to take back used bottles, cans, cartons and general packaging
material, writes David Goodhart in Bonn.
Mr Klaus Topfer, environment minister, said that the law, which yesterday
was passed by the Bundesrat (upper house), would reduce Germany's household
rubbish from 30m to 18m tonnes a year.
Packaging manufacturers and retailers will have to mark with a green blob
all products that can be returned. By 1995, this should apply to 80 per cent
of packaging.
The complex law will be introduced in stages between December 1 1991 and
January 1 1993. From April 1 1992, purchasers will have the right to leave
superfluous packaging at the point of sale.
The Bundestag has blocked a bill designed to plug the loopholes in Germany's
export controls which have allowed German manufacturers to play a large role
in arming Third World dictators.
The German postal service will have to provide only DM4bn (Pounds 1.3bn),
rather than the planned DM8bn, up to 1994 to cover German unity costs.
