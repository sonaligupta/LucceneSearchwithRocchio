FT  14 APR 94 / People: New Clerical chairman


Next week, after 30 years as a non-executive director of Clerical Medical,
Michael Hamilton (below) will take over as chairman of the mutual life
insurer.
Formerly senior partner at City law firm Taylor Garrett - now part of Taylor
Joynson Garrett - his long association with Clerical Medical began when he
was invited to join the board by Lord Geddes, then chairman, for whom he had
done some work on shipbuilding contracts.
Hamilton does not intend to emulate the 15 years-plus in the chair of Sir
Douglas Morpeth, his predecessor, expecting instead to retire in three
years' time when he is 70. He estimates his new role will take up one to two
days a week.
While Clerical Medical still regards its main distribution channel as
independent financial advisers, it is also in the process of building up a
direct sales force, though this is still in a pilot stage at present.
Hamilton sees the direct sales force and prospects for doing business
overseas as the main areas of opportunity for the company in the coming
years.
The main problem he feels is keeping costs down - both in terms of the
company and also in ensuring that the regulatory regime for life companies
is itself cost-effective.
