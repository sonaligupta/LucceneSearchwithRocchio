FT  16 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Electricity companies merge retail and
repair operations


   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO


SOUTH WESTERN Electricity and South Wales Electricity are merging their
retailing and appliance repair businesses into a new company, SWEB Retail.
The new company will be 80 per cent controlled by South Western Electricity,
which will contribute 43 of SWEB's 67 retail outlets. The balance of the
shares will go South Wales Electricity, which has also retained the right to
sell its minority shareholding to South Western after 1996 for an estimated
asset value of about Pounds 4m to Pounds 5m.
Annual turnover for the new company, which is planned to come into effect in
early April, is expected to be in the region of Pounds 70m.
The freehold and leasehold property rights will remain with the parent
companies.
Mr David Jones, managing director of South Wales Electricity, said that the
utility had been reviewing its retail business for some time.
The merger with South Western's retailing operations would provide it with
an opportunity to move out of a business that was not profitable. In the six
months to end-September, South Wales' retailing business incurred a loss of
about Pounds 1m on turnover of just over Pounds 20m.
For South Western, the merger would enable it to increase volume, which, in
electrical retailing, is crucial to profitability. South Western only came
close to break even at the interim stage last year.
Mr Jones said the merger would lead to significant cost reductions through
the elimination of 80 to 90 jobs, the rationalisation of warehouses,
nationalisation of infrastructure and joint purchasing benefits.
