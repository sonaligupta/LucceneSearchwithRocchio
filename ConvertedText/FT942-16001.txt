FT  13 APR 94 / Russia and Ukraine in gas deal


   By REUTER


   MOSCOW


Russia and Ukraine yesterday reached an agreement under which Kiev will
clear its huge debt arrears to the Russian gas company Gazprom by July,
Reuter reports from Moscow.
Mr Rem Vyakhirev, Gazprom head, announced the agreement after negotiations
in Moscow with Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Valentyn Landyk. The two
sides estimated the debt arrears at about Dollars 600m, compared with
previous Gazprom estimates of Dollars 900m. Half the debt to Gazprom for
deliveries in 1993 and the first quarter of this year will be paid in the
form of property, possibly including a stake in Ukrainian gas pipelines and
storage facilities. The two sides are due to meet again on May 10 to discuss
implementation of the deal, which lifts the threat of a cut-off in supplies
to Ukraine.
