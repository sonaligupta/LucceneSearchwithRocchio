FT  09 JAN 92 / Money Markets: Rates close steady


UK MONEY rates edged higher during the morning session yesterday but fell
back in late trading to close little changed from Tuesday's levels.
The Bank of England forecast a liquidity shortage of Pounds 1bn early in the
day, later revised up to Pounds 1.15bn. In early assistance the bank bought
Pounds 114m of band 4 bills at 10 1/8 per cent.
Later in the morning session, the bank purchased a further Pounds 304m paper
as rates moved higher as liquidity was squeezed. Assistance comprised the
purchase of band 1 bank bills and treasury bills at 10 3/8 per cent, band 3
bank bills and treasury bills at 10 7/32 per cent and band 4 bank bills at
10 1/8 per cent.
However, the heavy slug of assistance did not prevent rates from moving
higher. Overnight unsecured money was quoted at 11 1/4 -11 per cent around
midday from a closing level of 10 9/16 - 7/16 per cent on Tuesday.
During the afternoon session, the Bank of England purchased a further Pounds
193m bills in bands 1, 2 and 3. Late assistance totalled Pounds 395m,
bringing the total for the day to just over Pounds 1bn. This relieved
pressure on rates and by the close the overnight rate had fallen back to 10
3/4 - 5/8 per cent.
The March short sterling futures contract on the London International
Financial Futures Exchange closed at 89.38, up from 89.36 on Tuesday.
In Tokyo, the Bank of Japan again squeezed money market interest rates
higher, adding to a Y660bn liquidity shortage by recalling Y200bn loans to
financial institutions.
Mr Yasushi Meino, Bank of Japan governor, said the authorities were trying
to ensure 'adequate' interest rates and that pressure for lower rates was
caused by market speculation.
At one stage, overnight call money was quoted well over 6 per cent before
falling back to 5 13/32 per cent by the close, after 5 11/32 per cent on
Tuesday.
Today a liquidity shortage of around Y550bn is forecast, suggesting firm
rates.
In Frankfurt, money rates edged lower following several days of complete
stability. Call money ended at 9.40-50 per cent, from the 9.45-55 per cent
level which has prevailed so far this year.
Rates eased even though the Bundesbank withdrew a net DM2.6bn from the
market by setting a DM30.6bn repurchase pact to replace the expiring
DM33.2bn agreement.
