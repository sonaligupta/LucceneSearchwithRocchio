FT  19 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Bargain hunting helps
Nikkei recover in light trade

   TOKYO


THE Nikkei average, which fell sharply last Friday on news that Olympia &
York had filed for insolvency protection in North America, rebounded on the
more phlegmatic reaction on Wall Street, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index regained 368.83 to 18,443.10 on bargain hunting, and short-term
buying of speculative favourites, after opening at the day's low of
18,128.16 and reaching 18,458.05 in the afternoon. Volume, however, fell to
220m shares from 352m as most institutional investors remained on the
sidelines.
Mr Masami Okuma at UBS Phillips & Drew said leading investors are likely to
remain inactive during the corporate results season, which commences this
week and is expected to last until mid-June.
Advances led declines by 668 to 324, with 144 issues unchanged, while the
Topix index of all first section stocks advanced 21.92 to 1,370.74. In
London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 0.66 to 1,095.75.
Short-term trading by dealers lifted speculative stocks. Japan Metals and
Chemicals, the most active issue of the day, moved ahead Y85 to Y810 on the
'environmental theme'. The company makes metallic alloys used in batteries.
Okamoto Industries added Y80 at Y1,520 as dealers tried to revive the
'biotechnology theme'. Mitsubishi Kakoki, which makes industrial waste water
treatment equipment, rose by its daily limit of Y100 to Y1,080.
Banks, which fell sharply last week on the O & Y developments, were bought.
Industrial Bank of Japan improved Y50 to Y1,790 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Y80
to Y1,330.
Real estate issues, which lost ground last Friday on fears about real estate
lending, failed to recover. Mitsui Fudosan, the leading real estate
developer which announced its first fall in pre-tax profits in 16 years,
dipped Y20 to Y1,040. Aoki lost Y23 to Y512 on reports of its links to the
stock and bribery scandal involving Sagawa Kyubin, the parcel delivery
company.
In Osaka, the OSE average picked up 236.96 to 21,032.27 in volume of 11.8m
shares.
Roundup
INDIVIDUAL influences moved equities in the Pacific Rim region yesterday.
Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok were closed for public holidays.
AUSTRALIA climbed steadily, and then lost much of its gain when Papua New
Guinea's foreign minister called for all mining agreements in the country to
be redrawn after the June national elections.
Mining and resource issues fell but industrials helped the All Ordinaries
index end 7.8 up at 1,668.5, off a day's high of 1,674.4. The All
Industrials index was 21.4 ahead at 2,615.2.
The PNG moves threaten CRA's position as major shareholder in Bougainville
Copper, but CRA closed steady at ADollars 14.24, off a low of ADollars
14.00. Other resource companies with interests in PNG tumbled, Placer
Pacific losing 15 cents to ADollars 2.53, MIM 4 cents to ADollars 2.68 and
Renison 20 cents to ADollars 4.80.
Turnover was light at ADollars 160.3m. Foster's and SA Brewing were heavily
traded after Friday's proposal of an ADollars 6bn merger, rising 9 cents to
ADollars 1.99 and falling 6 cents to ADollars 3.01 respectively.
NEW ZEALAND reported late foreign buying orders and closed at a six-month
high, the NZSE-40 index adding 8.96 at 1,539.45. Turnover shrank from
NZDollars 34.5m to NZDollars 24.7m.
Foreign buying was again focused on the forestry sector. Fletcher Challenge
moved forward 8 cents to NZDollars 3.71.
HONG KONG took the O & Y filing as an excuse for profit-taking. The Hang
Seng index finished 67.41 down at 5,637.09 after recovering from an earlier
fall of nearly 100 points. Turnover contracted from HKDollars 3.6bn to
HKDollars 3.1bn.
Dealers noted that the index futures were trading at premiums of around 70
points to the cash index, indicating that underlying sentiment remains
optimistic. HSBC, parent of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking and estimated to
have around USDollars 700m in loan exposure to O & Y - but not, HSBC
emphasised yesterday, specifically to the London docklands Canary Wharf
project - topped the most active list and declined 75 cents to HKDollars
43.50.
MANILA went into a downward technical correction and the composite index
fell 21.26 to 1,317.11. TAIWAN moved ahead in the last minutes on
speculation that the government plans to offer tax incentives to stock
investors. The weighted index climbed 81.56 to 4,437.63 in turnover up from
TDollars 15.18bn to TDollars 22.67bn, following a rise of 63.61 on Saturday.
BOMBAY overcame late profit-taking to end higher in volatile trading. The
BSE index rose to 3,527.21 initially before closing at 3,456.16, up 61.68.
