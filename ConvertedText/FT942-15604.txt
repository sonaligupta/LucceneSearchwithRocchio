FT  14 APR 94 / UK Company News: Further shots in Regina war


   By SIMON DAVIES


More shots were fired yesterday in the battle for control of Regina, the
USM-quoted royal jelly group. The current management has written a second
letter to shareholders urging them to vote against changes proposed by Mr
Shiraz Malik-Noor, the largest shareholder.
'Since Mr Malik-Noor took control of Regina, sales have plummeted by 60 per
cent', wrote Mr Paul Geoghegan, the chairman. 'Regina cannot afford an
expensive Knightsbridge office, it cannot afford costly mistakes like polo
sponsorship, it cannot afford any more extraordinary meetings, and in your
board's view it can no longer afford Mr Malik-Noor.'
However, the fate of Mr Geoghegan is in the balance. An EGM on April 27 will
vote on Mr Malik-Noor's reinstatement as chairman and the appointment of two
associates to the board. This would give him control.
Mr Geoghegan's second letter is another attack on Mr Malik-Noor's
performance. He also condemned Mr Malik-Noor's salary and the fact that
loans from connected companies were made to Regina at 5 per cent above base
rate.
Mr Malik-Noor is drafting his own response to shareholders.
