FT  01 NOV 93 / Britain bans Polish carrier in flights row


   By PAUL BETTS


BRITAIN yesterday suspended flights by the Polish national carrier LOT to
the UK following the breakdown of talks over flight allocations between
British Airways and LOT, writes Paul Betts.
The UK Department of Transport said LOT's permit for air services to the UK
was not being renewed because the airline had refused to honour existing
agreements between the two countries.
But Mr Boguslaw Liberadzki, the Polish transport minister, said the talks
had broken down because BA was seeking to double the number of flights
between London and Warsaw at least for a trial period.
LOT believes an increase in BA flights to Warsaw would undermine its
European and transatlantic business because passengers might switch to the
cheaper route via London to the US and Canada.
