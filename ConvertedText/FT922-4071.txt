FT  08 JUN 92 / Observer: Extra time for Dunkel


Long-suffering Arthur Dunkel, director general of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, looks like breaking yet another of the deadlines he has
set in recent years - that for his own retirement.
Ambassador Lars Anell, Swedish head of the Gatt committee responsible for
finding a successor, is being told by other Gatt ambassadors that the
uncertain plight of the Uruguay Round of world trade talks makes it
impossible to pinpoint the right person.
In December, when Dunkel released his 'Final Act' - a draft Uruguay Round
agreement meant to break deadlock in negotiations that began in Punta del
Este six years ago - he announced he'd retire at the end of 1992. That was
the date by which the trade agreement was due to be implemented.
He also set a deadline of Easter for negotiators to agree in principle to
the final act's terms, hoping his scheduled resignation would force the
pace.
Alas, with Easter well past, US and EC trade negotiators are still wrangling
over dismantling farm protection. Prospects for an agreement by the year end
are dimming by the day. Ambassador Anell, supposed to start formal
discussions with Gatt signatories on the search for a successor at the
beginning of July, is being informally told he is wasting his time.
Two factors are inhibiting the search. First, there are fears that if Dunkel
retires before his final act is endorsed, the draft will die with his
departure. 'There are a number of officials who see him as the guarantor of
the draft,' said a senior member of a western Gatt mission. Second, without
successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round, it is not possible to tell
candidates what kind of institution they'd be heading.
Current betting is that Dunkel will be asked to stay on for a further six
months. But, this time at least, nobody's setting any firm deadlines.
