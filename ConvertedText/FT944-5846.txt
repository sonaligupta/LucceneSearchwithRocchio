FT  01 DEC 94 / International Company News: Tokyo broker punishes staff


   By GERARD BAKER


   TOKYO


Tokyo Securities, a medium-sized stockbroker, announced yesterday that it
had punished some of its most senior executives over a Y32bn (Dollars 324m)
extraordinary loss incurred in unauthorised trading of US Treasury bonds and
forward foreign exchange contracts.
The broker said that a managing director, Mr Yukio Sugimura, would retire
early, while one of his colleagues, Mr Masaru Fujita, would be demoted to
director. Similar punishment had been dealt to other responsible personnel,
a company spokesman said. The unnamed individual directly responsible for
the losses had already been disciplined.
In addition, all members of the board of directors are to have their pay cut
by between 5 per cent and 30 per cent for an unspecified period starting
from this month.
The company reported last month that it had suffered a special loss of
Y32bn, a sum equivalent to almost its entire annual operating revenues, and
representing more than one-third of its shareholders' equity.
The cost to the company is reflected in its forecast for the current
financial year to the end of next March. It expects to report an after-tax
loss of Y32.5bn, compared with a profit of Y7.6bn last year.
