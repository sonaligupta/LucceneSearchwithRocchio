FT  17 JAN 92 / International Company News: Adidas chief executive to quit
at end of the year


   By ANDREW FISHER


MR Rene Jaggi, who became chief executive of Adidas, the German sports shoe
and clothing equipment group, four years ago, has decided not to stay on
when his contract expires at the end of this year.
He gave personal reasons for the decision, which comes as the company -
controlled by Mr Bernard Tapie, the French financier - is earning increased
profits. Yesterday, it reported a 3 per cent rise in sales to DM3.4bn
(Dollars 2.1bn) last year.
Total brand sales, including licence revenues, were DM4.7bn; in 1990, the
figure was DM4.8bn, but the Le Coq Sportif, Arena, and Pony brands, which
accounted for DM330m, have since been sold.
Mr Hans Friderichs, the head of Adidas's supervisory board, regretted Mr
Jaggi's decision to leave. Under Mr Jaggi's direction, he said, 'the group
has been put back on track and in the last two years the company again
earned profits'.
Since Mr Tapie and Mr Jaggi both have strong personalities, it is thought
there may have been differences of opinion over the running of the company;
Mr Jaggi also wanted employees to be offered a stake in Adidas.
The company gave no profit indications, but has forecast that pre-tax income
would rise by around 50 per cent to DM60m, with a further gain in 1992.
