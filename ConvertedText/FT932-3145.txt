FT  16 JUN 93 / Matra fails to block state aid for rivals


   By REUTER


   LUXEMBOURG


MATRA, the French car and aerospace company, yesterday lost a long court
battle against a large state aid package approved by the European Commission
for a rival joint venture created by Ford and Volkswagen, Reuter reports
from Luxembourg.
The European Court rejected its appeal against Brussels' decision in
mid-1991 to allow the Portuguese government to give Ecu547m (Pounds 432m) to
the Ford/VW venture in Setubal, south of Lisbon.
The court said the Commission had done all that was required of it in
investigating the case under Community rules on state aid. About
three-quarters of the aid is money which Portugal received from the
Commission in EC development funds.
VW and Ford are teaming up to build luxury, family-oriented vans that will
rival Matra's Renault Espace model. Such vans, which can carry up to seven
people, are seen as one of the main growth markets in the motor sector.
Matra argued that a tie-up between VW and Ford was not needed for either to
penetrate the market niche and that consumers would gain nothing from an
alliance that risked damaging competition.
