FT  24 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazil expects 28% fall in
coffee crop


   By BILL HINCHBERGER


   SAO PAULO


BRAZIL'S 1992-93 coffee crop will be down 28 per cent at 18.9m bags (60 kg
each), Mr Antonio Cabrera, the agriculture minister, has forecast. The
1991-92 harvest was 27.4m bags.
The supply will fall well short of fulfilling demand for Brazilian coffee.
Last year, exports alone reached 21m bags, though that figure could fall to
18m-19m this year. Domestic consumption is expected to remain steady at
about 9m bags.
To meet demand, the government is likely to release part of its 17m-bag
reserve stock.
The minister blamed the reduction on the crop's normal two-year cycle,
exacerbated by falling productivity stemming from decreased fertiliser use
and less pest control. He also cited low rainfall between August and October
1991.
The low harvest also reflects a downward trend in the overall area dedicated
to coffee. The number of trees has dropped by 1bn since the 1988-89 season,
according to ministry figures.
Meanwhile, the Brazilian government continues to prepare its position for
negotiations on the International Coffee Agreement, scheduled to begin in
London on April 6. Officials remain reticent about revealing their probable
stance. Their job is complicated by continued divisions in the private
sector.
The National Coffee Council, a producer group, is arguing for quotas and the
Brazilian Federation of Coffee Exporters is prepared to discuss them.
But Mr Dagmar Oswaldo Cupaiolo, president of the Sao Paulo State Coffee
Processors Association, said: 'Discussing economic clauses doesn't mean
accepting quotas. . . Quotas are not in the interest of Brazil, nor in the
interest of my sector'.
