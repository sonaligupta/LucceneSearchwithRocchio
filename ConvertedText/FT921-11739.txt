FT  30 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Fox suspends more on-screen
contracts


   By DAVID BLACKWELL


TWO MORE screen-traded contracts were effectively closed yesterday by the
London Futures and Options Exchange (Fox).
Trading in the MGMI base metals index and arabica coffee futures has been
limited to liquidation orders.
The arabica contract, set up only last March in a bid to win business from
New York's successful open outcry market, never attracted much interest. In
the last three months of last year, turnover was just 10 lots.
The MGMI contract had a turnover of 7,404 lots last September. Volume
collapsed in October following the closure of the screen traded property
futures contracts, which were the centre of a financial scandal. In the last
two months of the year it was 20 lots.
Mr Phillip Thorpe, Fox chief executive, said yesterday there was not enough
interest to keep the two contracts running. They have been suspended, along
with rice and rubber, and could be revived at some future date.
