FT  22 DEC 92 / Ice-cream makers' tied trade likely to be suspended


   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor


THE European Commission is expected tomorrow to order Langnese-Iglo and
Scholler Lebensmittel, Germany's two largest ice-cream makers, to suspend
for five years arrangements which oblige many German retail outlets to sell
only the two companies' products, writes Guy de Jonquieres, Consumer
Industries Editor.
The Commission's competition directorate, which has been investigating the
arrangements for nine months, has concluded that they violate Article 85 of
the Rome Treaty, which outlaws restrictive trade practices.
The expected decision would be a victory for Mars, the US food group which
has for more than two years waged a legal campaign to open more European
distribution channels for its ice-cream bars.
It also emerged yesterday that the British Office of Fair Trading is
inquiring into the legality of arrangements whereby ice-cream manufacturers
supply freezer cabinets to retailers on condition they are not used to stock
competing products.
The OFT began its inquiry in September, following complaints from Mars and
other companies. These were directed principally against Wall's, part of the
Anglo-Dutch Unilever group, which is Europe's biggest ice-cream maker and
owner of Langnese.
The OFT has sought information from all the main suppliers of ice-cream in
Britain, but has yet to decide whether to open a formal investigation.
In March the Commission ordered Langnese and Scholler to lift until the end
of the year their exclusive outlet arrangements in Germany, pending an
inquiry.
The Commission said the arrangements would cause Mars 'serious and
irreparable damage' by excluding it from the German market.
