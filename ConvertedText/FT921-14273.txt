FT  16 JAN 92 / International Company News: Gengold falls sharply on weaker
prices

GENGOLD, the gold arm of the Gencor group, saw attributable profits drop
sharply in the December quarter as a result of a weaker gold price and
higher capital expenditure, writes Philip Gawith in Johannesburg.
Profits after tax and capital expenditure dropped by 56 per cent to R22.4m
(USDollars 8m) from R51m in the September quarter. The December figure is in
line with profits earned in the March and June quarters. Mr Gary Maude,
managing director, said the figures disguised positive trends which augured
well for the rest of the year.
The main cause of the lower profits was an R18m increase in capital
expenditure to R52.3m compared with the previous quarter. Future capital
expenditure will be lower.
Profits were hit by the lower average gold price received by the 11 mines in
the group. At R32,578 per kg, it was 2.4 per cent lower than the R33,385
price of the previous quarter. Total gold produced during the quarter rose
by 1.6 per cent to 18,114kg, at an average grade of 5.1 grams/tonne.
