FT  12 MAR 92 / E Timor peace boat retreats to Darwin

AUSTRALIA yesterday welcomed the retreat of a Portuguese 'peace boat' which
returned to Darwin after being ordered out of Indonesian waters by a naval
patrol.
The 120 activists on board were protesting against Indonesia's treatment of
East Timor. They claimed success for their voyage which had focused the eyes
of the world on the former Portuguese colony.
Australia had feared the ship would provoke a confrontation with Indonesia.
Portugal said the naval interception was illegal, and urged international
condemnation of Indonesia.
Passengers said the ship, the Lusitania Expresso, came within two miles of
Indo-nesian territorial waters before being ordered to turn back by the
commander of a task force of three warships. It left Darwin on Monday for
Dili, capital of East Timor.
Indonesian troops killed at least 50 pro-independence demonstrators in Dili
late last year. Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975, after the departure of
Portuguese colonial officials and troops. The region was annexed by
Indonesia the following year. This has never been recognised by the United
Nations, but has been accepted by Australia, which last year signed a treaty
with Indonesia dividing oil exploration rights in the Timor Sea.
Mr John Kerin, Australia's acting foreign minister, said Indonesia had acted
'sensibly and responsibly,' and denied that the ship's voyage had
embarrassed Canberra. Mr Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister, said
he would visit Indonesia later this year on his first overseas trip since
his appointment in December.
