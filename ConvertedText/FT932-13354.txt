FT  23 APR 93 / UK Company News: Brasway acquires hose maker for up to
Pounds 2.6m


BRASWAY has purchased Winster Hose for a maximum Pounds 2.6m cash, including
repayment of external debt, following its recent withdrawal from the tube
industry through the sale of a subsidiary for Pounds 3.4m.
With the announcement Brasway said that its pre-tax profit for the year to
May 1 would only reach break even before exceptional items, including the
profit on the sale of Brasway Tube. In 1991-92 profit was Pounds 1.25m.
The effects of inconsistent demand and increasing pressure on margins had
'far outweighed' savings achieved from cost reductions, directors explained.
At mid-term the profit had plunged to Pounds 330,000 (Pounds 708,000).
The purchase is part of the strategy to develop the higher added value
Europower business. Winster makes hoses, couplings and assemblies for the
mining, agriculture and construction industries.
In the year to June 30 1992 it made an operating profit of Pounds 42,000 on
sales of nearly Pounds 11m, but a pre-tax loss of Pounds 234,000.
