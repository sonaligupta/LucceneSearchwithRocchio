FT  01 DEC 94 / Economic Watch: French jobs picture brightens


   By JOHN RIDDING

France saw its biggest monthly fall in unemployment in six years in October,
with the number declining by 17,700 to 3.33m. This follows sharp rises in
August and September, which took the unemployment rate to a record 12.7 per
cent. In October, the rate declined to 12.6 per cent. Government officials
said the rise in unemployment was now being reversed with faster than
expected economic recovery and the number of jobless could be cut by at
least 150,000 next year. Private sector economists, many of whom had
forecast a slight increase in unemployment in October, warned of the
volatility of unemployment statistics and said an expected slowdown in
economic growth since the autumn could limit improvement in the labour
market.
Spain's trade deficit in October was Pta224.7bn (Pounds 1.09bn), down from
Pta315.3bn in September and Pta244.4bn in October 1993.
Turkey's GNP shrank by 8.6 per cent in the third quarter against the same
1993 period. GNP contracted by 10.6 per cent in the second quarter after
rising 3.5 per cent in the first.
Finland's GDP rose 4.4 per cent year-on-year in September after a 4.0 per
cent rise in August.
