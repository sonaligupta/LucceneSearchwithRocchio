FT  27 JUL 92 / Working women and the rise of the house-husband


   By EDWARD BALLS


ECONOMISTS tend both to be men and to study the economic activity of men.
The employment behaviour of women has been highly unstable both over time
and across countries, so male unemployment rates are more reliable for
tracking changes in the economy at large. Yet this practice, however
justified, may be obscuring the sexual revolution that has occurred across
the developed world over the past decade.
Changes in male unemployment rates do provide a better guide to the degree
of tightness or slack in the economy at large. Female unemployment rates,
compiled by governments, usually contain little information because many
job-hunting women are not eligible for unemployment benefits and are
therefore not counted as unemployed. In Britain, the headline female
unemployment published monthly by the government tends to be three or more
percentage points lower than that compiled by the OECD from survey evidence.
Even the survey-based female unemployment rates are misleading. When
vacancies are low, women without jobs tend to work in the home rather than
spend time searching for employment. Rather than be counted as unemployed,
women are more likely to be classified as 'economically inactive',
especially in recessions.
Yet these observations merely highlight the deficiencies of unemployment
rates as measures of joblessness in developed economies. The OECD, in its
lastest Employment Outlook, has investigated the pattern of non-employment
rates - the percentage of the population without jobs - in developed
countries. It confirms that male non-employment rates have grown faster than
unemployment rates everywhere, especially among 55-64 year olds. Yet this
rising trend of male inactivity has been more than matched by increased
employment of women. The left-hand charts compares the percentage of men and
women that had jobs on average across the 1980s. It covers the 25-54 age
group only to avoid complications caused by education or early retirement.
Male employment rates are universally higher than female employment rates.
But, roughly speaking, those countries with lower male employment rates have
higher female employment rates. The US, for example, has a male
non-employment problem at least as serious as in the main European
countries. But the US also has the highest rate of female employment,
followed closely by the UK and Canada.
Women are catching up fast. Female employment rates rose in every country
between the beginning and the end of the decade, while the male employment
rate fell everywhere except in the US and Japan. Again, the rise in female
employment was relatively rapid in those countries where the male employment
rate was lower: the US, UK and Canada. Female employment also rose rapidly
in Australia.
Why, when the fall in male employment has been universal, has the rise in
female employment occurred more rapidly outside continental Europe? One
reason is that Anglo-Saxon deregulated labour markets have done better at
job creation. In these countries, demise of heavy industrial, highly paid,
'good jobs' has been more than offset by the growth of less well paid, often
part-time, employment in the service sector. The share of part-time
employment in total UK employment was 21.8 per cent in 1990, up from 16.4
per cent in 1979. The US part-time share was 16.9 per cent in 1990, compared
to 12 per cent in France and 5.7 per cent in Italy.
Women have proved to be both cheap and flexible relative to men. They take
the bulk of these part-time jobs - 87 per cent in Britain, 78 per cent in
Australia, 68 per cent in the US - and often at lower wages than men would
command. Part-time female workers are more likely to have children; and
while single women tend to earn at least 90 per cent of the hourly wage paid
to single men, married women earn much less: 69 per cent in Australia and 59
per cent in the US and UK. Wage equality between men and women remains a
distant goal; but an equal sharing of paid and household work is not so far
away.

    INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC INDICATORS: PRODUCTION AND EMPLOYMENT
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Yearly data for retail sales volume and industrial production plus all
data for the vacancy rate indicator are in index form with 1985=100.
Quarterly and monthly data for retail sales and industrial production
show the percentage change over the corresponding period in the previous
year, and are positive unless otherwise stated. The unemployment rate is
shown as a percentage of the total labour force.  Figures for the
composite leading indicator are end-period values.
