FT  21 NOV 92 / Christmas Food and Drink: Cognac at Pounds 280 a snort


   By GILES MACDONOGH


IT IS not a question of etiquette, it is simply unwise to ask how old the
cognac is: you are unlikely to get a straight answer. The simple answer is
as old as it was when it went into 'glass.' That means when it was bottled,
or when it was transferred from the cask to the demi-johns which reside in
the innermost sanctum of the cognac house known as 'Paradis'.
According to this simplification of the age issue we have only 10, 20, 30,
50 and 100 year old cognacs corresponding to the length of time they spent
in Limousin oak casks.
On the other hand there are vintages in the Charente region - good years and
bad for the sharp little white wines which are distilled to make the famous
brandy.
A small amount of cognac is sold with a vintage date. This is the 'early
landed cognac' which used to be a speciality of the British wine trade. In
Cognac most spirits are blended to create the house styles of the big names.
The resulting brandies are sold with the vaguest indications of age: VS
'very special' or three-star must be three years old; VSOP 'very special old
pale' four years old; Napoleon, five; and so on. In reality the famous firms
market far older brandies within these brackets so that the youngest brandy
in a VS will be four years old; the most junior in a VSOP, six; while an XO
might contain large amounts of brandy more than 25 years old.
The small firm of AE Dor is in the old Protestant enclave of Jarnac, a few
miles upstream from Cognac, on the Charente river. Dor is one of a very few
houses which specialises in releasing small batches of very old cognacs:
'Hors d'age' Reserves, which spent anything from 30 to 50 years in cask; and
the 'Tres vieilles grandes champagnes' which are ancient vintage spirits
released in minute quantities.
Last month I tasted a range of these cognacs at the Four Seasons restaurant
In London's Inn on the Park with the sommelier, Erik Bequemont and the
importer: David Baker of Classic Cognacs. At the cheaper end of the list
there was an honourable VSOP or 'Rare Fine Champagne' (Pounds 28.45 inc.
VAT) with an aristocratIc bouquet of apricots and incense and a rather more
concentrated Napoleon (Pounds 48.20 inc. VAT) The former is basically eight
years old, the Napoleon 15. Both receive small additions of caramel to give
them colour.
None of the other brandies contains additives. The XO is the most popular
with the restaurant trade, and Dor has dressed it up in a rather vulgar
bottle to make it appeal to the Duty Free shopper. The cognac here is 25
years old and exudes an attractive baked apple bouquet (Pounds 80.35 inc
VAT).
Only now begins the range of 'Hors d'Age' Reserves. The 30-year-old No 6
(Pounds 119.95 inc VAT) is a mite fiery with a slightly catty aroma. Baker
tells me that it is extremely popular in Germany. The 40-year-old No 7 was
much more exciting (Pounds 159.95 inc VAT) with its bouquet, length of
finish and complexity.
In a hotel or restaurant the No 7 would cost you between Pounds 12 and
Pounds 14 a shot, the 45-year-old No 8 (Pounds 233.00 inc. VAT) nearer
Pounds 18. The delicacy of this spirit belies its high (47 per cent) alcohol
content. Bequemont enjoyed the aromas of oranges and apricots, I found the
elusive bouquet of irises.
Both the Nos 9 and 10 are really vintage cognacs No. 9 (Pounds 699 inc. VAT)
was harvested in 1914 and run off 50 years later. Cognacs which spend more
than 50 years in cask are often said to go flat. This brandy, however, is
full of life. The No 10 (Pounds 1,202 inc. VAT) has more of the character
known as 'rancio' in Cognac: a nutty aroma combined with the smell of wild
mushrooms, not unlike old solera sherry. This cognac was harvested in 1922
and run off into glass in 1965.
Our final treat was one of the very old reserves: Louis Philippe, harvested
in 1840. Baker believes this was decanted into demi-johns in 1910. In more
than 70 years in cask its strength had gone down to 34 per cent by volume.
Not surprisingly, the spirit was a deep russet with a complex bouquet of
coffee, iris and orange combined with almonds and vanilla - rather like some
wonderfully special nougat. A bottle of this suitably packaged in crystal
will set you back Pounds 3,743 inc. VAT, or about Pounds 280 a snort.
