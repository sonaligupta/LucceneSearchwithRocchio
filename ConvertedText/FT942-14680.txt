Reynolds Metals, the US aluminium processor, said its first-quarter net loss
shrank to Dollars 21m, or 46 cents a share, from Dollars 33m, or 55 cents, a
year earlier.
Sales rose to Dollars 1.3bn, from Dollars 1.2bn, largely because of rising
shipments of aluminium packaging and containers.
'While our loss of Dollars 21m continues to reflect the impact of excess
world aluminium inventories and low pricing, it shows a 35 per cent
improvement over our 1993 first quarter,' said Mr Richard Holder, Reynolds'
chairman.
Aluminium shipments in the quarter fell to 345,000 tonnes, from 352,000
tonnes last time. Primary aluminium shipments dropped to 55,000 tonnes, from
70,600 tonnes last year, while fabricated products shipments rose. The
company received an average price of 61 cents a pound for primary aluminium
against last year's average 57 cents.
