FT  23 JUL 93 / M25 widening proposed: 14-lane plan for busiest stretch of
motorway near Heathrow


   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent


THE BUSIEST stretch of the M25 motorway, the London orbital which is
Britain's busiest road, will be widened to 14 lanes under a Pounds 241m
package of proposals announced yesterday.
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, predicted that there would be 'no
congestion' on the motorway near Heathrow airport 'and no diversion on to
local roads' if the plans were accepted.
The M25 has been plagued by traffic jams since it was opened in 1986, with
traffic volumes far higher than originally predicted. A quarter of its
traffic is freight.
Industrialists and road user groups welcomed the proposals, but
environmentalists attacked them, arguing that they would increase traffic
levels.
Mr Stephen Joseph, director of environmental campaign group Transport 2000,
said: 'The proposals ignore the potential for alternatives such as the
Crossrail and Thameslink 2000 rail schemes.'
Mr MacGregor said: 'Doing nothing is not an option.' He stressed that 70 per
cent of the M25 would not be widened beyond four lanes, a prediction he said
held 'for 20 to 25 years'.
Department of Transport officials said the schemes were not intended to make
the M25 'into some Los Angeles-style highway'.
Yesterday's proposals take the total cost of widening the M25 to about
Pounds 1bn, Mr MacGregor said.
That includes widening the road from three lanes to four all the way around,
part of the 1989 road white paper's plans.
The most controversial of the proposals is the construction of three-lane
'link roads' along the shoulder of the motorway between junctions 12 and 15
near Heathrow, at a cost of Pounds 144m. These would run parallel to the M25
and allow motorists to travel along the same route as the motorway without
joining it.
The transport department said 'almost all' of the 12,000 responses to its
public consultation had objected to the plans. However, vehicles crawled at
'stop-start' speed on this section for an hour a day, Mr MacGregor said, and
this would rise to two hours a day within five years.
The plans will go to a public inquiry, due to start next year.
