FT  30 JUN 93 / International Capital Markets: South Korea plans some
deregulation by 1997

SOUTH Korea will substantially ease foreign exchange controls and open the
bond market to foreign investors by 1997, the ministry of finance said
yesterday.
The country will also allow foreign institutions to become shareholders in
domestic banks during the next three or four years.
The majority of the changes, however, will not occur until 1996 or 1997 and
the programme does not promise full abolition of foreign exchange controls
nor unlimited foreign access to the bond market.
Although it will lift restrictions on speculative trading in foreign
exchange markets, for example, the government warned that it will not
tolerate 'excessive currency speculation'.
Documentation proving actual demand for routine foreign exchange
transactions will be phased out, although 'the principle of real demand will
be maintained.'
The government also promised to 'pursue' a free-floating exchange rate
system' during 1996 and 1997.
From next year, foreigners will be allowed to underwrite state and public
bonds, including housing bonds, with interest rates 'comparable' with
international rates.
International organisations, such as the World Bank and the Asian
Development Bank will be allowed to float won-denominated bonds on the
domestic market in 1995, and foreigners will then be able to buy bond-type
beneficiary certificates in an indirect opening of the bond market.
By 1997, foreigners will be allowed to acquire long-term and non-guaranteed
bonds issued by small and medium businesses.
