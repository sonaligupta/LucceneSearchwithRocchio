FT  30 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Ascot poised to return as loss is cut to
Pounds 79.6m


   By MAGGIE URRY


ASCOT HOLDINGS, the renamed Control Securities, incurred a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 79.6m in the year to March 31, down from the previous deficit of
Pounds 196.2m.
The property, brewing and leisure group finalised a financial restructuring
on June 17 and its shares, suspended since October 1991, are expected to
resume trading today.
Mr Howard Dyer, the new chairman, said the 1992-93 year had been 'traumatic'
with 'the very survival of the group in jeopardy'. With the refinancing now
in place, though, the group 'is entering a period of stability.' It aims to
sell assets to cut debt, while concentrating on its pub activities.
Mr John Kerslake, finance director, said the group was achieving disposals
in line with the business plan agreed with the banks. However, selling
properties on yields higher than current interest rates would have an
adverse impact on profits.
He said trading was difficult in the pub estate, with a price war raging,
although occupancy rates were improving at the hotels. The Belhaven brewery,
which is for sale, had increased market share. Retail properties were in
demand.
The balance sheet at the year end showed negative net worth of Pounds 50.6m.
The accounts have been qualified by the auditors on a going concern basis.
A pro-forma balance sheet, taking account of the restructuring, showed a net
deficit of Pounds 16.4m, an improvement of Pounds 34.2m, which relates to
the exchange of Pounds 89m of bonds for Pounds 66.8m of new bonds plus
convertible shares. Bank debt stood at Pounds 163.2m at the year end.
Group turnover rose from Pounds 97.9m to Pounds 120.4m but this included
asset disposals. Operating profits fell from Pounds 25.9m to Pounds 22.2m,
but associate losses were down from Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 118,000.
Exceptional costs were Pounds 71.7m (Pounds 193.4m) most of which were
revealed in the interim figures. Interest charges were Pounds 30m (Pounds
27.3m). The retained loss was Pounds 80.9m (Pounds 192.4m) with losses per
share 21.8p (51.8p).
