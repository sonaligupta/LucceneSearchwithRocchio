FT  13 APR 94 / International Company News: Japanese associate depresses
Alcan result

Alcan Aluminium of Canada posted a loss in its first quarter, in spite of
strengths in fabricated products in North America and Canada.
Weak prices and heavier losses at its Japanese associate were the main
reasons for the loss, but 'if recent increases in metal prices are
sustained, we should see gradual improvement in our results,' said Mr
Jacques Bougie, president.
Alcan's consolidated net loss for the March quarter was USDollars 25m, or 13
cents a share, against a loss of Dollars 20m, or 11 cents, a year earlier.
The 1994 period included an Dollars 11m after-tax restructuring charge,
offset by an Dollars 11m special gain. The 1993 period included Dollars 6m
restructuring charges.
Sales and other revenues rose 3 per cent to Dollars 1.8bn. Sales and
operating expenses rose slightly, while administration, research and
interest costs were lower.
More cost reductions were planned, said Mr Bougie. Several businesses not
meeting strategic priorities have been put up for sale.
Spot ingot prices have risen nearly 20 per cent this year to around 60 cents
a pound, from the late 1993 lows of about 49 cents, following international
agreement on production cutbacks.
Including processing of customer-owned metal, shipments of fabricated
products were up sharply at 442,000 tonnes.
Canadian operations returned to profit, but Brazil continued difficult.
Europe showed signs of recovery with the UK, Germany and Switzerland
profitable. Pacific operations were affected by the Japanese losses.
