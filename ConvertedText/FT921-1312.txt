FT  25 MAR 92 / Management: Now for something completely different


   By PAUL TAYLOR


Employers in Britain are making growing use of secondments to help train new
recruits, broaden the experience of managers in mid-career and encourage
those retiring early or made redundant to find new skills.
The Action Resource Centre (Arc), which organises secondments from the
public and private sector into community projects, handled 425 placements in
the past year.
Examples include seconding a British Gas manager to a Tower Hamlets
community project which helps unemployed young people to set up their own
businesses, and getting a British Rail customer relations officer to teach
English to Vietnamese refugees.
Hilary Stokes, who is organising the first Careers Research and Advisory
Centre (Crac) conference on secondment in Birmingham next week, says the
increase is in part due to recession.
Sometimes secondments form part of an 'outplacement package' for employees
who are made redundant, or are used as an opportunity to provide managers in
the middle of their careers with the opportunity to try something different.
Usually, young and mid-career managers return to their employer but
occasionally they decide to stay with their host organisation.
But Stokes says the growth in secondments also reflects a greater awareness
of what personnel managers call 'resource development' - training staff,
planning careers and broadening managerial skills.
There is also an expanding interchange between industry and the education
sector. Large- and medium-sized businesses take students on for short work
experience secondments, while according to Crac, 26,500 teachers spent some
time in industry last year and about 500 business and industrial managers
were seconded to educational establishments.
