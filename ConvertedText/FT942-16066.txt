Digital Equipment will today launch an aggressive bid to take the lead in
the fast growing market for computer network 'servers,' computers that boost
the performance of networks linking desktop computers.
Digital said that its new 2100 servers, based on its Alpha Reduced
Instruction Set Computing (Risc) microprocessors, would offer higher
performance at half the price of equivalent products from Sun Microsystems
and International Business Machines and one-third the price of
Hewlett-Packard's comparable server product.
'Digital is breaking several performance and cost barriers,' said Mr William
Strecker, vice-president of engineering. 'We are bridging the worlds of
large system features and small-system advantages to put the power to manage
complex tasks within the reach of enterprise departments and small
companies.'
The Digital 2100 server is the first in a family of Alpha Risc-based
departmental servers, the company said. Prices start at Dollars 18,900 for a
single processor unit, up to Dollars 36,900 for a four processor unit.
The new servers make use of low cost personal computer technology combined
with high performance Risc microprocessors, Digital said.
The company will target commercial customers as well as those using
technical applications.
