FT  06 AUG 93 / The Bank settles on a panel


The Bank of England has named a panel of the great and the good to consider
the best way forward for its CREST project, the successor to the unfortunate
Taurus scheme.
CREST, which is an acronym for nothing at all, aims to reduce the period for
settlement of equities transactions to at most five days and smooth the way
for paperless share trading.
The Panel, to be chaired by Pen Kent, Associate Director at the Bank of
England, includes the great and the good, and perhaps more importantly,
representatives of parts of the industry with the greatest commercial
interest in the project.
Among the members are Brian Finnegan, head of settlement operations at the
London Stock Exchange - which, Kent has suggested, may have little role to
play in securities settlement post-Crest. Also on the Panel is Ralph
Walrond, chief registrar at Lloyds Bank Registrars which has the lion's
share of the UK share registration market.
Other members include Terry Pearson, senior securities adviser at Royal Bank
of Scotland Securities Services, the largest independent custodian for UK
pension funds, Alistair Reid, director of custody at Barclays Bank, Hector
Sants, vice chairman at UBS, Scott Dobbie, joint chairman of NatWest
Securities, Andrew Palmer, finance director at Legal and General life and
pensions division, Geoff Newman, vice president at one of the world's
largest global custodians, Chase Manhattan, and Mike Jones, director of
Capel-Cure Myers Capital Management and a member of the Private Client
Investment Managers and Stockbrokers Association.
