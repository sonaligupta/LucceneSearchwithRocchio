FT  06 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Euro Disney


Not all Disney rides are rewarding or exhilarating, as shareholders who
failed to jump off in recent weeks are discovering to their cost. Yesterday
they were treated to another uncomfortable bump as Euro Disney fell 5 per
cent in Paris. Walt Disney, its US parent with a 49 per cent stake, is now 7
per cent below its Wednesday close.
The latest source of concern is Thursday's half year report, which does
little to allay market fears that attendances since the grand opening have
been worse than hoped. Judging by the first seven weeks, it seems most
unlikely the company will meet its first year goal of 11m visits. Taken with
the decision to delay opening of the second phase and doubts about whether
or not there will be profits in the current year, this certainly suggests
the sceptics have a point.
That said, those who have held their nerve so far should sit it out. It is
foolish to rely too much on the extrapolation of early trends. It is also
worth remembering that consumer spending in France has been weak in April
and May. After so much Disney hype, there is no point in succumbing to
excessive Disney gloom.
