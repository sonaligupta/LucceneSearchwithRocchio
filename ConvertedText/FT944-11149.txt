FT  08 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Speed up China talks says Brittan


   By TONY WALKER

Sir Leon Brittan, the European Commissioner for External Trade Relations,
yesterday warned that negotiations on China's re-entry to the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade were in danger of 'grinding to a halt' and
called for flexibility on terms for China's accession.
'We have insisted that China should show its intention to pursue reform
within the World Trade Organisation (the successor organisation to Gatt) by
making a down-payment in the form of progress now toward open markets,' Sir
Leon said.
'But we have also accepted that not all changes can come immediately and we
have argued with our Gatt colleagues that timetabled commitments to change .
. . are a more realistic basis for progress than expecting full reform
overnight.'
Sir Leon's comments, to a meeting of the International Business Leaders'
Advisory Council, reflect growing concern that time is running out on
negotiations for China's Gatt entry if it is to become a founder-member of
the WTO at the beginning of next year.
This has prompted thoughts of deferring China's entry to the WTOuntil later
next year. Sir Leon appeared to allude to this in his Shanghai speech: 'With
flexibility on all sides, we are still confident that the negotiations for
an early Chinese entry into Gatt/WTO can succeed. But the momentum must not
be lost.'
