FT  27 SEP 94 / Council workers reject pay offer


   By DAVID GOODHART


Union officials representing 1.5m local government workers - white collar
and manual - have rejected a two-year pay offer which they say will be below
the rate of inflation in both years, David Goodhart writes. Industrial
action is not expected.
The three unions - Unison, the public service union, and the TGWU and GMB
general unions - are seeking an urgent meeting with the Labour-dominated
local authority employers.
The unions say that if no improvement can be made they will meet again to
consider further options 'including arbitration'.
