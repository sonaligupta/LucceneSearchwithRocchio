The Takeover Panel has agreed, subject to the special resolution to be
proposed at an extraordinary meeting on May 9 being passed in a poll of
independent shareholders, to waive the requirement for the Weisfelds and
their charitable trust to make a general offer for the company should they
and their trust own or control in total 30 per cent or more of the voting
share capital.
