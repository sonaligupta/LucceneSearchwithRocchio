FT  16 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Siemens boosts Dax ahead of
triple-witching


   By Our Markets Staff


Some bourses were thankful for the overnight rise in the Dow, writes Our
Markets Staff. But at the end of the European day, they seemed unwilling to
move on the prospect that Wall Street could rise for the second day in
succession.
FRANKFURT waxed on Wall Street's overnight gains and on short-covering ahead
of today's 'triple-witching' expiry of DTB options and futures contracts.
The Dax index rose 27.82 to 2,052.59 on the session, with 16 points of that
due to post-bourse gains on Thursday.
Turnover was flat at DM5bn. After hours, the Ibis-indicated Dax held its
ground, closing at 2,054.23. Mr Jens Wiecking, at Merck Finck in Dusseldorf,
said that 2,050 on the Dax was a crucial level for dealers ahead of the
derivatives expiry; and that they had achieved this by bumping up the price
of a few index heavyweights, particularly that of Siemens which ended the
afternoon with a gain of DM18.50 at DM624.50. The electrical group's results
and prospects, laid out yesterday, were in line with expectations.
Meanwhile, a better than expected report from Degussa last Tuesday earned
more rewards, the shares rising a further DM13.80 to DM447 for a three-day
gain of 5.8 per cent.
PARIS managed a slight rise in a session characterised by mixed trading. The
CAC-40 index added 1.08 to 1,931.10 in turnover of around FFr3bn.
Following strength during the early part of the day, weakness in the bond
market later reversed the trend.
Peugeot lost FFr6 to FFr747 after announcing that second half results would
be more or less in line with earnings during the first six months of the
year. Renault eased 50 centimes to FFr179.80 as it confirmed that it was to
cut 1,735 jobs, while Michelin moved FFr2.40 ahead to FFr194.20.
Euro Disney rose another 15 centimes to FFr9.75, as it built on Wednesday's
gains which came after the theme park operator said that it was to cut
admission prices.
AMSTERDAM took in another steep fall in Fokker, off a further 16 per cent as
the shares slid to a close of Fl 10.30. Not even news that it had secured an
order for the sale of three of its 70 series aircraft to an Austrian
operator could brake the downturn.
Investors have been unnerved by the announcement from the aircraft maker, in
which Dasa of Germany has a majority stake, that it would be unable to make
progress on cutting its losses this year, partly as a result of its exposure
to the weak dollar. While Fokker's costs are incurred in guilders, the
aircraft are sold in dollars.
The AEX index added 0.50 to 407.69, down from a session high of 409.221.
Unilever closed with a strong rise of Fl 2.10 to Fl 199.30, helped by a
broker's buy recommendation, while KPN remained actively traded, putting on
a further Fl 1.10 to Fl 56.70.
ZURICH held on to most of its early gains, as fears of US inflation subsided
after Wednesday's economic data. The SMI index finished 16.6 stronger at
2,598.0.
Further strength in the pharmaceutical sector led the market higher. Roche
certificates added SFr80 to SFr6,080 and Ciba, which reiterated its forecast
of a slight increase in operating profits for 1994, rose SFr6 to SFr772.
CS Holding eased SFr4 to SFr529 on selling sparked by a newspaper report
that Orange County, California planned to file a suit against its CS First
Boston subsidiary.
Swiss Re was SFr10 higher at SFr789 as investors awaited a press conference,
after the market closed, at which the insurer and CS Holding announced a
strategic alliance to develop financial derivatives on reinsurance products.
Landis & Gyr extended Wednesday's advance rising SFr35 to SFr795, in a
further response to the company's higher net profits and dividend. The share
was further supported by a Credit Suisse buy recommendation.
SMH rose SFr20 to SFr618 with the announcement that it expected a lower 1994
profit coming as little surprise.
MILAN moved ahead on bargain hunting fuelled by some foreign demand. The
Comit index rose 8.92 or 1.5 per cent to 591.83, many investors apparently
having now discounted the early departure of Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime
minister.
Bargain hunting lifted blue chips, Telecom Italia rising L169 or 4.7 per
cent to L3,762 and Fiat picking up L166 to L5,498, recouping all of
Wednesday's fall.
Credito Romagnolo added L536 to L18,347 as investors awaited news from
Cariplo on whether it would launch a bid to rival Credito Italiano's offer.
Italiano picked up L51 to L1,621.
Cartiere Burgo jumped L275 to L10,118 as it received another recommendation,
this time from Mr Nicholas Potter at Credito Italiano International. With
reduced energy costs, more modern plant and an improving paper price, Mr
Potter expected the company to hit peak margins easily in 1997 and he
forecast significant potential for the share price to rise over the next two
years.
MADRID, down for its sixth trading day in succession, traded in line with a
Kleinwort Benson prediction that short term bond market weakness could push
equities lower. The general index fell another 1.91 to 297.43.
However, Ms Clare Miles of KB was still looking for a medium term recovery,
saying that bond market stability and a recovery in consumer confidence, as
well as stronger economic growth could take the index up to 345 by the end
of next year.
HELSINKI was lifted by the forestry and engineering group, Repola, and the
telecoms-based Nokia. The Hex index closed 13.0 ahead at 1,818.6, Repola
putting on FM2.90 at FM84.90 on its plans to list its engineering
subsidiary, Rauma. Nokia rose FM6 to FM680 following overnight gains on Wall
Street.
