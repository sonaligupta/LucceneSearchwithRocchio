FT  24 NOV 92 / Inflation and money supply growth too high in Germany


   By DAVID WALLER


   FRANKFURT


INFLATION and money supply growth are still too high in Germany, Mr Johann
Gaddum, a Bundesbank council member, warned yesterday. His comments are
likely to further dampen expectations of an interest rate cut this year,
writes David Waller in Frankfurt.
Mr Gaddum said inflation, currently running at 3.7 per cent, was
unjustifiably high, especially because import prices had fallen sharply and
producer prices had remained stable. He blamed high rents, and price
increases in the service sector, in building, in administrative charges and
rentals, for what he called 'home-made inflation'.
He warned further that the outlook for inflation was bad because of the
effect of the VAT increase next January and because the level of wage
increases was out of line with productivity. He urged that in present
circumstances the government's main priority should be to save, not to try
to keep everyone happy.
Mr Gaddum warned that special factors could not explain away the fact that
M3 money supply growth, at 9.3 per cent, was way above the 3.5-5.5 per cent
target range. September's interest rates cut had not been justified by price
and monetary developments, although the upward valuation of the D-Mark would
dampen price increases and had influenced the decision. The rate cut ought
to be seen as an advance against future good behaviour.
