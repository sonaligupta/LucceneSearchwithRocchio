FT  25 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Lloyds Bank


Greatly though Lloyds Bank will miss the courteous erudition of Sir Jeremy
Morse, the succession to Mr Brian Pitman as chief executive actually matters
more. Since Mr Pitman assumed his post in 1983, Lloyds's shares have
outperformed the banking sector by nearly 90 per cent. Yesterday's
announcement about the chairmanship also brought confirmation that he is to
stay until 1995, so presumably the future is assured until then. But there
is one caveat.
Some might argue that Lloyds' dalliance with Midland meant Mr Pitman had
lost his deftness of touch. In fact a merger could just about have been
justified by the scope for cost-saving. Alternative propositions will need
an even more critical look. In the long run, shareholders would be more
grateful for surplus funds to be paid out in dividends than frittered away
on a reckless buying spree.
