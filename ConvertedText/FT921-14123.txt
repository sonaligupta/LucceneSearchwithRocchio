FT  17 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Former Belzberg flagship
broken up


   By BERNARD SIMON


   TORONTO


THE troubled financial empire controlled until last month by Canada's
Belzberg family is being dismembered, writes Bernard Simon in Toronto.
North American Life Assurance, a subsidiary of Security Life of Boston, is
to acquire First City Trust from Harrowston Corp, previously known as First
City Financial. First City Financial was the Belzbergs' flagship company
during their corporate-raiding heyday in the mid-1980s, but control was
recently ceded to a group of Swiss bondholders as part of a financial
restructuring.
North American will invest CDollars 51m (USDollars 43.9m) in a new
subsidiary, while the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation and Quebec
Deposit Insurance Board will take up CDollars 175m in senior secured
debentures. Under the deal, about CDollars 100m of First City's debt and
preferred share obligations will be eliminated.
The new North American unit will recapitalise First City, which lost
CDollars 115m in the first nine months of last year, mainly from leasing and
equities investment.
First City Trust, with assets of CDollars 3.9bn on June 30 1991, is a
mid-sized deposit-taking institution whose businesses include mortgages and
fiduciary services.
North American, with assets of CDollars 7bn, is the latest Canadian life
insurance company to expand. It already offers real estate asset management,
investment counselling and mutual fund services.
