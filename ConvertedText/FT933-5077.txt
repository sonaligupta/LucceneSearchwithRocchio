FT  06 SEP 93 / Japanese agree to further cut in cars for EC

THE EUROPEAN Commission and Japanese officials have agreed on a limit of
980,000 cars entering the EC this year from Japan, some 17.6 per cent below
last year's level.
The deal, reached in Tokyo after two days of intense talks, goes much
further than an earlier agreement to curb exports by 9.4 per cent to 1.09m
units.
Sir Leon Brittan, EC external economic affairs commissioner, said it would
'ease pressure on European manufacturers at a difficult time'.
Japan, however, won agreement that the level of Japanese car exports can be
adjusted in mid-year, not only if EC market conditions deteriorate
substantially from initial forecasts, but also if they improve.
Exports to the UK are maintained under the new agreement at 202,800 on the
grounds that market conditions are improving there. Exports to France are to
fall to 69,000 from an initially agreed 77,300, while those to Italy drop to
38,800 from 42,900, Spain to 29,300 from 34,200 and Portugal to 39,000 from
41,500.
Under a monitoring arrangement aimed at gradually opening up the EC market,
Japan limits its car exports to the EC to a mutually agreed level. This is
due to end in 1999.
The earlier reduction agreement reached last April was based on a Commission
forecast that the EC car market would fall 6.5 per cent this year to 13m
units. However, demand fell 18.5 per cent in the first seven months,
prompting Brussels to ask for further cuts. The latest accord is based on
mutual recognition that EC car demand will reach some 11.7m units in 1993.
The Japanese car industry, which has been under severe pressure from weak
demand in its home market and fierce competition in the US in the wake of a
higher yen, expressed a mixture of concern and resignation. 'The EC market
is very weak and there has been a feeling that a deep cut cannot be avoided.
But any cut of more than 10 per cent is going to present us with a very
difficult situation,' a representative of Mazda said.
Japanese car exports to the EC were already down 16 per cent in the first
half and fell 32 per cent in July alone.
