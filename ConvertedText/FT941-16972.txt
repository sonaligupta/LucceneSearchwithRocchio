FT  07 JAN 94 / Asian markets fall on profit-taking


   By MICHAEL MORGAN and LOUISE LUCAS


   LONDON, HONG KONG


Two of Asia's best performing stock markets plunged yesterday as a leading
Japanese bank downgraded their weightings in its model portfolio.
Hong Kong fell 6.5 per cent, its biggest single day fall since the 1987
stock market crash, after Nomura cut its weighting from 8 per cent to 7 per
cent. Kuala Lumpur shed 5 per cent, its largest ever one-day tumble, as its
weighting was cut from 2 per cent to zero.
Mr Nicholas Knight, a Nomura strategist, said the time had come to take
profits in Hong Kong after the market's very strong run.
Much of last year's 115 per cent rise came in the last quarter after Nomura
and Morgan Stanley in the US became aggressively bullish over the prospects
for the market, pulling in US and Japanese funds.
Mr James Osborn, sales director with Baring Securities in Hong Kong, said:
'Obviously there were some people running for the door. But bearing in mind
the market has gone up so much, investors can afford to sell down and still
be taking home profit, even from investments made 10 days ago.'
Mr Osborn said he thought the big sell-off came from local rather than
overseas investors. He said international institutions, especially the
Japanese, who have been relatively late entrants, were taking a longer term
view and could afford to ride out the inevitable bouts of profit-taking.
Bangkok fell 2.4 per cent and Singapore was marked 1.8 per cent lower. But
there were bright spots. Tokyo was firm as Nomura raised its weighting from
10 to 15 per cent and Manila shrugged off a downgrading from 2 per cent to
zero as the market picked up. Australia remained at a six-year high.
