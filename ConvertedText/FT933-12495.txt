halfway

BANCO Santander, the Spanish private bank, yesterday posted the biggest
first-half profit increase among the leading domestic institutions by
lifting net income 9.1 per cent to Pta47.1bn (Dollars 354.1m).
Mr Emilio Botin, the chairman, said the results were due to an expanding
customer base, increased international diversification, the stable trend in
its traditional business areas and strong results in its Treasury and
capital markets operations in Spain and abroad.
Santander raised its January-June return on assets to 1.31 per cent from
1.10 per cent in 1992, it increased its net profits by 11.8 per cent on the
preceding year, and its first-half return on assets to 25.81 per cent from
1992's 20.34 per cent.
The banking group's BIS capital adequacy ratio stands at 13.37 per cent.
Operating profit increased by 27.05 per cent to Pta72bn in spite of a 14 per
cent increase in operating costs that was due to expanded commercial
activities and to the impact of the peseta's devaluation on foreign currency
expenses.
The additional costs were offset by large earnings in the group's Treasury
and capital-market operations that lifted its ordinary income by 106.8 per
cent to Pta36.7bn.
Non-performing loans, which have been undermining the banking sector's
results in Spain, grew by 9.2 per cent in the first half of this year and
represent 3.48 per cent of the group's risk assets, up from from 3.16 per
cent.
Santander, which is a highly conservative bank, raised its provisions by
76.8 per cent to Pta37.6bn to keep its non-performing loan coverage at 100.2
per cent. Mr Botin welcomed the 'very satisfactory results' at First
Fidelity, the US bank in which Santander has a 19 per cent stake.
The group will pay a quarterly dividend of Pta62 per share on July 31.
