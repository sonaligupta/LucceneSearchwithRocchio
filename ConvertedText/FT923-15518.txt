FT  01 JUL 92 / International Company News: Future of Adidas hangs in
balance

THE FUTURE of Adidas, one of the world's leading sporting goods groups, was
unclear last night as the management waited for a response to its DM1bn
(Dollars 659m) buy-out bid for the company.
The management offer, put together by Mr Rene Jaggi, chief executive, was
due to expire at midnight last night.
However, Adidas said yesterday it had received no response from its
controlling shareholder, Bernard Tapie Finances (BTF), the holding company
that represents the interests of Mr Bernard Tapie, the controversial French
businessman and politician.
BTF, which announced on Monday that it had also received two other offers
for its 55 per cent stake in Adidas, said it was still considering the
management offer and would continue doing so 'for the next few days'.
Euro RSCG, the marketing services company formed last year by the merger
between Eurocom and RSCG, the French advertising agencies, expects to
produce profits of up to FFr220m (dollars43m) in 1992, its first year of
operation.
Eurocom made net income of FFR183m in 1991, a fall of 5.2 per cent on the
previous year. RSCG made an estimated overall loss of FFr280m during 1991.
Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemicals group, is in negotiations with Great
Lakes Chemical, one of its main US competitors, over the sale of all or part
of SFOS, a specialist subsidiary which makes addititives for lubricants.
