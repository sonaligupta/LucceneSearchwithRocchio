   JAPAN


Japan will discuss opening new air routes with the US and Russia to ease
congestion on existing US and European routes, an official of Japan's
Ministry of Transport said, Reuter reports from Tokyo. The talks will be
held in Khabarovsk, Russia, for three days from July 29.
The new US route will connect Alaska with Japan's Hokkaido Island, passing
through Russia's Kamchatka Island, and is likely to open at the end of 1992
or in early 1993. The US and Russia had agreed to open the route in June,
and this week's talks will centre on co-ordinating air traffic control
between the three countries.
There are currently five air routes connecting the US and Japan. Japan and
Russia will also discuss opening a second air route between Japan and
Europe, flying over Siberia, likely to open about the end of 1992 or early
1993.
