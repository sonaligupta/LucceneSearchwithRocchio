FT  01 NOV 93 / Kenya abolishes maize monopoly

   KHARTOUM


PRESIDENT Daniel arap Moi of Kenya at the weekend abolished the government's
maize import and marketing monopoly, a reform demanded by donors who meet
this month to hear Kenya's plea for restoration of international aid.
The liberalisation of the maize trade allows private traders to import the
staple crop and distribute it freely across the country.
The decision, resisted by the National Cereals and Produce Board, appears to
have been prompted as much by the need to placate donors as by a crop
failure this year. Mr Moi indicated that the government's foreign exchange
reserves were only enough to cover Kenya's immediate emergency food needs,
which he estimated at 200,000 tonnes. Long-term food stability would depend
on the efforts of Kenyans themselves.
US aid officials criticised Mr Moi's announcement for not including the
deregulation of price controls. Nevertheless, the deregulation of the maize
trade marks a victory for IMF and World Bank officials, who are currently in
Nairobi designing a new economic reform programme for Kenya's donors'
conference on November 22.
Previous attempts to reform the sector have been resisted by the NCPB, which
has a monopoly over maize trade.
Sudan's President Omar Hassan al-Bashir has sacked Mr Abdel-Rahim Hamdi as
finance minister, Reuter reports from Khartoum. He had been closely
associated with tough economic reforms welcomed by the IMF but unpopular
among Sudanese because of price rises.
