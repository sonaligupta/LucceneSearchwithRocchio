FT  20 MAY 92 / Split threat to S Korean party


   By JOHN BURTON and AP

MR Kim Young Sam yesterday won the presidential nomination of South Korea's
ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) but his victory was soured by the
possibility that his only challenger may launch an independent bid for the
post.
Mr Lee Jong-Chan, a popular MP from Seoul who withdrew from the nomination
race on Sunday in protest against alleged backroom dealing, indicated he was
planning to remain in the presidential race as an independent.
If Mr Lee stands, he threatens the chances of Mr Kim, a former opposition
leader who joined the ruling party in 1990.
Mr Lee could split the DLP's supporters in the presidential race, which is
expected to take place in December.
One measure of Mr Lee's popularity was that he received a third of the
nomination votes at yesterday's DLP convention.
Mr Chung Ju-yung, the founder of the Korean business group Hyundai and head
of the Unification National Party, is also threatening to attract
conservative voters from the DLP.
This would improve the chances of Mr Kim Dae-Jung, the leader of the main
opposition Democratic Party, gaining the presidency on his third try since
1971.
AP adds: Thousands of students hurling rocks and firebombs clashed with
police in Seoul and elsewhere yesterday. They said Mr Kim's nomination would
mean a continuation of what they called the military-backed government of
President Roh Tae Woo. They said Mr Roh's DLP must be disbanded to bring
genuine democracy to South Korea.
Police firing tear gas blocked 2,000 students from marching toward Mr Kim's
house.
