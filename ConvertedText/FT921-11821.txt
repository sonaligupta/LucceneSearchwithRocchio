FT  30 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Miyazawa confirms US car parts pledge


   By REUTER


   TOKYO, PARIS


THE Japanese prime minister, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, has changed his stance and
said Japan had promised after all to increase purchases of US car parts,
Reuter reports from Tokyo.
Americans and the US Congress reacted with fury after Mr Miyazawa said last
week that a Dollars 19bn (Pounds 10.4bn) figure for US car part purchases by
Japanese car makers was a target and not a firm promise.
But yesterday in parliament Mr Miyazawa said: 'The government will endeavour
to sincerely fulfil its promise to the United States.' He was replying to a
question on whether the Dollars 19bn figure was a target or a promise.
'We had each of the (Japanese) car makers come up with quite firm
calculations (regarding the volume of car parts they will import) by 1994-95
. . . so I believe that each firm will sincerely buckle down to realise (the
plan),' he said.
The pledge to raise US car part imports from the current Dollars 9bn level
was included in a US-Japan statement unveiled at the end of President George
Bush's visit to Tokyo.
US politicians, eager to denounce Mr Bush's trip as a failure, seized on Mr
Miyazawa's remark on January 21 as evidence that Japan was backing off from
alleged pledges.
Mr Jacques Calvet, the chairman of French carmaker Peugeot, said the
European Community should refuse to ease barriers to Japanese car imports
until Tokyo takes steps to lift its citizens' living standards, Reuter
reports from Paris.
'We should not indefinitely put up with Japan's economic power if it has not
shared (its wealth) with those who created it,' he told a parliamentary
commission. Mr Calvet is a steadfast critic of a Japan-EC car accord reached
last year that will remove existing EC obstacles to Japanese car imports in
the year 2000.
