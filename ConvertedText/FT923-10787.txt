FT  29 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Wage row threatens Italians' Polish deal


   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI


   WARSAW


WAGE demands by unions at the Huta Warszawa steel mill threaten to delay a
planned joint venture with Lucchini, the Italian steelmaker, in what
promises to be the biggest foreign investment to date in Poland's steel
industry.
A preliminary agreement signed last December commits Lucchini to an Ecu100m
(Pounds 70.7m) modernisation programme for the Warsaw plant. Further
contributions amounting to Ecu27m in cash, equipment and know-how will
eventually give the Italians a 51 per cent share.
But wage talks planned for today come amid continuing industrial unrest as
week-long strikes continue in the Lubin copper-mining combine and at the FSM
car factory in Tychy.
Fiat of Italy is to make an investment of around Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1bn) in
FSM through a deal signed with the Polish government. The factory should be
in the Italian company's hands by the autumn.
Meanwhile, the strikers are demanding that in time their wages should amount
to one-tenth of the revenues from sales of the Cinquecento car produced
there or a proportion similar to that earned by Fiat workers elsewhere.
At Huta Warszawa, the unions want a 100 per cent wage rise for the 4,700
workers earning an average 2.7m zloty (Pounds 103) a month. Management is
offering only 10 per cent. Built in the 1950s, it is Poland's only quality
steel producer. Output capacity is 700,000 tonnes a year, but sales last
year amounted to 230,000 tonnes. Lucchini aims to raise output to 600,000
tonnes.
The accord should result in a partial debt-for-equity swap with Polish banks
taking a 7.8 per cent share in the new company. At the moment the
steelwork's net debt amounts to 500bn zloty.
