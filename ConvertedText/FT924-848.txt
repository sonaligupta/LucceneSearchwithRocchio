FT  22 DEC 92 / Clinton adds two more to cabinet


   By GEORGE GRAHAM


   WASHINGTON


US PRESIDENT-ELECT Bill Clinton yesterday added two more members to his
cabinet with the nomination of Mr Richard Riley to be secretary of education
and Ms Hazel O'Leary, energy secretary.
Mr Riley is a former governor of South Carolina who worked with Mr Clinton
on a number of education initiatives and has been in charge of the personnel
selection process for the president-elect's transition team.
Mr Clinton said Mr Riley was 'a nationally recognised leader in education'
whose reforms in South Carolina had been the first in the nation to provide
clear ways of measuring progress in meeting educational goals.
The Education Department is one of the least effective branches of the
federal government, because education in the US is overwhelmingly controlled
and funded at local level, but Mr Clinton said the department could set
benchmarks for national education.
Ms O'Leary, an executive vice-president of Northern States Power, a utility
company based in Minnesota, was a relatively surprising choice for the
Energy Department, which had been expected to go to former Senator Tim
Wirth.
But Mr Clinton said Ms O'Leary had the best mix of experience in the Energy
Department under President Jimmy Carter and in the private sector.
Ms O'Leary said she felt as though she had been in training for the job for
about 20 years, creating regulations in government and experiencing them in
the private sector.
'I know about command and control regulations and I know they don't work,'
she said.
Mr Clinton is lagging on his self-imposed schedule for completing his
cabinet by Christmas. Besides the State Department, expected to be headed by
Mr Warren Christopher, and Defence, where Congressman Les Aspin is favoured,
he has yet to name an attorney-general or interior, transportation and
agriculture secretaries.
