FT  22 JUL 94 / NHS funds 5% of private admissions


   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent


Health authorities and GP fundholders have made little use of their freedom
under the government's health reforms to send patients to independent
hospitals, a study of the private sector shows today.
The annual Laing's Review of Private Healthcare shows that in 1992-93 only
4.9 per cent of private hospital admissions were funded by the National
Health Service.
By contrast, some independent providers are facing growing competition from
private wings of NHS hospitals. The review shows that the NHS share of the
private market grew from 11.2 per cent in 1988 to 13.4 per cent in 1993.
More than 70 per cent of private treatment is funded by medical insurance.
In December 1993 6.68m people were covered by insurance - about the same
number as in 1990 - but the review expects growth to resume as recession
ends.
The value of medical insurance premiums reached an estimated Pounds 1.56bn
last year, with payments by insurers to private healthcare providers around
Pounds 1.25bn. The British Medical Association yesterday urged the
government to reconsider proposals to introduce local pay bargaining for
medical staff.
