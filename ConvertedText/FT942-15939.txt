FT  13 APR 94 / Official responsible for BT sell-off calls for break-up


   By ANDREW ADONIS


A break-up of British Telecommunications and radical reform of the structure
of telecommunications regulation is needed to improve telecoms services in
the UK, says a former senior government official responsible for the
privatisation of BT in 1984.
Mr Ian Ellison, who as a Department of Trade and Industry civil servant was
responsible for the passage of the 1984 Telecommunications Act which
privatised BT, said prices remained too high and competition too weak.
At an FT-sponsored conference, he said: 'Telecoms charges here are
significantly higher than in France, Benelux and Scandinavia. Competition,
privatisation and price controls have not driven down prices to the same
extent as in other non-privatised jurisdictions.'
Mr Ellison, now an independent consultant, said the 1984 act had been
necessary to get privatisation under way, but should have been overhauled
when the duopoly between BT and Mercury Communications was abolished in
1991.
Mr Bruce Bond, director of BT's national business communications division,
told the conference that competition had played a vital role in improving
BT's performance.
'In areas where people choose to compete with us, they do quite well,' he
said, noting that BT now carried a minority of traffic from the City of
London.
