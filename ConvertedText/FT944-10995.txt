HKDollars 4.2bn

China Light and Power, the monopoly supplier of electricity to Kowloon and
the New Territories of Hong Kong, yesterday reported an 18.4 per cent rise
in net profits to HKDollars 4.2bn (Dollars 543m) for theyear to September 30
from HKDollars 3.5bn the previous year, broadly in line with market
expectations.
However, operating profit slumped 24 per cent to HKDollars 3.1bn from
HKDollars 4.1bn. The group saw HKDollars 586m from non-mainstream
operations, of which at least HKDollars 186m accrued from property sales.
Taken on a per share basis, earnings rose at the same rate to HKDollars 2.11
from HKDollars 1.78. The directors are recommending a dividend payment of 37
cents, up from 35 cents in the previous year.
Turnover rose 4.5 per cent to HKDollars 15.4bn. Sales to Hong Kong have been
hit by the relocation of manufacturing companies across the border in China.
The manufacturing sector accounted for 20 per cent of CLP's revenues in
1993, down from around 35 per cent in the 1980s, and analysts expect the
contribution to diminish further.
Next year, in the absence of unforeseen circumstances, CLP plans to pay out
three interim dividends of 30 cents a share each, with the final pay-out
depending on the year's results.
