FT  06 AUG 93 / Nigerian committee agrees on civilian-led government


   By PAUL ADAMS


   ABUJA


CIVILIANS will 'dominate' an interim Nigerian government under a proposal
agreed in Abuja yesterday designed to break the country's political
deadlock.
A joint committee of leaders of Nigeria's two political parties and members
of the military government ended their two-day meeting with a recommendation
that President Ibrahim Babangida hand over to a civilian-led interim
government on August 27.
'It is. . . envisaged that a majority of civilians over military personnel
will dominate the interim national government, including its highest ruling
body,' Vice-President Augustus Aikhomu, head of the committee, said in
handing over its report to General Babangida.
The recommendation is not binding, however, and the precise role of Gen
Babangida in such a government remains unclear. Although many Nigerians are
sceptical about his willingness to step down, he may be under pressure from
within the military.
Although there is considerable popular support for Chief Mashood Abiola, who
continues to demand that his June 12 presidential election victory be
recognised, many of the politicians attending the Abuja meeting feel they
may have to accept the proposed interim civilian government.
Mr Abiola, who has denounced the proposed interim government, met Baroness
Chalker, Britain's overseas development minister, in London yesterday. The
minister restated Britain's call for President Babangida to keep his
commitment to hand over power on August 27.
Mr Abiola later left London for the US, saying his talks there would include
members of the administration.
