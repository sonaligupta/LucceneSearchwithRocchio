FT  22 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Road pricing would benefit UK economy


   From Mr ANDREW TYLECOTE


Sir, Charles Batchelor ('Dying romance of the open road', October 19) is too
gloomy about the obstacles to a sea-change in transport policy.
Electronic road pricing will not damage the economy at all - on the
contrary. The revenue raised will allow existing taxes to be lowered by the
same amount; in fact, they could be lowered more, if one chose, given the
National Health Service savings from less pollution and accidents. And
business (like individuals) will benefit greatly from the reduction in
congestion - high-technology industry is more concerned with speed and
reliability than with direct cost of transport.
Country-dwellers will not be disadvantaged if, as is sensible, road pricing
(and tight pollution control) is introduced first in urban areas - where the
charges would always be higher.
Traffic-blighted communities can have their bypasses without serious damage
to the countryside as long as they are narrow and discreet. At present that
would be pointless, because drivers would scorn such an alternative; but if
the charge for going through were high enough, they would go round.
Road pricing is a win-win option; what is the government waiting for?
