FT  13 NOV 93 / International Company News: Philip Morris upgraded after
increasing its cigarette prices


   By FRANK MCGURTY


   NEW YORK


SHARES in Philip Morris rose sharply yesterday after the US tobacco, beer
and food group said it would raise wholesale cigarette prices by 4 cents a
pack, matching an increase announced by RJR Reynolds earlier this week.
In anticipation of the Philip Morris announcement, three Wall Street
securities houses - Goldman Sachs, Salomon Brothers and Bear Stearns -
upgraded their ratings on the stock and increased their earnings estimates
for the company, which markets Marlboro, the world's best-selling cigarette
brand.
Afterwards the share price, which had climbed a day earlier on expectations
that the company would follow RJR's lead, rose Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 58
3/4 in morning trading on Wall Street.
The move signals the cessation of a cigarette price war which began in April
when Philip Morris announced that it was cutting the prices of its premium
brands by 40 cents a pack as part of a plan to stem the surging popularity
of discount cigarettes.
The strategy appears to have succeeded in shoring up the Marlboro's market
share, which currently stands at about 25 per cent, against a low of 21.5
per cent before the price cut.
However, the pricing decision, which was soon followed by other cigarette
manufacturers, has led to squeeze on earnings.
Last month, Philip Morris posted a 24.8 per cent decline in third-quarter
net income to Dollars 971m and said it expected its difficulties to continue
in the fourth quarter.
In upgrading his rating for Philip Morris, Mr Marc Cohen of Goldman Sachs
said his estimate of 1993 earnings was unchanged at Dollars 4.65 a share,
against Dollars 5.65 last year.
However, he raised his 1994 profits estimate by 15 cents to Dollars 5.20.
At Salomon, Ms Diana Temple lifted her 1994 estimate to Dollars 5.25, from
Dollars 5.05.
