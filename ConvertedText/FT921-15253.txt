FT  11 JAN 92 / International Company News: BHF buys Czech bank stake


   By DAVID WALLER


   FRANKFURT


BERLIN Handels-und Frankfurter Bank, the Frankfurt-based merchant bank, is
spending Kcs1.4bn (Dollars 50m) to buy a 40 per cent stake in Zivnovstenska
Bank, Czechoslovakia's oldest bank.
This is the first time a Czech bank has been privatised with the help of
foreign capital. A further 12 per cent stake is being sold to International
Finance Corporation, a subsidiary of the Washington-based World Bank and the
remaining 48 per cent of the shares in the bank will be offered to the
general public, probably by early summer.
Zivnovstenska, founded in 1868, has two branches outside Prague - one in the
Czech city of Brunn and another in London. The bank has 450 employees and at
the end of last year its balance sheet total amounted to Kcs18bn.
BHF - already active in Czechslovakia as an adviser on privatisations and
provider of project finance - said with its help Zivnovstenska would be able
to develop a full range of merchant banking services, including trade
finance and operations in Czechoslovakia's as yet undeveloped securities and
money markets.
BHF said the investment was a sign of its confidence in the development of
the Czech economy.
