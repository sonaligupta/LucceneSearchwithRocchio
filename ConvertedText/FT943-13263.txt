FT  20 JUL 94 / International Company News: PepsiCo gains despite warning


   By RICHARD TOMKINS


PepsiCo, the US soft drink and fast food company that last month warned of
flat profits in its second quarter, yesterday reported a 5 per cent rise in
net income for the term to Dollars 446.5m
However, further indications of its difficulties came with the announcement
of another top management change. Just one week after the departure of Mr
Jeff Campbell, senior vice-president for brand development, PepsiCo said Mr
John Cranor, chief executive of its KFC fast food business, had resigned.
Mr David Novak, a Pepsi-Cola North America executive, will become chief
executive of KFC-USA, and Mr Larry Zwain will remain chief executive of KFC
International. Both will report directly to Mr Wayne Calloway, PepsiCo
chairman and chief executive.
Yesterday, PepsiCo confirmed that 11 per cent growth in revenues from
domestic beverages had been partly offset by higher discounts to retailers,
producing a 5 per cent increase in operating profits to Dollars 270.9m.
Internationally, operating profits from beverages fell by 23 per cent to
Dollars 64.1m, mainly because last year's figure included a one-off Dollars
11.9m credit.
