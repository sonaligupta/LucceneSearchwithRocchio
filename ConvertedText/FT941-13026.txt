FT  27 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Small companies lead growth


   By PEGGY HOLLINGER


Small companies returned to the buy list with a vengeance last year,
significantly outperforming the FT-SE-A All-Share Index for the first time
in four years, to record their highest gains since 1977.
They gave a total return of 44 per cent in 1993, almost 16 per cent higher
than that achieved on the All-Share last year, according to the Hoare Govett
Smaller Companies Index. The HGSCI, published yesterday, covers the bottom
tenth by value of the main UK equity market - companies with capitalisations
of less than Pounds 318m.
The index showed the race was won by the very smallest companies, the bottom
1,000 by value, which ended the year with total returns more than 60 per
cent higher.
Property companies led the field, rising 85 per cent after a 22 per cent
decline in 1992.
The attraction for smaller companies appears to have been fuelled by
interest in investment trusts. Versions of the index excluding investment
trusts underperformed by more than two percentage points.
Fewer companies went into receivership with just 17 companies becoming
valueless against 43 last time. Some 313 more than doubled their value
during the year.
