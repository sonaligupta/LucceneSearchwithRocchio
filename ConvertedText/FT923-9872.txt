FT  03 AUG 92 / Olympic News In Brief: CIS condemns weightlifter


The CIS team condemned weightlifter Ibragim Samadov for storming out of an
Olympic awards ceremony but said sports chiefs had acted hastily in
stripping him of his bronze medal and banning him for life.
Officials, who had earlier backed Samadov's claim that he left the rostrum
feeling ill, said there was no doubt he had behaved badly in Friday's
controversial incident.
'We all regret and are saddened by this case. We condemn such things. You
have to keep yourself in check,' said a spokesman for the team of former
Soviet republics.
