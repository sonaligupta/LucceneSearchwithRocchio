FT  06 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Repair costs and legal fees leave Tottenham
at Pounds 3.36m


   By PETER PEARSE


TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR, the north London football club currently at the centre of
a Football Association probe into player transfer dealings, revealed an
advance in pre-tax profits for the year to May 31 restrained by already
publicised provisions.
A final dividend of 2p has been proposed, which along with the special 3p
interim paid in November 1992, makes a total of 5p for the year (nil). The
shares fell 2p to 106p.
The taxable result emerged at Pounds 3.36m (Pounds 3.06m, restated from
Pounds 2.96m for FRS 3), having been reduced by Pounds 600,000 for the
unexpected repairs needed for the East Stand where rotten wood was replaced
with steel, and Pounds 550,000 in legal fees incurred in the dispute between
Mr Alan Sugar, chairman, and Mr Terry Venables, erstwhile chief executive
and team manager, in their acrimonious summer struggle for control of the
club.
In his statement Mr Sugar said that general trading conditions in the second
half had been good, but that profit in the period had been eaten up by the
above-mentioned 'unforeseen expenditure'. He added that full provision had
been made, but that the company intended 'to pursue most vigorously the
recovery of these costs'.
The merchandising division - now reorganised with the help of a consultant -
lost money but is expected to return to the black in the current year. Mr
Claude Rittner, from Amstrad, was yesterday appointed managing director of
Tottenham Hotspur; with no responsibility for the footballing department, he
will run the merchandising side, along with 'all the commercial and
logistical aspects of the company'.
While turnover from continuing operations grew to Pounds 25.3m (Pounds
19.3m), player and match expenses jumped 86 per cent to Pounds 13.9m (Pounds
7.44m).
Although operating profits were down at Pounds 3.16m (Pounds 3.84m), there
was Pounds 203,000 of interest receivable (Pounds 1.18m payable). After tax
of Pounds 305,000 (Pounds 100,000) earnings fell to 19.1p (23.4p) per share.
