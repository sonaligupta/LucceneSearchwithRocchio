FT  25 MAR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar fails to sustain gains


   By PETER MARTIN


THERE was an early rise in the dollar against the D-Mark yesterday, as the
market reacted to gloomy predictions from former Soviet president Mikhail
Gorbachev and news of a radiation leak at a Russian nuclear plant. The US
currency opened in European trading at DM1.6720, compared with a DM1.6712
close in Asian trading and the DM1.6667 at which New York finished.
Mr Mark Austin of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking's London office said: 'Any
bad news from the Commonwealth of Independent States (the former Soviet
Union) tends to support the dollar and undermine the D-Mark.'
The rally did not last, however. One US bank trader told the Reuter news
agency: 'The dollar gain was mostly down to interbank players trying to
relieve the boredom, and the real long-term customers showed absolutely no
interest.' By mid-morning the dollar had eased to DM1.6667.
As Mr Neil MacKinnon of Yamaichi Securities in London pointed out, the
dollar had again failed to break through the important DM1.6720 resistance
level. For it to make the breakthrough, he said, 'the market really needs
firm evidence that the beginnings of a US recovery, signalled in a number of
indicators, are sustainable'. Once that happens, he says, 'we could see a
test of DM1.7400 within three months'.
The US unit ended European trading at DM1.6670, mildly below Monday's
European close of DM1.6700. In New York the dollar eased further to finish
at DM1.6637.
Against the yen, the dollar retained its gains slightly better. It finished
in Europe at Y133.70, down marginally from the Y133.80 at which it ended
Tokyo trading and unchanged from the Y133.70 of Monday's close to European
trading.
Sterling continued to display some evidence of strength against the D-Mark,
but remained stuck firmly at the bottom of the ERM. It opened the day at
DM2.8675, and at one point touched DM2.8683.
Later, however, as rumours about forthcoming opinion polls suggested bad
news for the Conservative party, the pound lost its gains and ended at
DM2.8625, compared with Monday's DM2.8650.
Against the dollar, sterling stood at Dollars 1.7200, up from Monday's
Dollars 1.7150. On the Bank of England trade-weighted index, the UK currency
ended the day at 90.0, unchanged from the previous close.
Several analysts pointed out that it is common for pressure in EMS
currencies to show up not so much in the exchange rate but in short-term
interest rates. Thus, they argued, there was no necessary contradiction
between the relative firmness of sterling and the tension displayed in the
money markets about a possible Labour victory.
