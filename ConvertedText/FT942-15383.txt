FT  15 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Nigeria firm in resolve against drug
trafficking


   From ALHAJI ABUBAKAR ALHAJI


Sir, My attention has been drawn to your report, 'Nigeria accused over
drugs' (April 5), alleging official collusion in drug trafficking by some
Nigerians.
The Nigeria High Commission wishes to state emphatically that, contrary to
the erroneous impression contained in the report credited to Mr Robert
Gelbard, the US assistant secretary of state for international narcotics
affairs, the government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria has been
steadfast in its determined effort to combat drug trafficking and has put in
place adequate legal mechanisms stipulating stiff penalties with a view to
deterring usage and trafficking of drugs. Indeed, in a summary of a report
No 432 submitted to the US Congress, Nigeria was acknowledged and I quote:
'The government (Nigeria) does not as a matter of policy facilitate the
production or distribution of drugs or encourage money laundering.'
Therefore, the statement by the said US official is, to say the least, most
unfortunate since the government of Nigeria has readily co-operated with
foreign governments and, in fact, extended assistance that has led to the
apprehension and prosecution of many drug traffickers. It is, therefore,
surprising that the same US department that commended Nigeria for arresting
and turning over to American law enforcement authorities some suspected drug
traffickers wanted in the US should now, for political reasons, turn around
to make unsubstantiated allegations against the government.
It should be recalled that, when the government of Nigeria demonstrated its
abhorrence for drug trafficking by imposing capital punishment as a sanction
for such offences, it had to rescind that decision following an
international outcry.
Nevertheless, I would like to state for the benefit of any doubting Thomases
that the government of Nigeria remains open to suggestions from friendly
governments and stands ready to co-operate with all and sundry on ways and
means to combat the global drug menace.
Alhaji Abubakar Alhaji,
(Saradauna of Sokoto),
high commissioner,
