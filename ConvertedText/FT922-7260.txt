FT  19 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading


   By STEVE THOMPSON


STRONG BUYING by 'locals', independent dealers trading on their own account,
drove stock index futures higher after an uncertain start, writes Steve
Thompson.
The June contract on the FT-SE moved from an early low of 2,695 to a high
for the session of 2,730, and was responsible for pulling the underlying
cash market higher. June finished fractionally off its best at 2,729, a
premium of around 15 to fair value and some 30 points above Friday's closing
level.
The upturn in demand for the June contract came with news that German
engineering workers had agreed a pay deal, thereby averting a national
strike.
Turnover in the June FT-SE future totalled around 7,500 lots. The news from
Germany also resulted in exceptionally heavy activity taking place in the
Euro FT-SE option, where volume of 1,731 contracts included 952 calls and
779 puts.
In traded options, turnover of 19,926 lots was sharply down on recent levels
 -last Friday saw 31,994 contracts dealt. BP was the busiest stock option,
with turnover of 2,863. The July 260 calls were the most actively traded
series.
Thorn EMI also emerged as one of the keenly traded stock options, the
September 850 calls providing the lion's share of activity.
