FT  22 JUL 94 / International Company News: Strong sales growth lifts
Caterpillar to Dollars 240m


   By PATRICK HARVERSON


Caterpillar yesterday reported record second-quarter profits of Dollars
240m, or Dollars 2.36 a share, as the US heavy equipment manufacturer
benefited from economic recoveries at home and abroad, which have sharply
lifted sales of the group's products.
In the same quarter a year ago, the group earned Dollars 67m, or 66 cents a
share.
However, the strong quarterly results are overshadowed by a long-running
dispute with unions over labour practices which resulted last month in
14,000 members of the United Autoworkers Union walking out on strike.
The industrial action, which started as a series of short strikes but
escalated in the final week of June into a full-scale strike, had no impact
upon second-quarter earnings, said Caterpillar.
The group also predicted that a continuation of the strike would not harm
its earnings greatly later in the year.
Sales of the group's products in the US, which account for just over half of
Caterpillar's total sales, jumped 25 per cent between April and June to
Dollars 1.8bn, a result of both increased demand and higher prices.
Overseas sales rose 23 per cent to Dollars 1.68bn, thanks to gains in Asia,
Latin America and among former members of the Soviet Union. However, sales
to the Middle East fell during the quarter.
Caterpillar's financial products division reported a Dollars 2m decline in
pre-tax profits to Dollars 14m.
This was the result of a Dollars 4m charge the group was forced to take to
cover the introduction of mark-to-market accounting of interest rate
derivatives products purchased by Caterpillar Financial Services.
