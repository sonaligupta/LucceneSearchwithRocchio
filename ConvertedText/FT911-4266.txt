FT  20 APR 91 / Kuwait pledge on rights abuses


   By Our Foreign Staff


KUWAIT admitted yesterday that its citizens might have committed human
rights abuses against suspected collaborators after the rout of Iraq's
occupying army.
However, it said law and order had been restored and offenders would be
brought to justice.
Mr Suleiman Mutawa, the planning minister, denied in an interview with the
BBC that human rights violations were continuing unchecked.
He was responding to an Amnesty International report which said that
arbitrary killing, arrest and torture of people in Kuwait, mostly
Palestinians suspected of collaborating with Iraq, was continuing.
Asked if Palestinians could feel safe in Kuwait, Mr Mutawa said: 'Yes, I
think, and I am sure, the majority of the Palestinians will, and ought, to
feel safe and secure.'
The US responded to the Amnesty report by saying the human rights situation
in the emirate had improved drastically in recent weeks.
The State Department said: 'The situation by most accounts in Kuwait is very
much improved over what existed some weeks ago.'
It said Kuwait's crown prince, Sheikh Saad al-Sabah, had personally looked
into many allegations of human rights abuses and had overseen many changes
for the better.
Mr James Baker, secretary of state, at present in the Middle East, will
visit Kuwait next Monday. The addition of Kuwait to his itinerary was widely
interpreted as a sign of growing US anxiety at the slow pace of
reconstruction after the Gulf War.
