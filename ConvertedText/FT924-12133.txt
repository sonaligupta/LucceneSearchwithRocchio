FT  22 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: GEC hit by broker sell advice


   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO


HEAVY trading in GEC followed advice to take profits by investment bank
Kleinwort Benson. Shares in the defence and electronics group retreated 5 to
244p. More than 21m shares were traded, the second highest turnover this
year, as increasing worries over the outlook for the defence and power
engineering sectors found vent in the market.
Kleinwort's Mr James Dodd said: 'GEC has had an extraordinarily good run,
outperforming the market by 31 per cent over the past year, including 8 per
cent in the last quarter. The company is also cash rich, so it is hit by any
fall in interest rates. Its potential for growth is consequently limited.'
Mr Dodd added that there were a number of strategic uncertainties likely to
impinge on GEC in the near future. These included concern that UK defence
spending would be a prominent victim of public sector spending cuts.
In addition, a Democratic victory in the US presidential elections would hit
US defence spending. GEC would also suffer from any fallout from
rationalisation of the European Fighter Aircraft project, plus the potential
for delays to orders of gas-fired power stations in the light of recent
events.
Lloyds downgraded
Strong reports that a leading integrated securities house had chopped its
profit forecasts on Lloyds Bank caused a flurry of activity. The speculation
prompted the shares to tumble from a high of 352 and close a net 10 off at
324p with a hefty 10m shares traded, leaving the stock one of the weakest in
the Footsie 100.
Lloyds opened firmly in the morning, sharing in the general optimism within
the sector. However, during the afternoon, the market heard that SG Warburg
had taken a harsh view of the bank's prospects. Warburg was not prepared to
comment but institutional investors who had spoken to the house were saying
that it had slashed its 1992 forecast by Pounds 200m to Pounds 600m. This
would leave Warburg at the bottom of the range of estimates. The fact that
Lloyds is the quality play in the sector gave the change of view a greater
impact.
Shell switch
Shell Transport fell after one house argued that the benefits of recent
currency shifts were already in the price and investors should shift some of
their holdings into British Gas.
Hoare Govett's oil analyst, Mr Nick Antill, cut his 1993 net income forecast
for Shell to Pounds 2.85bn from Pounds 3.2bn and downgraded the stock to
'hold' from 'buy'. He said that D-Mark profits were likely to suffer in the
forthcoming year as were margins in the company's chemicals arm. The shares
fell 5 to 536p on turnover of 6.1m.
Mr Antill also argued that following the government's recent debacle over
British Coal, it might take a softer line on privatised utilities and
British Gas was looking more attractive. Gas rose 4 1/2 to 261p on turnover
of 7.6m.
The Hoare note also reviewed prospects for BP, Burmah and Calor as a result
of the deteriorating economic conditions. BP slipped 3 to 233 1/2 p on heavy
turnover of 10m shares. Burmah lifted 7 to 6741p and Calor improved 9 to
214p.
Builders strong
The property, housebuilding and materials suppliers sectors were the day's
strongest performers as investors seized on the likelihood of further
interest rate cuts as evidence that the sectors were destined for sustained
recovery. There were some spectacular gains, of which RMC stood out rising
44 to 448p, benefiting from both German and UK interest rate hopes. The
group derives 45 per cent of its business from Germany. Among other
materials groups, Meyer International gained 24 to 225p, Marley 9 to 80p,
and Redland 24 to 347p. Strong housebuilders included AMEC, 11 firmer at
75p, Barratt 9 at 73, and Wimpey 11 to 106p. Among property groups, MEPC
rose 28 to 308p, Great Portland 17 to 115p, Hammerson 25 to 226p and Land
Securities 16 to 431p.
However, analysts cautioned that the rises were probably not sustainable in
the short term. Even if interest rates were to be cut again, the lack of
confidence among potential house buyers was such that recovery would be a
long time coming. Mr Robert Donald at County NatWest said: 'House prices
have to stop falling before confidence can be restored to the sector. This
will take a lot longer than by simply cutting interest rates.' He added that
when recovery does come, with 1994 pencilled in considering the present
climate, he believed the pure housebuilders would be the ones best
positioned to benefit.
A shift in stance by UBS Phillips & Drew on the food retailing sector held
back several stocks as the house moved from overweight to neutral. It also
moved from a hold to a sell on Argyll, steady at 358p, and Kwik Save, up 3
at 705p.
BZW downgraded Tesco, trimming Pounds 10m from this year's forecast to
Pounds 570m. Disappointing sales were said to be behind the downgrade. The
shares slipped a penny to 237p. Argos leapt 16 to 258p after being
recommended by SG Warburg.
Exploration and production group Lasmo added a further 12 at 188p on heavy
turnover of 6.3m shares. Investors are optimistic ahead of an Indonesian
seminar on natural gas set for early November.
The recovery story struck a strong chord in the leisure sector where dealers
reported chunky turnover and steady gains. Forte rose 7 to 164p in heavy
volume of 9.2m. Ladbroke 11 to 160p in 8.6m and Rank Organisation 18 to 548p
in 2.9m.
The rise of SmithKline Beecham slowed following Tuesday's solid
third-quarter figures. It closed 3 up 530p. Nikko Securities believes the
rating is up with events and was advising clients to switch into Wellcome,
which lifted 14 to 993p.
Aerospace and medical technology group Smith Industries jumped 21 to 329p,
boosted by an upbeat statement from the chairman as the company reported
profits in line with market expectations and a 5.1 per cent increase in the
final dividend. However, Smith New Court remains cautious on the outlook for
the next year and trimmed its previous profits estimate for the year to
August 1993 by Pounds 5m to Pounds 100m.
Airports group BAA was volatile. The stock moved 10 ahead to 763p early in
the day as a transport conference took place at County NatWest. But a sell
recommendation on the stock from UBS Phillips & Drew sent it into retreat.
The securities house advised investors to 'top-slice' holdings due to
continued economic uncertainity. The shares closed 22 down at 731p. P&O
jumped 20 to 428p as the company presented to institutions.
Worries over Reuters Holdings prompted traders to chop their prices in early
dealings. A number of analysts have been telling clients the stock is
overvalued and a lack of buyers yesterday morning saw the share price move
back more than 30p.
There was also nervousness ahead of an international conference scheduled
for today. Reuters chief executive Mr Peter Job is expected to talk to
analysts in the UK and US and is renowned for his rather downbeat approach.
The stock closed a net 23 off at 1213p on thin trade.
Guinness stood out in a strong drinks sector, the shares retreating 2 to
527p following disappointing figures from French group LVMH, which has a 24
per cent cross-holding with the UK company.
Insurers were strong performers as their solvency margins were boosted by
the rise in the market. Royal rose 18 to 209p and Sun Alliance improved 9 to
314p.
