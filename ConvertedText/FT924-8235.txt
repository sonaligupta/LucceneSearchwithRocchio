FT  12 NOV 92 / International Company News: Gardini steps up efforts to win
SME


   By ROBERT GRAHAM


   ROME


THE publicity machine of Mr Raul Gardini, the Italian financier who divorced
from Ferruzzi-Montedison last year, has swung into top gear to gain support
for his bid to take over SME, the state-controlled foodstuffs group shortly
to be privatised.
Yesterday, Gardini associates confirmed that Gardini srl, his
Luxembourg-based holding company, was planning to raise its capital from
L500bn to L2,000bn (Dollars 1.47bn) with the eventual aim of becoming a
listed company on the Milan bourse.
The application to the Milan stock exchange authorities dates back to
October 17. The suggestion from the company yesterday was that a flotation
might involve up to 40 per cent of the company.
So far Mr Gardini has given little hint as to how he intends to raise the
money, but has merely stated its purpose is to gain control of SME. 'The
main purpose (of the capital increase) is to present a take-over bid for the
activities of SME; but the precautionary measure of raising fresh capital
could also be useful for other activities,' an aide was quoted as saying
yesterday.
Mr Gardini left Ferruzzi-Montedison in July 1991 with a L505bn pay-off,
representing his own indemnity and the value of his wife's Ferruzzi
shareholding. The money enabled him to set up Gardini srl in August 1991.
Reports suggest that Mr Gardini has a number of allies, including Nestle,
and that if successful he would hive off the bulk of SME interests,
retaining only the rice and the oils sides.
By publicly declaring his interest in SME, despite open government
hostility, Mr Gardini is also challenging his former friends and adopted
family, since control of SME would put him on a similar footing to Ferruzzi
in the Italian foodstuffs business.
First-half profits of SME this year were L41.8bn with sales of L2,961bn.
