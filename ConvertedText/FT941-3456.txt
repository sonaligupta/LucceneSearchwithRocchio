FT  16 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Heading down unhealthy path


   From Mr ALAN BEITH MP


Sir, Alison Smith's report, 'Building societies aim to shake off shackles'
(March 10), underlines the hostility of some building society executives to
any form of accountability to their members, whose capital they manage.
When I raised this issue of accountability in a speech to the Building
Societies Association a few months ago, I received an intriguing mixture of
public criticism and private support. The leading article in Mortgage
Finance Gazette asserted in reply that society boards and the Building
Societies Commission should take active steps to prevent the election as
directors of people not chosen by the current directors, and questioned
'whether mutuality meant anything more than not being required to pay
shareholders dividends'.
The government even suggests that building societies, which constantly mail
advertising material to their members, should be relieved of the burden of
notifying them by post of their voting rights at the annual general meeting.
Some people in the industry do recognise that a complete absence of
accountability, even if regulation became more effective, would be extremely
unhealthy. However, that is the way things are heading.
