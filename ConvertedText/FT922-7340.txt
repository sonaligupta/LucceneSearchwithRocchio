FT  19 MAY 92 / Crimea pulls back from drive for independence

THE presidium of the Crimean parliament yesterday caved in to Ukrainian
political pressure and backed down from its separatist bid. If parliament,
due to meet tomorrow, follows its recommendation, the prospect of a Crimean
breakaway from Ukraine could fade.
The presidium recommended that parliament annul its rather ambiguous May 5
declaration of independence following a resolution passed by the Ukrainian
parliament last week declaring the move unconstitutional.
Crimea's surprising turnaround may have been inspired by a statement by 17
of Crimea's 22 city mayors that if the Crimean government continued to
violate the Ukrainian constitution they would obey only Ukrainian laws.
Armenian fighters thrust into Azeri territory near the Turkish border
yesterday, Reuter reports. Armenian radio said its forces controlled part of
the Azeri enclave of Nakhichevan after dislodging Azeris whom it accused of
shelling Armenian villages.
Other reports said Armenians from the disputed territory of
Nagorno-Karabakh, the main focus of four years of conflict, had taken the
key Azeri town of Lachin, enabling them to establish a land corridor with
Armenia proper.
