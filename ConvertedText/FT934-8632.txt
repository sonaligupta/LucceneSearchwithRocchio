FT  15 NOV 93 / Chile's request to join Apec set to be rebuffed


   By GEORGE GRAHAM


   WASHINGTON


MEXICO and Papua New Guinea are expected to be invited to join the Asia
Pacific Economic Co-operation forum when the 15-nation group meets in
Seattle this week, but Chile's membership application is likely to be turned
down.
US officials said, however, that although the issue of allowing Chile in
would be discussed by ministers in Seattle on Wednesday and Thursday, the
Apec organisation operated by consensus.
The absence of consensus over Chile reflects doubts and divisions within
Apec over how this still evolving organisation should develop.
Founded in 1989 as an informal consultative grouping, Apec includes not only
the six Asean countries but also the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand,
South Korea, China, Hong Kong and Taiwan.
While Apec's Asian members recognise that Mexico's close economic ties to
the US - particularly if the Clinton administration wins the House of
Representatives vote on the North American Free Trade Agreement on Wednesday
 -make it a logical member, several countries are reluctant to shift the
organisation's centre of gravity further east by admitting Chile.
This in turn reflects suspicion, particularly in countries such as Malaysia,
of a hidden US agenda to use Apec as a way of strong-arming Asian countries
into opening their markets wider to US exports.
President Patricio Aylwin of Chile pressed his country's case on a recent
trip to Asia, but does not appear to have overcome this reluctance.
