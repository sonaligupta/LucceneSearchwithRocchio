FT  21 OCT 92 / Fines for oil groups in French petrol row

FRANCE'S competition council yesterday imposed a total of FFr60m (Dollars
12.6m) in fines against the oil groups Shell, Esso and Elf Aquitaine, for
setting unfair conditions on sales of lead-free petrol to supermarket
chains.
This is the latest move in a long battle for shares in the petrol market
between French supermarkets and the oil companies. The battle has centred on
lead-free petrol, which has become far the fastest growing part of a
sluggish French petrol market.
Lead-free petrol sales have steadily grown from less than a percentage point
of total French petrol use in 1988, to 35.8 per cent of the total last
month, according to the French oil industry union.
The complaint against the three companies was lodged by Edouard Leclerc, the
supermarket chain which was the first to start selling petrol in the
mid-1980s and has led a price discounting battle.
The council threw out claims by Edouard Leclerc that the oil groups were
conspiring to drive up prices on sales to supermarkets, but it did find that
they were imposing unfair conditions such as exclusive purchasing.
Esso, which has since stopped this practice, was fined FFr10m. Shell, which
last year bought the petrol stations of Casino, another supermarket, was
charged FFr20m and Elf FFr30m. The council threw out complaints that Mobil,
Total and BP had also discriminated against supermarkets.
The head of France's second biggest union was forced to resign yesterday
under fire for a lack of leadership in the midst of near-record
unemployment, Reuter reports.
Mr Jean Kaspar, leader of the Confederation Francaise Democratique du
Travail (CFDT) since 1988, will be succeeded by national officer Nicole
Notat. The CFDT claims 575,000 members spread across industry and services.
