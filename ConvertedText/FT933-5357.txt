FT  03 SEP 93 / International Company News: Rathbone Brothers advances 25%


Rathbone Brothers, the private banking and asset management group, yesterday
announced a 25 per cent expansion in interim profits.
On turnover ahead from Pounds 7.84m to Pounds 8.28m, the pre-tax line for
the six months to June 30 emerged at Pounds 2.53m (Pounds 2.02m).
Mr Oliver Stanley, chairman, said the investment management operation had
consolidated the acquisitions last year of Framlington's private client
business and three Liverpool-based independent investment managers.
Rathbone's trustee activities continued to expand, both in the UK and
abroad, Mr Stanley said.
Earnings per share edged ahead to 8.98p (8.03p); the interim dividend goes
up from 1.5p to 2p to reduce disparity.
