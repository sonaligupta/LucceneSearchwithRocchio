FT  13 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Insurance disc should also be
compulsory


   From Mr PETER BOILEAU


Sir, Further to Mr McIlroy's sensible letter suggesting replacing a tax disc
with an MOT disc (October 6/7), I would further propose adding a compulsory
insurance disc to the MOT one on the windscreen (as in France). One hears
there are about 1m drivers without insurance etc on Britain's roads,
tantamount to a licence to kill. Maybe Sir Mark Weinberg could shake up the
insurance industry (not among the best of payers) to solve this haunting
little problem.
