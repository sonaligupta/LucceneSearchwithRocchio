FT  21 NOV 92 / Finance & the Family: How to invest your savings for income
 -Philip Coggan asks financial advisers to construct a portfolio of Pounds
100,000 to produce earnings for a single person


   By PHILIP COGGAN


HOW DOES the saver invest for income, now that the rates available from
building societies have fallen?
The graph shows how the net income from Pounds 100,000 invested in a Halifax
Building Society 90-day account has fluctuated over the last 10 years. Some
years, such as 1990, have been great times to be invested in cash.
But anyone who had kept all their money in a building society account for
the past decade, drawing income as they went, would now be earning less than
they had earned in 1983, even in nominal terms. Ten years of inflation would
have done serious damage to their standard of living.
So the Weekend FT asked expert financial advisers to construct a portfolio
of Pounds 100,000, with the aim of producing income for a single person. We
outline their recommendations below. Most seem to have opted for a plan
which produces a growing income, rather than the maximum income immediately.
(We have deducted basic rate tax to give readers a rough means of comparison
but, in some cases, advisers have chosen instruments which pay income gross.
Yields given reflect those available earlier this week.)
COLE'S PORTFOLIO
John Cole, of Berry, Birch & Noble, in London, says: 'The danger with
interest rates continuing to decline is that investors are tempted to
stretch the income returns by introducing more risk. It is essential that
investors are realistic about the potential income returns and we would
prefer to take a marginally lower income to allow a little emphasis for
capital appreciation and rising income in the years ahead.'
'I am particularly keen to balance the Providence Capitol Building Society
Bond, which provides a premium deposit-based rate of return, with a solid
backbone provided through gilts and the Hill Samuel Guaranteed Income Bond.
The latter is particularly important in building up the monthly income which
is likely to be required.'
'Moving into the non-guaranteed investment areas, we do favour investment in
international bonds and providing a hedge against currency fluctuations by
way of the Hambros EMMA Managed Fund. This has a good yield and a solid
track record. Rather than invest directly into Permanent Interest Bearing
Shares (PIBS), we prefer the Exeter Balanced Fund which combines investment
in PIBS with zero coupon shares in investment trusts. It achieves a lower
overall income return but does provide the prospect of income and capital
growth. A Personal Equity Plan is an essential ingredient and we would
favour a high yielding fund.' His suggestions are:
Providence Capitol Building Society Bond. Amount Pounds 15,000. Annual
Income Pounds 876 (net).
Northern Rock TESSA. Amount Pounds 3,000. Annual income Pounds 174.
Treasury 10 per cent 2003. Amount Pounds 10,000. Annual income Pounds 680.
Treasury 2 per cent index-linked 2006. Amount Pounds 10,000. Annual income
Pounds 254.
Hill Samuel Guaranteed Income Bond. Amount Pounds 25,000. Annual income
Pounds 1,500.
Hambros EMMA Managed Fund. Amount Pounds 15,000. Annual income Pounds 693.
Exeter Balanced Fund. Amount Pounds 16,000. Annual income Pounds 739.
Murray Income Trust PEP. Amount Pounds 6,000. Annual income Pounds 318.
Total income (net of basic rate tax) Pounds 5,234.
KAUDERS' PORTFOLIO
David Kauders, Taunton-based fee-charging financial adviser, is a long-term
fan of fixed-interest investments. 'In our opinion, the dollar is cheap at
the moment and likely to rise against the pound,' he says. 'Therefore
investments based in dollars and arising in dollars will be worth more in
sterling in the future. We would therefore recommend purchasing long
maturity US Treasury bonds.
'In addition, we would purchase two gilts on the Bank of England Register.
We would suggest the Treasury 8 1/2 per cent 2007 and the 8 per cent 2009.
This will give you a further income of around Pounds 4,000 per annum gross.'
Suggestions:
US Treasury 7 1/2 per cent 2022. Amount Dollars 80,000. Annual income
Dollars 6,100 (Pounds 3,965 gross, or Pounds 2,974 after basic rate tax.)
Treasury 8 1/2 per cent 2007. Amount Pounds 23,000.
Treasury 8 per cent 2009. Amount Pounds 25,000. Combined annual income on
gilts Pounds 4,000 gross (Pounds 3,000 after basic rate tax)
Total income on this portfolio would be around Pounds 7,965 gross at present
exchange rates (Pounds 5,974 net).
HIGGINS' PORTFOLIO
James Higgins, of the London-based Chamberlain de Broe, disagrees with
Kauders on this point. 'We think gilts might be more attractive in a little
while, particularly if the government decides to wade in with a new issue.'
Higgins says of his portfolio. 'It is designed for a five year term. It is
silly for anyone to go near equities unless they are prepared to look at
five years at least. The portfolio yields just over 7 per cent net to a 40
per cent taxpayer, and slightly more to those on basic rate.'
'The deposit can be either a straightforward one or the Hambros EMMA managed
currency fund: the opportunity cost of the latter is not high in terms of
deposit interest foregone.'
The next element of Higgins' portfolio is a back-to-back 'generator' plan
involving an annuity, which provides high income (but loss of capital) and
some tax-efficient non-income providers. 'Our objective is to generate a
fixed basic income the investor can use each month' he says. 'A five year
temporary annuity provides a tax efficient income. We back this up with a
combination of national savings index-linked certificates, investment trust
zeros and a cash-backed Business Expansion Scheme.'
For the zeros, Higgins suggests the Kleinwort High Income Trust, where the
zeros are fully covered and offer a redemption yield of more than 8.5 per
cent. Although the Bank of Scotland Linen Bank BES has sold out, Higgins
thinks similar schemes will be available.
A further big chunk of the portfolio - Pounds 32,000 - would be in
investment trusts. 'The first Pounds 6,000 would be held within a PEP and
more to be transferred-in next year. Jove, River & Mercantile or River Plate
look good,' he says. He adds Pounds 3,000 in a single company PEP,
suggesting Bristol Water on a gross yield of 8.75 per cent.
Finally, Higgins includes a with-profits bond. 'I usually hate these' says
Higgins 'but Royal's bond clearly spells out the dangers of a market value
adjustment. It carries no 5 per cent initial charge but it does impose
penalties if the client pulls out early. I like the penalty  - it protects
longer term investors and makes potential investors aware that investment in
any equity product cannot be short term. Royal guarantees return of capital
after five years and a first year 9.25 per cent bonus. Suggestions:
Deposit or currency managed fund. Amount Pounds 20,000. Annual income Pounds
750 for basic rate payer, assuming 5 per cent yield.
Generator, consisting of five- year temporary annuity from Standard Life
(amount Pounds 15,000), 6th issue index-lined national savings (amount
Pounds 5,000), investment trust zeros (amount Pounds 10,000) and a
cash-backed BES. Annual income Pounds 3,440 for basic rate payer.
Investment trusts. Amount Pounds 32,000. Annual income Pounds 2,805.
Single company PEP in Bristol Water. Amount Pounds 3,000. Annual income
Pounds 262.
With-profit bond from Royal. Amount invested Pounds 5,000. Annual income
Pounds 400.
Total income (net of basic rate tax) Pounds 7,657.
SCOTT-HOPKINS' PORTFOLIO
Clive Scott-Hopkins, of Towry Law in Windsor, Berks, suggests a broad range
of investments, starting with Pounds 19,000 in Barclays Jersey-based
sterling bond fund, which invests in UK gilts and corporate bonds. Another
Pounds 10,000 would be invested in Perpetual's International Bond unit
trust.
Another unit trust which Scott-Hopkins chooses is the ExBal fund, managed by
Exeter, which invests in zeros and PIBS. ExBal has a gross yield of 6.5 per
cent, which converts into an income of Pounds 500 on his proposed investment
of Pounds 10,000. Scott-Hopkins then selects three with-profits bonds (from
the Prudential, Commercial Union and General Accident) which he says offer
yields of between 9.5 and 10.5 per cent, converting into an annual income of
Pounds 2,250.
Two equity investments follow - Pounds 6,000 in Foster & Braithwaite's PEP
(investing in splits and other investment trusts) and Pounds 10,000 in
Foreign & Colonial's Jersey-based protected equity scheme. This locks in the
bulk of the growth of the FT-SE 100 Index on a quarter-by-quarter basis.
Finally, Scott-Hopkins opts for Pounds 15,000 in the Generali Lifetime
Income Bond, which is based on war loan and pays a fixed income for life.
Suggestions
Barclays sterling bond Fund. Amount Pounds 19,000. Annual income Pounds
1,300 (after basic rate tax)
Perpetual International Bond Fund. Amount Pounds 10,000. Annual income
Pounds 500.
Prudential/Commercial Union and General Accident with profits bonds. Amount
invested Pounds 30,000. Annual income Pounds 2,250.
ExBal unit trust. Amount Pounds 10,000. Annual income Pounds 500.
Foster & Braithwaite PEP. Amount invested Pounds 6,000. Annual income Pounds
500.
Foreign & Colonial Protected Equity fund. Amount invested Pounds 10,000.
Annual income nil.
Generali Lifetime Income Bond. Amount invested Pounds 15,000. Annual income
Pounds 1,200.
Total income Pounds 6,250, net of basic rate tax, plus any gains from the
F&C fund.
NOBLE-WARREN'S PORTFOLIO
The portfolio chosen by Robert Noble-Warren, of London-based Murray Noble,
has a distinctly international flavour. His cash holding is in French franc
deposits, via one of Rothschild's offshore currency funds, yielding 9.3 per
cent.
Noble-Warren would invest a further Pounds 60,000 in European bonds, which
he says 'are very good value at present.' He feels interest rates will have
to start coming down again because the German economy is slowing and needs
stimulus. The two funds he chooses are offshore, CMI German Bond, yielding
6.4 per cent and Hambro Continental European Bond, yielding 7.5 per cent.
'We believe UK gilts are not a good buy compared to German, Swiss or French
bonds' says Noble-Warren. The exception is the index-linked sector, where
Noble-Warren suggests investing Pounds 10,000 via Guinness Flight's offshore
index-linked gilt fund, yielding 2.2 per cent.
Finally, Noble-Warren suggests an investment of Pounds 10,000 for capital
growth, choosing a combination of Latin American Investment Trust, and
Templeton Emerging Markets Investment Trust. Suggestions:
Rothschild Old Court French franc fund. Amount invested Pounds 20,000.
Annual income Pounds 1,395.
CMI German Bond Fund. Amount invested Pounds 30,000. Annual income Pounds
1,440.
Hambro EMMA Continental European Bond fund. Amount Pounds 30,000. Annual
income Pounds 1,687.50.
Guinness Flight Index-linked gilt fund. Amount Pounds 10,000. Annual income
Pounds 165.
Latin American Investment Trust. Amount Pounds 5,000. Annual income Pounds
11.25.
Templeton Emerging Markets Investment Trust. Amount Pounds 5,000. Annual
income Pounds 56.25.
Total income, after basic rate tax, Pounds 4,755.
BOYTON'S PORTFOLIO
Rather than construct a single portfolio, Richard Boyton of the Halstead,
Essex-based Boyton Financial Services suggests a series of options. The
first would be a portfolio of zero preference shares (for example, Sphere,
Gartmore American, Fleming International High Income, Ivory & Sime Optimum
Income and Drayton Blue Chip), with the investor steadily selling the zeros
and using the capital gains as tax-free income.
Option two would be traditional preference shares, issued by institutions
such as Bank of Ireland, Bank of Scotland, Nat West, Co-op Bank or
Commercial Union. Further possibilities include:
PIBS. A slightly higher risk, but yielding approximately 11 per cent gross
(8.25 per cent net).
International bond funds, such as Baring's or GT's offshore funds, yielding
around 6 and 7 per cent gross respectively (4.5-5.25 per cent net)
Income and growth unit trusts, such as Newton Income (yielding 4.78 per cent
gross, or 3.59 per cent net) and James Capel Income (yielding 5.55 per cent
gross, or 4.16 per cent net).
Income and growth investment trusts such as Investors Capital UK Blue Chip,
TR City of London, Murray International, Value and Income and TR Far East.
Gross yields on the above vary between 5.3 per cent and 6.8 per cent (3.98
per cent and 5.1 per cent net).
