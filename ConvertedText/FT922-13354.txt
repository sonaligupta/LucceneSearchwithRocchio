FT  11 APR 92 / Election 1992: Ex-MPs' pay-offs could cost Pounds 2m


   By ALISON SMITH


THE 80 MPs retiring and the more than 40 others who lost their seats could
cost the taxpayer about Pounds 2m in resettlement grants.
The grants, which are additional to the arrangements for contributory
parliamentary pensions, are at least half of the MPs' annual salary,
currently Pounds 30,854. Even if all those leaving parliament were to
qualify for the minimum only, it would cost Pounds 1.85m.
An MP becomes eligible for higher percentages on calculations based on age
and number of years at Westminster. An MP aged 55-64 who has served for 15
years or more is entitled to a full year's salary on leaving the Commons.
The taxpayer will also be paying out lesser sums for the ministers who lost
their posts, and who are entitled to three months' ministerial salary. These
include Mr Francis Maude, Mr Christopher Chope and Mrs Lynda Chalker.
More than 900 candidates failed to win the 5 per cent of the vote needed to
keep their deposits, contributing Pounds 454,000 to the exchequer. The
biggest net contributor was the Natural Law Party - its 303 candidates
averaged only a couple of hundred votes, yielding Pounds 151,500. The Greens
handed over Pounds 127,500 from 255 candidates.
