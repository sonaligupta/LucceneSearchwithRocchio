FT  20 NOV 92 / Observer: Baht that


The real name of Sia Song, the dapper 35-year-old speculator at the centre
of this week's turmoil on the Thailand stock market, is Song Watcharasriroj.
Sia is a nickname meaning 'tycoon', as he reminded everyone by publicly
producing Bt10m (Pounds 260,000) in cash for his bail.
It was twice as much as required.
