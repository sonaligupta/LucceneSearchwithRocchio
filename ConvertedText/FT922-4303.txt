FT  06 JUN 92 / S Tyrol autonomy agreed


   By ERIC FREY


   VIENNA


The Vienna parliament yesterday agreed to Italy's autonomy plan for the
South Tyrol, ending a 46-year dispute over the status of the province,
writes Eric Frey in Vienna. The Austrian government will now notify the
United Nations that the conflict has been formally ended. But Austrian
officials say Vienna still sees itself as a protection power for the
German-speaking majority in the once Austrian province and will follow
closely whether the agreement is fully implemented.
