FT  14 MAR 94 / Anti-EU feeling rises in Austria

Opponents or critics of the European Union made gains in three elections to
provincial parliaments in Austria yesterday, according to results in
Carinthia, Salzburg and Tyrol.
The far-right Freedom party (FPO), led by Mr Jorg Haider, who waged a
strongly nationalist campaign, and the Greens, who oppose EU membership,
increased their share of the vote.
The two government coalition parties which strongly favour EU membership
lost support, with the conservative People's party (OVP) losing votes in
Salzburg and Tyrol, and the Social Democratic party (SPO) vote declining in
all three provinces.
The FPO vote in Carinthia rose from its record 29 per cent in 1989 to 33.3
per cent. But this will not be enough for Mr Haider to recapture the
province's governorship which he had to give up three years ago after making
remarks praising Nazi Germany's employment policies.
Since then the province has had a conservative governor backed by the OVP
and the SPO. The Social Democrats, however, saw their vote in the province
fall from 46 per cent in 1989 to 37.4 per cent. The maverick Mr Haider has
been ambivalent about the EU.
The Greens did particularly well in Tyrol, winning 10.6 per cent of the vote
and representation in the provincial assembly.
They campaigned strongly against the government's deal with the EU on
transit lorries.
The pro-EU Liberal Forum, scored less than 4 per cent of the vote. Austria
must hold a referendum on EU membership in June.
