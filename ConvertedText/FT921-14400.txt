FT  16 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Investment firm hires
Continental Bank team


   By SIMON LONDON


BERKELEY Govett, the US fund manager best known for investment trusts under
the John Govett name, has poached a team of institutional fund-raising
specialists from Continental Bank.
Berkeley Govett has Dollars 4bn equivalent under management and is quoted in
London with a market capitalisation of around Pounds 100m. Its latest
recruits comprise the private equity group formerly with Continental Bank in
London. The team includes Mr John Hess, Mr John Lowing and Mr Ian Simpson.
The team raises capital from European institutional investors for specialist
funds. This can be for outside fund managers, such as work on Fidelity's
quoted Latin American Capital Fund.
The team also develops independent projects, such as the syndicate of
investors gathered to back property development in Berlin.
It will now be developing funds under the Berkeley and Govett names and will
continue to raise capital for outside fund managers.
The departure from Continental means further shrinkage of the London
operation of the US bank. Like many other US financial institutions faced
with difficult market conditions at home, Continental has been aggressively
'downsizing' international operations.
Offices in Hong Kong, Singapore, Taipei, Paris, Frankfurt and Brussels have
closed. While London will remain Continental's primary European base, the
number employed has fallen from 400 to a target level of 'below 200'.
