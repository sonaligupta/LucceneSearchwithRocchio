FT  11 NOV 92 / International Company News: Renault chief dismisses idea of
Volvo merger


   By REUTER


   STOCKHOLM


RENAULT has ruled out any merger with Swedish vehicle maker Volvo in the
near future, in spite of cross-shareholdings, Reuter reports from Stockholm.
'I think we have to increase co-operation within the current ownership
(structure),' Mr Louis Schweitzer, Renault chief executive, said.
He said a new French law would be needed to change the ownership structures
of both companies. Renault has a 25 per cent equity stake in Volvo Car and
45 per cent in Volvo Truck. Volvo owns 20 per cent of Renault and 45 per
cent of the French group's trucks and buses company.
