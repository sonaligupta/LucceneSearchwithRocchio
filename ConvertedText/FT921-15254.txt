FT  11 JAN 92 / International Company News: CNL in Spanish bank deal


   By PETER BRUCE


   MADRID


CORPORACION Nacional de Leasing, the Spanish investment company controlled
by the Barcelona financier, Mr Javier de la Rosa, has paid around Dollars
30m for a 10 per cent stake in one of Spain's most profitable regional
banks, the Banco de Ibiza.
The CNL purchase marks another step in Mr de la Rosa's evolution as one of
Spain's most powerful individual investors. Until recently, Mr de la Rosa
was best known as the Spanish partner of the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO).
Under his guidance, the Kuwaitis built up one of the biggest private sector
industrial and food groups in Spain.
In the past two years, however, he has begun to expand his business empire,
while retaining a key stake in KIO's Spanish operations.
He bid for, and won, 30 per cent of CNL on the stock market last year,
before selling the bank's leasing portfolio to a domestic bank. Earlier this
week he announced he intended to merge CNL with his other investment
vehicle, Tibidabo.
Banco de Ibiza owns half, along with the Instituto San Paolo de Torino of
Italy, of a Catalan bank, Banca Catala.
Banco de Ibiza reported first-half pre-tax profits of Pta801m (Dollars 8.1m)
last year.
