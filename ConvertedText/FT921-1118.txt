FT  25 MAR 92 / Money Markets: Bank calms market


THE Bank of England made its desire to calm the market clear from the outset
yesterday, supplying plentiful early liquidity. 'The Bank were very helpful
on Monday, and they were very helpful again today,' said one dealer.
The Bank's morning forecast was for a shortage of around Pounds 750m, which
it immediately sought to relieve with offers to purchase bills across all
four bands. It bought a total of Pounds 709m of bills, including Pounds 640m
of Band 1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent.
'The Bank probably didn't need to do an early round,' said one dealer.
Without an election campaign, 'they probably would have waited till
lunchtime' to offer relief.
The Bank's action resulted in a slight easing of rates: just before lunch,
three-month money was trading at 10 13/16 - 3/4 , down from Monday's 10 7/8
 -13/16 . There were no Bank operations at lunchtime, but in the afternoon,
the Bank revised its estimate of the shortage to around Pounds 800m, and
bought a further Pounds 100m of band-1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent.
Three-month money closed at 10 13/16 -, a further easing. The June sterling
contract closed at 89.05, not far from the day's high of 89.11 and up from
Monday's close of 88.97.
Overnight rates dropped as low as 7 per cent during the day, but closed at
10 3/8 - 1/8 , a level which was 'historically, almost giving money away,'
said one dealer.
'The market is not so much discounting a half-point rise after the election
as discounting the possibility of a much bigger rise if Labour forms a
minority government,' said Mark Austin of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking
Corporation. Fears that a Labour government might face a weakening pound
increased the risk of a significant rise in interest rates - so that,
allowing for the electoral probabilities, 'the market is starting to
discount half of that.'
The Bundesbank announced that German M3 money supply grew at an annualised
rate of 8.5 per cent in February after a 9.0 per cent rise in January. The
Bundesbank's 1992 M3 growth target is 3.5 to 5.5 pct.
German call money remained unchanged at 9.65-70 per cent as tax payments
continued to put upwards pressure on rates. The Bundesbank set a tender for
a 28-day securities repurchase agreement. A DM 5.5bn facility at rates of
mostly 9.45 per cent expires today.
