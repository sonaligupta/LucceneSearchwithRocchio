FT  25 MAR 92 / International Company News: Net profits up 13% at Jardine
Fleming

JARDINE Fleming, the Hong Kong merchant banking joint venture between the
colony's Jardine Matheson and Robert Fleming, the UK merchant bank,
announced a 13 per cent increase in 1991 net profits to USDollars 84m, up
from USDollars 74m in 1991. This represented a 53 per cent return on
shareholders' funds.
The fund management operations had a good year, with funds under management
increasing by 36 per cent to USDollars 10bn. However, with Japan proving the
weakest leading world stock market for the second consecutive year, the
group has shifted its emphasis towards a wider range of Asian markets.
The broking operations performed strongly. Mr Alan Smith, managing director,
said that, even in the weak Japanese market, Jardine Fleming achieved
greater broking volumes, through substantially increasing its domestic
sales.
The broking operations also benefited from the opening up of the South
Korean and Taiwanese markets to overseas investors, since it had already
established offices in Taipei and Seoul.
Jardine Fleming profited from the issue of a number of covered warrants on
blue chip Hong Kong companies, while the wholesale banking business also saw
earnings growth from its foreign exchange and options operations.
The results, which were in line with expectations, showed a substantial
increase in operating profits, since the 1990 results had been boosted by
the exceptional profit from the sale of its stockbroking interests in
Taiwan.
