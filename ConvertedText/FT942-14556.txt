FT  20 APR 94 / Surfers may launch pollution claim


Four surfers have been granted legal aid to investigate the possibility of
lodging personal injury claims against South West Water for damages over
health problems they allege were caused by polluted seawater.
The surfers plan to seek a High Court writ for damages when the
investigation is completed.
South West Water said it had not been informed of any proposed action. It
added: 'Until we do it is too early to speculate.'
