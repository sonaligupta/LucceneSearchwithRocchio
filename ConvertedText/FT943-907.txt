FT  27 SEP 94 / Observer: Classical spine


And as young, marketing-minded Hely Hutchinson was stirring up the book
trade, the industry lost one of the last remaining old guard, Colin
Haycraft, who died at the weekend at the age of 65.
He was chairman and managing director of Duckworths, one of the last
independent publishers. In 1992 he faced an attempt to oust him. Haycraft -
who paid himself Pounds 25,000 a year - simply remortgaged his house, bought
shares to regain control and kicked out those who had tried to do the same
to him.
A classical scholar, one of Haycraft's obsessions was to see the publication
of a full edition of Edward Gibbon's The Decline and Fall of The Roman
Empire; characteristically, he denounced another publisher, Everyman, for
producing a three-volume version with 11 chapters omitted.
'The blurb on the (Everyman) slipcase gives no hint that the edition is not
complete, and as the three volumes inside are shrink-wrapped, in their
special condoms, we don't realise until we get home,' was the view of one of
the last gentleman publishers.
