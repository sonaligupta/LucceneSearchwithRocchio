FT  12 NOV 92 / International Company News: Nintendo set to make top three
in profit league


   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO


NINTENDO, the Japanese video game manufacturer, is likely to replace
Matsushita, the world's largest consumer electronics company, as the third
largest profit earner among listed manufacturing companies in Japan in
fiscal year 1993.
The change in fortune stems largely from the sharp fall in Matsushita's
earnings rather than from any dramatic increase in profits from Nintendo.
Industry analysts in Japan said that in the year to March 1993 they expect
to see Nintendo emerging third in profits earned among the non-financial
companies, after Toyota, the automobile manufacturer and Nippon Telegraph
and Telephone, the telecommunications group.
The forecast rise in Nintendo's ranking came as the company prepared to
unveil interim pre-tax profits next week.
For the full year to March 1993, which will include results from the
important Christmas selling season, Nomura Research Institute forecasts
parent current profit for Nintendo of Y167bn (Dollars 1.35bn) against Y156bn
in 1991.
Matsushita, which sells internationally under the Panasonic and Technics
brand names, is forecasting parent current profit of Y102bn, down from
Y196bn a year ago.
Last month, Matsushita reported interim pre-tax profits down 51 per cent at
Y52.3bn on sales down 7 per cent to Y2,294bn.
In contrast to the sluggish demand experienced by consumer electronics
products overall, video games have been enjoying strong sales in major
markets.
Nintendo's popular games characters - Mario, in particular - have a wide
following. Mario is to be featured in a film to be released next year.
