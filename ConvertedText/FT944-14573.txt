FT  22 OCT 94 / Mayor resigns after 32 die in bridge collapse


   By JOHN BURTON


   SEOUL


The mayor of Seoul resigned yesterday after a 48-metre stretch of a motorway
bridge over the Han River collapsed during the morning rush hour, killing at
least 32 people, writes John Burton in Seoul.
City authorities were blamed for poor maintenance of the Songsu bridge
(pictured left), one of the most heavily used in Seoul.
Dong-ah Construction, Korea's third largest engineering company which built
the bridge in 1979, said the bridge may have deteriorated because traffic
use exceeded its design specifications. It said its legal responsibility to
repair any defects had lapsed in 1984. Several other bridges in Korea have
collapsed in recent years due to sub-standard work. The government may soon
allow construction supervision by foreign companies to prevent future
accidents. Authorities are expected to increase safety inspections of public
infrastructures.
