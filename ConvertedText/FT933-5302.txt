FT  03 SEP 93 / International Company News: Procordia to change name as
units split


   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES


PROCORDIA is to change its name to Pharmacia after the Swedish group splits
into separate pharmaceutical and consumer products units later this year,
writes Christopher Brown-Humes.
Mr Jan Ekberg, head of Procordia, will be Pharmacia's chief executive.
Procordia is being split following an agreement in June between its two main
owners, the Swedish government and Volvo, the car and truck maker. Volvo
will gain a 74 per cent stake in the group's consumer products operations,
and a 25 per cent holding in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology businesses
to be grouped within Pharmacia.
The government will be the majority owner in Pharmacia, although it is
likely to sell its stake next year. Pharmacia includes 51 per cent of
Erbamont, the Italian drugs company which Procordia bought from Montedison
in May.
