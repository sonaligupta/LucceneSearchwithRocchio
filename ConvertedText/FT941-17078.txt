FT  06 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Co-operation in Scott inquiry


   Mr CHRISTOPHER MUTTUKUMARU


Sir, Your story, 'Further delays for Iraq arms inquiry' (January 5) suggests
ministers are in some way responsible for delaying the work of Lord Justice
Scott's inquiry. On the contrary, all serving ministers and former ministers
have, thus far, co-operated fully.
So far as Lord Trefgarne is concerned, I have been informed by his
solicitors that he is considering with them whether to provide written
and/or oral evidence.
Christopher Muttukumaru,
secretary to the inquiry,
Inquiry into exports of defence equipment and dual use goods to Iraq,
