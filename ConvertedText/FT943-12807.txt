FT  22 JUL 94 / International Company News: Recovery continues at Northwest


   By RICHARD TOMKINS


Northwest Airlines, the fourth biggest US carrier, yesterday reported a
turnround from net losses of Dollars 136.2m last time to net profits of
Dollars 71.3m for its first full quarter since returning to the stock market
in March.
The company attributed the improvement to an 8.5 per cent increase in
revenues to Dollars 2.27bn, combined with a slight decrease in operating
expenses, down to Dollars 2.07bn from Dollars 2.08bn.
Second-quarter operating profits rose to Dollars 207.8m from Dollars 19.2m.
Fully diluted earnings per share were 67 cents, compared with losses of
Dollars 2.42 last time.
For the six months to June, the company reported a turnround to profits of
Dollars 89.6m from losses of Dollars 236.5m.
The quarter was the fourth consecutive period of profitability for Northwest
at a time when most other big US airlines have been showing losses or very
small profits. The company said this was the first time it had reported four
consecutive quarters of net profits since 1989.
It wes helped by an agreement with its labour unions under which employees
agreed to exchange Dollars 886m worth of labour concessions for a 33 per
cent stake in the company (down to 26 per cent following the initial public
offering).
Northwest has been restructuring its routes and flights in an attempt to cut
out loss-making services and increase profitable flying. The number of
available seat miles fell by 1.8 per cent to 21.39bn.
