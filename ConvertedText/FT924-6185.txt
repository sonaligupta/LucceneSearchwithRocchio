FT  23 NOV 92 / Arts: Today's Television


   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY


We can hardly complain at present about the amount of current affairs on
offer in peak viewing time. Many believe that once the new franchise
arrangements really begin to bite in 1993, ITV's current affairs (other than
tabloid-TV series) will be driven to the margins.
If that happens and Channel 4 finds life and therefore competition tougher
once it is selling its own air time, we may find ourselves limited to BBC
current affairs during normal waking hours.
Mondays bring World In Action (8.30 ITV), Cutting Edge (C4 9.00) and
Panorama (9.30 BBC1). Respectively they deal with 'The Crack Connnection',
which suggests that some police are planting evidence and dealing in drugs;
'tug of love' children; and the Matrix Churchill affair.
Drugs and abducted children are two 'banker' subjects. Any aspect of sex is
another, and today C4 starts a series called Catholics And Sex (11.00) with
a look at the celibate priesthood which hands down diktats from the Holy See
and the ordinary people who pay the price.
