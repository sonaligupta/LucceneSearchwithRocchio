assistance may be at hand. Nasa is soon to start an ambitious search for
extraterrestrial intelligence

'At this instant, through this very document, are perhaps passing radio
waves bearing the conversations of distant creatures - conversations we
could record if we but pointed a telescope in the right direction and tuned
to the proper frequency . . .'
 - Astronomy Survey Committee of the US National Academy of Sciences, 1972.
SUPPOSE YOU are staying in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, and you want to get
to Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. It is simple. You drive
south, then east, then south and then east again on to the Santa Monica
freeway.
As it is the rush hour, the traffic buzzes angrily. You peek at other
drivers. Boy, have they got problems; they're probably in therapy. But you,
you're doing fine, because you have now sort of drifted across five lanes of
traffic and have somehow turned north on to the Pasadena freeway.
As you wheel along, you fiddle with the radio 'Seek' button, flicking from
station to station, hundreds of them, seemingly, pumping out pop, rock, rap;
bulletins and news flashes; rapes and serial killings; messages from our
sponsor; dog food and vitamin pills; Tums, Skippy, Tylenol - uproar,
babeldom.
As it happens, radio and TV signals broadcast on Earth are also transmitted
into space at the speed of light. The earliest TV transmissions from Earth
have travelled more than 40 light years, or ten times further than Alpha
Centauri, our own sun's nearest neighbour. This radio, radar and TV leakage
of ours now fills a sphere more than 80 light years in diameter. (A light
year is the distance light travels in one year: about 6 trillion miles).
In addition, we have sent into space a few intentional messages, such as
that broadcast in 1974 at the rededication of the Arecibo Observatory in
Puerto Rico. The message included descriptions of our solar system, the
elements important to Earthly life and the structure of the DNA molecule. We
beamed that message in the direction of the globular star cluster M13, about
25,000 light years away.
Which is all fine and good. But what about incoming messages? Are we ready
to receive, as well as transmit? After all, our own Milky Way galaxy
contains an estimated 300bn-400bn stars. And with each passing year,
estimates of the probability of intelligent life on far-flung planets
increase. In the view of many scientists on Earth, we are within reach of
one of the key steps in our evolution - knowledge of the existence, nature
and activities of independent civilisations in space.
Are we ready for incoming calls? The answer is Yes: we are about to start
serious eavesdropping. On October 12, Columbus Day, Nasa will launch its
ten-year, Dollars 100m (Pounds 57.8m) Search for Extraterrestrial
Intelligence, or Seti programme - a systematic search of the microwave radio
spectrum for signals of intelligent origin. Seti is a joint venture between
Nasa's Ames Research Centre and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the
California Institute of Technology.
As such, it is part of one of the seven areas of Nasa research recommended
by the National Commission on Space in 1986: 'A continuing programme to
search for evidence that life exists - or has existed  - beyond Earth, by
studying other bodies of the solar system, by searching for planets circling
other stars, and by searching for signals broadcast by intelligent life
elsewhere in the galaxy.'
Naturally, the launch of Nasa's Seti programme will prove a lodestar for
jesters, cynics and two-bit comedians, the banality of whose jokes - 'I was
on my way to Venus when all of a sudden . . .' - will be as predictable as
the Flat Earth witticisms that reverberated in Columbus's ears when he set
sail for America 500 years ago.
BIOASTRONOMY - the study of life in the universe, and the search for
evidence of intelligence - is now so respectable that it is almost
strait-laced. A few generations ago, astronomers believed that planetary
systems were extremely rare; that the Earth's ability to support life was
possibly unique.
In the last two decades, however, advances in astronomy and physics have
supported the idea that planets are not rare but a natural part of the
star-formation process, and may number in the hundreds of billions in our
galaxy alone. As a result, in 1990 the US Congress voted funds for Nasa to
design and build special digital processing systems capable of searching
tens of millions of radio channels.
Is anyone out there? In the editors' foreword to the account of proceedings
at the Third International Symposium on Bioastronomy in Savoie, France, in
June 1990, the complex trail of cosmic evolution is described in five
stages:
First, the appearance of matter soon after Big Bang, leading to the
formation of stars and planets several billion years later and continuing
with the synthesis of chemical elements like carbon;
Second, formation of the first organic molecules; these molecules have been
discovered in interstellar space by radio-astronomers and in comets by space
probes;
Third, a prebiotic chemistry stage in which complex building blocks are
produced, such as nitric bases that form the rungs of the DNA double helix
ladder; some theories predict that a prebiotic chemistry could be proceeding
even now on Titan, the large moon of the planet Saturn;
Fourth, a primitive biological stage like the one of bacteria which
dominated the Earth's first few billion years; scientists hope to discover
this form of biological activity, perhaps in a different form, buried in the
permafrost of Mars;
Fifth, 'advanced' life, perhaps more advanced than ours. Nothing - so far -
indicates that Homo sapiens are unique in the universe.
To quote Nasa: 'One direct way of testing whether intelligent life exists
beyond our solar system is to search for an artificially generated radio
signal coming from interstellar space. Advanced civilisations might be
operating radio beacons, possibly to attract the attention of emerging
societies and bring them into contact with a community of long-established
intelligent societies existing throughout the galaxy.'
To detect either type of signal - beacon or leakage  - it makes great sense
to look at frequencies where background radio noise is minimal. 'One of the
quietest regions of the electromagnetic spectrum', says Nasa, 'is the
'microwave window' that lies in the frequency band between 1,000 and 10,000
megahertz (MHz). It is reasonable to assume that others wishing to establish
interstellar contact by radio might choose this band.'
SO OFF WE GO, though not for the first time. The first serious proposal for
using radio waves to transmit information over interstellar distances was
suggested by physicists Philip Morrison and Giuseppe Cocconi in Nature in
1959. Since then, more than 50 searches have been conducted by dozens of
astronomers in at least eight countries. These were primitive efforts, using
equipment designed for other purposes and limited in duration, sensitivity,
number of channels, types of signals and numbers of stars observed. In spite
of these limitations, most of those searches found unexplained signals.
What is new about the Seti programme starting on October 12, says Nasa, is
the technology now available. Existing radio telescopes on Earth are
sensitive enough to detect, at distances of 1,000 light years or more,
signals no more powerful than some now leaving Earth. In addition, advances
in data processing make it possible to sift automatically through millions
of frequency channels each second and, if present, identify signals
transmitted by intelligent societies.
The Seti plan involves two complementary modes. First, there will be an
all-sky search covering nearly 500m channels in the 1,000-10,000 MHz range,
plus spot bands up to 25,000 MHz, using the 34-metre antennas of Nasa's Deep
Space Network. This sky search will cover at least 10,000 times more
frequency space than all previous survey attempts and will be about 300
times more sensitive.
Second, a special targeted search using the largest available radio
telescopes (including Arecibo) will examine nearly 800 sun-like stars within
100 light years of Earth. Some stellar clusters and nearby galaxies will
also be observed. This targeted search will examine 2bn channels over a
frequency range of 1,000-3,000 MHz, plus higher spot bands.
Would we recognise an intelligent signal? Quite easily, apparently.
Would Nasa tell us if it did detect a signal? You will not catch Nasa out
like that. 'Once a signal is confirmed as being of ETI origin, an
announcement of the discovery would be made as quickly and as widely as
possible', it claims. 'One way in which the announcement could be made is
described in a Declaration of Principles Concerning Activities Following the
Detection of Extraterrestrial Intelligence.'
Would we know what the signal meant? Apparently we would. If intentional,
the signal will be anticryptographic - easy to decode. A civilisation bent
on sending messages would probably employ simple tutorial pictures and use
an interstellar Esperanto based on universal physical and mathematical
principles. Conversely, a civilisation's own domestic output - Neighbours of
M13, News At Sixty  - may be difficult to decipher.
Would senders know their messages had been received? No, not unless we
replied. Nasa itself has no plan for replying. As part of the International
Seti Post-Detection Protocol now under consideration, it would be up to the
nations of Earth whether, and how, to reply.
How much will the Seti project cost? The cost for a ten-year period is
described as averaging Dollars 10m a year, or less than 0.1 per cent of
Nasa's budget - 'less', it claims winsomely, 'than a nickel per American per
year.'
Against a background of ballooning US federal budget deficits and the
spectre of US poverty, Nasa has become as skilled as any institution in
fighting its corner and defending its plans.
Even if no signal from space is detected, it says the technology developed
to search for faint signals from distant planets can be applied to more
down-to-Earth problems in medical diagnostic imaging, resource exploration,
aircraft safety and electronics. It will also yield uniquely detailed
astronomical data and have useful spin-offs in education. But if a signal
was detected, why then: 'Information gathered from other civilisations may
provide important practical as well as social and philosophical benefits.'
HOWEVER MANY times Nasa says that Seti has nothing to do with UFO detection
or little green men, it knows it cannot stanch the jokes among the
unsophisticated. In Washington, one politician railed against Seti's 1990-91
budget like this: 'Of course there are flying saucers and advanced
civilisations in outer space. But we don't need to spend Dollars 6m to find
evidence of these rascally creatures. We only need 75 cents to buy a tabloid
at the local supermarket.'
When I finally reached the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, north of Pasadena, I
was asked at the reception desk for photographic ID, plus my 'resident
alien's card.' I explained that I was not a resident alien, merely an alien.
A little later, I described this exchange to Dr Michael J Klein, Seti's
project manager at the JPL, who laughed quite cheerfully, just as Columbus
must have laughed till his face ached while supervising the provisioning of
his ships. Klein's equivalent of provisioning is moving equipment into
California's Mojave desert and supervising numerous other tasks while trying
to ward off budget cuts.
'We are not talking about little green men or space travel', he told me.
'This is not scientific fantasy. Seti is a search. We are not transmitting.
Somebody else will do that. For us, going to the stars is not a 20th century
possibility. It may not be a 28th century possibility, but at least we now
have the means to listen for sounds of other technologies. It's a bit like
cutting an acre of grass. To date, we've used nail-clippers; now we've got a
lawnmower.
'Attitudes among scientists differ. People disagree on the chances of
success, but everybody agrees that it should be done: there is good science
coming out of it.'
For the record, Klein is a church-goer. 'Do I believe in a supreme God? Yes,
I do. I don't have a lot of answers, but I have a lot of awe and faith. I
believe in a Creator who established the laws of physics.'
And - for the record  - yes, Klein does expect that one day Earth will
detect an intelligent signal from somewhere in the Milky Way. 'My guess is
that such a signal will be detected at a distance much greater than ten
light years. I would guess 100 or more. Most of us who work on Seti believe
that some day there will be contact via communication - not space travel.
There won't be dialogue because of the time lags involved, though there may
one day be dialogue between generations. We hope we are the ones who
succeed. At least we are starting things off. It will not prove futile.'
