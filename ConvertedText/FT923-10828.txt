FT  28 JUL 92 / Japanese enterprise bursts into flowers


   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE


AFTER CARS and consumer electronics, Japanese enterprise has turned to a new
international business - growing chrysanthemums.
Japan's national flower - symbol of the country's most exclusive order
founded by Emperor Musto Hiti in 1877 - has been chosen for aggressive
worldwide development.
Kirin, Japan's leading brewer, yesterday announced that it had bought
Britain's biggest breeder and grower of chrysanthemums, Southern Glasshouse
Produce (SGP), for Pounds 3.6m.
The brewer diversified into biotechnology about 10 years ago, and its
researchers have been developing new varieties of vegetables and flowers as
well as new pharmaceuticals.
Kirin is already established in Japan's flower markets, and since 1986 has
been SGP's partner in a venture to breed new varieties of chrysanthemum.
The SGP group, a family-owned company based in Fareham, Hampshire and
founded in 1958 by Mr Emrys Lloyd, a horticulturist, sells more than Pounds
4m of chrysanthemum cuttings and blooms a year.
It produces cuttings in the Canary Islands and the UK for chrysanthemum
growers around the world, notably in Colombia, which grows a billion blooms
a year for the US market, Japan, the Netherlands, Israel and New Zealand.
Blooms for the UK chrysanthemum market, worth an estimated Pounds 130m in
retail sales, are grown under 100 acres of glass in Hampshire and Sussex.
Mr Barrie Machin, one of the world's leading chrysanthemum breeders, heads
the group's research team. Its aim is to produce plants resistant to disease
and low temperatures, and blooms of varied colours and petal arrangements.
Among its successes have been the spray chrysanthemum, known to the Japanese
as edasaki kiku, which has five to 10 flowers on one stem.
Kirin's and SGP's breeding technologies will be combined to develop new
varieties which will be marketed internationally.
