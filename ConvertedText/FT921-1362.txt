FT  24 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures And Options Trading


   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE


A MOOD of political uncertainty continued to hang over the futures market,
sidelining many investors and depressing trading, but the March contract, at
a discount to the cash market for most of yesterday, staged a late rally,
writes Christopher Price.
March opened slightly down at 2,440 before a small rally took it to 2,452,
with independent traders featuring prominently. However, it then began a
decline which found little support, although a few buyers were evident at
the 2,430 level by midday.
The early afternoon saw a further fall and March was dragged down to 2,418
by 2pm. Some support was found at this level, chiefly from Goldman Sachs,
which had been the biggest seller on Friday.
March rallied to 2,432 and further buying took it to 2,444 by the close, the
same level as the previous finish, and at a three-point premium to the cash
market. There were 8,089 contracts traded.
The traded options market had its first day's trading of the newly merged
LTOM and Liffe. One trader reported that changes to margin rules had caught
some people unawares and that other technical teething problems had had some
effect on trading. Turnover was a low 14,447.
