FT  14 APR 94 / UK Company News: Courtaulds Textiles pay boost


Courtaulds Textiles may have suffered a tough 1993, with particular problems
in continental Europe, but recession did not stretch as far as directors'
pay packets.
The company saw earnings per share fall 3 per cent last year and was forced
to issue a profits warning. This was reflected in the lack of
performance-related payments.
The salary of the highest-paid director, Mr Martin Taylor, the
recently-departed chief executive, rose Pounds 18,000 to Pounds 224,000
although this will not have added to the comfort of his last year in the hot
seat. His Pounds 42,000 performance bonus from 1992 was not repeated.
Mr Taylor, who left the company in December to become chief executive at
Barclays, received no renumeration for his role as chairman.
However, two other directors pushed their salaries through the Pounds
150,000 barrier.
