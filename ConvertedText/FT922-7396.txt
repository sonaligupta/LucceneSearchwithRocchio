FT  19 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Land write-downs put Prowting Pounds 17.7m
in red


   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent


PROWTING yesterday became the latest UK housebuilder to announce large
provisions against its land holdings due to sharply falling property values.
Mr Terry Roydon, chief executive, said that after a write-down of more than
Pounds 22m the group incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 17.68m in the 12
months to the end of February.
This compared with a profit of Pounds 7.55m in the previous 12 months and
was struck on turnover down from Pounds 40.8m to Pounds 36.4m. After all
deductions losses per share came out at 18.8p compared with earnings of 6.9p
in 1990-91.
Despite the setback the final dividend is being maintained at 3.3p making a
same again total of 5p.
Mr Roydon said that the company had decided to keep faith with shareholders
on the grounds that: the write - down in land values was a 'one-off' and was
unlikely to be repeated; there were signs that the housing market was
starting to pick up and the group's financial position remained relatively
strong.
He said that dividend payments were 80 per cent covered by earnings before
taking account the large write-down on landholdings.
The average cost in Prowting's books of the 5,400 plots it owns with
planning permission had fallen from Pounds 17,200 to just Pounds 13,000 as a
result of the exceptional provisions. About 2,000 plots were acquired before
1986 at very low prices, said Mr Roydon, which would command a good margin
of profit as the housing market recovered and sites were developed.
The company builds in the west Midlands and southern England, 'everywhere
south of Birmingham.' It has been badly affected by the recession which has
hit hardest in the south of the country. Last year the group sold 273 homes
compared with 296 previously and a peak of 704 in 1988-89.
Average prices of the group's homes have tumbled during this period from
Pounds 141,000 in 1988-89 to Pounds 103,000 last year.
Mr Roydon said the housing market remained very difficult but there were
signs that sales were beginning to pick up.
'During the first four months of this year we have sold about 10 per cent
more homes than during the corresponding period last year. Sales halted
during the general election period but have picked up again since. The
south-west of England market has seen the best improvement as far as our
business is concerned.'
COMMENT
The provisions announced yesterday by Prowting are much higher than the
group needed to make. Even at current prices they leave room for a 25 per
cent gross margin. The company's land bank is sufficient for more than a
dozen years' production, even assuming the group achieves its sales target
of 400 homes this year and still allows for some land sales to help reduce
gearing from its current level of 59 per cent to about 40 per cent by the
end of this year. A Pounds 6.5m tax rebate due in December will assist debt
reduction. The company's long land bank, at cheap prices, makes it a classic
housing recovery stock. The questions investors must ask themselves are:
will the current upturn be sustained or will it peter-out like it did last
summer; and how much of the recovery potential is already reflected in
Prowting's share price? A prospective p/e in the early 30s on pre-tax
profits this year of Pounds 5m suggests that the current price is rich
enough at least until the first question is resolved more clearly.
