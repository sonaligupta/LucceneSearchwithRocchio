FT  23 JUL 93 / International Company News: Efficiency improvements help
Maytag climb 12%


   By MARTIN DICKSON


MAYTAG, the US appliances group which owns Hoover Europe, reported a 12 per
cent increase in second-quarter net income, helped by more efficient
production in North America.
It reported net income of Dollars 21.3m, or 20 cents a share, compared with
Dollars 18.9m, or 18 cents, in the same period of last year - in spite of a
rise in its effective tax rate from 36 per cent to 41.6 per cent.
Sales totalled Dollars 753.3m, down 2.2 per cent, which the company said was
due to currency conversion factors, the sale of its microwave oven business,
and lower vending equipment sales.
Its North American appliance group had operating income of Dollars 53.1m, up
34 per cent. But the increase was due partly to depressed 1992 results
because of plant start-up costs. Sales were up marginally at Dollars 568m.
Hoover Europe suffered an operating loss of Dollars 3.6m, down from Dollars
7.5m, while sales dropped 10.4 per cent, largely because of currency
conversion factors.
In the first quarter, Maytag took a Dollars 30m charge to cover the costs of
a Hoover travel promotion in the UK which backfired. First-half net income,
including that charge, totalled Dollars 10.8m, compared with a Dollars 263m
loss last year after accounting changes.
