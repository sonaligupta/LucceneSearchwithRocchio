FT  01 DEC 94 / Job adverts seen to exclude young


Young people are excluded from applying for work in more than 40 per cent of
jobs, according to a national survey of job advertisements.
The independent Labour Research Department found that employers sought older
employees in 8.5 per cent of 5,368 advertisements in regional newspapers
across the country. A further 35 per cent of posts said that 'experience'
was either required or preferred, including for jobs such as cleaning work
and kitchen help.
