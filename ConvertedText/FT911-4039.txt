FT  22 APR 91 / International Company News: THF offshoot expands


   By STEVE THOMPSON


GARDNER Merchant, the international catering arm of Trusthouse Forte, the
hotels and leisure group, has established itself as the second largest
contract caterer in Australia following its cash purchase of Rowland
Commercial Catering, writes Steve Thompson.
It is paying an initial ADollars 6m (Pounds 2.6m), plus a further
performance-related amount over the next three years, for the Australian
company.
Gardner moves into second place in contract catering after Nationwide
Catering, by far the biggest of Australia's contract catering businesses.
The acquisition of Rowland will increase Gardner's contracts to 125.
Rowland employs over 1,000 personnel and has well-known corporate clients
including Shell, ICI and Coles Myers. It operates restaurants in the Sydney
Opera House and the Art Gallery of New South Wales.
Gardner has made rapid strides in Australia's contract catering industry
since its initial entry in 1988, when it bought Imperial Food Services in
Melbourne.
