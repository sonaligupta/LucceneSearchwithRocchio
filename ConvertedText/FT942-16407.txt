FT  11 APR 94 / Unions urge Pounds 4 per hour minimum


   By ROLAND RUDD


Labour is under pressure from some union leaders to set a figure for its
national minimum wage as high as Pounds 4.05 an hour, Roland Rudd writes.
However, the party said such a figure would never gain support on its
national executive committee. It added: 'There is a document which
underlines current party policy. There are no proposals in it to change
policy and there is no proposal to set a figure for a national minimum
wage.'
Labour faced criticism during the last general election over its policy of a
national minimum wage of Pounds 3.40 an hour and any suggestion that the
level be set at more than this would prove controversial.
The Confederation of British Industry has warned that a minimum wage could
cost industry up to Pounds 50bn a year, with the loss of 100,000 jobs.
Mr John Prescott, shadow employment secretary, fiercely defended the party's
commitment to a minimum wage on ITV's Walden programme yesterday.
He said: 'It's not been proven yet that it will cost any jobs.'
