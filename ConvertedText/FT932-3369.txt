FT  15 JUN 93 / BIS Annual Report: Income inequalities of rich and poor
widen  - A look at the annual report of the Bank for International
Settlements


   By PETER MARSH


PEOPLE in south-east Asia are catching up rapidly with the western world in
terms of income, while those in Africa and Latin America are falling further
behind, according to the Bank for International Settlements' (BIS) annual
report.
While the average person in China, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong
Kong experienced income growth of up to about 7 per cent during the 1980s,
incomes in Latin America and Africa fell during the decade, due to economic
stagnation and rapidly rising populations.
Illustrating the widening differences between the poorest and richest
nations, the study says the poorest 20 per cent of the global population in
1960 received only 5 per cent of the world's income.
By 1990, this fraction had fallen still further - to 3.4 per cent. Over the
same period, and excluding China where strong economic development in the
1980s has greatly eased poverty, the richest 20 per cent of the world's
people saw their share of total incomes increase from 58.3 per cent to 64.6
per cent.
The study points out that better schools, curbs on population growth and
factory investment to boost exports are all keys to increasing the wealth of
the earth's poorest nations.
It says the experiences of the past 30 years, in which rich nations have
increased their lead over the world's economic also-rans, 'cast doubt on the
widely held assumption that poor countries will generally gain, relative to
more advanced countries, due to the spill-over of technology and capital
inflows'.
Between 1960 and 1990, the fifth of the world's population which lives in
China increased its share of world incomes from 7.3 per cent to 11.5 per
cent.
Economic advance in China was particularly substantial during the 1980s,
when the income of the average person increased 6.9 per cent a year. Over
the same period, incomes in the rapidly industrialising bloc of South Korea,
Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong expanded by 5.6 per cent a year.
However, during the 1980s, per capita incomes in Latin America and Africa
fell by 0.8 per cent and 0.3 per cent a year respectively.
This was despite good progress in both these regions during the 1960s and
1970s, when the comparable figures had been between 2 per cent and 3.1 per
cent.
In 1990, the average citizen in South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong
received an income only 17 per cent below the average in the rich
industrialised world - this is substantially better than in 1960, when
incomes were 69 per cent less than in the west.
However, progress in this respect was markedly different in Latin America
and Asia, where in 1990 incomes were roughly one-third and one-tenth
respectively of the equivalent figures in the developed world.
Thirty years earlier, the corresponding fractions had been significantly
higher, at 41 per cent and 17 per cent respectively.
