FT  14 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Lasmo cash call


   By JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON


There were very few raised eyebrows in the oil sector of the market as Lasmo
confirmed recent strong speculation of a big rights issue to bolster the
group's balance sheet and help fund the development of new projects.
Lasmo shares dipped to 125p as the cash raising operation news emerged but
later stabilised to close only a penny off at 128p. The market took the news
reasonably well although it was pointed out that many of the big US
investment houses were seen to be offering Lasmo stock during the afternoon;
'the US response to the issue will be crucial,' said one leading UK broker.
Strauss Turnbull said the market had heaved a sigh of relief at the
appearance of the rights issue and advised holders to 'take up their rights,
but exploit any short term enthusiasm in the shares,' which it described as
'over-rated stock in an over-rated sector.'
Goldman Sachs, on the other hand, focused on Lasmo's cash multiple saying:
'If Lasmo were to trade on a comparable multiple to the US companies in 1996
the share price would have to rise to 191p. In the aftermath of the rights
issue the stock overhang may lead to a dull performance but in the longer
term we continue to rate Lasmo a market outperformer.'
RMC was one of the FT-SE 100's star performers after the building materials
group delivered top of the range preliminary figures, including a 5 per cent
increase in the dividend. Analysts had been split on the likelihood of an
increase in the payment. The 21p total was the most optimistic forecast in
the market. RMC shares rose 16, or 1.7 per cent, to 966p, after 972p.
Turnover was 938,000 shares.
Aerospace and medical equipment group Smiths Industries jumped 15 to 485p,
in trade of 1.7m after it reported an increase in interim profits. A slight
adjustment in full year expectations was made by several brokers. These
included NatWest Securities which moved its forecast from Pounds 113.5 to
Pounds 114.5m saying 'it was a creditable performance from Smiths.' However,
Mr Paul Compton at Credit Lyonnais was more cautious and said: 'underlying
sales growth is minimal and margins are already 14 per cent so I see no
further upside.'
British Airways shed 4 1/2 to 439p, on fears of increased competition
following the announcement of a transatlantic partnership between Virgin
Atlantic and US carrier Delta Air Lines.
Chemicals group BOC slid 15 to 686p as Hoare Govett reiterated its sell
stance arguing that competitive prices and low inflation would lead to
'pedestrian growth'.
W Canning improved 2 to 180p, reacting to a recent buy note from Smith New
Court. Turnover in Takare the nursing homes group leapt to 25m. Shortly
before the market closed the group announced that Mr Dev Pritchard, the
former deputy chairman and co-founder of the company, had sold 12.5m shares
or 10 per cent of the company reducing his holding to a nominal 97,456
shares. The stake was placed with UK and US institutions by Credit Lyonnais
Laing at 249p a share and the underlying share price held steady at 258p.
Claremont Garments shares began trading in their new form following the
offer for Magellan Industries becoming unconditional. The stock fell 5 to
365p.
Marks and Spencer added 2 1/2 to 424p with UBS said to have upgraded profit
expectations. Speculative buying again boosted turnover in Brown & Jackson,
40m shares being turned over, with the price steady at 5 3/4 p.
The potential break-up price put on Thorn EMI by UBS continued to excite the
shares, advancing 12 to 1156p.
Tour operators were in demand following reports of new charter destinations.
Airtours was further buoyed on continued talk of takeover ambitions, with a
Swedish travel group said to be favourite. The shares gained 10 to 496p.
Owners Abroad added 3 1/2 to 117 1/2 p.
Pizza Express steadied at 123p as it was revealed that the chairman had sold
2m shares - or 3.8 per cent of the company - at 120p a share. They were
placed with institutional clients by Greig Middleton and Credit Lyonnais
Laing.
A return to profits by the Savoy hotel group saw the shares edge forward 5
to 1130p.
The departure of the finance director at HP Bulmer, the cider maker, saw the
shares slide 8 to 400p. Big switching was reported between Grand
Metropolitan, off 13 at 465p, and Guinness, 6 1/2 up at 469p.
Reuters Holdings recovered 24 to 1980p with Henderson Crosthwaite, the
agency broker, arguing that Monday's share split will add 50p to the share
price.
Mirror Group added 2 at 178p and Euromoney 8 at 1643p as Kleinwort Benson
reiterated its support for the two companies as 'cheaper advertising linked
businesses'.
