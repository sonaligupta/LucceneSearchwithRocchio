FT  20 APR 91 / UK Company News: Scot Heritable dives Pounds 16m into loss
after provisions


   By RICHARD GOURLAY


SCOTTISH HERITABLE Trust, the conglomerate, yesterday delivered a set of
results considerably worse than its profits warning last November, writes
Richard Gourlay.
In 1990 its losses were Pounds 15.89m (Pounds 10.08m profits), after making
a Pounds 7m provision covering the reduction in value of properties in St
James Development Trust. Turnover rose to Pounds 116.06m (Pounds 113.56m).
Mr Robin Garland, the chief executive, resigned just before the results,
following the finance director who left last December and has yet to be
replaced. Sir Ian MacGregor, the former head of British Steel and the
National Coal Board, is a non-executive director.
The final dividend is passed (4p), leaving a total of 1.5p (7p). After an
Pounds 8.41m extraordinary charge (Pounds 514,000 gain), losses per share
came to 59.7p (earnings 19.3p).
Mr Neil Butterworth, the group accountant, said that Pounds 4.1m of the
extraordinary item related to the closure of the Alabama-based modular
housebuilding subsidiary.
The balance covered the closure of textile businesses, anticipated losses
from the future sale of the John Letters golf club manufacturer, a Pounds
2.6m provision for debt due from joint-venture property companies and a
Pounds 1.7m charge for bank and valuers' fees connected with the arrangement
of new banking facilities.
As a result of the reduction in shareholders' funds, gearing on Pounds 66.4m
net debt rose to more than 300 per cent - shareholders are to be asked to
approve a temporary waiver of the borrowing limits.
On the operating side, the Scottish oriental carpet business plunged to
losses of Pounds 5.15m (profits Pounds 1.66m), following stiff competition
from Chinese imports which drove prices down.
Building and quarrying also fell to losses of Pounds 2.52m (profits Pounds
4.62m). Although Standard Fireworks achieved record results, the
manufacturing division did not perform well, falling to profits of Pounds
1.14m (Pounds 1.6m).
