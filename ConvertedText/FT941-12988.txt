FT  27 JAN 94 / International Company News: Strength of ambition fuels steel
group - Shougang wants to be China's first multi-national


   By ALEXANDER NICOLL


Shougang Corporation wants to be more than one of the biggest steel
companies in a country which has a desperate need for steel to fuel an
economic boom.
'Our aim is to become a multi-national, world class enterprise by the year
2000,' says Mr Zhou Beifang, chairman of the group's Hong Kong holding
company.
The company, which has 24 subsidiaries and affiliates in 15 countries
including the US, also plans a huge increase in domestic capacity to put it
among the top three steel companies in the world.
Shougang, which is entirely state-owned, has no plans to sell shares to
employees or to seek listings for the parent company on stock exchanges
either in China or elsewhere, according to Mr Luo Bingsheng, its president.
Nevertheless, Mr Luo and Mr Zhou have embarked on a round-the-world tour to
present the group to the investment community.
Its international ambitions are led by Shougang Concord International
Enterprises, one of four subsidiaries listed in Hong Kong, which last year
made a Dollars 183m convertible bond issue.
The group plans to use its presence in Hong Kong as the base for further
expansion into the rest of Asia as well as Europe and North America. Mr Zhou
says steel markets in south-east Asia are very promising and that Shougang
would like a presence there - subsidiaries may seek stock market listings in
Malaysia and Singapore.
The group also plans to build steel plants outside China on a contract
basis.
Shougang is unusual among Chinese state-owned companies, though not only
because it makes a profit. It was one of the earliest to acquire a measure
of management autonomy under the economic reforms which Mr Deng Xiaoping,
China's leader, introduced in 1978.
Its independence has since increased to the extent that it is allowed to
engage autonomously in investment, finance and foreign trade - it has even
been able to set up a bank. Shougang is responsible directly to the State
Council, China's equivalent of the cabinet, and not to the ministry of
metallurgical industry, which oversees other steel producers.
The company has extraordinarily good connections. It makes liberal use of
photographs of Mr Deng Xiaoping visiting its main iron and steel works just
outside Beijing in May 1992. Mr Deng Zhifang, the leader's son, is on the
board of Shougang Concord Grand, another Hong Kong-listed subsidiary.
In Hong Kong, the group has struck up an alliance with Mr Li Ka-shing, the
tycoon whose main company, Cheung Kong, owns 12 per cent of Shougang Concord
International.
Some of the group's holdings in mainland joint ventures have already been
assumed by Shougang Concord International, which has been in rapid
transformation since it was acquired as Tung Wing Steel in October 1992. Mr
Zhou says Shougang also plans to inject a 51 per cent interest in a new
rolled steel venture and 'will continue to inject assets in accordance with
market conditions'.
Most of the group's international activities thus far have in fact been
directed at boosting Shougang's position within China. In 1992 it paid
Dollars 120m for an iron ore mine in Peru, which it is using to feed its
steel plants at home.
Although the company's executives talk of Hong Kong as a window on the
world, where 'China's industrial capital joins the world's financial
capital', a large part of its role in the group is to finance mainland
activities. Hong Kong companies which invest in the mainland count as
foreign and obtain beneficial tax treatment.
Shougang's primary goal is to become China's largest steel producer -
currently it is the third largest crude steel maker and second largest
manufacturer of steel products. It aims to produce 10m tonnes of crude steel
this year - up from 5.7m in 1992, and to expand capacity to 20m tonnes by
2000. This increase would come through a new joint venture in Shandong
province with Cheung Kong.
The group's ambitions - and those of investors eager to get a piece of
China's boom - face a number of uncertainties. Like all Chinese state-owned
companies, Shougang will one day have to face up to the financial burden
created by 280,000 employees, for whom it has to provide from cradle to
grave.
More immediately, it will need to establish equilibrium in its fast-changing
listed subsidiaries: a research report by Salomon Brothers says of its
profit estimates for Shougang Concord International: 'Given the fluid nature
of the company, these numbers must be viewed as merely rough indications of
trend and magnitude.' Salomon sees rapid growth in earnings, though it sees
as risks changes in Chinese steel import tariffs, currency fluctuations and
slippage in implementation of the expansion plans.
Shougang also depends on the success of economic policy, which has produced
a series of booms and busts since reforms began. If government austerity
measures taken last year fail to curb inflation and speculation, Beijing
could be forced to bring about a 'hard landing'. Mr Luo says the measures
brought down steel prices last year but that they have been rising again so
far in 1994.
