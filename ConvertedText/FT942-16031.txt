FT  12 APR 94 / World Stock Markets: Copenhagen Airport at discount


   By HILARY BARNES


   COPENHAGEN


The first trading day of shares in the Copenhagen Airport privisation offer
was a disappointment to investors.
The shares closed at DKr291 yesterday, compared with the DKr310 which was
the striking price after the Danish government offered its 25 per cent stake
at an indicative price range of between DKr285 and DKr315 before Easter.
One broker commented that the international consortium behind the issue may
have priced it too tightly for Danish conditions.
The fate of the airport issue was watched with special interest because of
the upcoming Tele Danmark privatisation issue which is expected to pull in a
massive Dollars 3bn.
The Tele Danmark issue is currently on offer. The first trading day will be
April 28, when the Copenhagen Stock Exchange will remain open late to enable
trading to take place simultaneously in Copenhagen and New York.
