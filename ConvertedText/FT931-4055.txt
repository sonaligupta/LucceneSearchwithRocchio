FT  12 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Write-down puts AB Ports in red


   By ANDREW BOLGER


ASSOCIATED BRITISH Ports Holdings yesterday wiped out its annual profits by
taking a provision of Pounds 83.6m against the drop in the value of its
property development portfolio.
The write-down caused ABP to incur a pre-tax loss of Pounds 36.6m in 1992,
compared with a profit of Pounds 31m last time.
Sir Keith Stuart, chairman, said the property revaluations were intended to
'clear the decks.' They had been specifically commissioned so as to remove
uncertainty about the value of the group's property development portfolio,
which had affected City sentiment. ABP shares closed 2p higher at 403p.
Sir Keith said that group properties had now been written down to their
open-market value, independently assessed.
ABP said that the recession had continued to depress some of the
higher-earning trades through the group's ports, with the result that
second-half throughput and profitability were lower. Nevertheless, it
described the ports' performance as resilient.
Ports and transport profits fell from Pounds 70.8m to Pounds 64.7m, before
severance costs of Pounds 4m (Pounds 600,000). About 200 jobs were shed last
year, reducing the number of group employees in the ports to 2,000.
Total tonnage last year was down slightly from 106m to 105m tonnes. Tonnages
relating to the chemical and construction industries, such as fertilisers,
cement and timber, were at reduced levels.
ABP said its larger ports performed particularly well, with another record
level of tonnage at Immingham and Hull, and strong growth at Southampton.
Port-related property income was Pounds 20.1m (Pounds 18.5m). Profit from
other property investments was Pounds 9.1m (Pounds 7.9m).
Net borrowings on the balance sheet of Pounds 349m (Pounds 332m) meant
gearing rose from 55 per cent to 60 per cent. Off-balance sheet borrowings
fell to Pounds 15m (Pounds 26m). The interest charge rose to Pounds 39.1m
(Pounds 36.6m).
Losses per share were 14.3p, compared with earnings of 12.4p in 1991.
Nevertheless, the board said it felt the dividend should reflect the
underlying strength of the business. A proposed final of 5.25p gives a total
for the year of 8.5p (8p).
