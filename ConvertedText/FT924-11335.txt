by price rises

ATLANTIC RICHFIELD (Arco), the Los Angeles-based oil and gas company,
yesterday turned in higher underlying third-quarter earnings, reflecting
higher crude oil and domestic natural gas prices.
Net income for the quarter to September 30 was Dollars 332m, or Dollars 2.06
a share, against a net loss of Dollars 156m, or 99 cents, including a large
one-off charge last year. Sales and revenues rose to Dollars 4.82bn from
Dollars 4.38bn.
During the 1991 quarter, Arco took after-tax charges of about Dollars 340m
to cover job cuts, reorganisation, property sales and write-downs.
Oil and gas exploration and production brought in earnings of Dollars 232m
after tax in the 1992 quarter. A year earlier, exploration and production
had a loss of Dollars 72m, including net charges of about Dollars 180m.
Phillips Petroleum, the Oklahoma-based energy and chemicals group, yesterday
posted a third-quarter profits advance, lifting net income to Dollars 99m,
or 38 cents a share, from Dollars 56m, or 21 cents. Revenues edged ahead to
Dollars 3.13bn from Dollars 3.11bn last time.
Mr C. J. Silas, chairman and chief executive, said exploration and
production earnings were helped by higher prices, particularly for domestic
natural gas and natural gas liquids.
Earnings from downstream operations were hurt by higher feedstock costs and
plant turnrounds. The results, however, were distorted by extraordinary
items.
Third-quarter results from Unocal, the California-based energy group, were
muddied by one-time items which brought net income to Dollars 11m, or 1
cent, after dividends on preferred stock, compared with earnings of Dollars
9m, or 4 cents, a year earlier.
Excluding special items, Unocal earned Dollars 65m, or 24 cents, in the
latest quarter, against Dollars 23m, or 10 cents. Revenues were Dollars
2.51bn against Dollars 2.68bn.
For the first nine months, it earned Dollars 117m, or 46 cents, on revenues
of Dollars 7.6bn, compared with Dollars 89m, or 38 cents, on revenues of
Dollars 8.13bn.
Eliminating one-time items, nine-month earnings were Dollars 143m, or 57
cents, against Dollars 96m, or 41 cents, last year.
Like Phillips, Unocal said third-quarter earnings were boosted by higher
natural gas prices. Higher crude oil prices also helped earnings.
Mr Richard Stegemeier, chairman and chief executive, said restructuring and
workforce reductions were expected to contribute Dollars 200m to after-tax
cash-flow in 1993.
