FT  06 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Reuters squeezed higher


   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and ZHANG TINGTING


NEWS AND information group Reuters Holdings rose sharply yesterday on
enthusiastic US buying, strong recommendation from UK sources and an acute
shortage of stock.
The shares, which are subject to a buy-back offer from the company, jumped
55 to 1515p. Just before the close of trading in London the appetite for
stock was so great that trading screens showed a backwardation, a technical
situation whereby the bid and offer quotes are reversed. One hour after the
London close, 1.6m shares had been traded in New York, where the equivalent
price reached 1530p.
Dealers said that Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, was recommending
Reuters strongly. Also, US brokerage house Merrill Lynch published a buy
recommendation, highlighting improved prospects for foreign exchange dealing
following widening of the European exchange rate mechanism bands. Some 60
per cent of Reuters' business is linked to foreign exchange dealing.
In London, Henderson Crosthwaite, the agency broker, also published a buy
note. Analyst Mr Brian Newman focused on the buy-back scheme, which
technically offers the chance to receive 1400p a share, but around 1720p for
tax-exempt gross income funds.
He estimates that 35 per cent of the equity is held by these funds, who are
refusing to let go of their highly valued shares before the tender on August
25. 'An acute stock shortage has developed in London,' said Mr Newman.
There was also talk of a stock lending crisis. Stock lending is a device
whereby marketmakers can borrow shares from institutions to balance their
books.
