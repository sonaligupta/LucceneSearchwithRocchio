FT  01 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Bromsgrove Industries cut to Pounds 7.1m as
recession bites


   By ANGUS FOSTER


BROMSGROVE Industries, the Birmingham-based specialist engineering group,
announced a fall in profits as the recession and falling margins affected
its main automotive and aerospace divisions.
Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 8.85m to Pounds 7.09m in the year to March
31.
However, the results were hailed by Mr Bijan Sedghi, chairman, as proof of
Bromsgrove's resilience compared to its competitors. Mr Steven Mills, chief
executive, said: 'We do believe there are plenty of opportunities to go
forward.'
Turnover increased 8.8 per cent to Pounds 90.1m, helped by a first-time
contribution from environmental businesses acquired last year.
Aerospace was affected by postponed civil aircraft orders and defence cuts,
but offshore companies performed well, and plastics had a better second
half.
Interest costs increased slightly to Pounds 2.86m (Pounds 2.58m) and the
proceeds of a Pounds 10m rights issue were not received until close to the
year-end. Following the rights, gearing fell from 94 per cent to 50 per cent
on net borrowings of Pounds 19.6m.
Earnings per share, fully diluted for the rights issue, fell to 11p (14.8p).
A recommended final dividend of 2.5p makes a total of 4p (3.9p).
Extraordinary losses totalled Pounds 1.15m (Pounds 2.93m) and included
business closures in the industrial division and Pounds 224,000 of costs on
the aborted acquisitions of two companies.
