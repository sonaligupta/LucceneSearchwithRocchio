FT  27 MAY 93 / International Company News: Swiss show unease over airline
plan for link-up

THE Swiss government has for the first time indicated unease about Swissair
joining an alliance with three other European airlines.
It has ordered the company to put forward alternative plans that would
guarantee its independence.
The decision throws uncertainty over plans by Swissair, Scandinavian
Airlines System (SAS), KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Austrian Airlines to
merge their operations into a joint company.
Their merger is intended to form a 'fourth force' in the European airline
industry to compete against the big three European airlines: British
Airways, Lufthansa of Germany and Air France.
A Swiss newspaper claimed the alliance would result in the suppression of
the Swissair name, the loss of 10,000 Swissair jobs, and the movement of
important decision-making to Amsterdam.
Swissair denied this, saying its name would be preserved in the medium-term,
as would Zurich as a decision centre. Moreover, the job loss figure was
'wildly exaggerated'.
Mr Casanova said Swissair's future had a 'political dimension', since the
airline was 20 per cent owned by Swiss public authorities, including the
federal government with a 7 per cent stake.
Similar opposition to the four-carrier alliance has already broken out in
Austria, where Lufthansa is understood to be discussing with Austrian
Airlines an alternative commercial partnership agreement.
If the Lufthansa talks are successful, and Austrian Airlines opts for an
alliance with the German carrier, this would represent a further blow for
the four-airline alliance.
The partners in the venture are seeking to set up a joint operating company
by the beginning of next year to respond to increasing globalisation of the
airline industry.
