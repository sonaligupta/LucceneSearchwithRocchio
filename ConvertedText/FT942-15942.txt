FT  13 APR 94 / Building industry hiring rate rises


   By ANDREW TAYLOR


The construction industry is hiring twice as many permanent staff as it did
during the corresponding period last year, says a survey commissioned by the
Chartered Institute of Building, Andrew Taylor writes.
The survey, conducted by Montrose Technical Recruitment, provides further
evidence of a broad-based recovery in one of the industries worst affected
by the recession.
Montrose, which claims to be the largest recruitment consultancy
specialising in the construction industry, said: 'We have experienced a
substantial increase in requirements from construction employers with a 44
per cent increase in registered job vacancies compared with the first three
months of last year.
'The number of people we have placed with construction companies is almost
double that of the corresponding period in 1993.'
The consultancy said the industry had lost a large number of highly skilled
professionals during the recession. As a result it was finding it difficult
to identify enough high-calibre candidates in key areas.
'Housing professionals in particular are in short supply,' Montrose said.
The survey followed the publication on Monday of the most optimistic
forecast for construction output since 1989.
The National Council of Building Material Producers, representing companies
with a combined annual turnover of more than Pounds 30bn, predicted that the
value of UK construction output, measured in constant 1990 prices, would
rise by 2 per cent this year.
