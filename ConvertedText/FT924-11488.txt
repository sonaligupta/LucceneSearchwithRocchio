FT  26 OCT 92 / Parcelforce sale is studied


   By ALISON SMITH


MINISTERS are examining aspects of European Community competition policy as
part of work on privatising Parcelforce, the loss-making parcel delivery arm
of the Post Office.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said in July that the
government intended to privatise the organisation as soon as possible, but
ministers are conscious that Parcelforce stands to lose its exemption from
value added tax once it ceases to be part of the Post Office.
The issue has been highlighted by Mr Peter Hain, Labour MP for Neath, who
has written to Mr Heseltine, demanding a statement to the House of Commons
on how the government intends to deal with the loss of VAT exempt status.
He says that would mean Parcelforce customers facing rises of at least 17.5
per cent, and argues that losing VAT exemption would jeopardise the
profitability of the business, making it less attractive for potential
purchasers.
Parcelforce has the leading 34 per cent share of ordinary parcel deliveries
but only 2 per cent of the premium 'next-day' market. Its turnover for
1991-92 was Pounds 508m and it lost Pounds 24m.
Mr Heseltine indicated in the summer that the government would make
available financial support so that management and employees could make a
bid.
