FT  25 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Sharp fall to Pounds 1.1m at Mallett


Mallett, the London antique dealer in which House of Fraser holds a 29.93
per cent interest, suffered a sharp fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds
3.66m to Pounds 1.12m in 1991. Turnover dived 42 per cent to Pounds 8.39m,
against Pounds 14.6m.
Mr Rex Cooper, chairman, said the art market was suffering its worst
reversal since the Second World War and a deepening of the recession,
together with the increased overheads of the new building at 141 New Bond
Street, had hit sales and margins.
Profits this time included an exceptional credit of Pounds 660,000. Earnings
per share tumbled to 5.96p (17.27p) and the dividend has been cut to 4.5p
(6p) with a proposed final of 3p (4p).
