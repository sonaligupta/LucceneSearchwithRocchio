FT  10 JAN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Pressure remains on sterling


STERLING remained very close to its lowest permitted limit within the
European exchange rate mechanism yesterday, trading just above a floor of
around DM2.83.
However, the UK currency was steady for most of the day against the D-Mark,
suggesting that traders were unwilling to risk being caught by concerted
central bank intervention and were not ready to push sterling through its
ERM floor.
Having closed on Wednesday in London at DM2.8350, sterling moved lower still
in New York and Far Eastern trading, for a time dipping below DM2.83.
However, trading of sterling against the D-Mark is very limited outside of
European markets and the weakness was attributed to the movement of both
currencies against the dollar.
By the European opening the pound had recovered ground to trade at DM2.8385
by mid-morning. During the afternoon session this level was maintained until
a bout of weakness just minutes before the close took it down to DM2.8300.
However, this was short-lived and the UK currency had soon recovered to
DM2.8340 in New York trading.
The dollar continued to gain ground on the D-Mark and the yen, climbing 2
pfennigs in Tokyo trading to close there at DM1.5275, and at Y124.65.
Analysts said the recovery in the fortunes of the dollar was due to traders
covering short positions built up earlier in the week.
The rise of the dollar was also boosted by automatic stop-loss trading
programmes, which caused buying of the US currency once it had broken
through DM1.52.
In European trading the firm tone continued, and the dollar closed at
DM1.5475 and Y125.45 in London, near to the highest rates of the day. In New
York the US unit finished stronger at DM1.5605 and Y125.82.
US producer price statistics for December were seen as neutral for the
dollar. An index of the main prices declined by 0.2 per cent during the
month, in line with most forecasts. The index slipped by 0.1 per cent during
the whole of 1991, against an increase of 5.7 per cent during 1990.
Today, non-farm employment statistics for December are scheduled for
release. In recent months a poor employment figure has been the spur for
monetary easing.
Analysts are expecting an increase in unemployment of between 30,000 and
100,000 for the month. A larger figure, combined with the weak inflation
statistics released yesterday, will be seen as increasing the chances of a
cut in US interest rates. This could undermine the recovery of the dollar
over the past two days.
The Australian currency came under selling pressure following a full
percentage point reduction in interest rates to 7.5 per cent on Wednesday.
The Australian dollar weakened yesterday to USDollars 0.7437 from around
USDollars 0.7560 on Wednesday, prompting intervention by the US and
Australian central banks.
