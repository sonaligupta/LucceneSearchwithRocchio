FT  21 DEC 92 / Observer: Return of the Lynch mob


Remember Gerry Tsai? In his hey-day as a go-go stock picker for Fidelity,
America's biggest mutual fund manager, Tsai's reputation was just as big as
that of Peter Lynch, the legendary Fidelity fund manager who has just
announced a comeback.
But whereas Tsai went on to the real business world, running American Can
and its successor Primerica, Lynch is sticking to what he knows best. Less
than three years after he gave up, Lynch is returning to his old firm on a
part-time basis.
Lynch's recall is bound to raise eyebrows on Wall Street. Since he quit
managing Fidelity's Dollars 21bn flagship Magellan fund, it has failed to
match the spectacular performance it recorded during his 13-year
stewardship. The job of running the biggest US mutual fund has already burnt
out one of Lynch's successors. Has Lynch been recalled to keep an eye on
Magellan and prevent its small investors from deserting?
Not so, says Fidelity, which insists that Lynch is not returning to active
stock-picking. He has been acting as a 'mentor and educator' at Fidelity on
an informal basis for some time and now will get paid for 'Peter Lynching
the next generation of Fidelity fund managers,' says Fidelity rather
inelegantly.
