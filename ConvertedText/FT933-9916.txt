FT  06 AUG 93 / International Company News: Japan finalises timetable for
flotation of regional railway


   By EMIKO TERAZONO


   TOKYO


EAST JAPAN Railway, one of Japan's seven state-owned regional railway
companies, will start accepting bids today for its share auction ahead of a
public offering in October.
The government was last year forced to postpone JR East's flotation because
of the plunging Tokyo stock market.
Stockbrokers and the ministry of finance are hoping that the listing will
bring back confidence among individual investors, who have been
disillusioned by the fall in the share price of Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone, which is part-owned by the government.
The auction procedure is an attempt by the government, which faced mounting
criticism over the initial high pricing of the NTT offer, to keep the offer
price of JR East at a reasonable level.
NTT shares, offered publicly in 1986 at Y1.197m, soared to Y3.18m the
following year. However, the stock fell to an all-time low of Y453,000 last
August, prompting criticism that it was offered at an inflated price by the
government.
The outcome of the JR East listing will affect the timing of that of other
government-owned companies, including Japan Tobacco and the remaining six
railway groups.
The government also intends to float the remaining 65.7 per cent stake that
it holds in NTT.
Half of the 4m shares owned by JNR Settlement, which holds debts and shares
of Japan National Railways, the former national railway operator, will be
offered in the first tranche.
JNR Settlement will auction 600,000 shares, and will fix a price for the
remaining 1.4m shares based on an weighted average of the auction bids.
Investors, including foreigners and individuals, may take part in the
auction by submitting bids for a minimum of 50 shares by August 11.
Successful bids will be decided on August 26, and the initial public
offering price fixed on August 30.
