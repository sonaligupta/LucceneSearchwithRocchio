FT  20 APR 94 / World News in Brief: Bankers Trust reports plunge in trading
profits


Turmoil in international financial markets in February and March all but
wiped out reported trading profits at Bankers Trust, the US commercial bank
which has been one of the pioneers of derivatives markets. The bank said
trading income was Dollars 14m (Pounds 9.5m) in the first quarter of the
year, down from a record Dollars 449m in the previous three months and
Dollars 346m in the first quarter of 1993. However, it said Dollars 177m,
reported as net interest income, had been earned on holdings of bonds. If
this is added in, overall trading income was Dollars 191m, compared with
Dollars 463m in the first quarter of 1993. Page 25; They've got a hold on
