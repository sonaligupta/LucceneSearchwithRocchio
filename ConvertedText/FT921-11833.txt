FT  30 JAN 92 / Gallup tunes into Russian television viewing habits


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


GALLUP, the international polling organisation best known for trying to
predict the outcome of elections, is turning its attention to television
viewing habits in Russia and other former Soviet republics.
The company announced yesterday in London and Moscow that it was setting up
modern ratings research for a market of more than 300m viewers. The Russian
Media Monitor will be based on a panel of 6,000 viewers who will keep a
diary of the programmes they watch.
The main purpose of the monitor is to see how western-sponsored programmes
and advertising are received in the Russian television market. One of the
first programmes to be assessed in Russia will be the BBC documentary series
'The Second Russian Revolution' sponsored by Upjohn, the pharmaceutical
company.
The launch coincides with several programme sponsorship campaigns aimed at
Russia, including the world music series 'Mega Mix', sponsored by Mars
International, and a series of rock music concerts sponsored by Pepsi-Cola.
Mr Gordon Heald, managing director of Gallup (UK) said yesterday: 'It's a
breakthrough in this territory, following years of unstructured market
analysis'. The monitor is a joint venture between Gallup, BBDO, the
international advertising agency, and Invizible Arts, a sponsorship agency.
