FT  22 OCT 94 / Guardian Royal to shed 220 jobs


Changes in the financial services division of Guardian Royal Exchange, the
insurance group, to provide a single support unit for both its direct sales
force and the sales agents who act as its appointed representatives will
mean the loss of 220 jobs in the next six months.
It will continue to run a separate service for supporting sales made through
independent financial advisers.
Guardian said yesterday some 60 of the jobs were either vacant or filled by
people transferring in the company.
