FT  05 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Squeeze on margins restricts Dart rise


Dart Group, the Dorset-based aviation services and forwarding and
distribution company, achieved a modest increase in profits for the 12
months to end-March.
After almost doubled interest charges of Pounds 256,000 (Pounds 133,000),
pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 1.88m, up from Pounds 1.8m last time.
Mr Philip Meeson, chairman, said the small growth reflected pressure on
margins throughout the group's activities, especially in the second six
months. Progress in the current year would be 'steady rather than
spectacular'.
Turnover improved 15 per cent to Pounds 37.4m (Pounds 32.4m). A proposed
increased final dividend of 2p, makes a total of 3.3p (3p), payable from
earnings of 9.4p (9.7p) per share.
