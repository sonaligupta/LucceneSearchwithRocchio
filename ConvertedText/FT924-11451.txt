FT  26 OCT 92 / Letter: Supply side beyond the means of the market alone


   From Ms SUSIE SYMES


Sir, Could you not have slipped a sample of snake oil inside your issue of
October 22, as glossy magazines do with perfume? I needed something for my
own depression after reading Samuel Brittan's Economic Viewpoint. Whatever
happened to supply-side policies? Not in the limited sense of freeing-up
markets,but policies directed towards potential output.
Investments in human capital, in environmental, transport and social
infrastructure, all contribute to a greater capacity to produce at lower
cost. Most of these activities could usefully employ those who would
otherwise remain permanently unemployed; and provide the demand impetus
needed, with the insurance that not all the proceeds can be frittered away
in the short term. And no, the market will not provide all the long-term
infrastructure investment our society needs, precisely because the benefits
accrue more widely than to today's business investors alone.
