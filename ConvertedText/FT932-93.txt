FT  30 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Caledonia advances by 38% to Pounds 36m


   By MAGGIE URRY


CALEDONIA Investments, the investment holding company 48 per cent owned by
the Cayzer family, increased pre-tax profits 38 per cent, from Pounds 26.1m
to Pounds 36m, in the year to March 31.
Net assets per share rose from 472p to 559p.
The shares rose 25p to 484p, compared to a price of 355p at which the group
bought back 10 per cent of its equity a year ago.
Results benefited from a first time contribution from the 27 per cent stake
in Exco, included for seven months, and a nine month (five month)
contribution from the 45 per cent owned Bristow Helicopters.
Profits from trading activities - subsidiary and associate companies - rose
from Pounds 6.9m to Pounds 15.7m.
Such trading profits are expected to increase as a proportion of the whole,
but will mean slower dividend growth as the group believes a higher level of
cover is needed from trading earnings than from investment income.
Income from investments fell from Pounds 18.6m to Pounds 12.9m, but the
comparable figure included Pounds 6.8m from British & Commonwealth
preference shares. Net interest received dropped from Pounds 12.2m to Pounds
11m, as rates were lower and net cash balances fell from Pounds 206m to
Pounds 142m.
Cash represented about 30 per cent of shareholders' funds at the year end.
Mr Peter Buckley, chief executive, said the net asset value might have risen
faster had that money been invested during the year, but Caledonia had taken
a selective attitude to investment opportunities.
There was a Pounds 700,000 loss on the sale of investments (Pounds 3.3m) and
no new provisions were made, compared to a Pounds 5.3m provision the
previous year.
Earnings per share were up from 18p to 26.1p, excluding the effect of losses
and provisions, or from 24.1p to 26.9p including them.
A final dividend of 10p is proposed to give a 15p (14.4p) total.
