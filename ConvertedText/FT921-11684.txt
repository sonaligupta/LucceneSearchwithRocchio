FT  30 JAN 92 / IMF gives Dollars 2.1bn loan to Brazil


THE BOARD of the International Monetary Fund last night approved a Dollars
2.1bn stand-by loan for Brazil which should pave the way for accords with
the country's creditors, report Christina Lamb in Sao Paulo and agencies.
There is, however, doubt over the government's ability to meet the economic
targets needed to secure later disbursements under the loan. The money is to
be disbursed in seven equal quarterly instalments, the first to be released
now there is board approval and later tranches dependent on economic
perfomance.
In its letter of intent, Brazil has pledged to turn its fiscal deficit into
a surplus of 2.4 per cent of GDP, and to bring down monthly inflation (24
per cent last month) to 2 per cent by year-end. Latest indicators, though,
show inflation rising again.
The loan should shore up the position of Mr Marclio Marques Moreira as
economy minister.
He is to fly to Europe tonight to meet members of the Paris Club of official
creditors, some of which are unhappy about Brazil's continuing moratorium on
its Dollars 20bn Paris Club debt. Since last January, it has been paying
commercial creditors 30 per cent of due interest.
