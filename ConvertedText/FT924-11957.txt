CONTROL Data Systems reported a modest profit for its first quarter as an
independent company. It is the equipment portion of the former Control Data
Corporation, which was split into two companies in May.
Third-quarter net earnings were Dollars 206,000, or 2 cents per share, on
revenue of Dollars 114m. In the same period last year, when the company was
part of Control Data Corporation, net losses were Dollars 2.8m, or 27 cents
per share, on revenues of Dollars 135.7m.
During the 1992 third quarter, Silicon Graphics, a computer workstation
manufacturer, invested Dollars 14.4m in Control Data Systems for
approximately 10 per cent of the common stock of the new company.
For the first nine months of 1992 the company reported revenues of Dollars
363.6m, down from Dollars 424.8m in the same period of 1991. Net losses were
Dollars 144m, including restructuring charges, compared with net losses of
Dollars 15.6m in the first nine months of 1991.
Sun Microsystems reported a big drop in first quarter earnings. The computer
workstation manufacturer said that high component costs for new products had
lowered its profit margins.
Net income for the first quarter was Dollars 4.8m, or 5 cents per share,
compared to Dollars 26.8m, or 27 cents, for the same period a year ago.
Revenues hit a first quarter record of Dollars 855.9m, up more than 13 per
cent from Dollars 754.9m in the first quarter of 1992.
Wall Street analysts had been projecting net earnings of around 22 cents per
share for the quarter.
