FT  21 JUL 94 / International Company News: BankAmerica advances 8%


   By RICHARD WATERS


   NEW YORK


After-tax profits at BankAmerica advanced 8 per cent in the three months to
the end of June, as the fortunes of the San Francisco-based bank continued
to reflect the Californian economy's slow emergence from recession.
Net interest income fell by Dollars 20m to Dollars 1.83bn, as an increase in
loans failed to offset a fall in the bank's net interest margin to 4.49 per
cent from 4.72 per cent. However, provision for credit losses during the
period, at Dollars 125m, was Dollars 102m lower than last time.
Non-interest income, meanwhile, dropped by Dollars 40m to Dollars 1.02m. In
line with other banks and securities houses which have reported results in
recent days, BankAmerica's trading income was affected by the turbulent
financial markets. It fell to Dollars 106m in the latest period from Dollars
172m a year ago. On Tuesday, Merrill Lynch, the US's biggest securities
house, reported net earnings of Dollars 252m, 27 per cent below the Dollars
345m of a year before.
BankAmerica's fees from a number of products - including deposit accounts,
credit cards and trust work - also fell during the period. Higher fees,
particularly from retail customers, have been one of the main methods by
which US banks have increased their non-interest revenues in recent years.
BankAmerica's income, however, was bolstered by a Dollars 65m increase in
other sources of non-interest income, mainly the disposal of assets it had
previously earmarked for sale.
Net income for the three months was Dollars 525m, or Dollars 1.32 per
fully-diluted share, up from Dollars 488m, or Dollars 1.19, the year before.
For the first half as a whole, net income rose to Dollars 1.04bn, or Dollars
2.58 a share, from Dollars 972m, or Dollars 2.38.
