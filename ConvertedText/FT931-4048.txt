FT  12 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Smith & Nephew more than doubled to Pounds
155m - Boost from arthroscopy and wound healing


   By ROLAND RUDD


SMITH & Nephew, the international healthcare and consumer group, reported
pre-tax profits more than doubled from Pounds 70.3m to Pounds 154.6m for
1992.
The rise reflected a strong performance from the arthroscopy and special
wound healing sectors.
The figures have been adjusted for accounting standard FRS 3.
The rise was boosted by the Pounds 40.1m profit on the sale of the Nivea
trademark.
This was partially offset by a Pounds 19m restructuring charge relating to
S&N's withdrawal from UK denim cloth manufacturing.
Turnover improved some 8 per cent, from Pounds 791.7m to Pounds 857.7m,
including a contribution of Pounds 25.8m, against Pounds 42.1m, from
discontinued operations.
Mr John Robinson, chief executive, said: 'We are confident of continuing
real earnings growth through the development of our niche products.'
Wound management, casting bandaging and support, trauma and arthroscopy and
orthopaedic implants divisions generated more than 60 per cent of turnover.
The US now accounts for 42 per cent of sales; UK and continental Europe 40
per cent and 18 per cent in the rest of the world. S&N is to expand its
recently-opened office in Japan, which is already profitable.
Mr Robinson said there were more opportunities to expand overseas, which
could lead to more acquisitions on the high-growth healthcare side.
While healthcare reported a big increase in operating profits, from Pounds
108.1m to Pounds 119.6m, consumer and plastics fell slightly to Pounds 26.4m
(Pounds 26.9m).
Net borrowings fell from Pounds 68m to Pounds 43m, representing gearing of
12 per cent.
Earnings per share rose to 10.2p (4p), compared with an adjusted 9.3p.
A final dividend of 2.82p makes a total of 4.62p (4.44p).
COMMENT
There has always been a question mark over Smith & Nephew's ability to
deliver its promise of real earnings growth. The full year results suggest
that shareholders who remained patient while the company refocused its
strategy are now being rewarded. The core businesses relating to healthcare
account for more than 60 per cent of revenue. Given the demographic trends
there is no reason why demand for the group's high technology and high
margin products, such as artificial joints and key-hole surgery, should not
continue to expand. The increase in US sales cuts both ways: the tax charge
is expected to rise from 29 per cent to 33 per cent, while the new
administration's emphasis on hospital efficiency should boost sales. With
forecast profits of Pounds 175m pre-tax, the shares, up 2 1/4 p to 155 1/2 p
yesterday, are on a prospective multiple of 13.6.  While they remain at a
discount to the market they look good value.
