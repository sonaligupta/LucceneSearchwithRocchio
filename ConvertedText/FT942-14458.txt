FT  20 APR 94 / UK Company News: Go-Ahead pathfinder sets Pounds 4m profit
target


   By ANDREW BOLGER


The Go-Ahead Group, a Gateshead-based bus service operator to be floated
soon with a market value of more than Pounds 40m, has forecast that it will
make operating profits - before exceptional costs - of more than Pounds 4m
for the current financial year.
The pathfinder prospectus, published yesterday, also said operating margins
for the first half to January 1 showed further improvement.
The flotation is by way of a placing with institutions and offer of 5 per
cent of the equity to the 3,500 employees. It is being sponsored by Hill
Samuel, with Panmure Gordon as broker to the issue. Impact day will be next
week.
Go-Ahead plans to focus on urban transport and has recently acquired the
Brighton & Hove Bus and Coach Company and the Oxford Bus Company. The group
operates more than 1,000 buses, with an annualised turnover of more than
Pounds 75m. The proceeds of the placing will be used to repay Pounds 12m of
debt.
Mr Trevor Shears, finance director, said exceptional costs would be about
Pounds 1m, mainly in respect of payments for changing conditions of
employment and redundancies.
