FT  16 DEC 94 / Councils Shake-up: Case Study, Dorest


   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM


In Dorset, the decision to replace the county council with four unitary
authorities has been made in the teeth of opposition from the local business
community, Roland Adburgham writes.
The commission acknowledged that the 'overwhelming preference' of business
people was to have one authority for the Bournemouth conurbation - which
includes Poole and Christchurch - and another for rural Dorset. Instead, it
proposes the conurbation be split into three councils.
The commission did not put forward the two-council option for public
consultation. It argued that a single authority for the urban area would not
take sufficient account of community identities and interests.
Mr Stephen Hall, president of Dorset Chamber of Commerce & Industry, said
yesterday: 'We are deeply disappointed and will make what representations we
can to the secretary of state. The local political issues have been decisive
and the voice of industry has been ignored.'
The commission said 37 per cent of the 42,000 people who made
representations favoured four councils.
