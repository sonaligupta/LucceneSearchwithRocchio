FT  16 DEC 94 / Economic Watch: Swedes, Finns see inflation fall

Sweden and Finland yesterday announced a slight fall in inflation in
November only days after the central banks of both countries raised interest
rates because of fears of an upward swing in inflation next year. The
consumer price index in Sweden rose 2.4 per cent in the year to November,
compared with 2.5 per cent in the year to October. However, the Riksbank
believes tax rises and capacity shortages will lead to a breach of its
target of 3 per cent inflation in 1995. Also yesterday new orders to
industries rose 1.0 per cent in October from September and jumped 17 per
cent compared with October 1993. In Finland, year-on-year core inflation
stood at just 1.1 per cent in November, compared with 1.3 per cent the month
before. This was well within the central bank's target of 2 per cent in
1995.
A 0.2 per cent rise in prices during November kept Spain's year-on-year
headline inflation unchanged at 4.4 per cent. The failure to reduce price
increases will now make it difficult for the government to achieve its
revised year-end headline inflation target of 4.1 per cent.
Registered unemployment in the Netherlands rose to 490,000 in the three
months ended November 30, from 448,000 in the similar period a year earlier.
