FT  16 NOV 93 / International Company News: Kmart falls 22% despite healthy
rise in sales

KMART, the second-largest retailer in the US after Wal-Mart, yesterday
posted a 22.5 per cent decline in third-quarter earnings, despite a 10.5 per
cent increase in sales.
In the 13 weeks to October 27, net income was Dollars 94m, or 20 cents a
share, compared with Dollars 122m, or 27 cents, in the corresponding period
of 1992.
Sales reached a record Dollars 9.77bn, up from Dollars 8.84bn a year
earlier. On a comparable-store basis - excluding outlets opened for less
than a year - sales were up 3 per cent.
The company said the poor profits performance primarily reflected a further
substantial loss by its Pace membership warehouse division. In addition,
income contributed by the PayLess drug-store operation was down 31 per cent.
Although slightly worse than analysts had expected, the 20-cents-a-share
earnings figure did not raise undue concern on Wall Street. This was because
of the company's recent moves to shed the two underperforming businesses.
This month, Kmart agreed to sell 91 of its 113 Pace stores to Wal-Mart. It
also announced plans to close the remainder. Days earlier, a Los Angeles
investment company agreed to buy the PayLess operation for Dollars 1bn.
The retailer said it would take an estimated Dollars 450m charge against
fourth-quarter earnings to cover costs related to the divestments and store
closures.
Compared with a year ago, sales were more heavily weighted toward
lower-priced items. As a result, gross margins slipped to 24.1 per cent,
from 24.2 per cent.
Earnings also suffered from the effect of the 1 per cent increase in the
federal tax rate for corporations, enacted in August.
In the first nine months, net income before an extraordinary item was down
39.2 per cent to Dollars 246m, or 53 cents. Sales were Dollars 29bn, up 10.4
per cent.
