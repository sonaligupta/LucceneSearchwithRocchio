FT  28 MAR 92 / Yeltsin scraps draft constitution


   By LEYLA BOULTON


President Boris Yeltsin is understood to have ditched the official draft
Russian constitution following attempts by parliament's constitutional
committee to reduce his emergency powers, Leyla Boulton reports.
Although a new constitution has been one of Mr Yeltsin's chief political
goals, he has effectively killed the prospect of endowing Russia with a new
one to replace that inherited from the old communist empire at a sitting of
the Russian parliament on April 6.
A constitution not only determines the power structure in Moscow but the
relationship between the centre and the autonomous republics and regions
within the largest republic of the former Soviet Union.
