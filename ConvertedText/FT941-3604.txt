FT  15 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Dilution fears hit Disney


   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and PETER JOHN


A roller coaster ride in Euro Disney ended with shares in the theme park
operator under severe pressure as analysts and investors took fright at the
group's restructuring plan.
The day had started well for the loss-making French group as the refinancing
scheme hammered out with its bankers sent the shares sharply higher in
London and Paris.
Underpinning the rise was the belief that a FFr6bn rights issue would be
issued at slightly below the current share price of around FFr25. However,
at a subsequent meeting with the company the picture changed dramatically.
Shareholders learned that the rights issue - which will more than quadruple
the number of shares to 770m - was to be made at just FFr10.
Euro Disney fell sharply on news of the potential dilution, closing a net 28
off at 390p with turnover approaching 500,000 shares, 10 times its normal
London level. Ms Rebecca Winnington-Ingram at Morgan Stanley said: 'The
dilution is enormous. We continue to believe that the shares are
fundamentally overvalued at current levels.'
A report that the industry-wide hit over the mis-selling of pensions would
be only Pounds 100m, compared with a previous estimate of Pounds 1bn, gave a
lift to life insurers, with Legal & General leading the way. L&G, further
squeezed by a shortage of stock in the market and patchy buying ahead of
figures on Thursday, rose 16 to 483p.
The report, cited in a Sunday newspaper, apparently suggested that only one
person in every 10 who transferred from occupational pensions to personal
plans was expected to claim. The news helped sentiment, although one analyst
pointed out that Refuge, a small life insurer, had made Pounds 11.6m of
provisions for pensions and that figure would probably translate to Pounds
1bn across the board. Refuge closed at 341p ex-dividend.
Oil major British Petroleum moved ahead 8 to 359p as consideration of the
full report and accounts released on Saturday confirmed previous optimism
over cost-cutting and the reserve replacement figures. Hoare Govett pointed
out that although the annual report showed costs were flat in sterling
terms, they were down Pounds 1bn in dollar terms, the currency BP deals in
principally.
Shell Transport was held back by a large line of stock washing around the
market. The shares, which went ex a 15p dividend yesterday, closed unchanged
at 677p after a line of 2m shares was placed in the market at 677p.
Rumours resurfaced that French oil group Elf Aquitaine was poised to sell
its near 10 per cent stake in Enterprise, the oil exploration and production
company. Analysts said the disposal made good sense and would possibly
happen one day, but both companies had denied the speculation, which had
been sparked by a Sunday newspaper report. Enterprise ended 3 up at 414p.
Oversold composite insurers, with big holdings in leading financial markets,
bounced in response to rises on Wall Street, for the Footsie and in US
bonds.
Royal Insurance, regarded as the cheap buy in the sector after
underperforming the All-Share index by 17 per cent over the past three
months, improved 13 to 279p. Commercial Union firmed 5 to 583p and Sun
Alliance appreciated 6 1/2 to 327p.
Insurance broker JIB jumped 19 to 199p after announcing top of the range
profits of Pounds 21.8m and an upbeat statement.
The busy building and construction sectors saw a demerger, several results
and interest rate cut hopes inspire a raft of sharp moves forward.
Figures from English China Clays came in ahead of market forecasts and were
joined by details of the group's plans to spin-off CAMAS, its construction
materials division. The demerger will be by way of a one-for-one share issue
effective on June 1. ECC shares added 13 at 524p. UBS reiterated its buy
stance.
There were results also from Rugby Group, which again came in ahead of
market expectations. They closed 4 up at 328p, additionally helped by the
proposed one-for-one scrip issue. Spring Ram results were in line with
forecasts and this relieved some buyers following the group's recent
chequered history. The shares gained 4 at 67p. Costain put on 2 1/4 at 35
1/2 p following a return to profitability. German interest rate cut hopes
helped Redland rise 12 to 562p.
Restructuring plans at Simon Engineering, including a Pounds 50m rights
issue, were well received and the shares advanced 11 to 117p.
Expectations that the government will soon announce the lifting of the limit
on overseas ownership in Rolls-Royce and British Aerospace boosted both
stocks yesterday. The former moved up 5 to 184p and the latter 8 to 519p.
Analysts expect the government to lift the limit from the prevailing 29.5
per cent to 49.5 per cent.
Nervousness about figures later this month saw Lucas Industries surrender 3
to 212p. TI Group, which disappointed the market last week with the
presentation of its figures, remained in the doldrums. The shares closed at
391p xd.
The market appreciated Cookson Group's Pounds 71.9m disposal of its
engineering businesses to Calder Group. Shares in the industrial materials
group climbed 9 to 285p.
International conglomerate Lonrho gained 5 at 163p on reports that Ashanti
Goldfield, set to be floated this year, will be valued at around Pounds
1.5bn, against earlier predictions of around Pounds 1bn. Lonrho has a 25 per
cent stake in Ashanti. Williams Holdings put on 8 at 403p ahead of today's
results.
Media investment group MAI rose 18 1/2 to 299p after sharply improved
interim profits.
Mirror Group Newspapers added 5 at 190p in anticipation of good figures
today. Saatchi & Saatchi, which is also reporting today, slipped 5 to 142p,
although the stock suffered from receding speculation of a US bidder.
Big turnover in Hillsdown Holdings was thought to have been inspired by a
positive note from James Capel, a delayed reaction to last week's results
and report of directors' share buying. The stock moved forward 4 to 165p,
with turnover touching 10m.
Food retailers were buoyed by weekend press reports of tough talking from
Asda to its suppliers on price and selected brokers continuing to peddle a
positive outlook story. Asda shares edged 1 1/2 ahead to 59 1/2 p. J.
Sainsbury rose 15 1/2 to 376p and Tesco 2 1/2 to 224p.
Renewed doubts over the opening date of the Channel tunnel hit Eurotunnel,
the tunnel's operator. The shares fell 21 to 540p.
A threat of legal action saw Mersey Docks & Harbour dip 14 to 495p.
Encouraging figures from Scotia Holdings, the research-based pharmaceutical
company floated in October, saw the shares advance 10 to 255p.
Coats Viyella improved 11 to 277p ahead of figures scheduled for tomorrow.
