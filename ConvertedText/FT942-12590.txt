FT  28 APR 94 / World Trade News: Argentina may face sanctions


   By JOHN BARHAM


   BUENOS AIRES


Washington has threatened Argentina with trade sanctions unless it
introduces intellectual property protection laws, stalled in Argentina's
Congress since 1991.
Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, told Mr Domingo Cavallo,
Argentina's economy minister, who was on an official visit to Washington,
that he would place Argentina on a US government priority list. This would
lead to investigations into whether Argentina's laws damaged US companies,
particularly pharmaceutical laboratories. If this was confirmed, Washington
would impose trade sanctions.
Argentina's pharmaceuticals market has annual sales of Dollars 3bn and has
grown rapidly in the past three years. Piracy of multinational companies'
products has been estimated at Dollars 500m-Dollars 900m a year.
However, Mr Cavallo said the threat was 'irrelevant and unilateral' and said
Argentina would appeal against US measures to a panel of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
He added that Argentina would introduce legislation to conform to new
intellectual property rules included in the Gatt's Uruguay Round.
Developing countries have a four-year grace period to bring their laws into
line with new international minimum standards.
The government has failed to convince Congress to approve a bill first
introduced in 1991 to replace its existing 1864 patent legislation. US
officials claim that Congress has not passed the law because the government
has not given it a high priority.
Local laboratories claim the new laws would raise drug prices and accused
the US of 'extortion'.
