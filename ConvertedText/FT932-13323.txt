FT  23 APR 93 / International Company News: Seven-Eleven Japan advances


   By CHARLES LEADBEATER


   TOKYO


SEVEN-Eleven Japan, the country's largest convenience store operator,
yesterday reported a 9.7 per cent increase in pre-tax profits, one of the
best financial performances this year by a leading retailer.
While most Japanese retailers, especially luxury department stores, have
been hit hard by the downturn in consumer spending, Seven-Eleven announced
increases in its profits, sales and dividends.
Seven-Eleven runs an extensive network of 24-hour, local convenience stores,
which sell food and household items. The contrast between its improved
financial performance and the sharp deterioration in the performance of
leading department stores is an indicator of how consumer spending is
shifting from luxury brands to basic goods.
The group's pre-tax profit rose by 9.7 per cent to Y85,160m (Dollars 767m)
for the year to the end of February on overall sales growth of 11.8 per cent
to Y181,962m. The company said it was increasing its final dividend by Y0.5
per share to Y34, up Y2 from last year.
Denny's Japan, the fast-food restaurant chain, reported a 19.1 per cent fall
in pre-tax profits in the year to the end of February, largely because lower
interest rates lowered its non-operating income and it had fewer customers.
Denny's pre-tax profits were Y6.46bn, compared with Y7.99bn in the previous
year. Sales rose by 0.6 per cent to Y85.48bn, from Y85bn the year before.
Both Seven-Eleven and Denny's are affiliated with Ito-Yokado, Japan's
largest supermarket operator. The slump in the Japanese economy was the main
factor behind Ito-Yokado reporting its first ever fall in consolidated
pre-tax profits.
Ito-Yokado, said consolidated pre-tax profit, covering the parent group and
58 subsidiaries, for the year to the end of February, was 11.1 per cent down
at Y181,121m. The parent company's unconsolidated pre-tax profit rose by 0.4
per cent to Y97.51bn on sales of Y1,511.55bn, up 3.6 per cent on the year
before.
Tokyu, the Tokyo-based supermarket and chain store operator, reported a 14.2
per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y4.93bn, on sales which were 2.2 per
cent up at Y291.32bn. Taka-Q, the clothing manufacturer, reported a loss of
Y4.27bn in the year to February 28. Sales fell by 12.5 per cent to Y74.69bn.
