FT  10 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei rises on late
index-linked buying


   By NEIL WEINBERG


   TOKYO


INDEX-RELATED buying linked to the expiration of January options prompted a
rebound in the Nikkei average in the final hour of trading, writes Neil
Weinberg in Tokyo.
The Nikkei closed 398.64 up at 23,113.64. The finish was just off the day's
high of 23,114.54 while the low was 22,544.34. First section volume slipped
to 170m shares from 192m.
Although the Nikkei was higher, declines led advances by 479 to 459, with
162 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks gained
6.02 to 1,699.41 but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index lost 5.89 at
1,277.32.
The market saw early bargain hunting after Wednesday's 3.6 per cent Nikkei
drop, but it retreated later on a fall in stock index futures prices. The
Nikkei then surged 372 points in the last hour on arbitrage-related buying.
Automakers, banks and brokerages were among the day's losers. Honda weakened
Y60 to Y1,420 on a downward revision of its earnings forecast for the year
to end-March, while Industrial Bank of Japan declined Y110 to Y3,100.
On the positive side were credit and leasing companies, food groups and
insurers. Ajinomoto rose Y30 to Y1,420 and Tokio Marine Y30 to Y1,300.
Many of the factors which have supported share prices in recent sessions,
including the yen's gains against the dollar and lower interest rates, have
been discounted and investors are now biding their time in the absence of
fresh news, dealers said.
In view of the market's lack of direction, there was relatively heavy
trading in smaller capitalised issues and speculative shares. Nippon Piston
Ring, a component in the Nikkei average, climbed Y100 to Y766 and Nippon
Carbon Y140 to Y2,070 on strong turnover.
In Osaka, the OSE average dipped 84.91 to 24,031.66 on volume of 26.4m
shares. Ono Pharmaceutical fell Y120 to Y4,720.
Roundup
TRADING IN the rest of the region was mostly light, influenced by local
factors.
TAIWAN finished higher, spurred by the central bank's widely expected cut in
its rediscount rate. The weighted index closed 30.90 ahead at 4,803.51.
Turnover was TDollars 38.4bn, against TDollars 42.2bn.
HONG KONG closed marginally lower. The Hang Seng index eased 3.13 to finish
at 4,334. Turnover contracted to HKDollars 1.44bn, from HKDollars 1.66bn.
China Light moved forward 60 cents to HKDollars 24.10 on news of an
agreement with the government to allow it to report some of its profits from
electricity sales to China.
SEOUL recovered from early weakness to close higher. The composite stock
index added 11.26 at 637.11 on turnover of Won340bn.
Listed subsidiaries of the Hyundai Group fell by their daily limits for the
third successive day, because of lingering worries over credit. The group
and its main banker have denied rumours that it is facing a politically
motivated credit freeze.
AUSTRALIA ended slightly easier. The All Ordinaries index softened 1.4 to
1662.0. Newly listed West Australian Newspapers closed at ADollars 1.70, a
70 per cent premium to the offer price. It also topped the volume list with
more than 15.3m shares traded. A total of 113.4m shares worth ADollars
244.6m changed hands.
MANILA consolidated for the second day after recent upward moves. The
composite index receded 19.30 to 1,208.09. The index set a 25-month high of
1,241.48 on Tuesday.
NEW ZEALAND rose modestly, but low turnover exaggerated price gains. The
NZSE-40 Index ended 9.23 firmer at 1,519.56.
Fay, Richwhite & Co rose 10 cents to 92 cents. The stock has climbed 51 per
cent in the last six sessions. Interest in the stock appeared to be linked
to publicity surrounding New Zealand's challenge for the America's Cup
yachting contest, starting soon in California. Sir Michael Fay, one of the
partners of a controlling stake in Fay Richwhite, heads the consortium
challenging for the Cup.
BANGKOK was supported by aggressive buying of Bangkok Bank shares, which
jumped Bt34 to Bt520, with Bt1.19bn worth changing hands, one-quarter of
turnover. The SET index put on 1.74 to 725.70 in turnover of Bt4.19bn.
