FT  26 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Brake Bros makes biggest buy


   By PETER PEARSE


BRAKE BROS, the supplier of frozen and chilled foods to the catering trade,
has acquired Country Choice Foods (Group), a supplier of frozen bakery
products, for up to Pounds 14m, its biggest acquisition to date.
The initial consideration is Pounds 10m to be met by the allotment of 2.06m
new shares. Further consideration, up to Pounds 4m, depends on CCF's trading
results for the year to February 28. It will be satisfied either by the
issue of five-year loan notes or the allotment of up to 1m shares, or by a
combination of both.
Mr Frank Brake, managing director, said although CCF related to Brake's
existing businesses, it was 'another niche' for Brake which is especially
strong in seafood, fish, prepared meats and poultry products. It will
continue as a stand-alone operation, he said. There would be no
rationalisation or closures as a result of the acquisition, though there
would be synergies on the buying side.
CCF is based in Orpington, Kent, while Brake is just along the motorway at
Ashford.
CCF operates from eight depots across the UK, made pre-tax profits of Pounds
1.55m in the year to February 1993 on turnover of Pounds 40m, and at its
year-end had net assets of Pounds 1.39m. It is headed by Mr Ken Manley as
chairman and his brother Stephen as managing director. Both will remain at
CCF, as will its other directors. Mr Ken Manley will become a non-executive
director of Brake.
