FT  28 APR 94 / People: From one privatisation to another


AEA Technology, the newly created arm of the Atomic Energy Authority which
is to be privatised later this year, has its first chief executive.
He is to be Peter Watson, the British Rail main board director for
engineering. Before joining BR in 1991, Watson spent most of his career at
GKN, the engineering group, where he rose to be head of research and
development, and ran two operating divisions.
Watson, 50, was selected because of his combined experience of science and
business, as well as his knowledge of both public and private sector
companies.
According to Sir Anthony Cleaver, AEA chairman, 'We have a unique
opportunity to create for Britain a flagship science and engineering
services company, and we needed someone with the right credentials to help
realise that vision.' Meanwhile, Watson believes that AEA is capable of
'being a leader in the world' as a provider of high technology services.
Though the sale of AEA Technology is expected to realise about Pounds 200m,
decisions have still to be taken on the form of its privatisation.
