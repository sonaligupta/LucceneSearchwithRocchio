FT  20 APR 94 / Ashanti valued at Dollars 1.7bn: Shares priced at
top-of-the-range Dollars 20 and move to 3% premium


   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent


Shares in Ashanti Goldfields of Ghana, which owns one of the world's great
gold mines, were priced at Dollars 20 yesterday, at the top of the Dollars
17 to Dollars 20 range indicated in the March prospectus.
In conditional dealing, which started in London yesterday afternoon, the
shares immediately went to a premium of 60 cents, or 3 per cent, showing how
precisely the price had been fixed by Ashanti and its advisers James Capel
and Morgan Grenfell. Shortly after the market closed the shares were trading
at between Dollars 20.85 and Dollars 21.
At Dollars 20 a share, Ashanti is valued at Dollars 1.67bn. The Ghanaian
government, which sold shares to reduce its holding from 55 per cent to 31.3
per cent, will collect Dollars 316m. Ashanti, which issued new shares, will
bank Dollars 57m.
The price values the 43 per cent Ashanti stake owned by Lonrho, the UK-based
conglomerate, at about Dollars 720m - five times its present book value of
Pounds 90m. Lonrho's shares have risen strongly as the likely success of the
Ashanti offer became clear and they closed unchanged yesterday at 154p.
In spite of gold's lacklustre price performance, applications were received
for more than 100m Ashanti shares compared with the 20.2m offered globally.
This followed an international 'roadshow' which included more than 100
interviews in three weeks. The UK, North America and the rest of the world
each accounted for about a third of the applications.
James Capel, the 'global bookrunner', said each of the five international
syndicate managers would receive roughly the same number of shares. The
managers would consider the quality of the institutional investors, as well
as the quantity of shares they asked for, before deciding on the final
distribution. 'We want the biggest spread of high-quality, long-term
investors we can get.'
Of the 21.4m shares on offer, 17.9m are being sold by the Ghanaian
government and issued by Ashanti. Some 4m shares have been reserved for
Ghanaian investors. Unconditional dealings in London are planned to start on
April 26 when Ashanti will be included in the new Financial Times Gold Mines
Index.
