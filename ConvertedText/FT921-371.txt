FT  30 MAR 92 / Election 1992: The floating voter


In pursuit of the floating voter: Kate Phillips, the Labour candidate for
Stirling, took to the water yesterday to follow part of her campaign trail
by canoe. The constituency, where Michael Forsyth is defending a majority of
just 548, will provide one of the closest fights in the general election.
Labour will be keen to unseat one of Scotland's most prominent
Conservatives, while Margaret Thatcher has been out campaigning for her
former Scottish Office minister
