FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Gold Greenlees shows 19% advance to Pounds
2.66m


   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent


Gold Greenlees Trott, the advertising and marketing services group, reported
pre-tax profits up 19 per cent from Pounds 2.24m to Pounds 2.66m in the six
months to October 31.
Turnover increased 13 per cent from Pounds 127.8m to Pounds 143.8m and group
revenue grew 9 per cent from Pounds 25.8m to Pounds 28m. Operating profits
rose by 11 per cent to Pounds 3.16m.
Earnings per share were up from 6.2p to 7.16p. The interim dividend is 2p
(3.3p) with the balance of interim and final adjusted to reflect the group's
previous practice.
Net interest costs fell by 18 per cent to Pounds 507,000, reflecting reduced
long-term borrowings.
The results represented the best overall performance for some time, said Mr
Michael Greenlees, chairman. This was largely achieved as a result of
improvements in UK oper-ations, in particular of GGT Direct and GGT
Advertising.
