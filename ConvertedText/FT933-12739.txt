FT  22 JUL 93 / International Company News: Defence weakens Israeli state
sector

   JERUSALEM


ISRAEL yesterday announced results for its state-owned sector and gave an
indication of the progress of the privatisation programme.
State companies lost Shk220.3m (Dollars 78.6m) last year following a
combined loss of Shk1bn by Israel Aircraft Industries and Israel Military
Industries. But companies in which the government has sold partial stakes -
such as Bezeq, the communications monopoly, and Israel Chemicals - increased
profits.
'The four utilities - electricity, water, transportation and
telecommunications - are in an expansion phase, while defence activity is
shrinking,' said Mr Yossi Nitzani, director of the Government Companies
Authority.
Excluding the defence industries, state-controlled companies showed a profit
of Shk801m, a 13 per cent increase over 1991. Bezeq announced profits of
Shk207.4m, up from Shk186.5m in 1991. Israel Electric overturned its 1991
loss of Shk79.4m to post profits of Shk184m, while Israel Chemicals improved
profits to Shk180.9m from Shk171.6m.
Mr Nitzani said that during the first five months of this year the
government sold Dollars 615.8m worth of companies, compared with total
divestment last year of Dollars 632.6m.
