FT  12 MAR 92 / Alliance & Leicester profits hurt by commercial loan losses


   By DAVID BARCHARD


HEAVY losses on commercial lending helped halve 1991 pre-tax profits at
Alliance & Leicester, the third largest UK building society.
Its performance - pre-tax profits of Pounds 99.5m for the year to December
31 were down from Pounds 198.6m - is likely to be the worst of any leading
building society, with the possible exception of Nationwide.
Mr Peter White, the society's new chief executive, said yesterday he had
drawn up a three-year reconstruction plan following the results, which he
said were disappointing.
'We have made realistic provisions and we are now emphasising the quality of
our lending and building up balance sheet strength and containing our costs,
and look forward to renewed profit growth in 1992,' Mr White said.
Prospects of Alliance & Leicester following Abbey National to the market
with a flotation have had to be deferred indefinitely. Until these results,
it seemed likely the society would be floated on the stock exchange within
two years.
There was a Pounds 215m charge for bad debts. Of this, Pounds 140m came from
commercial lending to hotels, nursing homes, and house building operations.
Total provisions were Pounds 251.6m at the end of the year, up from Pounds
104.4m.
The society withdrew from new lending to this sector more than a year ago
and commercial lending now makes up only 4.5 per cent of its portfolio,
compared with 6.3 per cent a year ago.
Residential mortgage business shrank by 17 per cent from Pounds 3.3bn in
1990 to Pounds 2.74bn. The society's 95-branch estate agency operation lost
Pounds 7.8m, down from losses of Pounds 9.7m in 1990.
Girobank, the banking arm of the Post Office which the society bought two
years ago, contributed profits of Pounds 48.8m but this included exceptional
profits of Pounds 9m from reduced expenses and Pounds 4m from the sale of
its gilt portfolio.
