FT  19 MAY 92 / Manchester submits Olympic proposals


   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent


ORGANISERS of Manchester's bid to host the 2000 Olympic Games submitted
outline plans yesterday for the proposed facilities and said the development
would create up to 3,500 permanent jobs.
According to the organisers, the contract to run the main Olympic sites has
drawn interest from Manchester United Football Club, Wembley Stadium and
Spectacor, a US sports management group.
Outline plans were submitted for a stadium, a cycle track, a national sports
training centre and nearby retail and commercial development. Formal
consultations will now start with about 50 businesses that will be displaced
by the plans. Financial packages to help them are being prepared by
Co-operative Bank.
The aim is to get early planning permission so that construction of at least
the Pounds 9m cycle track is well under way when members of the
International Olympic Committee (IOC) visit the city next year.
By then, the site of the stadium should be ready for construction to start.
The size of the stadium will depend on the IOC decision - 80,000 seats if
Manchester is chosen, 60,000 if not. It is expected to cost Pounds 100m to
Pounds 120m.
The government, which gave Pounds 53m towards the bid in February, still has
to be persuaded to back a national stadium if Manchester fails to get the
Olympics. Mr Bob Scott, chairman of the bid, said: 'As things stand, the
stadium will only be built if the games are awarded, but we hope to persuade
the government to adopt a more positive view in the coming months.'
