FT  06 JUN 92 / EC soyabean proposal


   By NANCY DUNNE


   WASHINGTON


The European Community is proposing to negotiate compensation for the US -
as well as for Argentina and Brazil - for the loss of soyabean sales as a
result of European oilseeds subsidies, the EC Commission in Brussels said
yesterday, writes Nancy Dunne in Washington. The compensation offer is
likely to be in the form of tariff reductions on EC imports.
