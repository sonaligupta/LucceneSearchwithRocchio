FT  24 NOV 92 / Sri Lankans must register

The Sri Lankan government has passed an emergency law requiring citizens to
register with police after recent attacks by Tamil separatists and
intelligence warnings of more to come, AP reports from Colombo.
The residency law also requires Sri Lankans to seek police permission before
allowing guests to stay in their homes, the president's office said.
Householders must register everyone living at each home and must tell police
if anyone moves out.
Rebels from the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam have fought for an
independent homeland in the north and east since 1983. More than 17,000
people have been killed.
On November 16, a Tamil suicide bomber assassinated Sri Lanka's navy
commander, Clancy Fernando, in Colombo.
Tamils make up 18 per cent of Sri Lanka's 17m people.
