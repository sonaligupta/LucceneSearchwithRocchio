FT  13 MAR 92 / Inflation gloom for Spain's planners


   By TOM BURNS


SPAIN'S economic planners, who have identified inflation as the chief hurdle
to convergence with the EC's leading economies, suffered a setback yesterday
when the February consumer price index (CPI) showed a 0.7 per cent jump,
writes Tom Burns. This took the accumulated CPI increase this year to 2.2
per cent and lifted year-on-year inflation to 6.8 per cent. The increase
last month was well above predictions. Analysts had expected a rise of
O1-0.3 per cent.
The increase will force the government to revise its target of a 5 per cent
price rise by the end of this year. It is also likely to delay indefinitely
any reduction in interest rates and it will fuel union demands to seek large
pay increases in the annual spring round.
Analysts said that raised excise duties and value added tax levels which
were introduced at the begining of the year had fed through into the
February figures. Shares on the Madrid stock market index fell by just over
four points in early trading but rallied slightly to end the day at 260.77,
down 2.46 points.
