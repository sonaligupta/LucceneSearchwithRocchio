FT  25 AUG 92 / Research body to probe diet habits: British Association for
the Advancement of Science


   By CLIVE COOKSON


THE ECONOMIC and Social Research Council is to carry out a Pounds 1.4m
investigation of the nation's diet to discover why the British choose to eat
what they do.
A pilot study for the programme, launched at the meeting, suggested that bad
eating habits among children may be broken more easily than previously
imagined.
Professor Fergus Lowe and colleagues at the University of Wales convinced a
group of six-year-olds to eat vegetables they previously would not touch  -
such as broccoli  - by showing a video in which the broccoli-loving Food
Dudes triumph over General Junk and his Junk Junta.
The researchers now believe that children's dislike of certain foods is
normally 'not very deep-seated, not biological or personality based'.
Combinations of pesticides could form lethal cocktails, endangering
wildlife. Dr Colin Walker, of Reading University's zoology department, said
some mixtures of chemicals had a combined action more potent than the sum of
the effects of the components.
