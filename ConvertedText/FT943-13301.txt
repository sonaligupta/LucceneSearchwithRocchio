FT  20 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Grosvenor Dev net asset value at 155.9p


Grosvenor Development Capital, a venture capital investment trust, reported
a net asset value, fully diluted, of 155.9p per share at June 30.
The figure represented a modest appreciation on the value of 153.8p a year
earlier.
Mr David Bucks, chairman, said the acquisition in February of Grosvenor
Venture Managers by Mercury Asset Management had enabled the company to
participate in larger transactions. Investments made during the half year
amounted to Pounds 2.3m, including Pounds 1.77m in three new companies -
Castle Corporation, Creos International and Vero Electronics.
Realisations totalled Pounds 900,000 and included the sale of part of the
holding in Chiroscience and further reductions in its holding in Vega.
Losses per share for the first half showed little change at 1.89p (1.91p);
directors said the single distribution for the year was unlikely to be below
last year's 1.1p.
