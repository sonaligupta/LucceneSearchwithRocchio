FT  29 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Clarke Hooper starts to show improvement


   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent


CLARKE HOOPER, the international marketing services group, saw its pre-tax
profits fall sharply in the six months to October 31 1991, but improve over
the the previous year's second half.
Profit came out at Pounds 820,000 (Pounds 1.73m), generated on turnover down
Pounds 4m to Pounds 23.7m.
Mr Barry Clarke, chairman, said action had been taken to cut overheads by
some Pounds 2m. The reduced cost base had helped to improve profitability
substantially, the half year outcome comparing with Pounds 326,000 in the
second part of last year.
'We are now in a better position to start integrating resources and have the
opportunity to focus on the fixed costs of our business,' he said. One
cost-cutting measure was the integration of three Toronto offices into one
unit.
Mr Clarke said it was decided to maintain the interim dividend at 1.7p but
he remained cautious about prospects.
Earnings per share were cut to 2.8p (7.1p) in the period on capital
increased by last June's placing and open offer.
The chairman reported that several parts of the group were currently
'bucking the trend' of poor performance in the sector.
But he warned that 1992 was unlikely to see much improvement for the
advertising and marketing businesses.
