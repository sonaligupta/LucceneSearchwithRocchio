FT  27 JUL 92 / International Company News: SIA set to make bonus issue


   By REUTER


   SINGAPORE


SINGAPORE Airlines (SIA), the flag carrier, proposed a one-for-one bonus
issue at its annual meeting on Saturday, Reuter reports from Singapore.
The airline hopes the move will help its shares climb out of the narrow
range of SDollars 12 to SDollars 13 each, which they have traded at since
the end of the Gulf war in February 1991.
SIA's shareholding structure restricts trading: about 100 shareholders
control 91.6 per cent of the airline. Local analysts said a bonus issue
would make SIA shares more liquid. With more shares available for trading,
prices could be expected to rise.
pany. SIA is among the world's most profitable airlines.
