FT933-9974

FT  06 AUG 93 / Observer: Bonus time


It will take more than a big miscalculation of the UK balance of payments
figures to trip up the slick-willies at the new-look Central Statistical
Office. Far from being embarrassed at the size of the Pounds 2.9bn downwards
revision to the provisional estimate for last year's current account
deficit, the CSO was glowing with pride at the tininess of its 'balancing
item'.
This is the euphemistic name given by statisticians to what is otherwise
known as the black hole - the difference between the current and capital
accounts which in theory, but rarely in practice, add up. Last year there
was only Pounds 301m in the black hole, compared with Pounds 7.3bn in 1990 -
the smallest figure since 1975. So no more rude suggestions, please, that
CSO boss Bill Maclennan may have failed to meet his performance targets.
