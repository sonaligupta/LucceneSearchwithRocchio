FT  03 SEP 93 / International Company News: Aran Energy jumps to IPounds
3.29m


From turnover ahead from IPounds 14.2m to IPounds 31.16m (Pounds 29.3m),
Aran Energy, the Dublin-based oil and gas exploration concern, boosted
pre-tax profits from IPounds 38,000 to IPounds 3.29m for the six months to
June 30.
After tax totalling IPounds 759,000 compared with IPounds 164,000 earnings
per share were 0.97p against losses of 0.05p.
Directors explained that the 'much-improved results reflected the group's
increased level of oil and gas production, arising mainly from the
acquisition of an interest in the Dunlin oil field'. This continued to
perform satisfactorily, they added, with the group's 26 per cent share of
production averaging 6,739 barrels per day during the period.
