FT  25 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Car sales hit Pendragon


   By ANGUS FOSTER


PENDRAGON, the luxury and executive car dealer, yesterday announced a fall,
from Pounds 5.07m to Pounds 4.73m, in pre-tax profits for the year to
December 31, reflecting reduced contributions from new car sales and the
contract hire business.
But Mr Trevor Finn, chief executive, said the company's used car sales and
after-sales division performed well as customers delayed new purchases.
Following the 5 per cent reduction in new car tax announced in the budget,
and with the uncertainty of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report
removed, Mr Finn anticipated an improvement in new car sales from August and
said the outlook was promising.
Turnover fell to Pounds 168.3m (Pounds 174.4m). Operating profits were
dragged lower by higher administrative expenses, reflecting increased costs
managing franchises acquired during the year. Interest charges dropped to
Pounds 830,000 (Pounds 2.18m), helped by the proceeds of last June's Pounds
11m rights issue.
The company held net cash of some Pounds 2.1m at the year end.
More shares in issue pushed earnings down to 12.1p (15.1p). However, the
directors are recommending a final dividend of 4p to make a total of 6p, an
11 per cent increase.
Mr Finn said although used car volumes were down, margins improved. This was
because consumers delayed new purchases, leading to a shortage of low
mileage used cars on the market.
