FT  26 OCT 92 / Italy's banks begin to breaktheir bonds: The promise of
privatisation is nurturing bigger, more efficient groups


   By HAIG SIMONIAN


WITHDRAW money from an Italian bank machine, and your account will be
debited the day before the transaction took place. Make a deposit, and,
until recently, you would not be credited until tomorrow.
Restrictive practices, inefficiency and poor service are the hallmarks of
Italian banking, which has been slower to reform than any other in Europe.
Generous margins between interest rates for loans and deposits have
cushioned banks from overmanning and poor management, while public-sector
ownership has allowed many to operate in a vacuum from free market
competition.
Now privatisation, a priority for the Amato government, promises to release
banks from the bonds of politicians, who have sometimes fostered cronyism
and uncommercial lending. Also, more liberal policies towards takeovers and
branch expansion by the Bank of Italy are nurturing fewer, bigger and more
efficient banks.
The past year has seen the emergence of two big banking groups in Rome and
Turin, with early signs of a third in Milan.
Banca di Roma, Italy's biggest bank in terms of branches, was formed in
August from the merger of Banco di Roma with Banco di Santo Spirito. The
latter had already been bought by the Cassa di Risparmio di Roma, the Rome
savings bank, whose managing director, Mr Cesare Geronzi, is a leading
reformer.
In Turin, Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino became Italy's largest bank
in terms of assets last year with the L2,100bn (Dollars 1.57bn) acquisition
of a 50 per cent stake in Crediop, the Treasury-owned long-term lending
institution, in which it already had a 40 per cent holding.
A third big banking force could take shape should Cariplo, Italy's biggest
savings bank, succeed in buying a large slice of Istituto Mobiliare Italiano
(IMI), the big, Treasury-controlled investment and financial services group.
Though blocked for more than a year by party political differences, the
Amato government's need for privatisation income should push the deal ahead.
A fourth big financial services group could be formed around Credito
Italiano, Italy's sixth-biggest bank, controlled by the IRI state holding
company and soon to be privatised. Among potential buyers is Generali,
Italy's biggest and most liquid insurance group, which last year raised
L1,750bn from shareholders for future acquisitions. Buying Credito Italiano
would combine its pre-eminence in insurance with a leading role in finance,
Privatisation is forcing the pace of change. The sale of Credito Italiano is
the boldest step in a gradual process which began with the L1,250bn
flotation in January of an opening 20 per cent stake in San Paolo. Private
shareholders have also gained greater representation in Banca di Roma via a
complex convertible bond issued by Banco di Santo Spirito when it merged
with the Rome savings bank.
Privatisation should make the banks more responsive to the market, and also
provide funds for the expansion possible under more liberal branching rules.
Credito Italiano's network has risen by 150 branches to more than 720 in the
past three years, San Paolo plans to open 80 branches this year. But none of
Italy's big banks has the nationwide coverage offered by their French or UK
counterparts.
Extra funds will help the big banks taking shape to expand abroad. So far,
only San Paolo, and, to a lesser extent, Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI),
have sizeable foreign operations.
Greater size will help banks fight off competition from foreign rivals at
home under the European Community's liberalised banking rules. So far, the
expected push by foreign banks into Italy, lured by fat margins, has been
limited by the scarcity of takeover candidates and high prices for the banks
on offer. Only Deutsche Bank, which owns the 130-branch Banca d'America e
d'Italia, and Credit Lyonnais, which controls the 145-branch Credito
Bergamasco, are present in force.
But the foreigners want to grow. Credit Agricole, the big French bank and
one of five members of the shareholders' pact controlling Banco Ambrosiano
Veneto (Ambroveneto), Italy's largest private-sector bank, looks poised to
raise its presence.
With two Ambroveneto shareholders planning to sell out, the French would
like to double their holding to 25 per cent, subject to approval from the
central bank and Ambroveneto's chairman. That may be a cautious step towards
an eventual bid, required for any shareholder exceeding 29 per cent.
Two, very different, institutions, have been left isolated. BCI, once
Italy's most prestigious bank on the basis of size and international
representation, has been eclipsed by newcomers like San Paolo and Banca di
Roma.
It was widely expected that BCI, rather than Credito Italiano, would top the
government's privatisation list. The fact that its fate remains unsettled
has spurred speculation that it may be destined for a politically ordained
merger with Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL), the big, but disgraced,
Treasury-owned bank implicated in improper lending to Iraq.
Publicly, BCI's management views a merger as anathema. In private, however,
executives are not loath to a deal, subject to guarantees they will be in
charge and further skeletons in BNL's cupboard will be the government's
responsibility.
The rationalisation leaves Banco di Napoli, Banco di Sicilia and Banco di
Sardegna, three publicly owned banks from southern Italy, in search of
partners. And Banca Nazionale dell'Agricoltura, until recently the biggest
private-sector bank, faces an uphill task preserving its independence on the
back of poor profits and management.
Rationalisation will be required among provincial savings banks. Some have
joined forces, while others have brought in outside shareholders, often the
big banks. But the pace must be accelerated if Italy is to gain a banking
sector commensurate with its industrial base.
