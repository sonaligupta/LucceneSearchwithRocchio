FT  12 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Eurocamp shares tumble 65p


   By MAGGIE URRY


EUROCAMP, the camping holiday group, yesterday warned that UK bookings for
the summer season were 20 per cent down on this time last year. The shares
fell 65p to 259p.
Mr Tom Neville, chairman, told shareholders at the annual meeting that
Eurocamp was now planning on strong late bookings and 'could still achieve a
final profits figure only a little below that recorded in 1992'.
Pre-tax profits were Pounds 9.4m in the year to October 31.
However, he warned that without this improvement in booking volumes, 'a
somewhat larger reduction in profits could arise'.
Mr Neville said low consumer confidence had depressed the market. The
pound's fall against the French franc had affected demand for Eurocamp's
holidays which are mainly in France.
Bookings from customers in the Netherlands and Germany had been
disappointing since the new year, he said, with Dutch bookings flat and
German bookings up 5 per cent.
Mr Richard Atkinson, managing director, said it was premature to talk about
the current year dividend, which totalled 9.75p last year.
He said the group aimed to achieve occupancy rates similar to last year's
level, with some adjustment to capacity.
There would be some squeeze on margins, although a lot of Eurocamp's costs
varied with numbers of holidays sold.
