FT  04 AUG 92 / Observer: Searching


What price Companies House? Now that the annual report of the government's
central corporate information service is in the public domain it is worth
doing a few sums to see what Board of Trade President Michael Heseltine
might get if he decides to privatise the 1,150-strong executive agency.
Valuing it at 15 times the operating surplus, for example, would make it
worth Pounds 23.5m, which is virtually identical to the value of the fixed
assets. However, no attempt has been made to value its huge historical
database on all public and private companies. This is what makes Companies
House such a plum asset for the right sort of buyer.
However, Dun & Bradstreet, one of the obvious contenders, says,
appropriately enough, that it needs more information before expressing an
opinion.
If it wastes too much time searching for information it might miss its
prize.
