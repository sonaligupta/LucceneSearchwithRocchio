AACHENER und Muenchener Versicherung, the non-life arm of German insurance
group Aachener und Muenchener Beteiligungs, said it would pay a DM5 dividend
in addition to an unchanged DM10 dividend on 1991 results, Reuter reports
from Frankfurt.
AMV said that the company wanted to reward shareholders from extraordinary
income it received in 1991 linked to the sale of its Badenia shares package
to the parent.
