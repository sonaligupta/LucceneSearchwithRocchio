FT  27 JAN 94 / Savings levels gain ground


   By ALAN PIKE


Household saving as a proportion of disposable income - which was negative
between 1986 and 1989 - reached 4.8 per cent in 1992, Alan Pike writes.
Consumer credit, which peaked at nearly Pounds 2bn in the third quarter of
1988 before falling to Pounds 60m in the second quarter of 1992, had climbed
back to Pounds 700m by the third quarter of last year.
