FT  05 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Hotels optimism


   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and ZHANG TINGTING


Another busy day's turnover in hotel stocks was testimony to the current
debate among market analysts over the timing and rate of recovery in the
maligned sector. Kleinwort Benson, in its half-yearly review of the hotel
market, published yesterday, said enthusiasm for recovery prospects was now
overriding the suspicions engendered by the suspensions earlier this year of
Queens Moat Houses and Resort Hotels.
The securities house raised its forecast of room demand at UK hotels this
year to 8 per cent, although it admits that room yield is likely to be flat.
However, 1994 will bring room yield and trading profit per room up by 5 per
cent, Kleinwort believes.
Yesterday, Forte, tipped by a number of brokers as a prime beneficiary of
the sector's potential upturn, saw its shares improve 3 to 216p in brisk
turnover of 3.6m. Ladbroke again attracted attention because of its high
yield in the face of continued talk of UK base rate cuts. Dealers reported
switching between the stock and Forte. The shares ended a penny ahead at
198p after a volatile session which saw a hefty 8m traded.
There was also speculation in the market that the financial problems at
Queens Moat Houses, Britain's second biggest hotel group whose shares were
suspended in March, may be worse than earlier reports had suggested.
Industry sources say that initial estimates of shareholder funds show a fall
from Pounds 1bn to just Pounds 250m. One hotel analyst calculated that the
implications of this for shareholders would be a share price of under 10p.
The shares were suspended at 47p. There had been hopes that the group's
residual value pointed to a price above 20p.
