FT  21 DEC 92 / The European Market: Schengen old guard faces change with
trepidation - Open borders threaten Luxembourg village's way of life


   By ANDREW HILL


THE border post on the bridge over the Moselle river at Schengen is locked,
but is not yet empty.
Inside, Mr Rene Zimmer, the Luxembourg village's last customs and
immigration chief, is poring over the new European Community VAT
regulations.
These are the rules which in a few days should open the frontier and close
the border post for good, sending Mr Zimmer, 57, to a well-earned
pre-retirement posting in Esch-sur-Alzette, further west.
Mr Zimmer is pleased. He has spent 17 of the last 25 years manning the
frontier with Germany and France, but he is not a Schengen man.
Esch-sur-Alzette is closer to his home.
In the Cafe International, however, opposite the bridge, proprietor Ernest
Schemel, 73, his son Guy and a handful of Schengen's 350 locals believe the
single market will bring trouble. They see more crime, more bureaucracy,
more uncertainty and, at worst, redundancy for those villagers who for years
have made their living from the frontier.
That Schengen, squeezed into the south-eastern corner of Luxembourg, should
fear the lifting of border controls is ironic.
It was at Schengen - or, more accurately, in a boat moored beneath the
bridge - that France, Germany and the Benelux countries signed the Schengen
agreement in June 1990 which was supposed to herald the barrier-free
Community.
The five countries, now swollen to nine, committed themselves to moving
ahead of the rest of the EC by lifting controls on people by January 1 1993.
Only Britain, Denmark and Ireland have not signed.
The agreement has already taken effect in Schengen itself. Regular frontier
controls on the Luxembourg side of the Moselle disappeared earlier this
year. In Germany and France a handful of uniformed officials are still
carrying out desultory checks.
Villagers are not nostalgic about the old days of border controls. They are
hard-headed enough to realise that change is inevitable.
But the concerns of those who benefit from Schengen's privileged border
status are easy to understand. At weekends it is difficult to cross the main
street for queues of German and French cars. The visitors do not come to
Schengen principally for its pretty chateau and church, or even for its
vineyards, sweeping down to the river from the steep hills above the
village. They come for its half dozen petrol stations, all of them
exploiting the excise loophole which means that fuel is LFr10 (19 pence) a
litre cheaper here.
Alcohol and cigarettes are also a better buy in Luxembourg.
As it turns out Schengen has little to fear from the immediate impact of
single-market tax harmonisation. Under the indirect tax deal done with its
EC partners, the Grand Duchy will guard most of its excise advantages at
least until 1995.
Mr Ernest Legill, the village's echevin, or local councillor, and a
wine-grower like most inhabitants, is generally optimistic about what will
happen after January 1.
But like many older villagers he cannot disguise a visceral unease about the
lifting of borders. He remembers the second world war, when the Schengen
bridge was one of the first to be destroyed as the Germans advanced west.
Similar concerns are voiced less diplomatically in the Cafe International
over glasses of the local white wine.
A local haulier, preferring to remain anonymous, points out that now there
are fewer customs and immigrations officials on the bridge, the number of
burglaries in the village has increased.
Mr Schemel and his family also fear the loss of their livelihood. Since 1959
they have worked as customs agents - employed by exporters and importers to
deal with tax forms at borders. Those forms should disappear on December 31,
replaced by an electronic system. But Schengen is where the smooth-running
computerised dream of a thousand EC tax officials breaks down.
Local pessimism reflects wider gloom about the goal of open frontiers.
Growing evidence suggests that companies across the EC are not ready for the
complex new VAT system. Even the ideals of the Schengen accord have soured
in the last few months.
Ministers from the nine countries met in Madrid this week and agreed on a
common visa for the free-travel area. But their January deadline for
completely open borders has slipped at least until the middle of the year.
Passport checks are likely to remain in place well beyond that date in the
UK, Denmark and Ireland.
Such sluggishness will not prevent Mr Zimmer clearing his office on December
31 and leaving the Schengen border crossing unmanned for probably the first
time since the Grand Duchy came into being in 1839.
