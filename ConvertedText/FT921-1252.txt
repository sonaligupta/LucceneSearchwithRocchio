FT  25 MAR 92 / International Company News: Electrolux sees no let-up in
market conditions


   By ANDREW BAXTER


ELECTROLUX, the Swedish household appliances multinational which has
suffered a sharp fall in profits over the past two years, said yesterday
that market conditions would continue to be harsh in 1992.
'Top priority has been assigned to improving profitability through internal
programmes,' said Electrolux, one of the world's top two manufacturers of
white goods with Whirlpool of the US.
The company's forecast was included in its final results statement for 1991,
which differs marginally from figures released on February 4.
Profits after financial items tumbled by 26.8 per cent to SKr1.03bn (Dollars
170m) from SKr1.40bn in 1990. Earnings per share after full tax fell to
SKr5.20 from SKr10.10, while the return on equity after full tax declined to
2.3 per cent from 4.3 per cent.
