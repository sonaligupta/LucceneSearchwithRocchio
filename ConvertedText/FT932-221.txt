FT  30 JUN 93 / US space station wins a reprieve


   By GEORGE GRAHAM


   WASHINGTON


THE US space station now appears likely to survive after efforts to cut off
money for the project failed in the House of Representatives late on Monday
night.
Congressional opponents of the space station failed last week by a single
vote to remove framework authorisation for the project, and had hoped that
Monday's vote on funding could turn their way.
In the end, intensive lobbying by the White House, which has thrown its
weight behind the redesigned station, produced a 220-196 margin of victory
in the funding vote, with half a dozen members switching to support the
station.
The new design for the space station, drafted in three months by a National
Aeronautics and Space Administration team, is expected to cost Dollars 2.1bn
(Pounds 1.4bn) a year over the next five years, with a further Dollars 5.5bn
required to bring it up to permanent occupancy by the end of the century.
The two House votes have been the closest shaves so far for the costly space
station project, on which Dollars 9bn has already been spent. The Senate is
expected to look more favourably on the space station, but Congress as a
whole has taken a new and more sceptical look at many expensive projects of
this sort.
