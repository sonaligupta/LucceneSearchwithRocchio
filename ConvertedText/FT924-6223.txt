FT  23 NOV 92 / Italians convicted of bribery


   By REUTER


   MILAN


Twenty Italian businessmen have been convicted of paying bribes for public
works contracts in a corruption trial that has shaken Italian politics,
Reuter reports from Milan.
Court officials said the men received sentences ranging from one year to 18
months for paying bribes to former Socialist party official Mario Chiesa,
who ran Milan's biggest municipal old people's home. The relatively light
sentences reflected the fact the men agreed to refund some L2bn (Pounds
900,000) made from illicit deals.
