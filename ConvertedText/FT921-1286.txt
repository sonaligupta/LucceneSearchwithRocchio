FT  25 MAR 92 / UK Company News: P&O chiefs buy Pounds 1.5m of shares


   By MAGGIE URRY


LORD STERLING, chairman of Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation, and Mr
Bruce MacPhail, managing director, between them bought shares worth Pounds
1.5m in the company yesterday after announcing results for 1991. Lord
Sterling said this was a mark of confidence in the group's future.
Group turnover was slightly lower at Pounds 4.9bn (Pounds 5.04bn) and
operating profits were Pounds 366.6m, down from Pounds 388.2m.
Despite the Pounds 604m rights issue launched in August last year the
interest charge rose to Pounds 125.4m (Pounds 122.4m). Mr MacPhail said the
group had the use of the rights money for only three months.
Pre-tax profits were Pounds 217.4m (Pounds 261.3m). This showed an
improvement in the second half after interim pre-tax profits fell from
Pounds 132.1m to Pounds 73.1m, but Lord Sterling said this was largely a
seasonal bias towards the second half rather than any signs of recovery.
Earnings per share fell 23 per cent to 31p (40.4p adjusted for the rights)
but the dividend is maintained, as promised with the rights issue, at 30.5p.
Lord Sterling said the dividend policy was based on the group's medium and
long-term prospects, not the short term.
The divisional break down showed a fall in operating profits from the
service industries activities to Pounds 111.6m (Pounds 116.7m), but
passenger shipping profits rose 14 per cent to Pounds 149.8m, excluding a
Pounds 20.8m exceptional charge reflecting the effect on cruises of the Gulf
war.
Container and bulk shipping profits fell to Pounds 59.6m (Pounds 63.9m). Mr
MacPhail said the group does not disclose ship sale profits, which are a
normal part of the business, but they were lower than in 1990.
The housebuilding, construction and development division suffered a loss of
Pounds 20.3m (profit Pounds 15.8m) although this included a loss from the
Pall Mall Properties associate of Pounds 22.4m (loss Pounds 7m).
Investment property profits rose from Pounds 60.1m to Pounds 65.9m. There
was a Pounds 33m write down of investment property values which was charged
to reserves.
At the year end the group's balance sheet showed shareholders' funds of
Pounds 2.27bn (Pounds 1.74bn) and net debt of Pounds 1.07bn (Pounds 1.41bn).
