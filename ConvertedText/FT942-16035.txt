FT  12 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Opec stresses discipline as
production rise reported


   By ROBERT CORZINE


The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries yesterday reminded member
states of the importance of production discipline amid reports that its
output in March exceeded the 24.52m-barrels-a-day ceiling.
Dr Subroto, secretary general, said 'the most important thing now is
production discipline'. He thought prices in the second quarter, usually the
weakest period for demand, would 'not be too bad' if discipline was
maintained.
He said final Opec production figures for March had not been compiled,
although he acknowledged that they were likely to show a slight increase.
Yesterday the Middle East Economic Survey reported that Opec output was
24.99m b/d last month, up from 24.76m b/d in February.
Dr Subroto, in London to attend a conference on Opec's future, said the lack
of cohesion among some of its biggest producers was one of the causes of the
present problems.
Sheikh Ahmed Zaki Yamani, the former Saudi Arabian oil minister, told the
conference Opec states were divided into two camps. The interests of big
producers with spare capacity - Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iraq when it is
allowed to resume exports - lay in 'high volumes, low prices and expanding
markets'. Most of the other nine members, however, had little spare capacity
and were mainly interested in price increases.
