FT  21 APR 94 / Energy bill may fall at final hurdle


   By BRONWEN MADDOX


The Energy Conservation bill, which faces its final hurdle in the Commons
tomorrow, looks likely to be killed off by last-minute amendments from the
government and Conservative backbenchers, Bronwen Maddox writes.
Mr Alan Beith, deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats who introduced the
bill, said he had counted 216 amendments to the bill and seven new clauses.
Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, filed 53 of the amendments and three
of the new clauses, and backbenchers submitted the rest late on Tuesday
night.
Energy conservation pressure groups fear there will not be time to debate
the amendments in the bill's third reading tomorrow.
The bill would oblige local authorities to assess the energy efficiency of
households in their area. Ministers are concerned that the bill could result
in an unnecessary financial burden on central and local government.
