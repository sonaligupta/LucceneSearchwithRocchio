FT  30 JAN 92 / International Company News: New South Wales debt rating
confirmed


   By BRUCE JACQUES


MOODY'S Investor Service, the US ratings agency, has confirmed its AAA
rating on the debt of one Australian state but given a negative view on two
others, writes Bruce Jacques.
Government debt of Australia's most populous state, New South Wales, has
retained its AAA rating, with Moody's citing decisive action by the state
government to counteract the negative budgetary effects of the country's
economic downturn.
'The rating agency's review has evaluated the impact of current negative
trends on the state's fiscal position and it concluded that these trends
have not caused substantial medium term damage to New South Wales'
creditworthiness,' Moody's said.
But the ratings agency has reduced its rating on the debt of the Western
Australian government from AAA to AA1 and it is also reviewing the AA1
rating which is held by the South Australian government.
