FT  11 APR 94 / Cairo anti-terrorist chief killed

   CAIRO


Egyptian police believe five gunmen firing from a car and a motorcycle
assassinated the country's top anti-terrorist official as he left his home
near the Giza Pyramids, security officials said yesterday, AP reports from
Cairo.
The killing over the weekend was the most daring operation carried out in
Cairo in the two-year campaign by Moslem radicals to overthrow the secular
government and turn Egypt into an Islamic state.
It showed that, despite government claims to have curbed the extremists,
they were able to strike in the capital and kill the official assigned to
destroy them. Maj Gen Raouf Khayrat was deputy chief of state security
intelligence in charge of religious terrorist activities.
In the radicals' stronghold in southern Egypt yesterday, police said
unidentified gunmen killed a policeman in the village of al-Qusiya.
The Islamic fundamentalist extremists regularly kill police in southern
Egypt but the slaying of Gen Khayrat was the first major attack in Cairo
since a homemade bomb was thrown at a tourist bus last December, wounding
eight Austrians and as many Egyptians.
More than 350 people have been killed since the radicals started their
violent campaign in January 1992. Most have been police or radicals killed
in battles, but the extremists also have attacked officials, tourists and
members of the Coptic Christian minority. Four foreign tourists have died.
