FT  07 JAN 94 / Argentina's unions in tax investigation


   By JOHN BARHAM


   BUENOS AIRES


Argentina's feared tax inspectors are investigating suspected large-scale
tax evasion at the country's trade unions. The investigation co-incides with
a bitter dispute between President Carlos Menem's Peronist government and
Peronist union bosses and over labour market reform and union funding.
The unions have threatened to call a general strike this month in protest at
the government's decision to cut company tax contributions to union-run
welfare funds, part of the strategy of Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister,
for reducing Argentina's high labour costs.
The cuts, variously estimated at the equivalent of Dollars 400m-Dollars 800m
(Pounds 269m-Pounds 538m) a year, strike at the heart of the unions'
finances. The money, which together with union dues and employee
contributions adds up to about Dollars 2bn a year, is channelled into union
health and welfare funds.
It is widely suspected union leaders skim money from these funds to finance
their luxurious lifestyles.
Mr Ricardo Cossio, head of the tax department, said yesterday he was also
investigating bosses' personal wealth. But, he said, 'there is absolutely no
link to political problems.'
This cuts little ice with the union leaders, who complain of 'persecution.'
Mr Menem, who is attempting to stand for a second presidential term, clearly
feels he has little to fear from union opposition.
