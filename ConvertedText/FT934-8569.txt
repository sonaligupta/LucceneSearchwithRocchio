FT  15 NOV 93 / People: Babcock International


Allan Smith is retiring from the board of Babcock International a year after
the official retirement age of 60.
He will stay on at Babcock Thorn, which runs the warship builder Rosyth
Royal Dockyard, but moves from managing director to executive chairman.
Smith, who joined Babcock 38 years ago as a graduate trainee, intends to
retire as chairman when the government decides whether Babcock will continue
to run the yard after the current contract with the MoD expires in 1995.
