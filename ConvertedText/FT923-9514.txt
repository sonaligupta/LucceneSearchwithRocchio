FT  05 AUG 92 / Car parks urged to boost security


   By BETHAN HUTTON


A HOME OFFICE minister yesterday called on operators of car parks to improve
security for motorists.
'Car thieves can have rich pickings in poorly managed car parks,' Mr Michael
Jack, Home Office minister, said at the launch of a report into crime at car
parks. The study covered 52 car parks in the London area and was carried out
as part of Car Crime Prevention Year by the Home Office police research
group.
Mr Jack said one in five stolen cars was taken from a car park. 'This is not
acceptable. Car-park users have the right to expect a minimum level of
security for the fees they pay.'
The study found that unstaffed 'pay and display' car parks and long-stay
commuter car parks had the highest crime rates.
Those with low crime levels were characterised by a 'customer service'
attitude on the part of management, and a greater willingness to accept
liability for theft and damage.
The Automobile Association and Consumers Association both called for
car-park users to have some legal redress against operators if their
vehicles were broken into, and suggested that car parking be covered by the
Fair Trading Act. Provision of car parking is not classified as a service
and so is outside the act.
The AA said: 'Other consumer products worth far less than the cost of a
day's parking are subject to all-embracing consumer protection legislation.'
The main car-park operators will be invited to discuss the problem with Mr
Jack. More than eight in 10 petrol stations last year suffered crimes
including armed robbery, attacks on staff, burglary, fraud, theft and
vandalism, according to a survey of petrol retailers published yesterday.
