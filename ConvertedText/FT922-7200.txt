FT  20 MAY 92 / World Trade News: UK stake in Romanian TV deal


   By VIRGINIA MARSH


   BUCHAREST


A UK-led consortium has won the right to operate one of Romania's two TV
channels, representatives of the group, led by Atlantic Television, said
after signing the deal yesterday, Virginia Marsh reports from Bucharest. The
new station, Channel 2 TV Romania, would be the first national commercial TV
channel in the former Soviet bloc.
Mr Robin Edwards, managing director of Atlantic Television, a
Canadian-registered company, said the new group would 'set the standard' for
other ex-Comecon countries still formulating their audio-visual laws.
The deal gives the new channel, a joint-venture company allocating a 20 per
cent stake to Radio Televiziunea, Romania's state broadcasting company,
broadcasting rights for 15 years, with option on a further five. Bucharest
had put no restrictions on the content of programmes, said Mr Edwards, a
non-executive director of Westcountry Television of the UK. The channel was
conceived as a high-quality, non-political station, to broadcast news, drama
and light entertainment.
It will import half its programmes from the west. The company's main
financial backer is Mr Minos Kyriakou, owner of Antenna, an Athens-based TV
station. The new channel, which Atlantic hopes will be functioning by the
end of the year, plans to recoup an initial Dollars 25m (Pounds 14m)
investment through advertising. The station is allowed to air up to nine
minutes of commercials every hour.
