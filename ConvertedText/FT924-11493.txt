FT  26 OCT 92 / Lautro orders life policy inquiry


   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU


LAURENTIAN Life, the life assurance company, confirmed yesterday that
Lautro, the industry regulator, had started an inquiry into the possible
sale of tens of thousands of unsuitable policies, Scheherazade Daneshkhu
writes.
The move follows a preliminary review of several hundred policies by Lautro,
which raised doubts that best advice had been given to customers. Unless the
review of a further 3,000 policies - by Tillinghurst, the consulting
actuaries - contradicts the Lautro findings, Laurentian Life will be asked
to review all policies sold by its tied agents.
Lautro, which earlier this year summoned the chairman of Laurentian, Lord
Marsh - a former cabinet minister - over the issue, is particularly
concerned about the sale of policies by tied agents who had not gathered
sufficient information about clients.
Lautro fears that Laurentian's salesmen have sold long-term savings plans -
which pay rich commission to them - to young people with no dependants and
that individuals have been transferred out of occupational pension schemes
to personal pensions with no good reason.
Mr Paul Stott, head of communications at Laurentian, denied reports that any
compensation to its clients would be 'financially disastrous'.
