venture


   By Agencies


   MEXICO CITY


K MART, the US retailer, and El Puerto de Liverpool, the Mexican discount
retailer, are to form a joint retailing venture in Mexico, agencies report
from Mexico City.
The Troy, Michigan-based retailer declined to specify how much money it will
invest in the project but it is believed the companies plan an investment of
about Dollars 250m each.
The ultimate goal is to open 100 discount stores, according Mr Enrique
Bremond, El Puerto de Liverpool's board chairman.
Initially, the companies hope to open two or three pilot stores in Mexico
City sometime next year. The venture will create 36,000 jobs in Mexico, said
Mr Bremond.
El Puerto de Liverpool operates 17 full-line department stores in Mexico. K
mart operates 2,400 stores in the US and Canada and has equity interests in
Coles Meyer, 15 stores in Puerto Rico and 13 stores in Czechoslovakia.
The move is K mart's first foray into Latin America. Mexico promises to be a
lucrative discount retailing market and follows other recent ventures in the
sector.
Wal-Mart Stores of the US - one of K mart's rivals - has a similar venture
with Cifra SA, the Mexican retailing giant, while Price Club has teamed up
with Comercial Mexicana. Gigiante of Mexico also announced a venture last
month with the Fleming Cos.
