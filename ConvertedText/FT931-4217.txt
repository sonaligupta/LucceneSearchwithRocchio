FT  11 MAR 93 / International Company News: BCE gains 18% of Talisman in
share swap

   MONTREAL


BCE, the international telecommunications group, is exchanging its common
and convertible preferred shares of Encor, a lossmaking oil and gas
development and production company in western Canada, for 18.6 per cent of
Talisman, the former BP Canada.
The 12m new Talisman common shares being issued to BCE have a market value
of almost CDollars 240m (USDollars 192m).
The deal is part of a merger between Talisman and Encor, formerly the
exploration and production arm of TransCanada PipeLines. BCE now holds 18.6m
Encor common shares and all Encor's convertible preferred stock.
BCE said the merger would create a stronger oil and gas group. But analysts
expect it to eventually sell the Talisman holding. Under the merger,
Talisman offers one of its common shares trading at just under CDollars 20
for every 60 Encor common shares.
