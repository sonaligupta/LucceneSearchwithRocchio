FT  12 MAR 92 / Observer: Red faces


'Grubby, filthy and downright dirty' runs the teaser advertising campaign
for Lever Brothers' latest liquid detergent which will be launched on 'Blue
Nose Day' in less than a fortnight's time. Rarely have truer words been
spoken.
The campaign, which appears on the sides of thousands of buses, bears a
remarkable similarity to the Comic Relief charity's 'Red Nose' day which is
normally held at this time of year. The only difference is that Comic Relief
is taking a rest this year. No doubt a court of law can tell the difference
between a 'red' and 'blue' nose day. But the idea seems to be piggy-backing
on the general enthusiasm for a worthwhile charity and Comic Relief says it
has been deluged with calls from eager young volunteers.
It's not the sort of behaviour one would expect from a company which likes
to think of itself as one of the country's most squeaky clean corporate
citizens.
