FT  25 MAR 92 / German money supply worries


   By ANDREW FISHER


   FRANKFURT


THE PROSPECT of an early reduction in Germany's official interest rates
receded further yesterday with news that money supply growth continued to
exceed the Bundesbank's target range by a wide margin in February.
The central bank said M3, the broad monetary aggregate, expanded at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 8.5 per cent last month compared with the
average in the fourth quarter of 1991. This was a slight decline on the 9
per cent rate in January, but economists said M3 expansion was still too
high to allow any scope for relaxing monetary controls. The target range is
growth of between 3.5 and 5.5 per cent this year.
The Bundesbank lifted interest rates by half a point in December to leave
the discount rate at 8 per cent and the Lombard rate at 9.75 per cent.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl is understood to have backed the Bundesbank's tough
monetary line when he attended its council meeting last Thursday.
The Bundesbank said the main force propelling M3 was the volume of bank
lending to companies and individuals, though this had weakened slightly;
long-term lending remained strong, while short-term lending eased. In the
past six months, it has risen at an annual seasonally adjusted rate of 11.5
per cent.
