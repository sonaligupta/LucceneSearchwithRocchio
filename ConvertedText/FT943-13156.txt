FT  21 JUL 94 / International Company News: Sabic extends recovery with 57%
half-year rise

   CAIRO


Saudi Arabian Basic Industries Corporation, the 70 per cent state-owned
industrial and petrochemicals group, has reported a 57 per cent rise in
earnings for the first half to SR1.35bn (Dollars 360m), consolidating a
strong turnround in profits which began in the last quarter of 1993.
Sabic attributed the growth to a combination of improved world prices for
its products, which include petrochemicals, plastics, fertilisers and steel,
and a substantial rise in gross output as new projects came on stream.
Total second-quarter revenues were SR6.28bn against SR4.88bn for the
corresponding quarter last year, according to Mr Ibrahim Ibn Salameh,
Sabic's vice-chairman and managing director.
The group's gross output for the first six months reached 7.95m tonnes, a
rise of 36 per cent over 1993. Sabic said output was on target to reach
total capacity of 20m tonnes a year by the end of 1994.
Sabic is well into an ambitious expansion scheme which, at an estimated cost
by the end of this year of Dollars 4bn, will have seen expansion at 12 of
the holding company's 18 subsidiaries or affiliates.
The first-half turnround follows growth of about 10 per cent in earnings
during the last quarter of 1993 following falls in earnings in both 1991 and
1992 - largely attributed to soft world petrochemical prices.
Sabic, with total assets up 6 per cent at SR37.5bn, claims to command 5 per
cent of global petrochemical markets.
