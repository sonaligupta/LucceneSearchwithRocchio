FT  04 AUG 92 / Letter: A different perspective on Cyprus


   From Mr HOMER HABIBIS


Sir, Berin Lewis ('Turkish Cypriots suffered', Letters, July 22) does
injustice to the concept and to the substance of your leading article of
July 16 ('They must be stopped').
Turkey invaded Cyprus in 1974, when the Cyprus government had been
overthrown by a coup which was stage-managed from Greece; 200,000 members of
the Greek Cypriot majority community were expelled by the invaders from the
occupied area in a blatant act of state-sponsored 'ethnic cleansing'.
Your editorial is supported by the formal findings of the Council of
Europe's Commission of Human Rights, published on April 2 1992. (Report on
Application No. 8007/77 Cyprus against Turkey.)
Neither during the intercommunal incidents of 1963-64, nor in the period
before the 1974 invasion, was there any state-sponsored cleansing or killing
of Turkish Cypriots in Cyprus. The UN peacekeeping force, on the spot since
early 1964, can provide independent testimony exposing the falsehood of your
correspondent's claim.
On the other hand, it is on historical record that Turkish air force planes
bombed Cypriot Greek villages in 1964; that the Cyprus government offered
economic incentives to Turkish Cypriots to return to their native villages;
and that from 1968 to 1973, Turkish Cypriot leaders took part in
intercommunal talks with Greek Cypriots for a negotiated agreement.
