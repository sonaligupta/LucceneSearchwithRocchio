FT  30 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Tomkins buys control of valve maker


TOMKINS, the industrial conglomerate, is paying nearly Pounds 11m for the
outstanding 60 per cent of Guest & Chrimes, a maker and supplier of cast
iron valves and hydrants for the water industry.
A 40 per cent interest in Guest came into the group with the 1986
acquisition of Pegler Hattersley and it will join those valve and tap
businesses in the fluid controls division.
Mr Greg Hutchings, chief executive, said Guest took the group further into
the UK water industry, which was benefiting from a big capital spending
programme.
In 1990, Guest made pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.5m on sales of Pounds 12.7m
and had net assets of Pounds 9m at the end of that year.
Most of the consideration is through the issue of 2.25m Tomkins shares. The
remaining Pounds 1.25m is in loan notes. The stake is being purchased from
the family owners.
Tomkins recently announced a 40 per cent increase to Pounds 43.7m in interim
pre-tax profits on sales of Pounds 594.5m.
