FT  13 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: New technology for Channel 5 not in
viewers' interests


   From Mr JOHN HOWKINS


Sir, The letter by Richard Norman of the British Radio and Electronic
Equipment Manufacturers Association (April 8) said that manufacturers do not
want Channel 5, which could be on air next year, to use 'existing
technology'. He proposes a new digital technology which is not yet available
and which cannot be received on existing TV sets. This is not surprising,
since his members gain if viewers have to buy new sets. But it is not in the
viewers' interests.
He gives no evidence as to why the existing technology in every TV set,
video, etc, is no good. He just says that it has been overtaken by other
technology. It has not. Everyone's analogue TV set should last a long time.
His approach smacks of interventionism of a high order, with an echo of the
European Union's failed attempt to impose the Mac standards, which BREMA
backed, on satellite broadcasters. Modern communications policy should not
be based on the manufacturers' desire to make things.
Mr Norman is highly optimistic about digital broadcasting. But I doubt
anyone will be broadcasting digital TV terrestrially in 'three to five
years'. Anyway, it would take many years for digital to reach the kind of
coverage that Channel 5 will have from day one.
He says digital technology will bring 'six to eight channels'. Fine. Anybody
who wants six to eight channels now, or indeed 16 to 18, can get them from
the Astra satellite.
Channel 5 offers extra choice on existing TV sets. I am sorry to disappoint
the manufacturers, but that is what the viewer prefers.
