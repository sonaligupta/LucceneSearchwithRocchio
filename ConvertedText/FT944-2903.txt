FT  15 DEC 94 / International Company News: Euro Disney cuts price of
tickets by 20%

   PARIS


Euro Disney shares yesterday rose after it said that from April it would cut
by about 20 per cent the price of tickets into its loss-making theme park
outside Paris.
Mr Philippe Bourguignon, chairman, said the reduction was the culmination of
other cuts in operating costs and hotel rates over the past 18 months and
would 'get us out of the negative spiral in which high costs led to high
rates and lower attendance'.
News of the price cut pushed Euro Disney shares up 25 centimes to FFr9.60 in
Paris, although the company forecast said that, given its timing, the
pricing move would have little effect on results for the year ending
September 1995. It said its goal was still to break even in 1995-96.
Mr Xavier de Mezrac, financial director, said Euro Disney could expect a 1
per cent to 2 per cent increase in visitors for every 1 per cent cut in the
price of entry. But he gave no forecast of likely increase in attendance,
except to say he was confident the park would at least attract the extra
700,000 visitors needed to compensate for lower priced tickets.
The new price cut will bring the cost of an adult entry ticket down from
FFr225-FFr250 to FFr195 during the April to September peak season, and from
FFr175-FFr225 to FFr150 for October to March off-peak season, excluding
Christmas.
Turnover would fall by 3 per cent to 5 per cent if the price cut failed to
attract more customers because entry receipts formed only part of total
income, said Mr Mezrac. He described this as the worst case scenario.
Mr Bourguignon said the last quarter of this year had seen a rise in
attendance over the level in the same period of last year.
In the year to September 30, Euro Disney reduced its loss to FFr1.8bn
(Dollars 332m) from FFr5.3bn a year earlier, although attendance fell from
9.8m to 8.8m visitors over the same period.
Euro Disney said yesterday it had signed an agreement with a division of the
Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy (LVMH) French luxury goods group to develop
housing at the resort.
In addition, it was negotiating with a cinema operator to build a 12-screen
cinema complex in the park.
