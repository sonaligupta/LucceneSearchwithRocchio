FT  26 OCT 92 / Foreign Exchanges and Money Markets: Dollars waiting to soar


   By JAMES BLITZ


THE DOLLAR is likely to trade in an uncertain manner against the D-Mark
between now and the US Presidential election on November 3, writes James
Blitz
The markets are assuming that Mr Bill Clinton will win the election, and
many analysts expect the dollar to soar in the aftermath of that victory.
They argue that Mr Clinton's commitment to increase public spending will
check the US Federal Reserve's policy of cutting interest rates. The
expected easing of German policy will also narrow the differential between
US and German rates that has driven the market this year.
The dollar's rise to a high of DM1.5365 in European trading on Friday was
proof that this is how dealers are thinking. But this week, several US
economic indicators may check the market's ebullience, reminding traders
that the US economic upturn is a slow one.
Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, believes that the
figure for third quarter GDP in the US, due out on Tuesday, may show
quarter-to-quarter growth below one per cent.
He also believes that consumer confidence figures due out on Tuesday on
Friday will disappoint the market.
Dealers will again focus on the fortnightly Bundesbank council on Thursday.
In the run-up to the last two council meetings, the market has got very
excited about the prospect of a cut in official rates, only to show huge
disappointment when the cut fails to come.
In the UK, the main event of the week will be the chancellor's keynote
speech at the Mansion House on Thursday. The government has put a new
emphasis on cutting rates and 'going for growth.' But the speech will be
analysed carefully for further hints on how this is to be achieved.
