FT  18 APR 94 / Emerging Markets: Ashanti Goldfields offer assured of
success - The Emerging Investor


   By PAUL ADAMS


A last-minute agreement to convert government liabilities to public sector
workers into shares in Ashanti Goldfields Corporation seems to have assured
the success of the Ghanaian public offer of the Ashanti flotation, the
latest privatisation on the fast-growing Ghana stock exchange.
It is estimated that the conversion to shares of the government's debts to
staff, dating back to the presidential elections in October 1992, has
accounted for sales of Dollars 15m to Dollars 20m, while shares worth
between Dollars 18m and Dollars 25m have been bought for cash by
institutions and private investors.
Some 10,000 AGC employees are to receive five free shares each in the
flotation.
Even the local element of the Ashanti flotation is so large that its effect
on the Ghana stock exchange is hard to forecast.
The Ashanti shares to be offered exclusively to the Ghanaian market will be
worth at least Dollars 68m, equivalent to 37 per cent of the Accra stock
market's total capitalisation (about Dollars 180m at the end of March) prior
to the flotation.
Since only 43 per cent of the market capitalisation is owned by Ghanaian
public portfolio investors, the two local Ashanti offers will almost double
the amount of shares which are actually available on the stock exchange.
The total initial value of Ashanti shares in the flotation is at least
Dollars 368m. But the majority will be traded on the London stock exchange,
and some Ghanaian investors may take a quick profit by selling Ashanti
shares on the London market if they show a premium after dealing begins on
Tuesday.
The first Ghanaian public offer makes up about 3 per cent of Ashanti's new
capital. But priced at between Dollars 17 and Dollars 20 a share it is worth
about 10 per cent of total bank liquidity in Ghana, a large amount of
savings for a nation whose investors are mainly unfamiliar with the equity
market.
A further 1.4 per cent of AGC stock will be open to Ghanaians in the fixed
price offer in May.
Brokers are pleased with the outcome. 'I think it was a clever move,' said
Mr Ken Offori-Attah, head of Databank Brokerage, which produces the Accra
market share price index.
'It helps the government to achieve its objective of widening the investor
base of this market, as there are over 100,000 civil servants who could have
bought stock.'
But Mr Miles Morland, of Blakeney Management in the UK, believes that the
government, advised by James Capel and Morgan Grenfell in London, should
have offered the local shares at a discount to the international price.
'The Ashanti flotation was tailored mostly for the big foreign institutions.
But it could have created greater interest among the Ghanaian public, most
of whom have not previously bought shares,' he says. 'Incentives were needed
to attract domestic investors, which is what this market really needs to
sustain growth.'
That growth has been phenomenal.
The Databank index gained over 60 per cent last year in dollar terms. And in
the first quarter of this year the index has risen by nearly 70 per cent
after devaluation of the local currency, the cedi.
Leaders among the 15 listed stocks, including Kumasi Brewery, Mobil,
Standard Chartered and Unilever, are putting on 5 per cent a week, according
to Databank.
The rise is based partly on the profits growth of the 15 quoted companies,
mostly subsidiaries of multinationals. It also reflects foreign investors'
interest in an emerging market which is one of the few good prospects in
sub-Saharan Africa.
In 1993 the profits of Standard Chartered Ghana rose by 70 per cent, showing
the best return on capital anywhere in the banking group, while profits
growth of Unilever Ghana was 33 per cent and Guinness Ghana 76 per cent.
Before the market became international last year, share prices in Ghana were
well below net book value, with an average price earnings ratio of 8.7.
'Ghana is still one of the cheapest markets in the world and that is what
will continue to attract foreign investors,' said Mr Morland.
'But it needs a healthy domestic investor market, and that depends partly on
whether the government can get the macro-economic management right.'
The performance of the 15 listed companies tells only half the story.
As public spending rose out of control, finance minister Mr Kwesi Botchwey
raised interest rates and is trying to bring down inflation. This in turn is
squeezing the smaller companies which must form the basis of Ghana's
expected economic growth. This has been underpinned by large inflows of aid
sponsored by the IMF's backing for Ghana's stuctural adjustment programme
and the country's recent political stability.
International investors took all of the Dollars 25m of government stock in
seven listed companies which the state divested in a placing in February,
handled by Databank and initiated by Blakeney Management.
The placing has been criticised because no stock was offered to Ghanaian
investors, including the multinationals who held a large part of the other
shares.
Databank argues that the deal gave the market a big lift when Ghanaian
investors saw that offshore funds were prepared to invest that heavily. The
government has accepted some of the criticism and is to offer the remaining
Dollars 2m to Dollars 3m of shares in the seven stocks still in government
hands to the public this week.
Under pressure from the World Bank, the government says it will speed up its
privatisation programme and has retained UK consultants to help the
Divestiture Implementation Committee.
