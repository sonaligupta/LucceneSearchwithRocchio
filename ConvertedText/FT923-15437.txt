FT  02 JUL 92 / International Company News: Chrysler's debt talks advance


   By PATRICK HARVERSON and ALAN FRIEDMAN


   NEW YORK


CHRYSLER'S negotiations with its bankers over the rescheduling of more than
Dollars 6.8bn of the company's debt should be concluded this month,
according to Mr Lee Iacocca, the chairman.
Talks were 'going very well,' thanks to some of Chrysler's newly-launched
vehicles and improving sales outlook, Mr Iacocca said.
An agreement should be reached by July 30, but could be finalised sooner.
Mr Iacocca said the company was ready to operate profitably selling between
2m and 2.5m vehicles a year over the next five years.
General Electric of the US said it hoped by 1995 to have between 5 and 10
per cent of the world market in small motors for use in residential heating,
ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, writes Alan Friedman in New
York.
