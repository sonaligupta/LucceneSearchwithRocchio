FT  09 JAN 92 / Labour may punish polluters


   By DAVID OWEN


A LABOUR government might penalise electricity companies which fail to meet
conservation and efficiency targets in order to encourage energy saving and
protect the environment, Mr Frank Dobson, shadow energy secretary, indicated
yesterday.
Under one option, companies that missed such targets might be forced to
charge lower prices for their electricity or suffer restrictions on the
returns they were allowed to make.
In the shorter term, companies that did not achieve adequate results in the
specific area of home insulation might be threatened with sanctions
including the loss of their licences.
'We will need to look in great detail at how we best benefit the customers
and save energy by changing the operational and financial regime,' Mr Dobson
said.
Labour is studying attempts by US regulators to encourage greater energy
conservation, and intends to strengthen UK regulatory regimes.
