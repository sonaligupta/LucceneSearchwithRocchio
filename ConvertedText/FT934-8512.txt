years - Automotive

MAZDA says it expects to make a pre-tax loss of Y32bn (Dollars 301m) this
year - its first for 18 years - after posting a pre-tax loss of Y15.5bn for
the first six months to September.
The Japanese carmaker blamedweak demand at home and in Europe, as well as
the sharp appreciation of the yen, as sales slipped by 22 per cent to
Y876.08bn from Y1,129.56bn in the same period last year.
The company, which said it would pass its dividend, made a pre-tax profit of
Y3.06bn at the same stage last year.
Mazda, which is 25 per cent owned by Ford Motor of the US, suffered a
setback in most of its markets. Exports fell 25 per cent while in Japan, the
company saw a 17 per cent decrease in factory unit sales.
While demand in Asia, Africa, central and South America was firm, shipments
to North America, Europe and the Middle East were sluggish, mainly due to
weak demand in Europe and the strong yen.
The restructuring plan Mazda drew up in June is having to be reviewed in the
worsening trading environment. Under the original plan, costs were to be
reduced by 30 per cent and personnel by 1,500 over the next three years.
However, the company is bringing forward plans to restructure operations and
the number of staff to be reduced through natural wastage over the next
three years has been increased to 3,000.
Fuji Heavy Industries, which makes Subaru cars, also reported a sharp
deterioration in its business performance.
The company suffered a pre-tax interim loss of Y19bn on sales down 11 per
cent to Y356.60bn from Y399.86bn. It is passing its interim dividend. The
loss came despite sales of fixed assets.
Fuji was hit hard by the fall in domestic sales of mini cars and exports of
passenger cars, which fell by about 20 per cent. Its financial position also
worsened due to the need to redeem equity warrant bonds.
Meanwhile, Suzuki, the largest maker of mini cars in Japan and the world's
third largest maker of motorcycles, managed to report interim pre-tax
profits of Y9.18bn on sales that were 0.2 per cent down to Y517.72bn.
Suzuki's performance was helped by strong demand for its motorcycles
overseas and for its recreational vehicles in Japan.
The company is forecasting pre-tax profits for the full year to next March
of Y18bn on sales of Y1,020bn. The forecast compares with profits of Y20.5bn
on sales of Y1,053bn for fiscal 1992. This would be the first annual sales
drop for Suzuki and the third decline in profits.
