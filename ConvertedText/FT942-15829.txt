FT  13 APR 94 / International Company News: Euro Disney banks hope to tie up
deal next week

The Euro Disney banks expect by the end of next week to have finalised their
FFr13bn (Dollars 2.2bn) rescue package to salvage the troubled leisure
group.
All but four of the 61 international banks in the Euro Disney loan
syndicates have agreed to the first stage of the restructuring process - an
18-month interest holiday.
The banks that have agreed represent 96 per cent of Euro Disney's FFr20.3bn
net debt.
A senior banker involved with the negotiations said it was hoped that the
remaining four banks, which include three Japanese institutions and Canada's
Bank of Nova Scotia, would accept within the next few days.
'It's already a done deal,' the banker said. 'But we still hope to achieve a
unanimous agreement.'
The next stage of the process involves endorsing the entire FFr13bn
restructuring, including a FFr6bn rights issue and a number of asset
transactions, and organising underwriting for the rights issue.
A number of banks are understood to have already in principle accepted the
restructuring and to have volunteered to participate in the rights issue.
Walt Disney, the US entertainment company that owns 49 per cent of Euro
Disney, is committed to taking up its full entitlement, leaving the banks to
underwrite the remaining FFr3.06bn worth of shares.
Caisse des Depots, the state-controlled French financial institution that is
Euro Disney's biggest lender, has promised to underwrite FFr790m of the
issue. Banque Nationale de Paris and Banque Indosuez, joint heads of the
banks' steering committee, have pledged FFr300m and FFr200m respectively.
'We've already received assurances for underwriting FFr1.29bn, or 42 per
cent of the issue,' said the banker, 'and we're confident that we'll be able
to cover the rest.'
