FT  22 OCT 92 / Summers calls for economic rethink


   By REUTER


   SINGAPORE


A senior World Bank official yesterday called for richer nations to adopt
active economic policies and ease 1980s-style fear of inflation to revive
growth, Reuter reports from Singapore.
'If we're going to do better in the next decade I don't think there's any
alternative to greater government action,' Mr Lawrence Summers, bank
vice-president and chief economist, said in a speech to economists and
officials in Singapore.
Mr Summers said industrial nations should ease adherence to the tight-money,
non-interventionist dogma of the 1980s - including fear of inflation and a
reluctance to fine-tune economies through targeted government spending and
flexible policies.
'In combating the current recession, we are living with the legacy of these
policies,' he said. 'There is no magic in zero inflation.'
'The lesson is that governments must use all the tools available, both
fiscal and monetary, to address the problem.'
Mr Summers earlier said the outlook for the world's leading industrial
countries remained grim. 'It's hard to be optimistic about the recovery. The
European situation looks much bleaker than three months ago ..I don't think
there is any prospect for an extremely rapid American recovery. We are still
in the tunnel, and the light at the end of the tunnel is still relatively
dim.'
