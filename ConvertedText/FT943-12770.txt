FT  22 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Billiton news expected


   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO


Traders scrambled for Shell Transport as a shortage of stock was compounded
by strong speculation that the long awaited Dollars 1bn sale of the
company's metals business might be no more than days away.
Negotiations over the sale of Shell's Billiton metals business in South
Africa to Gencor have hung over the market for more than a year. A further
delay was announced at the beginning of July.
Yesterday the company's official comment was: 'We are expecting a conclusion
to the deal shortly.' But insiders said they believed it would be signed by
the end of next week.
Ms Irene Himona, oils analyst from SGST, said: 'It looks like they are
getting their act together on rationalisation. They will get rid of a
loss-making division and can reinvest elsewhere.' She added that although it
was too early to adjust forecasts, successful use of the cash could add
Pounds 150m to profits.
Meanwhile, dealers said a line of shares bought as part of a programme trade
early in the day added to the pressure and prompted some traders to buy back
stock and close out bear positions.
There was also support from an upbeat recommendation by Nomura early in the
week. The shares jumped 14 to 736p on active turnover of 5.6m.
