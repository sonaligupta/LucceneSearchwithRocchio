FT  23 APR 93 / Salomon falls into Dollars 102m loss in quarter


   By PATRICK HARVERSON


   NEW YORK


SALOMON, the Wall Street securities house and energy trading group,
yesterday announced a pre-charge net loss of Dollars 65m (Pounds 42m) for
the first quarter after its Salomon Brothers brokerage subsidiary fell into
the red because of short-term losses on its proprietary trading activities.
The total net loss for the group, however, came in at Dollars 102m because
Salomon took a Dollars 37m charge to cover the impact of changes in the
accounting of post-retirement benefits. In the same quarter a year ago the
group earned net income of Dollars 190m.
The news did not come as a surprise because Salomon warned in early March it
had incurred a large loss on its trading business during the first two
months of the year. The size of the shortfall at Salomon Brothers, however,
was smaller than expected.
In March Salomon said that between January and February it had lost Dollars
250m (pre-tax) at its securities brokerage operation.
However, yesterday, the firm said its loss for the whole quarter was only
Dollars 89m, and that included a Dollars 25m charge to cover legal costs
relating to the 1991 Treasury auction scandal.
The company would not comment on the specific numbers, but it appears there
was a significant positive swing in Salomon Brothers' trading positions
during March.
Salomon's investment banking and commissions revenues were both strong in
the quarter, reflecting heavy demand for the firm's underwriting and client
brokerage services.
