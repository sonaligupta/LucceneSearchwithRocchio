FT  05 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Restructured Prior in stronger position


Prior, the property trading and investment group that has recently completed
a financial restructuring, returned pre-tax profits of Pounds 347,000 for
the year to March 31.
Directors said the year was devoted to negotiations and reaching agreement
with the group's bankers on the capital restructure. They added that the
profit arose from the release of a former provision for a guarantee in
respect of a discontinued operation.
In the previous year the group, ultimately owned by Scanfrost - a company
controlled by the family trust of Mr James Prior - incurred a deficit of
Pounds 5.18m.
Directors pointed out that the group now had 'cash in the bank, a totally
ungeared position with positive cash flow, a profitable business . . . a
nucleus of income producing properties and the possibility of substantial
tax losses to be set against future profits'.
