FT  21 DEC 92 / UK Company News: SME sells controlling stake in sweets unit

   MILAN, PARIS


SME, the Italian state-owned foods, catering and retailing group which is
high on the government's privatisation list, has sold control of its Adams
sweets and candies subsidiary to Parke-Davis of the US.
Parke-Davis is paying just L660m (Dollars 434,783) for the 51 per cent of
Adams it does not own. However, it will take over Adams's debts of about
L22bn and losses this year estimated to be about L11bn.
Adams, which expects sales of L45bn this year, is the third of the four
joint ventures set up by SME in recent years to have been sold to the
minority partner as part of the group's strategy to divest non-core food
production activities.
Barilla, Italy's biggest privately-owned foods group, which is a market
leader in pasta, biscuits and cakes, expects group sales to rise by about 20
per cent this year to L3,350bn.
Part of the increase stems from the consolidation of Pavesi, in which
Barilla holds 59 per cent of the shares having bought a further 10 per cent
from SME earlier this year. Pavesi's turnover is expected to reach about
L320bn this year.
In 1991, Barilla made net profits of L155.5bn on group sales of L2,754bn.
Carrefour and the German retail group Metro Vermoegensverwaltung will create
a joint venture in Italy, said the French hypermarket's newly nominated
chief executive Mr Daniel Bernand, Reuter reports from Paris.
He added that Carrefour will hold 60 per cent of the capital of the venture
and Metro 40 per cent. Carrefour's store near Venice, scheduled to open in
May, will be part of the venture. Metro has no outlets in Italy at present.
