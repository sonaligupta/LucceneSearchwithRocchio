FT  12 MAR 93 / Observer: Parkinson's predictors


A mystery has been left by the historian Professor Northcote Parkinson who
died aged 83 on Wednesday, 38 years after revealing his first law: 'Work
expands to fill the time available for its completion'.
It has since become at least as well known as any of the formulations of
economists. Nor - like his second law: 'Expenditure rises to meet income' -
does it seem any less true as a predictor of real events.
Hence the mystery. Why have managers not acted to eliminate the monstrously
wasteful effects the laws describe?
A possible reason is that both of them are products of human ambition. The
organisational manifestation of it that fascinated Parkinson is the pursuit
of power by empire-building, acquiring more and more subordinates who create
an expanding workload for each other at greater and greater cost.
Since that is the time-honoured way of rising in organisations, the laws'
sparse effect is understandable. People who've got to the top by
empire-building are unlikely to do away with it, especially when they still
need their empires to sustain them.
But if the lack of action disappointed Parkinson, it wouldn't have surprised
him. He knew his first law's workings had been described well before, as
follows:
'It is apparent from the accounts alone that a number of persons wishing to
batten on the estates of the Treasury have invented titles for themselves
such as controllers, secretaries or superintendents, whereby they procure no
advantage to the Treasury but swallow up the profits.'
The quotation is from a British Museum papyrus dated AD 288.
