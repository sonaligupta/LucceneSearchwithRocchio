FT  28 JUL 92 / Directors keep pay details secret


   By ANDREW JACK


FEW BRITISH companies disclose details of their directors' pay packages,
according to an analysis by Company Reporting, the accounts monitoring
service.
Only 10 per cent disclose the amount paid to directors in bonuses and just 3
per cent show how these bonuses are calculated in spite of recommendations
on greater disclosure from the Cadbury Committee on corporate governance.
The study, which examined 440 accounts published during the past nine
months, found that 28 per cent of companies provided some information on
directors' earnings and that the figure was rising.
Some 19 per cent disclosed contributions to pension schemes on behalf of
directors, 10 per cent performance-linked incentive payments and 2 per cent
some other form of payment.
Company Reporting says that no company published the actual formula or
calculation used to provide directors' bonuses, which have come under
increasing criticism during the recession.
It says that among companies providing the most extensive information of
directors' bonuses are the Economist, the airports operator BAA, Boots and
Reed International. Some 5 per cent of companies - including Midland Bank,
RTZ, British Airways, Lonrho and Forte - disclose the earnings waived by
directors.
Company Reporting says BAA discloses auditor fees separately from other
services provided by its accountants. This is in advance of the introduction
of Company Act requirements to do so.
