FT  22 AUG 92 / Finance & the Family: Bank auction offers chance to buy
gilts - Preview of sale of long-dated government bonds


   By SARA WEBB


THE BANK of England is to auction Pounds 2.5bn of long-dated UK government
bonds on Wednesday. The issue, due for repayment in 2017, will pay an
interest rate of 8 3/4 per cent.
Private investors interested in a long-dated issue with a reasonable coupon
must make sure their applications are in by 10am on Wednesday.
Since the government's return last year to borrowing in the gilt-edged
market, the Bank has issued stock using such methods as taps and auctions.
Although the Bank does not have a set calendar for auctions, it tends to
hold them every two months or so.
The auctions are dominated by institutions and dealers, which usually buy
about 99 per cent of the stock. Private investors must complete an
application form.*
There are two ways of taking part - either with a competitive or a
non-competitive bid. Competitive bids are for investors, such as the
institutional buyers, who want Pounds 500,000 or more of stock.
Private investors who want to buy between Pounds 1,000 and Pounds 500,000
submit non-competitive bids. The amount they pay is determined by the
outcome of the competitive bidding and is the average allotment price
achieved.
If you want to buy between Pounds 1,000-Pounds 10,000, you must apply to buy
a multiple of Pounds 1,000. If you want between Pounds 10,000-Pounds 50,000,
apply for a multiple of Pounds 5,000. And if you want between Pounds
50,000-Pounds 500,000, your application must be for a multiple of Pounds
25,000.
The gilt issue being auctioned is partly-paid, which means you put up only a
certain amount at the time of the auction. In this case, you pay Pounds 40
for every Pounds 100 of stock for which you have applied. At previous
auctions, investors submitting non-competitive bids have received all they
wanted.
After the auction, the Bank sends out letters of allotment, plus a
registration form with details of the remaining amount to be paid on
September 23.
The stock being sold on Wednesday was created earlier this year to meet
demand from insurance companies for a 'super-long' gilt. You should
remember, though, that you can buy the same issue fully-paid in the gilt
market as Pounds 2.5bn was issued.
The auction stock is trading in the 'grey' (pre-issue) market and is about
1/16 of a point cheaper (on a fully paid-up basis) than the existing stock.
So, in terms of the stock price, you might not make a big saving by buying
at auction.
You could, however save on brokers' commission which you normally pay when
you buy gilts in the secondary market (although you can reduce the cost by
buying at the post office). If you buy a new issue at auction, there is no
commission.
*Application forms were printed in the Financial Times and the Daily
Telegraph on Wednesday. Additional forms are available from the Bank of
England, Registrar's Department, Southgate House, Southgate Street,
Gloucester GL1 1UW, tel. 0452-398-047 or 398-048; the Central Gilts Office,

bank's branches or agencies in Birmingham, Bristol, Glasgow, Leeds,
