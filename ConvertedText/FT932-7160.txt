FT  25 MAY 93 / International Company News in Brief: Rothschild US unit
chief steps down


   By PATRICK HARVERSON


   NEW YORK


MR ROBERT PIRIE is stepping down as co-chairman and chief executive of
Rothschild North America, the US unit of investment bank NM Rothschild,
after more than a decade at the helm of the New York-based firm, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
In his place, Rothschild is establishing an office of the chairman,
consisting of Baron David de Rothschild, the Paris-based group chairman, Mr
Gerald Goldsmith, the president and chief operating officer of Rothschild
North America, and two other senior executives, Mr Wilbur Ross and Mr
Yves-Andre Istel.
Mr Pirie, 59, said he decided to step down because, after 11 years as chief
executive, it was time to move on. He said: 'Any good actor ought to know
when to leave the stage.'
He would not be drawn on his plans but said he would remain in the same
business. Mr Pirie has agreed to stay on as a non-executive director of the
bank and Rothschild North America.
During his 11 years at the helm of Rothschild in New York, Mr Pirie was an
adviser to the Reichmann brothers of Canada, who built the Olympia & York
property empire, and Mr Robert Maxwell, the late publishing magnate.
