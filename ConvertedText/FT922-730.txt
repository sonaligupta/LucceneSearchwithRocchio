FT  26 JUN 92 / Refund on way for bank error


   By DAVID BARCHARD


A LETTER from the bank manager early next month will bring good news for
several thousand Lloyds Bank customers.
The bank has discovered that it overcharged some of its current-account
customers for overdrafts for up to five years, and 35,000 of its staff are
combing records to identify them and arrange a refund.
Lloyds said yesterday: 'The process will be completed by July 3 and in the
week after that each branch manager will send out a mildly embarrassed
letter to those customers affected. We think it will be only a tiny
proportion of our 4.5m current accounts.'
The bank said it did not believe it owed large sums to most of the customers
concerned because they were personal-account holders. It admitted that some
small business customers might have lost much larger amounts.
The mistake was simple. Some customers with agreed overdrafts were charged
as if they were unauthorised. Instead of paying between 16 per cent and 23.8
per cent, they were charged a punitive 34.4 per cent in interest.
Although a higher rate was being paid, the accounts were correctly labelled
as agreed overdrafts, so the customers did not pay transaction charges that
go with unauthorised overdrafts. As a result, many failed to spot that they
were being overcharged.
