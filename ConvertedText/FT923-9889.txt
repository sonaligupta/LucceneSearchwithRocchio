FT  03 AUG 92 / Pursuit of price stability may prove a fruitless task


   By EDWARD BALLS


FIXED EXCHANGE RATES may bring greater economic stability, although the
present turbulence within the European exchange rate mechanism suggests the
case is not clear-cut. They certainly produce headaches for politicians. As
the calls for a devaluation mount, and in the face of a persistently
stagnant economy, British government ministers have been driven to ever more
emphatic defences of the present parity and commitments to economic
austerity. Mr John Major's recently declared goal of reaching a zero
inflation rate by the next general election is the latest and most extreme
example.
The Euro-consensus around the desirability of 'price stability' may already
have passed its zenith. Yet even proponents of 'price stability' stop short
of advocating zero inflation as a serious goal for policy, being satisfied
instead with a measured inflation rate of between 0 and 2 per cent a year.
Even if the average price level is stable, improvements in the quality of
goods and changes in relative prices mean that any given basket of consumer
goods may well be rising.
Zero or negative inflation rates were once the norm. Money prices in both
the US and the UK in the 1920s were roughly the same as a century before.
More recent history suggests that Mr Major's target will prove elusive. Zero
inflation has been a rare occurrence for the world's most powerful economies
in recent decades. Germany has had zero or negative inflation rates for just
12 months in the past 30 years. Japan has managed just six months since
1970.
A positive inflation rate does not appear to have hampered Japan's growth
record. There is, in fact, no link between low or stable inflation and rapid
economic growth. Some countries fit the popular caricature: the UK has a
toothless central bank and a post-1945 record of high and variable inflation
and sluggish economic growth. But while countries with relatively
independent central banks - including the US, Japan and Germany - do tend to
have lower and more stable inflation rates, they are no more likely to have
high or stable growth rates.
Even successful independent central bankers appear willing to tolerate a
positive inflation rate. The Bundesbank, whose anti-inflation credentials
are unquestioned, has delivered inflation rates in excess of 2 per cent for
much of the past three decades. One reason is that, while inflation can be
costly, particularly if it is unstable or if savers cannot index-link their
capital, it may bring benefits, too.
The less compelling argument for a moderate and stable inflation rate is
that it acts as a lubricant, allowing companies to change relative prices
and wages without having to impose price and wage cuts. More important, a
positive inflation rate allows central bankers, if they choose, to cut
nominal interest rates to the inflation rate or below, making the real
interest rate negative. Companies can, in principle, cut nominal wages, but
nominal interest rates can never be negative, making inflation a
precondition of negative real rates.
When might negative real interest rates be desirable? When an economy is so
lumbered by accumulated debts that individuals are unwilling or unable to
spend and companies will not invest. The US economy has found itself in such
a debt trap, and the Federal Reserve has responded by cutting short-term
interest rates so far that real interest rates are now barely positive. Many
US economists argue that the Fed should go further and make short-term real
rates negative.
The UK economy is also abnormally burdened by debts. So the cost of trying
to achieve a zero inflation rate may be even higher than the half a million
more job losses that OECD calculations imply it would normally take to
reduce UK inflation to zero from its current level. UK short-term interest
rates remain above 10 per cent, implying real interest rates of 6 per cent.
With German interest rates unlikely to fall this year, the only route to
lower real rates in the UK would be through higher inflation. Lower
inflation may impede rather than speed recovery.
