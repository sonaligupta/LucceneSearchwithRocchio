FT  20 APR 94 / UK Company News: Expanding Asda Property lifts net asset
value by 42% to 111p


   By SIMON DAVIES


Asda Property Holdings, the property investment group headed by Mr Manny
Davidson, yesterday announced a 42 per cent increase to 111p in undiluted
net asset value per share over the 1993 year.
Pre-tax profits rose 4 per cent to Pounds 6.25m (Pounds 6.02m) despite the
impact on the previous year's figures of the sale of the residential
portfolio.
The company has been expanding at a rapid pace, acquiring Pounds 33m of
properties in 1993, partly funded by a Pounds 16.3m rights issue last July.
These properties achieved an average increase in value of 40 per cent at the
year end, compared with a 12 per cent increase from the existing portfolio.
Mr Davidson, chairman, said: 'The strong increase in investor demand in the
latter part of the year led us to change from an aggressive buyer to, in
some instances, an aggressive seller, with the consequence that borrowing is
at a lower level than may have been expected 12 months ago.'
Including the Pounds 14.9m of preference shares as debt, the group had net
borrowings of Pounds 72.1m, representing gearing of 83 per cent. Finance
charges dropped to Pounds 5.94m (Pounds 10.7m).
In December, it acquired the Wheatley Retail Park in Doncaster from the
receivers for Pounds 5.1m. The property was only half let, with income of
Pounds 450,000, but Asda has already boosted rental income to Pounds 1m.
Total net rental income amounted to Pounds 11.4m (Pounds 11.2m), while
profits on disposal of trading properties were Pounds 2.95m (Pounds 7.94m).
The rent roll is now running at Pounds 13m, and the company said that given
current voids, this figure could increase by a further Pounds 1m.
A proposed final dividend of 1.5p makes a total of 2.2p (2.1p), payable from
earnings of 6p (7.7p) per share.
