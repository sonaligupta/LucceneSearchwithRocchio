FT  27 JAN 94 / International Company News: Canadian airlines end two-year
battle


   By ROBERT GIBBENS


   MONTREAL


Air Canada has called off its two-year fight with rival Canadian
International Airlines, saying 'it is time for both of us to move forward
and focus on rebuilding our industry'.
In a statement, Air Canada said it is ending all litigation 'that would
preclude' PWA, Canadian's parent company, from concluding a CDollars 246m
(USDollars 187m) deal with AMR, parent of American Airlines.
AMR had insisted Canadian withdraw from the Gemini ticket reservation system
and join its own Sabre system as a condition of injecting CDollars 246m
equity.
But Air Canada, a co-founder of Gemini with PWA, maintained Canadian
Airlines was contracted as a Gemini shareholder until 1997.
Air Canada would not add to the statement. But the industry said it means
the court battle over Canadian's membership in the Gemini reservation system
is over.
At the same time Air Canada issued its statement, the federal government
said it will soon announce arrangements for Air Canada to get access to
Japan and Hong Kong - two destinations already served by Canadian.
Air Canada had failed to persuade the public that it should become the sole
Canadian international carrier and Canadian Airlines should 'concentrate on
the domestic market', said Mr Stephen Garmaise, analyst with First Marathon
Securities in Toronto.
'We'll continue to have two international carriers and Canadian may be ready
to pay CDollars 10m to CDollars 20m to exit from Gemini.'
PWA recently won renewal of CDollars 100m in government loan guarantees. A
deal with Air Canada and the equity infusion would allow it to move ahead
with a financial restructuring, with massive dilution facing existing
stockholders.
