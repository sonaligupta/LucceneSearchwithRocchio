SQUARE D, the Illinois producer of industrial control and electrical
distribution products and services fighting a takeover bid by Groupe
Schneider of France, reported first-quarter net earnings of Dollars 15.3m,
or 60 cents per share, a sharp drop of 44 per cent compared with last year's
Dollars 27.1m, or Dollars 1.09 per share.
Total first-quarter sales were Dollars 377.5m, down 3 per cent from Dollars
388.5m a year ago.
The company was hurt by recession in its key markets, in particular by low
demand for electrical distribution products due to a drop in housing starts.
It also took one-time charges of Dollars 5.3m in the first quarter for
consolidation of two lines of business.
Results were mixed from the company's international operations, with
improvements in Latin America being offset by declines in Canada.
Square D did not report any additional costs associated with its defence
against Schneider.
Mr Jerre Stead, the company chairman and chief executive, said Square D
started the year in a strong position and that with an improvement in
economic conditions, 'this will be another year of excellent financial
performance'.
