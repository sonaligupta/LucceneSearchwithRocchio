FT  07 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium problems hit Jamaican
bauxite earnings


   By CANUTE JAMES


   KINGSTON


Jamaica's 1993 bauxite production slipped by just under one per cent to
11.2m tonnes because of weak demand and the flatness of the aluminium
market.
There was, however, a 2.8 per cent rise in production of alumina (aluminium
oxide) to 2.98m tonnes, while exports of crude ore fell 1.4 per cent to
4.07m tonnes.
Jamaica is the world's third largest bauxite producer, after Australia and
Guinea, and the island's earnings from the industry, which are pegged to
international prices for aluminium, fell to Dollars 529m last year, Dollars
48m less than in 1992.
Mr Parris Lyew-Ayee, acting managing director of the institute, said that
Jamaica, like other bauxite producers, was suffering from the weak state of
the world aluminium industry, 'a high level of output of primary aluminium
in all the producing countries, and the reluctance of producers to curtail
production to correct the oversupply'.
