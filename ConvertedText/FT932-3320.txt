FT  15 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Ex-minister slams lease bill


   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent


MR MICHAEL Jopling, the former Conservative cabinet minister, told the
Commons last night that in spite of improvements made by the House of Lords,
the bill extending leasehold enfranchisement remained 'contemptible'.
MPs approved the bulk of the 300 amendments made by peers to the Housing and
Urban Development bill, including the introduction of a residency test for
the enfranchisement of leasehold flats in central London and other areas.
Mr Jopling, who was chief whip in Baroness Thatcher's first administration,
said in his 20 years as an MP he could recall no other piece of legislation
which made him so ashamed of the Conservative party than 'this wretched,
miserable bill'.
He maintained that by providing for the tearing up of agreements which had
been freely entered into the bill was contrary to the philosophy of the
Conservative party.
Mr Jopling insisted that the inclusion of a residency tests amounted to no
more than a 'modest improvement' to what he still regarded as an
unacceptable bill.
His objections were supported by Sir Jerry Wiggin (C Weston-super-Mare), a
former junior minister, and by Mr Geoffrey Clifton-Brown (C Cirencester and
Tewkesbury).
Sir George Young, the housing minister, described the residency test as a
'sensible compromise' between two conflicting points of view.
He told Labour critics that it would not 'substantially disenfranchise a
large number of people'.
Sir George said the new test was intended to prevent a majority of
non-resident long leaseholders purchasing their landlords' interests.
It would exorcise the spectre of control by an absent minority.
In accordance with the terms of another amendment made by the Lords the
title of the bill was changed to the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban
Development Bill.
