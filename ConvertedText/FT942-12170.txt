FT  30 APR 94 / Briefcase, Q&A: Warrants and CGT


I understand that warrants, if exercised, are not subject to CGT even if
they are bought for cash on the market. But what if warrants are bought and
sold on the market? Do I have to pay tax on any gain?
Listed warrants sold on the market are treated just like listed shares, for
CGT purposes. A cash profit is eligible for indexation relief; a cash loss
is allowable* without being increased by indexation unless the transitional
Pounds 10,000 relief applies.
Exercising a warrant does not produce any immediate CGT consequences, as you
say. When the shares are sold, they are deemed to have cost you the total of
(a) the cost of the warrant and (b) the amount paid on exercise; the cost of
the warrant (a) is indexed from the month of purchase to the month of
exercise, and then the total of that indexed figure and the amount paid on
exercise (b) is indexed from the month of exercise to the month of sale.
*If you buy warrants which eventually expire worthless, the cost is
allowable as a loss which is deemed to arise on the day of expiry.
