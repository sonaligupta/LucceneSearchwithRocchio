FT  23 OCT 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (5): A tax refuge
that offers flexibility and income - The experts' panel, Single-premium
investment bonds / It may be convenient to switch between funds, but Peps
have reinforced the unit-trust alternative


SINGLE-PREMIUM investment bonds are often referred to as the life assurance
industry's answer to unit trusts.
Their chief selling point used to be their tax status. The bonds pay
corporation and capital gains tax within the fund, but this means that the
investor's income tax is treated as having been paid. Therefore, no
basic-rate income tax, and no capital gains tax, need be paid on the lump
sum proceeds of a bond. It is also possible to withdraw up to 5 per cent of
the value of the original investment as income each year, with any tax
liability postponed until the bond is encashed.
Their other big selling point is flexibility - you can switch between
unit-linked funds within one bond, usually free of charge, making life much
easier than it is for those who wish to switch between unit trusts.
However, the introduction of personal equity plans (Peps) has made unit
trusts much more tax-efficient, while the high charges and commissions
associated with life assurance products also weigh down on single-premium
bonds. Do they still have a place?
David Harris, of Chantrey Financial Services, says it is difficult to
generalise, but points out that, according to an individual's circumstances,
there are still many cases in which the bonds can be useful as a
tax-planning tool. Charges and investment performance are the two criteria
he uses when selecting a company.
He says: 'The Scottish Equitable Bond has a low initial investment level of
Pounds 1,000 and will accept additional investments of Pounds 500. The
contract can be split into identical policies of only Pounds 100, which
could prove a useful tax-planning tool. The bond offers the facility to
invest in up to 13 funds, including an ethical fund and an index-linked fund
investing mainly in government securities. The majority of funds offered by
Scottish Equitable appear in the top quartile of investment performance for
medium to longer-term capital growth.
'The Skandia Life contract has a slightly higher minimum initial investment
of Pounds 3,000, and will accept additional investments of Pounds 1,000. The
major feature of this contract is its outstanding and unrivalled choice of
investment fund links. There are currently over 250 funds to choose from,
managed by the major investment management houses in the UK. There is access
to unit trusts, investment trusts, index tracker and building society funds,
and switching between funds may take place without administrative charges.
'Skandia Life also produce a comprehensive range of trust wordings, and the
bond may be used as the basis for specialist inheritance-tax planning
schemes or as a single-premium whole life policy for inheritance-tax
planning.'
John Bridel, of Towry Law, points out that Money Management, the
professional advisers' magazine, lists more than 1,000 different funds, so
that independent advice is essential.
He says: 'The majority of investment in the 1980s in this sector was into
accumulation funds, where the income earned from the capital investments is
accumulated on a daily basis and reflected in the unit price. Hence, if
withdrawals are made for 'income', then units are encashed and the number of
units held within the investment reduced. This is all very well when values
are increasing, but less attractive in a falling market.
'The most popular type of fund is the managed fund, where the managers
spread the investments between equities, property and fixed interest and
between various geographic sectors. Our current recommendation is Allied
Dunbar Managed, due to its consistent unit-linked performance.'
Mr Bridel also often recommends distribution bonds: 'These separate income
from capital so that, unlike accumulation bonds, withdrawals can be made
without encashing the units purchased by the original capital investment. In
addition, such bonds are often designed to produce an above-average income,
and invested in a portfolio including gilts and other fixed interest, income
shares of investment trusts and high-yielding equities. This is a relatively
defensive mix, and has done well over the last five years when stock market
returns have generally been disappointing. Our current recommendation is the
Sun Life Distribution Bond, which is a consistently strong high-income
performer and has defensive qualities.'
John Cole, Managing Director of Berry Birch & Noble, finds the allure of
investment bonds diminished.
'We are certainly recommending the use of investment bonds to our clients
less frequently than in the 1970s and early 1980s,' he says. 'The particular
attraction then was that the underlying investment in the bond could be left
to grow, with no additional income tax applying to a higher-rate taxpayer
until funds were withdrawn.
'Whilst all of these attractions remain, their importance has lessened as
tax rates have reduced and more tax-efficient areas, such as Peps and Tessas
have been launched. These days the performance of the underlying investment
has taken on a central role, rather than relying to such a large extent on
tax incentives.
'Switching can be a dangerous game, and it does not pay to be too
aggressive. Broadly-based managed funds have their attractions, and
certainly there are a number which have performed consistently well over the
years. The CCM Vanguard Fund through NM and managed by Capel Cure Myers has
been a top performer over more than 10 years and is one of our current
recommendations. Similarly, the Sun Life Distribution Fund has a creditable
long-term track record.
'Adaptations of investment bonds would include the Sun Alliance Protector
Bond, where investment is made in the top 100 UK companies with a guarantee
of returning at least the value of the initial investment after four years.
Then there is the Providence Capitol Building Society Bond, which offers a
variable rate of return linked to building societies but is currently
standing at a very acceptable 8.3 per cent, net of basic rate tax.'
Robert Noble-Warren, of Murray Noble, admits: 'I've always had a sneaking
affection for single-premium bonds, ever since I learned how easy it is for
them to transfer one's investment from one market to another. In times of
trouble, it seemed to me, it makes a lot of sense to keep your options open
and be able to scoot off to a safe deposit fund.
'Practically all single-premium bonds now offered by life companies provide
switching facilities like this, and the dealing costs are really very
reasonable. But it does not always work out in life like it says in the
brochure. I remember, over the October 1987 crash, trying to get a price for
some of our clients to move them to fixed interest. I was given the option
of dealing at the next day's price (which I had a horrible feeling would be
down 15 per cent), or next week's price (which, in the furore of the crash,
was outrageously far in the future).
'Today, almost every life company deals at the next (daily) valuation. This
gives them a certain advantage, which I'm not sure they always use with
total impartiality.
'Secondly, I appreciate the chance to use single-premium bonds in tax
planning. Where a client is on the borderline of not quite using all their
personal allowances, it is pleasing to be able to give them more income
without breaking their right to have a gross-paying building society
account. For retired couples, such withdrawals will not prejudice their
claim for old-age allowance (which is restricted when income rises above a
certain level).'
Mr Noble-Warren is also enthusiastic about their uses when held offshore,
for those who are taking up overseas employment. Proceeds can then be cashed
with no UK tax liability. Two companies which Murray Noble often uses for
this purpose are Albany Life and Clerical Medical International.
