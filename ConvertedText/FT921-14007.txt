BRISTOL-Myers Squibb, one of the world's biggest drugs companies, yesterday
turned in an 18 per cent rise in 1991 earnings.
Net income for the fourth quarter ended December 31 advanced about 20 per
cent to Dollars 510m or 98 cents a share from Dollars 425.5m or 81 cents a
year earlier. Sales in the three months grew 7 per cent to Dollars 2.94bn
from Dollars 2.74bn. Pre-tax earnings advanced 16 per cent to Dollars 703.7m
from Dollars 607.1m in the 1990 quarter.
For the full year, Bristol-Myers Squibb had net earnings of Dollars 2.06bn
or Dollars 3.95 a share, compared with Dollars 1.75bn or Dollars 3.33 in
1990. Sales rose 8 per cent to Dollars 11.16bn from Dollars 10.3bn. Pre-tax
earnings grew 14 per cent to Dollars 2.89bn from Dollars 2.52bn.
The results met most analysts' expectations, but the company's shares fell
Dollars  3/4 to close at Dollars 83 3/4 .
On Wall Street, investors have started shifting funds away from the
pharmaceutical sector in the past week as they search for better returns and
stock in the big pharmaceutical companies has come under selling pressure.
During 1991, Bristol-Myers sales were led by the US, where they rose 10 per
cent while international sales grew 6 per cent. Mr Richard Gelb, chairman
and chief executive, said almost all of the company's businesses posted
improved sales, excluding discontinued operations. Consumer products was the
only business sector to show a decline in sales.
The company last week said it would cut the prices of drugs it sold to
Federal programmes for veterans, the military and the Public Health Service.
