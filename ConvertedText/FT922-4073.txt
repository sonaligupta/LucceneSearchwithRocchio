FT  08 JUN 92 / Letter: No security compromise


   From Dr B WHARMBY


Sir, I would like to correct an impression given by Mr Hanson (Letters, May
22) that the licence condition derogation granted to National Grid for the
connection of the Grey-stones Power Station may compromise system security.
The derogation will allow output from Greystones to be sold into the
electricity pool before associated grid system reinforcements are complete.
The station will be able to generate at full output under normal grid system
conditions, but with a severely restricted output when transmission outages
occur. Arrangements will be made by National Grid for automatic reduction of
station output when required. Thus Greystones itself will be connected at a
reduced level of security. The remainder of the system, including
connections to other power stations and regional electricity companies, will
operate to the standards placed on National Grid by its transmission
licence.
Security of supply to customers will be unchanged by this arrangement, but
customers will stand to benefit from the earlier introduction of an
efficient power station on to the grid system.
