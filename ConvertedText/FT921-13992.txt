FT  18 JAN 92 / Russians bow under transferred prices burden: Neil Buckley
sees living standards collapse as subsidies end and market forces fail to
breach the gap


   By NEIL BUCKLEY


WHEN Russian president Boris Yeltsin was confronted in the city of Bryansk
this week by protesters complaining about the high cost of sausage, he gave
the instinctive reaction of a former communist. He accused the manager of
the sausage factory of sabotage and ordered his dismissal.
The incident highlights both the depth of unpopularity of the price
liberalisation undertaken by Russia and other former Soviet republics
earlier this month, and the difficulty of adjusting to a market economy for
a people that has known only a state-controlled economy for 70 years.
The price rises have become a national obsession in Russia. This week, they
have haunted Mr Yeltsin at every step.
Mr Yegor Gaidar, Mr Yeltsin's deputy prime minister responsible for managing
the economy, argues that the move is 'unavoidable', to reduce Russia's
budget deficit by removing the huge, and ever-growing, burden of subsidies
that the government has paid on goods.
'This measure was not adopted because we thought it would lead to a
blossoming of the economy or because we thought the shops would be full,' he
said, 'but because, in the present situation, we had no other room for
manoeuvre.'
Getting that message across to the Russian people, as their living standards
plummet, is not proving easy.
Mr Valentin Pavlov, then Soviet prime minister, first imposed administrative
price rises of 300 to 500 per cent on many goods last April. A fall in
production, and panic buying in expectation of further rises, contributed to
an inflation rate for the year of 200 per cent.
The combined effect of this and the recent price liberalisation has been
that many goods have increased in price by between 10 and 50 times in less
than a year. The average wage, meanwhile, has scarcely doubled, although
wages were freed along with prices and are expected to rise.
For the first winter since the Second World War, large sections of Russian
society are threatened by real poverty.
Under the headline 'We are now living as we did 45 years ago, and perhaps
worse' the newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta this week quoted statistics showing
that even before price liberalisation the standard of living in Russia had
dropped to 1946 levels.
What the paper calls the standard-of-living index, or the relationship of
the average wage to prices for a range of goods, has suffered a four-fold
drop in the last two years.
The cost of feeding a family of three children for one day is calculated to
have risen from Rbs2 in 1985, to Rbs18.6 in 1991.
Examples of the prices being paid by Russians for basic goods this week are
shown in the table. Their severity can easily be appreciated by comparing
them with the average manual workers' wage - around Rbs380 a month at the
beginning of January.
As the temperature plunged below minus 15 in south-west Moscow this week,
150 mainly elderly people queued in the snow for an hour or more to buy milk
at almost 10 times its old price. A little old woman hobbled out of the shop
with a jar of smetana (sour cream) for which she had paid Rbs14. Three years
ago the same jar cost 27 kopecks - there are 100 kopecks to the rouble.
'It's not worth going shopping with less than 1,000 roubles in your pocket,'
one woman commented. Another drew grunts of approval from the crowd as she
recalled Stalin's time, when goods were cheap and queues were short. 'Yes,
we lived well under Stalin,' she sighed.
The price rises are not confined to basic food or clothes. The cost of a
return air ticket from Moscow to London has risen from around Rbs2,000 to
Rbs57,000. The economy fare to New York is now Rbs96,000 - or more than 20
years' average wages.
There have, however, been reports from cities such as Yaroslavl and
Novosibirsk of prices falling after shops returned goods to the producers
because they failed to sell - the first, fleeting signs of market forces.
But ordinary Russians are not the only ones complaining. Some economists -
even those who supported market reforms in the Gorbachev era - have been
highly critical. Mr Nikolai Petrakov, a former economic adviser to the
Soviet president, wrote in Moscow News that it was 'obvious that the reform
process just begun has not been duly prepared, either methodologically or
organisationally. . . Such experiments demonstrate only contempt for
people.'
Market forces, the critics say, cannot really start to operate when so much
of the old system is still in place. Most state shops must still purchase
their wares from appointed 'wholesale' centres, or bazy. They are permitted
to add a mark-up, limited to around 25 per cent, out of which they pay their
costs and workers' salaries.
The bazy purchase from the producers - such as factories and state farms -
who also rake off a limited percentage.
It is, therefore, the producers who bear most responsibility for the level
of prices, and until producer monopolies are broken, the scope for price
reductions is limited.
There may be some, however. In his speech to the Russian parliament on
Thursday, Mr Yeltsin attacked producers for taking excessive profits,
sometimes of 200 to 300 per cent. He promised to limit profit margins of
enterprises to 50 per cent, and to speed up privatisation.
Mr Gaidar accepts the criticisms of his reform. But he is probably justified
in his claim that the need to cut the state budget outweighs all others.
However, price liberalisation is only the first step on a very long road. If
it is to travel that road successfully, Russia will need all the help it can
get.
