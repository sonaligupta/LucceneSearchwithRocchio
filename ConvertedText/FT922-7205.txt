FT  20 MAY 92 / Gulf states see first democracy forum

   KUWAIT


DEMOCRATS from five Arab states have set up the Gulf's first movement to
promote democracy and freedom of expression across a region where political
parties are banned, Reuter reports from Kuwait.
The Gulf National Forum (GNF), created at a meeting in Kuwait this month,
groups academics, businessmen and professional people from Saudi Arabia,
Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. It said it would act as
a public advocacy group to promote and defend human rights, democracy and
basic freedoms in Gulf Co-operation Council states.
Five Moroccan opposition parties have joined in a new bloc called the
Democratic Front ahead of general elections slated for this year.
