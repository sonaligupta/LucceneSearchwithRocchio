FT  15 APR 94 / Clinton objects to caning sentence by Singapore


   By GEORGE GRAHAM


   WASHINGTON


President Bill Clinton yesterday renewed his objections to a Singaporean
court's decision to cane a US teenager for vandalism, reports George Graham
in Washington.
Michael Fay, an 18-year-old student at Singapore's international school, was
sentenced to six strokes of the cane, four months in jail and a SDollars
3,500 (Pounds 1,500) fine for vandalism.
Fay is expected to appeal next week to President Ong Teng Cheong for
clemency over the caning, but diplomats say that Mr Clinton's repeated
interventions have drawn so much attention to the case that there is now
virtually no chance of Singapore over-turning the sentence.
Mr Clinton referred to the possibility of permanent scarring and said US
public opinion, overwhelmingly on Singapore's side, had mistaken the gravity
of the punishment.
