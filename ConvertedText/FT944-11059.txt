FT  08 NOV 94 / Observer: Rising sap


The Department of the Environment was struck with a severe dose of
time-travel indigestion yesterday. At 11.45 the central office of
information electronically informed the nation's newsrooms that John Gummer,
environment secretary, had given the go-ahead for two new community forests
in Cleveland and Nottinghamshire. The announcement, the CoI helpfully added,
had been made at the Association of County Councils' annual conference in
Leicester.
Three hours later - after Gummer's speech - a worried delegate asked about
forestry, a subject he had not mentioned. He coyly answered that he hoped to
make some announcements 'in the near future'.
