FT  26 MAY 93 / Amnesty attacks Egypt's record

THE Egyptian government's continuing battle against Islamic extremists has
led to a 'dramatic increase in human rights abuse,' according to a report by
Amnesty International, the London-based human rights group. It says Egyptian
security forces 'appear to have been given a licence to kill with impunity'.
The report follows Egypt's increasingly tough response to extremist attacks
against police and tourist targets, which Amnesty says has involved mass
arrests, torture, unfair political trials and death sentences.
Amnesty cites allegations of police killing Islamic suspects who were not
offering resistance, of torture in police stations and deaths in custody.
The Egyptian government has in the past year rounded up thousands of
suspected members of the Gama'a al-Islamiyya, the extremist Islamic group
behind a persistent campaign of attacks on police, government figures and
tourist targets which has led to an economically crippling wave of tourist
cancellations.
Amnesty puts the number of those detained under emergency provision, a
figure not released by the government, at 2,000 or more.
It says more than 160 people have died in the past year's political
violence.
