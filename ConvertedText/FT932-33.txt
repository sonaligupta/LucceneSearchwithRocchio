FT  30 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets: Israel


   By JULIAN OZANNE


   JERUSALEM


TEL AVIV scored a 6.7 per cent gain after the Treasury ruled out imposing
taxes on stock market profits, writes Julian Ozanne in Jerusalem.
The Mishtanim index rose 12.45 to 199.47, in heavy turnover of Shk237m
(Dollars 84.6m).
On Tuesday, the Mishtanim had fallen to its lowest level since last
November.
However, Mr Abraham Shohat, Israel's finance minister, ended months of
uncertainty on Tuesday evening, saying that he had decided to rule out a
capital gains tax to inject stability into Israel's capital market.
Mr Shohat also said that the imposition of a new tax would have hampered
government plans to privatise several state-owned companies by selling
shares to the public.
