FT  21 NOV 92 / International Company News: PepsiCo sells stake in Italian
snacks venture


   By NIKKI TAIT and REUTER


   NEW YORK, ROME


PEPSICO, the US soft drinks, food and restaurants group, said yesterday that
it was selling its 49 per cent stake in an Italian salty snacks joint
venture company, PIA, back to the majority owner, SME.
The US group gave 'differences in philosophy' over investment strategies for
PAI as the reason for the sale.
No figure was disclosed for the price at which SME, the Italian
state-controlled food retailing and catering group, is buying out the
interest, although PepsiCo said it would make a 'small gain on the
transaction'.
Some Italian press reports suggested that the price was around L20bn
(Dollars 14.5m).
The venture, formed in 1987, produced a mixture of PAI brands of potato
chips and corn snacks, and PepsiCo snack brands, like Cheetos, a
cheese-flavoured nibble, and BocaBits, a wheat-based product.
Explaining the split in investment philosophy, PepsiCo said that it viewed
the Italian market as 'one of great opportunity'.
The US company said it would plough ahead with the marketing of its own
brands in Italy, and introduce several new products via its snack food joint
venture with General Mills, another large US food company.
IRI, Italy's largest state holding company, said its board would meet today
to decide the future of food group SME, which is expected to be privatised,
at least partially, Reuter reports from Rome.
SME's stock was suspended last Monday by the bourse authorities pending an
announcement by IRI. The stock has soared in recent weeks on speculation the
whole group might be sold by public offer.
But the Italian Treasury Ministry recommended in a report released on
Thursday that the food group be sold in parts rather than as a whole to
bring in more money.
