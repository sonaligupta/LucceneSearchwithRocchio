FT  23 APR 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Plain fax on a thermal printer


   By DELLA BRADSHAW


Many companies are considering whether to replace their thermal fax machines
with plain paper models. Muratec, a subsidiary of Murata Machinery of Japan,
believes it has come up with the best of both worlds - a thermal fax machine
that prints on plain paper.
Because the F-70 uses inkfilm transfer thermal printing, in which the image
is transferred from the inkfilm to the paper, the costs are stable - 2.5p a
sheet. But the use of plain paper means the document does not fade, curl or
need photocopying before filing. Muratec: UK, 0737 780178.
