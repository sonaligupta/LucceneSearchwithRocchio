FT  07 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading


   By TERRY BYLAND


Another brisk day in the London derivatives markets saw unexpected support
from the US providing the opportunity for arbitrage trading in stock index
futures, writes Terry Byland.
Although well below the best at the close, the March contract on the
Footsie, at 3,424, was finally showing a premium of 20 points against cash,
and comfortably above the fair value premium estimated at 13 points. Volume
moved above 17,000 contracts after the official close of business.
After suffering heavily in early trading as London reacted to the overnight
fall in Hong Kong, futures were turned higher by the appearance of US
buyers, and at best the March contract touched 3,435, a premium of around 28
points to cash. Demand also came from the locals or independent traders, who
hinted at rate prospects despite the Bundesbank's refusal to budge.
Traded options were a little calmer, with 50,792 contracts done compared
with nearly 64,000 in the previous session. Business in the FT-SE contract
dipped to 9,801 from 14,165, and the Euro FT-SE recorded only 8,164.
Among the individual stocks, HSBC (2,590 contracts) reacted sharply to the
heavy fall in Hong Kong overnight. Food retailers traded actively, with
Sainsbury recording 1,216 deals and Tesco 4,397. Dixons (1,178) saw traders
reacting to the sharp fall in the shares following disappointing results.
Also busy were options in BTR as the market in the shares continued to take
hold of news that a senior board member had sold stock. Overall, the
preponderance of calls at 32,620 suggested an optimistic market.
