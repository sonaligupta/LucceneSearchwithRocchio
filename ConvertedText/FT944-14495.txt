FT  22 OCT 94 / International Company News: Poor sales hold back Kellogg


   By RICHARD TOMKINS


Another quarter of poor sales in the US held back profits growth at Kellogg,
the US breakfast cereal maker, in the three months to September. Net income
rose 4 per cent to Dollars 216.7m from Dollars 209.3m, lifting earnings per
share to 96 cents from 90 cents.
Kellogg said US cereal volumes were hit because it reduced promotional
spending on money-off coupons. However, it said the setback was more than
offset by solid results from Europe, Latin America and the Asia-Pacific
region. Sales rose 4 per cent to Dollars 1.74bn.
Kellogg, like other manufacturers of premium cereal brands, has been
fighting tough competition in its home market from cheaper products and
own-label brands. Earlier this year General Mills, Kellogg's biggest
competitor, switched strategy by reigning in promotional spending and
cutting prices by 11 per cent.
Kellogg has cut promotional spending, but is reluctant to win back market
share by cutting prices. Instead, it is using the money saved on promotions
to increase advertising.
Mr Arnold Langbo, chairman and chief executive, said: 'We are monitoring the
situation carefully, but continue to believe that the best way to achieve
long-term profitable growth is by introducing successful new products and
investing in brand-building advertising.'
One factor that should have helped Kellogg's US sales was the disruption
that hit General Mills when it discovered its cereals had been treated with
an unauthorised pesticide and had to throw away 50m boxes of cereal.
Kellogg has focused on growth overseas: 'We are particularly pleased that we
achieved volume growth in virtually every developing market around the
world, and are encouraged by the initial response to our products by
consumers in India, our newest market,' Mr Langbo said.
