NORSK HYDRO, Norway's biggest listed company, yesterday reported a NKr214m
drop in half-year net income to NKr788m (Dollars 133.61m), despite gains on
foreign currency and from the sale of securities.
Its performance was well below market expectations.
Second-quarter net income, however, rose by nearly NKr200m to NKr587m. The
group said: 'The second-quarter earnings benefited from a positive effect of
changes in currency rates, primarily the fall in the dollar and gains from
the sale of securities.' It recorded a second-quarter foreign currency gain
of NKr468m, against a loss of NKr322m last time.
Second-quarter net financial income was NKr374m, compared with a net
financial expense of NKr619m in last year's second quarter.
Hydro also made a second-quarter NKr213m gain from the sale of non-voting
shares in Saga Petroleum, Norway's biggest independent oil company, but
bought a similar number of voting shares. The company owns 12.3 per cent of
Saga's total share capital.
Second-quarter group operating income slid by NKr336m to NKr810m, while
operating revenue dropped by NKr298m to NKr15.386bn.
At the half-year, group operating income was NKr1.1bn weaker at NKr1.85bn as
operating revenue fell by NKr563m to NKr31.34bn.
Mr Egil Myklebust, president, said results were still affected by the weak
international economic situation, but 'we have seen some price increases for
light metals and petrochemical products during the first half of the year'.
He pledged that cost-cutting would continue with the aim of reducing costs
by at least NKr1.5bn within two years.
Mr Myklebust said some benefits of restructuring the group's fertiliser
business were already apparent, but he warned that the unit faced a falling
west European market and low-priced imports from eastern European countries.
The agriculture division saw second-quarter operating income tumble to NKr9m
from NKr338m last year as half-year operating income plunged to NKr204m from
NKr864m.
Second-quarter operating income for the oil and gas division was up NKr63m
to NKr722m, helped by a 200m tonnes of oil equivalent rise in oil/gas
production and slightly higher oil prices. At the half-year mark, the
division saw operating income increase by NKr36m to NKr1.460bn.
Second-quarter operating revenue rose NKr27m to NKr3.35bn but by NKr47m to
NKr6.66bn in the first six months.
