FT  30 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Domino declines 19% as US drive fails to
pay off


   By ALAN CANE


PRE-TAX profits at Domino Printing Sciences, the Cambridge-based continuous
ink jet printer maker, fell 19 per cent, from Pounds 4.58m to Pounds 3.73m,
at the half way stage in line with the warning in March.
Sales and gross profits were well ahead, but heavy investment in marketing
and distribution in the US had so far failed to pay off, according to Mr
Howard Whitesmith, group managing director.
Turnover for the six months to April 30 rose to Pounds 37.6m, an improvement
of 22 per cent on the Pounds 31m recorded last year. Earnings per share were
down 18 per cent at 9.35p (11.46p). The interim dividend is 2.65p (2.4p).
The balance sheet shows net cash of Pounds 16.4m.
Gross profits grew 21 per cent to Pounds 16.3m (Pounds 13.5m) but selling
and distribution costs rose 45 per cent to Pounds 8.31m, the result
principally of taking on an additional 14 sales people, together with
support staff, in the US in anticipation of a sales boom that had yet to
arrive.
Mr Whitesmith believed potential customers were delaying purchases while
they assessed the effect on business of the Clinton administration. He said
there were indications that the situation would improve in the second half,
traditionally the stronger part of Domino's business cycle.
Domino, together with Videojet, a US-based subsidiary of GEC, dominates the
world market for industrial ink-jet printers, used to mark sell-by dates and
batch numbers on a variety of foods, beverages and drugs. They are also used
to imprint part numbers on fast moving production lines. Domino has only an
18 per cent share of the US market compared with 55 per cent in Europe.
According to Mr Gerald Dennis, chairman, sales in the UK and France were
strong, but Germany and the Netherlands remained difficult. The boom in
ink-jet printing resulting from legislation in Europe demanding the
labelling of foods and beverages has now levelled off, and ink-jet printer
makers are seeking new outlets for their products.
The shares, which fell 44p to 552p on the March profits warning, rose 6p
yesterday to 469p.
