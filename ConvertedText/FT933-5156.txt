FT  04 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: News in Brief


GENERAL Portfolio Life Insurance has launched a Protected Equity Fund which
will be available across its product range, including life insurance and
pensions.
As with other guaranteed products, the fund will invest in cash and in
options on the FT-SE 100 Index. The cash is designed to ensure that after
three months, the unit price will have fallen by no more than 2.4 per cent;
the options will capture, on past experience, around 72.4 per cent of the
FT-SE 100 Index's rise. The FT-SE 100 Index does not account for dividend
income from the underlying shares.
Charges will vary depending on the product to which the fund is attached.
John Govett, which is managing the fund, takes 10 per cent per annum of any
increase in the underlying assets.
A guaranteed product is also on offer from the National & Provincial
Building Society. Guaranteed Equity Reserve IV allows the investor two
options. Option A is 100 per cent of the rise in the FT-SE 100 index over
five years (for basic rate taxpayers) or your money back. Top rate taxpayers
will get 80 per cent of the rise in the FT-SE; non-taxpayers 133.33 per
cent.
Option B gives the basic rate taxpayer 75 per cent of the Footsie's rise
with a guaranteed minimum gain of 25 per cent. Top rate taxpayers will get
60 per cent of the index rise; non-taxpayers 100 per cent. In neither case,
does the investor give any credit for the dividend yield on the index.
The minimum investment is Pounds 500. There are restrictions on withdrawals.
Abbey National is offering a range of fixed rate mortgages for house buyers.
The longest deal is a fix of 7.99 per cent (APR 8.4 per cent) until the end
of January 2000. There is a booking fee of Pounds 300 and a penalty of 210
days interest for early redemptions or capital repayments. The maximum loan
is 95 per cent of the value of the house up to Pounds 125,000; 90 per cent
over Pounds 125,000.
First time buyers can get 6.15 per cent (APR 6.5 per cent) until January 31,
1996, or 7.35 per cent (APR 7.9 per cent) until January 31, 1998. The
booking fee is Pounds 90 in both cases; there is a 90-day interest
redemption penalty on the shorter-term loan and an 150-day penalty on the
longer term loan.
The Leeds has also launched a range of deals. Existing Leeds borrowers
moving home can opt for a 6.99 per cent fix (APR 7.2 per cent) until
November 1, 1996. The arrangement fee is Pounds 195 and redemption premiums
are on a sliding scale from three months' to one month's interest.
Alternatively, existing borrowers can opt for a 1.75 per cent discount off
the variable rate (on loans of up to 90 per cent).
There is also a 'lifetime' fixed-rate mortgage at 8.99 per cent (APR 9.7 per
cent), which can range from between 10-25 years. The arrangement fee is 2
per cent of the loan, and there is a three month's early redemption premium.
First time buyers can opt for a 2 per cent discount off the variable rate in
year one, or a two-year deal, at 5.99 per cent in year one, and 6.99 per
cent in year two (APR 7.2 per cent).
