FT  27 OCT 92 / UK Company News: NFC


NFC, the transport and logistics company, has acquired, through its Exel
Logistics France subsidiary, two small French distribution companies for an
aggregate FFr44.5m (Pounds 5.5m).
Both companies specialise in the distribution of chilled foods and other
products in southern France. They will link with BOS Finance, acquired by
NFC last year, which operates in the north and west of the country.
Mr James Watson, chairman, said: 'This gives us a virtually national network
to build on for frozen and chilled foods'.
NFC is buying Transports Pujos, based in Toulouse, for FFr17.5m and
Transports Martin, in Nice, for FFr28m. Both are family owned and the
controlling shareholders will remain involved.
NFC has targeted continental Europe as its next growth area, now that an
acquisition programme in the US is largely complete.
