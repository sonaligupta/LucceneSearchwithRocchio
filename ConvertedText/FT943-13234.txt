FT  20 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Analysts differ on coffee price
prospects


   By RICHARD MOONEY


The coffee market is likely to continue its retreat from recent 8 1/2 -year
highs, according to London Trade house GNI. But FO Licht, a West German
commodity statistics consultancy, does not rule out a renewed price surge to
nearly double present levels.
At the London Commodity Exchange yesterday September delivery robusta coffee
futures, which peaked last week at Dollars 4,085 a tonne, fell another
Dollars 88 to Dollars 3,690.
In an article in its International Futures and Options Briefing GNI argues
that estimates of damage done to the 1995-96 Brazilian coffee crop by two
heavy frosts during the past few weeks 'have probably been exaggerated' and
that 'from a fundamental perspective' supplies of coffee over the next three
years were likely to be 'ample'.
In the shorter term it sees the Brazilian government's willingness, in
response to a surge in domestic prices, to liquidate its stockpile of 17m
bags (60kg each) as the most critical factor. With the world coffee market
effectively in balance in the 1994-95 season, Brazilian stock sales could
help consumer reserves to increase sharply to 23m bags, the highest level
since 1989-90, GNI calculates.
Worries about the possibility of further frosts and the fact that a clear
idea of post-frost output prospects will not be available until September
mean that 'only a minor (price) correction is likely over the next couple of
months', it says, suggesting that New York futures prices, which last week
topped Dollars 2.70 a pound, might fall from yesterday's Dollars 2.35 to
between Dollars 2 and Dollars 2.20. After that, however, near record exports
from producing countries are seen pushing prices as low as Dollars 1.40 a
pound.
'If there are no production problems in the following year,' says GNI, 'then
the impact of the low Brazilian crop on physical availability could cause
another mini-rally, but after the end of 1995 prices should fall again as
the roasters become more confident in the level of their reserves, probably
back to a normal Dollars 1.20 to Dollars 1.40 a pound range.'
Licht sees things rather differently. If it is true, as the US Department of
Agriculture has suggested, that a large proportion of Brazil's stockpiled
coffee is undrinkable, prices are likely to rise above the Dollars
7,000-a-tonne all-time high seen in 1977 after the worst ever Brazilian
coffee frost in 1975, the German consultancy says.
