FT  09 JAN 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries lose gains on auction news


   By PATRICK HARVERSON and SARA WEBB


   NEW YORK, LONDON


US BOND prices were virtually unchanged in late trading yesterday after
early gains had been wiped out by a disappointing auction of seven-year
notes.
By late afternoon, the benchmark 30-year government bond was unmoved at 107
7/32 , yielding 7.391 per cent. The two-year note was slightly firmer, up
1/32 at 100 21/32 , yielding 4.631 per cent.
Overnight, the long bond had weakened in Tokyo and London when news of Mr
George Bush's collapse at a dinner in Japan first broke, but confirmation
that the president was only suffering from intestinal flu helped calm the
New York market's nerves and prices soon rallied.
Attention subsequently switched to the afternoon auction of seven-year
notes, which was expected to go well. But when the sale was completed, bond
prices fell back as the market reacted badly to news that the seven-year
notes had been awarded to bidders at an average yield of 6.40 per cent.
THE European bond markets were dominated by activity in the Ecu sector
yesterday. Ecu bond prices fell after the launch of two large 15-year Ecu
bond issues - an Ecu 750m issue from the Republic of Finland with a coupon
of 8 1/2 per cent and an Ecu 400m issue from SNCF of France with a coupon of
8 3/8 per cent. The yield on the 9 1/8 per cent UK Ecu bond due 2001 moved
from 8.35 per cent to 8.41 per cent.
The German government bond market slipped on profit-taking. The Liffe bund
futures contract opened at 88.01 but after peaking at 88.04 fell to 87.68
and ended the day at around 87.80.
Traders reported some switching out of the Dutch government bond market into
French government bonds ahead of Friday's release of Dutch inflation
figures. Most analysts are forecasting a Dutch inflation rate of between
4.9-5.2 per cent for December.
STERLING weakness against the D-Mark and dollar yesterday prompted some
profit-taking in the UK government bond market and generally left gilt
prices lower or unchanged.
The Liffe gilt future, which opened at 97.15, slipped to 97.09 on an
above-average volume of 20,000 contracts. The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt
due 2003/07 ended the day almost unchanged at 115 5/8 .
JAPANESE government bond prices slipped lower as a weakening in the yen
against the dollar encouraged some profit-taking yesterday.
The financial markets had expected President Bush's visit to Japan to lead
to an agreement to boost the Japanese currency. But the yen weakened against
the dollar, from Y122.8 on Tuesday to Y124.7 in Europe yesterday, in the
absence of any such commitment.
The March futures contract fell from 103.32 to 103.24 while the yield on the
benchmark No 129 moved from 5.28 per cent to close at 5.32 per cent in
Tokyo. Traders noted some buying of the 20-year maturity bonds, and said
these appear cheap relative to the 10-year maturities.
Today, the Ministry of Finance is expected to auction about Y800bn of
10-year bonds.
