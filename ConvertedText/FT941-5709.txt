FT  04 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Restructuring of farms in
eastern Europe hindered


   By ALISON MAITLAND


Bureaucratic problems are hindering the restructuring of nearly 70 per cent
of farms in eastern Europe, according to a survey to be presented today,
writes Alison Maitland.
The survey of 2,000 farms in 10 countries in eastern Europe and the former
Soviet Union found that 35 per cent also faced financial difficulties in
adapting from communist methods, while 34 per cent cited social
restrictions, notably having to axe large numbers of farm workers.
The Farm-Trak poll by the Produce Studies Group, a European food industry
consultancy, will be publicised at the Agra Europe conference in Budapest.
Mr Tony Houghton, who will present the findings, said bureaucratic problems,
particularly over land ownership, were preventing long-term investment by
farmers.
More than 60 per cent of farmers also said that a shortage of suitable
machinery was impeding their progress towards greater efficiency, while over
50 per cent said that they were hampered by poor quality animal feed, a lack
of machinery spares and a shortage of skilled workers.
