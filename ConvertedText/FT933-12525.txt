FT  23 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Johnson Matthey scheme pays 458.08p per
share


   By CATHERINE MILTON


SHAREHOLDERS who took the cash alternative to Johnson Matthey's enhanced
scrip dividend scheme will receive 458.08p per share under a new type of
auction conducted by BZW Securities.
A total of 377,475 of the precious metals group's shares were auctioned to
institutions for a strike price of 459p, a 6p premium to the reference price
of 453p on which the scrip value was determined. BZW had previously promised
shareholders a 'floor' of 98 per cent of the reference price.
However, yesterday it also gave shareholders the benefit of 'best
execution', under which it passed on the benefit of any premium on the share
price over the floor. Shareholders thus received 101.32 per cent of the
reference price, minus BZW's commission.
BZW said the value of its cash offer was 10.77p per share, compared with the
enhanced scrip dividend of 10.65p and the ordinary of 7.1p.
Johnson Matthey's shares closed at 460p, up 7p.
Mr Michael Perry, BZW assistant director, said: 'It has been very positively
received. We had a comfortable volume of applications. It is a simple and
efficient process which benefited shareholders.'
