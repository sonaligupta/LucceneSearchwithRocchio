FT  23 JUL 94 / International Company News: Apple's third quarter tops
market expectations

   SAN FRANCISCO


Apple Computer yesterday reported higher-than-expected third-quarter
earnings, as sales of its new 'Power Macintosh' products introduced in March
advanced strongly.
Third-quarter revenues were Dollars 2.15bn, up 15 per cent on a year ago.
Net income for the quarter, before the effect of a one-time gain, was
Dollars 59.5m, or 50 cents a share. In the same period last year, Apple had
earnings of Dollars 10.6m, or 9 cents, before restructuring charges
totalling Dollars 320.9m.
Part of this charge was reversed in this year's third quarter, producing a
gain of Dollars 126.9m, or Dollars 78.7m after tax.
The company said it had modified and eliminated some of its original
restructuring plans due to lower-than-expected expenses and changing market
conditions. These plans had included moving certain operations to new
locations in the US.
Accounting for the effects of these items, net income for the quarter was
Dollars 138.1m, or Dollars 1.16 a share, compared with a net loss of Dollars
188.3m, or Dollars 1.63, in the third quarter a year ago.
Apple said it shipped more than 200,000 of its Power Macintosh personal
computers during the quarter, up from sales of 150,000 units in the second
quarter.
'We are pleased to see industry support building around the Power Macintosh.
More applications are arriving from software developers, and customer
response to this new industry platform has been very good,' said Mr Michael
Spindler, president and chief executive.
Increased sales of Power Macintosh, and the company's latest notebook
computers, helped to drive gross margins up significantly in the quarter, to
26.7 per cent of sales from 24.0 per cent in the previous quarter.
'Over the last quarter we have improved our financial model, controlled our
costs, and managed our working capital extremely well,' said Mr Spindler.
For the first nine months of 1994, Apple reported revenues of Dollars 6.7bn,
up from Dollars 5.8bn a year ago.
Net income after restructuring charges and reversals was Dollars 195.5m, or
Dollars 1.65 a share, for the nine months, compared with Dollars 83.9m, or
70 cents.
