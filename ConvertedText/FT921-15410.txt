FT  10 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canadian Wheat Board makes
record CDollars 740m loss

THE CANADIAN Wheat Board has blamed the US-EC subsidy war and bumper crops
for a record CDollars 740m loss on grain sales in the 1990-91 crop year.
Last year's loss, which is only the third since the board became the sole
marketer of prairie wheat in 1943, will be financed by the federal
government. This subsidy will bring total government payouts to Canadian
farmers to about CDollars 5.5bn this year, with the bulk directed at
hard-pressed grain producers.
The board, which accounts for about 20 per cent of world wheat exports, said
it has made every effort to concentrate sales on the few remaining
'commercial' markets not targeted by US and EC subsidies. But only an
estimated 21 per cent of world wheat trade was not directly influenced by
export subsidies last year. In any case, the board noted that 'as subsidies
increase, competition for the remaining non-subsidised markets becomes more
intense'.
It said that US discounts for milling wheat under the Export Enhancement
Program were as high as USDollars 64.55 a tonne last year. EC export
subsidies reached a peak of USDollars 191.50 a tonne.
The wheat pool ended the year with a deficit of CDollars 673.4m, compared
with a CDollars 208.2m surplus the previous year. The board fixed initial
payments to producers before the start of the season at CDollars 135 a
tonne, but selling prices fell short by an average of CDollars 30.34 a
tonne.
For durum, the shortfall was CDollars 69.6m, or CDollars 20.36 a tonne. This
is the first time that the durum pool account has been in the red. The
barley account suffered a CDollars 1m loss, although the board reported a
CDollars 27m profit on malting barley sales.
This season's initial payment to wheat producers is CDollars 95 a tonne. In
an effort to match producer prices more closely with volatile market
conditions, the board now announces its prices just days before the season
starts each August. The 1990-91 prices were announced in May 1990.
