FT  09 JAN 92 / Clash likely over legal-aid pay


THE row between solicitors and the government over legal-aid pay looks set
to come to a head at a meeting between the Law Society and the Lord
Chancellor tomorrow.
The society is to press Lord Mackay for an increase in legal-aid pay of more
than 10 per cent after rejecting the government's initial offer of a 1 per
cent increase.
It says: 'The basic increase in legal-aid pay rates must fully cover the
predicted rise in solicitors' overheads during 1992-93 and go some way
towards correcting the inadequate increases made in previous years.'
The evidence of the poor profitability of legal-aid work, increases in
overheads and a decline in the numbers of solicitors prepared to do the work
indicate that the legal-aid scheme 'has entered a spiral of decline which
must be checked', it says.
In a document sent to the government in support of its case, the society
warns that if this decline is not checked now there will not be enough
solicitors available to do legal-aid work in future.
