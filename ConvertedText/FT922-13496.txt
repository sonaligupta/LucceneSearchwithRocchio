FT  11 APR 92 / Letter: An imposter on the line


   From A PUGH-THOMAS


Sir, The prime minister (and Lord Skidelsky) must both have been misled by a
malignant spirit if they thought the former was speaking to John Maynard
Keynes ('Keynes here, how can I help you?' April 4); a gentleman of his
generation, particularly a stylist such as he, would surely have avoided the
fused participle when taking the PM's call - 'your hearing me' would came
naturally to his tongue. 'You hearing me' are clearly the words of an
imposter.
