FT  11 APR 92 / Briefcase, Q&A: A costly story


SINCE RETIRING I have written short stories and a novel as a hobby. I have
incurred substantial typing costs, as I cannot type. Now I have made a small
sale, which is greatly exceeded by the postal and typing costs I have
incurred in pursuing my hobby. How should I proceed taxwise?
If you were engaged in writing the story in question for more than two
years, you can claim to be treated as having become entitled to the recent
payment in three instalments:
one: two years before the actual payment date;
the second, a year before the actual date; and
the third, on the actual date.
If - as seems more likely  - it took you less than two-years-and-a-day, you
can claim to be treated as having become entitled to the payment in two
instalments:
one, a year before the actual date; and
the other on the actual date.
This relief is available under section 534 of the Income and Corporation
Taxes Act 1988.
In a reference library, look in the index of one of the larger tax books.
under 'copyright, assignment'. In anticipation of further sales, ask your
tax office for the free pamphlet IR28 (Starting in business).
