FT  13 APR 92 / France sidesteps Kurds issue


   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN


   ANKARA


ON the eve of his first official visit to Turkey, France's President
Francois Mitterrand has moved to stem an embarrassing controversy over his
wife's support for the Kurds, signalling his government's backing for
Ankara's Kurdish reform programme.
A week ago France, together with other EC members, criticised Turkey's
handling of recent Kurdish unrest, in which 100 demonstrators were killed in
clashes with security forces. Mrs Danielle Mitterrand, whose human rights
group, France Libertes, campaigns for Kurdish rights, is not accompanying
her husband.
But French officials are keen the Kurdish controversy should not cloud the
Mitterrand visit, the first by a French head of state in 24 years.
He is taking five ministers, including Mr Roland Dumas, the foreign
minister, who is expected to initial a new diplomatic protocol. Top of the
agenda will be security, in particular Turkey's role in the Caucasus and in
north Iraq, where French aircraft are using Turkish bases to provide
security for Iraqi Kurds.
In the past four years France has emerged as Turkey's leading investment
partner, with French groups taking strategic positions in the Turkish
cement, gas and insurance sectors.
