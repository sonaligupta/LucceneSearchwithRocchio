FT  20 JUL 94 / International Company News: Illinois Central takes over
rival


   By RICHARD TOMKINS


   NEW YORK


Illinois Central, one of the 12 biggest freight railroads in the US, is to
take over another of the biggest, Kansas City Southern, in an all-share deal
worth Dollars 702m, the two groups said yesterday.
The takeover comes less than three weeks after two other large railroads,
Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Pacific, said they planned to merge in a
deal worth Dollars 2.8bn.
The latest deal will bring together the 10th and 11th largest US railroad
systems and create a network spanning 14 mid-western and southern states. It
will link the markets of Chicago, New Orleans, Memphis, Kansas City, Port
Arthur, Dallas and Birmingham.
Kansas City Southern is being sold by its parent company, Kansas City
Southern Industries, because the parent wants to concentrate on its non-rail
activities in the financial services sector. It plans to spin off these
businesses - mainly the DST Systems data processing operation and the Janus
Capital fund management business - through a free distribution of shares.
The parent company had announced the railroad was for sale in May. Companies
thought most likely to buy it were Burlington Northern, Santa Fe Pacific and
Illinois Central, but Burlington and Santa Fe put themselves out of the
running by deciding to seek a merger with each other.
In exchange for the railroad, Kansas City Southern Industries' shareholders
will get 21.2m Illinois Central shares, which were trading yesterday morning
Dollars  1/8 down at Dollars 33 1/8 . Illinois Central will assume Dollars
929m of Kansas City Southern Industries' debt.
If approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission, a federal regulatory
body, the takeover will vie with the Burlington/Santa Fe deal to become the
biggest railroad merger since a wave of consolidations took place in the
late 1970s and early 1980s.
The Illinois/Kansas City merger is less likely to face anti-trust objections
than the Burlington/Santa Fe deal because it is considerably smaller, but
neither deal is likely to win approval until next year.
US freight railroads have been enjoying a renaissance caused by a
combination of growth in the US economy, big increases in efficiency and
productivity, and a shortage of capacity in the long-distance trucking
industry caused by driver shortages.
The logic for railroad mergers is that it gives their customers better
service to an increased range of destinations without costly delays at the
borders between different company's networks. The increased traffic density
can usually be accommodated without a matching increase in costs.
