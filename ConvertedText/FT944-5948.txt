FT  01 DEC 94 / Technology: Printer, copier and fax


   By GEOF WHEELWRIGHT


A second generation of combined computer printer, photocopier and fax
systems is on its way. Hewlett-Packard, the US computer maker, has launched
an OfficeJet system for the home, home-office and small-business user.
It is the first time a leading manufacturer has produced an inkjet
multifunction printing system. Previous efforts have been built around more
expensive laser printer technology and have often been more expensive to buy
than purchasing the individual components separately.
The HP OfficeJet was launched in North America last month and will be
released in Europe early next year. It is expected to sell for less than
Pounds 1,000 (it sells in the US for slightly less than Dollars 1,000) and
offers the ability to provide high-resolution printed output, to send and
receive faxes and to photocopy.
The price is still slightly more than the cost of buying the cheapest
equivalent components individually, but Hewlett-Packard is hoping that users
will be willing to pay a premium for a device that the company claims is
more than the sum of its parts.
Hewlett-Packard is using the same inkjet printing technology on the HP
OfficeJet as on the company's popular DeskJet inkjet printer range. It
promises 600 by 300 dot per inch printing resolution and uses HP's
Resolution Enhancement technology - which is designed to vary the size and
placement of the dots produced by the printer to smooth curves and edges on
individual char-acters.
The OfficeJet has a 24-page memory that enables it to store up to 24 pages
of faxed material even when it runs out of paper. It can print out stored
pages while receiving other pages.
When used as a photocopier, HP says, the OfficeJet is suitable for small
printing jobs - and it has document reduction capabilities.
