FT  16 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading


   By JEFFREY BROWN


Stock index futures moved narrowly in low volume, with trading mostly
underpinned by profit-taking on the back of Wednesday's strong gains, writes
Jeffrey Brown.
The FT-SE 100 December contract, which expires this morning, stood at 2,974
at the close of pit trading, down four points. The March contract was three
points easier at 2,994.
The December contract was right in line with the cash market, while March
closed at a 19-point premium - broadly in the middle of dealers' range of
fair value premiums.
In contrast to Wednesday when the session was marked by steady buying,
activity was flat, with less than 15,000 contracts traded and substantial
spread trading into the March contract.
Where there was business it was mostly generated by profit-taking, although
expiry influences and year-end book adjustments were clearly also factors at
play. The best of the day for the March contract was 3,019.
Option turnover was also dull, tailing away to 30,666 lots from 43,329 on
Wednesday. Put volume had the edge on calls, while FT-SE and Euro FT-SE
trading accounted for just under 22,000 contracts.
Abbey National was the most active stock option, followed by Scottish Power
and Cadbury-Schweppes. Abbey National saw 2,020 lots transacted.
