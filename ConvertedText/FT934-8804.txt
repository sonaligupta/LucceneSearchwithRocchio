FT  13 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Currency exchange prices do not seem
so fair


   From Mr ALAN EAMES


Sir, 'Fair prices at Heathrow', proclaims the British Airports Authority,
and 'Our airport Bureaux de Change now gives you the best all round deal'.
Ha ha. DM100 changed at Heathrow Terminal 2 on November 5 gave me a net
Pounds 35.06 at a rate of 2.6625 (versus FT close average rate of 2.515),
minus Pounds 2.50 commission. Is it not time steps were taken to reduce
those excessive currency transaction profits? No wonder financial and other
institutions are so against a single currency for Europe.
