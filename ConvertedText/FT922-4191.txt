FT  06 JUN 92 / Motoring: A truly super Trooper


   By STUART MARSHALL


'GRANDPA'S van]' exclaimed (not quite) two-year-old Sophie, the apple of my
eye, as the Isuzu Trooper crunched to a halt on the gravel drive of
Honeysuckle Cottage in darkest Dorset.
I knew what she meant. The high roof that lets this big 4x4 estate carry
five people in some luxury - and two more sitting sideways without serious
squashing - does give it a slightly commercial look.
But none of the current crop of recreational four-wheel drives could really
be less van-like than the 3.1 litre turbo-diesel engined Trooper LWB Duty I
drove for more than 600 miles (1,000 km) during a weekend last month.
Independent front suspension (a feature found in only one class rival, the
Mitsubishi Shogun) makes it ride and handle more like a car than an on-off
road vehicle.
Clutch and 5-speed gearshift are as light as a small hatchback's and the
steering is effortlessly power-assisted.
The engine, like the smaller Isuzu turbo-diesels used in the Vauxhall Nova
and Cavalier, is a gem. It is almost as quiet as a Mercedes diesel  - praise
comes no higher - and vigorous enough to let this big 4x4 keep up easily
with the motorway pack. Yet it gave me 27 mpg (10.46 1/100 km) over 620
miles (1,000 km). This included a 151-mile (243 km) journey, mainly on motor
ways but with some A and B roads, in 150 minutes, an average speed of
exactly 60 mph (96 kph).
The Trooper's excellent economy is helped by quite high gearing (25
mph/40kph at 1,000 rpm in top) and selectable four-wheel drive. On road,
only the rear wheels are driven; the front ones free-wheel on hubs that lock
automatically only when four-wheel drive is engaged.
At Pounds 17,998 the Trooper LWB turbo-diesel is the same price as the 3.2
litre V6 petrol model. It is comprehensively equipped and I rate it a best
buy in its class.
For Pounds 2,200 more there are Citation versions (pictured) with extra
goodies such as alloy wheels, ABS brakes and air conditioning.
