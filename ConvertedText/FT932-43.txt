FT  30 JUN 93 / Survey of Italy (7): Progress at a snail's pace - Haig
Simonian monitors the ambitious privatisation programme


   By HAIG SIMONIAN


ALMOST 10 months ago, Italy's government surprised the stock market, foreign
multinationals and many of its supporters by announcing an ambitious
privatisation programme for the next three years.
Since then, Bonn has put forward plans to sell off state assets, London is
going ahead with the disposal of the remaining stake in British Telecom,
while the new French government has knocked the wind out of investors with
the speed and scope of its privatisation plans.
Italy, in the meantime, has appeared to stand still. The same companies are
still for sale; timetables, which looked ambitious to begin with, are
regularly repeated but never revised; only ministers' faces have changed.
What has gone wrong?
The delays involve party politics, economic fundamentals, and just plain
donkey work. The upshot is that, although some deals are approaching
conclusion, many more are barely on the starting line.
However, the impression of inactivity masks some genuine progress. The
previous government of prime minister Giuliano Amato, which set the
privatisation ball rolling, made a start on overcoming many of the toughest,
but least visible, obstacles to disposals.
Foremost among them was political consensus. While the need to sell assets
to bring down the budget deficit was widely accepted in the government and
ministers were broadly agreed that privatisation was one instrument in going
about it, consensus ended there.
Opposition to disposals took two forms - the second sometimes masquerading
as the first. Some ministers, notably Mr Giuseppe Guarino, who held the key
industry portfolio, argued privatisation should be prepared in the context
of a broader 'industrial policy' for the state.
Some companies on the privatisation list, such as Finmeccanica, the
engineering arm of the IRI state holding company, have huge investment
programmes entailing long lags before profits start to show. The risk of
privatisation, according to the critics, was that essential, but potentially
unattractive, long-term investments or research projects, vital to keeping
Italy abreast in the high-technology race, might be pruned by new
private-sector owners. Rather than pushing ahead with piecemeal
privatisations, they argued the government should first work out a list of
strategic priorities.
The second barrier to sell-offs was much more self-centred. State-sector
companies have been important sources of political patronage for decades.
Their boards have been stacked with political placement. As the corruption
scandal shows, some were also crucial milk cows for the political parties.
Such territory is not easily relinquished by politicians accustomed to
treating the symbiosis between parties and state enterprises as a fact of
political life.
Mr Amato also had to overcome organisational difficulties. Big
privatisations require months of groundwork by lawyers, bankers and
accountants. Some laws also had to be changed to eliminate monopolies and
alter tariff structures. And the legal status of the biggest public-sector
concerns also had to be amended.
Hence the privatisation of IRI, Eni (energy and chemicals), Ina (insurance)
or Enel (electricity generating) could not advance until all were
transformed into joint stock companies, producing normal balance sheets and
with an arm's-length relationship to the state.
The completion of much of the groundwork by Mr Amato and the presence of a
more homogeneous team of ministers under Mr Cimapi means disposals should
now gather speed. Few doubt Mr Ciampi's determination, unequivocably
expressed in speeches on cutting the deficit during his term as central bank
governor.
Political opposition has also diminished as many MPs have become discredited
by the corruption scandals. Meanwhile, pro-privatisation parties, such as
the Northern Leagues, have been gathering strength.
The process has also been helped by the progressive 'de-politicisation' of
the big state companies, reducing internal resistance. Boards of directors
have been slimmed down for faster decision-making. Revelations about the
payment of kickbacks has made the management renewal process faster and less
painful than expected.
Most of the delays are now market-related rather than political. Recession
has eroded the number of buyers for many assets. Mr Franco Bernabe, Eni's
managing director, has recognised disposals are likely to be easiest when
limited to small companies or plants, rather than wholesale divisions. As a
result, leading newspapers have been peppered with modest advertisements,
rather than full-page blockbusters, offering individual Eni units for sale.
Falling earnings have also dulled the attractions of many big state-owned
banks and companies. Italy's financial institutions, once avidly courted by
big foreign banks wanting to expand abroad, have lost much of their lustre
now that profits are down.
Changing corporate priorities have not helped. The focus among banks on
cross-border financial services in the run-up to the European Community's
1992 liberalisation prompted a scramble to buy financial services companies
in neighbouring countries. Little was for sale in Italy at the time. Now the
supply has increased, but demand has withered as bankers have realised
managing financial services abroad is no easy matter.
Luck also plays a part. Some disposals, such as the treasury's stake in the
Crediop long-term lending agency to the San Paolo banking group, went
through smoothly before Mr Amato came to power.
By contrast, talks to sell the treasury-controlled IMI financial services
group to a pool of big city savings banks fell through this month, nearly
three years after first being mooted. The sale of the banks, led by Milan's
Cariplo, was forecast to raise about L3,500bn. Now, plans for IMI will have
to be revised, with the treasury envisaging a flotation instead.
To cap it all, Italian business remains overshadowed by the corruption
scandal. Many foreign buyers are keenly aware of the prospects in retailing
or insurance. But most are hanging back until the corruption scandal dies
down.
Domestic constraints must also be tackled for privatisation to proceed
smoothly. The Milan stock market remains relatively small and illiquid,
despite recent financial reforms. The lack of potential domestic investors
has made ministers, fearing a flop, wary of big flotations for the first,
pace-setting privatisations.
Both the Amato and Ciampi governments must take some of the blame for not
doing more to develop the bourse as part of the overall privatisation
process.
Most recently, the government approved a proposal by the Bank of Italy to
allow banks to buy up to 15 per cent of the shares of industrial companies
in an important revision of the outdated 1936 banking law. Although easing
the privatisation process was not the main motive, letting banks buy into
public-sector companies due to be sold was undoubtedly an influence on
policy-makers.
For its critics, however, the proposal represented nothing more than a
veiled 'nationalisation'. The banking system is dominated by public-sector
institutions, which may end up taking significant stakes in state-owned
companies now being 'privatised'. Such an approach was understandably
derided by those calling for a 'true' privatisation policy.
In fact, the main reason for the reform was to ease debt problems among
private-sector companies suffering in the recession. But given the
apparently snail's pace of Italy's privatisation programme, the cynical
reaction was not altogether surprising.
