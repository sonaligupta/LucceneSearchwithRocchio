FT  25 MAY 93 / International Company News in Brief: Saks Fifth Avenue


   By NIKKI TAIT


MR PHILIP MILLER, currently chief operating officer at Saks Fifth Avenue,
the upmarket US stores group, is to become chairman and chief executive at
the end of June. Mr Miller, who ran Chicago-based Marshall Field, when it
was owned by Britain's BAT Industries, will replace Mr Melvin Jacobs who is
retiring, writes Nikki Tait.
Saks was also owned by BAT until 1990, when it was bought out by Investcorp,
an Arab-led investment consortium.
