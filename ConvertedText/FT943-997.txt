FT  27 SEP 94 / Algerian radical leader shot dead


   By FRANCIS GHILES


Algerian security forces shot dead Mr Cherif Gousmi, leader of the country's
most feared fundamentalist group, the Islamic Armed Group (GIA) in Algiers
yesterday, Francis Ghiles writes.
The GIA leader whose nom de guerre was Abou Abdallah Ahmed had reiterated
his movement's opposition to any dialogue with President Liamine Zeroual
after two leaders of the banned Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), were
transferred from jail to house arrest two weeks ago.
The GIA has claimed responsibility for the murder of most of the 60
foreigners killed in Algeria in the past year, and has burned down more than
300 schools and threatened to murder teachers working for 'an impious
state'.
Its campaign against intellectuals claimed another victim yesterday when a
lecturer at the Economics Faculty of Oran, Mr Abderrahmane Fardeheb, was
shot and injured.
Analysts agree that the violence unleased by the interruption of elections
the FIS was poised to win in January 1992 has cost 28,000 lives, two-thirds
lost since last November after three French consular officials were
kidnapped.
