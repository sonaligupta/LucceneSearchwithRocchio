FT  12 NOV 92 / Government Bonds: Bund dealers sceptical over rate cut
prospects


   By SARA WEBB


GERMAN government bonds ended lower, led by a fall in short-dated issues as
the bund market appeared increasingly sceptical over prospects for a
near-term cut in interest rates.
The Bundesbank left interest rates unchanged at 8.75 per cent in yesterday's
securities repurchase tender, dampening hopes of a cut in official interest
rates. The central bank drained a net DM5.7bn of liquidity from the money
market, but dealers said the drain was 'technical' rather than an indication
of Bundesbank policy.
Dealers said short and medium-dated issues showed the biggest falls, with
investors taking profits in the five-year area where the gains have been
strongest in recent days. They also noted some extension trades, with
investors switching from five-year to 10-year bunds.
The Liffe bund futures contract fell from a high of 91.57 to end at 91.47
while the DTB's December Bobl future fell from Tuesday's close of 96.06 to
95.90.
THE UK government bond market ended lower at the long end, but activity was
subdued ahead of Chancellor Norman Lamont's Autumn Statement.
Short-dated gilts traded in a narrow range and ended little changed or
weaker, although dealers said the short-end was underpinned by hopes of a
base-rate cut and a 'bond-positive' Autumn Statement.
The Liffe gilt future contract fell from the opening of 102.12 to 102.01 by
late afternoon on average volume.
Long-dated issues rallied initially, allowing the Bank of England to sell
the remainder of its Pounds 1bn tap stock, the 8 per cent gilt due 2009
which was announced last Friday.
The 9 per cent gilt due 2008 ended at 104 1/32 , down from 104 7/32 , to
yield 8.52 per cent while the 9 3/4 per cent stock due 2002 fell from 111
1/2 to 111 7/16 .
ELSEWHERE in Europe Italian government bonds closed higher on hopes of a cut
in official interest rates, following the easing in money market rates. The
Liffe December BTP contract ended up 40 basis points at 94.88.
JAPANESE government bonds jumped in afternoon trading as a drop in the stock
market rekindled hopes of an interest rate cut.
The rally was mainly in the futures market with the March contract, which
acquired benchmark status on Tuesday, rising from 107.26 to end at 107.49.
In the cash market, the yield on the No 145 moved from 4.655 per cent at the
opening to close at 4.625 per cent.
The Nikkei index fell 118.96 points to end at 16,318.15, leading to
speculation in the bond market that the Bank of Japan may be forced to ease
monetary policy and cut the Official Discount Rate.
US bond markets were closed for the Veterans' Day Holiday.
