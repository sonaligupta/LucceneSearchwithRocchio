FT  08 NOV 94 / Ferry ban cuts calf prices by up to 40%


   By ALISON MAITLAND


Calf prices have fallen by 30 per cent to 40 per cent in some markets in
south-west England as a result of Brittany Ferries' decision on Friday to
join a ban by cross-channel ferry companies on exporting animals for
slaughter.
Sir David Naish, president of the National Farmers' Union, said he was
concerned about market prices, which had already fallen by 15 per cent
year-on-year since P&O and Stena Sealink banned live exports in the summer.
Brittany Ferries, which had continued to carry animals for further fattening
before slaughter, said last week it was halting this trade because of
'flagrant breaches' by hauliers of its code of conduct.
Sir David has written to Mr Rene Steichen, EU farm commissioner, saying
European-wide rules must be introduced urgently to control cowboy hauliers.
Mr William Waldegrave, agriculture minister, yesterday said efforts
continued to finalise proposals which would strengthen the law and introduce
a code of conduct for hauliers and farmers.
