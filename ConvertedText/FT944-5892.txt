FT  01 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Kleinwort Benson buys 20% of Chicago fund
manager


   By SIMON LONDON


Kleinwort Benson, the investment banking and fund management group, is
taking a 20 per cent stake in LaSalle Partners, the Chicago-based property
fund manager.
Kleinwort's existing joint venture in real estate fund management, 50 per
cent owned by Alex Brown, the US investment bank, will be merged with
LaSalle to create the third largest property fund manager in the US.
The group is paying Dollars 20.8m (Pounds 12.6m) for its stake in LaSalle
and Dollars 10.6m to buy out Alex Brown from the joint venture.
Mr Gary Thomas, finance director of Kleinwort Benson investment management,
said: 'Our joint venture with Alex Brown was a good investment, but it is
clear that the business was too small to provide the high level of service
demanded by investors over a long period of time. We had to decide whether
to invest in that business or strike a deal with someone else.'
The joint venture with Alex Brown had Dollars 3bn of property under
management, against La Salle's Dollars 9bn.
Kleinwort Benson has the right to maintain its holding in LaSalle at 20 per
cent by acquiring additional equity in the company up to a maximum
additional cost of Dollars 12.2m.
Mr Thomas added that the group has been expanding its US fund management
operations including Fenchurch Capital Management and Kleinwort Benson
Investment Management Americas.
