FT  28 MAR 92 / International Company News: Paribas expects loan-loss
provisions to remain high

PARIBAS, a leading French investment banking group, yesterday announced that
it expected provisions to remain high this year because of the poor economic
outlook in France and the UK.
Paribas was forced last year to make a special provision of FFr2.8bn, mainly
due to its exposure on loans made by its Paribas Suisse subsidiary. Most
were property loans although it was also exposed to the collapse of Mr
Robert Maxwell's media empire.
Mr Andre Levy-Lang, chairman, yesterday warned that Paribas faces another
year of high provisions in 1992.
The group also confirmed an earlier forecast that it had slipped from net
profits of FFr2.54bn (Dollars 448.7m) in 1990 into a net consolidated loss
of FFr184m in 1991.
Meanwhile, the banks within the Paribas group were forced to raise their
provisions by 28 per cent to FFr6.3bn because of the adverse environment in
France, the UK and, to a lesser extent, the rest of Europe.
'The trend in France during the opening months of 1992 has not been good
because of weak demand,' said Mr Levy-Lang, emphasising Paribas' concern
about the effect of the economic slowdown on small companies.
He added that the situation in the UK, where the Compagnie Bancaire unit is
active in the consumer loans and mortgage market, was clouded by recession
and uncertainty over the general election.
When Paribas forewarned of the increase in provisions in January, it was
placed under surveillance by Moody's and Standard & Poor's, the US credit
rating agencies, with a view to downgrading.
Mr Levy-Lang admitted it was possible the group could be downgraded, but
said he would not expect it to have a 'marked negative effect'.
He warned that the banking sector faced fierce competition and pressure on
margins, and Paribas planned to counter this by continued cost-cutting and
possibly by selling some of its investments in 1992 and 1993.
