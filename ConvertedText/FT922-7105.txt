FT  20 MAY 92 / No accord in Moscow with IMF

   MOSCOW


A TEAM from the International Monetary Fund is to leave Moscow without
agreeing the first draft of a Russian economic reform programme which would
unlock the Dollars 24bn promised by the west because key details remain
unresolved, writes Leyla Boulton in Moscow.
The Russian government had hoped to agree a letter of intent with the Fund
by today so that the final standby programme could be ready in time for
President Boris Yeltsin's meeting with Group of Seven leaders in Munich on
July 6-7.
The visiting IMF officials are understood to have told the Russian
government that despite progress - including moves to liberalise internal
oil prices - more work needs to be done.
