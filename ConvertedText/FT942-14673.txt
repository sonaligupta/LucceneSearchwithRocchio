FT  19 APR 94 / International Company News: Nabisco finalises takeover


   By JOHN BARHAM


   BUENOS AIRES


RJR Nabisco, the US food and tobacco group, has finalised its takeover of EM
Terrabusi SA, one of Argentina's biggest food companies, after a long
courtship.
Terrabusi recorded sales of Dollars 242m last year, a 25 per cent increase
over 1992, while its pre-tax profit rose 69 per cent to Dollars 12.9m. It
holds one-quarter of the big cookie and cracker market and has Argentina's
best-selling pasta brand.
Nabisco bought 70 per cent of the company from members of the controlling
family. The remainder is still held by the public. Neither side disclosed
the value of the transaction, but analysts in Buenos Aires believe Nabisco
paid between Dollars 245m and Dollars 250m.
This was the largest takeover of a private company by a multinational since
Argentina embarked on a market-oriented stabilisation programme in 1989.
The last year has seen a surge in acquisitions by companies from the US,
Europe, Chile and Brazil. Buyers have focused on the food industry because
Argentina is a large, low-cost agricultural producer.
