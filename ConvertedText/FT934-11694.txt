FT  29 OCT 93 / Opposition says parliamentary elections will not be fair


   By REUTER


   MOSCOW


Parliamentary elections ordered by President Boris Yeltsin will not be fair,
but they are the last chance for democracy in Russia, a liberal opposition
leader said yesterday, Reuter reports from Moscow.
'These elections are a far cry not only from democracy, but even from simple
logic,' said Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, a prominent economist and leader of a
large electoral bloc opposing Mr Yeltsin. 'But realising this we still feel
we have no way other than to take part in elections even under their dubious
rules,' he said.
Mr Yeltsin has ordered elections to the State Duma, the lower chamber of a
new-style legislature called the Federal Assembly, for December 12, with
presidential elections to follow six months later.
