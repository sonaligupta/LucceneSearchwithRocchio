FT  22 OCT 92 / Perkins in Pounds 116m link with Volvo


   By ANDREW BAXTER


PERKINS of the UK and Volvo Penta of Sweden, two leading manufacturers of
marine diesels, are to collaborate in developing, manufacturing and
marketing a new range of small diesels for boats.
The 10-year agreement exceeds Dollars 200m (Pounds 116m) in value, and
builds on existing collaboration over the past five years between the two
companies on light marine diesels for use as sailboat auxiliary units and
motor boats.
Under the latest deal, Volvo Penta will exclusively market a range of
jointly developed, Perkins-built marine engines of up to 0.6 litre per
cylinder and less than 150 bhp.
Mr Tony Gilroy, Perkins managing director, said: 'By combining our joint
strengths we believe that we will substantially increase our position in the
world market for diesel engines.' The deal is the second piece of good news
this week for Peterborough-based Perkins. On Monday it announced a big order
from Chrysler for high-technology 'green' engines to power a new range of
Mexican-built Dodge trucks.
