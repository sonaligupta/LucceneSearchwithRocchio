FT  22 JUL 93 / International Company News: Saab sees possible return to
profitability next year

SAAB Automobile, launching its all-important 900 model, said yesterday it
saw the possibility of a return to profit next year for the first time since
General Motors of the US bought a half-share in the company in 1989.
Mr Keith Butler-Wheelhouse, the Briton brought in by GM last year to head
Sweden's traditional rival to Volvo, declined to make a firm forecast,
warning that the gloomy outlook in world car markets, especially in Europe,
where sales have slumped 17 per cent this year, continued to cloud Saab's
prospects.
But, he added, 'I prefer to say that we have brought down the break-even
point for the company to about 80,000 units sold per year and we intend to
sell significantly more than that next year. So if nothing else changes we
should be in the black next year.'
Mr Butler-Wheelhouse acknowledged that the success of the new 900, which
will compete against the Mercedes C class, the BMW 3-series and the Audi 80,
was vital for Saab, which in the past four years has accumulated losses of
more than SKr10bn (Dollars 1.25bn) and swallowed a further SKr8bn in two
capital injections by GM and its Swedish co-owner, Saab-Scania.
He insisted that Saab was not in a 'do or die' position. He said even if
sales did not hit the high levels Saab hoped for, the company had the funds
and the support of GM and Saab-Scania to continue to develop its next new
model, an upgrade of the luxury 9000 car, due within five years.
Mr John Fleming, marketing chief, said Saab had set a sales target of 45,000
cars in the first year for the 900. The new car is a complete re-vamp of the
old 900 based on many Opel/Vauxhall components but with a distinctive body
styling and additional engineering to give it a clear Saab identity.
Saab said the new model cost SKr4.5bn and took 3 1/2 years to develop.
Savings from the link with GM were put at 30 per cent. Mr Fleming said the
car would be priced slightly below its main rivals.
The chief worry for Saab is the steep decline in its main markets. It sold
only 35,800 cars in first half of the year, compared with 86,800 in all of
1992 and 109,500 in 1989. Sales in the US - its biggest market - and Europe
were down nearly 30 per cent. In Sweden, Saab is battling against a slump
which has seen overall car sales fall from a peak of 340,000 in 1988 to an
expected 130,000 this year.
The 900 will sell hard on Saab's commitment to safety and low exhaust
emissions as well as performance. In Sweden cars will be fitted with a
'black box' to record vital data in crashes, an idea widely canvassed in the
UK.
The two-litre turbo model, one of four engine types ranging from a
two-litre, four-cylinder standard engine up to a 2.5-litre V6, will offer a
so-called 'sensonic' automatic clutch operating by touching the gear lever.
