FT  16 NOV 93 / Brussels telecoms go-ahead


   By ANDREW HILL


THE European Commission has cleared a joint venture between 12 of the
world's largest telecommunications groups, aimed at providing specialised
communication services between financial centres, writes Andrew Hill.
But the Financial Network Association had to give special undertakings that
it would not discriminate against private service suppliers. The FNA also
undertook not to use revenue from 'reserved' monopoly services to subsidise
services such as data transmission.
Companies involved are: France Telecom, Belgacom, the Belgian state telecoms
company, Italcable of Italy, Mercury Communications of the UK, Telfonica of
Spain, Deutsche Bundespost Telekom of Germany, Australia's Telstra, Hong
Kong Telecom, KDD of Japan, MCI of the US, Singapore Telecom and Stentor of
Canada.
