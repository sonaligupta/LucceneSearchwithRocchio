FT  21 APR 94 / Buthelezi banks on poll miracle


Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom party,
yesterday told supporters that it would be a miracle if his party did well
in next week's South African elections, given its late entry to the race.
The chief, pictured alongside his party's flag at the election rally, was
launching his campaign in Ulundi, capital of the KwaZulu 'homeland'.
