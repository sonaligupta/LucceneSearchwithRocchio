FT  11 MAR 92 / International Company News: Profit turnround at Paramount


   By ALAN FRIEDMAN


   NEW YORK


PARAMOUNT Communication, the publishing and entertainment group, produced a
modest first-quarter net profit of Dollars 18.4m, helped by earnings from
its Hollywood studio and from television and theatrical operations.
The profit for the three months to January 31 translates into 16 cents a
share and compares with a Dollars 7.3m loss for the same period a year ago.
In the 12 months to last October Paramount suffered a more than 50 per cent
drop in net income, to Dollars 122.2m or Dollars 1.03 a share.
Revenues for the first quarter of 1992 improved 19 per cent to Dollars
1.1bn.
At the operating level, Paramount's publishing business lost Dollars 29.7m
in the first fiscal quarter of 1992, compared with a loss of Dollars 40.8m
in the same quarter a year ago.
The publishing loss was reduced thanks to gains in textbook and
international book sales.
The entertainment division earned Dollars 73.2m in operating profit in the
first quarter, up from Dollars 28.2m a year ago. The earnings were helped by
the box office success of two Paramount films: The Addams Family and Start
Trek VI, which together took in Dollars 180m.
Earnings were also lifted by home video, pay cable television and some
television stations. Television programming earned less than a year ago. The
renovated Madison Square Garden began contributing to profits in the first
fully operational period since its relaunch.
Mr Martin Davis, Paramount chairman, said the results were encouraging. But
Mr Davis is said by many in the entertainment industry to be casting about
for a new acquisition that would offer a lift to Paramount, which is
changing the strategy of its Hollywood studio under the new leadership of Mr
Brandon Tartikoff, a former NBC executive who joined last year.
On Wall Street, Paramount's share price declined by Dollars  1/8 to Dollars
47 1/8 at close of trading.
