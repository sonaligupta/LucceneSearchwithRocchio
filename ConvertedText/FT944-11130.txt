FT  08 NOV 94 / Carey seeks stronger ties for Church and commerce


   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent


Commercial self-interest is likely to degenerate into 'gangsterism and
corruption' unless businesses are run according to sound ethical principles,
Dr George Carey, archbishop of Canterbury, said yesterday.
Dr Carey, in an address to Manchester Business School, defended wealth
creation and called for a stronger partnership between the churches and the
business community.
He emphasised, however, that he did not regard vigorous wealth creation  -
without which there was little chance of overcoming the problems of world
poverty and environmental degradation - as the same thing as the complete
free play of market forces.
He said: 'We do, indeed, need to ensure that we define our own ends as a
society and do not pretend that we can abdicate our responsibility to market
forces alone.' The market was a good servant. but a bad master, and market
forces needed to be 'constrained and directed to service the common good'.
Any attempt to remove ethics from business, was to 'remove humanity' from
the market. It was important for companies to develop a culture in which
ethical dilemmas were worked through conscientiously, he said.
Dr Carey acknowledged that clergy had pronounced too glibly about the moral
ambiguity of aspects of business.
He wanted the church to become more approachable and available for people
who were trying to wrestle with ethical challenges in a competitive world.
He hoped that the church's liturgies and worship could reflect more
adequately the 'aspirations and contribution of all those who strive to
create the wealth of our country'.
Business expertise had a vital part in play in the management of the church,
but the crude importation of business language and models would be
inappropriate and counter-productive, he said.
