FT  28 MAR 92 / Swiss franc, D-Mark link urged


   By IAN RODGER

SWITZERLAND'S central bank should declare a floor rate for its ailing franc
in relation to the Deutschmark, a leading Swiss economic research institute,
Konjunkturforschungsstelle (KOF), has suggested.
The controversial proposal brings into focus a wider debate raging in
Switzerland over whether the country can or should still conduct an
independent monetary policy, given the trend towards stabilising currency
exchange rates in Europe. By implication, the debate is also over whether
the franc can be maintained as a stable haven currency.
If the Swiss National Bank (SNB) set a target exchange rate, as KOF
suggested, the franc would in effect be pegged to the D-Mark, thereby making
it no more or less stable than the German currency. Swiss interest rates
would then rise to German levels.
The KOF proposal comes at a time when the franc is weak in foreign currency
markets in spite of intervention by the SNB. Yesterday, it traded at
SFr0.9115 to the D-Mark, compared with SFr0.89 at the beginning of the year.
KOF suggested the central bank should set a target exchange rate of SFr0.91
or SFr0.92 to the D-Mark.
In its spring forecast published yesterday, KOF said the bank was in a
difficult position because of uncertainty over Swiss participation in
European institutions and the weakness of its economy. KOF is forecasting
GDP growth of only 0.9 per cent this year, after a decline of 0.6 per cent
last year.
KOF shares the SNB's concern about imported inflation, claiming that 'a
strong devaluation of the Swiss franc would pose a very difficult problem'.
It says that in 'this special situation', the SNB 'would be well advised to
aim at stabilising exchange rate expectations'.
