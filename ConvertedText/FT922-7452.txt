FT  19 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Motorola builds semiconductor plant in
China


   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO


MOTOROLA, the US manufacturer of semiconductors and communications
equipment, is building a factory in China to make these products primarily
for the Chinese market.
The group will officially announce plans to invest Dollars 120m (Pounds
67.7m) in a factory in Tianjin, a port city outside Peking, next month, when
it will hold the ground-breaking ceremony. The factory will be built on
property which is part of the Tianjin Economic Development Authority.
In 1988, Motorola announced plans to invest about Dollars 300m in a plant in
China. The project was suspended after the Tiananmen Square clampdown on
dissident students.
Motorola expects gradually to expand the project, employing several hundred
people after the facility is completed in 1993, but increasing the number of
employees to nearly 1,000 later in the decade.
Peking has been promoting investment in high-technology industries.
Motorola's decision to go ahead with the investment follows an announcement
by NEC of Japan, in September 1990, to form two joint ventures with Chinese
companies to make digital electronic switching systems and large-scale
integrated circuits for use in a wide range of consumer products.
Philips, the Dutch group, and BTM of Belgium have already set up joint
ventures to produce large-scale integrated circuits in China.
Although the sale and export of certain products, including all but the
simplest semiconductors come under scrutiny by Cocom, the Paris-based
organisation which monitors the export of sensitive products with potential
strategic applications, Cocom rules are being gradually eased.
