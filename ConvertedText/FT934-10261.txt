FT  06 NOV 93 / London hospitals plan to retain sites


   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent


THE BOARD of the combined Guy's and St Thomas's hospitals in London
yesterday proposed a rationalisation plan involving retention of both sites.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, had asked the trust board to
consider whether clinical services could be concentrated on a single site,
following the merger of the hospitals under the government's restructur-ing
of London healthcare.
The board has concluded that 'the capital funds to achieve a single site are
unlikely to be made available or guaranteed at this time'. It is proposing a
'radically more effective provision of services', making use of the best
buildings on each site.
The trust's restructuring plans are designed to achieve a 20 per cent
reduction in unit costs. It said yesterday, it would also be necessary to
'secure manpower productivity improvements of 4 to 5 per cent in each of the
next five years.' This is certain to lead to a reduction in the hospitals'
6,700-strong workforce.
If Mrs Bottomley accepts the trust's recommendations, the two hospitals will
have only one accident and emergency department, located at St Thomas's.
Guy's accident department would close, although a minor injuries service
might be established there. Other departments would be reorganised between
the two sites to provide the best clinical coherence.
In deciding to retain both hospitals, board members are certain to have
taken account of their relatively low site values. Recent valuations are
believed to have put price tags of Pounds 19m on Guy's and Pounds 23m on St
Thomas's.
The trust says its rationalisation proposals would enable Guy's and St
Thomas's to sustain 90 per cent of the present volume of services.
Reorganisation of departments to provide a fully integrated service would be
achieved over five years.
