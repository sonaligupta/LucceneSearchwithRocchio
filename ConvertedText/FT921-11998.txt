FT  29 JAN 92 / International Company News: USX results plunge into the red
in fourth quarter


   By MARTIN DICKSON


   NEW YORK


USX, the US steel and energy group, yesterday reported a fourth-quarter loss
of Dollars 394m, compared with a profit of Dollars 267m last year, as both
its US Steel business and the Marathon oil subsidiary plunged into the red.
US Steel, which has been hit hard by the US recession, reported a net loss
of Dollars 165m on sales of Dollars 1.3bn, against income of Dollars 51m on
sales of Dollars 1.6bn in the same period of 1990.
USX is unusual in that it lists the shares of its steel and energy
components separately and attributes earnings to the two separate parts of
the business.
Fourth-quarter losses per share at the steel group totalled Dollars 3.25,
compared with a profit of 99 cents a year ago. The figures included
restructuring charges of Dollars 80m and litigation and environmental
charges of Dollars 49m. Litigation and environmental charges totalled
Dollars 61m a year ago.
For the full year, the steel group lost Dollars 507m, against net income of
Dollars 310m in 1990.
Mr Charles Corry, USX chairman, said both prices and domestic demand had
been down substantially from 1990. While some economists remained hopeful
for 1992, the near-term outlook for the US Steel group was clouded by
continuing weakness in the domestic economy and over-supply in world steel
markets.
The expiration, at the end of the first quarter, of the voluntary restraint
agreements governing imports to the US added to the uncertain-ty.
The Marathon business produced a fourth-quarter net loss of Dollars 229m, or
90 cents a share, compared with net income of Dollars 216m, or 84 cents, in
the fourth quarter of last year. Sales were Dollars 3.6bn, down from Dollars
4.6bn.
The net loss included an unfavourable non-cash inventory market valuation
reserve adjustment of Dollars 260m, while the same period last year included
a favourable Dollars 140m adjustment. For the year, Marathon lost Dollars
71m, against income in 1990 of Dollars 508m.
Mr Corry said the decline in operating income stemmed primarily from lower
liquid hydrocarbon prices and reduced refined product margins.
