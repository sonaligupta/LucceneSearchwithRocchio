FT  22 OCT 92 / International Company News: Syntex in move to cut costs


   By PAUL ABRAHAMS


SYNTEX, the US pharma-ceuticals group, said yesterday it was implementing a
cost-cutting programme that would involve restructuring some of its
administrative and marketing organisations and eliminate a number of
positions.
The cuts, almost unprecedented in the drugs industry, follow the statement
by Eli Lilly, another US group, that it was taking a charge of Dollars 519m
to close manufacturing facilities.
Syntex said it would reshuffle some of its research and development
activities to focus on the most promising programmes. The company said the
move followed disappointing results during the first two months of its
fiscal 1993 first quarter.
