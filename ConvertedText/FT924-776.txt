FT  22 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Culver offer for DG Durham


   By ANGUS FOSTER


CULVER Holdings, which was formed to make a recommended offer for Wyndham
Group in July last year, is to buy the operating subsidiaries of DG Durham,
the insurance group whose shares were suspended on the USM in October.
Culver will also make an offer of one new Culver share for every five Durham
shares. The offer, equivalent to 0.8p per Durham share, values the whole
company at Pounds 160,000.
However, because Culver does not want to be liable for Durham's borrowings
of Pounds 1.4m or certain outstanding legal claims against the company,
Culver will sell on any shares acquired under the offer to Masterglobal,
which already owns 51 per cent in Durham.
Mr John Biles, the largest shareholder in Culver with 27 per cent, also
controls Durham through a 74 per cent stake in Masterglobal. Two other
Culver directors are directors of Durham.
The acquisition and offer need approval from independent shareholders from
both companies. Durham's independent directors and financial adviser Guiness
Mahon will recommend the offer. Culver's offer is being made by Credit
Lyonnais Laing.
Culver will pay up to Pounds 262,000 for Durham's operating subsidiaries,
which include Accident & General, a travel insurance broker. Culver, which
owns Honda and BMW franchises, intends to inject the subsidiaries into a new
insurance division.
Before the proposals were announced, Durham had been unable to file accounts
because its bankers, Barclays, refused to confirm the availability of
continued facilities. The accounts were filed yesterday, showing a pre-tax
loss of Pounds 4.29m in the 15 months to March 31.
Durham's shares are due to resume trading on the USM today. They closed at
4p before suspension.
