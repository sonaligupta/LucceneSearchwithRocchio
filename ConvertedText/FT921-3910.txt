FT  12 MAR 92 / Observer: Gagged


Meanwhile, don't expect any help from UK government departments on even the
smallest detail of policy for the next few weeks. Observer twice contacted
the Lord Chancellor's office yesterday for information on planned changes in
the small claims court procedures announced in the Budget.
Help was readily given in the morning. But after lunch, and John Major's
election announcement, the office declared it could henceforth make no
comment on government policy.
The Inland Revenue, perhaps understandably, was still faster to start
pushing the chancellor of the exchequer's proposals back into the purdah
whence they came. Warnings of the likely cancellation of its post-Budget
briefing, scheduled for this morning, were emanating from it on Tuesday even
before Lamont spoke.
