FT  26 JUN 92 / Money-back offer from Lloyds Bank


A LETTER from the bank manager next month will bring good news for several
thousand Lloyds Bank customers.
The bank has discovered that it overcharged some current-account customers
for overdrafts for up to five years, and 35,000 of its staff are combing
records to identify them and arrange refunds.
Lloyds said: 'The process will be completed by July 3 and in the week after
that each branch manager will send out a mildly embarrassed letter to those
customers affected.'
