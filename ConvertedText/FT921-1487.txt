FT  24 MAR 92 / International Company News: Hong Kong Land rises 11%

HONG KONG Land, the Jardine Matheson group's property investment arm,
announced profit after tax for 1991 of USDollars 298.1m, an increase of 11
per cent from USDollars 267.7m in 1990.
The company, which dominates the office and retail market in the colony's
financial district, reported an extraordinary profit of USDollars 115.8m
from the sale of seven non-core Hong Kong properties. It said none of its
other properties was on the market, refuting widespread speculation that
core properties may soon be sold.
Hong Kong Land recorded an average occupancy rate of 97 per cent on its
investment portfolio. The average rental rates on office and retail space
increased by 16 per cent and 31 per cent respectively, despite the softening
rental market in 1992. Much of this would be attributable to the disposal of
non-core properties, commanding significantly lower rentals.
Mr Simon Keswick, chairman, said there was little scope for earnings growth
in 1992 from the existing Hong Kong portfolio. However, he said: 'The group
is in a strong financial position to take advantage of opportunities either
in Hong Kong or in depressed world property markets.'
The company had net borrowing of USDollars 349.9m at the year-end,
representing only 8 per cent of shareholders' funds.
Hong Kong Land's investment portfolio has come under pressure from an
increase in supply of top-grade office space on Hong Kong island, which
resulted in a sharp overall decline in market rental rates last year.
The directors recommended a final dividend of 6.15 US cents per share,
making a total of 9 cents for the year, compared with 8.25 cents in 1990.
The company also announced plans to transfer its primary listing to London
if the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong goes ahead with proposed changes in its
secondary listing rules.
