FT  04 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Knuckles rapped over salmon
price fixing


   By ANDREW HILL


   BRUSSELS


SCOTTISH AND Norwegian salmon farmers have been reprimanded by the European
Commission for trying to fix minimum prices for their fish.
The commission has not imposed any fines on the three Scottish salmon
farming associations involved because the price-fixing agreement was
abandoned last October. The Norwegian Fish Farmers' Sales Organisation (FOS)
went bankrupt a month later, ending its own minimum price system.
Officials in Brussels described the move as 'knuckle-rapping after the
event', and said they had issued a statement to make it clear that private
anti-competitive agreements were unacceptable even when a market was under
pressure from alleged 'dumping' by third country producers.
Brussels' statement probably marks the final episode in the most recent saga
of strained relations between EC and Norwegian salmon farmers.
Scottish salmon farmers started to co-operate on fixing minimum prices in
December 1989. At the time, the Scottish industry was in crisis and blamed
Norwegian competitors for over-producing salmon and breaching their own
system of minimum pricing.
Community producers complained to the EC about the alleged dumping of
Norwegian salmon. The commission found that there was dumping but did not
impose protective duties because the Norwegians agreed to stick to their own
system of minimum prices in future and to freeze any excess production.
After talking to the Norwegians the Scottish Salmon Farmers' Marketing
Board, the Scottish Salmon Growers' Association and the Shetland Salmon
Farmers' Association - which account for about 80 per cent of Scottish
salmon production - urged their members to bring prices into line with the
FOS system. As a result, salmon prices, which had dropped by nearly 25 per
cent in Scotland since 1988, leapt by 27 per cent in January 1990.
