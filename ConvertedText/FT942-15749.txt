FT  14 APR 94 / Solid growth shown in US


   By MICHAEL PROWSE


   WASHINGTON


The US economy saw solid growth and only modest upward pressure on inflation
in the first quarter, in spite of distortions caused by bad weather,
official figures indicated yesterday.
The Commerce Department said retail sales rose 0.4 per cent last month in
cash terms, and by 8.9 per cent in the year to March.
The monthly gain was less than expected in financial markets, prompting an
initial rally in bond prices. However, bond prices subsequently drifted
lower again because data for sales in previous months was revised up,
suggesting greater strength of consumption at the start of the year than
previously suspected.
Retail sales, excluding cars, were revised up by a total of 0.6 per cent in
January and February.
Allowing for the revisions, the figures indicate real consumer spending may
have grown at an annual rate of 4 per cent or more in the first quarter.
Some analysts believe the economy will benefit from 'catch-up' spending this
month - a rebound in sales of building materials last month did not fully
compensate for weather-related declines in January and February.
The consumer price index rose by 0.3 per cent last month and 2.5 per cent in
the year to March, roughly in line with market expectations. The 'core'
index, which excludes the volatile components of food and energy, rose by
0.3 per cent and 2.9 per cent respectively.
Bond yields have risen steeply in recent weeks on fears that faster growth
will lead to higher inflation. However, few analysts are surprised by the
relatively subdued consumer price index. Nascent inflationary pressures
usually show in commodity and wholesale price indices before being passed on
to the consumer.
