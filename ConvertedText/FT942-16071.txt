FT  12 APR 94 / International Company News: Hugo Boss advances to record


   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN


   STUTTGART


Hugo Boss, the biggest German menswear designer, yesterday unveiled record
profits, up 73 per cent to DM76.5m (Dollars 44.7m) for 1993.
Worldwide sales, though, were 7.8 per cent lower.
Mr Peter Littmann, chief executive, said the company would take advantage of
a tax break and good liquidity to pay a one-off dividend of DM117.50 per
share.
He added that a 'difficult environment' meant sales this year were likely to
match levels achieved last year.
Disregarding the extraordinary items, profits would have been DM48.6m, up 10
per cent.
'The 1993 profits are not repeatable,' Mr Littmann said. 'Not now or in the
next 10 years.'
On top of the extraordinary dividend, ordinary shares will receive a DM23
dividend, up from DM21, while holders of preferential stock will receive
DM24.50, also up DM2.
Mr Littmann blamed the drop in sales on weak markets in Europe and the
restructuring of the US division.
However, Boss labels were a huge success in new Asian markets, where
turnover in some cases doubled.
The company is 50.4 per cent owned by the Italian Marzotto group while the
Holy brothers, grandsons of the founder, still hold a 7 per cent stake.
Turnover was down 10 per cent on the year before but Mr Littmann said that
would not influence year-end results.
