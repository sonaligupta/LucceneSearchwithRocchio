FT  16 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Small is not best council structure


   From Ms JANET JONES


Sir, Margaret Singh's claim (Letters, November 5) that the Association of
District Councils does not wish to squabble with counties will cause a
hollow laugh in county councils which have watched the Association of
District Councils and its member authorities do little else for the last six
years in their sordid campaign to abolish county councils. So will her claim
that the districts' prime concern is with the provision of quality services.
I remind Margaret Singh that Labour party support for unitary authorities is
linked to the establishment of regional government. The two go together.
Since the last thing Mr David Curry, the local government minister, will
give us is regional government, the last thing we need is the small unitary
councils advocated by the ADC. What is needed is a local government
structure capable of the strategic planning and effective delivery of key
services. That is what county councils do well.
Whatever political parties may propose, there is no evidence that the
British public has any enthusiasm for changing local government structures
or for paying the inevitably large bills this entails. Quite the opposite.
People are more concerned to have good and responsive services provided at
the lowest possible cost. If the ADC is serious about promoting better
services it should set aside its obsessions with reorganisation and
encourage its member authorities to get on with the job for which they have
been established and democratically elected - and in which they will
continue to find county councils willing partners.
