FT  02 JUL 92 / International Company News: Reorganisation at O&K will cost
more jobs


   By ANDREW BAXTER


ORENSTEIN & Koppel (O&K), the big German construction equipment and
escalator producer, is to reduce its workforce by 780, or 9.5 per cent, and
streamline its management as part of a reorganisation plan unveiled in
Dortmund yesterday.
The shake-up will reduce O&K's workforce to 7,400, and comes on top of about
1,000 job cuts last year. It follows the approval by shareholders in Hoesch,
the German steel group which owns 75 per cent of O&K, of the long-awaited
takeover by Fried. Krupp.
The reorganisation, as disclosed in the Financial Times earlier this week,
includes the sale of O&K's plant and systems division to Hoesch. The
division will be combined with its counterpart at Krupp Industrietechnik.
O&K said yesterday that the reorganisation and new corporate strategy was
aimed at ensuring 'the long-term and permanent strengthening and
stabilisation of the company.'
The company admitted that its expansion during the 1980s had led to
'dissipation and heavy burdens on the capital structure and personnel
resources.'
Coupled with the sharp fall in the US dollar and the big recent decline in
the western European construction equipment market, this has forced O&K to
concentrate on its traditional strengths.
A new slimmed-down management structure will remove two levels of
management. In addition, Mr Dieter Schneider and Mr Wolfgang Starke will
join the 0&K management board from Hoesch.
O&K had total sales last year of DM2.38bn, from DM2.41bn in 1990, and will
report a loss for 1991 because of heavy restructuring costs and provisions.
Sales of the new-look O&K are expected to reach DM1.8bn to DM1.9bn this
year.
