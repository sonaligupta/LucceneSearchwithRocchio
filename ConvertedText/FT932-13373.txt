FT  23 APR 93 / UK Company News: Spring Ram attracts critics


   By JANE FULLER


SPRING RAM, the kitchens and bathrooms group, finally brought out its annual
report and accounts yesterday, with several more items under the 'notes to
the accounts' heading.
The document was read with particular interest by analysts, because the
group blamed its sharp fall in 1992 profits - the first setback since its
flotation in 1983 - on a change in accounting policies and pressure for a
conservative approach.
The report includes a proposal that Arthur Andersen be reappointed as
auditors on May 21.
The board had engaged in much haggling with the accountancy firm prior to
bringing out a pre-tax profit figure of Pounds 26.2m, a third less than
expected.
The extra work earned Andersen higher auditing fees of Pounds 170,000
(Pounds 140,000) and an additional Pounds 391,000 (Pounds 136,000) on
non-audit fees.
A few of the new notes, however, were criticised by analysts for not showing
100 per cent conservatism: for instance, the carrying forward of some
marketing and business development costs and the capitalising of interest on
some investment in fixed assets.
There was also quibbling over the group's claim to having year-end net cash
of Pounds 10m, because the figure excluded Pounds 4.74m owed in non-bank
loans and Pounds 6.52m in bills of exchange.
Mr Stuart Greenwood, the finance director who has resigned over accounting
controversies at the group but is carrying on until a replacement is found,
said these items were partly to do with tax and partly trade credit.
On the accounting policy questions, he commented: 'Some would say not
everything is conservative, but I think the accounts are substantially
prudent.'
