FT  02 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei rises above
16,000 on short-covering

   TOKYO


A FALL in short-term interest rates prompted investors to cover short
positions, and the Nikkei average rallied above the 16,000 level for the
first time in four days, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei put on 373.34, or 2.3 per cent, to 16,325.07. Weak futures
dragged the 225-issue average down in the morning to the day's low of
15,731.83. Small-lot index buying and bargain hunting lifted the index in
the late afternoon to the session's high of 16,326.07.
Volume remained low, at 200m shares, down from 219m. Rises outnumbered
declines by 668 to 259, with 165 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all
first section stocks gained 22.78 to 1,258.98, but in London trading the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index slipped 4.40 to 993.26.
Futures traders, encouraged by the fall in the overnight call money rate,
covered short positions, prompting index-linked buying in the cash market.
Small-lot bargain hunting by investment trusts and foreign investors was
also seen. However, traders said there was little real buying interest.
High-technology issues were purchased by bargain hunters. Toshiba, the day's
most active stock, appreciated Y13 to Y660 and NEC rose Y49 to Y873.
Construction shares, which plunged on Tuesday on worries about large loan
guarantees, recovered on short-covering. Nishimatsu Construction rose Y64 to
Y979 and Sato Kogyo Y73 to Y783.
Isetan, having fallen some 20 per cent in the previous three days on rumours
of financial problems at its leading shareholder, rebounded Y250 to Y1,850
on individual buying.
House Food Industrial dropped Y260 to Y2,040 on reports of problems at its
financial subsidiary. The leading food group said it planned to transfer its
stockholding in the financial affiliate to another company in the group,
thus removing it from its consolidated balance sheet.
In Osaka, the OSE average improved 124.72 to 18,813.74 in volume of 11.8m
shares.
Roundup
TOKYO HAD a limited effect on the region. Taiwan and Bangkok were closed for
bank holidays, the latter to reopen with extended working hours today.
Trading at Bombay remained suspended.
HONG KONG finished at another record high, boosted by expectations of an
easing in credit. The Hang Seng index climbed 30.83 to 6,134.75 and turnover
leapt to HKDollars 4.43bn from HKDollars 3.46bn.
In spite of Monday's sharp downward correction, most brokers said the
underlying tone remained solid, regarding the tumble as the product of
futures settlement, and profit-taking following last week's strong rise.
AUSTRALIA's All Ordinaries index firmed 3.0 to 1,647.7 as disappointing
economic statistics for May rekindled hopes for an interest rate cut.
NEW ZEALAND closed steady, investors holding back ahead of tonight's
government budget, even though no surprises are expected. There was strong
buying in some second-line stocks as institutions started a fresh financial
period.
The NZSE-40 index edged up 1.41 to 1,522.06. Turnover was NZDollars 22.4m,
including some Dollars 7m for Robt Jones Investment shares. The property
company announced a NZDollars 132.9m annual loss after the close on Tuesday,
but the shares held yesterday at 21 cents.
MANILA retreated on profit-taking. The composite index shed 31.72 to
1,524.09 and turnover fell to 237.27m pesos from 521.18m. The market was
shut on Tuesday for the inauguration of President Fidel Ramos.
Only mining issues posted gains, pushed up by a nine-month high for copper
prices.
SEOUL was kept in a tight range by falling customer deposits. The composite
index eased 0.05 to 551.98 in turnover of Won189.6bn (Won172.7bn).
KARACHI fell on political unrest in the troubled Sind province, the KSE
index closing 24.11 lower at 1,520.90 after a local holiday on Tuesday.
