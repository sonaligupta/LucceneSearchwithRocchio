FT  13 NOV 92 / German defence minister delivers stern warning to soldiers


   By JUDY DEMPSEY


   BONN


ANY GERMAN soldiers involved in attacks against foreigners or spreading
racist propaganda will be immediately prosecuted or disciplined, Mr Volker
Ruhe, defence minister, warned yesterday, Judy Dempsey writes from Bonn.
His statement followed an internal report that 24 conscripts had taken part
in attacks against foreign citizens living in Germany. Three of the soldiers
are being tried for manslaughter.
Last month, General Helge Hansen, an army commander, wrote to fellow senior
officers instructing them to be more vigilant in snuffing out right-wing
extremism in the ranks.
