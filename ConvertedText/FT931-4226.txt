FT  11 MAR 93 / International Company News: MasterCard files suit against
Amexco


   By ALAN FRIEDMAN


   NEW YORK


MASTERCARD, the US credit card company, has filed a lawsuit in a New York
federal court accusing American Express of using 'false and misleading'
advertising to promote its American Express corporate credit card.
The MasterCard legal action, which seeks to block three American Express
advertisements, also seeks financial damages.
MasterCard alleged in its court action that American Express was not telling
the truth in one advertisement in which it claimed its corporate card was
superior to other cards because there were no late fees or other charges.
American Express, according to the suit, does assess penalties for overdue
payments.
Ms Christine Levite, of American Express, claimed there was no merit to the
lawsuit.
Mr Parker Bagley, a lawyer for MasterCard, said the suit was filed after
American Express declined a request to withdraw the offending
advertisements.
General Motors, which has issued more than 5m MasterCard-based GM credit
cards since launching the non-bank card last September, said it was
launching a Visa-based GM card in the Canadian market.
The card will be issued under an agreement between General Motors of Canada
and Toronto Dominion Bank.
