FT  03 AUG 92 / Arab MPs in Israeli government


   By HUGH CARNEGY and REUTER


   JERUSALEM


TWO ARAB members of the Israeli parliament were yesterday appointed deputy
ministers in prime minister Yitzhak Rabin's Labour-led coalition, the first
time in two decades that an Arab has been included in the government.
The cabinet also decided to accept an invitation from the US and Russia,
co-sponsors of the Middle East peace negotiations, to resume bilateral talks
with Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and the Palestinians in Washington on August 24.
The talks are scheduled to last a month in an attempt to achieve a
breakthrough. They will be the first talks since Mr Rabin took power last
month promising to accelerate the peace process which made little progress
under his predecessor, Mr Yitzhak Shamir.
Further underlining the contrast with Mr Shamir's hardline government, the
cabinet voted to appoint Mr Nawaf Masalha, a Labour MP, deputy minister for
health. Mr Walid Sadek, of Labour's left-liberal coalition partner Meretz,
is to be deputy interior minister.
Reuter adds: Israeli settlers in occupied Arab lands vowed yesterday to
continue building new homes in the West Bank and Gaza Strip despite a
government decision to freeze new construction. Members of the group said on
Israeli television they would raise funds privately.
It was not clear whether such private building was legal. An adviser to the
minister of housing said the legal aspects of the proposal would be checked.
