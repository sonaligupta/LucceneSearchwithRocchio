FT  16 JAN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar resumes strong rally


   By SIMON LONDON


THE DOLLAR continued on its upward path on the foreign exchange markets
yesterday, rising a full four pfennigs against the D-Mark in hectic morning
trading in London and holding on to the best of the gains through the
afternoon session, writes Simon London.
Overnight trading in the Far East was subdued, with Tokyo closed for a
national holiday. The dollar opened the day in Europe little changed from
its closing levels in New York on Tuesday night at around DM1.5930 and
Y126.75.
However, any hopes that the US currency would simply consolidate the gains
made on Tuesday were soon dispelled. The dollar climbed to a peak of
DM1.6280 and Y128.65 by mid-morning as dealers rushed to close short
positions and take advantage of the bull run.
The US unit surged to pass both the DM1.60 and DM1.62 barriers, as automatic
stop-loss trading programmes kicked into action. By the London close the
dollar stood at DM1.6220, from DM1.5905 on Tuesday, and Y128.40, from
Y126.80. In New York it finished mildly higher at DM1.6235 and Y128.55.
As on Tuesday, the best of the gains were at the expense of the D-Mark.
Analysts pointed to continued uncertainty over the current round of wage
negotiations in Germany as a reason for this weakness.
In addition, a speech given by Mr Wilhelm Noelling, a Bundesbank board
member, the text of which was released in advance, suggested that German
interest rates would be reduced if wage claims were not too high and if the
global economy continued to slow.
The D-Mark weakened within the European exchange rate mechanism. Sterling
gained ground to stand comfortably above DM2.85 by mid-morning.
However, this was still only just above its effective floor in the ERM,
which rose as the Spanish peseta also appreciated against the German
currency. The peseta improved to Pta63.41 against the D-Mark, from Pta63.57
on Tuesday. But in the afternoon session the Spanish currency drifted back
to close at Pta63.4950. One reason was the release of unexpectedly weak
inflation data for December, suggesting that the Bank of Spain may be able
to cut interest rates earlier than previously supposed.
The consumer price index rose just 0.1 per cent on the month, the same rate
as during November, against expectations of a 0.4 per cent increase. This
left inflation for the full year running at 5.5 per cent, from 6.5 per cent
in 1990. Many analysts had been expecting a year-on-year rate of growth of
around 5.8 per cent.
As the peseta fell back, so did sterling's floor, and the UK currency ended
the day at DM2.8475, from DM2.85 on Tuesday.
The strength of the US dollar also hit the Canadian currency, subject of
intervention only last week to cap its rise. The Canadian dollar traded down
to CDollars 1.1570, from CDollars 1.1470.
