FT  26 JUN 92 / Lords decision adds to Sunday trade confusion


   By BETHAN HUTTON and JOHN THORNHILL


YESTERDAY'S House of Lords ruling left both retailers and councils even more
confused than before about their legal position on Sunday trading, with both
sides calling on the government to fulfil its pledges to legislate.
Supermarkets in most areas of England and Wales probably have at least one
more weekend to make the most of Sunday profits before being served with
injunctions, as most local authorities are studying the ruling before making
any decisions.
Retailers were left little the wiser about whether it was now 'legal' for
them to open stores on Sundays. Asda, the Leeds-based grocery chain, summed
up the uncertainty: 'At this stage we have not decided not to open our
stores.'
Stoke-on-Trent and Norwich city councils, whose case against B&Q, the DIY
chain, is under consideration by the European Court, welcomed the Lords'
judgment.
Mr Paul Hodgson, Stoke's assistant town clerk, said: 'This is a major
breakthrough for councils which have been trying to uphold the law.'
Traders in Stoke are in the most immediate danger of injunctions. The
council said: 'Now that the fear of damages has gone, it has opened the way
to us to continue our policy of closing shops on Sunday and taking out
injunctions. Whether it will start this weekend it is a little too early to
say, but it will certainly start as soon as possible.'
Stores in Norwich may have more breathing space. Mr Richard Auton, Norwich's
director of law and administration, said it was likely that the council
would resume its policy of taking out injunctions, but not immediately.
The council may wait to hear the preliminary opinion of the European
advocate general on the B&Q case, which is expected within a month.
Most retailers seemed likely to continue opening stores unless injunctions
specifically prevented them from doing so.
Mr Kevin Hawkins, corporate affairs director of WH Smith, which jointly owns
the Do-It-All DIY chain with Boots, said: 'In practical terms the difference
it will make or not make depends entirely on how a small minority of local
authorities react.'
As far as he was aware, the company would open all its stores this Sunday.
B&Q said its stores would open unless injunctions were sought and obtained.
Mr Nigel Whittaker, corporate affairs director of Kingfisher, the retailing
group which owns B&Q, said: 'The effect of this judgment is that it is open
sesame for local-authority action. But it must also be a massive incentive
for the government to sort the problem out as quickly as possible.'
Local authorities and retailers were united in the view that the ball was
firmly back in the government's court.
The British Retail Consortium, which represents 90 per cent of the retail
trade, said: 'This judgment does not take us any further forward. Retailers
are still looking to the government finally to agree what the law is in this
country as far as Sunday trading is concerned.'
Mr Andrew Scott, adviser to the Labour-dominated Association of London
Authorities on trading standards, hopes the ruling will 'act as a spur to
the government to bring forward proposals for reform'.
The Conservatives included a commitment to introduce legislation on Sunday
trading in its general election manifesto. In the Commons on June 18 Mr
Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, reaffirmed government intention to take
action on the issue. 'The House must address the issue, and reach some clear
solution,' he said. 'What we need is an accepted law on Sunday trading,
within which all retailers can compete on level terms.'
He stopped short of condemning retailers that opened their shops. 'No one is
breaking the law because the House of Lords has decided it is not clear what
the law is,' he said.
The government's position will probably be crystallised by the European
Court decision, due this autumn, and by Mr Ray Powell's private member's
bill, which is trying to change the law along the lines of proposals from
the Keep Sunday Special Campaign.

LEGAL MILESTONES ON ROUTE TO THE JUDGMENT
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   April 1986: Shops Bill falls on second reading in Commons after
               Conservative backbench rebellion. Bill based on 1984 Auld
               Committee report which recommended all restrictions on
               Sunday trading be removed.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
         1987: Conservative party's election manifesto promises reform.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
         1988: Eleven courts involved in Sunday trading cases refer to
               European Court of Justice the question of whether Shops
               Act is incompatible with free movement of goods
               provisions of the Rome Treaty. The lead case is Torfaen v
               B&Q.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
November 1989: European Court rules that Shops Act potentially
               incompatible with EC law. English and Welsh courts
               effectively told to see whether there is any other way of
               attaining objectives of Shops Act without general Sunday
               closure.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
         1990: Several crown court trials result in store acquittals.
               Courts confused over meaning of European decision. Local
               authorities turn to legal injunctions.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    July 1990: High Court rules in case involving Stoke City Council
               and B&Q that Shops Act not incompatible with EC law.
               Stoke given final injunction. B&Q appeals direct to Law
               Lords.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   April 1991: Court of Appeal rules in cases involving Kirklees and
               Wickes and Mendip and B&Q that councils must give
               cross-undertakings to compensate for any losses suffered
               from enforced closure if stores eventually win their case
               in Europe. More than 100 injunctions set aside as
               councils cannot afford financial risk.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
     May 1991: Law Lords adjourn appeal by B&Q and refer a series of
               questions to the European Court. Law Lords want to know
               whether European Court's 1989 ruling in Torfaen case has
               been affected by its 1991 rulings in a Belgian case
               involving Marchandise and French case involving Conforma.
               In those cases the court ruled that national laws
               imposing restrictions on Sunday working were not
               incompatible with EC free movement of goods rules.
               Advocate general's preliminary opinion due on July 8 and
               judgment expected September/October.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
         1992: Conservatives reaffirm their intention to legislate.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
     May 1992: Mr Ray Powell, Usdaw-sponsored Labour MP, plans private
               member's bill to restrict further Sunday opening.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 June 25 1992: Law Lords rule in favour of Kirklees in a case against
               Wickes, the DIY chain.
