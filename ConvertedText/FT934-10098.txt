FT  06 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Unilever


THE BENEFITS of Unilever's exposure to emerging markets are expected to show
when the Anglo-Dutch food and consumer products group reports its third
quarter results on Friday. Forecasts of pre-tax profits range from Pounds
608m to Pounds 635m, up from Pounds 584m last time.
Growth is expected to have come almost entirely from regions such as Asia,
with a continued flat performance in the US and Europe. The figures are also
likely to be boosted by recent acquisitions, the consolidation of
subsidiaries and the impact of currency movements on the sterling results.
