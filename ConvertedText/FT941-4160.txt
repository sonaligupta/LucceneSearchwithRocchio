FT  12 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Statutory employer funding of Tecs
needed


   From Mr PETER ASHBY


Sir, Your excellent leader comment on 'How Europe Can Compete' (March 9)
captures the essential differences between the 'Anglo-Saxon' liberal
approach towards labour market reform, and the more corporatist 'Rhine
model'. Those of us who favour the liberal approach, for its ability to
stimulate more jobs more quickly, must find ways of tackling one of its main
defects: less overall investment in skills.
It is now time for those who support Training and Enterprise Councils, and
the great steps forward that have been achieved, to recognise that Tecs have
not been radical enough. They have not brought on the new funding streams
necessary to underpin a big increase in skill levels.
The best way ahead would seem to lie through local systems of automatic
employer membership of Tecs, with all employers required to pay a
subscription to their Tec - apart from those who achieve the Investors In
People kitemark, who should be exempt.
Interestingly, this idea does not seem to provoke instant hostility among
employers in the way that national levies have done, over the years. After
all, if employers are meant to feel that they 'own' their local Tec, as
symbolised by the fact that two-thirds of the seats on boards are reserved
for the private sector, it is hardly unreasonable to expect them to pay
something towards the cost of ownership.
Statutory employer funding of Tecs could do much to help redress the UK's
chronic under-investment in skills. Coupled with strategies for encouraging
individuals to invest more in their own learning, it should now command a
wide measure of support - across the political spectrum.
