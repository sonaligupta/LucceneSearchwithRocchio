FT  28 JAN 94 / Labour calls for probe into Astra


   By DAVID OWEN


Labour yesterday called for a public inquiry into the collapse of Astra
Training, accusing the government of squandering a precious national asset.
Mr Tony Lloyd, shadow employment minister, said the training provider, set
up when the government privatised the Skills Training Agency, had
'systematically milked' the training funding system.
'Clearly ordinary audit procedures - and three successive secretaries of
state for employment - failed to protect public money,' he said.
The Department of Employment said there was no need for an inquiry.
Setting out his concerns in a letter to Mr David Hunt, the employment
secretary, Mr Lloyd said the government could not dismiss its
responsibilities by claiming that Astra was a private company.
'It was a public asset, paid for and built up with public money,' he said.
'It was sold off at a loss by the government and it has been milking the
public purse.'
Astra, which went into receivership last July, was paid Pounds 11m to take
over most of the government's skill centres.
