FT  01 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Commons endorses scrutiny bodies


   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent


MPs LAST night approved a motion authorising the establishment of select
committees to scrutinise the work of most government departments.
Demands from both sides of the House for the appointment of a select
committee on Northern Ireland were rejected by a government majority of 173
(201-28).
Mr Tony Newton, leader of the House, was jeered when he insisted that it
would be wrong to take such a step while the constitutional talks on the
future government of the province were still in progress.
There was also support from both sides of the House for a Labour move to
ensure that absorption of the Department of Energy by the Department of
Trade and Industry did not result in energy issues being denied adequate
consideration.
An attempt to appoint a sub-committee to deal with energy was defeated by a
government majority of 112 (179-67).
Mr Bruce Grocott, a Labour frontbench spokesman, urged the select committee
scrutinising the new Department for the National Heritage to investigate the
steady decline in public-service broadcasting.
He claimed that a 'Thatcherite view of broadcasting' was being imposed on
the industry, where morale was at an all-time low.
