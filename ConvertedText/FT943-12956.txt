FT  22 JUL 94 / N Korea talks date agreed


US and North Korean officials, meeting in New York, agreed yesterday on a
date for the two countries to resume negotiations on their nuclear dispute,
agencies report. The date, during the first week of August, is expected to
be announced today after it has been confirmed by top officials in
Washington and Pyongyang.
The negotiations, which began in Geneva on July 8, were broken off after
only one day because of the death of North Korean leader Kim Il-sung.
The US is offering diplomatic and economic concessions if North Korea
abandons any plans to build nuclear weapons.
