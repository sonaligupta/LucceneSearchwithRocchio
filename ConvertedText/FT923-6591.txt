FT  24 AUG 92 / World News In Brief: European Monetary System


Sterling and the Portuguese escudo dominated the European Exchange Rate
Mechanism's grid last week. The pound virtually hit its floor against the
D-Mark, putting the Bank of England under heavy pressure to intervene. The
pound has diverged by 76 percentage points from its central ecu rate and
some dealers say that this puts the Bank under a moral obligation to
intervene. The Portuguese escudo slid five places in the grid after the Bank
of Portugal cut its intervention rate by 1 per cent, triggering a run on the
currency.
