FT  25 MAR 92 / International Company News: AT&T and American Express in
card link


   By MARTIN DICKSON


   NEW YORK


AMERICAN Express and American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&T), two corporate
giants under pressure from nimble rivals, have joined forces in an attempt
to woo the US small business community.
They have announced that AT&T's corporate calling card and the American
Express corporate charge card would be jointly marketed to small businesses
as a single entity.
The system will allow small businesses that are American Express corporate
card members to charge AT&T telecommunications expenses along with other
out-of-office expenses and get a single monthly statement.
American Express is under pressure from the Visa and Mastercard credit card
operations. American Express still dominates this sector, but over the past
year some key US corporate customers have switched to its rivals.
AT&T, which has also had great success with a Visa card aimed at the
consumer market, faces intense competition in the long-distance business
communications market from rivals such as MCI and Sprint.
