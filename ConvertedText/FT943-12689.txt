FT  23 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Lower exceptionals cut deficit at Ascot


Lower exceptional costs and reduced finance charges enabled Ascot Holdings,
the property, pubs and hotels group formerly known as Control Securities, to
cut pre-tax losses from Pounds 79.6m, restated for FRS 3, to Pounds 6.88m in
the year to March 31.
Operating profits were Pounds 10.4m (Pounds 8.64m) including Pounds 2.43m
(Pounds 2.49m) from discontinued activities, giving a 29 per cent increase
on continuing operations. Net exceptional profits added Pounds 1.03m against
costs of Pounds 58.1m, which took into account a Pounds 53.4m deficit on the
revaluation of fixed assets. Net finance charges were Pounds 18m (Pounds
30m).
Mr Howard Dyer, chairman, said trading in the first two months of the
present year was on plan.
He added, however, that the company remained highly geared with negative net
assets although borrowings were cut over the year from Pounds 233.5m to
Pounds 141.4m. In addition, bondholders interest becomes payable from 1996
and the bank facilities remain on demand.
As a result the company is working on a financial restructuring. This
follows a restructure involving bondholders in June last year.
During the year there were 80 asset disposals as well as the sale of
Belhaven Brewery and Heywood Business Park.
Turnover was Pounds 77.9m (Pounds 80.1m) with Pounds 19.3m (Pounds 24m) from
discontinued activities. Continuing operations showed an increase of 4.4 per
cent.
Losses per share were 2.1p (21.8p).
