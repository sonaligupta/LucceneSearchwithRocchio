FT  16 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Brussels set for retreat on textiles


   By RACHEL JOHNSON


The European Commission is preparing for a climbdown on the harsh textile
import restrictions from China it imposed on Monday.
A meeting of the textiles committee today is likely to review both the
administration and the size of the new quotas just a few days after they
came into force - an acknowledgement that the EU substantially misjudged the
size of trade flows and the number of companies doing business with China.
Most textiles products from China, which is not a member of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, are covered by bilateral deals under the
Multi Fibre Arrangement, which controls around 70 per cent of trade in the
sector. But some products, like silk shirts, are not covered by the MFA but
are controlled under the 'autonomous regime' of national quotas.
Last Friday evening, Brussels announced the size of the new EU-wide quota
that was to replace national quotas, under single market rules, from this
Monday onwards.
Textiles companies had only the weekend to apply for import licences and
come to terms with the new quota system, which is vastly oversubscribed.
An official from the UK Trade and Industry Department said it had dealt with
and passed on 1,300 applications for quota from UK companies over the
weekend - theoretically to be allocated on a first-come-first-served basis.
Silk City, which manufacturers silk shirts in China for export to the EU,
said it alone could fill the EU quota of 5,000 tonnes for silk shirts.
In Brussels, a member of the textiles committee acknowledged that the
administration of the quotas was flawed and that 'past performance' was
likely to become the criterion upon which quotas were allocated.
