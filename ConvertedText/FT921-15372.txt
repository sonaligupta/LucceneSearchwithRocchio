FT  10 JAN 92 / Algerian women stage protest


   By AP


   ALGIERS


Several thousand women assembled in Algiers yesterday in a show of
opposition to the Islamic fundamentalists who are poised to take control of
parliament, AP writes from Algiers. 'We must fight,' Ms Khalida Messauodi, a
women's rights activist, told the crowd at a meeting hall.
The fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front, which wants to curtail the
employment of women and has criticised co-education, took an overwhelming
lead in the first round of voting two weeks ago, winning 188 of 231 seats
decided. The remaining 199 seats will be decided in the second round of
voting next Thursday.
Mr Sid Ahmed Ghozali, the prime minister whose ruling National Liberation
Front won only 15 seats in the first round, confirmed his cabinet would
resign after the second round.
