FT  24 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Redland/Steetley


Election day is fast approaching in Redland's Pounds 600m bid for Steetley.
By Thursday lunchtime the relatively small number of UK institutions that
will determine the outcome must decide whether to accept a final paper offer
worth 377p in last night's market, opt for the 365p per share cash
alternative, or cast their vote for an independent Steetley.
In many ways it is remarkable that there is still a contest. Redland has
made most of the running since Day One, leaving Steetley to grab the
headlines mainly when its luckless management stood on one of the unusually
large number of banana skins scattered in its way. The City and most
commentators wrote off the target company's chances early on, though to its
credit Steetley management stood its ground.
Redland deserves to win, but the arguments are certainly not as clear cut as
its skilfully marshalled campaign has implied. The logic of Steetley's
industrial strategy in the 1980s, for instance, has been obscured by the
attention devoted to the company's poor financial health. The dreadful and
embarrassing timing of the Pounds 40m Gobitta aggregates write-off has
overshadowed appreciation of the useful market position which Steetley has
built up in France. Steetley cannot pin all the blame for the aborted Tarmac
building materials merger on high politics in London and Brussels -
especially when it formed such a central part of the early defence - but
Redland may not be the ideal brick partner for a deep recession.
In the end, though, it will require a lot of faith to reject an offer which
only looks cheap on the basis of Steetley profit projections for the
mid-1990s, and which has not been capped by the much mooted counter-bidder.
The more pertinent question is whether to take shares or cash. Given the
continuing economic and political uncertainties, the bank may be a better
bet for the next six months.
