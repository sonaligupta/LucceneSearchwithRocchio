FT  26 OCT 92 / Economics: French joblessness rises


THE French government may ponder the disadvantages of high interest rates
this week when unemployment figures for September are released. The jobless
total may have fallen in July and August, taking the rate of unemployment to
10.2 per cent, but unemployment is still on an upward trend and is forecast
to have risen again last month.
There are few economic statistics in the UK but the Confederation of British
Industry produces its quarterly industrial trends survey and the chancellor
delivers the annual Mansion House speech.
This will be particularly important this year as Mr Norman Lamont is
expected to clarify the government's new economic policy, details of which
have been somewhat hazy ever since the prime minister declared that he was
'going for growth'.
