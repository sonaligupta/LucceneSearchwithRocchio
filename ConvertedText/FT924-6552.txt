FT  20 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rubber producers call for pact
review


   By REUTER


   SINGAPORE


NATURAL RUBBER producers want consumers to review measures to stabilise
prices, Mr Sucharit Promdej, secretary of the Association of Natural Rubber
Producing Countries, said yesterday, reports Reuter from Singapore.
'The current agreement is working well to the advantage of consumers as
prices have remained low,' said Mr Sucharit, who was attending the
International Natural Rubber Study Group's forum. He said rubber producers
wanted to review the discretionary powers of the buffer stock manager.
Council members of the International Natural Rubber Organisation, a
consumer-producer organisation, are scheduled to meet from November 23 to
December 2 in Malaysia.
At its May meeting, the Inro council failed to end a stalemate on whether
the current price-stabilising International Natural Rubber Agreement should
be reviewed.
Producers want the pact, which expires at the end of 1993, replaced, saying
it favours consumers. But consumers want the status quo maintained. 'Inro's
intervention has not made much impact,' Mr Sucharit said.
