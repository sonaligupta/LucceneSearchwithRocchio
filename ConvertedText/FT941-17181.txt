FT  06 JAN 94 / Paris set to strengthen Nato links

   PARIS, MOSCOW


France is to start sending its defence minister and chief-of-staff to Nato
meetings which have a bearing 'on the possible use of French forces or on
French interests', a senior defence official said in Paris yesterday.
This move will effectively put an end to France's boycott of Nato defence
ministers' meetings ever since the late President de Gaulle ordered Nato
headquarters out of Paris in 1966 and removed French troops from the
alliance's integrated military command.
'The French government has decided that its defence minister and
chief-of-staff can attend Nato meetings which discuss the possible use of
French forces, such as in ex-Yugoslavia or in central and eastern Europe, or
in operations involving the Western European Union,' which by the Maastricht
treaty is the intended defence arm of the European Union, according to the
official.
He predicted that French defence ministers would thus figure 'relatively
frequently' at Brussels meetings, though not necessarily at each of the
biannual meetings of the alliance's defence planning committee. France would
also like to see foreign and defence ministers of Nato countries meeting
together as they do in the WEU.
President Boris Yeltsin yesterday issued a sharp protest against Lithuania's
wish to join Nato, warning this could rekindle cold war divisions and lead
to the region's 'military and political destabilisation', writes Leyla
Boulton in Moscow.
In a statement published a day after the former Soviet republic announced it
had applied to join Nato, Mr Yeltsin's spokesman said that the president was
concerned that the expansion of Nato to include countries on Russia's border
would provoke 'a negative reaction' in Russia.
The spokesman, Mr Vyacheslav Kostikov, said the Russian president expected
Nato leaders to dispel 'an impression of ambiguity on a question which
concerns both the fate of the world and of Russia's national interests'.
