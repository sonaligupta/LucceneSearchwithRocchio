FT  15 DEC 94 / International Company News: General Mills to split food and
restaurant sides


   By CLAIRE GASCOIGNE


   NEW YORK


General Mills, the US food manufacturer and restaurant company, is to split
its business in two, writes Claire Gascoigne in New York.
The Minneapolis-based group said the consumer foods section, which accounts
for 63 per cent of the company's current Dollars 8.4bn turnover, would
retain the General Mills name.
The Dollars 3.1bn restaurant business, which includes chains such as Red
Lobster, The Olive Garden and China Coast, has yet to be named. Mr Bruce
Atwater, chairman, said separate organisations would offer better potential
for growth.
