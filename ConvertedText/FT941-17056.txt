FT  06 JAN 94 / Creativity will be brought to earth / A look at far-reaching
proposals to curtail acquisition accounting


   By ANDREW JACK


'I'll be checking the wheel nuts on my car from now on,' joked Mr David
Tweedie, chairman of the Accounting Standards Board, after unveiling tough
new proposals on the way companies account for acquisitions.
If implemented, the rules will substantially reduce the scope for companies
to manipulate profits by creating generous pre-acquisition provisions in the
balance sheet for items such as stock writedowns and reorganisation charges.
These costs by-pass the profit and loss account of the acquirer, and the
unused provisions can later be released to bolster profits.
Some even argue the new restrictions may reduce the level of acquisition
activity by British companies.
In a frenzy of activity last month, the board issued drafts of three
standards likely to change fundamentally the future shape of financial
reporting: on provisions, capital instruments and goodwill. All three
threaten some of the most favoured weapons filling the arsenal of creative
accountants in the late 1980s.
Mr Tweedie may be given to jovial turns of phrase, but behind the humour
lies serious concern at the abuses of the past - and a recognition that the
battle for reform will be difficult. He describes acquisition provisions as
the 'black hole' of British accounting. 'If I could put one thing right with
accounts this would be it,' he says.
His objection is to what he calls 'big bath' accounting, by which companies
can throw in large provisions supposedly to cover a multitude of future
expenses. These 'fair value adjustments' are placed in the reserves of the
acquirer and can be released to the profit and loss account.
Financial reporting exposure draft 7 (Fred 7) on fair values in acquisition
provisions, issued in December, toughens up the position considerably. It
restricts the scope for excessive write-downs on stock, and forbids
provisions for reorganisation and integration costs or future operating
losses.
Up till now, the scope for widespread use of pre-acquisition provisions has
been plentiful under SSAP 22, the existing accounting standard dealing with
goodwill - the difference between the net asset value and the purchase price
of an acquired business.
A classic instance is cited by Mr Terry Smith, the City analyst, in his book
'Accounting for Growth'. In the year to March 31 1989, all but Pounds 4m of
the Pounds 56m in profits of Coloroll, the collapsed home furnishings
company, came from the release of provisions rather than from its
operations.
'For two to three years after an acquisition it is damned difficult to see
where the profits are coming from,' says Mr Tweedie.
Some tightening up took place under Exposure Draft 53, the non-mandatory
guidance issued by the board's predecessor, the Accounting Standards
Committee, in 1990. It called for a ban on provisions for future earnings,
and far tighter rules on reorganisation expenses.
But the scope for substantial - though not necessarily unjust - provisions
remains. A survey by Company Reporting, the Edinburgh-based accounts
monitoring service, shows that of companies with turnover above Pounds 300m
which made acquisitions during 1991 and 1992, provisions were an average of
35 per cent of the purchase price. The table shows some examples from the
most recent accounts of large companies.
In spite of an expected lull over Christmas, the document on pre-acquisition
provisions has already begun to attract flak.
Mr Allister Wilson, a technical partner with Ernst & Young, the accountancy
firm, says: 'I think the ASB has thrown the baby out with the bathwater.
Clearly there has been wholesale abuse. Perhaps British business has only
got itself to blame.'
He argues for a compromise which would still allow scope for some
reorganisation provisions, in line with generally accepted accounting
standards in the US.
Mr Roger Davis, head of audit at Coopers & Lybrand, argues that
reorganisation expenses are a form of capital expenditure as part of the
purchase price of a company.
Some argue that the proposals may dissuade companies from making
acquisitions. However, Mr Nigel Stapleton, chief financial officer of
Reed-Elsevier and the new chairman of the 100 Group of finance directors of
leading British companies, is doubtful. 'I think this was probably a
necessary area of attention. Most companies look at acquisitions on a
cashflow basis, not for short-term earnings enhancement. Wise readers of
accounts are already looking at figures on a Fred 7 basis.
'There will be a certain amount of beating of drums, but this represents a
sensible move to what is emerging in international accounting standards,' he
says.
The ASB has made some dilutions from its earlier discussion document, which
was issued in April last year, including removal of strict requirements
forbidding any provisions being made within six months of an acquisition.
But it has been unmoved on its principal recommendations, which could be
issued in final version by the end of the year.
If pre-acquisition provisions are not enough, Tweedie warns that more is to
follow. The board is now preparing work on an accounting standard dealing
with the ordinary provisions companies make, which are also open to abuse.
