FT  06 JAN 94 / Observer: Life goes on


Being hounded from office for extramarital activities is not necessarily a
disaster. Although Tim Yeo will find circumstances a little tougher from the
loss of his Pounds 51,402 salary as minister of state for the environment,
he can of course still bank upon his MP's salary of Pounds 31,687.
He could also take a leaf out of David Mellor's book. The former heritage
minister was given sharp handling by a media pack more interested in
personal muck-raking than digging deeper into the financial and political
Westminster miasmas.
Mellor's response? To build a thriving career as an arts columnist for The
Guardian and occasional - and well paid - pundit for some parts of the very
pack which once snapped at his heels. Yeo may yet pick up the pieces and
some cheques - perhaps as golf writer for one of the tabloids.
