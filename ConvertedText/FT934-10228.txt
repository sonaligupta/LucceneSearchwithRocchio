FT  06 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Virgin Atlantic in discussions with Delta


   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent


VIRGIN Atlantic Airways is discussing a marketing alliance with Delta Air
Lines, one of the big three US carriers, as well as with Far Eastern
carriers to strengthen its long distance international network.
Virgin has refused to confirm the talks with Delta but said it was
interested in negotiating 'full marketing alliances' with international
carriers. Mr Richard Branson's airline also said that no agreements were
imminent but Virgin was hoping to secure a deal by the end of this year.
Any partnership would not involve any equity investments, added Virgin. In
recent weeks, Mr Branson had reinforced his ownership of the airline by
buying out his Japanese partner, Seibu Saison, the hotel and retailing
group, which owned a 10 per cent stake in Virgin Atlantic's parent company,
Virgin Traveller.
Delta is understood to have made the first approach to Virgin this summer.
Both airlines appear to believe that a marketing partnership including code
sharing, enabling the two carriers to use each other's ticketing codes,
could benefit them because there are no obvious conflicts.
Delta flies to London's Gatwick airport while Virgin is focusing on
Heathrow. At the same time Delta's US domestic network could feed Virgin's
services to US gateways.
Although Delta is the largest US carrier to fly across the north Atlantic,
its operations are centred at its Frankfurt European hub. Delta also has
cross equity links with Swissair and Singapore Airlines.
Virgin also confirmed yesterday that it had received 'a couple of
approaches' from Far Eastern carriers. Among possible partners is Malaysia
Airlines, the largest carrier in south east Asia, which said last month it
was planning to sign code sharing agreements with several other
international carriers in the coming months.
