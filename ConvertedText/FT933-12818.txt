FT  22 JUL 93 / Letters To The Editor: Streamlining is enough for regulatory
system


   From Sir GORDON DOWNEY


Sir, Lex suggests ('Prudential regulation', July 12) that legislation is the
only way to improve the regulation of retail financial services. It is not.
The new Personal Investment Authority can deliver higher standards of retail
regulation and crack down on fraud and malpractice. It will set tough
measures of competence for the industry as a whole and introduce a single
system for the resolution of complaints.
I am not alone in arguing this approach. A growing number of institutions
and leading industry figures take the same view. Those who call for
statutory regulation are not all seeking the same solution. The fact is that
our present regulatory structure is statute-based but benefits from the full
participation of practitioners who understand the industry in which they
operate.
We have had more direct forms of supervision by government in the past, and
these were much criticised for their ineffectiveness. Do we really want to
go down a track which has failed investors so many times before?
Five years ago the government decided to institute a system of
self-regulation and this has undeniably delivered considerable benefits for
the protection of the investing public. What is now required is a
streamlining of the present system, which will build upon the achievements
of self-regulation, while rectifying its weaknesses.
I strongly urge consumer bodies and all parts of the industry to co-operate
with us in designing the Personal Investment Authority in a way which will
command widespread confidence.
