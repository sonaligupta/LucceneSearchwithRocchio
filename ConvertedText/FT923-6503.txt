FT  24 AUG 92 / Observer: Suspicious


Having difficulty finding a room in the inn? Earlier this month Observer
passed on the Welsh Tourist Board's advice on why Japanese don't like room
44. A well-travelled colleague noted that this was only a fraction of the
story.
It's not just a Japanese problem, but a Chinese one too, and the Chinese
seem to take things a whole lot further: the hotel floors 4 and 44 are often
omitted: telephone numbers with lots of '4's in them can be a blight on a
company.
On the brighter side, numbers 8 and 9 are greatly sought after, apparently
bringing immense good luck - the Chinese for 8 rhymes with the word for
'rich', and the word for 9 sounds like the word for 'long life'. In auctions
for car registration numbers in Hong Kong, numbers 8 and 9 regularly attract
immense premiums.
Steering well clear of certain numbers seems to be by no means a Chinese or
Japanese fixation: a well known Sultan, for example, has had the number of
his London pad changed from 13 to 12 1/2 . Meanwhile, another colleague
reports that some Pakistanis don't like room 420. It is often under-utilised
because the number is said to be a code for describing crooks and swindlers.
If you have any other similar travel tips, a superstitious Observer would
like to hear them.
