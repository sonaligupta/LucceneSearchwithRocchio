FT  05 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Spirits alert


   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and ZHANG TINGTING


In a lively spirits sector, takeover talk again stalked Invergordon
Distillers and the shares climbed 9 to 279p. The focus, as always, was on
whether White and Mackay would attempt to return to the fray after its
failed bid for the group - in which it bid 275p a share - two years ago.
US-owned White and Mackay still holds a 41.3 per cent stake in Invergordon
and has never discounted rebidding. Analysts said the talk was likely to
intensify as Invergordon's results drew closer in early September.
There was also renewed talk that Highland Distilleries and IDV, Grand
Metropolitan's drinks division, would finally launch their much-rumoured
Pounds 100m bid for North British Distillery, an Edinburgh-based distiller
of grain whisky.
North British, an unquoted company with 600 shareholders, announced in May
that it had received a bid approach. However, in spite of plenty of
speculation there have been no further developments. Highland advanced 11 to
339p and GrandMet 3 to 416p.
Stores produced another mixed bag, with Boots turning in a strong
performance, buoyed by a positive note from SG Warburg. The shares jumped 15
to 474p in turnover of 4.8m. There was said to be some switching out of
Kingfisher, which has recently had a strong run on the back of French rate
cut hopes. The shares shed 9 to 637p. Goldman Sachs was rumoured to have
moved from 'buy' to 'hold'.
Talk of tough trading at Northern Food's agm saw the shares slip 4 1/2 to
264 1/2 p.
Second line food retailers tried some catching up. Shoprite Group moved
ahead 7 to 165p, Iceland 6 to 226p and Morrison 4 to 149p.
Chemicals group BOC improved ahead of third-quarter results due next
Tuesday. Hoare Govett is a buyer and forecasts profits of Pounds 260m,
against Pounds 250m for the same period last year. The shares appreciated 9
to 691p.
Reed International, whose interests range from legal and business
publications to consumer magazines and local and regional newspapers, took
up much of the stage in the quiet publishing sector yesterday as the market
cautiously awaited the group's interim results, due today.
These will be the first profits reported since the merger with Elsevier at
the beginning of the year. Only 620,000 shares were traded with the price
firming 3 to 664p on market expectations of pre-tax profits between Pounds
267m and Pounds 275m.
Analysts admitted that they were operating in the dark as no comparison
could be drawn against previous figures. But the combined group, which still
maintains separate stock exchange listings, has strengthened its presence in
Europe and increased its stake in such high margin areas as scientific
publishing through the merger. Hoare Govett said that the progress of the
merger and current trading conditions would prove the keys to movements in
the shares today.
United Newspapers, which has risen for two consecutive trading days, shed 3
to 551p on modest profit-taking and realisation that the overall interest
rate cuts in Europe might not come as soon as the market has been expecting.
News International continued to move forward, adding 6 at 238p, reflecting
the market's confidence in its newly purchased stake in the fast-growing
Asia.
In the printing sector, news of orders from the Daily Mirror for new
supplements helped Hunterprint Group appreciate 3 to 45p.
William Baird, the textile group, ended 3 higher at 266p.
