   NEW YORK


ZALE Corporation, the world's largest jewellery retailer which in January
sought protection from its creditors under chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy
code, last week filed a reorganisation plan with the Dallas courts.
The move came as Zale revealed net losses of Dollars 960m for the year to
end-March, compared with losses of Dollars 54m in the previous 12 months.
However, the losses were struck after a Dollars 811m provision for asset
write-downs and restructuring expenses associated with the bankruptcy. Sales
last year totalled Dollars 1.16bn, compared with Dollars 1.33bn.
The official creditors' committee is supporting the plan, along with banks
and trade creditors. Under the plan, Zale's operating subsidiaries would be
consolidated and much of the group's debt would be swapped for equity in the
reorganised business.
Zale also said Swarovski International, a big shareholder in Zale since
1986, is 'very interested' in participating in the reorganisation.
'Swarovski has advised Zale that it would like to purchase a substantial
amount of equity in the reorganised company,' said the Dallas-based company.
SIH is a Zurich-based vehicle for the wealthy Austrian Swarovski family, The
other leading shareholder in Zale is Peoples Jewellers of Toronto.
