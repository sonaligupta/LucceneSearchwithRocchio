FT  29 APR 94 / UK Company News: GEC offer for Ferranti units cleared


   By BERNARD GRAY


GEC's purchase of parts of Ferranti International will not be referred to
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, as the Office of Fair Trading has
concluded that the deal did not raise competition concerns, writes Bernard
Gray.
GEC agreed to buy Ferranti's defence systems integration business and its
training and simulation business from the receivers on March 30.
It is thought to have offered about Pounds 100m for the two businesses. GEC
is thought to be interested in Ferranti's 50 per cent stake in a sonar joint
venture with Thomson, the French electronics company.
Ferranti's systems integration business designs command and control systems
for ships and air defence.
