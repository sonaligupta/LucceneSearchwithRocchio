FT  22 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Telegraph


If Cazenove thought its resignation as Mr Conrad Black's broker would put an
end to its embarrassment over its role in placing a large slug of the media
magnate's Telegraph shares, it was mistaken. Mr Black's reputation was badly
damaged by the defection. His extraordinary broadside in an interview with
the FT seems designed to knock Cazenove's reputation in return.
It is unlikely that investors who bought the shares will have much truck
with Mr Black's arguments. The Telegraph's decision to join the newspaper
price war shortly after the share placement left them nursing huge losses.
Cazenove's resignation was a damage limitation exercise apparently designed
to placate investors' wrath and so protect its valuable share placing
franchise.
The danger for Cazenove is that Mr Black's accusation that the broker
'scurried out of the back door into the tall grass' could unsettle its other
customer base - corporate clients. If Mr Black's interpretation of events is
accurate, Cazenove was not too fussed when first told that the Telegraph
planned to slash its cover price. It was only after it experienced the full
force of the City's revulsion at what had happened that it resigned
abruptly. Cazenove may, of course, have full answers to these criticisms.
But so long as it maintains its famed policy of not commenting about its
business, doubts will remain.
