FT  24 MAR 92 / UK Company News: TT acquires 7.5% stake in ML Holdings


TT Group, the acquisitive industrial holding company, yesterday announced
that it had acquired a 7.5 per cent shareholding (3.75m shares) in ML
Holdings, the aerospace, cargo handling and electronic component
manufacturer.
The move, which sent ML shares up by 7p to 28p, comes a week after TT
announced that it had acquired a 4.6 per cent stake in Renold, the power
transmission equipment maker.
That announcement elicited a sharp response from Renold which accused TT of
attempting to acquire it 'on the cheap'. Renold closed 1p lower at 63p
yesterday.
In January ML turned in a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.31m for the half year
ended September 1990, compared with a profit of Pounds 3.03m previously.
TT is due to announce its results for 1991 today. For the first six months
pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 4.64m to Pounds 6.77m.
