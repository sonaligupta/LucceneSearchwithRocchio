FT  17 JAN 92 / Big rise in attacks on foreigners in Germany


   By REUTER


   BERLIN


THE number of attacks on foreigners in Germany increased tenfold in 1991 to
2,368, according to a confidential government report disclosed by a Berlin
newspaper yesterday, Reuter reports from Berlin.
'The drastic increase has led to serious unease among asylum-seeking and
(resident) foreigners in Germany,' the report said. The problem has prompted
a police crackdown on neo-Nazi gangs and greater effort to protect
foreigners.
The report recorded hundreds of fire bombings of hostels for asylum-seekers
as well as physical assaults on individuals. It said most of the culprits
were neo-Nazi skinheads and right-wing high school students, apprentices or
unemployed young people.
