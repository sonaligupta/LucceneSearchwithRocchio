Sir Paul Girolami received almost Pounds 1.5m in pay in his final year as

Sir Paul stepped down as chairman at the end of the company's financial year
on June 30, having worked at Glaxo for 29 years.
The annual report also shows that Mr Arthur Pappas, who was the director
responsible for Canada and Latin America until his departure in February
1994 over 'differences in management approach and style', is likely to
receive more than Dollars 2m in a contract termination payment, salary and
other benefits, over three years.
The salary of the second highest paid director was Pounds 930,000 last year,

The report shows that 'payments for termination of executive office'
amounted to Pounds 1.04m with another Pounds 1.09m paid to former directors
in performance-related pay and pension contributions. Most of this was
payable to former chief executive, Dr Ernest Mario.
