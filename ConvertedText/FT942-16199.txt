FT  12 APR 94 / Group's state indicated by 1992 accounts


   By ANDREW JACK


Lancer Boss Group is already more than two months late in filing its 1993
accounts, according to documents filed with Companies House.
The latest financial information available with the government's corporate
information agency dates from the year-end to March 31 1992.
The 1992 accounts highlight some of the difficulties facing the company and
the challenges that will be faced by its receivers. They show the group made
losses of Pounds 3.1m, against pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.4m in the
previous year. Operating profits declined from Pounds 9.9m to Pounds 2.1m in
the same period.
Total borrowings at the balance sheet date in 1992 were Pounds 32m. The
proportionately high interest costs of Pounds 5.9m suggest borrowings may
have been considerably higher earlier in the year. The company is relatively
stretched in servicing its borrowings. Net cash flow from operating
activities was only Pounds 6.4m, barely covering the Pounds 5.9m in interest
costs.
The chairman's statement says 'a large part' of the company's investments
are in D-Marks, while Germany also accounts for a large share of its
operations. However, it refuses to comply with the accounting standard
requiring a geographical breakdown of profits and assets, so all that is
available is turnover of Pounds 86m from a total for the group of Pounds
192m.
The German subsidiary's pension fund was only 89 per cent funded during the
year, suggesting that the current estimated costs of pensions cannot be
covered.
The accounting policies on leasing are confused, while the note on turnover
policy is unusual and may allow for considerable flexibility. Turnover is
recognised when 'final arrangements have been made for shipments.'
Sir Neville Bowman Shaw, the chairman, was paid Pounds 455,000 and one other
director more than Pounds 305,000. All the shares are held by Sir Neville,
other members of his family and trustees on their behalf.
The accounts received an unqualified opinion by KPMG Peat Marwick, which
charged an audit fee of Pounds 362,000. The company donated Pounds 13,000 to
the Conservative party and Pounds 12,500 to charities in 1992.
