FT  27 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Barclays boosted


   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and PETER JOHN


Stockbroker Hoare Govett was the driving force behind the good showing by
Barclays Bank shares. Hoare's banks team upgraded its current year profits
forecast from Pounds 350m to Pounds 550m, because of what it sees as a
continuing improvement in the bank's operating performance.
'We see the bank's bad debts substantially lower this year,' said Mr Steven
Thorn at Hoare. He rates Barclays shares '20 per cent cheaper than those of
National Westminster and with better dividend growth prospects', and told
clients to switch out of NatWest and into Barclays.
Barclays shares continued the rehabilitation which began after the group
upset the market by halving the final dividend and reporting deeply
disappointing results in March. The stock price, which plummeted to 392p
after the dividend cut, touched 462p yesterday before coming off the top to
close 2 firmer at 459p on keen turnover of 5.1m.
