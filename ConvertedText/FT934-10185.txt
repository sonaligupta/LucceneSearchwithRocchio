FT  06 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Greycoat


The UK Active Value Fund's restructuring proposals for Greycoat are very
similar to those made by Postel. The crucial difference is that the offer
acknowledges the crude balance of power among investors, sweetening the
terms for those who blocked the previous proposal and inflicting more pain
on those who have no choice. Preference shareholders and bondholders
naturally do better. But the deal is less generous to ordinary shareholders.
Yet with Greycoat's zero coupon bondholders having served a default notice,
receivership does loom on the horizon if the restructuring fails. Ordinary
shareholders would then be buried at the bottom of the heap.
Assuming the restructuring goes ahead, Greycoat will emerge as a highly
geared company with a few attractive trophy properties and reasonable scope
for rental growth in the rest of its portfolio. Given the current hunger of
institutional investors for property shares, there could be an active market
in the nil paid rights. Greycoat has already started muttering ambitiously
about recommencing speculative developments by 1995. Incredible though that
would have sounded a year ago, it does not seem so far-fetched today. It
would take remarkable forgiveness - or a particularly forgetful memory - to
back Greycoat's incumbent management in that game again. Still, that is a
worry for another day.
