   By REUTER


   SOFIA


BULGARIA unveiled a tough austerity budget yesterday, saying it was tailored
to please the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF), Reuter
reports from Sofia.
The draft budget, which provoked heated debates in parliament, proposes a
deficit of 9.2bn leva (Pounds 226.5m), or 4.3 per cent of gross domestic
product (GDP).
Last year's budget deficit turned out to be 8.5bn leva, or about 3.9 per
cent of GDP. It was originally set at 7.5bn leva.
'The budget has been drawn up in line with the IMF and the World Bank, and
fulfils their recommendations,' the finance minister, Mr Ivan Kostov, told
parliament.
Bulgaria, whose economy contracted 20-25 per cent last year and which has
Dollars 11.5bn of foreign debt, needs IMF blessing to attract foreign
investment and reach agreements with bank creditors.
