FT  05 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Non-executive directors' input is
invaluable


   From Sir DAVID PLASTOW


Sir, I am second to none in my admiration of Sir Owen Green's remarkable
leadership of BTR, but I was disturbed by some of the statements he made
during the Pall Mall Lecture on UK corporate governance last week, as quoted
in your article 'Cadbury Critique' (February 25).
Sir Owen's lack of enthusiasm for non-executive directors is clearly the
exception that makes the rule in the context of BTR's splendid financial
record.
In his own words, Sir Owen is a 'pre-Cadbury practitioner', and may I
suggest that he lacks any real experience of non-executive director
contributions to company success. Having myself served on several listed
company boards on both sides of the Atlantic I must say that to suggest that
non-executive directors 'must blunt the competitive edge and deflect the
entrepreneurial drive which characterises participation, let alone success
in a free market' is ill-informed nonsense.
On several occasions I have been involved with change at the level of
chairman and chief executive which was greatly welcomed by executive
colleagues who were unable to initiate the necessary action.
More importantly, in all my experience the outside board directors have
demonstrably broadened the vision of the board and, above all, encouraged
entrepreneurial drive and development of the company.
