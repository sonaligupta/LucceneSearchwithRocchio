FT  22 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Airways alert


   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO


Turnover in British Airways rose to a hefty 12m to make it the day's most
heavily traded stock as the shares relinquished 3 to 431p on fears of
increased losses at USAir and state aid for a European rival.
BA holds a 24.6 per cent stake in USAir, which reported improved
second-quarter net profits late on Wednesday. However, sentiment was hit
yesterday by a press report suggesting that the higher profits disguised
'its dreadful plight'.
Further concern arose from reports that the European Commission was about to
agree a state aid package for rival Air France of about FF20bn, around 60
per cent of BA's market value, a move seen by some as distorting
competition.
Mr Zafar Khan at Strauss Turnbull said, however, that BA had little to fear
from stiffer competition since 'it is one of the lowest cost airlines in
Europe'.
