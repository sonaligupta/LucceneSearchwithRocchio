FT  13 NOV 92 / Unemployment rises to 2.87m


   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff


UNEMPLOYMENT rose by less than expected last month, but the number of people
out of work and claiming benefit reached its highest level for 5 1/2 years.
The government will have been heartened, however, by another fall in average
earnings growth to its lowest level since 1967.
The seasonally adjusted rise of 24,200 in unemployment last month took the
total to 2.87m, a level last seen in May 1987.
Although the rise was the smallest since June, another drop in vacancies
suggested that further big losses are likely before the end of the year.
Vacancies at Jobcentres, which account for about a third of all vacancies,
fell by 2,500 last month to 97,600, the lowest level for 11 years.
The number of people without work has risen by more than 1.2m in the 30
months since unemployment started to rise. The number is estimated to be
growing at a rate of between 30,000 and 35,000 a month with the latest
increase leaving the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate at 10.1 per cent.
Unadjusted, the employment figures fell by 32,954 to just over 2.8m.
Mr Frank Dobson, shadow employment secretary, said: 'Britain has now
suffered 2 1/2 years of unrelenting job losses, and up to now the government
hasn't raised a finger to help.'
Mr Michael Forsyth, employment minister, predicted that more jobs would be
created when businesses were able to take advantage of the lower interest
rates, and denied that general election pledges on improving the economy
were being broken.
One explanation for the lower-than-expected rise in October was that people
unable to find jobs enrolled on further education courses. This would
disqualify them from the official figures which count only those who are
claiming benefit as unemployed.
In the year to September, average earnings grew by 5.5 per cent, a fall of
0.25 per cent on the August figure. This compares with growth in average
earnings of 7.75 per cent a year ago.
Employment in manufacturing continued to fall. In September it dropped by a
seasonally adjusted 32,000, a smaller fall than in August. However, 128,000
manufacturing jobs were lost in the third quarter compared with losses of
only 50,000 and 18,000 in the first and second quarters respectively. There
are now 4.4m people employed in manufacturing in the UK compared with a peak
of 7.9m in June 1971.
Both male and female unemployment rose in October. The annual rate for men
was 13.6 per cent compared with 13.4 per cent in September. For women the
rate rose to 5.5 per cent, unchanged on the previous month.
Unemployment rose in every region except Northern Ireland. The biggest rise
was in the south-east including greater London. The rise of 6,100 took the
rate of unemployment in the south-east to 11.2 per cent, the third-highest
rate in the country after Northern Ireland (14.7 per cent) and the north
(11.6 per cent).
According to the latest international comparisons of unemployment compiled
by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the
unemployment rate in the UK was 10.2 per cent in September, equal to the
rate in France, but lower than that in the Republic of Ireland, Spain,
Finland, Canada and Australia. In all the other main industrialised nations
unemployment rate is lower than the UK's.
