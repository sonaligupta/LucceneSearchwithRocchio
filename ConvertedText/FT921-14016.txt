FT  17 JAN 92 / International Company News: Continental in the red despite
good quarter


   By ALAN FRIEDMAN


   NEW YORK


CONTINENTAL BANK, the Chicago-based group which had to be rescued by federal
authorities eight years ago, yesterday reported a Dollars 76m loss for 1991
despite a return to the black in the fourth quarter of the year. Net income
for the whole of 1990 was Dollars 75m.
The bank's Dollars 50m net profit in the last quarter came after Dollars
126m of losses in the first nine months. Mr Tom Theobald, chairman, called
the last quarter result 'a promising finish to a year in which we completed
our restructuring'.
Continental said its bad debt provisions were Dollars 222m higher in 1991,
at Dollars 340m. In the fourth quarter, these provisions amounted to Dollars
30m, down from Dollars 48m in the last quarter of 1990. Net loan write-offs
in the whole of 1991 totalled Dollars 223m, compared with Dollars 87m in
1990.
Non-performing loans at the year-end increased by 7 per cent on the 12-month
period to Dollars 733m, but they were 19 per cent down on the September 30
level. At the year-end, non-performing loans represented 5.28 per cent of
Continental's total loan book.
Continental has cut its workforce from around 10,000 in 1987 to just over
5,000. The bank has focused increasingly on corporate business.
