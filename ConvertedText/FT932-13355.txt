FT  23 APR 93 / UK Company News: Austin Reed stages recovery to Pounds 1.22m


   By MAGGIE URRY


THE proposed enfran-chisement of Austin Reed's non-voting shares
overshadowed results yesterday which showed a recovery in pre-tax profits
from Pounds 810,000 to Pounds 1.22m over the year to January 31 after a loss
at the interim stage of Pounds 430,000.
The group, chaired by Mr Barry Reed, saw sales from continuing businesses
little changed at Pounds 58.7m (Pounds 58.6m), though in total there was a
fall from Pounds 65.8m.
The profit recovery was after a fall in interest charges to Pounds 1.65m
(Pounds 2.44m) and the absence of an exceptional charge (Pounds 633,000).
But profits in the comparable period included an unquantified contribution
from businesses sold.
A maintained final dividend of 3p is proposed, for a total of 5p (6p).
Earnings per share were 3p (0.7p).
Mr Chris Thomson, finance director, said the dividend decision signalled the
board was sufficiently encouraged by an improvement in trading to pay an
uncovered dividend. He said the spring season had started better.
The proposal to enfranchise the 90.5 per cent of shares which do not have
votes will be put to the annual meeting in June. Holders of voting shares
will be offered a 1-for-1 scrip in compensation, effectively doubling their
dividend entitlement. However, they will have only 17.3 per cent of the
votes in the enlarged share capital.
Mr Thomson said the proposal had been entirely at the company's instance and
did not result from pressure from shareholders. While the group is not
planning a rights issue, moving to a unified share structure would help the
company to take opportunities.
He said Austin Reed had worked hard to get the balance sheet into shape, had
cut costs and sold non-core businesses. It had come through recession and
had a new chief executive. Now it had the infrastructure to cope with more
activity than it could grow organically, and bolt-on acquisitions or
partnerships could be in prospect.
The balance sheet showed net debt down from Pounds 11.2m to Pounds 8.3m.
However, a reduction in property values from Pounds 29m to Pounds 17m, and a
transfer from reserves of Pounds 563,000 (Pounds 1.5m) cut shareholders
funds to Pounds 40.5m (Pounds 53.2m) leaving gearing little changed at 20.4
per cent.
