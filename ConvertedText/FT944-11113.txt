FT  08 NOV 94 / Financial cost of poor housing


Poor housing is costing an estimated Pounds 2bn a year in medical bills,
social help and police time, a report said yesterday.
The report from the Standing Conference on Public Health, a group of 37
health and housing organisations, says accidents, illnesses, and distress
arising from cold, damp conditions impose this financial burden.
