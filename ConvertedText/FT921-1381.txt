FT  24 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Linread's Pounds 2.2m loss as exceptionals
take toll


   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent


LINREAD, the Birmingham-based manufacturer of fasteners and components for
the aerospace and motor industries, fell into losses in 1991. Turnover
dipped Pounds 3m to Pounds 39.7m.
The pre-tax deficit, struck after sizeable exceptional charges, was Pounds
2.2m, compared with profits of Pounds 2.08m in the previous year and a first
half profit this time of Pounds 126,000. Losses per share were 13.84p
compared with earnings of 11.07p.
Nevertheless, a final dividend of 1.5p is proposed, bringing the total to
3.5p (5.7p). Mr Peter Tahany, chairman, said the payment 'is basically an
expression of confidence.'
This follows elimination of loss-making activities, including the North
Bridge Hassall subsidiary in the US and a fasteners factory in the UK, at an
exceptional cost of Pounds 2.86m.
It also springs from the turnround in the commercial products division, of
which fasteners are a part. In 1991, it incurred trading losses of Pounds
1.47m but in the first two months of this year has been trading at a slender
profit.
The company is expecting higher earnings to flow from a reduced cost base,
but Mr Tahany is taking a cautious view of demand this year from the
aerospace market, hitherto the main source of profits, where British
Aerospace is a leading customer. However, on the engine side, he noted that
Linread had been designated as a preferred supplier by Pratt & Whitney, the
US engine manufacturer.
Mr Tahany was more optimistic about demand from the motor industry.
