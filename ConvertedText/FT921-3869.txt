FT  12 MAR 92 / UK Company News: All-round growth boosts BWD


   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent


GROWTH IN all its sectors helped BWD Securities, the USM-quoted financial
services group, report pre-tax profits more than doubled to Pounds 2.07m,
against Pounds 849,000 which included an exceptional charge of Pounds
201,000.
Turnover advanced 28 per cent from Pounds 7.85m to Pounds 10m. The pre-tax
figure included interest received of Pounds 652,000 (Pounds 673,000).
Mr Christopher Broadbent, the chief executive of the Huddersfield-based
company, said that privatisation brought a surge in volume of transactions,
but values and margins were low.
Because privatisation could not be relied on in future, the group was
building its recurring fee base to secure profitability. Recurring fee
income was Pounds 1.2m last year, compared with Pounds 900,000 in 1990.
'We know we still have a long way to go, but many stockbrokers have none at
all, so we are quite happy to reveal the figures,' Mr Broadbent said.
The group operates the BWD Rensburg stockbroking company and Capital for
Companies, the Leeds venture capital arm. J Douglas McDonald, which provides
personal financial planning services and administrates pension funds, was
acquired during the year and renamed BWD McDonald.
Capital for Companies launched its ninth BES fund - it has run one per year
since the scheme started - and is also sponsoring another assured tenancy
issue. Realisations for the first three funds had shown excellent returns,
BWD said.
Mr Broadbent said the planned abolition of BES at the end of next year,
announced in the Budget, would provide a surge of activity in the next 18
months. Capital for Companies was already involved in conventional venture
capital activities for the future.
BWD also owns Northern Registrars, now the tenth largest in the UK and
providing registration services for more than 70,000 shareholders. In
September it acquired Yorkshire Registrars and the business and some assets
of Crossley House Registrars. Since the year-end on November 30, Northern
has acted for one client in a Pounds 99m rights issue.
Earnings per share more than doubled from the low 1990 base of only 3p to
7.6p. A proposed final dividend of 1.7p (0.75p) will bring the total for the
year to 3p (1.75p).
