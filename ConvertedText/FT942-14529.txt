FT  20 APR 94 / Demand for executives rises


   By RICHARD DONKIN


Demand for executives has sharpened markedly, says the latest quarterly
survey by MSL, the recruitment consultant, Richard Donkin writes.
The number of executive job vacancies advertised in quality national
newspapers rose by 30 per cent in the first three months of this year, says
the survey, which is published today.
The rise reflects an upward trend in the past three quarters.
Vacancies rose 22 per cent compared with the same period a year earlier.
Recruitment has become a useful economic indicator.
The MSL report shows that advertised demand for executives between January
and March was the highest in that period for three years, but it was still
running at only slightly more than half its 1990 level.
Retailing recruitment showed some of the most marked activity with a 25 per
cent increase on the quarter and a rise of 67 per cent on the year before.
Executive advertisements in high-tech industries more than doubled compared
with the year before.
Advertised accounting and finance posts rose 42 per cent in the January to
March period compared with the previous quarter, and were 11 per cent up on
the year.
Marketing and sales posts rose 29 per cent on the year.
