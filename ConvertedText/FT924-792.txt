FT  22 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Lasmo


To be charitable, Lasmo's disposal of peripheral assets at least
demonstrates that oilfields can still fetch reasonable prices. Lasmo has
also continued to cut deals in a difficult market. And the company has raked
in some much-needed cash, giving the management more leeway to maintain its
final dividend if it so desires.
Yet, however helpful, pulling in Dollars 145m will not lift the company's
heavy debt burden. Exploration and development spending will fall next year,
but Lasmo must still make further disposals if borrowings are not to rise
once more. That underlines the conundrum facing the company, which was
caught with high gearing when asset values started to fall. Its most
saleable assets are precisely those which would provide the short-term cash
flow to service its debt burden. So to cut its gearing, the company is
selling part of its future.
The bind is all the tighter because crude oil prices show little sign of
rising above Dollars 20 a barrel. As a result the oil industry is having to
cut costs sharply. Efficiency gains from integrating Ultramar are needed if
Lasmo is simply to stand still. Short-term prospects for the share price may
be torn between the attractions of a 7.5 per cent yield, and fears that the
payment cannot be sustained forever. The company really needs a buoyant oil
price.
