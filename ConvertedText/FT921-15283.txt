FT  10 JAN 92 / Observer: Family line


Baron Marcel Bich yesterday put the cap on speculation about the future of
one of France's most secretive family companies by naming his son Bruno to
succeed him as chairman of Bic, the world's largest maker of ball-point
pens.
While the 77-year-old founder will continue to head the French-based parent
company for the time being, Bruno - his second son and the third of his 11
children - is being prepared to take over by promotion to the chairmanship
of the US subsidiary.
The move continues a cherished tradition of father-to-son handovers in
French business. Other family groups which have taken or are taking the same
line include Bouygues, Dassault, Michelin, Hachette, Matra, and Club
Mediterranee. The results do not seem much different from those of
non-family competitors, perhaps because most of the sons involved have
worked their way through the business.
This is certainly true of Bruno Bich, now 45, a former banker who joined the
company two decades ago. The group might even benefit from some fresh ideas,
since the Baron's attempts to seek new sources of growth, beyond its
traditional pens, disposable razors and lighters businesses, have fallen
below expectations. A diversification into perfumes had to be scuppered last
year, while a Bic sailboard business is in the doldrums.
