FT  28 APR 94 / People: Proteus International


Proteus International, a UK biotechnology company that uses computers to
design drugs, has appointed Jurek Sikorski as business development and
marketing director.
Biotechnology companies usually spend many years developing products before
they can be sold, and Sikorski's appointment reflects Proteus' confidence
that some of its 30 development programmes will come to fruition shortly.
Ten products are scheduled to be in clinical trials or the veterinary
equivalent by the end of the year. The first product, an anti-diarrhoea
treatment for cattle, should be on sale later this year, says Proteus.
Sikorski, 42, comes from healthcare group Smith and Nephew, where he was
international marketing director. Previously, he worked in marketing for
Wellcome Diagnostics and UK biotechnology company Celltech, where he was
chief executive of a US subsidiary called Boots- Celltech Diagnostics.
