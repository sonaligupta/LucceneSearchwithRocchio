FT  06 AUG 93 / International Company News: Schering ahead at halfway mark

   BERLIN


SCHERING, the Berlin-based pharmaceutical and agrochemicals company,
yesterday announced a 3 per cent profit increase for the first six months of
the year.
In spite of restructuring costs, the company expects this year's earnings to
match those for 1992.
Group sales fell by 1.7 per cent to DM2.87bn (Dollars 1.7bn) from last
year's comparative DM2.82bn. The lower turnover was partly affected by the
appreciation of other European currencies against the D-Mark, as well as
sales of operations shed by the company over the past year.
As expected, domestic sales in the pharmaceutical sector continued to be
depressed because of recent government health reforms which include a new
pricing system for medicines. Domestic sales rose 1 per cent to DM1.99bn.
Foreign sales increased to DM2.32bn from DM2.30bn.
The sharp decline in sales in the agrochemical sector, which fell 22 per
cent during the first quarter of this year, has slowed down. For the first
six months of this year, they fell 8.2 per cent to DM786m, compared with the
same period last year.
Schering announced that its shareholders would vote on December 15 for the
planned merger of its agrochemical division with Hoeschst, the country's
large chemical group.
