FT  26 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Kazakhstan moves to promote its
chrome and ferro-alloys


   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent


KAZAKHSTAN'S CHROME and ferro-alloys industry, which is being widely blamed
for the low prices causing havoc in western markets, has formed a new
organisation, with some help from western traders, to defend and promote its
interests internationally.
This move comes at a time when it is widely expected in the industry that
the European Commission will shortly impose anti-dumping duties on imports
of ferro-silicon into the community from several countries.
Called the International Chromium Committee of Kazakhstan, the new
organisation's membership includes senior officials from the Donskoye mining
complex near Khromtau, reputed to have the biggest chrome mine in the world
with an annual output of 3m tonnes of ore, and the Yermak ferro-alloy plant,
which produces about 600,000 tonnes of ferro-silicon and 400,000 tonnes of
ferro-chrome a year.
Also involved in the new organisation is the New York-based trading company
AIOC Corporation.
Mr Elliot Spitz, executive vice-president of AIOC, said the move indicated
that the Kazakhstan industry was resisting approaches for it to join with
some western producers and had decided to take an independent direction.
This followed meetings between Kazakhstan officials and US stainless steel
companies recently.
'We are seeing a reorganisation of the basic industries of the former Soviet
Union with associations being formed at national and regional levels.
Various friendly western organisations are helping to establish these
organisations,' said Mr Spitz.
AIOC is also a member of the International Aluminium Committee set up last
month by the Commonwealth of Independent States.
