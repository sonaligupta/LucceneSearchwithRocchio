FT  27 SEP 94 / Italian pension row simmers


   By ROBERT GRAHAM


   ROME


The government of prime minister Silvio Berlusconi last night failed to
bridge the gap with the trade unions over reforming Italy's costly pension
scheme as part of the 1995 budget. After more than two hours of late night
talks, it was decided to adjourn until this afternoon. The two sides have
little time left to reach an agreement as the government has to submit the
1995 budget to parliament by Friday. The three main union confederations
have threatened to call a general strike on proposed cuts in the pension
system; but this, the fourth failed meeting, suggests both sides are still
seeking a compromise.
One of the sticking points appears to be the unions' refusal to accept a
change in the number of years' contributions from 35 to 40. They are also
insisting on a clear distinction between the problem of pension payments -
based on contributions - and general welfare payments, which should come
from taxes. At present, both welfare and pension payments are funded from a
mix of contributions, taxes and treasury transfers covering deficits.
