FT  15 JUN 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report


   By REUTER


Base metal trading was extremely slow today at the London Metal Exchange,
and only COPPER swam against the ebb tide of prices. Three months delivery
copper moved above Dollars 1,850 a tonne in late trading, and dealers said
the market looked set to test overhead resistance today. There was
speculative support below current levels, they said, and short-covering was
likely to appear on any dips. The months TIN managed to clamber back above
the recent 20-year low of Dollars 5,150 a tonne, which was equalled early in
the day, but seemed destined to break lower, as producer resolve to limit
exports was weakening, dealers said. ALUMINIUM prices also fell back,
although support appeared to have been found at Dollars 1,170 a tonne, for
the three months contract. At the London Futures and Options Exchange COCOA
futures extended earlier losses during the afternoon session amid
disappointed long liquidation after the recent failed attempt at an upside
break-out. Robusta COFFEE futures tested both ends of the current trading
band, finishing at the upper end of the range.
