6% advance

CREDIT AGRICOLE, the French farmers' co-operative bank, defied the trend of
its competitors by yesterday announcing a 6 per cent increase in net profit
to FFr5.2bn (Dollars 959m) last year.
With FFr1,560bn deposits, or 20 per cent of the total in France at the end
of last year, Credit Agricole confirmed its leading position.
Increased profits came from an 8.2 per cent rise in net banking income and
only a 4.2 per cent rise in general costs.
Credit Agricole is still the provider of 80 per cent of all bank loans to
France's farmers.
Roussel-Uclaf, the French pharmaceutical group controlled by Hoechst of
Germany, has reported pre-tax profits of FFr357m, up from FFr123m for the
first three months to 31 March, writes Paul Abrahams in London.
The results were achieved on turnover of FFr3.992bn against FFr3.806bn for
the same period last year. Cash-flow increased from FFr264m to FFr286m.
