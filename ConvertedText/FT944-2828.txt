FT  15 DEC 94 / Union Carbide to buy ICI works


Imperial Chemical Industries is to sell its ethylene oxide plant at Wilton,
Teesside, to Union Carbide, the US chemicals group.
Under the cash deal, due to be announced imminently, ICI will contract to
buy some of the plant's output from Union Carbide. The price paid by Union
Carbide is thought to amount to less than 1 per cent of ICI's assets.
Ethylene Oxide is a raw material for ICI's surfactants operation, one of its
fastest growing businesses, which makes chemicals for use in soaps and
shampoos, and chemicals for pesticides.
Mr Ronnie Hampel, ICI chief executive, said earlier this year that he was
considering selling stakes in the Wilton complex. ICI would never again
build a new ethylene plant, he said.
The company is thought to have been in talks with Union Carbide since the
spring. Union Carbide is believed to be committed to increasing the plant's
capacity as part of the deal. The sale will be the latest in a series of
disposals by ICI of businesses on the Wilton site over the past few years.
