New car sales in Japan posted the first year-on-year increase in 14 months
during June, according to the Japan Automobile Dealers' Association, writes
Steven Butler in Tokyo. The increase was small, just 0.5 per cent, but was
none the less the first hopeful sign the industry has seen in many months.
Passenger car sales were down by 0.2 per cent to 343,065 units, with
sub-compact cars off by 4 per cent. Sales of larger cars rose by 19.4 per
cent to 67,088 units.
