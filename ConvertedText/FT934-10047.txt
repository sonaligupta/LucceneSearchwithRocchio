FT  08 NOV 93 / TUC raps abolition of farm wage protection


   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff


THE GOVERNMENT has been warned that nearly a quarter of a million farm
workers in England and Wales would face poverty and exploitation if it
abolished the Agricultural Wages Board.
The warning was delivered in a Trades Union Congress submission to the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food after the ministry published a
consultative document on the future of the board.
The TUC dismissed government claims that statutory fixing of wages destroyed
jobs as an excuse to remove the only protection available to what the TUC
said was the poorest group of workers.
The submission called for stiffer penalties against employers who break the
law by paying less than the board's rates.
The TUC said that it was concerned about the falling number of
investigations against employers in the past 10 years in an area where farm
workers constituted the biggest single industrial group claiming income
support.
One of the first national hotel chains to agree an annual pay rise since the
abolition of wages councils in August has announced a rise marginally above
the level that the wages council had planned to recommend.
Stakis Hotels has raised its minimum rate to Pounds 3 an hour compared with
the planned recommendation of Pounds 2.99.
