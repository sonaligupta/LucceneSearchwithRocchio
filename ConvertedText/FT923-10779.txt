FT  29 JUL 92 / Anger over delay to Lloyd's loss report


   By RICHARD LAPPER


LLOYD'S NAMES have reacted angrily to news of a further delay in the
publication of a report into losses of at least Pounds 450m by the Feltrim
syndicates.
Sir Patrick Neill, who has been investigating the losses of two syndicates
formerly managed by the Feltrim agency, had been expected to present his
conclusions to Lloyd's Council, the insurance market's governing body, next
week.
However, Mr David Coleridge, Lloyd's chairman, has indicated that Sir
Patrick's report, which is being conducted in accordance with the market's
loss review procedures, will not be available until September.
Mr Colin Hook, chairman of the Feltrim Names Association, said: 'I was
appalled to learn of the delay. Frankly, I would like to have seen the
report out six months ago.'
Feltrim syndicates 540 and 847 specialised in catastrophe reinsurance
business and have been overwhelmed by claims from hurricane Hugo and other
disasters. More than 1,500 Names - the individuals whose assets back
underwriting at Lloyd's - are affected by losses.
Possible legal action by Names to recover losses has been held up, pending
publication of the report. Mr Hook said a number of his association's
members were already facing bankruptcy.
The Feltrim review is the first of a number launched by Lloyd's. Loss
reviews are triggered when a syndicate's losses exceed its capital base or
'stamp capacity'.
There is widespread speculation that the report is taking longer than
expected because several individuals at Lloyd's are being offered the chance
to respond to criticism.
AUA7, the agency that has been appointed to manage the two syndicates,
expects to provide further figures on the extent of the losses early next
month.
