FT  29 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Asset value rises at Scottish Mortgage


   By PHILIP COGGAN


Scottish Mortgage, one of the 'big ten' international investment trusts,
reported an 11.7 per cent increase in net asset value, from 220.3p to
246.1p, over the six months to September 30.
The Baillie Gifford managed trust declared an unchanged interim dividend of
1.35p but the directors said they hoped to declare a final to at least
maintain the real (inflation-adjusted) level of last year's total.
Last year, the company borrowed money to invest in a portfolio of gilts and
Bulldog bonds. To date, it has enjoyed a positive income stream and has made
realised gains of Pounds 7.5m and unrealised gains of Pounds 5m from the
strategy.
First half earnings were up 11.3 per cent to 2.66p (2.39p).
