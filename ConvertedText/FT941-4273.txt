FT  11 MAR 94 / International Company News: Hudson's Bay recovery continues
in final period


   By ROBERT GIBBENS

Hudson's Bay, Canada's biggest department store group, kept up the pace of
recovery in the final quarter of fiscal 1994 with a 3.4 per cent improvement
in revenues to CDollars 1.8bn (USDollars 1.3bn), and net profit up 12 per
cent to CDollars 103.8m, or CDollars 1.90 a share, from CDollars 92.2m, or
CDollars 1.83, a year earlier.
At the operating level, the Bay stores improved profit sharply and the
Zellers discount chain continued to gain strength. Zellers is now the
biggest segment of the Bay's business.
For the full year ended January 31, revenues were up 5.6 per cent to
CDollars 5.4bn and net profit was CDollars 147.7m, or CDollars 2.72 a share,
against CDollars 116.7m, or CDollars 2.32, including a CDollars 8.3m special
gain. The company said that in spite of heavy retail competition, the Bay
was well positioned to continue the better trend in profits.
However, Wal-mart of the US has just entered the Canadian market by buying
120 Woolco discount stores and will become a direct competitor of Zellers.
The Bay declared a quarterly dividend 23 cents a share, up 15 per cent,
payable on April 30 to shareholders of record on April 8.
The dividends will be paid to UK and US shareholders at CDollars 2.037 to
the pound and CDollars 1.357 to the US dollar.
