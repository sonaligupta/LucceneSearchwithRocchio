fall

Societe des Bains de Mer (SBM), the Monte Carlo-based hotel and gaming
group, yesterday warned that its net profits were likely to fall by 20 per
cent to 25 per cent in the current financial year.
SBM, which is the largest company in Monaco and owns the famous Hotel de
Paris as well as the Monte Carlo casino, has been affected by economic
recession and the strength of the French franc against other European
currencies.
The group said it was just starting to detect signs of an improvement in the
economic environment. However, it anticipated a reduction in turnover of
between 9 per cent and 10 per cent in the year to March 31 from FFr1.75bn
(Dollars 297m) in the last full financial year as well as the fall in net
profits from the previous year's FFr135m.
Gaming is expected to register a decline in net profits to FFr200m from
FFr250m. Hotels will suffer a fall in earnings as the occupancy level has
fallen by 8 per cent to 57 per cent in the current year.
