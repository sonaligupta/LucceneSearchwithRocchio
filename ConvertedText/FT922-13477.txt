FT  11 APR 92 / International Company News: VW board approves Piech
appointment


   By ANDREW FISHER


   FRANKFURT


VOLKSWAGEN'S supervisory board yesterday set the seal on the management
succession at the German motor group by confirming the appointment of Mr
Ferdinand Piech to succeed Mr Carl Hahn as chief executive next January.
A committee of the non-executive board had already recommended that Mr
Piech, 54, who runs VW's up-market Audi subsidiary, should take over at the
VW group, with Mr Daniel Goeudevert, 50, the French-born head of the VW
marque, as his deputy.
The appointment was preceded by speculation as to whether the abrasive Mr
Piech, the more conciliatory Mr Goeudevert or an outsider would succeed Mr
Hahn, 65, whose contract had originally been extended to the end of 1993.
It comes at a time of growing internal concern over VW's cost problems
compared with those of other producers in Europe and Japan. The choice of Mr
Piech, an innovative engineer, shows VW's determination to bring costs down.
Even against domestic rivals such as Opel (part of General Motors) and
Ford-Werke (owned by Ford of the US), its costs are high. According to Mr
Stephen Reitman, an analyst with stockbroker UBS Phillips & Drew, 'VW's
internal studies suggest the group has an average 40 per cent assembly cost
disadvantage compared with the Japanese.'
Mr Piech, the grandson of Mr Ferdinand Porsche who designed the VW Beetle
and the first Porsche sports car, said recently 'a murderous struggle' would
rage in the world motor industry.
