FT  25 MAY 93 / S&P says two life insurers are 'vulnerable'


   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent


STANDARD AND POOR'S, the US-based rating agency, has added two more UK life
insurers to its list of companies whose financial strength it has assessed
as 'vulnerable'.
In the second volume of S&P's UK Life Financial Strength Digest, the rating
agency said Life Association of Scotland and General Portfolio Life
Insurance may be highly exposed to adverse economic or underwriting
conditions.
The first volume of financial strength ratings resulted in protests from
life companies and actuaries who questioned S&P's methodology. S&P said its
reports had been prepared 'against a background of unprecedented concern
over the financial strength of UK life offices'.
In the case of General Portfolio, S&P said that despite the company's highly
successful efforts in growing its business, the free asset ratio of its
non-linked business, mostly consisting of guaranteed income bonds, is
relatively low.
Although there has been recent improvement in that indicator of strength,
its ability to sustain that improvement is unclear.
Mr Geoffrey Puritz, joint managing director, said the S&P data were out of
date and that General Portfolio received a Pounds 16m capital injection last
autumn which has improved several of its key ratios.
Also, he said that because General Portfolio has no with-profits business,
there is little point in measuring it using criteria outlined by S&P.
