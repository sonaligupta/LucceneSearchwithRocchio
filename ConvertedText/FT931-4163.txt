FT  12 MAR 93 / Sales rise seen by 46% of retailers


   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent


SHOPS selling chemists' goods, furniture and shoes benefited last month from
more buoyant trading, according to the Confederation of British Industry's
monthly distributive trades survey.
While 46 per cent of retailers polled registered an increase in sales
volumes last month compared with February last year, 27 per cent saw sales
fall.
The 19 per cent balance which experienced increased sales was the highest
since last April. A further pick-up in sales volumes across the sector is
expected this month.
The report, published yesterday, indicates that big stores with more than
500 employees are performing better than smaller shops, possibly because
they have been quicker to drop prices to attract more customers.
Even though the retail sector registered a year-on-year increase in sales
volumes in February for the second month running, the sector still considers
sales to be lower than normal.
The survey polled 474 retailers, wholesalers and motor traders between
February 17 and March 3.
Among different parts of the retail trade, chemists' shops performed
particularly well in February, continuing the trend of strong year-on-year
sales growth during 1992.
The balance of chemists' shops reporting an increase in sales last month -
compared with February last year - was 48 per cent, the same figure as for
stores selling furniture and carpets.
Grocers also saw healthy sales increases last month while off-licences,
specialist food shops and booksellers registered sales declines.
