FT  12 APR 94 / International Company News: Roche sales up 6% in first
quarter


   By IAN RODGER


   ZURICH


Roche, the world's most highly valued pharmaceutical group, said
consolidated sales rose 6 per cent in the first quarter to SFr3.7bn (Dollars
2.6bn).
The relatively low overall increase was due mainly to the rise of the Swiss
franc in recent months against most currencies, especially the US dollar.
Expressed in local currencies, the sales rise was 12 per cent, Roche said.
The group's smaller divisions performed significantly worse than the
dominant pharma division, where sales rose 10 per cent in Swiss franc terms
to SFr2.09bn, or 16 per cent in local currencies.
Roche said its top selling drugs - Rocephin, an anti-infection treatment,
Dormicum, a mild anaesthetic, Roaccutane for treating acne - all showed
sales volume rises.
Roche will publish its profit figures for 1993 next Tuesday.
Sulzer Technology, the Swiss engineering group, has reported an 11 per cent
rise in 1993 net income to SFr186m on a 2 per cent fall in sales to
SFr6.66bn. Operating income was up 7.2 per cent to SFr268m.
The directors are recommending a rise in dividends from SFr16 to SFr18 per
share or participation certificate.
