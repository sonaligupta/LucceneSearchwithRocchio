FT  29 JAN 92 / Turkish gas company privatised

   ANKARA


TURKEY'S new coalition government has concluded its first sizeable
privatisation, selling 51 per cent of a local gas company to Prima Gaz, the
publicly-listed French concern, for TL 350bn (Pounds 35.88m). Prima Gaz now
owns 100 per cent of Ipragas, a bottled gas producer, having already had a
49 per cent stake in the company.
Citibank the US bank advising Prima Gaz said the sale represented a clear
signal of the government's commitment to sell state assets. Mrs Tansu
Ciller,economics minister, says Turkey will press ahead with further sales.
The deal marks France's growing presence in Turkey's gas sector. Technigaz,
a subsidiary of the Bouygues Group, is already building a terminal for
Libyan gas near Istanbul, where SAE - another French concern - is installing
a city gas network. Officials say the French are keen to establish a
position before production from Iran, Qatar and the central Asian republics
comes on stream over the next decade.
