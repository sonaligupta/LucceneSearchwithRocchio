FT  04 AUG 92 / Money Markets: Very bearish mood


DEALERS IN the sterling money market were unwaveringly bearish yesterday, as
cash rates reached their most expensive levels since base rates were cut to
10 per cent.
There were no significant indicators affecting the sterling market
yesterday, but the speculation about a currency devaluation continues to
haunt dealers. Over the weekend, British business leaders continued to press
for the UK government to change its view on sterling's place in the European
Monetary System. The meeting of the Bundesbank council on Thursday is also
anxiously awaited, even though few analysts expect a Lombard rate rise this
time round.
Under these pressures, period rates firmed to new highs. Three-month money
was offered at 10 7/16 per cent, compared to 10 3/8 per cent on Friday
night, while the one-year rate was up to 10 1/2 per cent from 10 7/16 per
cent. Both figures discount a half-point increase in base rates this year.
Trading in sterling futures was similarly bearish. The September short
sterling contract dipped 5 basis points yesterday morning to a low of 89.58,
but recovered to close at 89.66. The September contract has dipped to the
mid-50s since base rates were at 10 per cent, and one commercial bank trader
expected it to be back down there soon.
'The market is unlikely to be in a better mood before the French referendum
on Maastricht in mid-September,' he said, 'and we will easily see those
levels again.'
The Bank of England's operations in the cash market were much easier, now
that the end-of-month difficulties are over. The Bank operated at the
established rates of 9 7/8 per cent for Bands 1 and 2 and 9 15/16 per cent
for the repurchase agreement (repo) repayable on August 24.
In the morning, the Bank purchased Pounds 112m of Band 1 bank bills, Pounds
30m of Band 2 bank bills and Pounds 670m in the repo. Later the Bank bought
Pounds 211m in Band 1. In the afternoon, it purchased Pounds 100m in Band 1.
Late assistance was provided of Pounds 70m.
In Germany, call money rates held firm, with traders reporting scattered
demand in morning trade. They quoted rates of 9.65-9.75 per cent for
overnight money, broadly unchanged from Friday.
