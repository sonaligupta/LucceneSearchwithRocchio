FT  16 JAN 92 / The Lloyd's Report - Analysis: 300 years of change


1688: First mention of Edward Lloyd's Tower Street coffee house. It moved to
Lombard Street in 1691.
1700s: Lloyd's becomes gambling den. Sample bets: survival chances of people
condemned to death.
1769: Scandal leads some underwriters to persuade waiter Thomas Fielding to
set up breakaway Lloyd's in Pope's Head Alley. The new one survives.
1771: Most important document in Lloyd's history signed. Sets up ruling
committee, which still survives, albeit with increased powers and duties.
1781: Lloyd's first constitution, The Trust Deed, written after secretary
John Bennett fails to pass on information that would have allowed
underwriters to avoid losses during Napoleon's Baltic blockade.
1838: Lloyd's home The Royal Exchange burns down. Lloyd's chairman George
Richard Robinson moves business to coffee house.
1871: Lloyd's Act is passed when underwriter AB Forwood makes Pounds 500 on
insider information that a ship, the Venezuelan, is only slightly, not
badly, damaged. Act gives sanctions under criminal law against members.
1874: Henry Hozier sets up signal stations that gave Lloyd's a virtual
monopoly on shipping information. Hozier later resigns over extravagant
expenses, spending more than Pounds 25,000 on luxurious trips around the
world.
1954: Many Names stand to be ruined by underwriter Alec Wilcox who has been
falsely accounting for years. The committee bails them out, establishing an
important precedent that qualifies unlimited liability.
1970: Cromer committee recommends that Lloyd's allows women, foreigners and
the less well-off to become Names.
1973: Sylvia Horsey becomes first woman underwriter.
1975: Body blow to Lloyd's reputation for paying without quibbling comes
when business done by underwriter Tim Sasse leaves Names liable for Dollars
40m - 63 refuse to pay and sue.
1982: Gemini, sea lion star of BBC's Animal Magic, visits Lloyd's and is
filmed at the position where her cover was underwritten.
Loch Ness monster insurance was written for a film company that wanted cover
against a real monster appearing during production.
World's largest cigar, 12 1/2 ft long and retailing at Pounds 17,933.35, was
insured for 50p premium.
Film stars covered by Lloyd's included Betty Grable and her 'million-dollar
legs'.
There are now 22,500 Names of whom 22.5 per cent are women.
