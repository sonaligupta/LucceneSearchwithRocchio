FT  23 APR 93 / Army rifle needed 32 modifications


   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent


THIRTY-TWO different modifications have been required on the Army's standard
rifle, the SA80, since it went into service seven years ago, MPs heard
yesterday.
Major General Anthony Stone, a senior Ministry of Defence procurement
official, said the Pounds 300m rifle manufacture programme had been through
sustained criticism. But he assured the Commons defence committee the Army
was now 'entirely satisfied' with the weapon.
Gremlins included triggers that had to be flicked back into position, firing
pins that broke and magazines that fell off.
Field training before the 1991 Gulf war revealed that bayonets sometimes
became detached.
The safety plunger, a key part of the rifle's blocking mechanism, was found
to move when the rifle was dropped in tests.
The metal plunger was replaced by a plastic one, but the plastic proved too
brittle and attracted water. A new plastic version went into production
three years ago. The Ministry of Defence said a full programme of refitting
existing rifles was 'ongoing'.
Cleaning equipment was also found to be 'less than perfect', but the
ministry did not decide to change it until 1991. New cleaning kits are due
by the end of next year.
Modifications, already carried out on 60 per cent of the 307,000 rifles
delivered, were expected to add 9 per cent to costs. Officials said that the
ministry was still talking to Royal Ordnance, the manufacturer, about
contractual liability.
Maj Gen Stone said design faults had been compounded by production problems
following the sale of Royal Ordnance to British Aerospace in 1987 and
transfer of the small arms manufacture business from Enfield to Nottingham.
