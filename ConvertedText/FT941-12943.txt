FT  27 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Glaxo bounces


   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON


Internationally traded pharmaceuticals group Glaxo bounced in an uncertain
market as US sellers took a back seat, prompting technical buying in London.
The shares closed 13 1/2 stronger at 668p, with turnover heavier than its
average at 7.7m.
Dealers said US investors had been very heavy buyers of puts - a bearish
derivatives trade which allows the investor to sell stock later at a fixed
price and date. Put buying is often carried out as a hedge against possible
bad news, and in this case it was President Clinton's State of the Union
address on Tuesday night which had caused the nervousness.
In the event, most analysts were reassured or at least not flustered by the
president's comments on health care reform. The sellers stayed away and UK
dealers who had maintained short positions for some time bought back stock
to square their books.
However, one international trader said: 'Dollars 20 was a floor on the way
down and will be a resistance on the way up.' The UK closing price equated
to a US price of Dollars 19 3/4 .
Reports of a deal between Cadbury Schweppes and Cott Corporation, of Canada,
in which the UK group will bottle 'own label' drinks in continental Europe
undermined the shares.
Some in the market saw a conflict of interest between the two groups,
arguing that Cadbury could undermine its branded products by producing
cheaper generic versions for Cott. The battle between the two product types
has been a prominent feature in the food industry, particularly over the
past year.
However, Cadbury supporters argued that the move solved the company's spare
capacity problem. Cadbury shares retreated 5 to 526p.
Food retailers were again under pressure as William Low unveiled depressed
margins and cautioned over future trading. The shares dropped 17 to 174p.
Argyll slipped 7 to 274p, Tesco 2 to 230p and Kwik Save 8 to 621p. J.
Sainsbury rallied to close 4 ahead at 447p.
A profits warning from Hogg Group, the insurance broker, saw the company's
shares plunge 22 to a year's low of 130p. There was exceptionally heavy
trading in other broking stocks, however, with much of it transacted at
prices below ruling market levels, according to the Seaq ticker. Sedgwick
settled 3 off at 196p and Willis Corroon 6 lower at 229p on turnovers of
3.6m and 3.2m.
The bid story in the composite insurance sector refused to lie down, with
the market still excited by the prospect that UAP, Europe's second biggest
insurance group, might move against one of the quoted UK companies.
Independent Insurance rose to 314p before closing 3 ahead at 311p. And there
were also persistent stories that UAP may have targeted Royal Insurance's
telephone insurance division, The Insurance Service, the UK market's second
biggest direct insurance group after Royal Bank of Scotland's Direct Line
subsidiary. Dealers noted further underlying support for Royal Insurance, a
net 2 off at 327p.
Sun Life's good new business figures drove Transatlantic shares up 16 to
436p.
Banks took a back seat and reacted to widespread profit-taking. Smith New
Court was seen as a big seller of TSB, which retreated 4 to 280p on 3.2m
traded. Abbey National options were again heavily dealt, the underlying
shares closing 4 up at 506p.
Cray Electronics advanced 6 to 192p after an SG Warburg recommendation.
Warburg said the company's 1994 and 1995 price/earnings relatives offered
prospects for at least 35 to 40 per cent outperformance in the next 18 to 24
months.
The sale of the Brann Direct Marketing subsidiary to a management buy-out
for Pounds 8.15m, plus a buy note from BZW, drove ACT shares up 3 to 179p.
GEC was one of the market's most actively traded stocks, moving up a further
3 1/2 to 340p on turnover of 10m, still boosted by Hoare Govett's buy note.
Credit Lyonnais Laing and BZW were also recommending the stock.
Pearson rose 9 to 664p on recommendations from Lehman Brothers and Henderson
Crosthwaite. Lehman raised its 1994 profits forecast by Pounds 20m to Pounds
270m and targeted a share price of 800p within 12 months.
Public relations group Shandwick improved 8, or 22 per cent, to 43 1/2 p as
SG Warburg recommended the stock up to 55p following figures on Tuesday.
Mirror Group Newspapers receded 4 1/2 to 195 1/2 p, with the market deciding
it was going to lose the battle for control of The Independent, the UK
newspaper. Mr Tony O' Reilly's Irish Independent is tipped by some to emerge
the winner, and United Newspapers, which shares a printing arrangement with
the Irish group, gained 7 at 687p on hopes of extra printing contracts.
Engineering group Bullough forged ahead 14 to 186p after improved figures.
BBA Group fell 9 to 207p after James Capel indicated that it preferred other
stocks in the engineering sector. The broker still has the stock on its hold
list. Volume rose to 5.3m.
British Steel brushed aside a profits downgrading from SG Warburg and closed
a penny firmer at 132 1/2 p. Turnover remained high, reaching 32m shares.
