FT  14 APR 94 / UK Company News: Rolls-Royce and Jaguar progress


   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent


Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, the luxury car subsidiary of Vickers, the UK
engineering group, increased its worldwide retail sales by 9.3 per cent in
the first three months of the year.
Sales of Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars rose from 321 to 351 over the period,
helped by a surge in registrations in the UK.
Jaguar, the UK luxury car subsidiary of Ford of the US, is also enjoying
improving fortunes with a 12 per cent increase in worldwide sales in the
first quarter to 7,073.
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, which managed to break even last year following
drastic restructuring and two years of heavy losses, appears to have halted
the erosion of its sales suffered in 1991 and 1992.
Worldwide retail sales stabilised last year at 1,360, compared with 1,378 in
1992. Sales reached a record 3,333 in 1990.
The higher sales in the first quarter this year were due chiefly to a 68 per
cent rise in registrations in the UK from 85 to 143.
Jaguar's sales were also boosted by rising demand in the UK but unlike
Rolls-Royce, it is sharing in the strong growth of car sales in the US, its
single largest market worldwide. Registrations in the UK rose by 25 per cent
in the first three months to 2,029, while sales in the US increased by 18
per cent to 3,016.
