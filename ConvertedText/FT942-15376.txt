FT  15 APR 94 / Observer: Not bossed about


Bewilderment in the wake of Lancer Boss's decline into receivership is
nowhere greater than at the company's Spanish subsidiary, Boss Espana.
Employees at the factory in Barcelona complain they have been left not only
in the dark but also without a boss. Their two senior managers, both
British, have not been seen since the receivership decision on Friday.
For want of any further instructions, the company's 180-strong workforce is
dutifully carrying on producing trucks - while trying to talk to Grant
Thornton. The receivers however maintain that the Spanish operation is not
itself in administration, and that the UK company would like to establish a
commercial relationship with Boss Espana as a separate entity. Only problem
is, with Barcelona Boss remaining bossless, who does Leighton Buzzard Boss
deal with? Even the receiver had to admit that it was a 'complex' situation.
