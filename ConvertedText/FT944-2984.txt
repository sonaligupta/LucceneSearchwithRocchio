FT  15 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Answer lies in question


   From Mr MARK GRIFFITH


Sir, Lord Plumb is right (Letters, December 8) when, commenting on a survey
of the attitudes to the European Union in the UK and Germany, he says that
how questions are framed in polls on the EU can affect the result. However,
this usually works for, not against, the EU lobby.
Several countries would not be in the association if referendum questions
had been worded with Yes for staying out and No for going in. Pro-Union
politicians are quick enough to use what he calls 'popular bewilderment'
when it suits them.
Confused voters choosing the friendly, positive-sounding Yes are called bold
and intelligent when they vote for the in-stitution that gives Lord Plumb
purpose, the European Union.
