FT  30 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Drugs pressured


   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY


Bears in the drugs sector were to the fore with more uncertainity moving
through the sector mostly on the back of caution over Wellcome. The stock
continued the slide it began after its disappointing results on Thursday and
lost a further 22 yesterday to 690p with 9.3m shares traded. A number of
brokers distanced themselves from the stock, declaring it either overvalued
or recommending a sell. Several thought that 650p could prove a settling
price for the stock.
Most bears stopped short of saying that the sector could face a re-rating
after Wellcome's aftermath soured sentiment for other stocks. But one said:
'This will certainly add to the nervousness in the sector.'
One stabilising force for pharmaceuticals was that fears over the Clinton
healthcare plan appear to be receding. One analyst said: 'The feeling in
Washington is that only parts of it will be implemented.'
Kleinwort Benson was offering to buy Invergordon shares at 298 1/4 p for a
48-hour cash settlement, which was the signal for a huge rush of investors
seeking a quick return on their holdings. While one leading institution was
said to have sold its entire 7.75m shares, directors were also said to be
active, one selling 675,000 options at 4p for a net return of over Pounds
2m. Total turnover reached 55m. Kleinwort is acting for Whyte & Mackay which
has made a 300p-a-share offer, reluctantly accepted by the Invergordon board
on Thursday.
Food retailers stayed under pressure as the predicted price war broke out,
with Asda beating the expected combatants to the gun as it announced a price
freeze on 5,000 items. The other supermarkets groups are expected to respond
in kind, with one analyst commenting: 'It's going to be a bloody Christmas.'
Asda shares slipped 1 1/2 to 54p in another day's big turnover of 25m. Tesco
dropped 3 1/2 to 203p in volume of 6.3m, J Sainsbury 6 1/2 to 395 1/2 p in
turnover of 4.8m and Kwik Save 9 to 642p.
Broker upgrades followed the trading statement and analysts meeting with
Rank Organisation. The Rank share price, which has been under some pressure
recently, reacted favourably and closed 9 ahead at 841p in busy turnover of
2.5m. Such was the recent caution surrounding the stock that many brokers
were preparing to reduce their profit estimates ahead of yesterday's
meeting, worried over the group's debts and Xerox contribution. However,
some improvement had been seen in the group's overall trading and the market
forecast for this year shifted from Pounds 240-260m to Pounds 250-265m.
The revelations of write-downs on the hotel valuations at Queens Moat
Houses, which was suspended earlier this year with financial problems, had a
surprisingly mild effect on the hotel sector. Forte actually shot forward in
early trading as Rank announced a good price for the sale of one of its
central London hotels. The shares later slipped back to close a half-penny
off at 221 1/2 p.
Several factors put a bit of vim into the oil sector, despite the weakness
of the crude price. Shell enjoyed investor interest after its oil figures
were well received and moved ahead 9 to 711p in turnover of 4.9m.
A successful auction of shares in its scrip dividend helped to push up the
price of Enterprise Oil 4 to 484p. BP continued to attract keen support
ahead of Thursday's third quarter figures, the shares closing 4 up at 349
1/2 p.
Brisk two-way business was reported in Cable and Wireless as the shares
underwent a split. Opening at 486p, they went to 498p and edged up in a
perky telecoms sector to close 3 up at 501p. Turnover was 10m. The move was
put down to the hectic activity in the Far East market, still buzzing with
the huge flotation of Singapore Telecom. Vodafone gained 8 to 553p. Dealers
said that the forthcoming flotation of Pac-Tel's cellular arm was exciting
interest in the UK group's valuation.
There was another day's huge turnover in Ferranti, the electronics and
aerospace group undergoing an agreed 1p-a-share bid from GEC. Over 63m
shares traded hands as they edged down a quarter to 1 1/2 p. GEC gained 2 to
352p, partly from relief over the Jubilee line extention.
There were no real features in the insurance areas of the market, with only
Sun Alliance, having any exposure to the massive storm damage afflicting
northern California. Sun Alliance shares eased 2 to 369p.
