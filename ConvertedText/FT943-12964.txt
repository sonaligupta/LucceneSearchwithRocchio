FT  22 JUL 94 / Japanese sentenced for bribe


   By REUTER


   TOKYO


A Japanese court gave two former officials of a construction company
suspended prison terms yesterday for bribing a regional governor to win a
contract, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
The Tokyo district court verdict was the first conviction of executives in a
string of construction scandals. More than a dozen officials from various
companies and several local government leaders have been arrested on
suspicion of corruption since last year.
The Tobishima executives were found guilty of handing Y10m (Pounds 65,300)
to Mr Fujio Takeuchi, then governor of Ibaraki Prefecture, at a Tokyo
restaurant on January 25, 1991.
