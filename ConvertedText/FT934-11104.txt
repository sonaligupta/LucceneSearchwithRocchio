FT  02 NOV 93 / International Company News: Asea Brown Boveri sets up US
investment fund

   NEW YORK


ASEA BROWN Boveri, the European manufacturer of power plant and industrial
systems, announced yesterday that it is setting up a fund with six US
investment institutions to provide equity and subordinated debt to help
finance major industrial and power projects in America.
GE Capital, the financial services arm of power equipment manufacturer
General Electric, already provides equity capital for power projects, but
ABB believes its move will give it a lead in other industrial areas served
by the company, such as petrochemicals and paper and pulp.
Mr Arun Nayar, head of ABB project and trade finance in the US, said that it
meant the group could stay 'in house' to fund the equity element of a
project, as well as the debt portion.
The partners in the investment vehicle, which has several hundred million
dollars of capital, include US West Financial, Heller Financial, and
Ridgewood Energy of New Jersey.
