FT  01 DEC 94 / Observer: Cap'n Bert


The European, the weekly newspaper founded by the late Robert Maxwell, is on
a bit of a roll these days. It is much livelier than it was in Maxwell's
day, which may reflect the fact that its new owners - the secretive Barclay
Brothers - do not seem interested in interfering in its day-to-day running.
Now the paper has recruited Bert Hardy, probably the most astute manager on
Fleet Street, as its chief executive. Bert, who retires as managing director
of Associated Newspapers at the end of the year, is knocking on a bit. But
after 52 years in Fleet Street, he should have as good a feel as anybody
whether The European has a future as a proper newspaper. His arrival
suggests that it can no longer be dismissed as just another rich man's
plaything.
