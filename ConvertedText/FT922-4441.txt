FT  05 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Midland in demand again


   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and COLIN MILLHAM


BUYERS returned to Midland Bank ahead of an eagerly expected statement today
from Lloyds Bank, the counterbidder for control of Midland. Enthusiasm also
sprang from the sale of Midland's travel agency business and approval in the
US for the Hongkong & Shanghai Banking (HSBC) bid. Despite the lower than
normal client business, caused by a blackout of the electronic trading
system, there were 18m shares dealt and the stock closed 10 up at 467p.
More than a third of the turnover was said to have reflected large agency
crosses by broker James Capel, which has been buying on behalf of HSBC.
Other investors were trading in the hope that Lloyds will today increase its
bid to well above 500p a share. Also, HSBC announced that the US Federal
Reserve Bank had given clearance for the proposed merger and finally Midland
said it has agreed the sale of the historic Thomas Cook travel agency to LTU
Group and Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale of Germany for more than
Pounds 200m. The sale had been expected but analysts said it was good for
sentiment.
Dowty deals
The battle for control of aerospace and information technology company Dowty
Group moved up a gear yesterday when SG Warburg, acting for predator TI
Group, went into the market to acquire up to 10 per cent of Dowty, the limit
allowed under UK takeover rules in the Pounds 525.7m bid.
Warburg was reported to have offered 189p a share for stock and the turnover
of 50m shares by the close of business indicated that the broker had
purchased the 24m shares for which it had gone shopping. The broker is
believed to have acquired the number of shares it wanted by lunchtime and
one institution was said to have sold half its holding in Dowty yesterday.
Shares in Dowty improved 6 up at 182p, while TI added 7 to 364p.
Dowty is to report full-year figures today and the company has indicated
profits for the year to March 1992 to be Pounds 32m, against Pounds 20m the
previous year. There were suggestions in the market yesterday that
current-year profits could exceed Pounds 50m.
Boots suffers
Reduced profit forecasts led to a fall in Boots, which lost 23 to 467p
yesterday. This followed disappointment at the company's results and
speculation that it intends to spend Pounds 15m to Pounds 20m on marketing
its Manoplax heart drug.
County NatWest cut its estimate for the 1992-93 by Pounds 4m to Pounds 402m,
while Nomura reduced to Pounds 395m from Pounds 415m, and the average figure
seemed to have dropped to around Pounds 400m.
Analysts also expressed concern about increased costs at Boots the Chemists
retailing chain and said margins had not improved as much as expected. They
added that, in the longer term, the main worry about the company was whether
Manoplax and Boots retailing interests, other than pharmacies, would be able
to carry the group forward.
Others said the profit figure of Pounds 359.5m, after stripping out property
gains, was below expectations, and although the company had not done badly
there was general weakness in several divisions, including pharmaceuticals
which had a depressed second half.
Fisons failed to gain from a statement by Boots that it will take a look at
the company's healthcare business, which Fisons wants to sell. Fisons shares
were steady at 362p.
Kingfisher, the Woolworth and B&Q holding company remained out of favour,
falling 10 to 535p, partly in sympathy with Boots and also in reaction to a
gloomy statement at this week's annual meeting.
A higher oil price, predictions that the cost of Brent crude would continue
to rise and a more positive attitude from US investment houses helped the
oil majors.
Brent crude was firmly above Dollars 21.50 yesterday and technical analysts
claimed that July oil futures on the International Petroleum Exchange in
London were set to exceed Dollars 22 a barrel.
BP was up 3 at 271p with 11m shares traded. Salomon Brothers was said to be
recommending the stock and Lehman Brothers raised its earnings per share
forecast for 1992 by 2.7p to 15.8p and its 1993 figure by 4.6p to 16.5p.
Lehman increased its forecast to reflect a raised projection for the average
price of Brent crude; the house is now looking at Dollars 20.25 for this
year and Dollars 21 for next year. Lehman analyst Mr Jeremy Hudson still had
reservations about BP's fundamentals but believed the dividend was now
secure. He takes a more positive line on Shell Transport which, he says,
will be pulled up by the strength in Royal Dutch and still has a 10 per cent
upside in the price. Shell picked up 5 to 512p.
An announcement that Standard Chartered is to receive Dollars 62m (Pounds
34.4m) from an out of court settlement in respect of a litigation claim
failed to boost the shares. Standard is still overshadowed by its exposure
to problems in the Bombay stock market and the shares merely held at 480p.
Among utilities Anglian Water gained 8 to 437p, as analysts decided it had
changed its image for relatively low dividends, after being the first water
company to provide dividend growth of over 10 per cent in this year's
reporting season. Anglian reported profits of Pounds 171.3m for the year to
March 31, compared with Pounds 152.5m, a rise of 12.3 per cent, and a climb
in the full year dividend to 19.3p from 17.5p.
Property companies remained under a cloud, with MEPC slipping 15 to 315p.
Builders merchant Norcros gained 17 to 148p as the company reported slightly
higher profits of Pounds 15.6m, against Pounds 15.0m last year. Norcros said
the second half showed particular improvement, benefitting from
restructuring, and it was optimistic about increased economic confidence.
Tobacco shares weakened on fears about an anti-smoking ruling by the US
Supreme Court. Rothmans 'B' fell 18 to 1070p and BAT Industries gave up 15
to 795p.
Regional brewer Marston Thompson and Evershed rose 3 to 257p on news that
the company had signed a reciprocal distribution agreement with Courage, the
UK brewing arm of Fosters. This followed a similar deal announced between
Marston's and Bass on Wednesday.
Realisation that it had been ignored recently helped Courtaulds. The
chemicals group rebounded 13 to 565p after the chemicals team at Smith New
Court pointed out at the morning conference that the shares were down by
around 8 per cent over the past month.
The winning of a supply contract from Qatar boosted Vosper Thornycroft which
improved 5 to 300p.
Lucas Industries retreated 6 to 137p, after James Capel weighed in with a
profits downgrading.
