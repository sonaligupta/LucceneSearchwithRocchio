FT  04 MAR 94 / International Company News: Bank unit boosts Keppel result


   By KIERAN COOKE


   KUALA LUMPUR


Keppel, one of Singapore's biggest conglomerates, has reported pre-tax
profits for the year ended December 31 of SDollars 338.5m (USDollars 214m),
a 21 per cent rise on the previous year. The increase was achieved despite a
2 per cent drop in turnover to SDollars 1.53bn.
Keppel, majority-controlled by the Singapore government and one of the
island republic's leading ship repair and shipbuilding companies, said
growth and profitability had improved significantly in the second half.
While pre-tax profits in Keppel's shipbuilding and repair sector were down
slightly in 1993, the group's figures were boosted by big gains at Keppel
Bank, the recently partially privatised banking and financial services arm
of the group. The unit's pre-tax profits rose to SDollars 122m in 1993 from
SDollars 57.5m.
The group said it expected higher operating profits in the coming year due
to the improvement in the US economy and continued high regional economic
growth.
A final dividend of 12 cents per share was recommended.
Sembawang, another of Singapore's state-controlled conglomerates based on
ship repair, has announced pre-tax profits for 1993 of SDollars 124.1m, a 6
per cent decline on 1992. Revenues also fell 6 per cent to SDollars 666m.
