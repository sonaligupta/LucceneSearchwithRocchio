FT  26 OCT 92 / Observer: Bread winner


Who says British manufacturing industry is on its last legs? A Corby company
has just launched a cunning piece of world-beating technology to ensure that
sandwiches are accurately cut into neat diamond shapes time and time again.
Whatever their filling, the Pounds 12,500 machine shepherds them along at
rates up to 3,600 a minute, and aligns them at the precise angle to allow
them to be cut from corner to corner.
As a result, Rutland Handling & Packaging Systems expects to make a meal out
of the UK sandwich market which is estimated to be worth Pounds 1.7bn a
year.
For one thing, the development reduces wastage caused by 'poor sandwich
alignment' - which at as much as 2 per cent of the materials involved, can
eat volume producers' profits away. For another, it should go down well with
big retailers such as Tesco and Marks & Spencer which spurn sarnies of
improper cut.
The company also hopes to add more than a crust to Britain's balance of
payments by exporting its machines. So far enquiries have rolled in from
Sweden, Germany, New Zealand and Saudi Arabia to name but a few.
