FT  27 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Gold


With tensions mounting over Iraq, Friday might have seemed an odd day for
the gold price to go into reverse after its recent run. But finding a
plausible rationalisation for gyrations in the price of the barbaric metal
is increasingly difficult.
The mini-boom since early summer was supposed, in part, to have been
inspired by the weakness of the dollar and a consequent increase in gold's
safe haven attractions. Yet the safe haven theory derived little support
from gold's muted euphoria during the Gulf crisis. Nor should it have, given
the success of the financial services industry in devising less cumbersome
hedges against uncertainty.
Recently, gold is said to have derived strength from the weakness of global
equities. Yet sagging equity prices reflect worries about debt deflation.
The opportunity cost of holding a non-income producing asset in a period of
high real interest rates is high; and where, as in Britain, inflation is
falling faster than interest rates, the opportunity cost becomes higher by
the day.
If there is a case for real assets in the current climate, it is easier to
make for income-producing real estate. In the bombed-out UK property market,
the average yield on all properties at 9.3 per cent shows a positive
half-point margin over long gilts.
The snag in looking at property as a fixed-income investment lies in the
residual value attaching to land at the end of the 25-year institutional
lease. In the absence of land price inflation, the comparison with gilts may
prove optimistic.
