Bombardier, the big Canadian transit equipment and aerospace group, and
Power Corporation of Canada, a diversified management group, have formed a
joint venture with China National Railway Locomotive (LORIC) to build rail
carriages in China. The operation will be based at Loric's factory near
Qingdao, Shandong Province. It will use Bombardier technology and later will
be expanded to build subway cars, light rail and commuter vehicles and
inter-city equipment for Chinese and export markets.
