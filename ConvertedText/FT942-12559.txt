FT  29 APR 94 / UK terror claim underlines prickly relations: Roger Matthews
reports on some of the contradictions of Iranian foreign policy


   By ROGER MATTHEWS


Britain's accusation yesterday that Iranian intelligence agents had been in
contact with the IRA will lengthen the already long shadow hanging over
relations between the two countries. It also serves to underline the
complexity of maintaining links with Iran, which often appears to be
pursuing contradictory foreign policy aims.
Officially, Iran wishes to improve its contacts with Britain and with most
other industrialised nations. Mr Gholamreza Ansari, the senior Iranian
diplomat in London, said after being summoned to the Foreign Office
yesterday the meeting had been very friendly. 'I was informed about their
concern', he said. 'I am sure it is not right, but I will be in contact with
my country - definitely it is not right.' Mr Ansari is often seen at
diplomatic receptions in London, smiling, affable, and presenting the face
of Iran which is in line with official policy.
But a visit to Tehran serves as a reminder that Iranian policy also remains
committed to the export of the revolution and to offering assistance to
'oppressed Moslems' throughout the world. Officials deny there is anything
sinister in this ambition. Words are our bullets, they say, stressing that
many Moslems look to them for guidance. How those people choose to pursue
their own domestic political struggles is a matter for them to decide.
Similarly, they say, Iran cannot stand by when Islam is blasphemed, as was
claimed the case with British author Salman Rushdie. Mr Javad Larijani,
foreign policy adviser to President Ali Hashemi Rafsanjani, said in an
interview last year that to withdraw the fatwa condemning Mr Rushdie to
death would be like disowning Islam and the Koran.
'The withdrawal of the fatwa is not the sort of condition which British
politicians should put on relations with Iran. It is quite unreasonable',
said Mr Larijani. Britain has been equally adamant that full diplomatic
relations could not be restored with Iran unless the fatwa was lifted.
British officials add privately that at the very least they need assurances
from Iran that no attempt will be made to carry out the fatwa, which was
issued originally by the late Ayatollah Khomeini in February 1989. But in
the absence of a single central authority in Tehran such an assurance would
lack credibility, especially as the Iranian regime continues to pursue
policies in the Middle East which are fundamentally opposed to British and
other western interests.
Iran, for example, is totally against the peace process under way between
Israel, its Arab neighbours and the Palestine Liberation Organisation, is
the main supporter of Hizbollah, the radical Shia faction in Lebanon, and
would welcome an Islamic government in Algeria. Officials in Tehran find
nothing contradictory in pursuing such policies while also seeking to
establish a better working relationship with Britain. For them it is a
matter of the British coming to terms with the reality of the Islamic
republic.
However, the accusation of links with the IRA can but lend support to US
assertions that Iran should be shunned by the international community
because of its links with terrorist organisations and alleged attempts to
secure a nuclear weapons capacity. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of
state, was quick yesterday to express his anger at 'the continued terrorism
projected by Iran' and to urge other countries against offering any economic
assistance to Tehran.
Guilty or not, Tehran is sure to seek popular support by presenting the
British charges as evidence of further western attempts to undermine the
Islamic government, and probably as an attempt to distract international
attention from what is happening to the Moslem community in Bosnia. It is an
interpretation which will be comfortably accepted by many Iranians,
including those who did not support the revolution. Such people, steeped in
conspiracy theories, continue to believe that the UK helped to topple the
Shah in 1979, and claim that if anyone lifted up Ayatollah Khomeini's beard
they would find stamped the words 'Made in Britain'.
