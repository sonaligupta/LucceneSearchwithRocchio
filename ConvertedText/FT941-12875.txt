FT  28 JAN 94 / House prices start to edge up

Indications emerged yesterday that the worst might be over for Japan's
domestic property market, according to the Government Housing Loan
Corporation of Japan.
The average price of a newly built home rose in October for the first time
in two years, standing at at Y43.96m (Pounds 264,000), a 3.8 per cent
increase on the corporation's previous survey last April.
However, the corporation noted the recovery was confined to provincial
Japan. Average prices in the central region around Tokyo fell during the
six-month period by 0.4 per cent, to Y53.1m.
Sales of new condominiums in Japan's largest cities rose by 39.2 per cent in
1993, the first rise in three years, said a separate study by the Real
Estate Economy Institute. It predicted another big rise, from last year's
104,621 units, to at least 130,000 condominiums in the current year, helped
by continued low prices and falling interest rates on home loans.
Consumer spending remains weak, however, according to the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry's latest count of sales by department
stores and supermarkets. The turnover of large stores fell by 4.9 per cent
to Y21,490bn last year, after recording the 19th consecutive month of
decline in December.
Miti said growth in sales of all commodities had slipped below 1992 levels.
Clothing sales have been down particularly because of slack demand for
business suits and high-fashion apparel. The statistics cover 424 department
stores and 2,062 supermarkets.
The economic slump has made consumers more sensitive to prices, the ministry
said. With corporate profits down, large-scale demand has fallen
significantly, it added.
