FT  02 JUL 92 / Local authorities turn to worms


   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor


NORMALLY the sight of hundreds of worms writhing around in the kitchen
rubbish bin might prompt a horrified call to the local council's pest
control officer. But if you live in the outer London borough of Sutton, the
chances are that the worms came from the council.
Sutton is distributing 1,000 'wormeries' - special plastic bins for waste
food and organic refuse - to families that volunteer for an experiment to
reduce the amount of kitchen waste collected every week by the borough's
binmen.
Each household receives a starter tub of 200 tiger worms to populate the
wormery. They look like thin earthworms, typically 2 to 4 in long, with pale
stripes. A single wormery will convert all the food waste of an average
family - more than half a tonne a year - into a mixture of high-quality
solid compost and liquid plant food.
The wormery is suitable for the kitchen because it does not stink of
rubbish, says Mr Chris Myers of Sutton Council. 'If anything, there is a
faintly sweet smell. And the worms can't overrun your kitchen. They soon
reach a stable population of a few hundred.'
Sutton council and the district of Adur in West Sussex, which is running a
similar experiment, say the worms are part of a wide initiative to cut
domestic waste - and therefore eventually save chargepayers money through
reduced collection and landfill costs.
