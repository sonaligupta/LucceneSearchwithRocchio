FT  29 JAN 92 / Azerbaijan helicopter shot down


ARMENIAN militants yesterday shot down an Azerbaijani civilian helicopter
flying over the strife-torn Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, killing
about 40 people, an Azerbaijani presidential spokesman said, agencies
report.
It was the most serious incident in the fight for control of the area since
a civilian helicopter carrying officials trying to mediate in the conflict
was shot down two months ago, killing more than 20 people.
The reports seemed certain to inflame tensions between the former Soviet
republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan. Fighting over Nagorno-Karabakh
intensified late last year after the Russian president, Mr Boris Yeltsin,
ordered the withdrawal of troops sent to the region to keep the peace.
Tass and Interfax news agencies said the helicopter was hit while on a
flight from the town of Agdam to Shusha, an Azeri stronghold in
Nagorno-Karabakh.
'According to preliminary data, the helicopter was carrying around 40
people, including women and children. All passengers and crew members died,'
Tass quoted an Azeri official as saying.
The Armenian mission in Moscow confirmed the shooting down of the helicopter
but said it was 'presumably carrying weapons and ammunition to Azerbaijanis
who have been attacking the Armenian village of Karintag' (between
Stepanakert and Shusha).
Azerbaijan has abolished the autonomous status of Nagorno-Karabakh and
introduced presidential rule in parts of the region, actions dismissed by
Armenia as meaningless.
