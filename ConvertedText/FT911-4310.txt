FT  19 APR 91 / BP may issue Britoil shares to cut tax bill


   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES


BRITISH PETROLEUM is working on a novel plan to issue shares in its Britoil
subsidiary to BP shareholders in an attempt to reduce its advance
corporation tax bill.
The company said yesterday the proposal would mean shareholders could elect
to receive their dividend on Britoil's shares rather than BP shares. This
would save BP about Pounds 150m in the first year of the scheme.
The shares are likely to be redeemable preference shares with a low nominal
value. They will be attached to BP shares and shareholders will not be able
to trade them separately.
Mr Bob Horton, BP chairman, said: 'BP has over the years built up an excess
of ACT which it is required to pay to the Exchequer whenever it pays
dividends to shareholders. Although its liability is reduced by these
payments, it may be some time before the excess can be fully utilised. By
contrast, Britoil could utilise ACT immediately.'
Mr Horton said there was still some way to go before the plan can be
finalised but he will meeting the authorities soon to discuss it.
There will be no cash incentive for shareholders to take their dividend
payments on Britoil shares beyond the benefit that will accrue to BP.
Mr Horton told shareholders at the annual meeting that the group expected
current production of 1.5m barrels a day of oil equivalent to continue into
the next century.
