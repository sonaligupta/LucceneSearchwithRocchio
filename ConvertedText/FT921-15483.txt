FT  10 JAN 92 / Cheney fears nuclear technology will spread


   By DAVID WHITE and FRANCES WILLIAMS


   LONDON, GENEVA


MR RICHARD CHENEY, US defence secretary, warned yesterday that it might be
impossible to prevent new nuclear-armed states emerging as a result of the
break-up of the Soviet Union. Speaking before talks with Mr Tom King, his UK
counterpart, Mr Cheney said that former Soviet nuclear scientists might help
other countries develop weapons.
The US and its allies had to take account of this in planning for military
contingencies. Developing defences against ballistic missiles was 'more
important than ever'. Mr Cheney is due inGermany today.
Russia, meanwhile, sought to reassure the west about the danger of chemical
weapons proliferation, for some in Nato an even greater concern.
Mr Sergei Batsanov, Russian ambassador to the UN Disarmament Conference in
Geneva, said the former Soviet Union's chemical weapon stocks and production
facilities had for some time been located exclusively on Russian territory.
Russia had sole responsibility for their control and eventual destruction,
he said. But it currently had no facility for destroying them. Destruction
was supposed to start this year under the terms of a 1990 US-Soviet accord
But both sides acknowledge this is now impossible and that the accord will
need renegotiation.
