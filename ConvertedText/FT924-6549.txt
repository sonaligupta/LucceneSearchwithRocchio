ANGLO AMERICAN Corporation, South Africa's largest mining house, has
announced that it is proceeding with the R1bn Namakwa Sands heavy minerals
project in the North-Western Cape.
Speaking in Johannesburg yesterday, Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, chairman,
said the project showed that 'although South Africa is a small player in
global terms, we are as competent, innovative and competitive as the rest'.
Production is scheduled to start in 1994 at an initial mining rate of 4m
tonnes a year, rising to full capacity of 16m tonnes as the market improves.
Reserves are in excess of 500m tonnes. At full production the plant should
generate revenue of R360m (Pounds 48m) a year, in 1992 money, almost all of
which will come from exports.
The capital cost is R946m in current money. The R576m equity portion will be
funded 80 per cent by Anglo and 20 per cent by its associate De Beers. The
Industrial Development Corporation will be lending the balance of R370m.
The main product at Namakwa Sands will be Ilmenite, which will be smelted to
produce titanium slag and pig iron. The slag is ultimately used as a
colourant in paper and paints, while pig iron is a speciality iron with
ductile qualities. By-products will be zircon, used in the ceramics and
foundry industries, and rutile, which is used in the manufacture of pigment
for the paint, paper and plastics industries. At full production the project
will produce annuallly 195,000 tonnes of slag, 120,000 tonnes of pig iron,
140,000 of zircon and 38,000 tonnes of rutile.
