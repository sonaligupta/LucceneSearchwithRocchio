FT  27 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Bain Clarkson venture in Vietnam


   By RICHARD LAPPER


Bain Clarkson, the international insurance broker which is part of Inchcape,
yesterday announced a new joint venture in Vietnam, becoming the first
insurance broker to be licensed in the country.
The deal follows hard on the heels of the announcement earlier this month of
the liberalisation of the local market, hitherto dominated by Baoviet, the
state-owned insurance company.
Bain Clarkson, which already operates in 11 other countries in east Asia, is
setting up a 50:50 joint venture between its Inchcape Insurance Holdings
(Hong Kong) subsidiary and Baoviet. Each partner will invest Dollars 125,000
(Pounds 83,000) in the new company, Inchinbrok, which will operate initially
from Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.
Inchinbrok will provide the first retail insurance broking service in
Vietnam, focusing on arranging commercial insurance and financial services
for multinationals investing in the country.
It will place business both with Baoviet and other insurance companies. It
is understood that four Japanese companies - Yasuda Fire and Marine, Dowa
Fire and Marine, Tokio Marine and Fire and Mitsui Marine and Fire - have
been given permission to open representative offices, with Yasuda opening
its office at the end of last month.
'As the first fully licensed insurance broker we will introduce competition
among insurers which will benefit client companies and expand the market as
more operations elect to insure,' said Mr Simon Arnold, chairman.
