FT  12 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: London gets the jitters


FT-SE Index: 2,522.4 (-52.4)
The uneasy lull in the UK stock market of late was spectacularly interrupted
yesterday by the biggest one-day fall in the FT-SE this year. Dashed hopes
of an interest rate cut had something to do with it and, given the City's
still widespread assumption of an outright Conservative victory next month,
so did Mr Lamont's failure to deliver a knock-out punch in the Budget.
For the next four weeks fundamental analysis will take second place to
opinion polls. In this context it is worth recalling that while the market
performed well during the last three election campaigns, it dived 9 per cent
in September-October 1974 when the Tories also began the formal political
fighting 3 points behind. Bad news is likely to be exacerbated this time by
traders' emotional response to the prospect of a 59 per cent effective tax
rate and by the fact that many veterans of today's markets were in short
trousers when a Socialist was last spied in Downing Street.
