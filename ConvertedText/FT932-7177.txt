FT  25 MAY 93 / International Company News: Injection of FM700m for Skopbank


   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES


   STOCKHOLM


FINLAND'S government guarantee fund has agreed to inject a further FM700m
(Dollars 128m) into Skopbank, one of the country's leading banks, to ensure
it continues to meet international capital adequacy requirements.
The infusion, which will be used to subscribe to the bank's capital
certificates, means the bank has now received FM3.7bn in support from the
government guarantee fund and a further FM600m in state preference capital
to help it over Finland's banking crisis.
A further FM13.8bn was invested in a rescue of Skopbank by the Bank of
Finland in September 1991 prior to its transfer to the state's guarantee
fund in June 1992.
Last year, the bank sustained a FM3.61bn loss and its capital adequacy ratio
slumped to 8.2 per cent at the year-end, just over the 8 per cent
international minimum. Skopbank had already indicated it might need FM1.5bn
of extra support this year.
The government has yet to decide on the future of Skopbank, the central bank
for Finland's savings banks, and the Savings Bank of Finland, which is also
in state ownership.
Merrill Lynch is currently studying reorganisation options for both banks,
including a merger of the two. Earlier discussions which might have led to
them being taken over by Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, the country's leading
commercial bank, have been adjourned, pending the presentation of the
Merrill Lynch report.
The government guarantee fund owns 63 per cent of the votes in Skopbank and
53 per cent of the shares.
