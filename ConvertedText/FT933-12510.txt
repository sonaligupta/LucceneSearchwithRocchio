FT  23 JUL 93 / UK Company News: MCC administrators sellMolecular Design for
Dollars 90m


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


PRICE Waterhouse, administrators of Maxwell Communication Corporation, has
sold Molecular Design, a California-based software company, for Dollars 90m
(Pounds 60m).
The deal is the first sizeable disposal of the US businesses owned by MCC.
MDL, which provides specialist software and support for the chemical and
pharmaceutical industries, was sold through a public offering and flotation.
Mr Alan Jamieson, the Price Waterhouse administrator, said there were bids
for MDL but because of the intangibles involved - intellectual property and
goodwill - the flotation raised more money.
All the MCC businesses in the US are in the process of being sold. Four
companies are in the final round of detailed due diligence and bidding for
Macmillan, the US publishing business which includes a 50 per cent interest
in the Macmillan/McGraw-Hill School Publishing Company joint venture.
Reed Elsevier is still favourite to buy Official Airlines Guide. The
Anglo-Dutch group has a non-binding, non-exclusive letter of intent. No
other higher offer has so far been received and Reed has obtained US
anti-trust clearance to acquire the business. The Collier Encyclopedia
publishing business is also being sold separately.
At the beginning of the disposal programme it was thought between Dollars
680m and Dollars 1.1bn would be raised.
