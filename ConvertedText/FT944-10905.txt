FT  08 NOV 94 / BHP currency sham alleged

Mr Brian Loton, chairman of Broken Hill Proprietary, and other directors of
the large Australian resources group, were yesterday alleged to have had
some knowledge of sham foreign exchange transactions in the late 1980s
involving Elders IXL, the brewing and agriproducts company now known as
Foster's Brewing Group. The allegation was contained in a statement tendered
to the Melbourne Magistrates Court by Mr Ken Jarrett, a former Elders
executive, during a long-running committal hearing which has followed the
filing of conspiracy and theft charges against Mr John Elliott, former
Elders chief, and other one-time Elders executives. Mr Jarrett agreed to
give evidence against his former boss earlier this year. He has already
received a six-month jail sentence after agreeing to co-operate.
