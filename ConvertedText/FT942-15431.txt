FT  15 APR 94 / PIA starts vetting prospective members


   By ALISON SMITH


The new watchdog to protect private investors will begin its vetting of
prospective members a week today, with the first meeting of the Personal
Investment Authority membership committee.
The committee, headed by Ms Helena Wiesner, a public-interest member of the
PIA board, will meet once or twice a week in an intensive programme of
processing membership applications.
The membership committee will have 30 members and groups from it will go
through the applications in detail. As the process continues, the PIA will
assess the proportion of potential members that are rejected.
