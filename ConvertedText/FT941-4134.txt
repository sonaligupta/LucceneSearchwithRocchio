FT  12 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Sainsbury to axe 650 jobs


J Sainsbury, the UK's biggest grocery retailer, is cutting about 650 jobs in
its head and area offices over the next eight months as part of a
restructuring of its business.
The company had warned in January - when it announced a fall in gross profit
margins and underlying sales - that job losses could not be ruled out as a
result of a business review carried out in conjunction with external
consultants.
Yesterday's announcement follows a similar move by Tesco, the UK's
second-biggest supermarket group, which said last month it was cutting 800
full-time jobs.
Sainsbury said the aim was to 'concentrate effort on providing outstanding
service throughout all parts of the business and to simplify and rationalise
operations and eliminate overlaps'.
The job losses, together with a series of other initiatives in Sainsbury's
head and area offices, are expected to lead to annual cost savings of about
Pounds 50m. Sainsbury expects to make a provision of between Pounds 10m and
Pounds 20m to cover the redundancy costs in its current year results.
