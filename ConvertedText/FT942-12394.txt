FT  29 APR 94 / International Company News: BNL elects chiefs to pilot
sell-off

Shareholders in Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, the Italian Treasury-controlled
bank, yesterday elected a new chairman and managing director to pilot the
group into the private sector.
Mr Mario Sarcinelli, former director-general of the Treasury and
vice-president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, is
to be chairman. Mr Gino Trombi, managing director of Banco Ambrosiano
Veneto, will join him as one of two managing directors.
The Treasury, which owns just under 55 per cent of the group, yesterday
promised Mr Sarcinelli and Mr Trombi its 'full support . . . in completing
the restructuring and strategic repositioning of the group'.
However, Mr Sarcinelli admitted after yesterday's shareholder meeting in
Rome that preparing BNL for privatisation would not be an easy task.
The sell-off would have to be confirmed by a new Treasury minister, and BNL
would need to be recapitalised before a sale can take place, he said.
As if to underline the difficulties, Mr Davide Croff, the group's other
managing director, warned yesterday that 1994 would be a difficult year for
BNL, partly because of the delayed impact of bad debts caused by the
recession.
