FT  02 NOV 93 / International Company News: Telecoms venture to be reshaped


   By PHILIP GAWITH

SIEMENS, South Africa's Reunert and GEC of the UK are to rationalise their
South African telecommunications activities with the aim of strengthening
their position in the local market and improving export prospects.
A new company, Siemens Telecommunications, will be created to focus on
providing infrastructure.
Telephone Manufacturers of South Africa (TMSA), an existing joint venture
between the three groups, will be restructured and concentrate on making
terminals, pay-phones and key systems.
Siemens Telecommunications will be 51 per cent owned by Siemens of German,
27.5 per cent by Reunert and 21.5 per cent by GEC. TMSA will be 41 per cent
owned by Reunert, 33 per cent by GEC and 26 per cent by Siemens, compared to
equal one-third stakes before the deal.
The companies are responding to the prospect of greater competition in the
local market after international liberalisation of the telecommunications
sector and technological developments which have forced rationalisation
among equipment suppliers.
The lifting of economic sanctions against South Africa will only enhance
competition further, with companies previously prohibited from doing
business there, such as Ericsson from Sweden, now free from restrictions.
Siemens Telecommunications will have annual turnover of about R800m (Dollars
190m) while TMSA's sales will be around R400m.
