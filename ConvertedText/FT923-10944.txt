FT  28 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Wellcome


For Wellcome shares to hold the issue price on the first day must be
reckoned reasonable going, even allowing for a degree of support from the
trust's advisers. The question is how long the trick can be sustained. On
the one hand, 800p must be regarded as the natural short-term level, having
been arrived at through lengthy haggling with every conceivable buyer. But
if the market moves decisively lower, holders may well reflect that since
the advisers cannot support the 800p level for ever, it might be as well to
beat the rush. Then again, a rise above 800p would soon run into unloading
of loose stock. But fundamentally, Wellcome cannot be that expensive.
Unusually, its forward multiple is now lower than Glaxo's.
