FT  04 AUG 92 / Observer: All in a name


Chung Ju-yung, founder of the Hyundai industrial empire and a candidate in
this year's South Korean presidential election, does not want foreigners to
think he is mooning around. So he has changed the English name of his
political party from the Unification National Party (a faithful translation
from the Korean) after advisers suggested that foreigners might confuse it
with the controversial Unification Church, alias the Moonies.
The new name is not without problems, however. The United People's Party
sounds as if it belongs in Stalinist North Korea and seems inappropriate for
an organisation led by a businessman with a personal fortune estimated at
Dollars 3bn.
But perhaps it is not so wide of the mark. After all, it was Chung who
pioneered trade ties with Pyongyang and recently broke a political taboo by
suggesting that South Korea's underground Communist party should be
legalised.
