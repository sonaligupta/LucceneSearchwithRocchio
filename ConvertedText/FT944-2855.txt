FT  15 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading


   By JEFFREY BROWN


Stock index futures moved ahead strongly in improved turnover, with the
session marked by the almost complete absence of selling pressure, writes
Jeffrey Brown.
The FT-SE 100 December contract had reached 2,978 at the close of pit
trading, while the March contract was at 2,997. The gains were 39 and 42
points respectively.
December's discount to the cash market was two points, or four points under
fair value, while March closed at a 17-point premium, or five points short
of fair value.
Dealers said there was good steady business throughout the session, with
active participation by a number of the bigger houses, notably NatWest
Securities and GNI.
Trading volume rose to 17,425 lots for the December contract and 10,706 for
March, of which more than 8,000 were thought to be the result of spread
trading.
There were few attempts to apply direction to the cash market, but dealers
said sentiment showed a clear improvement. At one stage the March contract
traded above 3,000.
Traded option turnover improved to 43,329 lots, from 39,329 on Tuesday.
FT-SE and Euro FT-SE business accounted for more than 29,000 contracts.
The most active individual option was Tesco, followed by British Gas and BT.
Tesco saw 1,930 lots dealt.
