FT  02 JUL 92 / (CORRECTED) International Capital Markets: Foreigners find
Japanese companies attractive


   By EMIKO TERAZONO

Correction (published 31 July 1992) appended to this article.
THE sharp fall in Japan's stock and real estate prices, and restructuring in
Japanese industries, are making the country's companies more attractive to
foreigners wishing to buy them.
Increasing numbers of Asian concerns have acquired Japanese corporations as
declining profits have pushed them into the arms of large Taiwanese, Hong
Kong, Korean and Singaporean groups.
Taiyo Fishery, a leading fishing company, sold Hayashikanesenkyo, a shipping
affiliate, to Evergreen, the Taiwanese shipping company, while the Wingon
Group, a finance and distribution group in Hong Kong, acquired 20 per cent
of Seiyu, the Japanese retail chain.
In the first half of this year, the number of mergers and acquisitions of
Japanese companies with overseas corporations surged 2.3 times from the
previous year to 16 transactions.
The value of transactions fell 43 per cent to Y13.3bn (Dollars 105m) in the
first half, according to Daiwa Securities.
The number of acquisitions by US companies rose to 10 from three in the same
period last year, while purchases by European companies halved to two deals.
CORRECTION
WING On, the Hong Kong finance and distribution group, holds 40 per cent in
a Hong Kong venture with Seiyu, the Japanese retail group. On July 2 the FT
stated incorrectly that Wing On holds 20 per cent of Seiyu.
