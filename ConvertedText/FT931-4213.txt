FT  11 MAR 93 / Observer: Overkill


Brand names ought to be one of a company's greatest assets. So why should
GEC drop the Ferranti brand name, a share of which it acquired along with
Ferranti Defence Systems from the fraud-broken Ferranti International in
1990?
Probably the best bit of the business remaining, the Edinburgh-based defence
systems is built on radar and navigation expertise. Though facing a tough
market post-cold-war, it will provide the radar for the Eurofighter and may
be healthier than the independent rump of Ferranti, still short of returning
to profit since the split.
But come the end of the month, the Ferranti name will vanish from the GEC
empire, at least. GEC Ferranti is to be swallowed up by Marconi Avionics,
and the headquarters will switch from Edinburgh to Rochester in Kent.
The change is to do with 'optimising the management of the businesses in a
tough international market', it's said. But Observer doubts that such
phrases will help what will soon cease to be GEC Ferranti salesmen to
explain to puzzled foreign customers why a snappy name with a good industry
reputation should disappear.
