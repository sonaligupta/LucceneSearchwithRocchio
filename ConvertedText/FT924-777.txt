FT  22 DEC 92 / UK Company News: OIS Pounds 15m offer comfortably
oversubscribed


   By MATTHEW CURTIN


INVESTORS have oversubscribed by 20 per cent for the 30m shares in OIS
International Inspection, the technical inspection services group to be
listed on December 30.
Mr Michael Sawbridge of Neilson Cobbold, the sponsoring brokers, said the
Pounds 15m offer was 'comfortably oversubscribed'. Private investors had
taken up Pounds 4m worth of the 50p shares, the remainder was taken up by
institutions, led by Friends Provident with a 20 per cent stake.
OIS's holding company would use the money raised from the listing to buy OIS
from Adia, the Swiss employment group busy divesting itself of its non-core
interests. OIS would use the Pounds 4m to eliminate most of its long-term
debt and help finance the purchase of new offices in Aberdeen.
OIS is expected to report a small decline in pre-tax profit to Pounds 1.58m
(Pounds 1.68m) on lower turnover of Pounds 45m (Pounds 47m) in the year to
end-December.
Mr Sawbridge said Neilson Cobbold forecast improved profits in 1993 - a
detailed forecast would be made in January - because cashflow would be
boosted by the reduction in gearing to about 5 per cent, new long-term
management contracts, and streamlining of the UK offices.
OIS, which specialises in safety, quality and environmental testing of
industrial installations, was at an advanced stage of talks with two big
clients, who were replacing their in-house inspection teams.
OIS already boasts BP, Shell and British Gas among its corporate clients.
