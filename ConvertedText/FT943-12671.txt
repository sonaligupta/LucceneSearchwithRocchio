FT  23 JUL 94 / International Company News: Commerzbank looks to expand in S
Africa


   By REUTER


   FRANKFURT


Commerzbank is considering buying a bank in South Africa, with a view to
expanding its activities in the country, Mr Martin Kohlhaussen, chief
executive, said, Reuter reports from Frankfurt.
The bank is considering enlarging its financial involvement in South Africa
by up to 50 per cent, he said.
With an exposure of more that DM1.6bn (Dollars 1.02bn) in South Africa,
Commerzbank was already more heavily involved than Germany's other big
banks.
Its lending covers trade and sovereign loans, as well as project financing
in the steel, aluminium and power sectors.
Mr Kohlhaussen said the bank planned to establish an 'operating unit' in the
country, possibly before the end of this year. It would do this by either
buying a bank in which it would take over management, or by setting up a
branch or subsidiary.
He said there were several small banks on the market which could be bought
for between DM10m and DM20m.
