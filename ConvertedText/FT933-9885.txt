FT  06 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Oil majors mixed


   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and ZHANG TINGTING


Shell Transport slipped as the market concentrated on the headline profits
from the Royal Dutch arm and refused to discount the effect of exceptional
charges.
The second quarter for Royal Dutch saw net income up at Pounds 619m, but
once the exceptional charge of Pounds 183m was removed, the underlying
figure was above Pounds 800m and at the top end of expectations.
Nevertheless, the market was unyielding and sold the UK shares down 9 1/2 to
633p.
Mr Nick Antill, oil analyst with Hoare Govett, said the shares were
overvalued but the results should not have provided an excuse to sell. Ms
Irene Himona of SGST said that on her forecasts the stock was offering a 4.8
per cent yield and presented a buy opportunity.
British Petroleum, on the other hand, firmed 2 1/2 to 306p after announcing
operating profits of Pounds 581m on a replacement cost basis after bouncing
back from the heavy losses of last summer.
