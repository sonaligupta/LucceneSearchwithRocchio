FT  27 OCT 92 / French government wins censure vote


   By Our Foreign Staff


FRANCE'S conservative opposition failed yesterday to muster enough votes to
pass a censure motion against the Socialist government in the National
Assembly, writes Our Foreign Staff. The Communists abstained, enabling the
conservatives to gain only 261 of the necessary 286 votes.
The motion was put forward in protest at an 'unrealistic' 1993 budget. The
opposition RPR and UDF parties consider the forecast 2.6 per cent economic
growth rate far too optimistic and fear that the budget deficit is running
out of control.
Mr Martin Malvy, budget minister, yesterday admitted that the current year's
deficit would be around a record FFr180bn (Pounds 21.5bn), against the
FFr89.6bn originally forecast. The FFr165bn deficit predicted in the 1993
budget is thought too low by many economists.
