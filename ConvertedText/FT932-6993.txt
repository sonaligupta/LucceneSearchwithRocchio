FT  26 MAY 93 / Letter: Expensive policy on older unemployed


   From ELIZABETH DRURY


Sir, Your report, 'The mystery of a shrinking dole queue in a sluggish
market' (May 20), highlights the removal from the unemployment statistics of
unemployed men aged over 60.
This phenomenon, targeted at older unemployed persons, is widespread across
Europe. Automatic (pre-retirement) benefits are paid, without the need to
register for work, to the unemployed aged over 55 in Belgium, Denmark,
France, Ireland and the Netherlands; and to those over 58 in Germany. The
Spanish unemployed have to take an early pension at 60, which entails a
permanent 40 per cent reduction in their old age pension. No official
statistics are recorded of these 'hidden unemployed', but the numbers across
Europe must now be significant.
Another 'new' UK policy of encouraging the unemployed to register for sick
benefits is also based on common practice on the Continent, where many older
workers 'retire' from about 55 on invalidity pensions. In the Netherlands,
early disability pensions are the main type of early retirement, and minor
disabilities are sufficient to qualify, since labour market conditions form
an integral part of the criteria.
The combination of these measures produces relatively low official
unemployment rates for older workers across Europe. This has allowed
governments to give lower priority to combating unemployment among over-50s.
But in view of demographic trends which will increase the numbers of older
workers in the next century, this could prove an expensive and short-sighted
policy.
