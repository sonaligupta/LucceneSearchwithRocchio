FT  01 DEC 94 / Taxi monopoly likely to be kept


   By RICHARD WOLFFE


Black taxi cabs appear to have won the fight to protect their 300-year-old
monopoly to pick up passengers on London's streets, according to a leaked
government report
The report, which is believed to be addressed to Mr Steven Norris, the
transport minister, recommends that taxi drivers should continue to have the
sole right to ply for trade in public. It also says that minicabs, which
must be pre-booked, should be licensed in London to conform to stricter
regulations.
But taxi drivers are today preparing to protest against the plans, which
they say will undermine 'the knowledge' - a three-year entry test. The TGWU
general union said: 'The plans include extending the so-called two-tier
system of licensing which would spread the use of untrained drivers.'
