FT  04 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities Futures and Options Trading


   By JOEL KIBAZO


Stock index futures rallied strongly in late trading, pulling the underlying
cash market higher after a volatile session in which dealers continued to
watch developments in the bond market, writes Joel Kibazo.
The March futures contract on the FT-SE 100 opened weakly at 3,250, selling
from one of the large US houses being held largely responsible. At the day's
low point, the contract was trading at 3,201, and at a large discount to
cash.
However, short-covering led by independent traders brought a recovery, as
did the firmness in European markets and encouraging US economic data. March
closed at 3,233, an 8-point discount to cash, after volume of 17,233
contracts.
Turnover in the Liffe traded options fell back to 41,832 lots from
Wednesday's total of 67,008.
The FT-SE Mid 250 March futures contract on the Liffe closed at 3,907 after
trade of 36 lots. Open interest was 447. On the OMLX, the same contract also
finished at 3,912, with 4 lots traded. Open interest on this contract was
around 2,867. On the OMLX, volume in the traded options was seven contracts.
In early editions of Thursday's FT, the volume in the Mid 250 on the Liffe
was incorrectly stated. It should have read 36 contracts.
