FT  22 JUL 93 / Letters To The Editor: Few realise real cost of a pension


   From Mr R W NEATE


Sir, Hugo Dixon unfortunately fails to appreciate that the cost of a decent
pension is not grasped by the majority ('The best judges', July 19). Hence
only a relatively small proportion of personal pension contracts take in
contributions other than the National Insurance rebates.
In Pilkington, top-ups were provided by the employer to those retiring in
1945-60 to ensure long-serving employees had pensions of up to 40 per cent
of final salary. Pensions generated by the base money purchase scheme
established in 1919 were not adequate, despite contributions more than
comparable with current NI rebates.
Under the current Pilkington approach to pensions, the employer contribution
is a defined percentage, but final salary type benefits are provided by the
trustees (50 per cent member-elected). If surpluses are generated, the
trustees decide the application; equally, if a deficit emerged, the trustees
would have to manage the situation, perhaps by cutting future accrual or
asking the members for more.
Lastly, on the question of linking pensions to a member's contributions we
also provide a scheme (like the State Earnings-Related Pension Scheme) in
which benefits are related to career long contributions, the contributions
being up-rated in line with an average earnings index. Again, it has 50 per
cent member trusteeship and a defined employer contribution.
