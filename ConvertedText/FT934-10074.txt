FT  08 NOV 93 / Athens to strengthen ties in Balkans


   By KERIN HOPE


   ATHENS


THE Greek foreign minister, Mr Carolos Papoulias, yesterday started a tour
of Balkan capitals aimed at underlining Greece's commitment to stability in
the region.
Greece's new Socialist government is anxious to repair relations with its
Balkan neighbours, which were damaged by the emergence of a strongly
nationalist faction in the previous administration. Mr Papoulias will be
sounding out his counterparts on how their links with the European Community
could be improved when Greece takes over the EC presidency in January.
Greece is particularly keen to restore ties with Albania, where the
government has stepped up discrimination against the ethnic Greek minority.
In Belgrade today, Mr Papoulias will come under pressure from President
Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia to try to get UN sanctions against the former
Yugoslavia eased. However, Greece's stated aim of becoming a force for
regional stability is viewed with suspicion by western partners, given the
new government's decision to maintain its predecessor's close relationship
with Serbia.
Moreover, Mr Papoulias has not included Skopje, the Macedonian capital, in
his visits.
