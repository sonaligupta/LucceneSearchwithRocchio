FT  26 JUN 92 / Perot challenged to show evidence of dirty tricks


   By JUREK MARTIN, US Editor


   WASHINGTON


THE VERBAL war between Mr Ross Perot, the independent aiming to win the US
presidency, and the Republican Party has continued unabated, with Governor
Bill Clinton, the presumptive Democratic candidate, pointedly distancing
himself from the fray.
Mr Rich Bond, chairman of the party, phoned the Larry King Live television
show and challenged Mr Perot to produce on air one shred of evidence of
Republican dirty tricks. Mr Perot hit back: 'I can spend until midnight, but
I'm not going to do what you want on your terms.'
Earlier on the show, Mr Perot produced a letter of January 1990, from
President George Bush, thanking the Texan billionaire for having offered to
winkle General Manuel Noriega out of his refuge in the Papal Nunciature in
Panama. The warmth of Mr Bush's words, he said, showed there was no personal
animus between the two and that suggestions to the contrary were also part
of the scheme to 'redefine my personality.'
Mr Perot had implied on Wednesday that the media accepted feeds from 'the
Republican dirty tricks committee.' Several newspapers vigorously denied
this yesterday, pointing out that Mr Perot had produced nothing to confirm
his allegations.
The Texan clearly feels himself the victim of a conspiracy by the Washington
political and media establishment. In all his public appearances over the
last 24 hours, he has claimed that only he is in touch with the American
people, who can see through the attempt to lay him low.
Mr Clinton, sensing an opportunity in the Bush-Perot open warfare, said
yesterday: 'There's a billionaire, a millionaire and me - and most of the
American people are more like me.'
