FT  01 DEC 94 / Tories may lose committee strength


   By DAVID OWEN


The government was last night facing the possibility of having fewer Tories
than it expected on the committees examining this year's legislation. MPs
last night failed to agree how the removal of the whip from nine
Conservatives should be reflected in the bodies' composition.
The Commons selection committee broke up without agreement having been
reached. It is expected to meet again next Wednesday.
Opposition parties argue that the wiping out of the government's paper
majority by the removal of the whip from nine Tory Eurosceptics should mean
that it is no longer entitled to a majority on standing committees.
Last night's meeting came after Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker, told MPs
that the outcome of deliberations on the issue would not please all MPs but
would satisfy most.
The government's majority of 14 technically disappeared when eight
Eurosceptic backbenchers were stripped of the Tory whip after failing to
back the government over the European finance bill on Monday. A ninth MP
resigned the whip in sympathy with them.
