FT  01 DEC 94 / Economic Viewpoint: Much ado about a little tax


   By SAMUEL BRITTAN


Unfortunately, instead of analysing this week's Budget and the economic
prospects, attention is focused on how much the chancellor has saved up to
'give away' next time in the run-up to an election. In fact, no government
ever gives anything away; it merely takes more or less. But the vision of
the chancellor as Santa Claus is difficult to kill.
Even on conventional assumptions, the tax-cut discussion is spurious. The
small table shows that, based on the arithmetic of successive Budget Red
Books, the combined tax increases imposed by Norman Lamont in the first 1993
Budget and by Kenneth Clarke in the second Budget of that year amount to
Pounds 17bn per annum. This week's Budget remitted a negligible sum apart
from the temporary relief for business rates.
If the fiscal position turns out better than the Treasury's present cautious
estimates, the chancellor would still be mistaken if he did anything to
enlarge the Budget deficit or even to remit a surplus. The case for
achieving better than the Maastricht guidelines during periods of rapid
growth, to leave something in hand for a rainy day, is made by Mr Clarke's
own officials in the Red Book, and has been eloquently stated in a European
context by Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank's president.
In the few years from the late 1980s to the early 1990s, fashionable opinion
has swung from worrying about what to do with a budget surplus to an
obsession with what seemed to be an ever-growing fiscal hole; it is now
swinging back again. In fact, it is hardly possible to exaggerate the
cyclical and temporary elements in the fiscal swings, both past and
prospective.
The dangers of fiscal laxity are rather more subtle than financial alarmists
suppose, as we have seen from the number of times they have cried 'wolf'
over the US budget. Suppose then that Kenneth Clarke succumbs to siren
pressures from colleagues to remit some taxes in his next Budget. The small
table makes the extreme assumption that he will reduce the basic rate of tax
from 25p to 20p. It is, of course, most unlikely that he would do this other
than as part of a phased programme, the main benefit of which would be felt
after the election. It is also highly unlikely that everything available
would be concentrated on the basic rate. Some of it would be used to widen
the 20p lower rate band, and for other purposes.
But even on the extreme assumption of the table, the chancellor will only
have remitted some Pounds 10bn per annum, compared with the extra Pounds
17bn which he and his predecessor have levied in stages in their 1993
Budgets to plug the fiscal hole. If anyone wants to say that taking away 17p
and remitting 10p is a tax cut or a gift for which he or she should be
grateful, he or she is welcome to this funny use of language.
However, the absurdity is even greater. For announced tax rises represent
only part of the extra taxation imposed by government. Another part of the
increase arises from the automatic effects of economic growth on a tax
system which is indexed only for inflation and not for increases in real
income. The accompanying Treasury chart shows public sector receipts rising
from 36 per cent of GDP in 1993-94 to a projected 39 1/4 per cent in
1996-97. Translated into actual cash this increased tax-take is worth over
Pounds 25bn per annum. If two-fifths of this is remitted by incautious
so-called tax cuts, the taxpayer will still end up paying a higher
proportion of his income to the government than during the Wilson-Callaghan
Labour government of 1974-79.
Let us, however, pause from crystal-gazing about next year's Budget to
celebrate the virtues of the Budget we have. It provides for a rapid move to
correct the imbalances in the public sector finances. The public sector
borrowing requirement is expected to be at the 3 per cent level required for
Emu in the Maastricht treaty by the next financial year, 1995-96. In the
year after, 1996-97, borrowing will be little higher than the level required
to finance net public capital spending: that is, the current deficit will
have all but disappeared. The PSBR itself should vanish a year or two later.
This is all expected to happen despite cautious official forecasts which
many City analysts believe understate both the rate of economic growth and
the improvement in government finances.
The specific measures to counter structural unemployment are also on the
right lines. Their main defect is that they are on too small a scale. But
now the door is open, critics should push against it, instead of indulging
in political sulks.
Indeed, anyone who reads the Economic Assessment section of the Budget Red
Book will find that Treasury economists are more up-beat on the prospect
than Kenneth Clarke was in his Budget speech. The upturn is export and
investment led: half the growth so far in 1994 comes from an improvement in
the net trade balance, arriving at a time when UK growth is faster than that
in the country's main trading partners. The balance of payments constraint
has been relegated to the dustbin where it has always belonged.
Looking ahead, the Budget Red Book has an illustrative projection of the
growth of the national income in the remainder of the 1990s. The broad
picture is that nominal GDP - which can be regarded as the national cash
flow - rises by nearly 5 per cent per annum, of which 2 3/4 percentage
points represent real growth and 2 per cent the inflation rate when the
government's low inflation objectives are achieved.
It is a pity that these medium-term projections have been removed from the
chapter on the Medium Term Financial Strategy - which has been emaciated to
the point of near-extinction. In fact medium-term movements are less
difficult to analyse than short-term changes, which are inevitably jerky and
are influenced by outside shocks which are by definition unforeseeable. The
value of the medium-term projections depends on users being adult enough to
see them as trend rates of change and not a vain attempt either to foresee,
or to eliminate, the ups and downs of the cycle.
Another reason for wanting to emphasise the medium-term projections for
nominal GDP is that they form a sensible objective for policy. A medium-term
objective for nominal spending makes more sense than the present reliance on
a target for inflation alone, but it would still put a firm limit on any
inflationary overshoot. It would also be less dependent than the present
approach on real output forecasts and guesses about the capacity gap.
The tentative medium-term projections contain other interesting information.
We are given the Treasury's estimate of trend growth as 2 to 2 1/2 per cent
per annum. The projected actual growth rates imply that there is enough
unused capacity and unused labour for above-trend growth to the end of the
century, without igniting an inflationary take-off. If the projections are
anything near the right ball park, the unemployment assumptions made for
forecasting social security spending are far too pessimistic. For they
assume that UK employment will stabilise at 2.5m, just below today's level.
Although economic prospects may be the best for 30 years, we are still in
the early stages of the upturn when policy is easy. A very early rise in
base rates is required for its own sake and to underline the low inflation
commitment.
The case for increasing interest rates does not depend merely on
hypothetical reasoning about underlying growth trends and the size of the
capacity gap. In addition there is strong survey evidence that businessmen
are looking for a chance to raise prices. Above all, the world, and
especially the European, economies are recovering much more rapidly than
expected; and this feeds into costs and prices both via rising commodity
prices and, more fundamentally, by making it easier for British producers to
adjust pay and prices upwards. Over to the next instalment of the 'Ken and
Eddie' show next week.
