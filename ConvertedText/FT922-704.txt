FT  26 JUN 92 / Leading Article: Sunday trading


YESTERDAY'S DECISION by the House of Lords on Sunday trading brings welcome
clarity. The Shops Act 1950 remains the law of the land unless repealed or
declared invalid under the Treaty of Rome by the European Court. Local
authorities can seek injunctions stopping illegal Sunday trading without
having to promise compensation if the law is declared invalid. If it is, the
UK government could be liable to pay compensation to shops for loss of
profits on Sunday trading.
That is a wise judgment, because it places responsibility for sorting out
the mess over Sunday trading firmly with the government. Ministers can no
longer stand back and blame local authorities for allowing the law to be
flouted.
Their next step is clear: the Shops Act should be repealed without delay.
Sunday trading provides benefits to consumers in convenience and  - by
making more efficient use of capital - lower prices. A quick bill is needed
before the sabbatarians and shopworkers' unions mobilise the opposition. The
threat of having to pay millions of pounds of compensation to supermarket
groups if the European Court overturns the Shops Act should focus the Home
Secretary's mind.
