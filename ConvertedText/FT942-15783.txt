FT  13 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Motorola plunges as data fail
to lift Dow

Wall Street
Heavy selling of technology shares overshadowed good inflation news and
higher bond prices yesterday and the US stock market ended an uninspiring
session easier across the board, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 7.14 at 3,681.69,
having spent the entire day no more than a few points off Monday's close.
The Standard & Poor's 500 declined 2.30 to 447.57, while the American Stock
Exchange composite shed 0.97 to 439.69 and the Nasdaq composite fell 8.89 to
739.22. Trading volume on the New York SE amounted to 258m shares.
The first leg of the eagerly awaited March inflation data produced no
surprises. The Labor Department reported that producer prices rose by 0.2
per cent last month, and that core producer prices, a measure which excludes
the volatile food and energy components, were also up 0.2 per cent.
Both sets of figures were in line with analysts' forecasts, and helped to
reassure investors that inflation is not rising sharply alongside the
rapidly growing economy.
The bond market reacted well, with the benchmark 30-year bond rising
slightly, lowering the yield to under 7.2 per cent.
The positive PPI raised hopes that the consumer prices index, due out today,
will also show no sign of resurgent inflation. The stock market, however,
was unable to hold on to its early gains achieved in the wake of the PPI
report. By mid-morning, the Dow, along with other indices, had slipped into
negative territory, where it remained, under pressure from sharply weaker
technology stocks, for the rest of the day.
The technology sector was hit by selling after Motorola produced
disappointing results late on Monday, and after the Semiconductor Industry
Association yesterday reported a flat reading on March sales.
Motorola plunged Dollars 12 1/8 to Dollars 94 7/8 in volume of 8.7m shares,
continuing a sell-off that had started in after-hours' trading on Monday.
Texas Instruments dropped Dollars 5 5/8 to Dollars 73, Compaq Dollars 3 3/8
to Dollars 100 7/8 , Micron Technology Dollars 5 to Dollars 86 3/8 and
National Semiconductor Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 19 1/4 .
McDonnell Douglas rose Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 111 3/4 in anticipation that
the company would announce that it had won a Dollars 400m contract to launch
satellites for a mobile phone system.
International Paper slipped Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 65 5/8 after the market
was unimpressed with its first-quarter earnings of Dollars 72m, which were
below analysts' forecasts.
On the Nasdaq market, big technology stocks mostly fell.
Canada
Toronto was slightly softer on weak base metal issues and a rocky
performance from real estate shares. The TSE 300 index finished a modest 7.6
off at 4,295.4, but rises and falls were almost evenly matched. Volume was
55.7m shares.
Mexico
Mexican equities reversed early losses to close higher, buoyed by rumours
that the government was about to announce a package of fiscal measures to
help Mexican companies. But a presidential spokeswoman said President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari had no such speech planned.
The IPC index, which on Monday closed at its lowest since last November,
ended 34.68 better at 2,243.16, a gain of 1.57 per cent. The index had
earlier fallen to 2,175.66 on expectations of higher domestic interest rates
and worries that first-quarter results, due to be announced in coming weeks,
would be disappointing.
