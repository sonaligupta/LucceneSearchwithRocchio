FT  23 APR 93 / Eagle Star to write some Lloyd's risks


EAGLE STAR has become the first UK insurance company to take advantage of
the enthusiasm of the Lloyd's market for consortium underwriting, in which
insurance companies underwrite business alongside Lloyd's syndicates.
The insurance subsidiary of BAT Industries has signed an agreement to
underwrite engineering risks, deal which should increase the capacity - or
capital base - of syndicate 1048. The syndicate, managed by Crowe
Underwriting Agents, had a stamp capacity of Pounds 34.3m in 1992. Eagle
Star is commiting less than Pounds 10m to the consortium.
