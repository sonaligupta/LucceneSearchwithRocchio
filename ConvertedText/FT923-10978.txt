FT  28 JUL 92 / World Trade News: EC offers offset tariff cuts


   By DAVID BUCHAN


   BRUSSELS


THE EC yesterday sounded out major partners in Gatt to see if they would be
satisfied with lower Community tariffs on other farm products as
compensation for the damage they claim to have suffered from EC
protectionism on oilseeds, David Buchan reports from Brussels.
The EC's executive Commission planned to discuss reaction to its offer, made
yesterday, with EC governments on Friday, so talks could end by August 18.
This is the deadline for the Gatt negotiating procedure, where Brussels has
offered to compensate its partners rather than make another change to its
oilseeds system.
