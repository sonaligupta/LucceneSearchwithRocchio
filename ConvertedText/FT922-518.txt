FT  27 JUN 92 / Letter: Safest form of currency exchange


   From KERSTIN WERNZE


Sir, As a student I have more time than money to spend ('Plastic has the
edge but don't ditch paper yet', June 20). When going abroad I have always
preferred to take my postal savings book with me. The interest is negligible
but there is no cheaper way to change money abroad. There are no
commissions, no fees and the exchange rate is competitive. Post offices are
to be found everywhere and the opening hours are usually much longer than
any bank's. On top of that it is also safe. I used my postal savings book
from Portugal to Hungary - no problem at all. No alternative for British
tourists?
