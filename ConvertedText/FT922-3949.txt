FT  09 JUN 92 / Gorbachev to head new global 'Green Cross'


   By REUTER


   RIO DE JANEIRO


MR Mikhail Gorbachev, the former Soviet leader, has been elected head of an
International Green Cross being set up at his own suggestion to fight damage
to the environment, Reuter reports from Rio de Janeiro.
The Parliamentary Earth Summit of spiritual leaders and legislators from
around the world voted unanimously for Mr Gorbachev at the weekend. The
forum - grouping personalities as diverse as Tibet's spiritual leader, the
Dalai Lama, US Senator Al Gore and singer John Denver - is being held in
tandem with the official Earth Summit.
Mr Tarzie Vittachi, the forum's spokesman, said the goal of the
International Green Cross was to do for the earth and its resources 'what
the Red Cross was founded to do for people on the battlefield'.
The idea was proposed by Mr Gorbachev at a previous meeting of parliamentary
and religious leaders in Moscow in 1990, he said. In a message to the
Parliamentary Earth Summit, the former Soviet leader pledged to work
actively for the new group.
