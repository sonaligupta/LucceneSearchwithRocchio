FT  16 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Domestic component in bourse
revival


   By Our Markets Staff


Bourses found both domestic and international grounds for yesterday's gains,
writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS, up nearly 2 per cent, was little affected by the US PPI figures,
finding other and various reasons for the rise, including lingering hopes of
a Buba rate cut tomorrow, as well as support from the futures market.
The CAC-40 index closed 43.50 higher at 2,258.52.
There was strong activity among media stocks. Canal Plus, in particular, was
one of the session's most active performers, adding FFr54 or 6 per cent to
FFr1,050. It was suggested that the group was helped by reports that the
government was reviewing its request for a financial commitment towards the
development of a cable network.
Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez, the construction group, up FFr8 at FFr592,
announced that its Dumez and GTM-Entrepose units would form a joint venture.
GTM dipped FFr28 or 5 per cent to FFr480. on the news.
Euro Disney, suspended limit down at one stage during the morning, recovered
to close the day up 85 centimes at FFr34.70.
FRANKFURT consolidated most of Monday afternoon's gains, the Dax index
showing a session rise of 20.42, and moved on again after hours with the
Ibis-indicated Dax closing at 2,178.91.
Brokers said that Monday afternoon's gains reflected Morgan Stanley's
raising of its recommended weighting in German equities. Turnover rose
again, from DM8.5bn to DM9.5bn.
Sentiment was lifted by Bayer which, unexpectedly, said that it would hold
the dividend at DM11. After a DM2.50 rise on the session the chemical group
rose another DM4.50 to DM380 after hours.
Relative strength continued in financials, in Siemens as it caught up with
other blue chips and in Volkswagen. But the most striking Dax stock gain was
in Schering: after an average response to Monday's progress report, the
pharmaceutical group put on DM37, or 3.6 per cent to DM1,073.
Mr Mark Tracey of Goldman Sachs said that there were six reasons for being
bullish about Schering: significant margin expansion in core
pharmaceuticals; Betaseron, the new multiple sclerosis drug; cost savings
potential; improvements in production techniques; strong cash flow; and
benefits from AgrEvo, the joint venture with Hoechst in agrochemicals.
AMSTERDAM firmed with strong interest seen in the heavily weighted issues,
DSM and Akzo Nobel, for example, adding a respective Fl 2.50 and Fl 2.80 to
Fl 124.40 and Fl 228.20.
The AEX index strengthened 3.37 to 427.27.
Hoogovens, which is expected to release 1993 results tomorrow that are
broadly expected to reveal another substantial loss, gained Fl 1.50 to Fl
68.70. Analysts expect the steel group to begin its return to profitable
operation in 1994, with the likelihood also that dividend payments will be
resumed.
Wolters Kluwer, the publisher, which satisfied investors with its 23 per
cent gain in 1993 profits, added Fl 1.50 to Fl 119.50.
ZURICH finished higher on the back of firmer US bonds, which rose after the
release of the US PPI figures. The SMI index rose 36.4 or 1.3 per cent to
2,906.9 but trading volume remained low.
Roche certificiates, the most active issue, put on SFr140 to SFr7,190.
SMH bearers slipped SFr20 to SFr880 amid doubts about further growth in the
watchmaker's market penetration, and the view that the Swatchmobile small
car project still had a long way to go.
Surveillance rose SFr70 to SFr2,110 after the inspection and verification
services group said that it expected its 1994 results to be in line with the
1993 outcome.
MILAN maintained its positive tone in spite of some selling ahead of today's
end of the monthly account. The Comit index added 4.28 to 678.06.
Demand from domestic funds and foreign investors helped some industrials and
blue chips higher. Fiat rose L33 to L4,998, Olivetti L55 to L2,510 and
Montedison L21 to L1,211.
Banco di Napoli fell L27 to L2,141 as Moody's, the US credit ratings agency,
said it had placed the bank's long-term credit ratings under review for
possible downgrade. The recently privatised banks remained firm: IMI rose
L27 to L12,640 and Credito Italiano put on L15 to L2,659. BCI added L125 to
L6,337, ahead of the first quotation tomorrow of its privatisation shares.
The new shares, sold by public offer at L5,400 without the L200 dividend,
were quoted on the London grey market yesterday at around L6,100.
MADRID gave credit to futures, foreign bourses and domestic bonds as the
general index rose 4.35 to 345.23 after a last minute spurt of buying.
Turnover rose to Pta32.14bn. There were specific interest rate hopes ahead
of tomorrow's Bundesbank meeting, and the interest-rate sensitive utilities
responded, showing the best gains of the day with Iberdrola, the most active
stock, Pta25 higher at Pta1,105.
TEL AVIV broke a four-session losing streak on buying by domestic pension
funds, the Mishtanim index shooting up by 13.2, or 6.75 per cent to 208.82.
This followed share price manipulation scandals which had dropped the blue
chip index by nearly 25 per cent from its 1994 high.
