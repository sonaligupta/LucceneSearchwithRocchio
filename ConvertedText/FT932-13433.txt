FT  23 APR 93 / People: Bowman bows out


The search is on at accountants Price Waterhouse for a new chairman of its
European firm, following the announcement that Sir Jeffery Bowman, the
incumbent, is to retire this autumn.
Sir Jeffery, 58, has been chairman since the creation of the pan-European
structure when UK and European firms combined in 1988. He has helped guide
the integration of the firms since.
'I could go on until I am 60 in 1995 but I have been in pretty senior
positions for about 11 years and I came to the conclusion that now was the
right time for a change,' he said.
Sir Jeffery was previously senior partner of PW in the UK from 1982-91, and
had been with the firm since 1958. He was joint chief executive of the PW
world organisation from 1990 to 1992 and joint chairman since 1992.
He says he plans to travel less, play more golf, stay at home and take life
a little more easily. 'But I have no doubt that something will come up,' he
adds.
An electoral college of about one-tenth of the firm's European partners is
currently considering candidates to replace him after he leaves on September
30. Nominations are expected to be complete by July.
