FT  28 APR 94 / Tory support 'at 15 year low'


   By DAVID OWEN


There was a fresh blow for the Conservatives last night when a Mori opinion
poll put Tory support at its lowest level for at least 15 years, writes
David Owen.
The poll, published in today's Times, gave Labour - with 47 per cent - a 21
percentage-point lead over the Conservatives on 26. Support for both parties
was two percentage points lower than a month ago. The Liberal Democrats were
up 3 percentage points on 23 per cent.
