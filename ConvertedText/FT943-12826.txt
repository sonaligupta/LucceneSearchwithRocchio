FT  22 JUL 94 / UK Company News: YRM losses deepen to Pounds 2.84m


Shares in YRM fell 5p to 17p after the building design consultancy reported
its second consecutive annual loss and again passed its final dividend.
On turnover down from Pounds 14.1m to Pounds 9.7m, pre-tax losses for the
year to April 30 deepened from Pounds 1.98m to Pounds 2.84m.
After a tax refund of Pounds 163,000 (Pounds 315,000) the retained loss was
Pounds 2.68m (Pounds 1.7m) and per share 20.27p (12.58p).
Directors said that competition and fee tendering for available projects
remained intense, and the need to reduce overheads had led to further
redundancies involving costs of Pounds 420,000 (Pounds 358,000).
YRM's overdraft facility has recently been extended to November and the
auditors do not intend to qualify their opinion on the group's financial
statements in this respect.
They do, however, intend to make reference to fundamental uncertainty
relating to the going concern basis and to the Hotel Praha project, again
without qualification of their opinion.
