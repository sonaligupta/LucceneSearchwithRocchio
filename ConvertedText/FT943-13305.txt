FT  20 JUL 94 / Second-quarter slip for SmithKline


   By PAUL ABRAHAMS


SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-US healthcare group, yesterday reported its
first year-on-year quarterly decline in pre-tax profits since 1990. Its
results for the quarter to June 30, dropped 1 per cent from Pounds 294m to
Pounds 291m.
The fall was partly because last year's figures were helped by a Pounds 37m
exceptional profit on the sale of the personal care business. Also
responsible were increased expenses, up from Pounds 584m to Pounds 593m, as
the company pushed new products to compensate for the US patent expiry on
Tagamet, its former top-selling product.
Mr Jan Leschly, chief executive, said: 'I think these are pretty good
results given the difficult environment.' Earnings growth would remain in
the high single digit area for the rest of the year.
Operating profits from continuing operations were up 21 per cent at Pounds
296m on sales up 8 per cent to Pounds 1.57bn.
The results benefited from currency movements. At comparable rates, sales
rose 6 per cent and trading profits 8 per cent. Mr Leschly said the company
had gained from hedging, but this would gradually unwind during the rest of
the year.
The pharmaceuticals division's trading profits increased 8 per cent to
Pounds 219m at comparable exchange rates, while sales rose 9 per cent to
Pounds 909m. Diversified, the newly acquired US pharmaceuticals benefit
management group, accounted for 2 percentage points of growth.
SB's two top drugs posted declines. Sales of Tagamet, the anti-ulcer drug,
fell 8 per cent to Pounds 165m, while Augmentin, the antibiotic, fell 1 per
cent to Pounds 166m. Mr Leschly said: 'We are not depressed by Tagamet which
has lost more than 50 per cent of the new prescriptions since the patent
expiry. We've planned for this. Augmentin was hit by the chaos in Italy and
a poor European 'flu season. It would be unfair to say Augmentin has
peaked.'
Growth had been driven by new products. Seroxat, an anti-depressant known as
Paxil in the US, more than doubled its sales to Pounds 70m while Kytril, an
anti-nausea drug, posted sales up 31 per cent at Pounds 24m. Relafen, an
arthritis medicine, rose 52 per cent to Pounds 60m, and sales of Havrix, a
hepatitis A vaccine, rose 84 per cent to Pounds 17m. Sales of these drugs
would reach Pounds 700m during the full year.
Consumer healthcare increased trading profits 6 per cent to Pounds 42m,
while clinical laboratories fell 6 per cent to Pounds 23m and the animal
sales side slipped to Pounds 12m.
Earnings per share rose 7 per cent from 14.7p to 15.8p while earnings per
equity unit increased 7 per cent from 73.5p to 79p. The company declared a
second quarter dividend of 3p per share, 5.854 cents per equity unit and
29.27 cents per equity unit.
