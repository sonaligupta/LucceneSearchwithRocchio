FT  15 JUN 93 / UK Company News: 92% take up for Saatchi rights


   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent


SAATCHI AND Saatchi's Pounds 73m rights issue was 92 per cent taken up.
Directors were 'pleasantly surprised' at the relatively high take-up,
particularly since more than half of the group's shares are held outside the
UK.
The group plans to use Pounds 36.5m of the proceeds to reduce bank debt;
Pounds 19m will go towards acquiring minority interests in European
advertising subsidiaries; Pounds 10.5m will be used to strengthen the
increasingly important media buying businesses; and Pounds 7m will be used
to invest in new information technology.
The issue was fully underwritten by SG Warburg and UBS. The largest
institutional investor is the State of Wisconsin Investment Board, with 8.99
per cent prior to the issue.
Saatchi shares dipped 1p to 165p yesterday.
British Airways announced yesterday that 92 per cent of its 1-for-4 rights
issue was taken up by shareholders at 245p a share. The balance was placed
by the underwriters at a net premium of 45.418p a share. BA shares closed
last night up 2p at 294p.
