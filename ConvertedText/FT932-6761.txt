FT  27 MAY 93 / Complaints to Ombudsman rose by 50 per cent


   By PHILIP COGGAN


COMPLAINTS to the investment ombudsman, who resolves disputes between
investors and members of Imro, the investment management regulator, rose 50
per cent last year, Philip Coggan writes.
Mr Richard Youard, the ombudsman, said in his annual report that the total
may have risen because Imro had given greater publicity to the scheme. The
overall amount paid in compensation following the involvement of the
ombudsman fell to Pounds 40,700 from Pounds 114,000. Many complaints focused
on alleged negligence by advisers. One example cited was an adviser who
failed to inform an 80-year-old woman of what would happen to her
investments when she died.
Claims ranged from Pounds 5 - a demand for interest on cash held within a
personal equity plan - to Pounds 350,000, involving an investor in a hotel
partnership in which the ombudsman felt unable to adjudicate. The ombudsman
said there were some hopeful signs of improvement in the industry, with
documentation getting better.
