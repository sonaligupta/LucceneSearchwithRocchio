FT  20 APR 91 / UK Company News: Berry Starquest net asset value falls


Net asset value per share at Berry Starquest, an investment trust managed by
GT Management, stood at 143.2p on January 31 1991, compared with 208.5p a
year earlier.
Mr Dennis Nicholson, chairman, said that the company's investment strategy
had remained largely unaltered, with the portfolio concentrated on smaller
UK companies. The year, however, had been one of the most difficult for
smaller companies, he said, and that accounted for the fall in net asset
value. During the latter part of the year the percentage of the portfolio
held in overseas markets had been increased.
Pre-tax profits advanced from Pounds 172,000 to Pounds 296,000 and, after
tax of Pounds 79,000 (Pounds 54,000), earnings per Pounds 1 share advanced
to 4.2p (2.3p). A single final dividend of 1.8p (1.5p) is proposed for the
year.
