FT  08 JUN 92 / Mobile balloting in Azerbaijan


   By REUTER


   BAKU


VOTING WITH THE HERD: Election officials in Azerbaijan took the ballot boxes
to the voters yesterday in the case of herdsmen unable to leave their sheep.
The presidential election result could herald the unravelling of the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and a decisive phase in the war
with Armenia, Reuter reports from Baku.
The Popular Front leader, Mr Abulfaz Elchibey, the likely election victor,
wants Azerbaijan to leave the CIS and UN peace-keepers on the Armenia
border.
Under Mr Elchibey, this oil-producing Transcaucasian nation would lean
towards Turkey in its foreign policy, pursue free-market reforms and take a
cautious line on Nagorno Karabakh.
