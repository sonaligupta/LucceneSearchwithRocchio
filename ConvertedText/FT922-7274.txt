FT  19 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Ian Maxwell sued in High Court for
unspecified damages


   By RICHARD GOURLAY


MR IAN MAXWELL, the son of Mr Robert Maxwell, the late publisher, and
director of the company that was supposed to have managed most of the
Maxwell empire's pension funds, has been sued in the High Court.
The writ claiming unspecified damages was issued on May 8 by provisional
liquidators of Bishopsgate Investment Management where more than half the
Pounds 886m of pension money may have disappeared.
The action lists a series of transactions worth more than Pounds 400m where
Mr Maxwell is accused by Robson Rhodes, the liquidators, of breaching his
fiduciary duties as a director of BIM.
The new proceedings follow a similar writ brought last December against his
brother, Mr Kevin Maxwell, in which the liquidators sought damages of Pounds
450m.
Mr Cooper said yesterday that about Pounds 448m of the pension fund money
had either disappeared or had been wrongly transferred from BIM.
The black hole in the pension fund has hit more than 30,000 employees and
pensioners in Mirror Group Newspapers and the private companies who until Mr
Robert Maxwell's death last November had assumed their pensions were safe.
Some Pounds 238m are in the liquidator's hands although many of the
underlying investments were highly illiquid, Mr Cooper said.
Unlike in the earlier case against his brother, Mr Ian Maxwell has not been
required to surrender his passport nor have any of his assets been frozen as
a result of the writ.
Robson Rhodes is currently trying to establish whether the liquidators on
behalf of pensioners have a right to investments transferred to banks as
security for loans to the Robert Maxwell Group and other private Maxwell
family companies.
