FT  16 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Part-timers get few jobs with 'status'


   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor


TOO MANY higher-status managerial and professional jobs are regarded as
being unsuitable for part-time workers, according to a Department of
Employment study published in this month's Employment Gazette.
Only 16.5 per cent of Britain's 5m part-time workers, representing 23 per
cent of employees, work in the top five occupational categories and most of
them are concentrated in education, welfare and health.
The study says: 'Without arguing that all jobs can be done on a part-time
basis, it is clear that opportunities do exist and could be increased for
both men and women.'
In some cases, it is workplace or organisational culture that makes managers
reluctant to allow higher-status part-time work. 'This may be because it
just does not fit in with preconceptions about what constitutes a proper
job,' the authors say.
The study looks at six companies that have made a special effort to attract
higher status part-timers: KP Foods, British Gas, J. Sainsbury, Barclays
Bank, the Wellcome Foundation and ICL.
The key findings are:
Higher-status part-time work is not widely available in the workforce, but
opportunities are increasing.
Some employers are breaking down traditional barriers between jobs suitable
for part-time workers and full-timers, and a range of jobs, including
managerial jobs, is available.
Employers gain by retaining skilled and experienced staff.
Employers find that higher-status employees are as committed and productive
as full-timers.
Higher-status employees confirm that. They also gain from flexible working
arrangements and find that by working part-time instead of leaving the
labour market they retain their skills and get job satisfaction.
