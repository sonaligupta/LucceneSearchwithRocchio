FT  26 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading


   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE


A SLIGHTLY livelier day in the futures market, following Monday's dull
session, saw trading take place in a tight range, still with very little for
investors to focus on, writes Christopher Price.
The June FT-SE 100 contract opened positively at 2,842 but quickly lost
ground as sellers came in. It settled to trade in a tight 12-point range in
a roller coaster ride during which some good two-way business was
transacted.
The relatively mild reaction to improvement in Britain's GDP figures was
symptomatic, according to dealers, of the general drift in the London market
in recent sessions.
A positive Wall Street helped to push June into higher terrain, although
resistance was being encountered at the 2,843 level. A large order, said to
have originated at the close from Goldman Sachs, sent the June contract to
its high of the day of 2,846, before drifting off in final deals.
June closed at 2,844, around 2 points above its fair value premium of about
5.5. Volume was 6,638 lots, still poor but an improvement from Monday.
In traded options, British Steel was again the busiest stock, reaching 2,700
contracts. It had traded more than 7,000 on Monday. The overall volume
yesterday was 33,643 lots, of which 7,583 were dealt in the FT-SE option. BT
followed with 2,238 contracts transacted, and Rolls-Royce was next with
1,658.
