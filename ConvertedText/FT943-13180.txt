FT  21 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Second-quarter drop for First Maryland
Bancorp


First Maryland Bancorp, the wholly owned US subsidiary of Allied Irish
Banks, reported net income down 10 per cent from Dollars 31m to Dollars 28m
(Pounds 18.4m) for the second quarter of 1994. For the half year, net income
was Dollars 54.1m, against Dollars 59.5m.
Net interest income in the three months was down by Dollars 2.3m because of
a lower net interest margin while non-interest income declined by Dollars
9.4m, mainly reflecting a lower level of realised securities gains. However,
there was a Dollars 5.7m reduction in provision for bad debts.
Return on assets for the six months fell from 1.29 per cent to 1.13 per
cent. At June 30 non-performing loans of Dollars 83.6m represented 1.59 per
cent of total loans.
