FT  08 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Control Techniques in takeover talks


   By PAUL TAYLOR


Shares in Control Techniques jumped 83p to 468p yesterday after the
Powys-based electronic drives group announced that it was in takeover talks
with Emerson Electric of the US.
Emerson already holds 29.4 per cent of Control, but undertook not to
increase its stake under a 1991 standstill agreement. That agreement expired
at the start of June.
Control said that it was in discussions with Emerson 'which may or may not
lead to an offer for the ordinary shares in Control Techniques not already
owned by Emerson'.
The relationship between the two companies dates back to 1991 when Control
acquired 80 per cent of ICD Drives, a New York subsidiary of Emerson, in
exchange for 7.6m Control shares. ICD Drives was later renamed CT Drives.
Emerson's shareholding in Control was subsequently increased to about its
current level through a tender offer at 320p for 3.8m shares.
Under the terms of the original agreement, Control has acquired Emerson's
remaining 20 per cent stake in CT Drives for Dollars 7.9m (Pounds 4.8m).
