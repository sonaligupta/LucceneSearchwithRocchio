FT  12 MAR 93 / International Company News: BNL ahead 5% despite write-downs

BANCA Nazionale del Lavoro, the Italian Treasury-owned bank, reported net
profits at parent company level of L78bn (Dollars 49m) in 1992. The figure,
covering BNL's first year as a joint stock company marked a 5.1 per cent
increase over 1991.
The results reflected the effects of Italy's recession and the need for
substantial write-downs on securities following last year's sharp fall in
government bond prices.
BNL made L356bn in write-downs on equity holdings and bonds. In all, L985bn
was set aside in depreciation and provisions, of which L751bn went into the
bank's risk reserves.
Mr Giampiero Cantoni, chairman, said the results were 'positive' in a
difficult economic environment and worrying operating conditions.
In particular, the bank had built up its sovereign risk provisions to over
65 per cent of its exposure, in spite of the sharp fall in the value of the
lira against the dollar.
Total deposits in lira and other currencies rose by 8 per cent to L50,290bn,
while total loans increased by 7.8 per cent to L46,175bn on a similar basis.
