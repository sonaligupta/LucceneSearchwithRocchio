FT  20 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Creighton's rise held back by exceptional


Creighton's Naturally, the USM-traded toiletries and fragrances
manufacturer, yesterday reported a 9 per cent improvement in annual profits.
On turnover ahead 6 per cent to Pounds 9.05m (Pounds 8.52m), the pre-tax
line for the 12 months to March 31 emerged at Pounds 1.09m, against Pounds
1m last time.
The outcome, which took in a full contribution from the Fine Fragrances &
Cosmetics associate, acquired in January 1993, and an initial showing from
Dalton Young, purchased in June last year, was struck after an exceptional
charge of Pounds 149,000 relating to the company's withdrawal from a 'major
acquisition'.
Earnings per share were 14.2p (13.9p); a proposed final dividend of 5.5p
brings the total for the year to 7.7p (7.3p).
The group intends to apply for a main market listing.
