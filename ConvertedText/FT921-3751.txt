FT  12 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Simon maintains dividend but shares fall


   By ANGUS FOSTER


SIMON Engineering's shares fell 34p to 246p yesterday after the company
announced halved profits and an unchanged, but uncovered, final dividend.
Simon, the engineering, environmental and industrial services group,
announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 18.3m in the year to the end of
December, compared with Pounds 36.5m. The company blamed the recession,
which was deeper than expected especially in the US, and said this year
would again be difficult.
Earnings per share fell from 30.4p to 12.5p but the company is recommending
the final dividend be maintained at 10.7p for an unchanged total of 15.7p.
Mr Roy Roberts, chairman, said: 'Prospects are such that we think it's
reasonable to leave the dividend uncovered. I think we will earn enough in
the current year to cover the dividend.'
Turnover slipped to Pounds 514.5m (Pounds 545.7m) including Pounds 13.1m
(Pounds 56.3m) from discontinued activities. Operating profits of Pounds
26.2m (Pounds 38.7m) included losses from discontinued activities of Pounds
1.47m (Pounds 62,000 profits).
Sales and profits from the access division were affected by recession in the
construction industry. Operating profits fell to Pounds 4.7m (Pounds 12.1m).
Process engineering also reported lower operating profits of Pounds 5.1m
(Pounds 8.7m). The figure was dragged down by losses in the paper
engineering business, which has been affected by a downturn in the US, and
lower pulp prices.
But industrial services lifted operating profits 6.3 per cent to Pounds
15.1m. This included seven months of profits from Robertson. Environmental
services increased sales to Pounds 97.1m (Pounds 72.5m) but profits slipped
to Pounds 3.5m (Pounds 3.9m), partly due to restructuring costs.
The lower contribution from property disposals of Pounds 279,000 (Pounds
3.86m) has been taken above the line as exceptional income for the first
time. There was also an exceptional charge of Pounds 2.97m (Pounds 4.17m)
for rationalisation costs, including 750 redundancies.
Interest charges more than doubled to Pounds 5.92m (Pounds 2.24m),
reflecting borrowings taken on to purchase Robertson. Net debt at year end
was Pounds 37m for gearing of 30.5 per cent.
COMMENT
Yesterday's sharp fall in Simon's share price looks a little harsh,
especially since it has already underperformed its sector by more than 50
per cent over the last 12 months. The reason for the fall is simple.
Although dividends have been maintained, the market is now worried this
year's will also be uncovered, and therefore probably cut. The company is
cautious about the year so far, but a number of factors will work in its
favour, even if the access and process engineering divisions continue at
these depressed levels. This year will see rationalisation benefits rather
than costs. Last year's Pounds 6.5m extraordinary loss on disposals should
not be repeated, and Robertson will make a full contribution for the first
time. Forecast profits of about Pounds 23m give a prospective multiple of
17, while forecasts for 1993 of Pounds 35m brings the multiple down to 10.
But Simon is likely to benefit later rather than sooner from economic
recovery, and it is difficult to see much upside in the shares at this
stage.
