FT  02 NOV 93 / Hyundai founder guilty of fraud

MR CHUNG JU-YUNG, the founder of South Korea's Hyundai business group,
yesterday received a three-year suspended prison sentence for illegal
campaign practices during his failed presidential bid last year, writes John
Burton in Seoul.
Mr Chung, now honorary chairman of Hyundai, was convicted of embezzling
Dollars 64m (Pounds 43m) from Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI), the group's
shipbuilding unit, to finance his presidential campaign. He was also found
guilty of forcing Hyundai employees to work on the campaign.
Mr Chung said the money from HHI was from the sale of his shares in the
company and was not corporate funds as alleged by the government. Hyundai
employees who campaigned for him did so as volunteers. The Seoul district
criminal court said it would not imprison Mr Chung because of his advanced
age - he is 78 - and his contribution to the nation's economic development
as head of Korea's biggest conglomerate.
The allegations about Mr Chung's use of illegal campaign funds surfaced in
the closing days of last December's presidential election and played a
crucial role in his poor third-place finish behind the victor, Mr Kim
Young-sam. Mr Chung's United People's party subsequently virtually
collapsed.
