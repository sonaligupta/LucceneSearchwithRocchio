FT  30 JUN 93 / World Trade News: 'A last chance' for the Uruguay Round


   By DAVID DODWELL


IF 1992 was the year of lost opportunity, then 1993 may be the year of the
last chance to seal a trade-liberalising Uruguay Round deal, says Mr Arthur
Dunkel, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
In the introduction to the annual Gatt Activities Report, published today,
Mr Dunkel warns that governments in the industrial world seem to be having
difficulty 'in comprehending what the word 'competition' really means.'
He complains that by espousing protectionist concepts such as trade
management and bilateral reciprocity, industrial countries are jeopardising
the gains of 45 years of trade liberalising work by the Gatt: 'Had Gatt
tried to expand world trade through such a philosophy, then the world would
now be a very much poorer place,' he says.
In a strong but coded assault on recent US demands for managed trade
solutions to its trading difficulties with Japan - a subject that will be
high on the agenda at the G7 summit - Mr Dunkel says in the Activities
Report industrial countries appear to have forgotten what trade really is,
and what makes it happen.
Trade, he says, is based on competition, which in turn is based on
difference: 'Differences in access to raw materials, in wage rates, in
labour conditions, in education, in publicly- or privately-funded research
and development, in exchange rates, in labour productivity, in investment,
in standards of health care and in industrial and commercial structures.'
Leaders and powerful lobbies in the US and France in particular have called
for such differences to be ironed out in defence of jobs at home.
The recently-liberalising countries of Latin America and eastern and central
Europe have had 'a disillusioning experience' in dealings with industrial
countries, who have hindered market access as fast as liberalising countries
have eased access to their own markets.
