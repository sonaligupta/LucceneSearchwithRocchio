FT  23 JUL 93 / International Company News: Bankers Trust moves ahead to
Dollars 251m as credit provisions fall


   By RICHARD WATERS


BANKERS Trust, the US bank which has become one of the leaders in the
derivatives industry, reported net income for the second quarter of Dollars
251m, or Dollars 2.97 a share, a rise of a third on the Dollars 186m, or
Dollars 2.16, a year ago.
A Dollars 52m fall in provisions for credit losses, to Dollars 23m, and a
Dollars 30m rise in net revenue from equity investments largely accounted
for the improvement.
Higher revenues from trading in financial markets were offset by a sharp
rise in bonuses and other staff incentives and benefits, which were up by a
half from a year before to Dollars 303m.
The quarterly result pushed return on equity at an annualised rate to nearly
25 per cent, from 23 per cent last time.
First-half net income of Dollars 406m (after an accounting change which led
to a Dollars 75m charge) was up from Dollars 340m in the first half of 1992.
Net interest income - which includes trading-related gains associated with
interest rate and currency arbitrage - rose 27 per cent to Dollars 319m.
Non-interest revenues were up by 21 per cent to Dollars 832m, helped by a
rise in trading profits from Dollars 335m to Dollars 405m.
The Dollars 30m rise in net revenue from equity investments was partly
offset by other factors, including losses from the revaluation of
non-trading currency positions, resulting in total additions to non-interest
income of Dollars 70m against Dollars 37m a year earlier.
Mr Charles Sanford, chairman, said the figures demonstrated the consistency
of earnings across the company.
