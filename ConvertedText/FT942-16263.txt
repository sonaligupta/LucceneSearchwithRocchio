FT  11 APR 94 / Company News (This Week): Michelin - Other Companies


The world's largest tyre manufacturer announces its 1993 results on
Wednesday and is expected to report substantial losses. The French group
suffered a net loss of FFr3.19bn (Dollars 540m) in the first six months,
resulting from the downturn in the European automobile industry and
exceptional restructuring charges. At the time of a capital issue earlier
this year, however, the group said it was seeing signs of recovery in the
international tyre market.
