FT  17 JAN 92 / International Company News: Bear Stearns surges 400%


   By PATRICK HARVERSON


   NEW YORK


THE DRAMATIC improvement in Wall Street's fortunes in the past year was
reflected yesterday in the latest figures from Bear Stearns, the New York
securities house, which announced a 400 per cent increase in fiscal second
quarter profits to Dollars 77.4m, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The huge rise in quarterly profits, earned on revenues of Dollars 479m, up
from Dollars 247m in the second quarter of 1990, was achieved on the back of
buoyant equity markets and intense activity in the corporate stock and bond
issue business.
The most impressive performance came from Bear Stearns' investment banking
division, which thanks to a sharp jump in earnings from the underwriting of
equity and fixed-income issues, reported a 330 per cent increase in profits
to Dollars 98m.
Income from principal trading was also significantly higher compared to a
year ago.
Profits from trading mortgage-backed securities, Treasuries, corporate bonds
and securities in the high-yield and bankruptcy sectors more than doubled to
Dollars 238m.
