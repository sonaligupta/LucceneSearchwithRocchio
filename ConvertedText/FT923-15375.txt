FT  02 JUL 92 / House prices fall 0.5% on month


UK HOUSE prices fell 0.5 per cent last month after rising briefly in April
and May, Nationwide building society said yesterday.
An average house cost Pounds 55,671 in June, Pounds 253 less than in the
previous month, according to the society's house price index yesterday.
It appears that an improvement may still be some way off in spite of signs
of greater activity in the market after the election.
Nationwide said many people were still delaying moves because of fears over
job prospects and financial security.
