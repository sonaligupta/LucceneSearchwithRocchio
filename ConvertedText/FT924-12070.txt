FT  22 OCT 92 / International Company News: Bristol-Myers edges ahead in
third quarter


   By ALAN FRIEDMAN


BRISTOL-MYERS Squibb, the world's third-biggest pharmaceuticals company,
reported a 5 per cent rise in third-quarter net earnings, to Dollars 589m.
The modest improvement, struck on quarterly revenues 13 per cent higher at
Dollars 3.1bn, translated into earnings per share of Dollars 1.14, compared
with Dollars 1.08 a year ago.
For the first nine months, net income was also 5 per cent higher, at Dollars
1.62bn. Revenues were 7 per cent better at Dollars 8.77bn.
Mr Richard Gelb, chairman of Bristol-Myers, said international sales were
particularly strong during the quarter, recording a 24 per cent improvement
thanks to foreign exchange gains and 13 per cent without calculating the
effect of currencies. This compared with US domestic sales that rose 6 per
cent.
Mr Gelb said all four of the group's core businesses - pharmaceuticals,
consumer products, medical devices and nutritional products - had better
earnings in the quarter.
One-time restructuring charges caused Eli Lilly, the Indiana-based
pharmaceuticals group, to suffer a Dollars 268.5m third-quarter loss. In the
third quarter of 1991 the company recorded a Dollars 297.5m net profit.
Sales in the quarter were 10 per cent higher at Dollars 1.48bn.
Restructuring and other special charges amounted to Dollars 519.6m.
