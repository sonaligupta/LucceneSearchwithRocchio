FT  24 MAR 92 / Arts: Today's Television


   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY


Poor Rita Tushingham, you might think she had given only one performance in
her life. The billing for tonight's half-hour ITV drama reminds us that she
played the lead in 'A Taste Of Honey', which she did .....31 years ago.
Today she stars in a romantic story by NJ Crisp about a widower who puts an
advertisement in a lonely hearts column: Sunday Pursuit (9.00).
I had a pretty misspent youth, yet the number of times I listened to Radio
Luxembourg could be counted on the fingers of one hand. For some of my
contemporaries, however, listening to the 'station of the stars' under the
bedclothes was the high point of existence. Now it is only a satellite
service and 40 Minutes sys 'Farewell Fab 208' (9.50 BBC2).
The biggest argument among the jurors on last year's Banff TV Festival was
about a bizarre Australian programme called The Year Of The Patronising
Bastard. In illustrating society's mistreatment of the disabled it does some
questionable things itself. I thought it worked and that the disabled were
glad to be treated tough like anyone else. Others found it cruel. You can
judge for yourself at 10.25 on C4.
