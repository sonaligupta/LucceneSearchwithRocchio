FT  07 JAN 94 / Moscow urges western caution

Russia yesterday gave a clear warning to Nato leaders not to offer east
European countries and Lithuania membership of the alliance, as this could
boost extreme nationalist tendencies in Russia and undermine its reform
programme.
President Boris Yeltsin's spokesman, Mr Vyacheslav Kostikov, speaking before
Nato's summit in Brussels at the beginning of next week, said that an
eastward enlargement of Nato would enrage the Russian military and oblige
Moscow to contemplate creating its own politico-military organisation.
'I think that the army would exert strong pressure on the government and the
president to respond,' Mr Kostikov said. Eastern European countries, such as
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic and the former Soviet republic of
Lithuania, fearful of the consequences of domestic upheavals in Russia and
more Yugoslav-style conflicts in Europe, are all looking to the summit for
an offer of membership as soon as possible.
Anxious not to make President Yeltsin's task any harder than it already is
by boosting Russian nationalism and traditional paranoia about western
expansionism, Nato leaders intend to remain vague about offers of membership
and to refrain from giving any specific security guarantees.
Instead, they are expected to propose bilateral agreements between the
alliance and any former Soviet bloc state which desires them, which would
allow close military co-operation, including joint exercises and training
for peacekeeping missions.
'We don't want to give the impression that we're creating another dividing
line in Europe,' President Bill Clinton said earlier this week.
By their 'Partnership for Peace' plan Nato leaders will strive to kill two
birds with one stone: to include Russia and former Soviet republics such as
the Ukraine in the security partnership as well as assuaging the anxieties
of anxious eastern European states.
