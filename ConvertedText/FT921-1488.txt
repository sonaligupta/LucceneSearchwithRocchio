FT  24 MAR 92 / International Company News: Profits at Showa Shell Sekiyu
surge 160.9%

   TOKYO, SYDNEY


SHOWA Shell Sekiyu, the leading Japanese oil refiner and distributor 50 per
cent-owned by the Royal Dutch/Shell group, has reported that group net
profits for 1991 advanced by 160.9 per cent to Y26.53bn (Dollars 200.98m)
from Y10.17bn a year earlier. Sales were marginally down at Y1,660bn
compared with Y1,68bn, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
The company ascribed the large rise in group profits mainly to higher
domestic prices for oil and oil products and to the strong yen.
Group pre-tax profits rose 90.3 per cent to Y45.6bn from Y23.97bn. Group
earnings per share surged to Y97.14 from Y37.23.
The directors forecast group net profits for 1992 of Y21bn and group sales
of Y1,570bn. They put group earnings per share for the year ahead well down
at Y64.8.
A court injunction stopping Shell Australia sending takeover documents to
shareholders of coal mining group, Austen and Butta, has been extended to
Thursday, Reuter reports from Sydney.
Austen and Butta has rejected a 70 cent-a-share bid from Shell Australia,
owned by Royal Dutch/Shell, as too low. Shell Australia owns 49.5 per cent
of the target's ordinary shares. The bid values it at ADollars 67.5m
(Dollars 51.5m).
Mr John Fuller, of Gadens Ridgeway, the law firm representing Austen and
Butta, said orders made on Friday were yesterday extended in the New South
Wales Supreme Court.
