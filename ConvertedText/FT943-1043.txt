FT  26 SEP 94 / Economic Diary: Other economic news


Monday: UK chancellor Kenneth Clarke and Eddie George, Bank of England
governor, hold their monthly monetary meeting. No action is expected after
this month's base rate rise, but today's monthly monetary report from the
Treasury will provide the background to the discussions.
Tuesday: The US Conference Board publishes its September consumer confidence
index, with analysts on average expecting a slight rebound to 90, from 89 in
August.
Wednesday: US durable goods orders for August are expected to rise if the
volatile transport component recovers.
Thursday: Today's Bundesbank council meeting is expected to leave key German
interest rates unchanged ahead of next week's IMF meetings in Madrid.
Friday: UK Chartered Institute of Purchasing & Supply publishes its
purchasing managers' index. This, the first UK economic indicator for
September, will be scrutinised for signs of a slowing economy after last
week's CBI survey.
In the US, some analysts expect the Chicago purchasing managers' index for
September to fall again after declining in each of the past four months.
