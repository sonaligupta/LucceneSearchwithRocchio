FT  22 OCT 92 / Murdered politician linked to Mafia


   By ROBERT GRAHAM


   ROME


PALERMO magistrates have for the first time directly linked a senior Italian
politician with Cosa Nostra, the umbrella organisation of the Sicilian
Mafia.
This follows a six-month investigation into the killing of Mr Salvatore
Lima, the Euro-MP, former mayor of Palermo and the most powerful Christian
Democratic political figure in Sicily. Palermo magistrates yesterday
announced the issue of 24 arrest warrants and said the murder of Mr Lima in
March was a result of his involvement with Cosa Nostra.
This is likely to be a deep embarrassment to the Christian Democrat party
and those of his colleagues like Mr Giulio Andreotti, the former prime
minister, who have publicly defended his reputation in the wake of his
murder.
The magistrates, relying on information mainly supplied by 'super-grasses',
claimed the killing was ordered by a number of Cosa Nostra families because
Mr Lima had promised - but failed - to use his political influence to good
effect. It is widely believed that Mr Lima had undertaken to ensure the
harsh sentences handed out to Mafia bosses in the trials of the mid-1980s
would be quashed on appeal.
The great missing element in the mass trials concerned the political links
of the Mafia. Such links have been widely suspected but never proven beyond
vote-buying and collusion over contracts.
Mr Lima, a parliamentary deputy from 1968 to 1979, had long been suspected
of Mafia connections and his name appeared frequently in the parliamentary
anti-Mafia commission records. Palermo magistrates suggested he had occupied
a key position in the shadowy world linking organised crime with the
political parties and state institutions.
Mr Giuliano Amato, the prime minister, called a press conference yesterday
to deny that the government was watering down taxation measures in the 1993
budget.
