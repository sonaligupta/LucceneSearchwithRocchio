The BBC's public access series Open Space returns with a programme which to
some may sound self-serving: a defence of the BBC licence fee by an
organisation called Voice Of The Listener (7.40). However, VOL and its
moving spirit, Jocelyn Hay, are certainly not creatures of the corporation.
Indeed they are, when they feel the urge, highly critical of the BBC,
arguing, as in this programme, that it should be far more accountable to
licence payers.
Seeing how the Los Angeles police behave when they know that cameras from
World In Action are with them (8.30) you wonder how much worse they could
possibly be when unobserved. Fortunately (for the public) a secretly shot
video, now famous, shows only too clearly: a crowd of LAPD officers dragged
a black man from his car and beat him senseless with clubs.
C4 celebrates the 250th anniversary of the first performance of Handel's
Messiah with a live broadcast from Dublin where it had its premiere (8.30).
BBC2 repeats the excellent spy parody Sleepers, in two 90-minute episodes,
with Nigel Havers and Warren Clarke playing KGB moles in Britain (9.00).
