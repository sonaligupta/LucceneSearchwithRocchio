FT  27 OCT 92 / People: Peter Woods quits Fisons


Peter Woods has resigned as director of corporate affairs at Fisons.
His departure is the latest change in senior management at the troubled
pharmaceutical company following the abrupt resignation of the chairman,
John Kerridge, in January. Fisons has failed on several occasions in the
past two years to obtain approval from the US authorities for the sales of
some of its products, in spite of many hints that approvals were imminent.
Woods, who trained as a doctor, had been with the company for three years
after a career as a pharmaceuticals investment analyst with Barclays de
Zoete Wedd and SG Warburg. He had been head-hunted to the City from
healthcare company Smith and Nephew, where he was medical director. Roy
Thomas, Fisons' finance director, says Woods is leaving the company
'amicably' after a very stressful two years.
