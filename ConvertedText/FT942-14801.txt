FT  19 APR 94 / Shortage of homes 'inhibits market'


   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent


Too few people are putting homes on sale at realistic prices and this is
inhibiting a full recovery in the market, says a survey of more than 100
estate agents today.
The survey, conducted by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, says
a shortage of homes for sale is holding back the market even though sales
rose last month.
Mr Michael Pattison, institution chief executive, said: 'While buyer
interest grows as the house-hunting season proceeds, purchasers remain
hard-headed about price, frustrating the hopes of vendors who, although,
keen to sell, wait for significant rises in values.'
'We are encouraged by the evidence that there has been some upward movement
in prices. But . . . would-be sellers should be warned against expectations
of dramatic increases in prices.'
The survey says 77 per cent of agents in England and Wales said prices had
remained static in the three months to the end of March while 18 per cent
said prices had risen.
