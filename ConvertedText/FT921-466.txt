FT  28 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Opposition to focus London attack on Tory
marginals


   By DAVID OWEN


LABOUR will start with-drawing party workers from its safe seats in London
this weekend to concentrate its attack on Tory marginals in the capital.
The tactical switch comes in the wake of a Harris/LWT poll giving the party
a two-point lead in the capital and indicating that it is within striking
distance of making the gains it needs in order to put Mr Neil Kinnock into
10 Downing Street.
The Labour party will withdraw workers from seats that it holds with a
comfortable majority and from safe Tory seats to campaign in the 25 or so
marginals which it has identified.
The move was described by the Tories as 'the decision of a party that is
desperate'. Conservative Central Office said Labour had 'conceded defeat' in
the capital by admitting there were 'vast swathes' of London it could not
win. 'What they are saying is the best they can ever do is just scrape into
power.' The Conservatives hold 58 seats and Labour 23 of the 84 Greater
London seats.
The Tories - working, they say, to a preordained plan - will also step up
their efforts, putting emphasis on face-to-face contact with voters and
aiming to 'peak at the right time'.
The Liberal Democrats plan to conduct a weekend examination of canvass
returns to determine whether their list of targets should be modified.
The party's decision to concentrate on seats where it has strong council
representation has produced a set of priorities in which Sutton & Cheam
(Tory majority over Lib Dem 15,718) is a top-drawer target, but Islington
South and Finsbury (Labour majority over Lib Dem 805) is not.
