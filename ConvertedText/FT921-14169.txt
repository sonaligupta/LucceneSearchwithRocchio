FT  17 JAN 92 / Letter: If only business could be taken elsewhere


   From Mr IAN S GOULD


Sir, While agreeing practically without reservation with Christopher Lorenz
('When service with a smile is missing by a mile', January 10),
unfortunately he pricked his own balloon of contentions in his very last
sentence, ie, 'take their business elsewhere'.
I am sure that Mr Lorenz is knowledgeable about IATA, the supra-national and
super-powerful union of the skies - aided by many cash-hungry exchequers,
and that where businessmen are concerned the option is either BA or its pool
partner.
Time being important, one frequently elects to travel BA after much
screaming to travel agents about Hobson's choice.
Oh, if only the opportunity existed for us to take our business, on numerous
occasions, somewhere else]
