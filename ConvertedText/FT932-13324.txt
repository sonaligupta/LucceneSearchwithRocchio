FT  23 APR 93 / International Company News: Tokyo Steel tumbles as rivals
cut capital spending

TOKYO Steel Manufacturing, a medium-sized Japanese steelmaker, yesterday
reported a 51.9 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y28.5bn (Dollars 257m)
for the year ending in March, as larger steelmakers announced cuts in
capital spending for this year.
Sales slipped 4.8 per cent to Y203.3bn following a sharp fall in demand from
the private construction industry, which has been seriously bruised by a
surplus of office and apartments in the two largest cities, Tokyo and Osaka.
The company also reported that weakening demand led to tougher price
competition among Japanese makers. Larger makers export about 20 per cent of
their production, but Tokyo Steel depends for about 90 per cent of its sales
on a still-weakening domestic market.
Tokyo Steel hopes that a Y13,200bn economic package announced last week will
stimulate orders for public works projects, and is confident that the
private construction market will recover later this year.
But, for the year ending next March, the company expects a 13 per cent fall
in sales to Y177bn, and a pre-tax profit of only Y3bn.
Meanwhile, Nippon Steel, the world's largest steelmaker, announced a 15 per
cent cut to Y170bn in capital spending planned for this year, while NKK,
another leading maker, said its outlays would fall 29 per cent to Y145bn.
