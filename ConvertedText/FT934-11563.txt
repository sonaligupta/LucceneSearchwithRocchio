FT  30 OCT 93 / Markets: Housing now 'more affordable' - At a glance


British housing is more affordable than it has been for a decade, according
to a report by TSB this week. The Affordability index calculates the
proportion of the take-home pay of a first time buyer which is needed to
service the mortgage on the average first-time home. As the graph shows,
that proportion has fallen to 26 per cent, compared with 65 per cent in 1989
and 1990 (when interest rates were at their peak). One needs to go back to
1983 to find a time when the ratio was as low.
