FT  13 APR 92 / UK Company News: Thomson wins LTV bid


   By MARTIN DICKSON


   NEW YORK


THOMSON-CSF of France, the state-controlled defence group and
Washington-based Carlyle Group have won the war for control of LTV's missile
and aerospace businesses with a joint offer worth Dollars 450m.
The US bankruptcy court ruled on Friday that the Thomson-Carlyle bid was
'the highest and best offer,' beating a Dollars 385m joint bid from two US
defence companies - Martin Marietta and Lockheed.
LTV has been operating under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code since 1986
and requires the court's approval to dispose of any assets.
Thomson and Carlyle, an investment company headed by Mr Frank Carlucci, a
former US defence secretary, came into the contest after LTV had agreed to
sell the businesses to Vought Corporation, a joint venture between Lockheed
and Martin Marietta, for Dollars 355m.
Thomson will pay Dollars 300m in cash for the missiles business, with Hughes
Aircraft, a General Motors unit, buying a 15 per cent stake in that
business.
