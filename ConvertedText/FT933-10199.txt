FT  05 AUG 93 / Observer: Next equation


By contrast with Sir James's former pupils, the Legal and General insurance
group didn't do anything to mark its chairman's 60th birthday last month.
Any celebrating will have to wait until next May when Sir James finally
steps down after 14 years at the helm.
However, bets are already being placed on who will take over the L&G chair.
Will it pick another business academic or, following the Prudential's
example, will it promote David Prosser, the current chief executive? Given
that Prosser has been in his job only for a couple of years and is still
under 50, the betting must be that Ball will be replaced by an existing
non-executive director.
BET chairman Sir Christopher Harding would seem the favourite but, given his
increasingly full portfolio, BAA chief executive Sir John Egan could stand a
chance.
Of course, L&G could be really brave and appoint a female chairman. Jones
Lang Wootton's formidable Honor Chapman, for example, has just got on to the
board. She is one of the very few women to have made it to the top in the
male-dominated property industry.
If Sir Christopher Benson, ex-boss of MEPC, is right for Sun Alliance,
surely a case could be made for Chapman at L&G?
