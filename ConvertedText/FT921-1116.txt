FT  25 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading


   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE


LIVELY trading in a tight range saw the futures market slightly down
yesterday, as UK election worries continued to undermine confidence, writes
Christopher Price.
While the March FT-SE contract opened at 2,450, trading was initially
unsettled by technical problems still being experienced by the market
following Monday's merging of the Liffe and LTOM.
An opinion poll showing the Conservative party ahead yesterday was largely
discounted by futures traders, and March was sold down - mainly by County
NatWest - to 2,438 in early trading. Aggressive buying by one trader then
helped it to rally, and by midday it had reached 2,456.
The contract drifted off in quiet afternoon trading and at one stage March
was at a discount of seven points to the cash market. It rallied later, but
weakness was noted in after-hours' trading as opinion poll worries returned.
March closed at 2,455, up 11 from the previous session but at a two-point
discount to the cash market. Volume was a dull 6,390 lots.
In the traded options market, turnover came to 30,507 contracts. The
Euro-FTSE was the most heavily traded at 2,839 lots, followed by British
Steel and Hillsdown.
