FT  02 JUL 92 / Investors spurn Telegraph's Pounds 84.5m issue


   By MAGGIE URRY, RICHARD GOURLAY, TERRY BYLAND and ROLAND RUDD


THE Pounds 84.5m share issue by The Telegraph, Mr Conrad Black's UK
newspaper group, has been spurned by private investors, raising doubts about
a number of other forthcoming issues.
When the public offer closed at 10am yesterday, applications for only 3m of
the 13m shares available had been received. The other 10m shares will be
taken up by underwriters. Another 13m shares had already been placed with
institutional investors.
The shares are now expected to trade at a discount to the 325p issue price
when dealings begin next Wednesday.
In part, the failure reflects the fall in the stock market in recent weeks.
Before the Telegraph outcome was announced, the FT-SE 100 yesterday had
fallen 27.3 points to close at 2,493.9, its first finish below 2,500 since
the general election on April 9.
The index has fallen nearly 9 per cent from its peak of 2,737.8, achieved on
May 11.
The lack of interest in The Telegraph's shares, after the last-minute
cancellation in June of the flotation of GPA Group, the aircraft leasing
company group, is expected to put pressure on other share issues in the
pipeline.
Last night Del Monte Foods International, the processed fruit manufacturer,
said it was delaying its planned flotation until early next year. It had
looked at floating the company as early as November.
A planned flotation of 3i, the venture capital group, had already been
postponed.
Advisers to MFI Furniture Group, the retailer, last night were setting the
price for its flotation. It is due to be announced today and is now expected
to be well below earlier indications of up to 145p, possibly in the 120p to
125p range.
The biggest imminent share issue is the sale of 330m shares in Wellcome, the
drugs group, which was expected to raise about Pounds 2.8bn for the Wellcome
Trust, the medical charity. Advisers to the Trust said last night: 'The
Telegraph is an entirely different cup of tea to Wellcome.'
Investors had particular concerns about The Telegraph's issue. They said the
price, valuing the company at Pounds 435.5m, was too high and they were
concerned that the company would still be controlled by Mr Conrad Black's
Canadian-based Hollinger Group, which retains a 68 per cent stake.
Mr Joe Cooke, managing director of The Telegraph, said the issue probably
went 'as well as it could have done in the circumstances'. He said: 'It is
always a problem with professional investors to invest in a company with a
majority stake.' But Mr Cooke said the company was not raising money itself,
and he expected 'quickly to establish a good track record with investors'.
He said he did not feel the pricing of the issue 'made any difference',
adding that Mr Black had been reluctant to sell below 325p as that was the
price at which he had bought shares from other investors in recent years.
Mr Nigel Higgins of NM Rothschild, the merchant bank advising The Telegraph,
said: 'We are disappointed but philosophical.' Since the issue was priced
last week the stock market had fallen, he said, and brokers had cut profit
forecasts for other companies in the media sector.
Mr Higgins said the outcome showed that 'clearly the retail market is
nervous at the moment'.
The Telegraph, whose flagship daily newspaper has a circulation of more than
1m, had expected its readers to apply for shares. However, only 5,655
applications were received for the public offer.
About 100 of the group's 1,044 employees applied for 250,000 shares.
