FT  27 MAY 93 / Court allows closure of 10 pits


   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent


BRITISH COAL'S plans to sell 20 mines to the private sector were advanced
yesterday when the High Court ruled that the corporation could proceed with
the shutdown of the first 10 pits in its programme.
Two High Court judges ruled British Coal could legally shut the 10 pits
since the corporation had complied with the court's conditions on
consultation with mining unions. The conditions were imposed last December
when the programme was declared illegal.
Lord Justice Glidewell said British Coal had tried to seek agreement with
the unions on the form of consultation. The independent element of scrutiny
demanded by the court last December had been provided by Boyds, the mining
consultants, who had reported on the economic viability of the 10 pits.
He rejected claims by the National Union of Mineworkers that the
consultations had been neither independent nor impartial.
British Coal welcomed the judgment.
The pits covered by the judgment are Cotgrave, Silverhill, Grimethorpe,
Houghton Main, Markham, Trentham, Parkside, Betws, Taff Merthyr and Vane
Tempest.
