FT  27 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Enterprise Computer in red


   By ALAN CANE


Enterprise Computer Holdings suffered a slide in turnover from Pounds 58.2m
to Pounds 16.4m in the year ended March 31, after a series of
disappointments left the Berkshire-based computing services group in the red
again.
In a note to the full-year financial statements, the auditors observe there
is a fundamental uncertainty over whether the company's bankers will renew
facilities and so ensure that the group and its subsidiaries 'will continue
in operational existence'. The auditors, Stoy Hayward, have not qualified
the accounts because of this, however.
The group made slightly higher operating profits of Pounds 4.9m, but
interest charges and rent resulted in a loss after tax of Pounds 1.96m
(Pounds 5.75m). Loss per share was cut to 2.6p (7.4p). No dividend is being
paid.
Enterprise has been changing market position from a seller of secondhand
mainframe computers to more broadly based computing services but Mr John
Small, chairman, said the process was taking longer than expected.
