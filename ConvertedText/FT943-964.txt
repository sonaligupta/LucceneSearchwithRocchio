FT  27 SEP 94 / Lecturers' union urges conciliation


The ATL lecturers' union yesterday called for the dispute between further
education lecturers and college principals over new contracts to be placed
in the hands of an independent conciliator.
But Mr John Akker, general secretary of the Natfhe lecturers' union, which
has held several strikes over the issue, said conciliation would be no use.
