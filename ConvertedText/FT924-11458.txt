FT  26 OCT 92 / Letter: Energy policy - needs of electricity customers and
coal priorities


   From Dr COLIN HASLAM and Others


Sir, If the privatised electricity companies are left free to build all the
planned CCGT gas stations then the power station demand for coal will be
much reduced within a few years. Public discussion has so far focused on
whether this reduction in the size of the coal industry is justifiable or
represents a coherent energy policy.
There has been no discussion about the implications of much reduced power
station demand for coal; the implications for the shape of the coal
industry; the balance between open cast, capital intensive deep mining at
Selby and traditional deep mining which is more than twice as labour
intensive.
Both British Coal and the government favour open cast coal which is cheaper
than the deep mined product. British Coal management is fiercely protective
of its near Pounds 2bn investment in the Selby complex, the cost advantage
of which is much less certain.
Open cast mining is expected to provide about 17m tons and the Selby complex
has a projected output of some 10m tons. It is a matter of simple arithmetic
to see that all other coalfields and pits will be left to scrabble for very
little if power station demand for coal drops towards 30m tons.
It is time for British Coal to disclose and justify the strategic priorities
which are behind its present and future closure lists. Our suspicion is, at
low levels of demand for coal, British Coal management is as much a threat
to British miners' jobs as the absence of a government energy policy.
