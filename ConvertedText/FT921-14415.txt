FT  16 JAN 92 / International Company News: Henkel expects profits to be
flat

HENKEL, the German chemicals and consumer goods maker, increased sales last
year by about 8 per cent, but net profits are expected to be about the same
as 1990's DM429m, Mr Helmut Sihler, chairman, said yesterday.
Confirming the purchase, announced in Stockholm last week, of the Barnangen
household and personal products company from Sweden's Nobel Industrier, Mr
Sihler said the acquisition had cost DM900m (Dollars 569.6m). It had
increased turnover in cosmetics to 10 per cent of the group total.
Henkel had achieved 'critical mass' in several European markets. 'Cosmetics
is now a very profitable business,' Mr Sihler said, although a greater
presence in Britain would be welcome.
Barnangen is best known in Britain for Aapri skin care products, in France
for Le Chat, and in Germany for Vademecum toothpaste.
Household detergents and cleaning products, a Henkel speciality accounting
for 32 per cent of group sales, comprise 15 per cent of Barnangen's
turnover. Personal products, including the Fa and Poly brand names, account
for a further 76 per cent.
The deal includes between DM150m and DM200m of debt, Mr Sihler added. It
would be funded from group reserves and borrowings.
Henkel expects sales in the current year to increase from DM12.9bn in 1991
to around DM14bn.
