FT  20 APR 94 / UK Company News: London International closes three plants


   By MAGGIE URRY


Mr Nick Hodges, the chief executive of London International Group, yesterday
announced the closure of three UK plants: a condom plant in Chingford, near
London, with 600 jobs going; a surgical gloves facility at Llanelli, south
Wales, with 240 jobs going, and the health and beauty aids plant in Dundee,
Scotland, cutting 60 jobs, Maggie Urry writes.
Another 100 jobs will be eliminated at the group's head office.
The redundancies and other costs will amount to Pounds 19m in cash, but LIG
hopes to recoup this from the sale of some of its health and beauty brands.
Savings are expected to amount to Pounds 6m in the first full year and
Pounds 8m in the second.
Mr Hodges said that in future the UK condom market would largely be supplied
from plants in Spain and Italy, where automation kept costs lower.
Surgical gloves would come from south-east Asia; Mr Hodges blamed pressure
on margins from the health service for the shift to lower cost production.
