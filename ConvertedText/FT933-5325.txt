FT  03 SEP 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report


   By REUTER


The London Commodity Exchange COCOA market was stuck in a weaker trend
throughout the afternoon, with the December position closing Pounds 2 above
the day's low at Pounds 820 a tonne, Pounds 9 down on the day. Dealers said
prices were being allowed to slip back in the absence of manufacturer
buying. At the London Metal Exchange COPPER prices built on early gains and
the three months position closed Dollars 17.50 higher at Dollars 1,953 a
tonne, despite a slight narrowing in the cash premium. Dealers said heavy
buying from quarters influential in supporting the market recently ensured
that there was to be no price collapse. Early firmness in the NICKEL market
was not maintained, with European merchant selling and profit-taking eating
into gains. The three months delivery price, which had touched Dollars
4,700, closed at Dollars 4,596.50 a tonne, down Dollars 32. Further losses
were registered in after hours trading. TIN prices mounted a small rally
from fresh 20-year lows, but remained depressed by poor fundamentals. The
three months position closed unchanged at Dollars 4,677.50 a tonne.
ALUMINIUM was steadier, regaining most of the week's earlier losses.
