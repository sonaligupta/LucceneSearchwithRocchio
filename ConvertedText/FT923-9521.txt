FT  05 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Ansaldo and Siemens flesh out railway pact

ANSALDO, the Italian state-owned engineering company, and the transport
systems division of Germany's Siemens group have fleshed out further details
of their preliminary agreement, signed in March 1991, to co-operate in
railway equipment.
The two companies have agreed to work together on developing a cooling
system for railway locomotives, based on technologies derived from both
sides.
The new system will eliminate the use of freon gases, while maintaining the
full operating capabilities of methods using CFC chemicals.
Ansaldo and Siemens have also decided to extend their collaboration into
areas such as high-speed trains, urban mass transit systems for the US
market and automated signalling equipment.
Precise areas of co-operation will be defined shortly, according to Ansaldo,
which is part of the Iri state holding company's Finmeccanica group.
The two companies hope that combining their resources will put them ahead of
the competition in developing a new generation of high-speed trains to
replace Germany's ICE or Italy's ETR 500.
The first fruits of the collaboration may be seen in Ansaldo's E402
locomotive, 70 of which have recently been ordered by the Ferrovie dello
Stato (FS), the Italian state railway.
The FS is thought to require about 200 units, meaning that future models may
incorporate cooling technology based on the Siemens-Ansaldo deal.
Earlier this year, Siemens passed an important first hurdle in its attempts
to break into the Italian market by being officially recognised as a
potential supplier to the FS.
Meanwhile, an Ansaldo official said the collaboration with Siemens meant its
cooling technology would also be used in future German locomotives.
