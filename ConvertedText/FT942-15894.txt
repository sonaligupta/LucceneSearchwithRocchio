When people write 'I'm not a prude but ..' I mentally excise the negative
and change 'but' to 'and'. When BBC2 launches a series called The Net (8.00)
and co-presenter Susan Rae claims 'It's certainly not just for computer
buffs' similar instincts emerge. We are told this will be a magazine
programme roaming the information super-highway, reporting on the vital part
computers play in our lives.
Dispatches continues the investigation into Russian red mercury which it
began last year. Now they are saying that Russian scientists have used the
substance not only to build a smaller and more efficient nuclear warhead but
also to make a miniature neutron bomb which uses fusion and is therefore not
subject to the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty (9.00 C4).
You have probably heard of the Birdman Of Alcatraz whose story is told in
the 1962 movie, repeated at 11.45 (BBC1). But what about the Fishman Of
Saughton Gaol? QED reports on Alex Torbet who was sentenced to life in 1979
for murder and, while serving his time, has become an expert on fish
breeding (9.30 BBC1).
