FT  08 NOV 94 / BAe plea over Airbus decision


   By RODERICK ORAM


British Aerospace could lose its role as Airbus's wing designer and supplier
if the government fails to buy the new European-made military transport
aircraft, Mr Julian Tapp, BAe's chief economist, said yesterday.
Mr Tapp told the CBI conference that purchase of the Lockheed-made US rival
could force BAe to drop out of the European consortium which is offering the
Future Large Aircraft. Production and design of the FLA's wing would go to
Deutsche Aerospace, the Daimler-Benz subsidiary.
When Airbus tackled the next generation of wide-bodied aircraft, Dasa would
be able 'to migrate its newly developed large-wing capability straight to
the new project,' displacing BAe, Mr Tapp said.
BAe, Britain's biggest exporter, would lose not only foreign sales of the
military aircraft, but also those of Airbus's new large airliner. Britain's
aerospace skills base would be seriously diminished, he added.
'We need a government with an aerospace strategy that supports industry and
avoids this outcome,' he said.
