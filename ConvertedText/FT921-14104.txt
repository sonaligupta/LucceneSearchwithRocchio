FT  17 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Profit-taking dominates
continental trading


   By Our Markets Staff


PROFIT-TAKING was the dominant feature on most bourses yesterday, with the
effect emphasised in late-closing markets by Wall Street's opening decline,
writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT, closing early, saw the DAX index end only 1.16 lower at 1,666.34,
after Wednesday's 2.4 per cent gain and a 3.34 rise to 676.01 in the FAZ at
midsession. Thursday's enthusiasm for dealing subsided, volume falling from
Wednesday's DM10.1bn to DM7.8bn. But the short-term vogue for cyclical
stocks continued, said Mr Michael Geiger at County NatWest.
Chemicals fell out of favour after a rise of a few days, suggesting that
Germany at the moment is a traders' market. Bayer led the way down with a
DM6 fall to DM294.50 after a DM12.70 rise on Wednesday, with BASF DM2.80
lower at DM240.50.
Steels took over the running to the dismay of fundamental analysts, who
heard Thyssen's involvement in the purchase of east German petrol stations
(along with the retailer, Asko, which rose DM18 to DM6.50) advanced as one
reason for the sector's improvement. Klockner-Werke put on DM6.90, or more
than 6 per cent to DM118.40 although, said Mr Geiger, its 1991 results are
going to be 'dreadful', and its 1992 performance is likely to be worse.
PARIS concentrated on special situations, as its rise was interrupted by
Wall Street's weak start. The CAC 40 index went as high as 1,877.57 before
closing 13.44 lower at 1,860.19 in estimated turnover of FFr3.1bn after
FFr4.3bn.
Eurotunnel bucked the trend and jumped FFr1.90 or 4.2 per cent to FFr47.40
with 261,620 shares traded, on talk that it was close to resolving its
dispute with TML, the consortium building the tunnel.
Lyonnaise-Dumez recovered from the day's lows of FFr436.50 to close just 90
centimes down at FFr442.50 on a company statement late in the day that 1991
net profit fell by about 20 per cent from 1990 levels, a smaller fall than
the market had been expecting.
The luxury group LVMH fell FFr150 or 3.4 per cent to FFr4,270 on rumours of
downgradings or a rights issue.
Among smaller stocks, Perrier rose FFr30 or 2.2 per cent to FFr1,388 on
volume of 55,000 shares on hopes that the company's controlling shareholders
would have to make a full bid. The media group, Hachette, rose FFr10.40 or
7.1 per cent to FFr157.90 on news that the Italian businessman, Mr Silvio
Berlusconi, had offered to rescue the troubled TV station, La Cinq. Weakness
in US pharmaceuticals pulled Sanofi down by FFr44 or 3.8 per cent to
FFr1,090.
STOCKHOLM advanced in heavy trade, the Affarsvarlden General index closing
5.7 higher at 980.4. Dealers said that advances among cyclically-sensitive
shares, such as those in the forestry sector, helped turn the trend after an
earlier fall on profit-taking.
The forestry sector rose 2.1 per cent with Stora B closing SKr13 higher at
SKr286. Turnover was SKr777m, up from SKr721m previously.
HELSINKI's remarkable resurgence continued, the market ending at a 1992 high
in the biggest volume so far this year. The Hex index rose 16.58 to 893.70.
'Demand remains strong, there are no signs of an end to the rally', said one
broker.
Nokia fell FM2.5 to FM60 on the announcement that Mr Jorma Ollila, the
president of Nokia Mobile Phones, would replace Mr Simo Vuorilehto as the
industrial conglomerate's chief executive immediately and will take over the
chairmanship in June.
COPENHAGEN's CSE index was down 2.34 to 362.95 on profit-taking brought on
by fears over how Wall Street would react at the opening. Banks, insurers
and industrial all declined.
Novo Nordisk's fall of DKr18 to Dkr546 followed the decline in
pharmaceutical shares in London and Wall Street, and helped depress the
market.
OSLO industrials were underpinned by higher aluminium and oil prices, and
the all share index rose 2.86 to 455.32.
MILAN closed firmer on the first day of the February trading account but
came off the day's highs on profit-taking. The Comit index rose 3.57 to
551.03 in turnover estimated at less than Wednesday's L172.2bn.
Pirelli continued its recovery, closing up 7 per cent or L79 at L1,202.
AMSTERDAM closed mixed as Wall Street opened lower. The CBS Tendency Index
fell 0.1 to 120.2. Profit taking and a weaker dollar sent Aegon 20 cents
lower to Fl 127.00 while Amev closed 90 cents down at Fl 54.30.
ZURICH ended lower after two days of gains, turnover tailing off in the
afternoon after active early dealings. The all-share SPI index fell 4.5 to
1,106.7 after rising three points in mid-morning.
MADRID, which liked Wednesday's consumer price inflation data, decided to
worry about the subsequently published rise in the core inflation rate from
6.1 per cent in 1990 to 6.5 per cent in 1991. The general index closed 1.82
lower at 256.68, in volume estimated at around Pta17bn.
ISTANBUL soared 9.2 per cent to its highest level since February 27, 1991,
on reports that the government would reveal measures to boost stock market
activity on Saturday. The 75-share index rose 431.67 to 5,128.91 in turnover
of around TL500bn.
