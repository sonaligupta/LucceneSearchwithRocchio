FT  29 JUN 93 / FT Exporter (22): A useful instrument - Bartering and other
forms of countertrade are a key to eastern Europe / Countertrade


   By JONATHAN BELL


SEVERE hard currency shortages in eastern Europe look set to guarantee that
countertrade, despite its administrative complications and in-built costs,
will continue to play an important role in fostering business relations with
this region.
Countertrade comes in various guises, including 'goods for goods' barter and
parallel counter-purchase and counter-sale agreements. However, a technique
which is being increasingly employed is buy-back, often in relation to joint
venture operations designed to boost, in tandem with western partners,
eastern European manufacturing capacity.
A model buy-back arrangement involves a western company assisting with the
installation of plant capacity and transferring appropriate technology and
equipment - and subsequently buying back the product emanating from the
plant and selling it on at a suitable margin.
One west European company which is concluding buy-back transactions in
eastern and central European countries, is the giant Swedish furniture and
furnishings retailing group Ikea. The company is involved in a continuous
process of buying from eastern Europe and selling in western markets, as it
strives to reduce costs by locating new sources of supply and increasing its
product range.
Buy-back is an essential part of this process, as Ikea supplies an eastern
European enterprise (or an east-west joint venture) with machinery and
equipment to allow a plant to increase and upgrade production to meet Ikea's
quality conditions and purchasing specifications.
Thus, some western European manufacturers of the required equipment, largely
small and medium-sized enterprises, are also able to make sales to factories
in eastern Europe through Ikea, without themselves becoming a principal
party to the goods buy-back procedure.
Most of Ikea's arrangements involve the leasing of equipment to the east
European partner, according to Herbert Finck, Ikea's east and central Europe
director of trading services.
With the leasing arrangement, Ikea will then give that enterprise an export
contract in order to provide it with cash flow. The enterprise is then in a
position to pay the leasing fees from the revenue earned from the export to
Ikea of the resultant goods.
Mr Finck says that the west European sourced equipment is going into
existing plants and can be quickly installed in order to achieve a swift
increase in production capacity.
For the small to medium-sized west European manufacturer, riding on the back
of a giant operator like Ikea makes sense in the difficult trading climate
still prevailing in eastern Europe.
According to Mr Finck, such leasing-based buy-back arrangements are
structured with a repayment of between three and five years. Ikea usually
works on the basis of buying products worth three or four times more than
the value of the equipment put in.
Recently, Ikea supplied a Polish-based joint venture company with Pounds
300,000 of equipment, mainly drilling and planing machinery and equipment
for lacquering wooden lamps, which was sourced from west European companies.
The deal was struck on a leasing-based buy-back basis.
In another case, Ikea provided Pounds 500,000 worth of equipment sourced in
western Europe, to an enterprise in the Czech Republic. The equipment
included sewing machines and leather and fabric cutting machines.
A UK manufacturing company that has managed to find access to eastern Europe
through Ikea is the Wadkin Group, a Leicester-based wood processing
machinery producer. Such arrangements ensure straightforward payment to
Wadkin from Ikea. The UK-produced equipment goes directly to the east
European enterprise, and the overall arrangement provides a way around the
problems that a small to medium-sized company faces when dealing with the
eastern European market.
Geoff Stainton, a specialist east European marketing consultant working for
Wadkin, says that smaller-sized UK companies are facing an uphill struggle
in dealing with eastern Europe. Links established with a large company such
as Ikea are invaluable.
