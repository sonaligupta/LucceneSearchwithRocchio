FT  27 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Float likely to put Pounds 75m value on
Goldsborough


   By MAGGIE URRY


Next month's flotation of Goldsborough Healthcare, the nursing homes, acute
hospitals and homecare services provider, is expected to value the company
at about Pounds 75m.
Goldsborough's pathfinder prospectus, issued yesterday, showed a
pre-interest profit of Pounds 4.3m in the year to October 3, up from Pounds
2.5m. Turnover was Pounds 30.1m (Pounds 27.1m).
However, Goldsborough said on a pro forma basis, including acquisitions made
last year for a full 12 months, operating profits from continuing operations
would have been Pounds 6m on turnover of Pounds 35m.
Goldsborough has 26 care homes, with 1,238 beds, three hospitals, one of
which is a joint venture, and 30 homecare branches. Mr Graham Smith, chief
executive, said that differentiated the group from others as it could meet
the needs of a range of clients and take advantage of developments in the
healthcare sector.
Although the float is likely to raise about Pounds 60m in cash, with 65 per
cent of the shares being placed with institutions and the remainder offered
to the public, only Pounds 29m will go to the company, cutting debt to
Pounds 7.5m, while shareholders' funds will be Pounds 51.6m.
Kunick, the amusement machines company which holds a 50 per cent stake in
Goldsborough, is to sell all its shares. The proceeds will 'significantly
exceed' net book value of Pounds 18.3m. Kunick shares rose 1p to 16 1/2 p.
NatWest Ventures, which has a 40 per cent stake bought in 1992 for Pounds
10m, will sell part of its holding, keeping 10 per cent of the enlarged
capital, while Phoenix Fund Managers' 10 per cent stake will be diluted to
about 3 per cent. Management will hold about 2.5 per cent after flotation.
SG Warburg is sponsor to the issue and SG Warburg Securities is broker.
Pricing is on February 17, with the offer closing on February 24. Dealings
are expected to begin on March 4.
