halfway

SONY Music Entertainment, the entertainment arm of Sony, the Japanese
consumer electronics company, said earnings and sales fell for the first six
months to September due to the lack of Japanese hit records.
Pre-tax profits for the first half plunged 21.8 per cent to Y9.9bn (Dollars
93m) on a 1.7 per cent fall in sales to Y49.9bn. After-tax profits declined
16.1 per cent to Y5.9bn.
For the full year to next March, the company is pessimistic over prospects
for music hits, and projects a drop in profits and sales for the first time
in 12 years. Unconsolidated pre-tax profits are expected to fall 21.6 per
cent to Y17.6bn on a 6.5 per cent drop in sales to Y94.2bn.
Teac, a leading Japanese audio equipment maker, fell into the red for the
first six months to September due to the appreciation of the yen and
prolonged economic slump.
The company saw a non-consolidated pre-tax loss of Y4bn, compared to a Y460m
profit a year earlier. Sales fell 9.7 per cent to Y54bn, while it posted a
loss of Y4.1bn on an after-tax level, against a profit of Y190m the previous
year.
Teac said sales of its mainstay computer and information equipment fell 12.6
per cent from a year earlier, while exports declined 7 per cent as the
higher yen undermined overseas demand.
For the full year to March, the company expects a pre-tax loss of Y6.3bn on
a 12 per cent decline in sales to Y105bn.
