FT  29 JAN 92 / International Company News: US disk group unveils computer
memory system


   By ALAN CANE


STORAGE Technology, a computer disk drive manufacturer based in Louisville,
Colorado, yesterday announced a new computer memory which it believes will
revolutionise the data storage business.
Called Iceberg, the new memory has been widely promoted by Storage
Technology over the past three years as the answer to customers' data
storage problems in the 1990s.
The principal advance is a design which should ensure the system will never
fail completely. Iceberg applies techniques pioneered by 'fault tolerant'
computer manufacturers such as Tandem and Stratus; there is built-in
redundancy at points where the system could fail. There are, for example,
redundant disk drives, electronics, power supplies, cooling systems,
operator panels and data paths.
There is considerable intelligence built into the system. Mr Ryal Poppa,
Storage Technology chairman and chief executive, said: 'With Iceberg, a
global company will have access to its critical data virtually 24 hours a
day, seven days a week.'
Storage Technology's chief competitors in the memory market are
International Business Machines and EMC Corporation. The company emerged
from Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code in 1987 after a troubled period in
the early 1980s. It reported 1990 net income of Dollars 69.3m on sales of
Dollars 1.14bn.
US prices for Iceberg range from Dollars 1.3m to Dollars 3.6m. Some 140
customers are commited to buying the new memory.
