Mr Brian Quinn, chief executive of Coles Myer, Australia's largest retailer,
until 1992 and a former member of the Reserve Bank of Australia's board,
appeared in Melbourne magistrate's court yesterday, charged with 49 counts
of theft amounting to ADollars 4.8m (Pounds 2.3m).
Mr Quinn, aged 58, was also charged with conspiracy to defraud Coles Myer,
by falsely representing expenditure at his private residence as spending for
various stores, warehouses and other residences owned by the company.
Commander Allen Bowles, from the Victoria police's fraud squad, told the
court that Mr Quinn had spent some ADollars 6.1m on his house at County
Terrace, in Melbourne's north-eastern suburb of Templestowe. He said
ADollars 4.8m of this was falsely recorded against various Coles Myer
locations to disguise the total spending.
The Victorian police have been investigating allegations of corruption at
Coles for three years, and have filed a variety of charges against about a
dozen people who were either once employed by the company or suppliers to
it. These charges have included allegations that secret commissions were
paid to contractors, for example, and that quotations were falsified for
work done on Coles properties.
Mr Quinn was bailed to appear at a committal hearing on June 24.
