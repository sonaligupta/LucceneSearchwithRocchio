FT  29 OCT 93 / International Capital Markets: Warm welcome for Singapore
Telecom float


   By KIERAN COOKE


   KUALA LUMPUR


THE public offering for Singapore Telecom (ST), the island republic's
state-run telecommunications and posts utility, closed yesterday with
indications that shares have been heavily oversubscribed.
The Singapore government is floating about 10 per cent of ST in this, the
first phase of the group's privatisation.
The government has set a minimum value of SDollars 30.5bn (USDollars 19.5bn)
on ST. However, Singapore-based analysts say aggressive share purchases,
mainly by Singaporeans, could push the group's market valuation to between
SDollars 40bn and SDollars 50bn.
Analysts say ST's A and B share categories, restricted to Singapore citizens
and sold at SDollars 1.90 and SDollars 2 respectively, have been more than
three times oversubscribed. The government has said all applications for A
shares will be satisfied in full, while B shares will be allocated through a
ballot or partial allotment.
C shares, which comprise half the ST offer, are open to both Singaporeans
and foreigners on a tender basis, with a minimum price of SDollars 2. Given
the interest in the flotation and the amount of liquidity in the Singapore
market, analysts are expecting the strike price, due to be announced today,
to be high, possibly more than SDollars 3.
Trading in ST shares is due to start on Monday. The stock exchange of
Singapore, anticipating hectic trading in ST shares, has announced it will
double the length of its trading session, to 12 hours, from the start of
next week until further notice.
