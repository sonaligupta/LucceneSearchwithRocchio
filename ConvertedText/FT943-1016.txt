FT  27 SEP 94 / Sofirad chief Dutaret quits


   By DAVID BUCHAN


   PARIS


Mr Jean-Louis Dutaret yesterday resigned as head of Sofirad, a French state
holding company with media interests, following a judge's decision last week
to investigate his involvement in the Carignon affair. The judge is trying
to establish a possible link between Lyonnaise des Eaux bankrolling a
newspaper supporting Mr Alain Carignon's re-election as mayor of Grenoble
and the utility's subsequent gain of the city's water contract. Before
heading Sofirad last January, Mr Dutaret was a close aide to Mr Carignon,
who resigned as communications minister in July to contest the same charge
of being 'in receipt of misused corporate funds' as levelled against Mr
Dutaret. Meanwhile, pressure is growing on Mr Gerard Longuet to resign as
trade and industry minister in the row over improper funding of his holiday
house.
