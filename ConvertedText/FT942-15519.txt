brighter political outlook

   TOKYO


A potential solution to Japan's current political instability comforted
investors and the Nikkei index rose by 2.1 per cent, closing above the
20,000 level for the first time since March 24, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The 225 average advanced by 412.08 to 20,060.41 on arbitrage buying and
short covering, falling to a low of 19,672.23 in the morning session and
peaking at 20,103.42 in late afternoon.
Investors were encouraged by reports that the split within the ruling
coalition had been tentatively put aside, and that the seven parties had
agreed to support Mr Tsutomu Hata, currently foreign minister, as the next
prime minister to succeed Mr Morihiro Hosokawa who resigned last Friday.
Volatile share price movements prompted by concerns over a possible
political realignment as well as prolonged haggling in choosing the next
prime minister, had sapped investor confidence during the previous few days.
The yen also stabilised on hopes of an early resumption in trade talks with
the US.
Volume rose to 341m shares against 263m. The Topix index of all first
section stocks rose 18.17 to 1,618.89 and the Nikkei 300 recovered 3.02 to
296.35. Advances overwhelmed declines by 850 to 180, with 134 unchanged. In
London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.98 to 1,330.12.
Low-priced resource stocks were favoured on hopes of an economic rebound.
Nippon Oil rose Y15 to Y725 and Teikoku Oil by Y31 to Y742. In non-ferrous
metals, Mitsui Mining and Smelting rose Y10 to Y393 while chemicals gained
ground with Showa Denko up Y13 to Y349 and Ishihara Sangyo Y14 better at
Y417.
Shipping stocks were bought as cheap laggards. Showa Line, the most active
issue of the day, rose Y27 to Y266 and Navix Line gained Y14 to Y364.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 202.70 to 21,289.22 in volume of 14.2m
shares. High-technology stocks were mixed in spite of the yen's stability.
Rohm, the semiconductor device maker, rose Y60 to Y3,850 and Nintendo, the
video game maker, fell Y70 to Y6,800.
Roundup
Many of the regional markets saw gains made earlier in the week eroded by
profit-taking. Bangkok and Colombo were closed for public holidays.

expected first quarter net income. The composite index jumped 61.11 or 2.3
per cent to 2,695.71 as San Miguel B shares rose 13 pesos or 6.1 per cent to
226 pesos following its 40 per cent rise in net profit.
AUSTRALIA continued ahead, boosted by offshore buying and a rise in futures.

cents higher at ADollars 17.24 and CRA 22 cents firmer at ADollars 17.22.

late afternoon.

as a danger area for travel. Citic lost 50 cents to HKDollars 23.70 and
Cathay Pacific slipped 20 cents to HKDollars 11.60.
TAIWAN ended down in slow trade although the paper and pulp sector was
strong on expectations that paper product prices are about to rise.
The weighted index fell 22.20 to 5,453.14 in turnover that declined to
TDollars 38.1bn from Tuesday's TDollars 52.44bn. Financials were the biggest
losers as speculators who drove prices up last week sold holdings before of

1/2 per cent unofficial badla or carry forward cost fixed on Tuesday.
NEW ZEALAND edged lower in a day of largely listless, direction-less trade.
The NZSE-40 capital index slipped 6.38 to 2,145.4.
