FT  28 APR 94 / World Trade News: Wellcome 'price cut' in Aids drug war


   By PETER WISE

Wellcome has cut the price of its Aids treatment AZT by 56 per cent in
Portugal, after losing a hospital con-tract to a Portuguese com-pany
marketing a cheaper version in a challenge to Wellcome's worldwide patents,
the Portuguese company said yesterday.
Mr Augusto Paiva dos Santos, director-general of Farma APS, said his company
had been awarded a contract to supply the Sao Joao Hospital in Oporto with
6,000 250mg capsules of Apo-Zidovudine, a form of AZT manufactured by Apotex
of Canada, at 33 per cent below Wellcome's previous price.
He said that Wellcome had since lowered the price of Retrovir, the UK
com-pany's version of AZT and its second biggest selling drug, by 50 per
cent and 56 per cent respectively in tenders to supply two other Portuguese
hospitals.
Decisions on the contracts to supply the Joaquim Urbano Hospital in Oporto
with 6,000 250mg capsules and the Sao Jose Hospital in Lisbon with 5,000
100mg capsules have not yet been made.
But Farma APS said its prices were lower than those tendered by Wellcome.
'The fact that Wellcome has lowered its prices to less than half of what its
is charging in the rest of Europe shows that it must be making a fabulous
profit on AZT,' Mr Paiva dos Santos said.
His company was investigating the possibility of registering Apo-Zidovudine
for sale in other European Union countries and in eastern Europe.
The Portuguese government has authorised the sale of Apo-Zidovudine on the
grounds that AZT is a drug in the public domain and that Wellcome's
application of Retrovir to treat Aids did not give it the right to prohibit
the sale of other versions.
Wellcome has said it will challenge the authorisation as a breach of its
patents.
