FT  11 APR 94 / Mixed performance by financial services sector


   By ALISON SMITH


The volume and value of business in the financial services sector rose
sharply in the first quarter of this year, although not as sharply as was
expected, says a survey published today.
The quarterly CBI and Coopers & Lybrand financial services survey showed an
overall rise in business confidence among respondents. Within that total,
however, the 'disappointment gap' between expected and actual performance
was reflected in a fall in confidence, or a flat response, among general
insurers and building societies. Securities traders also reported a fall in
confidence, because of an expected fall in profitability.
Although volumes of business across the sector rose at almost the fastest
rate for more than four years, that too included a variety of results.
Many elements, including banks, securities traders, fund managers and
insurance brokers, saw business volumes rise strongly. But building
societies saw a fall in business volumes in spite of expectations of an
increase.
For the sector as a whole, the survey found that business with private
individuals had increased in the first quarter and was expected to rise in
the second quarter, in spite of the tax increases which came into effect
last week.
Mr Sudhir Janankar, CBI economics associate director, said 'the impact of
tax increases may not have been fully taken on board' by those taking part
in the survey.
The pace of job cuts fell to the lowest rate since December 1990. But
optimism about employment prospects remains clouded since only smaller
employers are planning to create jobs. Large employers are experiencing only
a slowing in job losses.
