FT  06 NOV 93 / International Company News: La Generale to float 25% of
Union Miniere


   By ANDREW HILL


   BRUSSELS


SOCIETE Generale de Belgique, the Belgian holding company, is to sell a 25
per cent stake in Union Miniere, its metals subsidiary, through an
international offer of shares and warrants.
The stake is worth nearly BFr15bn (Dollars 412m) at current market prices,
but La Generale will raise half the total value initially and receive the
rest only if the warrants are exercised over the next year.
The sale will cut La Generale's stake in Union Miniere to about 50 per cent
and reduce the company's exposure to cyclical industrial stocks.
Buyers will be offered 3.08m units made up of one share and one warrant,
entitling them to buy a second share before December 15, 1994. The price of
the units, and the exercise price of the warrants, will be set on the basis
of the value of Union Miniere's shares on or about November 22.
Union Miniere has suffered in the last two years from the sharp drop in the
price of zinc. La Generale and its advisers on the sale - SG Warburg
Securities and Banque Indosuez - hope the offer will provide an opportunity
to speculate on the zinc market recovery.
