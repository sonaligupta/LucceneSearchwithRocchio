FT  04 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: No impoverishment prior to directing
The Mousetrap


   From Mr PETER COTES


Sir, It gives me no pleasure to contradict such an authority as Lord
Goodman, but this I am compelled to do in view of your Observer story,
'Sound advice' (August 19).
The facts rather than the 'fancies' of what has become a highly charged
matter are detailed in my recent autobiography 'Thinking aloud'. I was not,
as Lord Goodman suggests in his memoirs, 'impoverished' when Peter Saunders
asked me to direct The Mousetrap. I had three successful productions in
being at the time. It was not on Arnold Goodman's advice that I took a
royalty on the production as payment; I had already been offered 1 per cent
and his role was limited to drafting a letter for my agent to send to
Saunders suggesting 1.5 per cent.
While not as humorous as my old friend's book of anecdotes (how could it
be?), my own work is without doubt more accurate in dealing with 'Goodie's'
amusing encounters with theatricals.
