FT  14 MAR 94 / Inflation 'to fall' in west Germany


   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES

Inflation in western Germany is set to fall below 2 per cent, according to
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president.
'Expectations of stability will now be visibly fulfilled and confirmed
through the continuing decline in the rate of price increases,' he told
Dusseldorf foreign exchange dealers at the weekend.
His confident statement, which follows anti-inflationary pay settlements
last week in the engineering and public service sectors, will give support
to the strengthening view among economists that the bank's 5.25 per cent
discount lending rate could fall to 4 per cent or less by the year's end.
'With a February rate of 3.4 per cent we have still not reached where we
ought to be: below 2 per cent. But we are on the way,' Mr Tietmeyer said.
Economists expect the 2 per cent barrier to be breached early next year.
German inflation has fallen below 2 per cent in only two periods in the past
35 years, in the late 1960s, and again between 1986 and 1988.
Mr Tietmeyer shrugged off recent surges in world capital market interest
rates. The development stemmed from the US and Japan. 'It was neither a
typically German nor European phenomenon, and certainly not a result of
developments in our M3,' he said.
M3, the bank's favoured measure of money supply growth and potential
inflation, ballooned in January with an annualised expansion rate of over 20
per cent. International markets, already rattled by fears of rising US
inflation, took fright when the figure was released earlier this month.
