FT  23 APR 93 / International Company News: Inco announces 31 per cent fall
in net profits

   JAKARTA


INCO (Indonesia), which is majority-owned by Inco, the Canadian mining
company, yesterday announced a 31 per cent fall in net profits to USDollars
5.42m for the first quarter compared with the year-earlier, period, writes
William Keeling in Jakarta.
The company's mine in Sulawesi is among the world's lowest-cost producers,
and the results underscore the effect of low nickel prices on producers'
bottom lines.
While Inco (Indonesia) announced a fall in year-on-year first-quarter sales
to Dollars 39.95m from Dollars 41.41m, no figures were released for
production or sales volumes, or for actual realised price of nickel in the
first three months.
'From quarter to quarter, results can be delayed due to shipping schedules.
Until we get the full breakdown of figures, it's difficult to judge the
company's performance,' noted one foreign broker.
