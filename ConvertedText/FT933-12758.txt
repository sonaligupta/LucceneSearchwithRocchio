FT  22 JUL 93 / International Company News: Improved calls volume at GTE
offsets job-cut costs


   By MARTIN DICKSON


   NEW YORK


GTE, the largest local telecommunications group in the US, yesterday
reported a 6 per cent increase in second-quarter net income. It was helped
by solid growth in telephone calling volume, but held back by a Dollars 74m
pre-tax charge for job cuts.
The company announced net income of Dollars 438m, or 46 cents a share,
compared with Dollars 412m, or 45 cents, in the second quarter last year.
Revenues dipped from Dollars 5.06bn to Dollars 4.92bn.
The revenue dip reflected 'lower government-communications sales and
continued competitive price reductions to domestic long-distance companies,
which offset solid volume growth in telephone operations'.
The charge for the voluntary job severance programme worked through at
Dollars 46m, or 5 cents a share after tax. GTE said when this was excluded,
earnings per share rose 13 per cent to 51 cents.
Mr Charles Lee, chairman, said telephone operations had a strong quarter,
with healthy volume growth and lower domestic operating costs.
For the six months, net income totalled Dollars 898m, or 94 cents a share,
compared with Dollars 805m, or 88 cents in 1992 before accounting changes.
Revenues totalled Dollars 9.74bn, up from Dollars 9.89bn.
In telephone operations, minutes of use of GTE's network for long-distance
calling grew at an annual rate of 7.5 per cent, while total access lines
increased 4 per cent.
Around 6,400 employees, or nearly 8 per cent of the domestic telephone
operations' workforce, accepted various voluntary separation programmes
during the period. This will reduce future operating costs by more than
Dollars 250m annually.
Revenues from the telecommunications products and services business, which
includes cellular telephones, saw operating income rise to Dollars 87m from
Dollars 57m, on revenues down at Dollars 995 from Dollars 1.08bn.
The increase in income was attributed to higher revenues and efficiencies in
mobile cellular, as well as cost reductions in the government systems
business.
