FT  05 AUG 92 / Letter: Subsidies have been forgotten by energy users


   From Mr DAVID PORTER


Sir, Major energy users say that they are paying too much for their
electricity and this means that they cannot compete with their rivals in the
EC ('Large users step up demand for lower electricity prices', July 29).
These industrialists do not say that before electricity privatisation in
1990 their electricity was subsidised by the state, and that they enjoyed
further subsidies until March 1991. Neither do they admit that what industry
calls 'high prices' are only a fraction of what domestic consumers pay.
One solution is that they should make their own electricity. Many of our
members would be pleased to build them energy-efficient power stations. They
could then be quite certain that they were paying the right price for their
power.
They might prefer an electricity subsidy, but wouldn't it be much better if
the new EC president could persuade our competitors to get rid of theirs?
