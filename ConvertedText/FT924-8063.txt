FT  13 NOV 92 / Unita troops close in

   LUANDA


TROOPS belonging to Mr Jonas Savimbi, leader of the opposition Unita
movement, were yesterday reported closing in on a key southern city, AP
reports from Luanda.
Government military officials said the soldiers of the National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola (Unita) were marching on the port of
Benguela, some 500km south of Luanda.
Government military officials fear Mr Savimbi's strategy is to cut Angola
along the 1,350km Benguela railroad and take the southern half. The railroad
starts at Benguela harbour and passes through Huambo, Angola's second city
and the Unita leader's stronghold, Cuito and Luena.
Unita forces were also reported to be pressing in on the north around the
oil-producing town of Soyo. One of the captured provincial capitals is
Caxito, only 60km northeast of Luanda.
Mr Savimbi told Portugal's Radio Nova. 'I guarantee to the United Nations my
will that there should be no more war. But if I am provoked, I have the
capacity to fight for 10 more years.'
Mr Savimbi's fighting comments came as Mr Marrack Goulding the UN
peacekeeping chief, prepared to leave Angola after a mission to preserve
accords that ended 16 years of civil war which shattered this
once-prosperous former Portuguese colony.
