FT  13 NOV 93 / UK Company News: British Gas restructuring delay


   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES


BRITISH GAS has put off an internal restructuring plan that was due to come
into effect at the end of the month. However, the company said there would
not be a long delay in the plan to split the company's UK business into five
separate divisions.
British Gas unions suggested the company was having difficulty finding
people for the top posts - those appointments were due to be announced by
the end of November. But that was denied by British Gas yesterday.
'We've been working on this since the spring', the company said, 'and there
are a lot of formalities that need to be covered. It has just taken a bit
longer than expected.'
The restructuring involves cutting jobs by 20,000 over three years and the
company says there has been no hold-up to the redundancy programme.
British Gas could be forced to sell off its UK trading business - the part
which markets gas to households and industry - if the government adopts
recommendations made by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission in August. The
company said its five new divisions could be dove-tailed to fit with the
MMC's recommendations if they are taken up by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade
and industry secretary.
The re-organisation will split the gas sales business into a public supply
division, contract trading which sells gas to industry, installation and
contracting, and appliance retail. The pipeline and storage arm, which
accounts for 85 per cent of the company's assets, will also stand alone.
