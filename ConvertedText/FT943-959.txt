FT  27 SEP 94 / Avon launches target of creating 7,000 jobs a year


   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent


A strategy for the economic development of Bristol and Avon has been
launched with a target of creating 7,000 jobs a year.
Avon planners estimate that by the year 2001 at least 25,000 jobs will be
needed in the county to redress unemployment, another 7,000 because of a
growing workforce, and up to 20,000 new opportunities will be required as a
consequence of industrial restructuring.
The strategy has been drawn up by the Western Development Partnership, a
public and private-sector regeneration agency which was launched in Avon
last year. The strategy, which will be regularly monitored and updated, has
been endorsed by its members, which include all the local authorities.
A WDP taskforce which prepared the strategy says 17,000 manufacturing jobs
have been lost in Avon in the past five years. Local unemployment this
spring stood at 46,000 people, or 9.2 per cent, double the number out of
work in 1990. Sixty per cent of them had been out of work for more than six
months.
The strategy sets a target of reducing unemployment at a faster rate than
the UK average. It is intended to bring down the jobless rate more quickly
than the Avon average in six areas which have pockets of very high
unemployment.
The action programme for the next 12 months includes the promotion of the
area's competitive advantages, support for existing businesses, lobbying for
additional government and European funds and attracting inward investment.
Last month the Department of Trade and Industry agreed to provide Pounds
100,000 in the current financial year to launch a West of England
development agency, which will seek to win investment from abroad.
