climb to NKr565m

UNI STOREBRAND, Norway's largest insurance group, yesterday reported an
increase in 1991 net profits, before allocations, to NKr565m (Dollars
86.9m). The dividend is rising to NKr2.60 a share from NKr2.40.
The result exceeded analysts' forecasts which were for a profit of between
NKr140m and NKr530m. 'The increase to a large extent is due to international
business improving . . . while the contribution from life assurance
increased substantially,' Uni explained.
Group operating income last year rose by NKr614m to NKr19.54bn, while
operating costs were cut by 2 per cent. Included in operating income is
investment income which fell by NKr251m to NKr5.52bn.
Uni said the decrease in operating costs was consistent with the aims of the
merger - planning to cut costs by 10 per cent over two years. Storebrand
merged with Uni Forsikring last January.
Uni said that in 1991 it lost NKr504m on its shareholdings in Den norske
Bank, Christiania Bank and the mortgage group, Realkreditt.
Uni said it had liquidated financing activities. To this end, an
extraordinary charge of NKr212m was made against the 1991 accounts.
Due to a reduction in the interest rate for housing loans to 11.5 per cent,
11,000 housing loans were granted totalling NKr3.88bn, with total loans
reaching NKr22.8bn at the end of 1991.
