FT  16 DEC 94 / RPI advisers back loan interest


Advisers to the Central Statistical Office yesterday issued a report to the
Treasury recommending that mortgage interest payments should continue to be
included in the official measurement of the retail prices index, with some
small statistical modifications.
The recommendation is likely to irritate some economists, who argue that the
system of measuring housing costs should be changed. Sir Samuel Brittan, the
Financial Times' chief economic commentator and a member of the RPI advisory
committee, argued that the inclusion of mortgage interest payments distorts
the inflation data, since it means that the official RPI is boosted by
interest rate rises - even though interest rate rises are intended to curb
inflation.
The majority of the committee pointed out that the index is not only
intended to provide an indicator of inflation, but also to be a
cost-of-living indicator and is used to upgrade pensions and benefits.
