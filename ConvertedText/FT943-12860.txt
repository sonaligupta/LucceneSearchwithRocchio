FT  22 JUL 94 / Observer: Eyeballing


At last, Britain and China begin to see eye-to-eye over Hong Kong. Don't get
your hopes up, though.
It seems governor Chris Patten intends donating his corneas - after his
death - to an international medical organisation, which operates a flying
eye hospital.
Oddly enough, Zhou Nan, China's de facto ambassador to Hong Kong, apparently
made the same pledge yesterday while visiting the same flying eye hospital -
built into a DC-10 airliner - at Hong Kong's Kai Tak airport.
They really should be grafting at higher things.
