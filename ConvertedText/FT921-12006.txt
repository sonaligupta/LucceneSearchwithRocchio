FT  29 JAN 92 / International Company News: Procter & Gamble advances 7%


   By MARTIN DICKSON


PROCTER & Gamble, the US consumer products group, yesterday reported a 7 per
cent increase in second-quarter net earnings.
It said it had been helped by good volume growth in internationally markets,
where the company has been expanding aggressively.
Net earnings totalled Dollars 523m, or Dollars 1.47 cents a share, against
Dollars 490m, or Dollars 1.36, in the same period of last year. Net sales
rose 9 per cent in the October-December period from Dollars 6.86bn to
Dollars 7.51bn.
The company said the increases were due to 'broadly-based unit volume growth
in the US and international businesses'.
In the first half, net earnings totalled Dollars 1.059bn, 1 per cent up on
the Dollars 1.045bn recorded a year earlier. Earnings per share were Dollars
2.99, against Dollars 2.93, and net sales rose 9 per cent to Dollars 14.7bn.
The company said the increase in earnings from unit volume growth had been
partly offset by the impact of lower wood pulp profits, interest and
goodwill related to its Max Factor and Betrix cosmetics acquisitions, and
adverse foreign exchange effects in the first quarter.
Mr Edwin Artzt, chairman, said he was pleased by the improving trend in
worldwide unit volume growth.
During the first half the international business had grown at double digit
rates, and despite recessionary softness in the US, volume there had
increased 5 per cent, with growth in most leading product groups.
