FT  13 NOV 92 / Industry and City express some doubt


   By MICHAEL CASSELL and JAMES BLITZ


INDUSTRY and the City welcomed the chancellor's package yesterday but
withheld unqualified approval.
The measures were widely seen as a starting point for economic recovery for
industry, which is reeling from the effects of the longest recession since
the 1930s. But there were doubts over whether the measures would do enough
to boost confidence significantly.
Industrialists who had called for a big cut in interest rates were
disappointed by the 1 percentage point cut.
Some industry leaders wondered if the measures provided a coherent strategy
for long-term investment and recovery.
Others argued that the cheapest borrowing rates for 15 years, combined with
an effective 14 per cent devaluation of sterling, would provide a badly
needed boost to the economy.
Mrs Ann Robinson, head of policy at the Institute of Directors, said she was
'partially satisfied' with the package.
The Forum of Private Business - representing 20,000 smaller businesses  -
said the chancellor had offered 'only crumbs of comfort'.
Some dealers in the City claimed the package contained ingenious measures.
Others wondered whether it would do enough to stimulate growth.
The chancellor's forecast that the public sector borrowing requirement would
rise to Pounds 44bn in 1993-94 depressed gilt prices.
Sterling closed in London at DM2.42, a  1/4 of a pfennig up on the day, but
eased in New York to DM2.4156. Against the dollar, the pound closed in
London fractionally weaker at Dollars 1.524, but firmed in New York to
Dollars 1.5285.
The FT-SE 100 Index of leading shares closed at 2,726.4, showing a net gain
of 29.6.
