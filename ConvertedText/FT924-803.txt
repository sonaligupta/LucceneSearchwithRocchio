FT  22 DEC 92 / Observer: Where power disrupts . . .


These are trying times for west Berliners whose mains-powered electric
clocks have been running haywire, losing up to 12 minutes a week.
After many a ticking-off from irate customers, the city's power company,
Bewag, has at last identified the fault. Aiming to cushion west Berlin's
previously independent system at peak times, the company decided to import
power from the east European network.
It now transpires that Russian generating stations often diverge from the
standard frequency of 50 cycles a second, with the result that clocks and
such things as they govern in the old Comecon area have been inaccurate for
the past 40 years and have to be adjusted weekly - if not daily.
True, that may not have mattered to managers less worried about their
workers' time-keeping than about whether they would turn up at all.
It would seem that the Russians must have used quartz timers for their space
launches. But alas, Bewag has no similarly sophisticated way of satisfying
its customers' complaints.
Although charging the highest rates for electricity in Germany, it insists
that wayward clocks are a small price to pay for increased power reserves
until it can get round to rectifying the problem sometime in the middle of
next year.
