FT  05 JUN 92 / President backs curb on budgets


   By GEORGE GRAHAM


   WASHINGTON


PRESIDENT George Bush last night sought to revitalise his re-election
campaign by throwing his weight behind efforts to amend the US constitution
to require balanced budgets.
Mr Bush said the US political system had failed to meet its responsibility
to deal with the country's soaring fiscal deficits, and a constitutional
amendment was now needed.
'We've tried compromise, we've tried confrontation, we've tried quiet
diplomacy. . . tonight I'm more than ever convinced that a balanced budget
amendment is the only way,' he said in an evening press conference.
But Senator George Mitchell, leader of the Democratic opposition in the
Senate, sneered that Mr Bush's support for a balanced budget amendment was
'another example of him saying one thing and doing another.' Senator
Mitchell said: 'By submitting budgets with record deficits and then somehow
suggesting it's all someone else's fault, that's a familiar pattern in this
administration.'
The federal budget deficit is expected to reach Dollars 400bn (Pounds 219bn)
this year.
Supporters of a balanced budget amendment, which would have to be passed by
two-thirds of both the House of Representatives and Senate and then be
ratified by three-quarters of the states, were until recently confident of
winning a vote this year.
Although the amendment is expected to pass the House when it comes up for a
vote next week, opposition is now growing in the Senate.
Mr Bush added he had signed last night a bill cutting Dollars 8bn of
spending previously approved, although the cuts were significantly altered
by Congress from the list of rescissions he had originally submitted. The
cuts mainly involved an early end to Seawolf submarine construction.
