FT  05 JUN 92 / International Company News: Sappi expects European support


   By PHILIP GAWITH


   JOHANNESBURG


SAPPI, the South African paper and pulp group seeking to raise Dollars 250m
through a Euro-equity issue, is confident it has won considerable support
from European investors.
Mr Eugene van As, executive chairman, said yesterday he was confident the
group would achieve its target of placing at least half the issue abroad,
and perhaps do better.
The offer is the largest by a South African company since the lifting of
trade and investment sanctions.
The main aim of the issue is to finance Sappi's DM396.5m (Dollars 243.2m)
acquisition of Hannover Papier, a German fine paper group.
Mr van As said that although they would still have to 'see the colour of
everybody's money' - the issue is already massively oversubscribed with
demand so far coming from South African investors.
Mr Van As said his impression was that Sappi had been 'well received' while
investors remained cautious about South Africa. He said many fund managers
were still skittish about investing in South Africa for fear of criticism.
Many of the current generation of fund managers have also never bought a
South African stock.
Mr Richard Stuart of Martin, the stockbrokers who form part of the syndicate
managing the issue, said Sappi was a major cyclical share. With 65 per cent
of Sappi's earnings in hard currencies, the currency risk is considerably
diminished, he said.
