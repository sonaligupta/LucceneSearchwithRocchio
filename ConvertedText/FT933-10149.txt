FT  05 AUG 93 / International Company News: Corning to take Dollars 25m
charge

CORNING Inc, the US high-technology group, yesterday said it would take an
after-tax restructuring charge of Dollars 25m to Dollars 50m in the third
quarter related to its acquisition of Damon Corporation, a US medical
testing laboratory.
Corning said the Damon transaction would be slightly dilutive to earnings
per share for the next 12 months.
The company plans to issue about Dollars 200m of long-term debt and about
Dollars 400m of common stock in the second half of this year to finance the
Damon transaction. Corning completed its tender offer for Damon yesterday.
Corning also plans to increase its registered debt securities to Dollars
500m from Dollars 50m and has filed a shelf registration with the Securities
and Exchange Commission.
In June, Corning made an unsolicited bid of Dollars 370m for Damon in a move
to strengthen its position in the clinical laboratory sector. The
acquisition will help Corning compete with SmithKline Beecham for leadership
of the sector.
Walt Disney, the US entertainment group, has filed with the SEC for a shelf
offering of up to Dollars 1bn of debt securities. The company said it would
use the proceeds for general purposes.
