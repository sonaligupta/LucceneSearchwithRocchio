FT  20 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow in small fall after a
fluctuating session

Wall Street
After fluctuating through the afternoon, blue-chip stocks showed little
change by yesterday's close, but slumping technology issues pushed the
Nasdaq deep into negative territory, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 0.60 at 3,619.82, and the
more broadly based Standard & Poor's 500 dipped 0.08 to 442.54 on heavy
volume of 323m shares. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite
was 2.90 lower at 431.10, while the Nasdaq composite dropped 7.60 at 712.85.
At the opening bell, investors seemed willing to put the previous session's
41-point decline behind them, despite lingering uneasiness over Monday's
move by the Federal Reserve to lift interest rates for the third time in 10
weeks.
Stocks made steady headway during the morning, buoyed by improvement in the
US Treasury market, which suffered a sharp setback in the wake of the Fed's
tightening move. The benchmark 30-year government security was showing
moderate gains for most of the session.
The turnround partly reflected a favourable interpretation of a widening of
the US trade deficit in February. With a decline in exports contributing to
the trend, it suggested a slowdown in economic growth and an easing of
inflationary pressure, a happy development for fixed-rate investors.
But even the improvement in bonds could not stem the tide of bearish
sentiment in equities. Cyclical issues, linked to the health of the economy,
began to give ground near midday, dropped to nearly 30 points down by
mid-afternoon and then shifted course once again. The Dow components were
nearly evenly divided between winners and losers. Cyclical stocks were
generally weaker. Alcoa fell Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 65, Caterpillar
Dollars 2 to Dollars 108 3/8 and International Paper Dollars 1 7/8 to
Dollars 62 7/8 .
Encouraging earnings reports buoyed other blue chip issues, including
Disney, up Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 41 5/8 and Philip Morris, Dollars 1 5/8
ahead at Dollars 51 5/8 . Union Carbide added Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 25
after releasing its first-quarter results.
But the difficulty in pleasing the high expectations of market was
underlined by Chrysler, which lost Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 48 3/8 , in
spite of posting slightly better-than-expected results. The stock dragged
General Motors down Dollars 2 to Dollars 54 7/8 and Ford Dollars 1 1/2 to
Dollars 56 1/4 .
In telecommunications, Sprint gained Dollars 1 to Dollars 36 on news of a
double-digit increase in operating income. AT&T was Dollars 1 1/4 higher at
Dollars 50 3/4 .
Semiconductors resumed last week's slide. Micron Technologies was down
Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 32 7/8 and Texas Instruments lunged Dollars 3 3/8
to Dollars 66 5/8 .
Among the decliners on the Nasdaq, Intel slipped Dollars 1 to Dollars 57 1/2
and Wellfleet Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 66 1/4 . Canada
Toronto prices continued to fall with the rise of interest rates. The
TSE-300 composite index tumbled 52.99 points, or. 27 per cent, to 4,115.07
compared with a fall of 1.7 per cent on Monday.
The Bank of Canada rate rose 42 basis points to 6.26 per cent today
following the rise in US short-term rates.
Declines swamped advances 656 to 178, volume of 75.26m shares was up
from55.11m, and trading value was CDollars 850.5m compared with CDollars
601.0m.
Mexico
Equities plunged to their lowest close this year on expectations of further
increases in domestic interest rates. The IPC index finished down 72.85
points, or 3.41 per cent, at 2,064.77 points, less than a point above its
session low.
The market's dramatic fall was exacerbated by light volume of 59.6m shares.
More than half the day's turnover reflected trades in heavily-weighted
Telefonos de Mexico, which closed down 3.02 percent in both its A and L
series.
