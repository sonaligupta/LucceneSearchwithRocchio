One of the best catalogues around featuring either precise copies of ancient
objects or modern adaptations of fine collector's pieces. Wonderful things
to give or receive from copies of Sumerian Court jewellery (Pounds 49.95 for
a Cornelian necklace) and The Royal Game of Ur (Pounds 32.95) to masses of
small statues and sculptures such as an Egyptian cat (Pounds 85). There is a
good selection under Pounds 20 - a blue Egyptian cat at Pounds 11.95, a cat
brooch at Pounds 17.95 and a copy of an Egyptian dish, Pounds 12.95.

GTC has always had one of the most attractive Christmas catalogues but
whereas in the past it was primarily seen as a taster for those planning to
visit one of its three shops (at London's Sloane Square, Bath or
Cirencester) this year the company has caught up with white-hot technology:
you can now order 24 hours a day, by phone, fax or post and presents can be
sent anywhere in the world. This year's theme is a Scottish Christmas with
plenty of tartan and old-fashioned nostalgia - reproduction Victorian teddy
bear doorstops, butler's trays (but what about the butler?), hobby horses
and the like.
