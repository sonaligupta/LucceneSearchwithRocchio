FT  21 NOV 92 / Briefcase, Q&A: Write to your MP


OVER THE past four/five years, I have paid about Pounds 500 in extra
accountants' fees due entirely to repeated errors by the Inland Revenue. I
wrote to them recently requesting compensation and was informed that my
request did not fall within their 'statement of practice.' But the errors
and consequent expenses are continuing. Is there anything further I can do?
If you ask your tax office, or your accountants, for a copy of the
Taxpayer's Charter (2nd version, August 1991) you will see that your next
move - under the heading 'If you are not satisfied' - is to write to your MP
and ask him or her to refer your complaint of maladministration to the
parliamentary commissioner (the ombudsman).
