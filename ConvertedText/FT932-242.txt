FT  30 JUN 93 / Gonzalez to woo reluctant Catalans

SPAIN'S parliament yesterday met for the first time since thegeneral
election earlier this month, re-electing the speaker and paving the way for
Mr Felipe Gonzalez to be sworn in for a fourth term as premier.
King Juan Carlos now begins formal consultations with party political
leaders and is expected to inform the speaker next week of his candidate for
prime minister - certain to be Mr Gonzalez.
Mr Gonzalez, whose Socialist party lacks a parliamentary majority, said he
might include the PNV, the small Basque nationalist party, in the government
and that he still hoped to persuade the more reluctant Catalan nationalists
of the larger CiU party to become junior partners in a coalition
administration.
An investiture debate, in which Mr Gonzalez would seek a vote of confidence,
could be held as early as Thursday next week and the new government
announced shortly after.
The need for a broad-based government has been heightened by a back-bench
revolt among Socialist MPs against Mr Gonzalez' nomination of Mr Carlos
Solchaga as the party's parliamentary leader.
Mr Solchaga, widely distrusted by the party's left wing and the unions,
secured the nomination by 87 votes to 66 with six abstentions. Spokesmen for
the rebel group said, however, they would respect the majority decision and
pledged loyalty to Mr Solchaga.
The Catalan politicians are understood to be under considerable pressure
from Barcelona business leaders to overturn their refusal to back Mr
Gonzalez. CiU support would ensure a stable government and its
business-orientated policies would reassure the markets.
