FT  24 NOV 92 / International Company News: Air France FFr2.7bn in the red

   PARIS


AIR FRANCE, the French state-owned airline, yesterday disclosed a
bigger-than-expected net loss of FFr2.7bn (Dollars 500m) for the first nine
months of 1992 amid stormy scenes in Paris as employees demonstrated against
job cuts.
The board also yesterday gave final approval to the proposed merger between
Air France and UTA, another French airline. The merger, following which the
UTA businesses will represent two-fifths of the new group, will take effect
from December 29.
The merger has triggered a cost-cutting drive at Air France involving the
loss of 1,500 jobs. The group's employees yesterday staged strikes and
stoppages in protest against the cuts, resulting in the cancellation of some
flights.
More than 2,500 demonstrated outside the group's headquarters, chanting
slogans against Mr Jacques Attali, its chairman, and Mr Jean-Louis Bianco,
France's transport minister.
Air France, which, like other international airlines, has been affected by
the economic slowdown, had originally anticipated net losses of FFr2.5bn for
the first nine months of this year. The outcome was slightly worse than
expected, prompting the board to forecast overall losses of FFr4bn for the
full year, with consolidated losses of FFr3bn on sales of FFr57bn.
