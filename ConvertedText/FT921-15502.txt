FT  09 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Secondary stocks perform
strongly as Dow held back


   By PATRICK HARVERSON


   NEW YORK


Wall Street
SECONDARY stocks were again the star performers in US equity markets
yesterday, shrugging off news of President Bush's illness to end at another
all-time high. Broader indices, however, ended the day virtually unchanged,
writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down a slight 0.89 at
3,203.94 from Tuesday's record peak. The more broadly based Standard &
Poor's 500 was just 0.70 firmer at 418.10, while the Nasdaq composite of
over-the-counter stocks outshone the other indices by climbing 8.03 to a
record 610.32. Turnover on the New York SE was exceptionally heavy at 290m
shares.
The market opened weaker, with the Dow retreating 17 points as investors
reacted nervously to the news that President Bush had collapsed at a dinner
in Tokyo. Assurances from Mr Bush's doctors that he was only suffering from
intestinal flu calmed the market, and it did not take long for demand to
pick up and prices to recover.
Although there was a bout of mid-afternoon selling, there was enough late
buying to recover most of the losses. CSX gained Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 56
1/8 after the railroad and pipeline group announced a restructuring
programme which would involve substantial job cuts and, hopefully, big
improvements in productivity stemming from agreements with the rail unions.
The company said it would be taking a Dollars 490m after-tax charge in the
fourth quarter to cover the cost of the restructuring.
RJR Nabisco, up Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 11 1/2 in turnover of 9.3m shares,
was in great demand yesterday. Investors bought the stock on hopes that the
company's earnings will improve sharply this year as the economy picks up.
Tandem Computers moved ahead Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 13 in heavy trading
after the company said that first-quarter 1992 revenues would be above those
reported a year ago, and announced plans for a restructuring charge in the
next quarter of Dollars 90m. In the same sector, IBM declined Dollars 2 1/4
to Dollars 92 3/8 , Compaq shed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 33 1/8 and Digital
Equipment slipped Dollars 3/4 to Dollars 59 3/4 .
Best Buy jumped Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 20 1/4 in response to news that the
electronic appliance retailer's same-store sales increased by 16 per cent in
December.
Leading the strong performance of over-the-counter stocks were Microsoft, up
Dollars 4 1/4 at Dollars 124 1/4 , Apple, Dollars 1 3/8 ahead at Dollars 60
1/2 , and Amgen, which appreciated Dollars 1 to Dollars 74 5/8 .
Mentor put on Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 12 3/4 after the company offered its
saline-filled breast implants as an alternative to the silicone-based
variety, which have been banned from use for 45 days by the US Food and Drug
Administration pending further safety tests.
Canada
TORONTO closed little changed in heavy trading after rallying from an early
decline.
The composite index gained just 2.7 at 3,515.6 on the day. It opened down
almost 13 points, following the drop overnight on the Tokyo market, but
steadily recovered. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by 321 to 259
after a volume of 36.4m shares.
Biomira gained CDollars  7/8 to CDollars 18 1/2 , on top of the previous
day's rise of CDollars 2 7/8 . The company said it has agreed in principle
with a 'major pharmaceutical company' to enter into joint licence and
research agreements.
