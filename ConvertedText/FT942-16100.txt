   By DANIEL GREEN


Imperial Chemical Industries is spending about Dollars 10m (Pounds 6.8m)
expanding its US paints operation.
Through Glidden, its paints offshoot based in Cleveland, Ohio, it is buying
California-based Decratrend from a subsidiary of Total, the French
petrochemical group.
The purchase is part of Glidden's plans to expand outside its traditional
home of the north-eastern US.
