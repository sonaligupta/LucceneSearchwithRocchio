FT  30 OCT 93 / Auditors told to inform on fraudsters


   By ANDREW JACK


AUDITORS MUST examine companies' accounts so as to have 'a reasonable
expectation' of finding any fraudulent statements, under draft guidelines
issued by the Auditing Practices Board yesterday.
When they detect extreme cases of fraud they should notify the authorities
without informing the company, according to the standards-setting body.
The drafting of SAS 110, the auditing standard on fraud and error, has been
based on a proposed international standard on auditing published in July.
The standard appears to place a relatively low burden on the auditor in
detecting fraud, stressing that auditors are entitled to accept
representations as truthful and documents as genuine unless the audit
reveals evidence to the contrary.
But it stresses that auditors cannot assume that an instance of fraud or
error is an isolated occurance unless circumstances clearly indicate
otherwise.
It says auditors should have higher standards of fraud and error detection
for government entities.
The standard says auditors should qualify the accounts if necessary without
regard to the consequences and even if corrections have been made since the
balance sheet was signed.
It says if auditors can no longer have confidence in the integrity of
directors and they believe a fraud is contrary to the public interest, they
should report matters to the relevant authorities.
The draft has been circulated for public comments by 28 February 1994.
