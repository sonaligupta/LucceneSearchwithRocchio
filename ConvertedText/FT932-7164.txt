FT  25 MAY 93 / International Company News: Pre-flotation boost for
Argentine oil group


   By JOHN BARHAM


   BUENOS AIRES


ARGENTINA'S state-owned oil company, YPF, reported a 123 per cent increase
in operating profits to Dollars 390m in 1992, despite a 7 per cent decline
in sales revenues to Dollars 3.91bn, according to a provisional prospectus
leaked to a Buenos Aires newspaper yesterday.
The government, which owns 100 per cent of YPF, plans to sell up to 70 per
cent of the company in a local and international share flotation scheduled
for July 2.
The flotation is expected to raise Dollars 2.5bn, making it one of the
biggest privatisations yet in Latin America and among the largest in the
world this year.
However, the government has restricted data on the company's financial
performance pending approval of its application for listing in the US.
Government officials confirmed the data, published in a special eight-page
supplement in Ambito Financiero, a business daily, was largely correct, but
warned final figures for 1992 were likely to be slightly different due to
revisions to fourth-quarter figures. The final version of the prospectus
will also contain financial information on the first quarter of 1993.
The fall in sales and a 9 per cent decline in assets to Dollars 7.42bn
reflect the government's policy of selling off non-core YPF businesses in
the run up to privatisation.
