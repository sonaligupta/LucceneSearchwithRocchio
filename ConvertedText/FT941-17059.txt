FT  06 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Granada/LWT


The failure of the 'quartet' of television companies to make music together
severely impairs LWT's defence strategy. It may also expose Anglia to a bid
and leaves Yorkshire-Tyne Tees' shares looking horribly overvalued. LWT will
now have to rely on its defence that television companies will be re-rated
as industry regulation is relaxed. But rival bidders may already be running
scared of the prices being slapped on the table. Besides, budding media
conglomerates are more likely to want programme copyrights than the right to
run TV franchises.
Granada may try to despatch LWT quickly by pitching in with a higher cash
offer. But it has some fine calculations to make if it does sweeten its
terms. It will prove hard enough to generate sufficient cost savings to
avoid earnings dilution at the bid's current level. A higher offer would
only make the butchery more savage. While Channel 3 franchises may continue
to command scarcity value, they face fairly dull trading prospects.
Intensifying competition threatens to sap the strength of the advertising
upturn. Channel 4 is proving adept at grabbing a bigger slice of the
advertising cake while cable and satellite operators are nibbling away
furiously, too.
