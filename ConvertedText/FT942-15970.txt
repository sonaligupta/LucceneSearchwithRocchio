FT  13 APR 94 / Better deal for consumers

The Japanese government yesterday endorsed a product liability bill,
offering consumers improved protection against defective products. The move
follows nearly 20 years of debate.
Ms Manae Kubota, director general of the Economic Planning Agency, hailed
the bill as marking 'a big turning point' for consumers and 'the biggest
reform effort for upgrading people's livelihood' under the current cabinet.
However, the bill has been criticised by lawyers and consumer groups as
inadequate.
Under the bill companies are only liable for 10 years after the products are
sold.
Companies are also exempted if they can show that the defect could not have
been foreseen even with up-to-date technology at the time of sale.
The bill, which is being introduced in parliament, could be implemented by
the middle of 1995.
