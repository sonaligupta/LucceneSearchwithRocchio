FT  12 APR 94 / International Company News: France starts pre-placement of
UAP shares

The French government will today start the next phase of its privatisation
programme by beginning the pre-placement, or marketing, of shares in Union
des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the insurance group.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, yesterday said that the price of
the issue would be announced within the next few weeks, with the timing of
the share sale being determined by market conditions.
The issue involves the sale of the state's 50 per cent holding in UAP, which
is valued at more than FFr25bn (Dollars 4bn), and a capital increase for the
company.
However, institutional investors can from today place uncommitted orders for
shares in UAP, France's biggest insurer. The group's employees will also be
allowed to reserve shares.
The economy ministry has already announced that it plans to allocate more
than 11 per cent of the shares to noyaux durs, or 'hard core' shareholders.
