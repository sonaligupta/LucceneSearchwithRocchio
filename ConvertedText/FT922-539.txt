FT  26 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Oil sector braced for selling


   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and COLIN MILLHAM


OIL SHARE dealers are bracing themselves for a barrage of selling today
following the dramatic resignation after market hours last night of Mr
Robert Horton, chairman and chief executive of British Petroleum.
The chairman's resignation was interpreted by the stock market as a signal
that BP will halve its quarterly dividend from 4.2p to 2.1p when its
second-quarter figures are announced on July 30. Mr Horton has been regarded
as the standard bearer for BP's dividend in the face of the oil company's
huge debt burden and falling profits.
London's closing price for BP of 243p, up 5, was struck before news of Mr
Horton's resignation. In early trading on Wall Street, BP shares plummeted
to around 205p-215p in the wake of the resignation announcement. London
traders fear that BP stock could open at 210p in London this morning. The
oil group, once the UK's biggest company by market capitalisation, has been
relegated to fourth spot.
Analysts believe that the dividend will be cut when the second-quarter
numbers are published. Mr John Toalster, oil specialist at Strauss Turnbull,
said: 'We expected the dividend to be cut by a third in the third quarter
but this news means it will almost certainly be halved in July.'
Burton downgrade
Profit-taking combined with a broker's downgrade left Burton Group 2 1/2 off
at 46 1/2 p after active trading of 5.4m. The shares have risen 16 per cent
in the last three months, and some in the market decided they looked
expensive and took profits.
Securities house Nomura snipped its profits forecast for the next two
trading years, analyst Mr Andy Hughes arguing that Burton's recent good
performance has been based on recovery hopes, but that sales growth in June
has not been as strong as in April and May.
He suspects that the company's debt burden may now be larger than expected,
and is looking for profits of Pounds 17.5m in 1992/93, down Pounds 7.5m, and
for Pounds 35m, against Pounds 47.5m, the year after.
Tesco reaction
Supermarket groups underperformed the market, partly as a result of
analysts' disappointment with a presentation by Tesco on Wednesday, and also
after an overnight programme trade from the US, reported to include UK
stores and food retailers.
Tesco lost 3 to 278p on good turnover of 3.9m shares, as analysts reacted to
the company's presentation by saying that it might be all very well to talk
about cost savings ranging from Pounds 75m to Pounds 120m between now and
1995, through changes in store designs, but why were there no sales figures
for the first quarter?
Mr Jeremy Alun-Jones at Lehman Brothers described the presentation as 'cagey
on current sales', leaving analysts doubting how good the figures are.
It was also pointed out that inflation across Tesco's product range has
fallen to 2 1/2 per cent, apparently held down by low seasonal food prices,
meaning there may be less money than expected passing through the check-out
tills.
The long drawn out battle for control of Midland Bank came to an end with
the news that Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's bid for the bank
had been declared unconditional. HSBC said it had acceptances for around 64
per cent of the Midland equity.
The HSBC bid has been given a very substantial boost by the strong
performance of the Hong Kong market, which helped HSBC shares to rise
sharply. Midland ended the day 22 higher at 452p.
A series of analysts' upgrades caused Whitbread 'A' to jump 21 to 432p,
although turnover was little more than average at 1.8m shares. Brewing
analysts at Cazenove, the company's broker, Nomura, Strauss Turnbull and SG
Warburg Securities revised their profits forecasts upwards following a
presentation by the company.
Mr Derek Brock at Nomura raised his forecast for the current year by Pounds
5m to Pounds 275m.
After being dogged by recent bad news, the holiday sector was provided with
some relief by Airbreak, the USM-quoted tour group. It announced that sales
for the first five months of 1992 were up 75 per cent and average prices
31.5 per cent. Perhaps more importantly, the group said there was little
discounting, the subject which had been undermining the sector's performance
in recent days. Airbreak rose 6 1/2 to 49p, with Airtours rallying 7 to 260p
and Owners Abroad 2 1/2 to 76p.
British Aerospace shrugged off the recent gloom and moved sharply forward on
talk that GEC was taking more than a passing interest.
BAe shares jumped 22 to 272p, although several analysts dismissed the talk
and instead attributed the day's move to bargain hunting. Turnover reached
2.2m. BAe was also busy in traded options, where some 2,149 contracts were
dealt, the equivalent to about 2m shares. GEC edged forward 2 to 228p.
The start-up for the Globex after-hours screen trading service provided a
boost for Reuters shares, which forged ahead 27 to 1130p in thin volume.
The big losses and the sale of the banking and leasing businesses left Brown
Shipley 35 weaker at 80p. Other merchant banking issues were still
restrained by worries that the Isosceles debt refinancing programme has run
into problems.
Other banks performed strongly, with Barclays boosted by a Robert Fleming
buy note. TSB's figures were given a gloomy reception, the stock closing 2
off at 132p.
Tobacco shares, depressed on Wednesday by a US Supreme Court ruling,
recovered as observers suggested that the court decision was not as bad for
the companies as at first appeared likely. BAT Industries strengthened 18 to
751p in solid volume of 5.1m shares. Rothmans 'B' appreciated 24 to 1115p
after announcing a 4.2 per cent rise in annual profits and proposing a
two-for-one share split.
The maintained dividend and an expression of confidence that the
debilitating price war in the plasterboard market has been brought to an end
prompted a flurry of support for BPB shares, which closed 10 ahead at 175p,
after 177p.
P & O bucked the market trend to end 9 cheaper at 464p after broker
Charterhouse Tilney downgraded current year profits expectations.
The market reacted coolly to the detailing of Wellcome's proposed share
flotation, mainly because many of the key elements had been well leaked in
advance. The shares initially shot forward, but retreated in a quiet
pharmaceuticals sector, eventually settling just a penny to the good at
914p.
