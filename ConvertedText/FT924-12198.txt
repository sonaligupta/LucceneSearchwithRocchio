   BANGKOK


new government is committed to liberal trade based on a free market system
and will further loosen control on money and capital markets, Prime Minister
Chuan Leekpai told parliament yesterday, Reuter reports from Bangkok.
'The government will carry out a policy of liberal economy by using market
mechanism and doing away with monopoly and unfair competition', Mr Chuan
said in his first policy statement.
His coalition would create 'discipline and stability in the monetary and
budgetary system of the country by controlling the inflation rate at a low
level and being careful in the government and private-sector spending,' he
said.
Mr Chuan's Democrat Party won the most seats in the September 13 general
election and now leads a five-party coalition controlling 207 seats in the
360-member House of Representatives.
