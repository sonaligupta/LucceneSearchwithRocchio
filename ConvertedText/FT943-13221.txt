FT  20 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Argyll surprises dealers


   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO


A chink of light appeared in the gloomy food retailing sector yesterday as
Argyll Group surprised the market with an upbeat trading statement.
Increasing sales and improving margins came in ahead of analysts' best
expecta-tions and prompted a raft of profits upgrades, together with several
swift buy recommendations.
Marketmakers, who had anticipated another cautionary tale of difficult
trading, were caught short of stock and scrambled to buy. The shares shot
forward to end a busy session 12 1/2 ahead at 251p with a hefty 19m traded.
However, the initial technical situation did not prevent the more wilder
speculation seeping into the market, with one suggestion that J. Sainsbury
might be tempted into a bid for Argyll, attracted by the strong position of
its Safeway chain in Scotland.
This was dismissed by specialists, who suggested that the persistent rumour
of a stalking Hanson was more feasible, though still unlikely.
Meanwhile, William Low shares continued to hold firm as the market awaited
Sainsbury's response to last week's Pounds 154m friendly bid by Tesco.
Sainsbury is currently studying information supplied by the Scottish
supermarket group before making a decision. However, some analysts believe
Sainsbury's real strategic ambitions lie in the US, with rumours of an
imminent Pounds 1bn deal to buy an eastern seaboard retailer to complement
its Boston-based Shaws food business.
Even if Sainsbury does not enter a bidding war for Low, most in the market
believe a third party will, with Kwik Save shareholder Dairy Farm, of Hong
Kong, and Rewe, of Germany, among the names being mooted. Sainsbury ended 2
1/2 up at 400p, Kwik Save 9 ahead at 537p, and with no change at both Tesco
at 238 1/2 p, and Low at 256p.
