FT  29 OCT 93 / International Company News: Argentina rejects call to help
Aerolneas


   By JOHN BARHAM


   BUENOS AIRES


ARGENTINA has rejected demands by Iberia, Spain's national airline, that it
inject Dollars 215m into loss-making Aerolneas Argentinas, the privatised
carrier operated by Iberia.
Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, said: 'The state will not make any
capital contribution to Aerolneas.' He told Iberia it should seek the
Dollars 500m in fresh capital it needs from Aerolneas's private
shareholders. Argentina's government still owns one third of Aerolneas.
The company lost over Dollars 200m in the financial year ending in June,
against Dollars 80m in 1992, contributing heavily to Iberia's severe losses
this year. Aerolneas said it needed new funds to make good losses and
finance acquisition of new aircraft, as required under its November 1990
privatisation contract.
However, Argentina's transport department said yesterday that 'if the
company has financial problems it should go bankrupt like any other
company'.
It added that if Aerolneas failed to comply with its privatisation contract,
the government would call in bank guarantees backing the investment plan.
Iberia owns 30 per cent of Aerolneas and the Argentine government 33 per
cent. Minority shareholders include two Spanish banks and several small
local investors. Employees own 10 per cent of the company, although this
stake is held in trust by the government.
The confrontation between Iberia and Mr Cavallo is the latest in a long
battle over Aerolneas that began with its privatisation three years ago,
when the Iberia-led consortium paid Dollars 1.87bn in a cash and debt for
equity swap for 85 per cent of the airline.
