FT  01 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Sales dip weakens Argyll


   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN


Food retailer Argyll Group tumbled 17 to 255p, the day's biggest Footsie
retreat, after a disappointing statement confirmed fears that the group was
losing market share.
A hefty 16m shares were dealt, marking Argyll's busiest day for around five
months. Traders also said a large overhanging line of stock had depressed
the shares further.
The group's interim profits were up by Pounds 8m to just below the market
consensus of Pounds 206.8m. But the statement on current trading, indicating
that same store sales at Argyll's Safeway chain had fallen 0.8 per cent in
the first six weeks of the year, was the particular disappointment. Analysts
were also disappointed by the lack of more detailed information on the
review of the business started 18 months ago.
SG Warburg was said to have been one of the brokers downgrading full-year
profits expectations, with rivals of the house suggesting it had reduced its
forecast by around Pounds 10m to Pounds 390m. Analyst Mr Neil Currie was not
prepared to confirm the figures but said: 'The current trading situation is
not good and has to be addressed. In the meantime, some of the reasons to be
bullish about Argyll are postponed rather than eliminated.'
