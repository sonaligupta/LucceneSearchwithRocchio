FT  11 JAN 92 / Finance & The Family: Insurers' bonus gloom


   By JOHN AUTHERS


THE JANUARY round of bonus declarations by life insurers has produced some
unpleasant news for investors.
The trend is uneven, but bonuses and pay-outs on with-profits pension and
endowment policies, particularly over ten years, are heading down.
Two reasons are given:
The stock market had a bad year in 1990, and
Many analysts are predicting lower yields for the coming decade. If this is
right, bonuses must come down now, or offices will have difficulty meeting
their commitments in future.
Comparisons between bonuses are unwise, as the structure of reversionary
bonuses, which are awarded annually and cannot be taken away, and terminal
bonuses, awarded when the policy matures, varies from office to office. It
is better to make a straight comparison of final pay-outs made.
The standard industry practice is to quote pay-outs for endowments started
by men aged 29, and paying monthly premiums of Pounds 30.
Norwich Union set the tone last month by announcing it had lopped 9 per cent
off 10-year pay-outs, to Pounds 7,532, and 5 per cent off 25-year pay-outs,
to Pounds 60,073. Others followed suit.
Yesterday, Commercial Union bucked the trend. It cut its reversionary bonus,
but the pay-out on 25-year policies increased 6.3 per cent to Pounds 65,596.
This is the highest so far, and may well remain so. On ten-year policies,
which do not include the strong growth of the late 1970s, CU cut its pay-out
from Pounds 7,645 to Pounds 7,484.
CU attributed its success to the conservative strategy of paying out large
reversionary bonuses. This makes its policies more secure.
Lower reversionary bonuses give investment managers more freedom to take
advantage of big gains in the stock market but mean that final pay-outs can
be over-reliant on terminal bonuses.
The higher the stress on terminal bonuses, the narrower the difference
between 'with-profits' policies and straightforward unit-linked policies.
Last year, terminal bonus accounted for only 29.8 per cent of CU's 25-year
pay-out (compared with 63.0 per cent for Standard Life, last year's top
performer). CU looks like a good haven for the nervous.
Guardian Royal Exchange, which finished bottom in last year's Money
Management magazine survey of 10-year pay-outs, has cut its final pay-out on
a 25-year endowment policy by 4.9 per cent compared with January last year,
while for a 10-year policy the reduction is 7 per cent. Using the standard
assumptions, a 10-year endowment would now pay Pounds 5,479, on total
premiums of Pounds 3,600.
Last year, GRE's 10-year pay-out of Pounds 5,887 was Pounds 641 lower than
the next-worst pay-out of the 49 offices surveyed, and it has cut pay-outs
on 10-year endowments every year since 1986, when a similar policy would
have paid out Pounds 7,196. Past performance, is no guide to future returns,
but it is hard to imagine many independent brokers recommending GRE 10-year
policies.
Michael Auld, of GRE, points out that GRE's 25-year performance is more
competitive, and adds: 'I think there's a move in the market by one means or
another to reward to those who have contributed to the life fund for the
longest time.'
