FT  30 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Lumber prices depressed

PROTECTING THE forest habitat of the the spotted owl supposedly drove North
American lumber prices through the roof early this year as fears of wood
shortages were raised.
The spotted owl controversy is still rife, but lumber prices have collapsed.
The cost of 1,000 board-feet of Canadian spruce dropped from Dollars 475 in
mid-March to Dollars 235 in early June, according to Madison's Canadian
Lumber Reporter.
Traders explain that improved weather in the Pacific north-west has aided
logging, while a slower-than-expected US economic recovery has dulled demand
for houses, and hence for wood.
The US Commerce Department yesterday reported that May home sales fell 21
per cent to an annualised rate of 571,000 units, the largest decline in 12
years. Chicago lumber futures dropped on the news, with the July delivery
price down Dollars 3.80 at Dollars 234.70 per 1,000 board-feet.
