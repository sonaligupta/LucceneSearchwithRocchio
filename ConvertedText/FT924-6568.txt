CAMPBELL SOUP, the US food company embroiled in a takeover bid for Arnotts,
the Australian cookie and cracker group, yesterday reported a 21 per cent
increase in first-quarter after-tax profits to Dollars 156.6m.
The improvement was scored on sales up 10 per cent to Dollars 1.7bn, and
translated into earnings per share of 62 cents, compared with 51 cents a
year earlier.
Mr David Johnson, Campbell's chief executive, claimed the advance reflected
a push for markets and increased market shares, with advertising expenditure
up 24 per cent.
In its core North and South America markets, Campbell saw a 9 per cent sales
increase, with a 15 per cent earnings gain. In the much smaller Europe/Asia
division, the gains were 16 per cent and 28 per cent respectively.
However, although sales in the biscuit and bakery arm advanced by 8 per
cent, profits fell by 11 per cent.
Campbell said sales of its Pepperidge Farm premium cookies remained soft,
because of the recession, and that the earnings dip reflected higher
marketing spending on new Pepperidge Farm and Delacre products.
