FT  07 JAN 94 / Sluggishness in European mainland markets


   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY


Continued sluggishness in European mainland markets has caused
'disappointing' export business, members of the Confederation of British
Industry in Yorkshire and Humberside said yesterday, Ian Hamilton Fazey
writes.
The CBI's regional council added that economic recovery was under way, but
slowly, with only gradual improvement in home orders to compensate for
export difficulties. Asia-Pacific markets were also reported to be less
buoyant than a few months ago.
Mr Peter Lee, the chairman, said: 'The construction industry is still short
of work and margins in this, as well as many other sectors, are under severe
pressure.
'Many manufacturers are still finding life difficult. More companies are
reducing workforce numbers than increasing them.'
