FT  09 JUN 92 / Israel allows limited travel from Gaza


   By HUGH CARNEGY

THE Israeli authorities yesterday allowed Palestinians from the occupied
Gaza Strip to go to work in Israel for the first time in 15 days, but
introduced tough new measures to cut down sharply on the number eligible to
do so.
Only a few thousand workers will initially qualify to cross into Israel
under the amended regulations compared with the 30,000 to 40,000 who did so
before the closure. Yesterday, only a few hundred had the necessary permits.
Employment in Israel, chiefly in the construction industry, is the main
source of income for the 750,000 inhabitants of the impoverished strip.
Israel sealed it off following the fatal stabbing by an unemployed Gazan of
an Israeli schoolgirl near Tel Aviv on May 24, despite army concerns that
the move would fuel further violent unrest in the territory.
Those allowed entry will be restricted to people over 28 years of age
employed in places where at least 10 Gazans work together.
Their Israeli employers will be required to collect them from exit
checkpoints - Gaza is fenced - and deliver them back after work.
They will have to carry a special red permit, in addition to at least three
sets of written permits already required to work in Israel.
Mr Hanan Rubin, spokesman for the Civil Administration, the military
government in Gaza and the West Bank, said it was intended to increase the
numbers allowed back into Israel over time, according to the situation.
However, Mr Rubin said the red permit and the requirement for all workers to
be collected and returned by their employers would be permanent measures.
He said it was also possible that the lower age limit of 28 would remain
permanently in force.
The Gaza Strip has been the most militant area against Israeli rule.
