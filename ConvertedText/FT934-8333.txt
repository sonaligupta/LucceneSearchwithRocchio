FT  16 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Queens Moat shareholders establish fighting
fund


   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent


A GROUP of Queens Moat Houses shareholders has set up a fighting fund and
nominated three representatives to argue on their behalf at the annual
meeting on November 29.
The three are Mr Anthony Beaumont-Dark, the former Conservative MP, Mr Denis
Woodhams, who ran a Queens Moat hotel in Stratford-upon-Avon, and Mr Peter
Bruton-Phillips, a solicitor.
The QMH Shareholders' Action Group is urging supporters to fill in proxy
forms for the meeting in favour of one or more of the three.
The group is asking shareholders to contribute 2p a share to a fighting
fund. It said it needed to take the advice of senior lawyers, property
valuation experts and accountants to ensure that shareholders' interests
were not overlooked in any restructuring.
It was particularly concerned that any debt for equity swap would dilute
shareholders' interests to an unacceptable level.
Although it recognised the importance of retaining the goodwill of creditor
banks, the group claimed insufficient attention was being paid to
shareholders' interests.
The group said yesterday that the initial response to the fighting fund
proposal had been positive. It added that it was taking legal advice on the
rights of shareholders.
The group is considering putting Mr Beaumont-Dark forward as a non-executive
director. Mr Beaumont-Dark said yesterday: 'The banks, and one understands
it, are protecting their own situation. But people feel other interests
ought to be looked to as well.'
He added: 'The banks have a certain responsibility. How well did they check
before lending money? They're not just innocent victims. The people who are
the most innocent are the shareholders.'
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, last week appointed
inspectors to investigate the group, which is talking to creditor banks
about refinancing its Pounds 1.18bn debt.
