FT  26 MAY 93 / International Company News: Sales down 5% at Sumitomo
Electric


   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO


SUMITOMO Electric, Japan's largest manufacturer of wires and cables,
yesterday posted a 15 per cent drop in parent pre-tax profits to Y30.4bn
(Dollars 276.36m) for the year to March from Y35.9bn the year before, on a
downturn in Japanese capital spending.
Sumitomo, which supplies wires and cables to NTT, as well as power companies
and automobile manufacturers, also reported a 5 per cent fall in sales to
Y761.2bn.
Sales for the year to March 1994 are forecast at Y760bn with pre-tax profits
at Y31bn, as the benefits of cost-cutting measures show through.
