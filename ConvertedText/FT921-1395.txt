FT  24 MAR 92 / County Hall sale can be reversed


   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent


A JAPANESE company's deal to buy the main building at County Hall, former
headquarters of the Greater London Council, can be terminated up to the end
of the year by the London Residuary Body. The body is responsible for
selling the assets of the GLC, which was abolished in 1986.
The contract for the sale, at an undisclosed price, to the privately owned
Shirayama Corporation, was signed in Osaka yesterday by Sir Godfrey Taylor,
chairman of the residuary body. The deal is not due to be concluded before
October next year.
The outcome of the general election will decide whether the building is used
as a hotel and leisure centre, as envisaged by Shirayama, or shared between
a new Greater London Authority and the London School of Economics, as
proposed by the Labour party. Labour has said it would reverse the sale to
Shirayama.
