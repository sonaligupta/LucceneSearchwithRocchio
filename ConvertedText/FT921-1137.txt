FT  25 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: German lesson for Europe


It is perplexing that German bond yields should suddenly be back over 8 per
cent. There was never any doubt that money supply growth - 8.5 per cent in
February - would be slow to return to its target range or that inflation
would be pushing up towards 5 per cent this month. Perhaps investors feared
the Bundesbank would tighten further after Friday's 9 per cent settlement
for heating workers. But Bonn is taking a tough line on public sector pay
and it would be uncharacteristic for the central bank to react to each twist
in the round. The simple explanation seems to be the market has finally
given up hope of lower money rates in the foreseeable future.
The prospect that the yield curve will remain sharply inverted thus adds to
the attraction of cash. German bankers report customer time deposits are
growing sharply. Curiously, though, money leaving the German bond market
does not seem to be seeking higher long-term returns elsewhere in Europe.
The yield curve is inverted elsewhere, of course, while the UK and French
markets have political worries of their own. But even in Denmark, where
inflation is only 2.3 per cent, the spread over German bond yields has
widened by some 30 basis points this year. That suggests deeper doubts over
currency union and yield convergence. If the Bundesbank really is determined
to stay the course, some of its partners may eventually decide they have no
choice but to realign.
