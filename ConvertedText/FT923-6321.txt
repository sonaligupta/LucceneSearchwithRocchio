FT  25 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Underwriters take bulk of Birkby rights


BIRKBY'S fully underwritten Pounds 6m rights issue has been completed with
valid acceptances being received in respect of 1.02m shares, or 15.2 per
cent.
This included 1m shares for which Birkby, until June a private company into
which Finlan Group reversed, had received from Finlan shareholders. Some
5.71m shares will be allocated to the sub-underwriters.
Finlan was a property and building materials group. Birkby is a rental group
providing managed workspace, vehicle hire and instalment credit to small
businesses in the M62 corridor.
Mr William Cran, chief executive, said the rights proceeds would eliminate
group borrowings, including Finlan's Pounds 425,000 debt to FennoScandia
Bank, and provide working capital.
