FT  23 JUL 94 / International Company News: Canal Plus, Bertelsmann in
pay-TV joint venture

   PARIS, BERLIN


Canal Plus, the French television company, and Bertelsmann, the German
publishing group, are to set up a joint venture aimed at tapping pay
television services throughout Europe.
The companies, which will invest more than DM700m (Dollars 446.9m) over the
next three years, will also specialise in digital technology, and create a
joint fund to buy programme and movie rights.
Canal Plus had a turnover of FFr8.7bn (Dollars 1.62bn) last year, and
Bertelsmann, one of Germany's largest private investors in television, had a
turnover of DM17bn.
The decision by Canal Plus to join forces with Bertelsmann comes at a
difficult time for the French company. It was rocked earlier this year by
the sudden resignation of Mr Andre Rousselet, its founder and chairman,
following a row with Havas, the French media group and one of its main
shareholders.
Mr Rousselet resigned after discovering that Havas had formed a coterie of
Canal Plus shareholders to effectively control the company.
He claimed it was a covert attempt to prevent Canal Plus from operating as
an independent entity.
This, he said, was because Canal Plus had been negotiating in the European
multimedia field with foreign partners such as Bertelsmann, in preference to
France Telecom, the state-controlled tele-communications group allied to
Havas.
Saint-Louis, the French sugar, paper and food group, is negotiating the
acquisition of an additional stake in Spanish sugar group General Azucarera,
Reuter reports from Paris.
Azucarera has annual sales of FFr1.5bn and is 10 per cent owned by Saint
Louis.
Saint Louis is under-stood to be seeking to acquire an additional 10 to 15
per cent of the Spanish group.
