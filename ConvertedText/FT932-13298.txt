FT  23 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: ICI consolidates


   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE


The rise in ICI shares continued yesterday as the stock was marked higher in
early trading following an overnight gain in the US. The stock was the best
performer in percentage terms among the top 100 FT-SE Index companies,
climbing 52 to 1288p on unusually heavy turnover of 7.7m. The shares were
helped by news from ICI's bioscience arm Zeneca that first-quarter results
were better than a year ago.
Transatlantic dealers in London said a recent recommendation from US
brokerage PaineWebber was still driving the shares, and another US house,
Morgan Stanley, had joined Goldman Sachs and PaineWebber on the bid.
However, they added that sellers were beginning to appear in London as the
stock hit the 1280p level.
