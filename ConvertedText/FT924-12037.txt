FT  22 OCT 92 / Major's popularity ratings low


   By IVO DAWNAY


THE fiercely hostile reaction to the government's pit closure plan and
deepening public concern over the economy have had a devastating impact on
Mr John Major's popularity ratings, according to a new opinion poll, Ivo
Dawnay writes.
The Mori survey, published in The European today, found 77 per cent
dissatisfied with the prime minister and only 16 per cent expressing
confidence in his leadership - the lowest rating ever recorded for a British
head of government.
At her lowest level in March 1990, Mrs Margaret (now Lady) Thatcher recorded
a 20 per cent satisfaction rating.
The findings, taken from a sample of 1,082 drawn from across Britain, said
some 46 per cent of those questioned wanted him to resign, a 17-point rise
over the past three weeks. However, 45 per cent countered that he should
stay at his post.
