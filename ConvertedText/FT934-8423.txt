FT  16 NOV 93 / Lucas workers reject pay offers


   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor


PAY RISES of between 1 per cent and 1.5 per cent have been rejected at
several plants of Lucas Industries, the automotive and aerospace components
company, and ballots on industrial action are being carried out at four
plants in Birmingham.
About half of the 35 Lucas plants have, however, settled for rises of
between zero and 2 per cent.
The AEEU craft union in Birmingham says that there is a centrally determined
pay band even though the company changed to plant-level pay bargaining
several years ago. The company denies that it has a pay norm.
Meanwhile, members of the TGWU general union at Vauxhall's Ellesmere Port
plant will start an overtime ban from Thursday, having rejected a pay offer
of 2.5 per cent this year followed by a 3 per cent rise and a 1 per cent
cash bonus next year.
