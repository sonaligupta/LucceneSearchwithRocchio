FT  27 SEP 94 / Saudis confirm dissident arrests


   By REUTER


   DUBAI


Saudi Arabia announced last night that the authorities were holding 110
people in connection with 'attempts to sow dissension and cause chaos',
Reuter reports from Dubai.
An interior ministry statement carried by the official Saudi Press Agency
was the kingdom's first confirmation that opponents of the government had
been arrested.
A London-based opposition group alleged a week ago that more than 1,000
followers of a Moslem sheikh had been rounded up after demonstrations
against his arrest.
'The total of those detained is 110 people. The release of some will be
considered once investigations now under way with them are complete,' the
statement said. 'The cases of those who played a leading role will be
considered after the completion of investigations into plans to cause
chaos,' the statement added.
