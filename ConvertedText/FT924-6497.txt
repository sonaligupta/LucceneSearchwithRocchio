FT  20 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei rises for second
day as volume improves

TWO-WAY trade supported activity as the Nikkei average rose moderately to
post its second consecutive gain, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei closed 92.47 higher at 16,871.31 after a high of 17,007.82 and a
low of 16,801.81. The high was registered in the morning on buying by public
pension funds and dealers, but share prices lost momentum as profit-taking
and position-squaring eroded some of the initial gains.
Volume remained firm at 320m shares against 347m. Advances led declines by
609 to 382 with 142 unchanged, the Topix index of all first section stocks
rose 3.32 to 1,274.53 but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 7.47 to
1,016.84.
Index-linked buying and arbitrage-related trading also drove up share
prices, while companies took profits on tokkin, or specified money trusts.
Traders said that buy orders placed at lower levels by public funds and life
assurers were providing a firm support at the 16,000 level.
Mr Yasuhiko Jinza, of the stock investment division at Nippon Life, Japan's
largest life assurer, said that the Nikkei would probably move between a
range of 16,000 to 19,000: 'We bought on Wednesday since we feel 16,000 is
the bottom of the near-term range,' he said.
Banks, higher on Wednesday on active short-covering, were mixed. Sanwa Bank,
recently reported to be the top earner among commercial banks, rose Y20 to
Y1,490. However, Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y10 to Y2,370 on
profit-taking and Fuji Bank lost Y10 to Y1,770.
Electronics issues ran into profit-taking by foreign investors. Many
Japanese institutional investors also believe that electronics issues have
room for a further fall due to poor earnings prospects. Hitachi fell Y7 to
Y726, Matsushita Electric Industrial lost Y10 to Y1,070 and Sony lost Y130
to Y3,830. Steelmakers were lower on liquidations by corporate investors.
Nippon Steel fell Y3 to Y285 and Kobe Steel lost Y4 to Y296.
Roadbuilders rose on reports that the ruling Liberal Democratic Party would
apply for Y76,000bn in a five-year road construction project. Maeda Road
Construction gained Y70 to Y2,650 and Nippon Hodo gained Y40 to Y1,940.
In Osaka, the OSE average gained 129.55 to 18,211.62 in volume of 40.2m
shares.
