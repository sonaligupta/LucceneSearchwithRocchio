FOKUS Bank, Norway's third biggest commercial bank, yesterday reported that
it had bounced back to pre-tax profit of NKr246.8m for the nine-month period
of this year from a loss of NKr399.7m in the same period last year, writes
Karen Fossli in Oslo.
Fokus attributed the sharp improvement to a 50 per cent increase in credit
losses, lower costs, and an improvement in securities and foreign exchange
gains.
Group net interest income slipped to NKr821m from NKr868.4m in spite of a 50
per cent reduction in interest costs to NKr1.23bn from NK2.46bn.
Operating profit, before credit losses, rose to NKr500m from NKr193m as
credit losses were cut by more than half to NKr301.1m, or 1.33 per cent of
gross loans, from NKr620.4m.
Fokus said the volume of non-performing loans had declined by 33 per cent
since end of last year but attributed the distribution of loan losses to 74
per cent by the corporate sector and 26 per cent by private customers.
'It is with satisfaction we announce that positive developments in our
result have continued. Even without income from securities and foreign
exchange operations the bank shows a profit after losses,' Fokus said.
The bank achieved securities gains of NKr131m against losses of NKr76.5m
during last year's nine-month period as foreign currency gains more than
doubled to NKr46.8m from NKr20.2m.
Fokus returned a net profit of NKr246.8m against a net loss of NKr432.2m
last year. Group operating costs were cut to NKr770.2 from NKr1.01bn.
'The bank is now seeing the results of a major turnround operation and we
will continue to reduce operating costs,' Fokus said.
