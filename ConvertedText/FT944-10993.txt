FT  08 NOV 94 / International Company News: Seita sees higher 1994 profits
after strong first half


   By REUTER


   PARIS


Seita, the French state-owned tobacco group which is due to be privatised,
recorded a 1994 net first-half profit of FFr254m (Dollars 48.58m) on
turnover which rose 6.5 per cent to FFr7.5bn, the company said, Reuter
reports from Paris.
It added that it expected net profit for the full year to exceed 1993's
FFr585m.
The company described the first-half result as 'promising'.
Seita added that first-half sales could not be compared with those of 1993
because it was the first time it had given six-month consolidated figures.
But it estimated that sales growth for the year will be higher than 6.5 per
cent.
Operating profit for the first half of 1994 totalled FFr467.7m, which
amounted to 87 per cent of the operating profit for all of 1993.
The government announced last month that it planned to privatise Seita,
which owns all France's cigarette factories and controls the distribution of
all other brands, but did not say when the sale would take place. Financial
analysts have valued the company at between FFr7bn and FFr8bn.
