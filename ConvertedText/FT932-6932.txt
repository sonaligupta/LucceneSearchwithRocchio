FT  26 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Smaller Cos Trust placing


   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor


Smaller Companies Investment Trust, which is managed by Abtrust Fund
Managers, is attempting to raise Pounds 21.25m via a placing with clawback.
UBS is placing 3.6m units at 590p each with existing investors able to
clawback on the basis of one unit for every five ordinary shares. The units
will be converted into ordinary shares and warrants at the undiluted net
asset value on June 16.
The trust believes the time is right to increase its investments in small
companies.
It has also declared an unchanged interim dividend of 1.2p per share for the
six months to June 30.
