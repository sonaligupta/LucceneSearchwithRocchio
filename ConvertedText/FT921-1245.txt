   HONG KONG


WHARF Communications, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Wharf Holdings, the main
public company founded by the late Hong Kong shipping tycoon Sir Yue-kong
Pao, announced it had reached agreement with the privately-owned CNT Group
to form a partnership to own Rediffusion (Hong Kong), Reuter reports from
Hong Kong.
Wharf Communications will own 76 per cent of Rediffusion and become the
managing partner. CNT, which is controlled by the family interests of Mr
Tsui Tsin-tong, will continue to own the remaining interest, Wharf said.
Mr Tsui Tsin-tong, Rediffusion chairman, said the new partnership would
strengthen Rediffusion's strategic and competitive position.
'Rediffusion represents a strategic step for Wharf in the implementation of
our telecommunications strategy,' said Wharf.
