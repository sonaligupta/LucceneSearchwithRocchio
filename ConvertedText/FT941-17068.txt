FT  06 JAN 94 / Observer: By any other name


Arguably the world's toughest military assignment - or the most frustrating
 -is to pass to Britain's Lt Gen Sir Michael Rose, newly appointed commander
of UN forces in Bosnia. Just knighted, he may regard his projection into
international prominence with mixed feelings. Both predecessors, France's
Philippe Morillon and Belgium's Francis Briquemont got into deep water by
taking a high public profile. The latter is leaving after complaining about
having too few troops and being hounded by bureaucracy.
Sir Michael, 53, currently commanding the UK Field Army, may well be more
discreet. Like Britain's Gulf war commander, Sir Peter de la Billiere, the
new man is a former special forces chief. During his time in the SAS he was
awarded the Queen's Gallantry Medal. But what for, the army felt unable to
say.
