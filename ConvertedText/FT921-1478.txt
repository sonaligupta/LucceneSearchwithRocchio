FT  24 MAR 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report


   By REUTERS


Three-months ALUMINIUM prices bounced off the key Dollars 1,300 a tonne
level on the LME, but still closed well below Friday. The market came under
pressure from hedge selling and liquidation, with fundamentals pointing
downwards. LME stock figures are forecast to rise again today. Trade in
other LME metals was largely routine, with little emerging in the way of
news to disturb markets from recent ranges. GOLD closed almost unchanged on
the London bullion market. Dealers said the market was moving to test the
upside of its Dollars 336 to Dollars 340 a troy ounce range in the absence
of the physical sales that sent the market to near six-year lows last week.
PLATINUM was fixed at Dollars 351.50 before retesting the the day's highs
around Dollars 352 on news that the death toll in weekend fighting at Impala
Platinum's Bafokeng North mine had risen to 13. About 8,000 employees on the
morning shift did not report for work yesterday. Platinum faces stiff
resistance at Dollars 358, but is garnering support from expectations of a
Japanese discount rate cut.
