FT  12 APR 94 / Arts: Today's Television


   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY


In Omnibus the BBC pays tribute to Sir John Gielgud who will be 90 on
Thursday. Having been acclaimed for his Shakespearian roles in the 1920s and
30s he was ridiculed in the late 50s, after the advent of kitchen sink
drama, for the deliberate beauty of his delivery. But Gielgud has lived long
enough to see off his detractors (10.00 BBC1).
Unhappily Benny Hill died before his own renaissance, but it will come of
course. His traditional comedy will outlast the feminists in charge of
television, mostly men, whose slavish devotion to 'kissing the arse of the
zeitgeist' (thank you Barbara Amiel) led to such shameful abandonment of
Hill in the 1980s. Today ITV screens a half-hour programme, recorded on both
sides of the Atlantic, completed just before his death in 1992, and not
shown previously in Britain (9.30).
BBC2 begins a series devoted to home improvement, furnishing and decoration:
Home Front (8.30). 40 Minutes, now living under sentence of death, reports
on the way that people are affected by the repossession of their homes (9.45
BBC2).
