FT  21 DEC 92 / OECD sees Italy's growth rate rising


   By EDWARD BALLS


ITALIAN economic growth will begin to accelerate towards the end of next
year if the government succeeds in bringing Italy's fiscal deficit under
control while keeping the lid on wage inflation, the OECD said yesterday.
Restoring confidence in the lira, by ensuring that the government's fiscal
austerity measures are fully implemented, is the route to economic growth,
the Paris-based organisation says in a cautiously optimistic report.
The OECD expects Italy's economic growth rate to slip to 0.8 per cent next
year. But an export- and investment-led recovery should deliver a 1.7 per
cent growth rate in 1994.
The forecast depends on the government overcoming domestic resistance to
budget cuts in order to reduce the fiscal deficit to 10.2 per cent of gross
domestic product in 1993.
A successful budget consolidation should boost confidence, enable the lira
to re-enter the ERM and reduce Italian interest rates over the coming year
in line with expected cuts in German interest rates, the report says.
Tight monetary conditions, tax increases, the abolition of wage indexation
and a freeze on public sector pay until the end of 1993, should all dampen
the impact of the lira's recent devaluation on inflation, the OECD says.
Exports are expected to grow by 6.1 per cent next year and 5.9 per cent in
1994, outstripping the growth in imports and pushing the trade account into
a modest surplus in 1994.
