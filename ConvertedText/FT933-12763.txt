FT  22 JUL 93 / International Company News: IRI to receive L2,000bn tax
windfall

IRI, Italy's biggest state holding company which has total group debts of
about L73,000bn (Dollars 45.68bn), is set to receive around L2,000bn in
unpaid tax credits.
The funds, part of a L3,500bn package of tax credits being reimbursed to
various companies, should give the group a breathing space pending further
restructuring and asset sales.
The IRI group lost L4,809bn after tax last year. Losses at many operations -
notably Ilva (steel) and Iritecna (construction and general contracting) -
have continued to rise, while expected privatisation receipts have so far
fallen behind schedule. As a result, the group expects to lose about
L5,200bn in 1993.
Details of which companies would receive the tax credits were due to be
announced last night following cabinet approval this week for a decree
authorising repayment.
