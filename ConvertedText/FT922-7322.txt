FT  19 MAY 92 / National Grid faces first big inquiry


   By CHRIS TIGHE


A PUBLIC inquiry starting today into plans to upgrade 50 miles of power
lines in Cleveland and North Yorkshire will constitute a test of the
environmental implications of the electricity industry's privatisation.
The National Grid Company, fighting its first big public inquiry since it
was established in 1990 under the electricity supply industry's
restructuring, wants to erect 50 miles of 400 kV powerlines, carried on 150
ft high pylons, between Lackenby on Teesside and Shipton, near York.
The 1,875MW Enron plant, the world's biggest gas-fired power station, under
construction on Teesside, was the catalyst. The upgrading will allow
Teesside Power, the consortium behind the Pounds 800m plant, to feed
electricity into the central pool for sale.
The Pounds 200m grid reinforcement will also provide additional spare
capacity in anticipation of imports of electricity from Scotland and the
construction of more power stations, underlining fears over the
environmental impact of the trend towards gas-fired power stations in a
liberated energy marketplace.
The inquiry, due to last at least 10 weeks, opens in Northallerton, North
Yorkshire.
NGC is proposing two alternative routes for the Teesside section, one
skirting the Cleveland Hills, the other - opposed by the government-funded
Teesside Development Corporation - criss-crossing the Tees. Three
alternative routes are proposed through the rural Vale of York.
NGC will counter calls for underground cabling by saying that costs 10 to 15
times as much as overhead lines. It denies that overhead lines pose a health
risk.
NGC's plans provoked 7,000 objections; 200 individuals and organisations
will speak at the inquiry. Objectors include the Department of Transport,
Cleveland and North Yorkshire county councils.
