FT  13 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading


   By JOEL KIBAZO


Hopes of a reduction in European interest rates boosted stock index futures,
helping the lead contract finish above an important support level, writes
Joel Kibazo.
The Liffe June contract on the FT-SE 100 opened strongly at 3,173, with
buying activity following on from Monday's strong after-hours' trading.
Continued demand helped the contract advance to the day's high of 3,185 in
late morning.
Profit-taking saw the contract retreat from its peak to trade in a narrow
10-point range for the next few hours before the poor start in New York
brought renewed selling in the last hour.
June finished at 3,170, and cheered dealers who regard 3,164 as an important
support level. The close was at a premium to cash and just above its fair
value premium to cash of between 5 and 9 points. Turnover at the official
close was 9,954 lots. Volume in the Liffe Mid 250 June future was 93 lots as
it closed at 3,805.
There was a significant recovery in turnover in traded options, which saw
business of 47,125 lots. The index options accounted for most of the day's
total, with 17,452 contracts dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and 11,168 in the
Euro FT-SE 100 option. Shell Transport was the most active stock option,
with 3,393 lots traded.
