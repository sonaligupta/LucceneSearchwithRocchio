FT  26 OCT 92 / Brazil acts over trade imbalance


   By CHRISTINA LAMB


BRAZIL's foreign minister flew to Buenos Aires at the weekend to meet
Argentinian officials in an attempt to resolve the trade imbalance
threatening Mercosul, the nascent free trade arrangement.
A shift in trade in favour of Brazil was straining relations between the two
neighbours, Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso said earlier at a Mercosul
conference in Canela, southern Brazil. 'You cannot have a good accord when
just one side is winning,' he said.
The gap has emerged because of Argentina's relatively low import tariffs and
what is generally perceived to be an overvalued exchange rate. The country
is heading for its first annual trade deficit in 11 years.
Brazil has been the main beneficiary; its sales to Argentina rose 142 per
cent in the first half. This year it expects a Dollars 1bn (Pounds 588m)
surplus with Argentina - the reverse of the previous three years.
Argentine industrialists accuse their Brazilian counterparts of dumping to
counter a domestic recession and are demanding market restrictions. But Mr
Marcos Azambuja, Brazilian envoy in Buenos Aires, argues: 'If we do not
export, other countries will.'
Mr Cardoso said he would tell Mr Domingo Cavallo, the Argentine economy
minister, that Brazil was willing to compensate through purchases of
Argentine oil and increased quotas on wheat and flour. He added the problem
had nothing to do with the Mercosul treaty, which was working well.
But some participants at the conference warned that Brazil's failure to
achieve economic stability could threaten the agreement between Brazil,
Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay.
