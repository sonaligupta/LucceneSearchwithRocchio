FT  08 NOV 94 / People: Forte


FORTE has appointed Peter Cardnell, 39, managing director of County Hotels,
a new company which it created last month for lower-grade hotels which will
no longer carry the group name.
Cardnell has been with Forte for 21 years, most recently as executive
director of Forte Heritage. County consists of 80 hotels which no longer fit
into any of Forte's other brands and the company hopes to find a buyer or
joint venture partner for it.
