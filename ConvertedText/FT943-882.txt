FT  27 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Close Brothers 86% ahead to Pounds 33m


   By NICHOLAS DENTON


Close Brothers, the fifth largest quoted UK merchant bank has sustained its
record of profit growth, and for the year to July 31 announced pre-tax
profits ahead from Pounds 17.82m to Pounds 33.06m.
The 86 per cent advance was achieved on operating income of Pounds 76.9m
(Pounds 53.1m), up 45 per cent.
The half-year results had exceeded market expectations but the full-year
figures diverged only marginally from analysts' forecasts and the share
price closed unchanged at 215p.
Earnings were diluted by the Pounds 17m share issue made by Close Brothers
to finance the acquisition last year of Winterflood Securities, the market
maker in the shares of smaller companies.
Earnings per share increased by 61 per cent from 13.7p to 22.1p.
Winterfloods, traditional merchant banking and asset financing contributed
in roughly equal measure to total profits.
Subtracting the impact of the acquisition of Winterfloods, Close Brothers'
other activities showed an increase in profit contribution of about 50 per
cent.
This figure too was flattered by a fall in provisioning for bad and doubtful
debts from Pounds 7.74m to Pounds 4.85m. Stripping out this line, underlying
and organic profits growth at Close Brothers was about 27 per cent,
according to one anal-yst.
The proposed final dividend of 5p (3.9p adjusted) lifts the total from an
adjusted 5.5p to 7.5p.
Total assets at the year-end had improved by 24 per cent to Pounds 715m
(Pounds 575m).
COMMENT
Close Brothers is a victim of its own success. The firm's results cannot
rebound because they never fell; the company yesterday reported its 19th
consecutive year of profits growth. The reduction in provisioning has gone
about as far as it can. Further improvement in results has to be achieved on
top of a high base. Winterflood Securities may have had a record year but
analysts judge it is past its peak and will prove a drag on profits growth
in the current year. Nor does Close Brothers have the steady fee income that
other larger firms have through their fund management arms. That said, Close
Brothers' record is not one to sniff at: consistent profits growth; the
lowest cost-income ratio in the merchant bank sector; and the highest return
on equity. Merchant banking and asset finance are well-placed to benefit
from the economic recovery in which Close Brothers say their clients are
clearly sharing. Analysts' forecasts of roughly stable profits of Pounds
42m-Pounds 44m give a prospective p/e of about 10. Its small discount to the
sector's 10.3 rates a tentative buy.
