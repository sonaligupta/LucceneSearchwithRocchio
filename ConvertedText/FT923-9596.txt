FT  04 AUG 92 / World News in Brief: Moroccan loses gold on disqualification


Controversy marked the ninth day of competition at the Olympics as Khalid
Skah of Morocco was disqualified half-an-hour after winning the men's 10,000
metres. Officials ruled he had been unfairly paced by lapped fellow
countryman Hammou Boutayeb. The gold went to Kenyan Richard Chelimo. Britain
suffered a day of disappointments. The men's hockey team were knocked out,
losing 6-0 to the Australians. Colin Jackson, 110m hurdles favourite,
finished seventh behind the winner Canadian Mark McKoy. Consolation came in
the 70m archery event where unemployed roofer, Simon Terry, 18, from
Sleaford, Lincs, took the bronze medal. Olympics coverage, Page 9; Lessons
