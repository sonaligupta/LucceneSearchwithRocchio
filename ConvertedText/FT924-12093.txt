FT  22 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Boxmore rises 23% to top Pounds 2m mark


BACKED UP by the acquisition of Airopak in the latter part of 1991, all
operations at Boxmore increased sales and profit for the half year to June
30 1992.
Including Pounds 3.64m from Airopak, turnover of this packaging
manufacturing group rose from Pounds 10.1m to Pounds 15.8m and pre-tax
profit expanded nearly 23 per cent to Pounds 2.05m (Pounds 1.67m).
Airopak contributed to operating profit, but its purchase was made out of
cash resources which had an affect on interest receivable. Good progress had
been made in assimilating it into the group.
The carton division increased sales by 46 per cent, reflecting customer
satisfaction and the benefit of recent investment. In plastics they rose 9
per cent before taking in Airopak.
Earnings per share came to 7.3p (6.2p) and the interim dividend is 1.15p
(adjusted 1.075p).
