FT  29 JUL 92 / Free-fall rouble tumbles further


   By REUTER


   MOSCOW


The rouble tumbled further against the dollar on Moscow's small-scale
currency exchange yesterday, with no floor in sight for the battered
currency, Reuter reports from Moscow.
The rouble changed hands at Rbs161.1 to the dollar on the Moscow Interbank
Currency Exchange after 155.7 at the last trading session on Thursday and
130.2 earlier this month.
'The central bank is intervening less in the market and the rouble has been
falling ever since,' said a trader at Russia's Vneshtorgbank.
