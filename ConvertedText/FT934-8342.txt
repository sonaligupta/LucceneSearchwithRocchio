FT  16 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Exchange makes first changes to new FT-SE
Actuaries indices


   By RICHARD GOURLAY


THE STOCK Exchange yesterday made the first changes to the proposed new
FT-SE Actuaries share indices which will become effective from January 4
next year.
By changing the name of certain sub-sectors and removing another, the
Exchange is likely to have appeased many of the most vociferous critics of
the classifications.
Out goes the Copper Mining sub-sector, incorporated into the Other Mineral
Extractors and Mines sub-sector of the Extractive Industries sector, which
deals with the misgivings of RTZ, the diversified mining company.
The Conglomerates sector is now to be called Diversified Industrials,
thereby removing a point of contention with BTR, the industrial holding
company.
Rank Organisation, the diversified leisure and office products group which
was among the most distressed by its earlier classification, moves from the
provisional Office Machinery sub-sector to Leisure.
Classification of Inchcape, the motors and business services group, remains
the biggest outstanding issue. Its position will be studied by the Stock
Exchange's classification committee when it meets again on the next two
Mondays.
Inchcape had asked to be put in the Conglomerates sector.
After the review, all 2,375 listed and USM-quoted companies will have been
found new homes within seven economic groupings, 40 sectors and 76
sub-sectors.
Companies are allocated to a sector according to the business area from
which they derive the majority of their profits.
Also on the move are Morgan Crucible and Glynwed International - both from
Building Materials to Engineering Diversified; Charter and Cookson go from
Building Materials and Chemicals Speciality respectively to Diversified
Industrials.
The Print Services sub-sector is renamed Printing and moves from the Support
Services sector to Paper & Packaging which has been renamed Printing, Paper
& Packaging.
Retailers, Multi-Department and Retailers, Chain Stores have been merged to
form Retailers, General Sector. Multi-Department and Chain Stores will be
sub-sectors.
The Retailers, Vehicle Distributors Sector is disbanded and Vehicle
Distributors becomes a sub-sector of the Distributors Sector.
