FT  05 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Kalon/Manders


The issues in a bid are seldom black and white, not even when the offer is
from a white paint manufacturer in Yorkshire (emblem: white rose) for an
English black country rival making ink. Yesterday's undeniably impressive 55
per cent advance in interim profits from Kalon does little harm to its cause
 -but there seems no escaping the conclusion that come the weekend or sooner
the aggressor will have to sweeten its currently all-paper terms.
Kalon's management ability and recent share price and earnings records all
look superior to those of Manders. But there is a legitimate question mark
over how long Kalon will be able to sustain its juicy paint margins. The
widening which took place in the first six months of this year is largely
attributed to higher volumes in the own-label market and economies of scale.
But, with the likes of B & Q and Texas engaged in a fierce price war, how
long will it be before they expect their suppliers to suffer more of the
pain? Kalon badly needs to swallow its prey to keep its profits momentum
going, which is why Manders shareholders should hold out for a more
attractive deal. In these markets, though, a token cash element might not be
enough.
