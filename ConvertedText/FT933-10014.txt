FT  06 AUG 93 / Technology: Video highlights picked by PC - Worth Watching


   By DELLA BRADSHAW


Shooting hour upon hour of holiday videos is easy; the time-consuming part
is editing the pictures to cut out all the boring bits.
A Toronto-based software publisher, Gold Disk, has come to the rescue with a
video editing package which can be used by anyone with a Windows PC.
The would-be Spielberg watches the recording on the television and uses a
simulated version of the camcorder controls, which appear as a picture on
the PC screen, to control the recording. By pressing the 'start' and
'finish' buttons the editor isolates the sections that need to be retained,
giving each snip a title. These are then arranged in an appropriate
sequence. Gold Disk: US, 408 982 0200; UK, 071 4983275.
