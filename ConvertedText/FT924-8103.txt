FT  12 NOV 92 / Sharp rise in negative equity in homes


   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU


ONE IN FIVE homes bought in the past five years is now worth less than the
mortgage on it, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the social research body,
says in a survey today.
The survey, based on 1m homeowners, estimates that the total value of
negative equity in Britain is Pounds 2.68bn, compared with Pounds 1.2bn in
October last year. Of this, 99 per cent is held by people who have bought
homes since 1987.
The south-east has the highest proportion of negative equity, with greater
London the worst affected. Forty-one per cent of those who bought in the
London area between 1988 and 1991 had negative equity last month, the report
says, with an average deficit of Pounds 5,500 per household.
The rises for the north and north-west are comparatively low, while the rest
of the south-east and the east Midlands have the highest negative equity
outside London.
Mr Daniel Dorling, one of the report's authors, said: 'Almost no one who
bought before 1987 has negative equity.'
