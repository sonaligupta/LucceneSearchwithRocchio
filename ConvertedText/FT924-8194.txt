FT  12 NOV 92 / Observer: Dirty tricks


Canada's Conrad Black, the new boy on the Australian newspaper block, may be
bending over backwards not to upset the locals, but rival Rupert Murdoch's
men are not making life easy for him.
No sooner had Black demonstrated his love for local journalists by rehiring
a couple of old Fairfax hands to edit two of his Fairfax flagships, than a
rogue columnist on his newly acquired Australian Financial Review attacks
the changes.
Peter Robinson, a Review columnist and former editor, says the episode is
part of a wider effort to bring Fairfax into line with the 'rougher culture'
favoured by Murdoch and fellow media tycoon, Kerry Packer.
Having spiked Robinson's column, the Review's new editor was somewhat
surprised to see it appear in the Murdoch-owned Australian, the country's
leading national daily. Students of media studies will remember that this is
not the first time the Murdoch camp has tried to embarrass Black.
Not so long ago a memo from Black's Daily Telegraph management in London
detailing the alleged shortcomings of the Fairfax team fell into the hands
of Murdoch's men and was published at length.
Expect more of the same.
