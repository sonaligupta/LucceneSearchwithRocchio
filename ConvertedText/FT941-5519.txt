FT  05 MAR 94 / Mysteries of the death cells: The Nature of Thing - Millions
of dollars are pouring into the study of apoptosis


   By CLIVE COOKSON


Murder? Suicide? Plain old age? The way cells die - regarded for decades as
an obscure by-way of biology - has become a subject of burning scientific
interest.
Researchers are stampeding into the study of cell death and American venture
capitalists are racing after them, eager to pour millions of dollars into
biotechnology companies exploiting their work. They see it as a new route to
treatments for intractable diseases including cancer, Alzheimer's and Aids.
Scientists have known for many years that billions of cells die every day,
even in the healthiest people, to make room for new cells. But they have
only recently realised that all cells are programmed to perish by the same
process in every part of the body, from blood to brain, and in all creatures
from primitive worms to humans.
The process - which has the evocative name of apoptosis, from the Greek word
for the shedding of leaves - is really cell suicide. Once apoptosis has been
triggered, a cell destroys itself within a few hours. Its membranes break
down and enzymes split up the genetic material in the nucleus. At the same
time, the main body of the cell shrinks and breaks up into small pieces
which are eventually consumed by neighbouring cells.
Although three Edinburgh University cancer researchers - Andrew Wyllie, John
Kerr and the late Alastair Currie - had discovered apoptosis in the early
1970s, most biologists regarded it as no more than an interesting curiosity
until the late 1980s. They were more interested in the way cells divide and
grow and how they respond to germs and drugs than in their suicidal
behaviour.
The reason for all the excitement now is that research over the past five
years has shown apoptosis to be a far more widespread phenomenon with much
wider implications than anyone had suspected. Indeed, it turns out that all
cells are programmed to die in a clean and orderly way through apoptosis
when their time comes.
The other way a cell can die is through 'necrosis' - a much cruder process
of sudden and unprogrammed destruction following accidental injury, burns,
poisoning, asphyxiation or virulent infection.
Apoptosis plays a particularly important role at the very earliest stage of
life. It shapes the developing embryo in the womb, removing cells where they
are not needed. To take a simple example, it leaves clear spaces between the
growing toes of most animals; but in water birds the level of apoptosis is
reduced and webbing remains between the toes.
Another vital function of apoptosis - in embryonic development and then
throughout life - is apparently to maintain a natural selection process in
the body. 'What seems to be emerging from research is that the best cells
are selected for development and unwanted cells are removed,' Wyllie says.
The immune system depends on apoptosis to regulate the number of blood cells
available to defend the body against invading germs. Someone infected with a
new virus makes huge numbers of special cells to recognise and kill the
invaders; when the threat is over, almost all the defenders commit suicide,
leaving just a few to remember the virus in case it invades again.
So apoptosis is essential for maintaining a healthy balance between the
growth of new cells and elimination of old ones. If the balance is lost,
disease results.
One of the first scientists to popularise the role of apoptosis in disease
was Luc Montagnier, the French discoverer of HIV. He has been promoting for
several years the idea that the virus causes Aids by forcing too many
T-cells in the immune system to commit suicide.
Too much apoptosis may also be a cause of degenerative brain diseases such
as Alzheimer's; indeed, any apoptosis at all is bad news for the brain, as
its cells are the only ones in the body that do not renew themselves
routinely in adult life. Too little apoptosis, on the other hand, results in
the cell proliferation characteristic of cancer and the abnormal immune
reactions responsible for rheumatoid arthritis.
Hopes of intervening in the process - and shrinking tumours, for example, by
persuading their cancer cells to commit suicide - rest on finding the genes
that control apoptosis. In the humble nematode worm Caenorhabitis elegans, a
favourite subject for genetic research because of its simple structure,
Robert Horvitz and colleagues at Massachusetts Institute of Technology have
already identified 16 genes involved in apoptosis; some of these are
apparently related to human genes that may trigger or suppress cancer.
Horvitz chairs the scientific advisory board of Idun Pharmaceuticals (named
after a Nordic goddess who keeps apples bright and shining). It is one of
several biotechnology companies started recently in the US to commercialise
apoptosis research. Others include Apoptosis Technology and LXR
Biotechnology.
The prospect of manipulating cell death to cure cancer or prevent
degenerative brain disease may yet turn out to be an illusion. But the
existence of apoptosis companies shows that investors expect something to
come of it within a decade or so.
