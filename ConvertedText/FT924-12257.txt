BANGKOK Land, the property developer which became the largest company on the
Stock Exchange of Thailand when it was listed in February, has announced
plans to borrow SFr50m (Dollars 23.25m) through a new Cayman Islands
subsidiary to finance expansion.
In what one stockbroker called 'an exotic and expensive way of raising
debt', the Cayman company will issue Swiss franc notes for Swiss investors
with an annual interest of 4.5 per cent and maturity of five years, and then
lend the money to Bangkok Land after deducting expenses.
Bangkok Land, which named the trustee for the notes as DG Bank
(Switzerland), will itself act as guarantor of the issue and pay the
interest.
It will be possible for noteholders to convert the notes into Bangkok Land
shares before maturity, and 7.5m shares are to be set aside by major
shareholders for this. There are no plans to list the notes on any stock
market.
Bangkok Land, headed by Mr Anant Kanjanapas, one of Thailand's richest men,
also announced a 52 per cent rise in net profits to Bt2.27bn in the
half-year to September from Bt1.50bn (Dollars 59.4m) in the same period last
year. Net profits in the September quarter nearly doubled to Bt1.57bn.
Half-year sales rose 50 per cent to Bt7.67bn from Bt5.10bn, but some brokers
were disappointed by the results of a company they regard as a speculative
property play.
The market for office space and high-class residential property in Thailand
has softened this year, but Bangkok Land has concentrated on the more
buoyant low-income housing sector.
Its main project is Muang Thong Thani, a planned residential, commercial and
industrial satellite city near Bangkok's airport, is billed as the world's
largest private property development.
