FT  22 OCT 92 / Amato denies retreat on taxes


PROFESSOR Giuliano Amato, the Italian prime minister, had to call a press
conference yesterday to deny reports that the government was watering down
taxation measures in the 1993 budget.
Reports appeared on the front pages of all Italian daily newspapers
yesterday that the government had given way to pressure from the Christian
Democrat party to reduce the scope of proposals to bring self-employed,
artisans, small businessmen and traders within the tax net.
The proposals have provoked protest in recent days from these groups who in
the past have been the leading tax evaders.
