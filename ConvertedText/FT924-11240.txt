FT  27 OCT 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Partnerships not prepared
for death - In a nutshell


Many business partnerships are unprepared for the problems which can arise
if a partner dies, falls ill or wants to retire, according to a survey* by
London Life, an assurance company.
Sixty three per cent of those interviewed said that in the event of a
partner's sudden death it would not be possible to replace their experience
quickly, although three-quarters believed the partnership could continue in
business.
Nearly two-thirds said their partnership would suffer if a partner became
seriously ill but, even so, 70 per cent had made no arrangements to insure
against such an event.
Forty per cent of partnerships had no formula to work out the amount of
capital which new partners would require to buy into the business, making it
more difficult for prospective partners to plan their finances.
The researchers spoke to 300 partnerships.
