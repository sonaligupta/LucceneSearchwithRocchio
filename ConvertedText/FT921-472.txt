FT  28 MAR 92 / Bonn to alter guarantees to Airbus Industrie


   By REUTER


   BONN


BONN is to alter guarantees it gives the German arm of Airbus Industrie to
protect it from currency fluctuations, an Economics Ministry official said,
Reuter reports from Bonn.
The official confirmed remarks by a senior official at Europe's Airbus
Industrie in Seattle on Thursday that the guarantees for Deutsche Airbus, a
unit of Daimler-Benz, would be adjusted so they no longer ran counter to
Gatt regulations.
A General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) dispute panel ruled in
January against the exchange rate guarantees saying they were a subsidy
distorting industry competition.
