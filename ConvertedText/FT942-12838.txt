FT  27 APR 94 / Sales of Mercedes-Benz cars increase by 30%: Chairman says
deliveries of new model beat forecasts and reach 200,000 - Turnover up 28%

Sales of Mercedes-Benz cars rose more than 30 per cent in the first quarter
of this year in all the marque's most important markets, Mr Helmut Werner,
its chairman, said yesterday.
Deliveries of the new bottom-of-the-range C-Class model had exceeded
expectations by reaching almost 200,000 since the launch last summer, he
said.
Total turnover at Mercedes, which is the vehicles arm of Daimler-Benz group,
rose 28 per cent to DM16.1bn (Dollars 9.4bn) in the three months, with
passenger vehicles contributing DM9.5bn.
Sales for the full year were likely to rise 7 per cent to exceed DM69bn, and
the company was now confident of returning a positive result for 1994.
Losses in 1993 totalled DM1.2bn.
Claiming that Mercedes' performance was running counter to the continuing
down-trend in the rest of the car industry, Mr Werner said that even the
loss-making commercial vehicles business was gaining market share in some
sectors.
Car registrations in Germany had risen 41 per cent to 67,300 in the three
months ended March, pushing up market share 2.2 points to 8.2 per cent. Full
year registrations were expected to top 200,000.
Elsewhere in western Europe numbers rose 46 per cent to 45,000 vehicles.
Japan and the US showed increases of more than 30 per cent, he added.
Mr Werner said factory capacity utilisation had been stepped up to 70 per
cent from 65 per cent last year, and boasted that the gap between Mercedes'
and Japanese manufacturers' productivity was closing rapidly. The so-called
'productivity gap' of 35 per cent in 1992, would be down to 15 per cent by
the end of this year.
The company expected to boost 1994 car sales to more than 570,000 units
after 508,000 last year and planned to be making 850,000 in 1998, Mr Werner
said.
Meanwhile, the truck, van and bus business was still 'somewhat strained' by
large numbers of relatively new vehicles taken off the road and mothballed
by their owners during the recession.
However, while the German van market fell 7 per cent in the first quarter,
Mercedes registrations in this sector dropped only 1 per cent, Mr Werner
said. Sales in other west European countries rose 4 per cent while the
overall market fell 10 per cent.
Foreign heavy truck operations, notably Freightliner in the US and Mercedes
of Brazil, increased output 17 per cent to 26,500 units.
Mercedes' commercial vehicle operations are undergoing restructuring, and
are not expected to break even until next year.
Mr Werner confirmed a further 8,000 jobs were to be cut this year followed
by 4,000 next year.
