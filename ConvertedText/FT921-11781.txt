FT  30 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Allied Textile declines to Pounds 13.2m


   By DANIEL GREEN


FALLING PROPERTY prices last year prompted Allied Textile Companies to
suspend property sales and led to a decline, from Pounds 13.7m to Pounds
13.2m, in pre-tax profits.
Problems in its financial activities were in contrast to the textile side,
which contributed Pounds 8.5m (Pounds 8.3m) despite a fall in wool values
which left overall turnover for the year to September 30 slightly lower at
Pounds 112.2m (Pounds 115.3m).
'Current trading remains extremely difficult,' said Mr John Corrin, chief
executive. 'It will be hard to match 1991's profit this year. We will
continue to rationalise as necessary.'
Closing businesses in 1991 led to an extraordinary charge of Pounds 377,000
(Pounds 644,000).
'We reduced staff by 290 and closed six textiles sites,' said Mr Corrin. The
company now employs 2,220 people.
Earnings per share fell by 1.4p to 31.7p as the company issued more shares
through employee share option schemes.
The final dividend is increased by 0.2p to 7.9p, making a total of 12.3p
(12p).
The company has net cash of Pounds 17m and Mr Corrin said there was 'no
question of the dividend being cut.'
A change in accounting practice, the valuing of fixed assets, largely listed
investments, at market prices rather than original cost, contributed to a 51
per cent jump in fixed assets to Pounds 37.7m.
