FT  16 DEC 94 / People: Carrying on


   By WILLIAM HALL


John Toyne, a transport consultant, has been appointed group managing
director of United Carriers which has upset investors by making two profits
warnings in the nine months since it was floated on the stock market.
Toyne, 51, replaces Michael Howe who was sacked last month following the
second profit warning. The first setback was blamed on too few parcels; the
second on too many. The shares - floated at 153p - were unchanged at 83p
yesterday. Alan Binks, who lost his job as chairman but retained the title
of chief executive, admitted at the time that the return to the market had
been 'a right mess'.
Toyne joined Imperial Group in 1965 and has spent over 20 years in
production and personnel management. As chief executive of Lowfield, a
grocery distribution business, he led the management buy-out from Hanson in
1988. Lowfield was acquired by Tibbett & Britten in 1989 and Toyne sat on
the Tibbett board until last year. Most recently he has been operating as a
consultant in the transport sector and advising on a number of management
buy-outs.
