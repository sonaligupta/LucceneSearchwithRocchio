FT  12 MAR 92 / Technology: Reported speech on the books


   By PHILIP HUNTER


Businesses that produce reports in different languages are obvious
candidates for machine translation. But so far, real cost savings have been
elusive, partly because the available systems only do part of the job.
Considerable work is still needed to finalise the text in a specific
language.
Dun & Bradstreet's Swiss subsidiary produces financial and market reports in
English, French, German and Italian. It used to pay out large sums to human
translators.
Of 75,000 reports sent to customers each year, 17.2 per cent required
translation. This cost the subsidiary SFr 230,000 (Pounds 88,000) a year.
Now the company has computerised the translation. Apart from eliminating the
cost, it means all reports are delivered quickly whether or not they've been
translated.
Some organisations, including the European Commission, use machine-assisted
translation in which computers produce a draft of the document in the target
language. This is cleaned up to produce the final document.
Dun & Bradstreet Switzerland has managed to avoid the cleaning-up process.
Rather than translating grammar, the company constructed tables of stock
phrases and words that are required in finished reports.
By using only these expressions it is possible to make translations that are
entirely accurate.
This approach at first drew criticism from the company's competitors, who
claimed it would make the reports too standardised with no freedom of
self-expression for the writers. More important, it was resisted from within
the company. 'We lost the people who wouldn't work with it,' admits Adrian
Ashurst, managing director.
But customers reacted favourably because they were receiving the same
product more quickly and cheaply. Some even preferred the new type of
document because it was more consistent. The whole system cost the company
SFr250,000.
