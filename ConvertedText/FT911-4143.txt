FT  20 APR 91 / Treuhand deal for Warburg


   By DAVID GOODHART

SG WARBURG, the UK merchant bank, has been given the job of selling
Interhotel, east Germany's luxury hotel chain, by the Treuhand privatisation
agency.
Mr Piers von Simson, Warburg executive in charge of the operation, says he
is hoping to raise about DM3bn (Pounds 1bn) from the sale of the hotels.
The Treuhand has so far made only limited use of investment banking
expertise, but JP Morgan provided help with the recent sale of east
Germany's regional newspapers and Warburg was also involved in the sale of
the retail chain Centrum to Kaufhof, Hertie and Karstadt, three big west
German groups.
Some east German companies have also hired investment banks to help them
find purchasers. Carl Zeiss Jena, the instruments group, engaged Salomon
Bros.
A Treuhand official said the organisation had originally hoped to sell, or
give, packages of companies to banks, which would then take responsibility
for restructuring and sell them on.
'But the banks have not been interested in taking that sort of risk so we
are using investment banks in a standard way to provide technical
assistance,' said the official.
The 35 Interhotel hotels are among east Germany's prime commercial and
property assets. The sale is certain to attract most of the world's
international hotel groups. Staff in the hotels has already been reduced
from 12,500 to 5,000 and there will be no strings attached regarding future
employment for the purchasers, according to Mr von Simson.
One hotel group could buy the whole chain, but it is more likely to be sold
in four or five packages. Mr von Simson said that, for some international
groups, the east German hotels could be a step into the west German hotel
industry through arranging swaps with west German chains. Potential
purchasers have to make their interest clear this month.
