FT  03 AUG 92 / Letter: No conflict with no profit


   From Mr MALCOLM HURLSTON


Sir, There need be no conflict between privatisation (of Companies House or
anything else) and the requirement in the First Companies Directive that
information should be made available at cost.
Mr Fleming (Letters, July 29) might like to hear that Registry Trust was set
up as a non-profit company in 1985 and has now operated the registry of
county court judgments for the Lord Chancellor's department for six years
with uncontested success, playing an important part in the control of
indebtedness. For most customers and most of the time, higher efficiency has
been delivered at a lower price.
