FT  11 APR 92 / Finance & The Family (At A Glance): Pearl cuts savings
bonuses


Pearl Assurance has reduced its bonuses on with-profits savings contracts.
The adjustments to the contracts are complex, and vary between the ordinary
and industrial branches. The overall effect follows the trend for the
industry, with pay-outs for 10-year policies hit hard, while 25-year policy
maturity values have risen slightly.
Using the standard assumption that policies were started by a 29-year-old
man paying premiums of Pounds 30 per month, the ten-year has dropped by 6
per cent from Pounds 8,046 (which made it one of the market leaders) to
Pounds 7,561. Pay-outs over 25 years increased by 0.3 per cent from Pounds
55,462 to Pounds 55,631.
