FT  27 MAR 92 / International Company News: Senior commissioner at SEC
resigns


   By PATRICK HARVERSON


MR Edward Fleischman resigned last night as senior commissioner at the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) after years of feuding with Mr
Richard Breeden, the US watchdog's ambitious chairman.
The departure of the combative Mr Fleischman came as no surprise to
Washington insiders.
In recent years he had publicly disagreed with Mr Breeden over a number of
policy issues, arguing that the chairman wanted to stifle dissent within the
SEC and play down the power and influence of its four commissioners.
Mr Fleischman was particularly critical of the way decisions have been taken
at the SEC under Mr Breeden. In a controversial speech to the American Bar
Association in Atlanta last August, the commissioner charged that too many
key policy decisions were being made behind closed doors and that the SEC
was no longer publicly accountable for its actions.
The dissenting commissioner also argued that 'regulatory ambition' had crept
into the SEC during Mr Breeden's tenure, a veiled reference to the
widely-held view that Mr Breeden was using his chairmanship of the
commission as a springboard to political advancement in the Bush
administration.
Mr Fleischman's term as commissioner was scheduled to expire in June.
He could have sought renomination, but has decided instead to leave the SEC
next week to join New York law firm Rosenman & Colin, where he will become a
partner.
He said last night: 'I've been here too long,' and went on to say that
during his time at the SEC he had seen the 'diminishment of my role and that
of other commissioners'.
