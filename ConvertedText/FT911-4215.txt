Kleinwort Benson has established a separate organisation to manage its

Benson Investment Trust Management (KBITM) said the aim was to develop the
trusts and to enhance the perception of the group as IT managers.
KBITM has Pounds 800m under management and the largest trust, Merchants,
which was established in 1889, has assets of more than Pounds 250m.
