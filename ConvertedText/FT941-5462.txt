FT  07 MAR 94 / Poland passes budget


   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI


   WARSAW


Poland's 1994 budget was passed at the weekend by the Sejm, parliament's
more important chamber, as the Solidarity trade union prepared for a
campaign of protest strikes due to start today, writes Christopher Bobinski
from Warsaw.
The budget, which is in tune with IMF guidelines, opens the way to new
standby credits and a 20 per cent reduction of Poland's Dollars 33bn (Pounds
22.6bn) debt to western governments. It won the overwhelming support of the
governing coalition parties despite initial demands from individual deputies
that spending restrictions be eased.
Solidarity, which is planning to disrupt rail services and power and
telecommunications links over the next few days, is demanding that controls
on wages be eased and the scale of planned energy price rises reduced. The
government led by Mr Waldemar Pawlak is now expected to nominate Mr Dariusz
Rosati, an economist in his late 40s who is a specialist in foreign trade
issues, as the new finance minister and deputy premier responsible for the
economy.
Mr Rosati's views on the economy are similar to those of Mr Marek Borowski,
his predecessor who drafted this year's stringent budget.
