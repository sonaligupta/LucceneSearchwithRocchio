FT  11 APR 92 / UK Company News: Willam Jacks cuts loss to Pounds 850,000


William Jacks, the motor dealer with Mercedes, Jaguar, Rover, BMW, Saab, and
VAG franchises, improved over the second half.
It finished with a loss of Pounds 850,000 for the year ended January 31
1992, after Pounds 601,000 at midway. For the previous year the deficit was
Pounds 872,000.
The group was helped by proceeds from last September's convertible
preference rights issue which, together with a significant reduction in
working capital, substantially strengthened finances.
Turnover fell to Pounds 41.9m (Pounds 42.6m). New car turnover was within
1.5 per cent of the previous year, although that was achieved on
significantly lower margins.
Operating profit was maintained at Pounds 286,000 (Pounds 272,000) through a
substantial cut in expenses and an encouraging growth in after-sales
activities.
New car sales in January and February were 'generally encouraging'. Certain
manufacturers appeared to be establishing better controls over the creation
of large unsold stocks, with a beneficial effect on margins.
