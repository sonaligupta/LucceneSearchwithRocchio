FT  30 JUN 93 / Non-aligned defer to rich nations' summit


   By WILLIAM KEELING


   JAKARTA


INDONESIA'S President Suharto yesterday accepted Japan's invitation to visit
Tokyo immediately before the summit of the Group of Seven leading
industrialised nations which starts a week today, thereby resolving a
possible diplomatic wrangle.
Indonesia had asked to attend the summit as head of the 108-member
Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) in order to present the views of developing
countries. The issue of Indonesia's attendance had been embarrassing G7
members, which were concerned to avoid setting a precedent.
As one G7 diplomat explained: 'We currently have a very sensible and
moderate chairman of NAM but we do not want ..in six years' time to be faced
with inviting Gadaffi of Libya.'
Mr Suharto will now visit Tokyo from July 4-6 and meet Mr Kiichi Miyazawa,
the prime minister. Japan has promised to include matters raised by
Indonesia on the summit agenda. President Suharto may also take up an
invitation to meet President Clinton and may meet other leaders.
Indonesia pledged to improve north-south dialogue when it took over the NAM
chairmanship last year. Items likely to be raised by Mr Suharto in Tokyo are
debt relief for the world's poorest nations and the effect of unstable
commodity prices on the export earnings of developing countries.
