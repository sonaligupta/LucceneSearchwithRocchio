FT  22 JUL 93 / International Company News: Disposals gain boosts General
Dynamics


   By MARTIN DICKSON


GENERAL DYNAMICS yesterday reported a 58 per cent rise in second-quarter
earnings from continuing operations, while fellow US defence contractor
Northrop reported a 4 per cent increase in net income.
General Dynamics, which has been shrinking through asset sales to cope with
huge overcapacity in the US defence industry, reported earnings of Dollars
57m, or Dollars 1.80 a share, from continuing operations. These are against
Dollars 36m, or 82 cents in the same period last year.
Sales totalled Dollars 793m, down from Dollars 852m.
The latest quarter was boosted by a non-recurring gain of Dollars 9m, or 28
cents, from the recognition of previously-deferred gains from asset sales.
The per-share earnings figure was helped by the company's repurchase last
July of some 30 per cent of its stock.
The nuclear submarines business increased the earnings rates for 688 class
and Trident vessels, while the armoured vehicles business lifted income due
to productivity increases and expanded production for foreign markets.
Businesses which General Dynamics classifies as discontinued, but not yet
sold, earned Dollars 4m, compared with Dollars 50m a year ago, when the
figures included Dollars 44m from businesses sold in the past year.
For the six months the company reported earnings from continuing operations
of Dollars 98m, up from Dollars 66m.
Northrop, meanwhile, reported second-quarter income of Dollars 53m, or
Dollars 1.12 a share, compared with Dollars 51m, or Dollars 1.08 a share.
Sales totalled Dollars 1.31bn, down 9 per cent on the same period of 1992.
The company attributed the increase in net income primarily to improved
operating profits in its aircraft business and a lower loss in missiles and
unmanned vehicles.
Figures in the second quarter last year were depressed by a Dollars 9m loss
provision.
