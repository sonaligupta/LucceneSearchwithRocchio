FT  10 JAN 92 / Yugoslav army 'not told of EC flight'


   By JUDY DEMPSEY


   SARAJEVO


THE Yugoslav army yesterday blamed poor co-ordination and mistakes in air
control for the shooting down of a European Community helicopter by a
military jet and the killing of five EC monitors on board.
The interim report, which came as EC-sponsored peace talks resumed in
Brussels, did not explain why the pilot attacked the first helicopter and
forced a second one to crash land. The report was received by the EC
monitoring mission in Zagreb, the Croatian capital.
Four of the five dead were Italians who were buried with full honours
yesterday after a service in which Pope John Paul lamented the 'agonising
tragedy' of Yugoslavia's war.
Polityka, a pro-Serbian daily paper with close ties to the military, carried
the army's explanation, saying the EC helicopters had been in closed air
space, and federal military authorities had not been told of their incoming
flight from Kaposvar in Hungary.
The Hungarian authorities had informed the air control authorities in Zagreb
of their flight, but the MiG pilot had been in contact only with air control
headquarters in Belgrade which did not know of the helicopters' flight path.
The Yugoslav conflict was further complicated yesterday when Bosnia's Serbs
declared an autonomous Serbian republic in the region and said they were
prepared to defend themselves.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, leader of Bosnia's Serbian community, said creation of
the republic would depend on whether European Community countries recognised
the independence of Bosnia-Hercegovina next week. Such an action could lead
the Bosnian Serbians to unite with neighbouring Serbia, he added.
The 4.3m strong republic is divided between Moslems (43 per cent), Serbs (32
per cent) and Croats (17 per cent), which make up a coalition government.
