FT  16 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Not a recent change in English
company law


   From Mr E A COLEMAN


Sir, Mr Jean Thibaud's article on recent developments in French banking and
company law was most informative (Business and the Law: 'Overthrow of ancien
regime', March 8).
Allow me, however, to correct what appears to be an inaccuracy in the
article. Mr Thibaud states, in the fourth paragraph, that 'England has
recently accepted netting (ie. set-off) as a basic principle of insolvency
law. . .'. In point of fact, bankruptcy/insolvency set-off has been the rule
in England since the time of Queen Anne (see s11 of 4&5 Anne c17), if not
before (see s2 of the 1570 statute, 13 Elizabeth, c7).
Perhaps Mr Thibaud's reference to a 'recent' acceptance of netting in
England was a reference to the (somewhat belated) recognition by the
financial law panel of the principle of insolvency set-off (see the panel's
guidance note on netting of November 19 1993).
