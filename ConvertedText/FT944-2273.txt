FT  16 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets: Golds weaken in S Africa


Johannesburg was mixed, with gold shares, which had earlier been in positive
territory, turning back later in the day to close with a loss of 60.3 at
1,831.6. Brokers attributed the change in sentiment to technical trading
related to options expiry.
The overall index moved ahead 29.3 to 5,666.6 and industrials 73.6 to
6,827.3.
Dealers said the market did not respond to a stronger financial rand, which
increases the price foreign investors pay for domestic shares. Among golds,
Dries fell R3 or 5.2 per cent to R55 and Kloof R1.25 to R54.75.
