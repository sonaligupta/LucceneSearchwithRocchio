FT  26 MAY 93 / Major maps out strategy for EC


   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor


A POST-MAASTRICHT strategy to capitalise on the shift in the balance of
power in the European Community that will follow enlargement has been mapped
out by Mr John Major.
In an interview with the Financial Times, the prime minister said speedy
entry into the Community by Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway was
'pivotal' to Britain's agenda in the approach to the 1996 inter-governmental
conference.
Mr Major confirmed there is no early prospect of sterling's return to the
European exchange rate mechanism. Significantly, though, he refused to rule
out the prospect entirely over the longer term.
He was equally reluctant to translate his deep scepticism about the value of
granting independence to the Bank of England into a categorical statement
that monetary policy would remain indefinitely in the hands of the Treasury.
Mr Major said the combination of enlargement and the popular mood of
disenchantment across the Community that had come to light in the debate
over Maastricht would reinforce Britain's case for a more flexible,
decentralised Europe.
Under intense pressure to heal the wounds in the Conservative party
inflicted by Maastricht, he added that the entry of the four would 'begin to
change the culture of the Community'.
The new entrants were more committed than some existing members to free
trade and, importantly, all would be net contributors to the Brussels
budget. 'For the first time since the Community was established, you begin
to see a balance in the members between net contributors and net
recipients.'
Mr Major said the shift in the balance of power would provide the backdrop
for Britain to propose institutional changes in the 1996 conference, notably
to strengthen the accountability of the Commission.
