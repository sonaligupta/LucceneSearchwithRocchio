FT  26 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lords to face pressure on EC bill


   By ALISON SMITH


THE FORCE of convention in the House of Lords is being invoked by ministers
as they seek to secure the Maastricht Bill's swift and safe passage through
parliament in the next two months.
Government business managers have drawn up a provisional timetable, which
would mean that the legislation was passed and the pre-ratification social
chapter debates took place before MPs and peers dispersed for the summer,
probably in late July.
But the plans depend on Euro-sceptic peers of all parties keeping within the
traditions of the Lords.
Ministers believe that rebels will not make interminable speeches or put
down vast numbers of amendments because such tactics would alienate
potential dissidents who might well regard them as abuses of the Lords'
relaxed procedures.
But there is the scarcely veiled threat that the government could make the
House sit into the early hours of the morning to get through the business -
'the traditional way of damping enthusiasm', one minister said.
Ministers have already begun seeing backbenchers, and Mr Douglas Hurd, the
foreign secretary, is to meet Tory peers before the Lords embarks on the
committee stage. The Lords will hold a general two-day debate on the bill
immediately after the Whitsun recess.
Peers will then have four days for the committee stage of the bill, two days
for the report stage, and one to give the bill a third reading.
Lady Thatcher is expected to make no more than a couple of high-profile
speeches during discussion of the bill, but other Euro-sceptics - for the
moment at least - are intending to put down hundreds of amendments.
Most attention is likely to focus on the social chapter and on the
referendum campaign.
