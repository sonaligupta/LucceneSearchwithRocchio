FT  02 NOV 93 / Amec to update BP refinery


BP OIL has awarded Amec Engineering a Pounds 60m contract to install new
equipment at its refinery at Grangemouth in Fife. The work will enable the
complex to meet new European Community standards for sulphur content of
diesel fuel.
The installation of the hydrofiner will allow the refinery to reduce the
sulphur content of its diesel fuel from 0.2 per cent by weight to the new EC
standard of 0.05 per cent by 1996. About 250 construction jobs will be
created.
