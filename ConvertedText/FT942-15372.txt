FT  15 APR 94 / Observer: Fly me, I'm early


Even Singapore's highly disciplined workers are not immune to taking the
occasional unauthorised day off. Singapore International Airlines has become
so concerned about absenteeism that it's introduced a demerit system for
offenders. SIA says numbers reporting sick on the eve of public holidays and
holidays had risen to 'unrealistic levels'.
Thus, in an airline version of the soccer card system, errant staff will be
penalised two points for a second such offence and four points for third or
fourth offences. Demerit points are also given for other disciplinary
lapses, like arriving late for a flight or being without a valid passport.
If staff accumulate eight or more points in a two-year period, they will be
hauled up before an official inquiry. The only surprise is that SIA hasn't
introduced the system for naughty passengers too.
