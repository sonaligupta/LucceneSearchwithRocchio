FT  14 APR 94 / Rail union votes against strike


The threat of a national rail strike faded last night with the announcement
that members of RMT, the main rail union, had voted by 11,336 to 10,193
against the union executive's strike call in a postal ballot. The turnout
was 45 per cent.
The ballot was held over job security and redeployment on the newly
privatised system.
