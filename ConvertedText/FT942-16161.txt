FT  12 APR 94 / People: Finance moves


Hong Kong has been the world's most profitable banking market in the past
year; Ian Wilson is therefore taking over one of the most enviable posts in
a British bank by becoming Standard Chartered's general manager for Hong
Kong and China.
Wilson, 52, succeeds Tony Nicolle, the former Hong Kong banking commissioner
who was appointed to oversee Standard Chartered in the colony in 1991 - when
it was in a troubled period - by Rodney Galpin, its former chairman.
Nicolle, 59, is retiring from Standard Chartered. Wilson has had a long
career with the bank, joining in 1961 and serving in India, Singapore, the
US, South Korea and Malaysia before becoming chief executive Hong Kong in
1991.
Since September 1992 he has been general manager for the Middle East and
Asia.
