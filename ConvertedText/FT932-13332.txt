FT  23 APR 93 / International Company News: BankAmerica income up 60%


   By ALAN FRIEDMAN


BANKAMERICA Corporation, which last year completed its takeover of the
troubled Security Pacific bank, yesterday reported a 60 per cent jump in its
first-quarter 1993 net income, to Dollars 484m, or Dollars 1.19 per share.
Mr Richard Rosenberg, chairman, said the results reflected the continuing
effects of weakness in the California economy and other key markets.
'These economic weaknesses remain a source of concern. However, improvements
in the more controllable aspects of our business, such as expenses and
credit quality, have helped to mitigate the effects of the soft economy,' he
explained.
The bank underscored the fact that its non-performing assets and the size of
assets to be disposed of declined during the first three months of 1993.
Non-performing assets declined by Dollars 205m in the quarter. Assets
pending disposal declined by Dollars 1.7bn to Dollars 2.59bn.
Net credit losses in the quarter were Dollars 303m, down from Dollars 501m
in the fourth quarter of 1992, but higher than the Dollars 219m of the first
quarter of last year. Bad debt provisions were Dollars 235m, against Dollars
230m a year ago.
Net interest income for the quarter was Dollars 1.843bn, down by 5 per cent
from the last quarter of 1992, but much improved on the Dollars 1.231bn of a
year ago - before the merger with Security Pacific.
Non-interest income was Dollars 1.089bn in the quarter, 8 per cent higher
than the previous quarter and nearly twice the Dollars 596m of a year ago.
BankAmerica's shares closed was Dollars  5/8 lower at Dollars 48 1/2 in New
York.
Bank of Boston reported a first-quarter Dollars 67m net profit, against
Dollars 57m. Non-performing assets were Dollars 597m, down 53 per cent on
last year.
