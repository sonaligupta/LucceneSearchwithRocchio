FT  26 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Difficult trading keeps Brown & Tawse loss
little changed at Pounds 1m


   By ANGUS FOSTER


BROWN & Tawse, the steel and pipes distributor, yesterday announced a second
successive year of losses and cut dividends.
The company reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 975,000 in the year to March
31, a slight improvement from losses of Pounds 1.17m a year ago.
But operating profits fell from Pounds 4.13m to Pounds 1.36m and Mr Gil
Black, chairman, said trading remains difficult.
The proposed final dividend is being cut to 1.85p (2.85p) to make a total of
4.7p (5.7p). The shares fell 5p to 61p.
Turnover fell to Pounds 139.4m (Pounds 166.1m) as the company's main
construction and industrial markets were affected by recession.
This followed a decline at the interim stage when turnover fell to Pounds
72.3m (Pounds 90.8m) and a loss of Pounds 181,000 was announced (Pounds
2.17m profit).
Losses from bad debts increased to Pounds 1.2m (Pounds 730,000). There were
exceptional losses of Pounds 184,000 from rationalisations, net of a Pounds
614,000 exceptional gain on a pension cost adjustments.
Brown & Tawse Plant, a distributor of rock breakers, is being closed,
leading to exceptional provisions of Pounds 425,000.
The company further reduced employees from 1,423 to 1,295. Stocks fell by
Pounds 6m to Pounds 22.5m while net borrowings fell to Pounds 16.1m (Pounds
19.5m), taking gearing down to 35 per cent (42 per cent).
Mr Black announced the appointment of Richard Wilson as chief executive,
following the resignation of Mr Keith Rae last year. Mr Wilson, chairman,
GKN Building Services Division, joins Brown & Tawse in October.
The loss per share deteriorated to 2.7p (0.7p). There was a retained loss of
Pounds 2.39m (Pounds 2.08m).
COMMENT
Mr Wilson's departure from GKN to join Brown & Tawse would appear brave. He
is joining a company which despite two years of thorough cost cutting has
failed to make a profit after interest costs since 1990. Although many of
the woes can be blamed on recession, the company's heavy exposure to
construction suggests recovery is far from imminent.
With most of the obvious costs taken out, Mr Wilson will presumably be
looking a little deeper, perhaps to find a cheaper way to run the company's
distribution network and reduce operating costs.
Forecasts for this year suggest another small loss or perhaps break even.
The dividend yield is now close to 10 per cent, suggesting another cut
cannot be ruled out.
