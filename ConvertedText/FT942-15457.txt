FT  15 APR 94 / Seoul in US talks on North's N-facilities


   By JOHN BURTON


   SEOUL


The US and South Korea will begin talks tomorrow in Seoul on efforts to
renew negotiations with North Korea, concerning inspections of its nuclear
facilities.
The discussions with South Korea over the weekend will involve Mr William
Perry, US defence secretary, and Mr Robert Gallucci, a senior State
Department official recently appointed to head a US policy group on Korea.
A key issue will be whether to drop a demand that North Korea must exchange
special envoys with South Korea before the US agrees to hold another round
of high-level talks with Pyongyang.
North Korea maintains the dispute can be solved through negotiations with
the US on possible diplomatic recognition, in exchange for opening its
nuclear sites to inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency.
But its refusal to accept a special envoy from the South, who would discuss
inter-Korean nuclear inspections, has blocked talks with the US.
Seoul believes inter-Korean talks must be held in parallel to US-North
Korean negotiations, but there have been recent suggestions in Seoul that
the demand may be abandoned temporarily to improve the chances for a
diplomatic settlement.
The IAEA has warned it may declare North Korea in violation of nuclear
safeguards in early May, if Pyongyang continues to refuse full nuclear
inspections by the UN agency.
The IAEA is expected to seek new talks with North Korea next week on
preparations for inspections, which were halted in mid-March.
The United Nations Security Council recently approved a statement urging
North Korea to resume acceptance of inspections.
A second issue will be the schedule for the staging of the Team Spirit
military exercise by the US in South Korea this year. Both countries regard
Team Spirit as a diplomatic means to press North Korea into allowing
inspections, but early resumption of the exercise might derail chances for
renewed talks with Pyongyang.
North Korea has repeatedly condemned Team Spirit as a rehearsal for an
attack on the country. The exercise is expected for the second half of the
year if no progress is achieved on the nuclear dispute.
Mr Perry will also discuss the strengthening of US forces in South Korea
against a possible surprise invasion by the North. Defence preparations
would include deployment of US Patriot missiles to destroy North Korean Scud
missiles and increased stockpiling of other military equipment.
