FT  21 DEC 92 / International Company News: Thai Airways bond issue to
purchase new aircraft


   By VICTOR MALLET


THAI Airways International intends to issue Y20bn (Pounds 105.8m) of Samurai
bonds in 1993 or early 1994 and to seek Dollars 144m (Pounds 94.7m) in loan
guarantees from the US Eximbank to finance the purchase of new aircraft, the
company said.
According to Thai's firm order delivery plan, four new aircraft are due to
be delivered in calendar 1993 - two Airbus A300-600R, one Boeing 747-400 and
one Boeing 737-400.
A total of 25 new aircraft with firm orders are scheduled for delivery
before the end of 1997.
Thai said its investment budget for the current fiscal year, ending
September 30 1993 was Bt10bn, only a third of last year's figure.
Since the civilian government wrested control of Thai from the air force in
September, the new management has begun to rationalise the fleet, retiring
its DC-10 and BAe146 aircraft and cutting seat-kilometres flown by four per
cent.
The state sold 7 per cent of Thai to the public earlier this year, and hopes
to sell another 14 per cent when stock market conditions are favourable. The
shares are currently languishing below the 60-baht initial public offering
price.
