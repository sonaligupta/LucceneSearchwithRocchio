   ROME


THE new Italian government, headed by Mr Giulio Andreotti, yesterday won a
vote of confidence in parliament, despite the small Republican party voting
against, writes Haig Simonian in Rome.
The Republicans, part of the coalition ruling Italy since 1983, had decided
to withdraw from Mr Andreotti's new government after a clash with the
premier over cabinet posts.
