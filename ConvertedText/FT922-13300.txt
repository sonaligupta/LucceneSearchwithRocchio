FT  13 APR 92 / Construction Contracts: Accommodation for Reading students


Extra housing for Reading University students will be available next year
following the award of a Pounds 6.2m contract to LAING WESSEX.
Following the tendering process, Reading University has selected the company
to build 346 study bedrooms at the Sherfield halls of residence in
Northcourt Avenue.
They will house students who would otherwise be renting accommodation in
nearby areas of Reading.
Work will involve constructing a three-storey block and two part three and
part two-storey buildings.
The contract also provides for a community building, four staff houses,
roads and landscaping.
Designed by architects Broadway Malyan, the project is due for completion in
June 1993.
