FT  23 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading


   By JOEL KIBAZO


THE BETTER than forecast unemployment figures, together with the unexpected
reduction in German interest rates, boosted trading activity in the
derivatives sector, writes Joel Kibazo.
It was a subdued opening in the futures as the June contract on the FT-SE
100 Index started trading at 2,892. Dealing remained uneventful until the
11.30am release of the pleasing unemployment figures. This sent June
advancing to the day's high of 2,900, the first time the contract has traded
at that level in several sessions.
However, this proved a resistance point and the contract came off the top on
profit-taking and a feeling that a cut in German rates was unlikely.
June drifted to the day's low of 2,877 over the lunchtime period. The
announcement of a German rate reduction from the Bundesbank took dealers by
surprise and led to renewed buying of the contract.
It ended at 2,893, up 5 from the previous close and 6 points above its
estimated fair value premium to cash of around 7. Volume came to 9,539 lots.
The traded options were also busy and saw total turnover of 31,052
contracts. Business in the FT-SE 100 option amounted to 6,298 lots, although
that in the Euro FT-SE option was more modest at 1,249.
Hanson was the busiest stock option with 5,158 contracts transacted,
followed by Land Securities with 2,010.
