FT  22 JUL 93 / International Company News: Charge batters Dow drug
subsidiary


   By PAUL ABRAHAMS


MARION Merrell Dow, the pharmaceuticals group 70 per cent-owned by Dow, the
large US chemicals company, yesterday reported earnings down 85 per cent, to
Dollars 29m from Dollars 197m, for the second quarter to 30 June.
The company was hit by a special Dollars 180m restructuring charge for its
US business. It was also affected by falling sales of its leading medicines.
Without the special charge, net income would have been down 20 per cent at
Dollars 158m, according to the company. Mr Fred Lyons, president and chief
executive, pointed out that the results were better than during the first
quarter.
Turnover for the quarter fell 17 per cent to Dollars 750m from Dollars 908m.
Sales of the heart drug Cardizem, its best-selling medicine, dropped 9 per
cent to Dollars 210m, after US patents expired last year. However, its new
once-a-day Cardizem CD generated sales of Dollars 125m, up 166 per cent.
Seldane, an anti-histamine, generated sales down 11 per cent, from Dollars
296m to Dollars 263m. Sales of Nicoderm, the smoking cessation patch, fell
71 per cent to Dollars 24m against last year's figure. Sales of Nicorette
gum dropped 60 per cent to Dollars 40m.
Research and development spending for the quarter fell from Dollars 125m to
Dollars 115m, while sales, general and administrative spending dropped from
Dollars 286m to Dollars 270m.
Earnings per share fell from 70 cents to 10 cents.
Johnson & Johnson, the US pharmaceuticals and consumer group, posted
second-quarter earnings up 9.5 per cent, to Dollars 495m from Dollars 452m.
Turnover increased 3.8 per cent to Dollars 3.54bn from Dollars 3.41bn.
However Mr Ralph Larsen, chairman and chief executive, said sales growth had
been slowed by weak economies in several markets, the strength of the
dollar, and healthcare reforms in several important international markets.
The consumer division's sales rose 1.6 per cent to Dollars 1.18bn from
Dollars 1.17bn.
Domestic turnover rose 1.2 per cent to Dollars 608m from Dollars 601m.
Turnover at the pharmaceuticals division rose 3.3 per cent to Dollars 1.12bn
from Dollars 1.1bn. In the US, it increased 9.5 per cent to Dollars 428m,
due to the introduction of new products such as Procrit, a treatment for
anaemia, and Leustatin, a medicine for hairy cell leukaemia.
These gains were offset by a decline in sales of Hismanal, an
anti-histamine. Non-US sales fell to Dollars 691m from Dollars 692m because
of healthcare reforms.
Sales of the professional division, which markets wound products, medical
equipment and dental and ophthalmic products, increased 6.3 per cent to
Dollars 1.24bn, from Dollars 1.17bn.
Earnings per share rose 10.3 per cent to 75 cents, from 68 cents.
