FT  22 JUL 94 / Sinn Fein response 'wins IRA backing'

The IRA military leadership has apparently endorsed proposals to be put to a
special delegate conference of its political wing Sinn Fein this weekend.
The party's definitive response to the Downing Street declaration is to be
made at the conference, to be held on this Sunday.
Meanwhile Mr Albert Reynolds, Irish prime minister, said last night that his
government 'would not just wait for peace', but would continue efforts to
find a solution. He told Fianna Fail party supporters: 'This government will
continue to work actively by whatever means are available to bring it about.
'That is why for many months we have been pursuing with the British
government, in parallel with the peace process and drawing from it,
agreement on a framework for a Northern settlement - a framework we hope to
agree by the early autumn.'
In yesterday's An Phoblacht, Sinn Fein's weekly newspaper, the IRA army
council said: 'We encourage Sinn Fein as it continues to strive for the
creation of a viable peace process.'
The IRA statement appears to be aimed at reassuring the conference that
there is a unity of purpose between the IRA army council and the Sinn Fein
leadership.
The IRA statement said it had 'a vested interest in securing peace' and that
it would maintain 'a positive and flexible attitude to developments in the
peace process'. It reiterated its adherence to 'republican objectives which
include the right to national self-determination'.
Downing Street responded brusquely to yesterday's statement, saying it did
not measure up to a permanent cessation of violence.
The main issue emerging from the conference will be whether there is any
statement or hint that the IRA should suspend its military operations to
allow space for further political developments.
