FT  22 JUL 94 / Arts: Today's Television


   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY


Today's concert in the BBC Proms 1994 season is a repeat of the programme in
which Bernard Haitink made his Prom debut 30 years ago. He conducts the BBC
Symphony Orchestra in Beethoven's Coriolan overture, Mozart's Sinfonia
Concertante (Thomas Zehetmair violin, Tabea Zimmermann viola) and Bruckner's
immense 7th symphony (7.30 Radio 3). In The Jupiter Collision Carolyn and
Gene Shoemaker and David Levy, who gave their names to the comet due to hit
Jupiter last weekend, assess the effects of the collision (8.00 BBC2).
Michael Moore is the American who made the programme about trying to
interview the chairman of General Motors. Now he begins a series, Michael
Moore's TV Nation, which goes further afield. He begins (9.30 BBC2) by
meeting Serbian and Croatian diplomats to settle 'this whole war thing'.
Channel 4 is running repeats of The Golden Girls but not stating whether
they will be shown in order (9.30). BBC2 begins Woodstock Diary a three-part
programme marking the 25th anniversary of the famous rock happening (11.15).
