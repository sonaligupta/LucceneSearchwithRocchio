FT  22 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Late strength in dollar helps
underpin bourses


The Bundesbank's decision not to make any movement on the discount and
Lombard rates should have come as no surprise to the markets and, in the
event, most of them remained resilient. There was some satisfaction at the
announcement that the repo rate was fixed for the coming four weeks, but the
main cause for late strength was attributed to the rise in the dollar.
FRANKFURT saw the Dax index fall 25.35, or 1.1 per cent, to 2,113.30 in the
official session, which closed before the Buba went public.
In later trading there was a marked improvement as the index settled at
2,119.94. Turnover amounted to DM5.6bn.
BZW's global strategist, Mr Michael Hughes, said that with evidence that
money supply growth was coming under control he was now reversing his
recommendation for German bonds and equities.
Consequently, BZW had upgraded bonds to neutral from aggressively
underweight and downgraded equities from neutral to underweight. 'The
outperformance of German equities over bonds was facilitated by excess
liquidity coming into the German economy,' he said. 'As this withdraws we
would expect the relative performance to change.'
The banking sector was pressured yesterday as some investors became nervous
ahead of results due from Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank next week, with
reports that they could be disappointing. Deutsche recovered in Ibis
trading: having closed at DM721, the stock was finally a net DM8.50 off at
DM726. The story was repeated at Commerzbank, DM337.50 in the official and
down DM1.30 at DM338.90 in the Ibis.
ZURICH continued its recovery, with the day's half-year figures from Sulzer
helping to consolidate a more positive view of the corporate outlook. The
SMI index advanced 17.1 to 2,579.4.
Sulzer appreciated SFr20 to SFr905, with news that orders in the first six
months of 1994 increased by 3 per cent in Swiss francs and 6.5 per cent in
local currency terms proving better than some analysts had expected.
Nestle picked up a further SFr26 to SFr1,170 in continued response to its
better than expected first-half figures earlier in the week. The shares have
risen 6 per cent over the last two sessions.
Roche certificates continued their improvement, adding SFr50 at SFr5,400.
Their slide last week after disappointing figures had unsettled investors
and led the market lower.
Elsewhere, Brown Boveri, which posted strong gains earlier in the week, saw
profit-taking which left the shares SFr12 lower at SFr1,122.
AMSTERDAM moved closer once again to breaking through the 400 mark, the AEX
index finishing up 1.24 at 399.04.
DSM and Akzo made good gains, Fl 4.60 and Fl 2.60 respectively, to Fl 141.30
and Fl 205.20. Kleinwort Benson favours the chemicals sector, giving it a 36
per cent overweight holding in its model portfolio, although this is
substantially less than the 76 per cent holding it favours for consumer
goods, which includes both Polygram and Philips.
The investment bank said that these weightings reflected the 'cyclical bias
which we emphasise as being key for exposure to the European economic
recovery'.
PARIS recovered its balance after earlier declines, helped by late strength
in futures. The CAC-40 index added 10.06, or 0.5 per cent, at 2,053.78,
having dropped to a day's low of 2,023.11. Turnover was FFr4bn.
Eurotunnel claimed a 2.7 per cent rise, the shares ending 65 centimes up at
FFr24.55 on news that a US investment fund had lifted its stake.
Michelin, up FFr1 at FFr254, has been upgraded to 'buy' by James Capel,
which raised its forecasts, based on the view that new products were
performing well.
MILAN shrugged off the day's political tensions and edged ahead as it
awaited further budget details from a cabinet meeting after the market
closed. The Comit index rose 3.61 to 720.11.
Telecommunications stocks overcame early hesitancy which followed comments
by Mr Lamberto Dini, the treasury minister, who said there was no fixed
timetable for their privatisation. Stet closed L65 higher at L5,545, while
Sip was L75 ahead at L4,560.
STOCKHOLM moved very slightly lower on profit-taking following rises over
the last 10 sessions. The Affarsvarlden general index eased 0.1 to 1,445.2.
The forestry sector continued to outperform as rumours of further increases
in pulp and paper prices resurfaced. Stora moved ahead SKr4 to SKr400, while
MoDo added SKr5 at SKr345.
MADRID was unable to make any headway, the general index softening 0.06 to
304.34.
Banco Bilbao Vizcaya rose Pta45, or 1.6 per cent, to Pta2,950. On Wednesday,
the bank announced a 17.2 per cent fall in first-half pre-tax profits, but
analysts said the result did not look so bad if losses in trading operations
were excluded.
