FT  25 AUG 92 / FBI thwarts Jardine share fraud

   HONG KONG


THE US Federal Bureau of Investigation has thwarted a HKDollars 200m (Pounds
13.4m) attempt to sell forged share certificates of Jardine Matheson
Holdings, one of Hong Kong's leading companies.
Jardine officials said they were informed late last week of an attempt to
pass nearly 3.8m of the company's shares. Both the Hong Kong and London
stock exchanges were informed.
The number of arrests in the US is unknown.
Mr Neil McNamara, Jardine's company secretary, said the Hong Kong police had
told him the FBI was confident all forged share certificates had been
recovered.
Mr McNamara pointed out, however, that the forged scrip  - 110,000
certificates in denominations of 30,000, 35,000 and 40,000 shares  - was
untradeable in the form sold to the FBI.
Jardine's shares are trade-able only in lots of 400 shares. Anyone trying to
sell the forgeries through the stock market would have had to present them
to the company's registrar for conversion. They would then have been
rejected, Mr McNamara said.
