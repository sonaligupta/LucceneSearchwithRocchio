FT  18 APR 94 / World Bond Markets: New York


   By MARTIN DICKSON


The US credit markets are likely to be dominated this week by continued
speculation over how rapidly, and by how much, the Federal Reserve will move
to tighten monetary policy again.
There is a general expectation that the Fed will raise the Fed Funds rate
from its current 3.5 per cent on May 17, at the next meeting of its
policy-making Open Market Committee. Suggestions that it might move before
then, however, have had an unsettling effect on the markets in recent days.
Treasury securities ended Friday mixed in sluggish trading after a
front-page report in the New York Times said that the Fed was sending
signals of another increase in short-term rates.
Since the market already knew this was the Fed's general intention, analysts
wondered whether the prominence of the story indicated an earlier than
expected rise.
However, the market took some comfort from industrial production and
capacity utilisation figures for March, which came in as expected, and the
benchmark 30-year Treasury issue closed the day unchanged, with a yield of
7.28, up from 7.25 the previous Friday.
This week the market faces statistics on the trade balance on Tuesday,
housing starts on Wednesday and the Federal Budget on Thursday.
