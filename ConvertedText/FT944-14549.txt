FT  22 OCT 94 / Ulster Peace Process: Overall timing remains in doubt


   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN


The prospect of exploratory talks with Sinn Fein starting before the 'year
is out' is about the only concrete date in Mr John Major's speech to the
Institute of Directors in Belfast yesterday. The timetable from here is hard
to predict.
Mr Major and his Irish counterpart Mr Albert Reynolds are due to meet at
Chequers on Monday to inject new momentum into the peace process. The Irish
government in particular is keen to press ahead, and bring Sinn Fein into
the democratic fold, concerned that a delay could play into the hands of
hardliners in the movement opposed to the ceasefire.
Mr Reynolds expects to have his cross party Forum for Peace and
Reconciliation under way at the end of the next week. One view in Dublin is
that the forum may turn out to be a useful halfway house for Sinn Fein, in
its spell of democratic quarantine, while the painstaking verification of
the ceasefire and negotiation over surrender of IRA arms continues.
The next crucial date will be the publication of the framework document,
which will seek to outline what the Northern Ireland Office called the
'shared understanding on the elements of a settlement that is likely to
receive widespread acceptance by the people of Northern Ireland'. Officials
hope it can be concluded by the year end, although Mr Dick Spring, the Irish
foreign minister, said yesterday there were still differences on difficult
constitutional issues.
The forum is expected to sit through to the autumn next year. A UK general
election is due before summer 1996. If there is a change of Northern Ireland
secretary beforehand, that could delay the process for six months. With
local elections in Northern Ireland in the meantime, one view is that
substantive talks involving the British government and Sinn Fein may not
take place before autumn 1997.
