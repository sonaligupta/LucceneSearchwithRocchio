FT  29 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Pathfinder puts Pounds 30m price tag on
Lilliput


   By DAVID BLACKWELL


LILLIPUT GROUP, the Cumbria-based manufacturer of miniature hand painted
cottages, is expected to have a market capitalisation of more than Pounds
30m when it is floated next month.
The flotation is expected to raise about Pounds 20m, made up of Pounds 3m of
new money and Pounds 17m for the existing shareholders.
The pathfinder prospectus, published yesterday, said Pounds 1.5m of the new
money would be used to redeem preference and deferred shares. After Pounds
500,000 of expenses, about Pounds 1m would be left to fund future growth.
Mr John Russell, chairman and chief executive, said the company was likely
to report operating profits of close to Pounds 3m in the year to January 2.
Last year operating profit was Pounds 2.13m on turnover of Pounds 13.6m.
Lilliput was founded by Mr David Tate, now the technical director, in 1982.
It ran into difficulties through diversification, and in 1990 was rescued
with Pounds 1.2m of venture capital.
North of England Ventures and investors headed by Lazard Ventures own 50 per
cent of the company, Mr Tate and his family 29.9 per cent, other directors
15 per cent and other investors 6 per cent.
The two venture capital groups are expected to realise Pounds 8m from the
flotation and retain a 20 to 25 per cent stake. Mr Tate will have 10 per
cent of the company and realise Pounds 5.5m. Other directors will keep a 6
per cent stake.
