FT  11 APR 94 / World Bond Markets: New York


   By RICHARD TOMKINS


Investors thumbed their collective nose at market trends last week and
lifted bond prices for three consecutive days: but on Friday, the rally
broke down as nervousness about this week's barrage of economic data set in.
The fear is that data pointing to inflationary pressures will provide the
Federal Open Market Committee with an excuse to increase interest rates.
Salomon Brothers predicts that, whether in one step or two, the committee is
poised to push the funds rate from 3.5 per cent to 4 per cent on or before
its May 17 meeting.
On Tuesday, the barrage will start quietly if the producer price index for
March shows the expected increase of just 0.2 per cent. But Wednesday will
be lively if the March increase in consumer prices is greater than
February's 0.3 per cent, and there could be worries about the likely
increase in retail sales of 1 per cent or more.
Thursday brings the figures for inventories held by manufacturers,
wholesalers and retailers, with analysts predicting increases ranging from
0.2 per cent to 0.4 per cent. The week could end with another busy day's
trading on Friday if, as expected, figures for industrial output show that
the overall operating rate rose to 83.7 per cent in March, the highest since
June 1989.
