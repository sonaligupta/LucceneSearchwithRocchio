FT  20 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Kunick drops to Pounds 5.9m loss


   By PEGGY HOLLINGER


KUNICK, the amusement machine and nursing homes group, plunged into the red
in the first half as Pounds 6.2m in property write-downs and restructuring
charges wiped out depressed trading profits.
Pre-tax losses, after the exceptional charges, came to Pounds 5.9m for the
six months to March 31, compared with a profit of Pounds 5.2m last time.
Turnover rose marginally to Pounds 58m.
Mr Christopher Burnett, who is replacing Mr Russell Smith as chairman, said
the bulk of losses occurred in the amusement machine operation, where the UK
market declined by about 15 per cent. Operating profits fell from Pounds
4.7m to Pounds 500,000.
The nursing care side reported a 50 per cent increase in operating profits
to Pounds 1.2m.
Debt of Pounds 45m represented 64 per cent of shareholders' funds.
There is no interim dividend.
COMMENT
The company has been left well and truly reeling by the triple whammy of
recession, fruit machine stake increases and fewer pubs following the
intervention of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. So much so, that
Kunick has even had to offer the brewers a hefty Pounds 5.5m up front to
allow its machines through the door and preserve some sort of steady,
longer-term business. Whether it can survive the impact of recent trials
depends on several factors: property disposals, rapid cost-cutting, and the
long-awaited economic upturn. The market appears to be pessimistic and the
shares - which were 38p in September - fell 3p last night to close at 6 1/4
p. Certainly, the fact that analysts are betting on Kunick having to
negotiate new interest covenants with bankers does not offer comfort.
Forecasts are for losses of about Pounds 4.8m after the exceptionals.
