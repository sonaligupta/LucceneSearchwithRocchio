FT  04 AUG 92 / President of Hesse central bank dies


   By ANDREW FISHER


   FRANKFURT


MR Karl Thomas, one of the most experienced and influential members of the
Bundesbank's policy-making council, died suddenly at the weekend.
Mr Thomas, 63, was also president of the regional central bank of Hesse, the
German state which includes the banking centre of Frankfurt.
He had been head of the regional central bank for only 2 1/2 years of his
eight-year term but was an energetic supporter of efforts to promote
Frankfurt as the site of the European central bank and to develop its
strength as a financial centre.
He supported reforms, such as a new supervisory body for the Frankfurt Stock
Exchange, aimed at improving the city's financial status in competition with
other European centres and preventing trading scandals like those which
surfaced last year.
Mr Thomas, born in Chemnitz in Saxony in east Germany, also argued strongly
in Bonn for reforms to the Bundesbank's structure which are now being
implemented and which will make the council less unwieldy.
Unlike some of the other regional central bank heads who have a political
background, Mr Thomas came from the ranks of the Bundesbank, where he had
spent about 40 years after studying economics in Berlin. He became head of
the credit department, an important part of the central bank's operations.
He had backed the Bundesbank's efforts to damp down inflation and curb money
supply growth, including the latest interest rate rises.
Mr Thomas's successor as president of the central bank of Hesse, and thus as
a member of the Bundesbank council, will be chosen by the state government
in Wiesbaden in conjunction with the upper house of the Bonn parliament.
