FT  15 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Success of cider brands helps Bulmer to
Pounds 14m


   By RODERICK ORAM, Consumer Industries Editor


Cider brands of HP Bulmer Holdings enjoyed faster growth than the market as
whole, allowing the Hereford-based producer to report a sharp jump in
underlying interim profits.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to October 28 increased to Pounds 14.3m.
The year ago figure of Pounds 2.66m was depressed by a Pounds 9.33m charge
for disposing of a lossmaking business.
Underlying profits rose 19 per cent, while operating profits from continuing
operations grew 5 per cent to Pounds 15.5m.
Turnover slipped to Pounds 130m (Pounds 139.5m) but excluding disposals
there was a 7 per cent rise.
Capital investment, cost cutting, and brand developments would spur further
progress, Mr Esmond Bulmer, chairman, said.
Bulmer, the market leader, introduced three new products yesterday to
capitalise on the trend to premium ciders: Scrumpy Jack Old Hazy, a cask
conditioned cloudy cider, Strongbow Ice, the first ice cider, and Strongbow
Lemon White, a flavoured cider for Australia.
The interim dividend is raised to 4.25p (4p).
Earnings per share of 17.31p compared with losses of 1.42p including
exceptionals or earnings of 14.94p before.
Bulmer said the UK cider market grew by 8 per cent to 95.5m gallons in the
year to September. On-trade expanded by 5 per cent, while Bulmer's share
rose 8 per cent to 50.1 per cent. The off-trade increased by 12 per cent,
with Bulmer growing by more than 20 per cent in the premium and economy
sectors, but slipping in private label and edging ahead in mainstream
brands.
Mr John Rudgard, chief executive, said Bulmer hoped to complete soon
agreements with Heineken in the Netherlands and Interbrew in Belgium to
distribute its ciders to the on-trade in those countries.
Bulmer has a continental toe-hold through Stassen, Belgium's leading cider
maker, which it bought in 1992.
Further investment in Stassen should begin to show results this year,
although profits dipped in the first half, the company said.
