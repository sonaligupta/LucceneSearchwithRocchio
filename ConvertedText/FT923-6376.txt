FT  25 AUG 92 / Letter: Bottom holds on the Tokyo exchange


   From Mr HENRY SCOTT-STOKES


Sir, When the Tokyo Stock Exchange was last in difficult straits 27 years
ago, the method of support was direct intervention by the Bank of Japan.
This time, a range of indirect options have been preferred. The result has
been similar: the building in of a bottom. Said bottom was put in place by
Governor Yasushi Mieno of the BOJ with a few words to the press after the
market closed last Wednesday.
The market is not quite what Anglo-Saxons think stock markets ought to be.
It looks over-valued judging by one basic criterion  - the price/earnings
ratio  - but only if one makes no adjustment for cross-shareholdings. The
p/e ratios cited by Peter Martin ('Good buys, but a risky business', August
22-23) for Toyota Motor and others have to be reduced to almost half the
quoted levels, if one judges by the work of long-time resident pundits.
I suspect Mr Mieno's bottom will hold. As to individual stock quotations,
Martin perhaps stretched a point when he quoted some unidentified luminary
here as stating that 'there is no discipline of valuation in the (Tokyo)
market'. If so, how would one explain that certain Western fund managers
have done well over years, consistently so, while others have crumbled?
Indiscipline?
