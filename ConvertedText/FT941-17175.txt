FT  06 JAN 94 / US calls on Japan to lift economy


   By GEORGE GRAHAM


The US yesterday renewed its call for the Japanese government to stimulate
the country's economy, and warned it not to hope for a weaker yen to pull it
out of recession.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, said Japan still had a huge
trade surplus, and could not look to the US and other countries to make up
for slack domestic demand.
'Allowing the yen to slide is not an acceptable way out of recession for
Japan,' Mr Bentsen said in a speech yesterday at the Brookings Institution,
a Washington think-tank.
Although foreign exchange traders had been waiting for Mr Bentsen's speech,
the yen strengthened only modestly on his remarks.
Mr Bentsen said he wanted to see economic policies that would stimulate
demand in Japan and help Japanese consumers. 'I think if they do that the
yen will reflect it,' he added.
Presenting an overview of the Clinton administration's economic policies, Mr
Bentsen expressed confidence that the steps already taken to reduce the US
federal budget deficit would bring more economic good news in 1994.
Growth had accelerated steadily throughout 1993, and in the fourth quarter
should reach between 4 and 5 per cent, he said, while the inflation rate of
2.8 per cent was as low as it had been for years.
'This year I'd like to see us achieve a solid 3 per cent real growth - and
hold inflation to approximately 3 per cent. That should allow interest rates
to remain relatively low and reduce further the unemployment rate,' Mr
Bentsen said.
Noting that, like millions of US homeowners, he had refinanced his own
mortgage last year to take advantage of lower interest rates, Mr Bentsen
said he had selected an adjustable rate mortgage, 'which means I'm
optimistic about what's going to happen to interest rates.'
Although he said the budget deficit for the 1995 fiscal year, starting
October 1, would be only about Dollars 190bn, much lower than the
administration had earlier forecast, Mr Bentsen warned that the budget would
be very tight.
Nine out of 14 cabinet departments would see a cut in their budgets, due to
be announced on February 7, if favoured programmes categorised as investment
are excluded.
Further evidence of the strength of the US economy in the fourth quarter of
1993 came yesterday when the commerce department announced new orders for
manufactured goods rose by 1.4 per cent in November, the fourth consecutive
month of rising orders.
