FT  13 NOV 92 / SA corruption accusations rise


   By REUTER


   CAPE TOWN


South African president FW de Klerk's white government has reeled under
renewed revelations of chaos and corruption in the black homelands that were
cornerstones of apartheid, Reuter reports from Cape Town.
Former magistrate Burt Parsons said in a nine-volume report to de Klerk
yesterday that white-led police in the KwaNdebele homeland believed their
primary role was to prop up a black administration sympathetic to Pretoria.
Exposing apartheid excesses including the murder and detention without trial
of children as young as 11, Mr Parsons said: 'The evidence points ..to
serious, even extremely serious, offences ..by police officers.'
