FT  02 NOV 93 / Goodison backs financial regulator


SIR NICHOLAS GOODISON, president of the British Bankers' Association and TSB
group chairman, yesterday supported the establishment of the Personal
Investment Authority, the proposed self-regulating body for retail financial
services.
Sir Nicholas argued that improvements in regulation need not await the
possibility of new legislation to revise the Financial Services Act.
He also renewed his call for the Bank of England to lose its responsibility
for consumer protection and to acquire responsibility for the capital
adequacy of non-banking institutions.
