FT  30 OCT 93 / Canary discharged with seven short words


   By ANDREW JACK


ONE OF THE most complex administrations under UK insolvency law ended
successfully yesterday in the High Court in London with just seven words
from the Chancery vice-chancellor, Sir Donald Nicholls.
'I approve the discharge with immediate effect,' he said after a 35-minute
presentation on behalf of the administrators by Mr Jonathan Mance, QC.
Court approval was the final step required 28 days after creditors voted for
a voluntary arrangement after Canary Wharf first entered administration in
May last year.
It followed provisional approval on October 19 subject to there being no
objections or challenges to the plan.
It clears the way for payment of a first dividend to creditors by the end of
January next year. The administrators ultimately forecast total dividends of
15p.
This payment will go to an estimated 1,400 unsecured creditors who voted in
favour of the exit strategy from administration.
A further 25p in the pound will be paid as dividends to the 130 construction
trade creditors to provide warranties to them on work already done.
Yesterday's approval means that Sylvester Investments - named after the
cartoon cat that pursued Tweety Pie, the canary - will become the holding
company, with shares held by the 11 creditor banks.
Sylvester will control a separate vehicle called Canary Wharf Holdings,
which will in turn own Canary Wharf Limited, the operating company for the
Docklands development.
