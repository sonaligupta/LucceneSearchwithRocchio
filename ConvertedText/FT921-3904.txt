FT  12 MAR 92 / Letter: Britain's accountants display unique range of
background disciplines


   From Mr IAN R MCNEIL


Sir, Peter McGregor ('Britain's narrowly educated accountants trail the
international field', Letters, March 9) claims that accountants in Britain
are less well educated than elsewhere. His claim is based not on their
professional training, but on their secondary and higher education being too
little or too narrow. However, statistics for chartered accountants suggest
otherwise.
Since 1984, 90 per cent of our student entrants have been graduates, and in
the most recent intakes, 55 per cent of those graduates had upper second or
first-class honours degrees. Their degrees cover a wide range of
disciplines. Far from giving up science subjects at about 14, as Mr McGregor
maintains, more than 30 per cent have degrees in sciences, mathematics and
engineering. Slightly less than 50 per cent have business degrees.
Many of our firms' recruiters deliberately seek broadly educated students,
whereas for accountants overseas, for example in Germany, Australia and the
US, the rigid pattern is for accountants first to take an accountancy degree
and only then to go on to professional training.
Perhaps as a consequence of the more broadly based British system,
accountancy is one of the few sectors of our economy in which we are
world-beaters.
I certainly believe that other sectors have much to learn from the
commitment of British accountancy firms to investing heavily in the
professional training of their people.
