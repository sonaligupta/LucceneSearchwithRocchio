FT  15 APR 94 / VCR deal averts clash on standards


   By ALAN CANE


A costly battle over the design of the next generation of video cassette
recorders has been averted by an agreement on technical standards between
the world's leading consumer electronics companies.
The accord, reached in Tokyo yesterday by the 50 members of the HD Digital
VCR Conference, is expected to head off a standards war of the kind that
marred the introduction of analogue video recorders.
Sony had led the way with its Betamax format, but eventually had to concede
defeat to JVC, which was more successful in persuading video film suppliers
to use its VHS standard.
Mr Andrew House of Sony, acting as spokesman for the conference, said in
Tokyo that digital technology would change the VCR industry 'in the same way
that digital has changed the music business by replacing vinyl records with
compact discs'.
Other members of the HD Digital VCR Conference include Matsushita and
Toshiba of Japan, Philips of the Netherlands and Thomson of France. The
computer companies IBM and Apple of the US are members because digital VCRs
can be used to store computer data.
The standards are for high-definition digital VCRs, which use the binary
digits ('bits') of computer language rather than analogue signals to record
images and sounds. Digital VCRs will give greatly improved picture quality
and make for cleaner tape copies.
Industry executives believe digital VCRs could be in the shops as early as
next year. They are expected, however, to be expensive, with some estimates
putting the cost of a machine at up to Dollars 3,000 (Pounds 2,055).
The new machines will use tapes about two-thirds the size of a conventional
VHS cassette with 4 1/2 hours recording time.
