FT  22 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei edges ahead as
Australia hits five-year high


   By EMIKO TERAZONO


   TOKYO


UNCERTAINTY over political events and a gloomy outlook for the economy
discouraged investors, and business was slow as the Nikkei average gained
marginal ground, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei finished 42.91 higher at 20,080.91 after a day's low of 19,972.60
and high of 20,117.71. After institutional investors and foreigners
rearranged their portfolios during the first 30 minutes of trading, the
index remained around the 20,000 level, in line with index-linked activity.
Volume totalled 250m shares, against 236m. Traders noted the absence of
public pension and insurance funds. Declines led rises by 523 to 420, with
220 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks edged up
1.69 to 1,636.32 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 0.44 to
1,244.39.
Weak economic figures suggested that while the economy has hit a bottom, the
wait for a rebound would be prolonged. A fund manager said that with the
economy moving in an 'L shape' it is unlikely that aggressive buying would
emerge in the short term.
Weak household spending figures indicated sluggish consumer confidence,
while the government's leading indicator fell below 50 per cent, the
boom-bust line, for the first time in four months.
Investors were also discouraged by reports that leading manufacturers,
including Toyota and electronics manufacturers, will lengthen their summer
holidays to curb output.
Stocks linked to East Japan Railway, which will have its shares listed on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange on October 26, were actively traded.
Advertising for the stock sale, by JR East and brokers, started yesterday.
Nippon Express, the parcel delivery company, rose Y10 to Y1,050 and Keisei
Electric Railway gained Y10 at Y1,260.
The lack of fresh news prompted speculative trading. Nikkatsu, the most
active issue of the day, firmed Y1 to Y20 and Nagase, a chemical maker, put
on Y20 at Y1,190 on rumours that a subsidiary was seeking to be listed.
Hazama, the construction group involved in several bribery scandals, lost
further ground, closing Y13 down at Y444.
Profit-taking depressed issues which had risen earlier on reports that DDI,
a telecommunications company, would apply for listing. Kyocera fell Y70 to
Y6,230 and Ushio retreated Y13 to Y950.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 50.97 to 22,175.59 in volume of 20.8m shares.
Roundup
PACIFIC Rim markets found their own reasons for a series of mostly strong
performances.
AUSTRALIAN shares finished at their highest level since October 1987, with
local demand spurred by hopes of a cut in interest rates, perhaps after the
release of inflation and trade figures next week.
The market was also supported by strong European and Asian demand for blue
chip issues, and the All Ordinaries index ended 12.4 higher at 1,818.5 in
turnover of ADollars 436.9m.
NEW ZEALAND advanced to a three-year high, with encouragement for equities
coming from the bond market and an opinion poll giving the ruling
conservative National party a seven-point lead over the opposition Labour
party, ahead of the election later this year. The NZSE-40 index closed
15.59, or 0.9 per cent, ahead at 1,729.50.
KUALA LUMPUR climbed 2.1 per cent to an all-time peak amid strong
institutional buying of blue chip stocks after the market's recent
correction. The composite index was finally 15.70 up at 761.60 following
late profit-taking that had limited gains after index-linked stocks had led
the surge.
MANILA posted a record close, with local dealing fuelled by gains made on
Wall Street by Philippine Long Distance Telephone.
The composite index surged 31.09 to 1,681.86 as PLDT added 35 pesos at 1,050
pesos.
SINGAPORE rebounded on renewed institutional buying of blue chips after news
that Singapore Telecom's flotation would be carried out in stages, freeing
up the market's near to medium-term liquidity.
The Straits Times Industrial index finished 31.33, or 1.7 per cent, stronger
at 1,805.67.
KARACHI was again higher after further comments by Mr Moeen Qureshi, the
caretaker prime minister, reiterating a continuation of liberal economic
policies. The KSE index advanced 13.42 to 1,320.33.
BOMBAY edged forward on renewed buying by speculators from other centres
such as Calcutta and Ahmedabad. The BSE index closed 20.66 up at 2,126.15.
HONG KONG saw an early rally run out of steam, leaving the Hang Seng index a
net 6.83 off at 6,839.98 in turnover that shrank to HKDollars 2.35bn.
Stock prices opened higher and the index climbed more than 40 points at one
stage in the morning as optimism about the Sino-British talks sparked
buying.
But the mood changed in the afternoon, following news that the US could take
action against China if it continued to sell missiles to Pakistan.
