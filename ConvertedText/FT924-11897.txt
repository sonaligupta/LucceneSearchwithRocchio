FT  23 OCT 92 / People: Sir John Quinton heralds new era at Wimpey


Sir Clifford Chetwood, chairman of Wimpey, is saying goodbye after 40 years
with the company.
Two years ago Sir Clifford (right) relinquished the dual posts of chief
executive and chairman and is now to be replaced as non-executive chairman
by Sir John Quinton (left) who stands down as chairman of Barclays Bank at
the end of this year.
It is the first time that Wimpey has gone outside the group for such a
senior appointment. Sir Clifford, who became chairman in 1981 and chief
executive a year later was groomed by Sir Godfrey Mitchell, the man who
turned Wimpey from a small west London stonemasons into the country's second
largest housebuilder.
Sir Godfrey, who as a young army captain acquired Wimpey in 1919, dominated
the group's management until his retirement more than half a century later.
By the time Sir Clifford took over, the management structure was generally
seen to be inadequate for such a large group. Financial arrangements had
been handled by Sir Godfrey - who was vehemently opposed to any borrowing -
and by two other directors.
Housebuilding in the UK had risen to account for a disproportionate amount
of the group's annual profits which left it vulnerable to a sharp decline in
the UK housing market.
Much of Sir Clifford's time was taken up in reorganising a group of separate
businesses run by 17 separate, largely autonomous, regional companies.
The task of turning such a large ship was always going to be difficult. Sir
Clifford's efforts were eventually frustrated by the collapse of the UK
residential and commercial property markets at the end of the 1980s.
The task of steering the group to better climes has fallen to Joe Dwyer,
chief executive, and to Sir John Quinton.
