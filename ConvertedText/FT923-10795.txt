FT  29 JUL 92 / Milosevic tightens his grip


   By LAURA SILBER

THE Serbian government is trying to push through a package of laws to
tighten President Slobodan Milosevic's grip on the republic.
The Socialist-controlled parliament yesterday debated a public order bill,
one of many written in secret and proposed to be passed 'urgently'.
Opposition deputies say under this law a Serbian citizen could be sentenced
to 20 days in prison for arguing in public. The other laws aimed at clamping
down on opposition range from the government's planned takeover of Politika,
the Belgrade daily, to a ban on rallies.
In a tactical manoeuvre to head off more unrest, the government said it
would amend its proposal to seize control of Politika. Several prominent
Socialists have joined opposition deputies in protest. Some 4,000 of the
company's workers have also threatened to strike. An important element in Mr
Milosevic's rise to power in 1987, Politika has become more independent in
recent months.
The government has also proposed a law which would give it effective control
over the universities. After most professors and rectors joined student
protests in Belgrade earlier this month, the government now claims the right
to appoint all university deans and rectors.
Mr Vuk Draskovic, leader of the opposition Serbian Renewal Movement, told
journalists the laws were a government attempt to take revenge for mass
public protests earlier this summer.
Opposition in Serbia has mounted after the UN imposed sanctions against
Yugoslavia, consisting only of Serbia and Montenegro, for backing Serb
fighters in Bosnia.
