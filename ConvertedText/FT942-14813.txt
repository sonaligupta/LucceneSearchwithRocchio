FT  19 APR 94 / Hopes rise over Malaysia trade ban


   By KIERAN COOKE


   KUALA LUMPUR


British defence companies seeking contracts in Malaysia hope that a ban on
business with companies from Britain will soon be lifted.
Malaysia announced the ban in late February in retaliation for unfavourable
British press reports - in particular about Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the prime
minister.
Malaysia has been a big buyer of British defence equipment in recent years,
and British companies form the largest contingent at a defence exhibition
which opens in Kuala Lumpur today.
General Borhan Ahmad, head of Malaysia's defence forces, said the country
would continue to use British-made equipment and hinted at further purchases
from the UK. 'We can't just throw our British equipment into the river and
forget about it,' he said.
Some British companies saw the general's comments as evidence of a shift in
Malaysian policy, but others were less hopeful.
They point out that Malaysia seems to be asking either for an apology from
The Sunday Times, which suggested that bribes had been offered to Dr
Mahathir in exchange for a government contract, or an official British
statement condemning the media's actions.
Some British ministers have criticised the British press, but Mr John Major,
the prime minister, has described the Malaysian move as 'not remotely
justified'.
Mr Najib Abdul Razak, Malaysian defence minister, has repeatedly said that
his country would not consider buying any more British defence equipment
until the row is settled. Dr Mahathir has said Malaysia will not change its
policy 'until the British press stops telling lies'.
Lord Cranborne, a junior defence minister, is due to meet Mr Najib in Kuala
Lumpur today.
