FT  05 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: More bonus rates announced - At a
Glance


Two more insurance companies have announced this year's bonus rates for
with-profits policies. Axa Equity & Law has increased terminal bonus rates
for policies of 20 years or more, but cut them for terms of less than 15
years.
This means that the maturity value of a with-profits endowment policy taken
out by a man aged 29 paying Pounds 30 a month would be Pounds 62,660 after
25 years, up 3.1 per cent from last year, but Pounds 6,478 after 10 years,
down 3.8 per cent.
Scottish Amicable is one of the few insurers to improve payouts on 10-year
policies. Reversionary bonuses on most of the company's policies are lower,
but maturity values have mostly increased.
A 25-year policy on the above basis would be worth Pounds 59,678, up 0.1 per
cent, while a 10-year policy would pay Pounds 6,244, up 1.1 per cent.
