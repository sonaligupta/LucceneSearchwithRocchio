FT  01 JUL 92 / Letter: All fired up, but not sure where to go


   From Mr BERNARD EVERITT


Sir, The conferences and exhibitions advertisements in the FT (June 29)
announce under the International section a conference on 'The future of the
Yorkshire Coal Field', to be held in the well-known continental resort of
'Rotherdam'. This could either be the famous international trading port, or
the Yorkshire town well to the south of Neuchateau, to where coals have been
taken before now. Take your pick]
