FT  22 JUL 94 / International Company News: Bank of East Asia posts
disappointing results

Bank of East Asia, Hong Kong's third largest listed bank, has reported
disappointing growth in first-half earnings, with profits for the six months
to June only 12 per cent ahead of the interim stage last year, at HKDollars
222.2m (USDollars 28.76m).
The result, struck after a secret transfer to inner reserves, were lower
than analysts had expected. The market was looking for growth in the region
of 18 per cent to 20 per cent. The directors declared an interim dividend of
27.5 cents, up 25 per cent on the interim payout last year.
The results were seen as the harbinger of a lacklustre reporting season for
the rest of Hong Kong's banks.
In keeping with Bank of East Asia's past practice, it provided no details of
its operations. A review by Mr David Li, chief executive, did say, however,
that a residential and commercial property development the bank is
undertaking had got off to a good start.
A report which has interested banking analysts was the one produced by
Merrill Lynch, the US securities house, for Bank of East Asia's recent
HKDollars 1bn bond offering. This gives the first breakdown for analysts of
the bank's financial position.
It shows that residential mortgages accounted for 44 per cent of the the
bank's total loans in 1993. This is above the level recommended by the Hong
Kong Monetary Authority, the colony's central bank.
