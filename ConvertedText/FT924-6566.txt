FT  20 NOV 92 / International Company News: Downturn at Morgan Stanley


   By PATRICK HARVERSON


MORGAN Stanley, the Wall Street securities house, yesterday reported a
slight fall in third-quarter net income to Dollars 110.6m from Dollars
121.8m.
The company blamed the drop in earnings on a contraction in new equity
offerings, and lower revenues from its principal trading business.
The figures would have been more disappointing but for the Dollars 42.6m
gain Morgan Stanley earned from the sale of its stake in MS/Essex Holdings,
and an increase in the carrying value of its investment in Kohl's
Corporation.
Although the company enjoyed strong results from foreign exchange, swaps and
government bond trading (some of the gains were undoubtedly linked to the
turmoil in European bond and currency markets during September), they were
more than offset by poor results in equity and commodities trading.
Overall, Morgan Stanley's earnings from trading for its own account dropped
15.6 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 300.8m.
Investment banking revenues fell 6 per cent to Dollars 182.3m, a reflection
of the fall-off in equity securities offerings and merger activity. The
volume of debt issuance rose during the period, thanks to continued healthy
demand from US and foreign corporations for bond underwriting services.
