FT  27 SEP 94 / International Company News: Cockerill seeks Eko Stahl stake

Cockerill Sambre, Belgium's biggest steel producer, wants to buy a 60 per
cent stake in Eko Stahl, eastern Germany's loss-making steel mill, with a
further option on buying the remaining 40 per cent, Cockerill said
yesterday.
At the same time, Cockerill confirmed it wanted to build an integrated steel
mill, incorporating a hot-rolling mill with the aim of gaining a bigger
foothold in the German market as well as expanding in eastern Europe.
Eko Stahl, located in Eisenhuttenstadt in the eastern state of Brandenburg,
is close to the Polish border. 'We think Eko Stahl would be a very
interesting investment given the fact that we want a greater presence in
Germany,' Cockerill said.
Cockerill, which last week submitted a formal bid to the Treuhand
privatisation agency, said it would be investing between DM800m and DM1bn
(Dollars 519.4m-Dollars 600m) if the deal was accepted. The agency is due to
respond to Cockerill's bid by October 10.
The purchase of Eko Stahl would lift Cockerill's annual capacity. Last year,
the east German mill produced 900,000 tonnes of steel, a fall of nearly 1.2m
since it was placed under the Treuhand in 1990. Cockerill's annual steel
capacity is 4.5m tonnes.
