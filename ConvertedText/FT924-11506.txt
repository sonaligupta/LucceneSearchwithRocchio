FT  26 OCT 92 / Daewoo chief may enter poll

MR KIM WOO-CHOONG, founder and chairman of Daewoo, South Korea's fourth
largest business group, has emerged as a possible candidate in December's
presidential election.
The New Korea Party (NKP), formed only last Friday by politicians aligned
with President Roh Tae-woo's majority faction in the ruling Democratic
Liberal Party (DLP), is considering offering him its nomination.
Mr Kim has not ruled himself out but has expressed doubts about entering
politics.
The NKP recently staged a party revolt in opposition to the DLP presidential
nominee, Mr Kim Young-sam, who heads another faction.
The conservative group has also contacted other prominent figures, including
Mr Park Tae-joon, former chairman of Pohang Iron and Steel.
Mr Kim Woo-choong and Daewoo have close political ties with the
administration of President Roh, who is constitutionally barred from running
again.
Mr Chung Ju-yung, founder and former chairman of Hyundai, the nation's
biggest conglomerate, is also a candidate after forming the United People's
Party earlier this year.
Mr Chung and Mr Kim are bitter business rivals. The former alleges Daewoo
has largely prospered due to government support provided under Mr Roh and
his predecessor.
