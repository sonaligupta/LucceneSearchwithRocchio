FT  23 APR 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance - Survey of
Investment Trusts (28): Disappointment for Pep-pickers - And with so many UK
income trusts close to asset value, investors should be cautious / UK Income
Trusts


   By PHILIP COGGAN


FALLING INTEREST rates have given an enormous boost to the popularity of the
UK income growth sector.
British investors, traditionally suspicious of equities, have started to
desert the building society in search of alternative sources of income. The
result is that many UK income trusts stand either at a premium, or at a very
small discount to net assets.
A trust which can yield 5 per cent gross can appear highly attractive when
held in a personal equity plan, where income is tax-free. Furthermore, the
stock market rally of late 1992 and early 1993 brought investors substantial
capital gains.
Over the year to February 26, the average trust in the sector returned a
whopping 34.1 per cent (mid-market to mid-market, with net income
reinvested). Falling discounts have obviously given a boost to long-term
share price performance figures.
But the chancellor's change to the tax treatment of dividends gives
investment trusts offering a Pep a particular problem.
Investment trusts tend to make additional charges on their Peps, because
plans do cost money to administer, and normal trust fees are quite low.
For basic-rate taxpayers, this extra charge may make some Peps unattractive,
compared with holding the trusts directly. Guinness Flight acted promptly to
cut the annual management charge on its Temple Bar Pep from 1 per cent to
0.75 per cent.
Jack Springman, a director of Temple Bar, commented: 'Peps remain highly
attractive for higher-rate taxpayers, but to ensure that the Temple Bar
Investment Trust Pep remains attractive to basic-rate taxpayers, Guinness
Flight has cut the Pep's annual management charge.'
TR City of London makes an additional annual charge of 1 per cent plus VAT
(1.175 per cent in total) on Peps. It is planning to reduce this charge to
0.5 per cent on Peps worth more than Pounds 6,000. The reduced charge will
only apply to that element of a Pep which is above Pounds 6,000 - so it will
only start to benefit investors when their Peps grow.
But what about investments that are below Pounds 6,000? At the end of March,
TR City was yielding 4.8 per cent. The advance corporation tax (ACT) change
in the Budget might well reduce this gross yield to 4.5 per cent. So take an
investor with Pounds 3,000 in the plan: his tax saving would be Pounds 27.
But the annual charge would be Pounds 35.25; so he would be Pounds 8.25
worse off inside the Pep than outside.
Of course, the investor would still have the capital gains tax shelter, and
the prospect of a lower annual charge should his Pounds 3,000 grow to more
than Pounds 6,000. He might also narrow the gap if the income of the trust
grew faster than its assets. However, the CGT shelter may be of limited use,
because few basic-rate taxpayers make enough capital gains.
While TR City of London is a trust with an excellent long-term record (it
has delivered 25 consecutive annual increases in dividend), the basic-rate
taxpayer who cannot afford a full Pounds 6,000 investment should consider
whether or not he is better off buying it via the conventional savings
scheme than via the Pep.
For higher-rate taxpayers, the benefits of Peps should still be very clear.
On a Pounds 6,000 investment in TR City, the tax savings is Pounds 108 per
annum, well above the Pounds 35.25 charge.
Leaving aside the income argument, the UK trusts have produced some very
impressive net asset value performances. In the 10 years to March 1, for
example, figures from the Association of Investment Trust Companies show
that NAV total return from the UK income sector was 459.6 per cent, compared
with 419.6 per cent from the international general trusts and 453.6 per cent
from Japan.
Lowland, a small trust run by Henderson, has the best NAV return, with 652.6
per cent, followed by TR City (535.1 per cent) and Murray Income (520.1 per
cent). In share price total-return terms, the same three are top, except
with even better figures: Lowland's growth, for example, is 819.6 per cent.
Such growth figures are unlikely to be repeated. Most commentators would
agree that dividend growth in the 1990s will be a lot lower than in the
1980s; some trusts may even need to dip into reserves to maintain their
pay-outs.
In short, investors should examine their trust selection carefully. With so
many UK income trusts close to asset value, it may be worth looking round at
trusts in less fashionable sectors which are standing at wider discounts.
Income trusts may well issue new shares, via rights issues and placings, to
take advantage of times when they stand at a premium. This is a sensible
move, because it is so difficult to launch a new trust, but it can backfire:
if the manager overestimates demand, then a discount could quickly appear.
The sector faces plenty of opportunities in the new low-interest arena, but
plenty of challenges too.
