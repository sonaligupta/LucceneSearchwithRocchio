FT  12 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: F & C share price and net assets
boosted last year - At a glance


Foreign & Colonial Investment Trust's share price rose by 40 per cent during
1993, while net assets grew 31 per cent, the company announced this week.
The trust had net assets of Pounds 1.56bn at the end of 1993, after a good
year on world stock markets. The total dividend for the year increased 5 per
cent to 3.52p.
The trust's share price discount to net asset value has lately been at its
narrowest since 1972, partly as a result of the popularity of the savings
scheme F & C introduced 10 years ago, which has provided a steady source of
demand for shares in the trust, and has widened its shareholder base. F & C
now has almost 75,000 shareholders - an increase of 32 per cent during 1993
 -and individual shareholders own 46 per cent of the trust.
