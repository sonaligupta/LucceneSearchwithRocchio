FT  06 AUG 93 / US mission to study trade prospects


   By REUTER


   HANOI


In another sign of a thaw between the US and Vietnam, Hanoi announced
yesterday that a US congressional delegation would study investment and
trade prospects in Vietnam next week, Reuter reports from Hanoi.
The 12-member team from the House of Representatives' ways and means
committee will be one of the first congressional economic missions to
Vietnam, with which the US has no diplomatic relations. The visit from
August 12 to 15 comes a month before US President Bill Clinton must decide
whether to lift the US economic embargo against Hanoi dating from 1964.
The aim of the mission is 'to study Vietnam's renovation policy and economic
development and business and investment opportunities in Vietnam,' Ms Ho The
Lan, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, said.
Mr Clinton is under pressure from conflicting pressure groups as the
September 14 deadline approaches for him to renew or scrap the embargo.
War veteran groups want him to maintain the sanctions, but US companies want
them ended so that they can compete for contracts to be awarded as a result
of his move a month ago to lift a US ban on new multilateral lending to
Vietnam.
Ms Lan also announced that Vietnam had accepted a US proposal to station
three diplomats in Hanoi - the first to be posted to Vietnam since 1955,
when the US mission closed following Vietnam's 1954 defeat of French forces
at Dien Bien Phu.
Their official job will be consular, but western diplomats say they will
amount to a US liaison office with Vietnam.
