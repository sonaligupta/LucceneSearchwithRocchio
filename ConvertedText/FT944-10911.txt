FT  08 NOV 94 / International Company News: CRH expands into Argentina with
Dollars 33m stake in tile maker

CRH, the Irish building materials group, has expanded into South America
with a Dollars 33m (Pounds 20m) investment in Canteras Cerro Negro, an
Argentinian tile maker.
The move is the first investment by CRH outside North America and Europe and
is part of its strategy of expanding in emerging markets.
CCN is privately owned and the principal shareholders are an Argentinian
family of Irish extraction, the Diaz O'Kellys. It makes clay roof, wall and
floor tiles and has 30 per cent of the Argentinian market.
CRH is paying Dollars 5.7m for a 20 per cent stake in CCN and has invested
another Dollars 27.3m in the form of a Dollars 9.3m convertible loan and
Dollars 18m in loan capital.
CRH can increase its stake to 51 per cent through conversion of the
convertible loan.
It also has an option to increase its shareholding to 95 per cent, based on
a multiple of CCN's pre tax profits over the next three years. The
Argentinian company last year made an operating profit of Dollars 8.8m on
sales of Dollars 66m.
The loans carry an interest rate of 16 per cent and the investment would be
earnings enhancing for CRH in the first year, said Mr Jack Hayes, managing
director for finance and development at CRH. 'It should be worth Dollars 3m
a year after tax,' he said.
