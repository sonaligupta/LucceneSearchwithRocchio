FT  16 MAR 94 / Observer: Removal time


Sounds of merchant banks on the move in the City of London. No sooner has
BZW, Barclays' international investment bank, been given the green light to
move in to its parent's soon-to-be-vacated Royal Mint Court headquarters,
than word reaches Observer that Barings, the City's oldest merchant bank, is
also flitting.
Barings, which has been at 8 Bishopsgate since 1807, is coy about its future
movements. However, it is clear that, if it goes through with its plan to
combine its merchant bank and fast-growing securities business under one
roof, there is not going to be enough room for everybody at 8 Bishopsgate.
The obvious choice is for Barings to regroup at Baring Securities' vulgar
America Square headquarters near the Tower of London.
But that would mean Barings giving up its precious EC2 postcode, which it
shares with the Bank of England and other pukka members of the British
banking community. No doubt the young turks now running Barings couldn't
care less about their postcode.
But there are still some customers who worry about such things.
