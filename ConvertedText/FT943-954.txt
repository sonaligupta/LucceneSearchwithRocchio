FT  27 SEP 94 / Andersen confirms merger


   By JIM KELLY


Arthur Andersen, the UK's third largest accountancy firm by fee income,
yesterday formally announced its long-awaited merger with parts of Binder
Hamlyn.
Arthur Andersen said seven of Binder Hamlyn's offices would join Arthur
Andersen Worldwide Organisation in a merger which would 'break new ground in
the accounting profession' but would continue to practice under the Binder
Hamlyn name.
The 17 other offices of Binder Hamlyn, which was the eighth largest
accountancy firm, have declined to join the merger.
The new grouping will have a fee income, based on the last published
figures, of almost Pounds 500m a year. This could bring Arthur Andersen
close to KPMG Peat Marwick, the second largest firm by income.
Mr Jim Wadia, UK managing partner for Arthur Andersen, said: 'It is no
secret that we wanted to grow our audit base in the UK market, and organic
growth takes time.'
Mr Adrian Burn, managing partner of Binder Hamlyn, said the polarisation of
the profession made operating outside the big six accountancy firms an
'inhibition' when trying to provide for quoted clients who required access
to an international network of services.
Half the total fee income for Binder Hamlyn came from the Leeds and London
regional offices, which are joining Andersen, with offices in Manchester and
Newcastle.
Of offices outside the new grouping Belfast and Enniskillen have joined
Grant Thornton, Birmingham and Bristol have joined Touche Ross, and Ayr,
Bacup, Bury St Edmunds, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Newmarket, Norwich, Nottingham,
Poole, Rochdale, Saltcoats, Stranraer, and Wolverhampton have joined Stoy
Hayward.
