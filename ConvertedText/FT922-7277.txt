FT  19 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Gas market


As Sir James McKinnon of Ofgas was quick to point out, yesterday's launch of
Alliance Gas marked a welcome development in the UK gas market. The joint
venture between BP, Statoil and Norsk Hydro has its own gas field from the
start. Most previous entrants have set up as intermediaries, aiming to
profit from the enforced reduction to 40 per cent in the industrial market
share of British Gas. Although they may make fast inroads initially, their
profit represents an additional cost for users which they may ultimately be
unwilling to bear.
In the short term, Alliance is well placed to buy supplies from British Gas.
After 1996, the Norwegians will bring significant long-term supplies of
their own to the table. Add in BP's marketing skills and the agreed venture
with East Midlands Electricity, and Alliance should offer steady competition
to the monopolist: hence the regulator's pleasure.
