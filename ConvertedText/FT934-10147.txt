FT  06 NOV 93 / How to Spend It: David Gill's gallery


David Gill's gallery at 60 Fulham Road, London SW3 is well worth visiting at
almost any time for he has always been adept at identifying new talent,
giving it a platform - and a market. He (as well as many collectors and
museums world-wide) is a great admirer of the work of Peter Chang, a
one-time furniture designer turned sculptor who applies his sculptural
techniques to functional objects, like the fantastical salt and pepper pots
above (Pounds 2,850 each). Do not be put off by the price for there is a
great deal of truly interesting work available at much lower cost -
jewellery from Pounds 100, paperweights by Galouste & Bonetti at Pounds 57,
candelabra for Pounds 200.
