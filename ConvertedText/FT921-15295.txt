FT  10 JAN 92 / Money Markets: UK rates softer


THE BANK of England moved early to relieve pressure in the UK money market
yesterday, resulting in sharply lower rates in spite of continued pressure
on sterling on the foreign exchange markets.
The bank forecast a liquidity shortage of Pounds 1.45bn early in the day,
later revised to Pounds 1.5bn, larger than recent shortages due to an
expiring repurchase agreement.
However, the Bank of England quickly moved to relieve the squeeze with an
early round of assistance totalling Pounds 1.359bn.
In a new repurchase agreement, Pounds 830m band 4 bills were purchased for
resale to the market on January 20 at 10 7/16 per cent.
In addition, it purchased outright band 1 bank and treasury bills at 10 3/8
per cent, band 3 LA and bank bills at 10 7/32 per cent and band 4 bank bills
at 10 1/8 per cent. Later in the morning session, the remaining shortage was
taken care of with further purchases of band 1 bank and treasury bills at 10
3/8 per cent, totalling Pounds 150m.
As conditions eased, overnight unsecured money rates came down, trading at 9
3/4 - 1/2 per cent during the morning session and as low as 6 per cent in
the afternoon.
By the close, overnight rates were around 10-9 3/4 per cent, against 10 3/4
 -5/8 per cent on Wednesday.
The key three months inter-bank money rate closed at 10 5/8 - 1/2 per cent
from 10 3/4 - 9/16 per cent on Wednesday.
The March short sterling futures contract on the London International
Financial Futures Exchange traded up to close at 89.53, the day's high,
against 89.38 on Wednesday. This level implies base rates of 10.47 per cent
by the spring, from a current level of 10.5 per cent.
Money market conditions in Tokyo remained very tight in the face of a Y740bn
liquidity shortage and banking reserves well below target. Rates traded up
to 6 1/2 per cent during the day before settling back to 5 1/2 per cent by
the close, up  3/32 per cent from Wednesday's levels.
Having squeezed rates higher for most of this week, the Bank of Japan had to
relieve the liquidity shortage, lending Y400bn to City banks during the day
to reduce their demand for inter-bank funding. In addition, the Bank of
Japan set a Y600bn repurchase agreement which expires on February 4 and a
Y300bn pact which ends on February 12.
