FT  16 NOV 93 / Spanish inflation increases to 4.6%

OCTOBER price rises pushed Spain's year-on-year 'headline' inflation up by
0.1 per cent to 4.6 per cent, reversing the downward trend of recent months,
despite the country's continuing recession and high unemployment.
However, the economy ministry said October's rise was 'transitory' and
stressed the fall in the year-on-year underlying inflation index, which
excludes volatile energy and non-processed food prices, from 5.4 per cent to
5.3 per cent, the lowest underlying level since May 1988.
Food prices in October last year were unusually low, and kept the October
1992 rise down to 0.1 per cent.
The ministry said October figures nevertheless stressed that Spain's
inflation-prone economy required structural reforms to deregulate the labour
market and the services sector as well as an agreement on wage restraint.
The worst figures facing the government concern unemployment. Registered
jobless rose by 95,969 in October, the highest monthly rise since 1982, said
the National Employment Institute, to total 2.6m or 17.2 per cent of the
working population.
