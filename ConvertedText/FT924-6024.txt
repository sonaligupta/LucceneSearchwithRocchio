FT  24 NOV 92 / Insider dealers face fines or jail


   By R. C. MURTHY

THE INDIAN government has banned insider trading in stocks and shares, as
part of capital market reforms, R. C. Murthy reports from Bombay.
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), the market watchdog,
which will administer the insider trading laws, can impose a penalty of
Rs500,000 (Pounds 11,500) or two years' imprisonment or both for violations.
The administration of Mr P. V. Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, is rushing
through the reforms as foreign investors, who from earlier this year have
been able to make direct purchases on India's stock exchanges, are holding
back in the absence of a proper regulatory mechanism.
The laws have been made effective from last Thursday when allegations were
made of insider trading in the shares of Tata Engineering and Locomotive, a
market leader, which last week announced that net profits plunged by three
quarters in the first half to September. Its share price had fallen from
Rs301 in early November to Rs222.50 last week.
Sebi relented yesterday on registration fees for brokers. Mr G. V.
Ramakrishna, Sebi chairman, has agreed to make appropriate changes in the
definition of 'annual turnover' to bring down the fee.
