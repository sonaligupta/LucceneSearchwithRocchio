FT  23 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Strong growth in Pru's single premium sales


   By RICHARD LAPPER


PRUDENTIAL, the UK's largest life insurance company, reported strong growth
in single premium sales in the first six months of 1993 and a 5 per cent
reduction in income from annual premiums.
The figures provide further evidence of growing interest among savers in
life insurance products as interest rates fall, but consumers are still
reluctant to enter long-term regular financial commitments because of
concerns about job security.
Worldwide single premiums increased by 40 per cent to Pounds 2.89m, with
annual premium income down to Pounds 266m. Overall new business grew by 14
per cent (based on annual premiums plus 10 per cent of single premiums).
In the UK single premiums rose by more than a third to Pounds 1.42bn, mainly
as a result of the continued popularity of the with profits Prudence Bond
and strong sales of corporate pensions. Annual premiums fell by 11 per cent
to Pounds 153m following an expected decline in the sale of industrial
branch (or cash collection) policies. Ordinary branch business remained
unchanged at Pounds 143m.
Single premium for corporate pensions increased by 28 per cent to Pounds
309m while annual premiums rose by 24 per cent to Pounds 31m. Single premium
growth reflected strong sales of immediate annuities and transfers from
other group schemes.
Prudential's international operations produced strong results, with sales of
single premiums by Jackson National Life rising by 11 per cent to Dollars
1.1bn (Pounds 730m).
