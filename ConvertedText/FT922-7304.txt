FT  19 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: MPs press Bank over Maxwell


   By ALISON SMITH


THE Bank of England is coming under further pressure from MPs over its role
in the Maxwell pensions affair.
Mr David Shaw, Tory MP for Dover, has tabled a Commons motion calling on the
Bank to carry out and publish an inquiry into the commercial banks' lending,
currency and share-dealing transactions with Mr Robert Maxwell.
The Bank's attitude will also be raised with Mr Peter Lilley, social
security secretary, by Mr Richard Page and Mr Frank Field, who are meeting
him this morning on behalf of a cross-party group of MPs concerned about the
plight of the Maxwell pensioners.
Mr Shaw said that unless the Bank carried out an investigation and published
its results, the public - as well as the Maxwell pensioners - would feel the
whole issue had not been properly scrutinised.
'The public will be left with a nasty taste in the mouth if we don't get to
the bottom of it,' he said yesterday.
He also called for government action against the government and financial
institutions of Liechtenstein - where Mr Maxwell held a number of trusts -
through some form of economic sanctions, perhaps by refusing to allow
transactions to take place with them.
MPs campaigning for the Maxwell pensioners have become increasingly
frustrated that in the six months after the state of the pension funds
emerged there has been little progress in finding solutions to the
pensioners' difficulties.
