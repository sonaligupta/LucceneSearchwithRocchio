FT  24 AUG 92 / Iran 'bans free speech'


   By EDWARD MORTIMER


Freedom of expression in Iran is still 'brutally suppressed', despite the
victory of 'moderates' backed by President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani in
elections, Article 19, the international anti-censorship pressure group,
says, Edward Mortimer writes.
Under Mr Rafsanjani, the group says in a report published today, journalists
have been arrested, newspapers banned and newspaper offices ransacked by
government officials or hardline opposition groups, whose activities go
unpunished. The clampdown on journalists and artists 'continued with renewed
vigour' after widespread anti-government riots in April and May, and in June
the new parliament reaffirmed the late Ayatollah Khomeini's death sentence
against Mr Salman Rushdie.
