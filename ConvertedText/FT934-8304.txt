FT  16 NOV 93 / International Company News: Saab Auto recovery quickens


   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES


   STOCKHOLM


SAAB Automobile stepped up the recovery pace in the third quarter of 1993
with a 47 per cent reduction in losses after financial items, to SKr285m
(Dollars 34.8m).
The result, which compares with a SKr541m deficit in the same 1992 period,
reflects the benefits of a cost-cutting programme.
It means that losses at the company, jointly-owned by General Motors of the
US and Saab-Scania, amounted to SKr844m over the first nine months, down 37
per cent from SKr1.34bn last time.
A 20 per cent rise in sales, to SKr3.72bn, during the latest quarter helped
lift sales for the first nine months by 3 per cent to SKr11.5bn.
The improvement reflects the company's invoicing to dealers and importers,
rather than improved market conditions or any significant benefit from the
depreciation of the krona.
Retail sales were substantially lower at 53,000 cars, compared with 66,000
last year, largely because the group stopped making its old 900 series in
March.
The latest figures include some sales of the new 900 model which was
launched on the European market in September. The launch has led to an
upturn in group sales in Sweden. A positive response in other key markets,
including the UK and US, is expected in the final few months.
Car sales of between 73,000 and 75,000 are expected in the full year. This
is less than the 80,000 units originally forecast.
Although Saab expects to remain in the red for the full year, it says its
deficit will be 'substantially lower' than last year's SKr2.69bn loss.
It is looking to end a run of five consecutive years of losses next year
with at least a break-even result.
