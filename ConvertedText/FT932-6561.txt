FT  27 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading


   By JOEL KIBAZO


THE derivatives sector traded firmly in response to the successful UK gilts
auction and suggestions of a reduction in UK base rates, although volume
remained thin, writes Joel Kibazo.
In futures, trading in the June contract on the FT-SE 100 Index opened at
2,844, just below its previous finish, and initially fell back to 2,836 on a
sizeable selling order.
That done, the contract regained strength and moved ahead, boosted by the
outcome of the gilts auction and the speculation on interest rate cuts.
A firm Wall Street ensured that June continued to move forward, although the
absence of leading institutions from the day's main action meant that volume
remained low.
Having reached the day's high of 2,857 just ahead of the official close,
June finished at 2,854, up 10 from its previous close and 2 points above its
fair value premium to cash of 5. Volume was 6,843 lots.
In traded options, turnover was also poor, reaching 25,795 contracts. Just
over a third of the total was dealt in the index options, the FT-SE 100
option trading 6,644 and the Euro FT-SE option 3,275 lots.
Hanson was the busiest stock option on 2,023 lots transacted, with the
August 260 calls the most active series. It was followed by Argyll at 1,204,
with the majority of the trading done in the July 330 puts. ICI, Guinness
and RTZ were also active.
