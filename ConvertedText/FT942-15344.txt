FT  15 APR 94 / UK Company News: Brooks Service back in the black


In spite of fierce competition that led to price reductions in many areas,
Brooks Service Group, the textile rental and retail services company, swung
from losses of Pounds 392,000 to profits of Pounds 323,000 pre-tax for the
year to December 25.
Turnover was marginally lower at Pounds 23.9m (Pounds 24.2m) but interest
charges were cut to Pounds 348,000 (Pounds 532,000).
Earnings per share emerged at 3.13p (losses 1.76p) and a proposed final
dividend of 1p makes a total of 1.5p (nil).
Although trading conditions continued to be difficult the directors said
there were 'encouraging' signs in some areas. Actions taken had 'laid a good
foundation' for improved profitability.
Year-end gearing was reduced to 46 per cent (58 per cent).
The shares closed 1p higher at 70p, after 74p.
