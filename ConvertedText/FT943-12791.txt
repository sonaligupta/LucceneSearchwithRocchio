FT  22 JUL 94 / International Company News: Trizec's debt restructuring plan
approved


   By BERNARD SIMON


   TORONTO


An Alberta court has approved Trizec's debt-restructuring plan despite
objections from the property developer's junior debenture holders.
The plan, which has been under negotiation for almost a year, is scheduled
for implementation from July 25. However, the dissenting creditors,
consisting mainly of US 'vulture funds' have indicated that they plan to
appeal the court ruling.
Under the plan, control of Trizec will pass from Toronto's Bronfman family
to Horsham, the investment company controlled by entrepreneur Mr Peter Munk,
and Argo Partnership, a fund managed by New York's O'Connor Group.
