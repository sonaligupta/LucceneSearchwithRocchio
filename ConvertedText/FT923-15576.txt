FT  01 JUL 92 / Business links with charities backed


   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent


SHAREHOLDERS strongly support the idea of companies working with charities
but most managers fail to realise the fact, according to research published
today.
A survey by the charity National Children's Home shows that 78 per cent of
shareholders would prefer to invest in a company that took part in
charitable activity.
Only 7 per cent of businesses involved in the study, however, believed that
potential shareholders were more likely to invest if they worked with the
voluntary sector.
'Clearly companies are underestimating their shareholders' support for
charity links,' the report says.
Only 28 per cent of companies, according to the study, sought to work with
charities that had links with their type of products.
The research confirms the development of a more structured approach to the
commercial sector's relationship with charities. Companies are moving away
from making large cash donations to organised sponsorship and promotional
activity.
The report says that while the business sector's demand for professionalism
from charities was largely being met, there were still 'horror stories' of
charity representatives attending City meetings in jeans and T-shirts. 'Some
charities still do not share an understanding of the marketing benefits a
company looks for,' the report concludes.
