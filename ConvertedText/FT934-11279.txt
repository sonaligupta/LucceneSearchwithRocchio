A GERMAN consortium headed by the big plant contractor SMS Schloemann-Siemag
has won the contract for a DM1bn (Pounds 406.5m) steel plant at
Magnitogorsk, in the heart of Russia's Urals steel industry.
The cold reduction mill will have a capacity of about 2m tonnes of sheet
metal a year, and will come into production at the beginning of 1997,
according to an announcement from SMS company head-quarters in Dusseldorf
yesterday.
The 10-member consortium includes Siemens, the engineering conglomerate,
Hochtief, the Essen construction company, and MAN Gutehoffnungshutte, as
well as Magnitostroy, the construction company in Magnitogorsk.
The contract is worth DM300m to SMS, which has just announced a 54 per cent
drop in profits for 1992/93, to DM39m on a turnover of DM1.968bn, because of
the worldwide slowdown in investment plans, especially in the steel
industry.
The company is involved in three other big projects in Russia, including
another cold reduction mill (with Siemens) at Novo-Lipetsk, the
modernisation of a hot rolling mill at Novo-Lipetsk, and the modernisation
of an aluminium plant at Samara.
A spokesman said yesterday that the contract was on a cash basis, and would
be financed by revenues from steel exports of the Magnitogorsk Metallurgical
Kombinat (MMK).
It does not have any export credit guarantees from Hermes, the German export
credit agency.
With production capacity of 16m tonnes and a workforce of 65,000 people, MMK
is one of Russia's biggest steel makers.
