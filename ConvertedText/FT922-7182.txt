FT  20 MAY 92 / People: New directors for Southern Water


William Courtney, who has combined the roles of chairman and managing
director of Southern Water since the company was privatised over two years
ago, has announced the appointment of a new group managing director.
Martyn Webster, 45, the present group finance director, will take over his
new duties on January 1 next year.
The move acknowledges the wider role that Webster has progressively played
in the development of Southern Water since flotation, and ends an
embarrassing episode for the company.
The managing director originally appointed to lead the former water
authority into the private sector was found to be unsuitable shortly after
and left almost immediately, leaving Courtney to do both jobs.
Webster's role of group finance director will be taken by Raymond King, who
will join the main board on January 1, after joining the company as group
finance director designate on June 1. King, 39, has spent the past 14 years
at ICI in a number of senior finance posts both in the UK and overseas, most
recently as controller, corporate operations.
Another new board member from January will be Keith Tozzi, 43, the deputy
group technical director, who has been in the water industry since 1966 and
has played an important role in the development of Southern's water and
wastewater operations.
