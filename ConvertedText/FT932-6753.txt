FT  27 MAY 93 / Investment managers angry over SIB training proposals


   By BARRY RILEY


AN ANGRY response by many members of Imro, the investment managers'
regulatory body, to 'unworkable' proposals for training and competence has
surfaced in a special circular from the Institutional Fund Managers'
Association (Ifma), which represents almost all the top City investment
houses.
It amounts to the first challenge from the investment industry to the plans
announced this week by the Securities and Investments Board, the top
investor protection agency, to crack down on allegedly slack regulation by
junior bodies such as Imro.
'Considerable concern has been expressed to us by our members about the new
proposals,' says Ifma. 'Some members doubt that the proposals are even
workable.'
Ifma has requested a joint meeting with Imro and SIB to press for changes.
The uproar relates to the consultation document on training and competence
arrangements for Imro members issued last month. Ifma members have been
especially concerned about measures added since an Imro working party in
April 1992 recommended a flexible training and competence code.
In his report to the Treasury this week, Mr Andrew Large, SIB chairman, said
one of SIB's most important tasks was the setting of standards for investor
protection, including standards of training and competence.
But Ifma says the new draft requirements go beyond sensible minimum
standards.
