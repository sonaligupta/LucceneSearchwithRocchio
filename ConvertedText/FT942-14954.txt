FT  18 APR 94 / UK Company News: UB paid departing US head Pounds 932,000


   By PETER MONTAGNON


United Biscuits paid a total of Pounds 932,000 to Mr Tom Garvin when he
resigned as head of its US subsidiary Keebler last year, according to its
annual report.
UB also confirmed in the report that it cut its contribution to the
Conservative Party from Pounds 130,000 to Pounds 40,000.
Mr Garvin's departure followed a decision to refocus the US business after a
fall in both margins and market share. UB announced restructuring charges of
Pounds 92.5m for its US operations with its annual results last month. After
reorganisation costs group pre-tax profits fell 28 per cent to Pounds 116.7m
last year.
Mr Garvin's payment includes only Pounds 236,000 in cash, which is less than
one year's salary. The remaining Pounds 696,000 consists of pension
contributions to which he was entitled under the terms of his contract.
The report also showed that Sir Robert Clarke, UB's chairman who is due to
become chairman of Thames Water, received an increase of nearly 30 per cent
in his total remuneration. Though Sir Robert's basic salary remained
unchanged at Pounds 439,000, his pension contributions rose to Pounds
299,000 from Pounds 127,000.
