FT  13 NOV 93 / HK accord sought on less contentious issues


   By SIMON HOLBERTON


   HONG KONG


A SENIOR Chinese official for Hong Kong welcomed a suggestion to solve less
contentious elements first in the Sino-British talks over Hong Kong before
continuing discussion on difficult issues.
Mr Wang Qiren, deputy-director of Beijing's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs
Office, was quoted in the pro-communist Ta Kung Pao as saying that a
settlement of the less difficult issues first was a 'good method' for moving
forward.
However, he referred only to the 1994 local government elections, and not
the 1995 polls for the Legislative Council (LegCo) which makes the law in
Hong Kong.
Earlier this week Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, indicated
that more time for talks might be available if Beijing agreed to a reduction
in the voting age to 18 years; to abolishing appointed seats for local
government polls due next year; and to single member constituencies for 20
of LegCo's 60-seats in elections due in 1995.
This was the substance of an offer put to Britain more than a week ago in
Beijing.
The UK government expects Beijing to table the offer formally next Friday
when the sixteenth round of Anglo-Chinese talks on Hong Kong begins.
Hong Kong government officials said that without agreement on these issues
Mr Patten feels he will have no alternative but to present his entire
package of proposals to LegCo.
Any agreement would allow negotiations about the difficult issues involved
in the 1995 elections to proceed for a few weeks more.
London and Beijing, however, still remain deeply divided over the method of
voting in the so-called 'functional constituencies,' which represent the
business and professional class in Hong Kong, and the principle that members
of an election committee, which will elect 10 members to the 1995 LegCo,
should themselves be elected.
