FT  24 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Bayerische Vereinsbank up 10%
in first two months

BAYERISCHE Vereinsbank, the large Bavarian-based bank, said that partial
operating profits of its parent company rose by 10 per cent in the first two
months of this year.
Mr Albrecht Schmidt, the chief executive, said yesterday there was no
indication yet of a downturn in the lively lending business which led the
group to report a 21 per cent increase to DM1.2bn (Dollars 720m) in partial
operating profits for the whole of last year.
Mr Schmidt defended the bank's decision to hold the dividend for 1991 at
DM13 per share - the same as in the past five years - in spite of the
advance in profits, saying that the uncertain economic outlook for Germany
made it sensible to harbour its resources and maintain its financial
resilience.
Moreover, he said, the two rights issues last year meant that the total
dividend would actually rise by 16 per cent. He noted that shareholders had
also benefited from a 25 per cent increase in the share price in 1991.
Bayerische Vereinsbank last week announced a rights issue totalling DM627m
to strengthen its balance sheet ahead of new minimum reserve requirements
and to help fund new lending business later in the year.
Bayerische Hypotheken-und Wechsel-Bank (Hypo-Bank) said group partial
operating profits rose by 18 per cent last year to DM1.2bn.
Total operating profits, which include trading on the bank's own account,
were 27 per cent higher at nearly DM1.4bn. The bank, which last week
announced a DM910m rights issue, is holding its dividend at DM13 a share.
Hypo-Bank said the lending volume of its parent bank rose by 10 per cent
during the year to DM102bn, with the balance sheet total up by 8 per cent to
DM134bn.
The group balance sheet total was 11 per cent higher at DM193bn.
