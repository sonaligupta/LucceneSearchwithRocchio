FT  06 AUG 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report


   By REUTER


Base metal prices largely finished in the minus column on the London Metal
Exchange as earlier advances and stability proved illusory, dealers said.
The three months COPPER price failed to penetrate resistance above Dollars
1,960 but the subsequent retreat was limited by continuing technical
tightness. The price closed at Dollars 1,952.50 a tonne, up Dollars 3.25.
The LEAD market consolidated below an early 2 1/2 -month high of Dollars 420
a tonne for three months metal, closing at Dollars 416.25 a tonne, up
Dollars 4.50. But traders expected the market to notch up further gains,
saying there was an undercurrent of Far Eastern buying interest. At the
London Commodity Exchange COCOA prices continued to ease back, with
contracts gaining up to Pounds 7 a tonne on total turnover of 5,474 lots.
Traders were waiting for fresh news, particularly from West Africa, and in
the meantime were content to let the market drift. White SUGAR futures had a
slow day as prices generally rose with New York. Near October was Dollars
1.50 up at Dollars 267.50 a tonne, in late trading. Traders were looking to
see if New York near Oct would manage to close above 10 cents a lb.
