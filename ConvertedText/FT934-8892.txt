FT  12 NOV 93 / Bremen steel sale provokes outrage

GERMAN private steelmakers expressed outrage yesterday at the decision by
Klockner-Werke, the diversified steel group, to sell its steel mill to a
consortium led by the city state of Bremen.
Officials at Thyssen, the largest steel group in Germany, said the decision
was purely political and would run against the European Union's efforts to
reduce overcapacity in the European steel industry.
Klockner-Werke decided yesterday to sell 75 per cent of its integrated steel
mill in Bremen for a symbolic DM1 each to four local companies. These
include Hiberg, a state-owned holding company, the Bremer Vulkan shipyards,
Hegemann, a company manufacturing shipping equipment and the city's
electricity utility.
The Bremen government plans to keep the loss-making steel mill open with its
current crude steel capacity of around 3m tonnes. It will privatise part of
the profitable electricity utility to raise funds and inject DM200m in the
steel mill.
The decision eliminates a rival offer made by Thyssen and Krupp-Hoesch,
Germany's two largest steemakers and Usinor-Sacilor, the French steel group.
The consortium wanted to close most of the plant, keeping open only its
modern cold-rolling facilities.
