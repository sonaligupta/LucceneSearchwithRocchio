FT  22 JUL 93 / France starts with the cream: First bites at the
privatisation menu


   By JOHN RIDDING


THE handful of companies chosen yesterday to launch France's ambitious
privatisation campaign this autumn suggests the government is keen to do the
easy bit first.
Its strategy is to achieve a smooth start to the sale of the 21 companies
named in its privatisation programme, while maximising receipts to the
state. The companies selected yesterday - among the most attractive assets
in the state's industrial portfolio and with potential combined receipts of
FFr77.5bn-FFr94bn (Pounds 8.80bn-Pounds 10.7bn) - are likely to represent
the best chance of success.
Elf-Aquitaine, the country's biggest industrial company and one of the
world's largest oil groups, Rhone-Poulenc, one of the largest international
chemicals companies, and BNP, one of the country's biggest banks, are the
principal companies in the first batch for the privatisation block.
Banque Hervet, a relatively small retail bank with an estimated market value
of about FFr1bn was the fourth company on the list. The state insurance
groups, UAP and AGF, which had been tipped to be part of the first group
were omitted, a reflection of the current difficulties of the French
insurance market.
The three principal groups are familiar to domestic and international
investors. They all have quotations on the Paris bourse, following the issue
of shares and 'certificats d'investissment' (non-voting preference shares).
This will facilitate the task of pricing the issues.
With the exception of Elf, they have existing shareholders which could
provide the basis for a 'noyau dur' - a core of stable investors. The
inclusion of BNP may prepare it to be a core shareholder in other privatised
groups.
'This is pretty much the cream of the state sector,' said one merchant
banker in Paris. 'The problems will come further down the list.'
For the moment, however, the effects of recession in France and difficulties
in some of their sectors may have given the cream a slightly sour taste.
Mr Loik Le Floch-Prigent, chairman of Elf, has warned of a 25 per cent fall
in operating profits in the first half of the year - the result of weakness
in the basic chemicals market and of sharp price falls in fertilisers.
'The major difference from the previous period is that these businesses took
a sharp move downwards and we didn't have the opportunity to compensate with
other areas,' Mr Floch-Prigent said yesterday.
Similarly, Mr Michel Pebereau, who took over as chairman of BNP in May,
warned last month of a substantial fall in profits for the first six months
of the year. Faced with a sharp increase in small business failures and the
depressed property market, profits are expected to fall to FFr500m-FFr550m
in the first half, compared with FFr1.33bn.
Rhone-Poulenc is confronted with what Mr Jean-Pierre Tirouflet, its finance
director, describes as 'one of the most serious crises in the chemicals
industry in recent history'.
But the various candidates have been implementing restructuring programmes
which, according to analysts, have strengthened their operations and left
them well placed to benefit when economic conditions improve.
Since Mr Floch-Prigent was appointed chairman in 1989, Elf has expanded its
downstream activities through a series of acquisitions. These include the UK
assets of Amoco and Occidental. Under Mr Jean-Rene Fourtou, Rhone-Poulenc
has reduced its exposure to the troubled fibres sector and base chemicals,
and expanded its presence in higher value products such as pharmaceuticals.
BNP has embarked on a cost-cutting programme and has been quicker than most
of its French counterparts to provide for bad loans.
As a result of their various strategies the groups believe the worst is
over. Analysts expect Rhone-Poulenc's net profits to increase from FFr1.5bn
in 1992 to FFr1.8bn this year. Elf is expected to see some recovery in
healthcare and to have a lower interest bill because of reduced rates.
The various groups have been busily preparing themselves for sale.
Rhone-Poulenc has made a series of disposals to reduce a debt:equity ratio
of 80 per cent at the end of last year. Earlier this month, for example, it
sold its 35 per cent stake in Roussel-Uclaf, the speciality chemicals
business, for about FFr4.5bn.
At BNP, Mr Pebereau has brought his experience of privatisation from Credit
Commercial de France, which was successfully sold under the previous
conservative government in 1987. Yesterday, Elf reduced the minimum number
of shares that investors can buy from 100 to 10. For the French Sid,
therefore, a stake in the oil group would now cost about FFr4,000 compared
with FFr40,000.
The French government is confident of adequate domestic demand. Officials
cite the success of the Balladur bond, issued earlier this month. The bond,
which is convertible into equity in privatisation issues, attracted
FFr110bn, almost three times the target amount.
Ultimately, of course, the appetite for privatisation shares will depend on
the price. But with trickier propositions further down the list - such as
Bull, the indebted computer manufacturer, and Usinor Sacilor, the
loss-making steel producer - the government will be keen to ensure that the
price is right for the first on the block.
