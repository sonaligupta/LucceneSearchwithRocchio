FT  12 MAR 92 / Irish ask EC protocol change over abortion


   By TIM COONE


   DUBLIN


The Irish government is asking its EC partners to approve an amendment to a
protocol to the Maastricht Treaty, which would guarantee the right of
unrestricted travel of Irish women abroad who wish to have an abortion, Tim
Coone reports from Dublin.
Mr David Andrews, the Irish foreign minister, said after talks in Brussels
'there had been 'a positive response to our situation'. The proposal will be
presented to the next EC foreign ministers' meeting on April 6.
The recent Supreme Court ruling on a case involving a 14 year-old rape
victim established the right of a pregnant woman who was threatening suicide
to seek an abortion abroad, but does not confer that right on pregnant women
who do not face an imminent threat to their lives.
