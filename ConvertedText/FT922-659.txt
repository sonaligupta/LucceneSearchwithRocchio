expectations

   NEW YORK


LOTUS Development, the US personal computers software publisher best known
for its spreadsheet programs, yesterday warned that its second-quarter
results would disappoint Wall Street.
Although the company expects earnings per share to rise by at least 40 per
cent to between 30 and 40 cents for the quarter to June 30, the results are
significantly lower than the 45 cents analysts had expected.
The stock market reacted to the news by marking Lotus's shares Dollars 4 3/4
lower to Dollars 19 1/4 in active morning trading.
In 1991, second-quarter net income was Dollars 9.1m or 21 cents a share on
revenues of Dollars 186.4m.
