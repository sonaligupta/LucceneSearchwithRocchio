FT  01 JUL 92 / NUM told to plan for sell-off


   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff


MINERS' leaders were told yesterday by Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's energy
spokesman, to accept that they would probably lose the battle against
privatisation of the mining industry.
Mr Dobson said at the National Union of Mineworkers annual conference in
Scarborough he now believed 'the cards are stacked heavily against keeping
coal in the public sector'.
The NUM should draw up plans to protect the most vulnerable pits and
maintain safety standards, he said.
Mr Arthur Scargill, NUM president, disagreed that privatisation was now
inevitable. If contingency plans were discussed, then 'everyone in Britain
knows we have conceded the argument', he said.
Mr Scargill outlined a campaign of action against sell-offs that would
include legal appeals to the European Court. The NUM is to argue that
British Coal or future mine owners should repay money saved by taking
pension contribution holidays. The union also wants to see the repayment of
some EC grants if privatisation goes ahead.
Mr Scargill added that the conference 'should not rule out any additional
action' if other strategies failed.
