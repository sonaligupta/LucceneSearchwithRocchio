FT  29 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Japanese equities
recover as Pacific Basin divides

   TOKYO


POLITICAL nervousness was assuaged by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's
resilience in Sunday's Tokyo municipal assembly elections, and share prices
rose 1.2 per cent on buying by public funds and dealers, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average closed up 227.19 at 19,886.76 after a low of 19,675.13
and a high of 19,976.61. However, in spite of the market's strength, genuine
investors remained on the sidelines, and volume fell to 240m shares against
261m.
Gainers led losers by 754 to 260 with 149 unchanged. The Topix index of all
first section stocks rose 16.42 to 1,600.47, topping the 1,600 level for the
first time in eight trading days while, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
fell 1.69 to 1,209.91.
The Tokyo metropolitan election has been considered an indicator of voter
sentiment ahead of the July 18 parliamentary elections. In spite of
forecasts that the ruling LDP would be hit by the recent defections due to a
row over political reform, the LDP gained one seat to 44, while the Social
Democratic Party, the largest in opposition, lost over half its seats to 13.
The Japan New Party, a reformist group, increased its seats from 2 to 20.
Mr Alex Kinmont, a strategist at Morgan Stanley, said that share prices
would move sideways with short term traders dabbling in incentive backed
issues. 'The political upheaval is all about finding a new structure, and
poses less risk to investors than change in ruling parties in other western
countries,' he added.
All sectors gained, with airlines rising 4.1 per cent on the higher yen.
Japan Airlines put on Y47 to Y790, with All Nippon Airways up Y30 to Y1,150.
Minebea, the ball bearings company, plunged Y30 to Y574 on reports on its
mounting loan guarantees to its troubled financial subsidiary.
Electricals were mixed on the higher yen. NEC fell Y2 to Y938, but Fujitsu
gained Y10 to Y738. Hopes of a higher gold market prompted buying in mining
stocks, with Sumitomo Metal Mining up Y10 to Y1,010.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 202.00 to 21,965.23 to 17.6m shares. The
index rose on small-lot buying by individuals.
Roundup
THE region, which frequently has a number of fairly static equity markets,
was divided between significant rises and falls although turnover, too, was
a moveable feast.
HONG KONG was boosted by the news of more talks on Hong Kong's controversial
new airport, and the Hang Seng index closed 134.02, or 1.9 per cent higher
at 7,148.10 in turnover up from HKDollars 4.58bn to HKDollars 5.05bn.
China-linked stocks prospered, World Trade topping the active list in
turnover of HKDollars 311.9m as it rose 30 cents to HKDollars 2.325.
Unisouth was up HKDollars 1.90 to HKDollars 15.
AUSTRALIA's gold stocks and key blue chips gained ground. The All Ordinaries
Index closed 14.7 higher at 1,715.1 in turnover of ADollars 255.4m as the
golds index soared 68 points to 1,854.8.
BHP also provided direction, moving up 18 cents to ADollars 14.10 after
announcing more than doubled earnings, and a positive outlook for the
current year last Friday.
NEW ZEALAND crept up to its highest close in almost three years, the NZSE-40
index ending 12.25 higher at 1,667.54 in low turnover of NZDollars 18m.
Telecom rose to a record high of NZDollars 3.15 as the stock realigned
itself to its price in the United States.
SINGAPORE and KUALA LUMPUR closed higher on technical rebounds, the Straits
Times Industrial index rising 11.47 to 1,783.14 and the KLSE composite
finishing 13.27, of 11.9 per cent better at 722.07. MANILA offered much the
same story as the composite index closed 13.00 higher at 1,556.41.
TAIWAN saw a bearish final hour, the weighted index ending 98.83, or 2.4 per
cent lower at 4,044.46 in thin turnover. Trade in SEOUL was light, too, as
the composite stock index shed 15.05 to 734.22. BANGKOK slid in moderate
turnover as investors worried over the US attack on Iraq, the SET index
losing 12.02, or 1.3 per cent to 884.54.
KARACHI was propelled higher by blue chip buying as investors welcomed
Sunday's rapprochement talks between Pakistan's president, Mr Ghulam Ishaq
Khan, and its prime minister, Mr Nawaz Sharif. The KSE index rose 13.45 to
1,264.52.
BOMBAY weakened ahead of a news conference by the stockbroker at the centre
of India's Dollars 1.28bn securities scandal. Mr Harshad Mehta threatened to
make further revelations, and the BSE index closed 42.98 lower at 2,161.07.
