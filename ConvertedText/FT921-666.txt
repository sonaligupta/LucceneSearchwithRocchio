FT  27 MAR 92 / Observer: Flying colours


Readers finding Britain's election campaign humdrum may like to know it has
at least provided one surprise, albeit outside the UK. It happened to a
British ski-ing party returning from Austria.
When they went to board their flight home at Salzburg airport, they were
stunned to find the Stansted-bound aircraft gaily emblazoned with the Labour
party campaign motif, complete with red rose.
One of the skiers, Tina Pulsford, marketing services manager with Hayters of
Bishops Stortford, says the 80 passengers were disgusted. 'We didn't expect
to be flying home in an advertising vehicle. We don't want political
opinions forced on us - especially as we're the sort of people that Labour
intends to clobber.'
Some passengers threatened not to board the plane. But all finally did so,
even though not entirely pacified by British Air Ferries' explanation that
the plane was going on to fulfil a Labour party charter.
'Mind you, we did have the last laugh once we boarded,' says Pulsford. 'The
interior of the Red Rose special is bright blue.'
