FT  12 MAR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Selling spoils dollar party


   By NEIL BUCKLEY


THE DOLLAR saw earlier advances eroded in furious late trading as
speculative selling and central bank intervention dampened the market's
earlier optimism, writes Neil Buckley.
Sterling, meanwhile, had a quiet day after Tuesday's UK Budget, up a touch
against the D-Mark, and strengthening against the US currency at the end of
the day.
The dollar had approached the DM1.68 barrier, and surged against the yen to
a high of Y134.35 as a range of sellers gave the Japanese currency a
battering. In late afternoon, however, action by both Swiss National Bank,
which intervened to sell dollars and D-Marks, and a major south-east Asian
player, sparked off dollar profit-taking.
It closed at around DM1.6640, down from a DM1.6755/65 start, and at Y133.55
from Y133.87/97.
In Tokyo, intervention by the Bank of Japan had not been able to halt the
dollar's steady climb to Y133.69/74. The BoJ was reported to have sold a
total of Dollars 500m in five bouts of intervention between Y133 and
Y133.50, but without success.
'The Bank of Japan seems to have been whistling in the wind,' said Mr Peter
Luxton, senior economist at Barclays. 'I do not think other central banks
are interested in intervening and all the indicators point to a bearish
yen.'
Mr Luxton said good February US retail sales figures today - with estimates
varying from a 0.4 to 0.7 per cent increase - would reinforce dollar
optimism, and see it challenging the top of its range. Its next target could
be Y135.
The D-Mark was also stronger against the yen, reaching Y80.13/24 compared
with Y79.47/58 on Tuesday, although the Swiss National Bank intervention
achieved its aim by keeping it below SFr0.9100, to finish little changed at
SFr0.9070.
The D-Mark also fell against the French franc to its lowest level since last
August, but was little changed against most EMS currencies.
The pound was unruffled by a fall in UK equities and gilts, and final
confirmation of the date of the general election as April 9. It remained
close to its floor against the peseta, but firmed slightly against the
D-Mark to DM2.8716, from DM2.8697 at the opening.
Dealers said the strength of the peseta against the D-Mark was putting a
technical floor under the sterling/D-Mark rate which was preventing some
dealers from following their inclination to sell sterling short.
Attention today, however, will be focused on the first telephone opinion
polls since the Budget, although some are worried that it is too early to
assess its real impact.
Mr Luxton added: 'It may take some time for the Budget to feed through into
the opinion polls. It is a slow-fire Budget as opposed to a quick-fire one.'
Sterling firmed against the dollar at the close to Dollars 1.7257, from
Dollars 1.7187 on Tuesday.
