FT  05 AUG 93 / Observer: Handy men


No prizes for guessing which countries earned top marks at the 32nd
International Youth Skill Olympiad just closed in Taiwan. Of course - the
host nation and South Korea, producing 30 medals between them.
Less predictable was the fact that joint fifth, with Austria, and ahead of
the impeccably highly qualified Germans was, yes, Britain. Overcoming a
reputation for a lousy workforce with a paucity of skills, the Brits managed
three silver and six bronze medals, with five diplomas of excellence to
boot.
Round the other side of the world, British yoof shone particularly in
construction skills, with medals in bricklaying, stonemasonry, plastering,
plumbing and joinery. Why on earth can't they do it at home?
