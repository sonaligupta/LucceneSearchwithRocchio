FT  16 DEC 94 / Nescafe price rise ignores the trend


   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES


Nestle, the multinational food company which produces the Nescafe brand of
coffee, said yesterday it will go ahead with a 7 per cent increase in
wholesale prices from December 20 in spite of a sharp drop in world prices
over the past week.
Since the company announced the planned price rise on December 7,
international coffee prices have dropped by 13 per cent. The world market
has fallen by 40 per cent since September as assessments for world supply
have become more optimistic.
Nestle's forthcoming price increase will be the third rise this year in the
wholesale market, and will inevitably push up consumer prices. The company
said yesterday that it does not respond to short-term changes in coffee bean
prices.
Kraft Jacobs Suchard, part of the Philip Morris group and one of Nestle's
competitors, announced yesterday it was cancelling a planned increase in
French retail coffee prices over the next three months. The company said
this was in response to lower world prices.
World prices tripled this year after frosts damaged coffee trees in Brazil
during the main growing season. The market peaked at over Dollars 4,000
(Pounds 2,440) a tonne in September, but by yesterday had slipped to Dollars
2,510 a tonne. Trading at the London Commodity Exchange showed some
consolidation yesterday after a Dollars 200 drop in the market on Wednesday,
but prices remain weak.
