FT  22 DEC 92 / Observer: Energy loss


Reports are filtering through of a small contretemps in the normally
peaceful senior common room of Chatham House, or the Royal Institute of
International Affairs, to give Britain's premier foreign-policy think tank
its proper title. Gerald Pollio, head of the important energy and
environment programme, is on the way out after less than six months on the
job.
While these types of personnel upheaval are not uncommon in big business, or
US banking where Pollio comes from, they are highly unusual in such an
egghead ambience.
Under Pollio's predecessor Jonathan Stern the institute made quite a name
for itself in the energy and environment game. Its programme has twice as
many corporate sponsors as any other. Hence a certain embarrassment at the
programme chief's departure.
Chatham House high command is keeping mum. But one suggestion is that Pollio
had had some difficulty making the transition from commerce to academe. If
so, corporate sponsors might sympathise with him.
