FT  06 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Dowty on target with Pounds 32.7m - Strong
performance in the final quarter expected to continue


   By MAGGIE URRY


DOWTY GROUP, the aerospace company fighting for its independent future
against a Pounds 522.2m bid from TI Group, yesterday published annual
results showing pre-tax profits of Pounds 32.7m in the year to end March.
The figure was in line with the group's earlier forecasts.
Mr Roy Roberts, Dowty chairman, said that there had been a strong
performance in the final quarter of the financial year which he expected to
continue. Following the cuts made to the group's cost base, including 3,000
job losses, he felt Dowty was well placed to benefit from improved trading
conditions.
Late in the day Dowty put out a statement, at the request of the Takeover
Panel, saying it had made no profit forecast for the current year. There had
been talk that Dowty's profits would bounce to between Pounds 50m and Pounds
55m, but Dowty said this speculation had no proper foundation.
Although profits were down from Pounds 60.6m in the previous year, the
figure was well above analysts' estimates of around Pounds 22m prior to
Dowty's forecast in its defence document of Pounds 29m and its prediction of
a Pounds 3m-Pounds 4m payment relating to the cancellation of a contract.
The Pounds 32.7m pre-tax figure included a Pounds 3.7m payment for the
cancellation. Mr Reg Moore, finance director, said that such payments were a
normal part of the business and he did not regard the amount as significant
in group terms.
TI, whose bid closes on June 10 at 1pm, rapidly responded raising questions
which it said the Dowty statement had not answered. Mr Chris Lewinton,
chairman and chief executive, said 'these figures only serve to highlight
the generosity of our offers'.
At last night's closing share price for TI of 361p, down 3p, the
eight-for-15 share offer is worth 192.5p per Dowty ordinary share. Dowty's
shares closed at 180p, down 2p, still above the 174.67p cash alternative.
Dowty's turnover was 9.7 per cent lower at Pounds 694.5m and operating
profits pre-exceptionals were 37.2 per cent down to Pounds 49.5m.
Exceptional items, relating to redundancy and reorganisation costs were
Pounds 1.8m (Pounds 4.8m). The interest charge rose to Pounds 14.9m (Pounds
12.8m) as borrowings were up Pounds 21m to Pounds 134m.
Earnings per share were 8.2p (15p) failing to cover a planned unchanged
total dividend of 9.2p, with a proposed 5.6p final. At the 192.5p offer
price, the p/e is 23.5.
The aerospace division saw trading profits drop to Pounds 27.8m (Pounds
41.3m) as the military side reduced and there was destocking of spares for
civil aircraft. Electronic systems contributed profits of Pounds 14.3m
(Pounds 13m) but this included the Pounds 3.7m cancellation payment.
Dowty's information technology division, which has been the target of
criticism by TI, lost Pounds 4.1m (profit Pounds 9.5m). Within that there
was a Pounds 4.4m loss at Cognito, the public data messaging service which
only went into operation last autumn. Polymer engineering made an unchanged
Pounds 9.6m.
TI said that Dowty had reported profits after charging Pounds 25.7m of
reorganisation costs directly to the balance sheet. But Mr Moore said these
costs were set against provisions made through the profit and loss account
in the previous year.
