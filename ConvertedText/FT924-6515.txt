FT  20 NOV 92 / Observer: Out of the frying pan


For all the warmth Norman Lamont's Autumn Statement has won him on the Tory
backbenches, there are murmurs that he may still be on the slide. Indeed,
some say the success itself will make it easier for him to accept a
'dignified' transfer.
True, the chancellor will have none of it, telling friends he has a personal
assurance from John Major that he's safe in the Treasury. But that has not
stopped Westminster's favourite game.
One suggestion is that Lamont could be moved to Defence, still a big job in
a Tory government. Malcolm Rifkind would be shifted to the Home Office and
Kenneth Clarke would get the keys to 11 Downing Street.
But there are other challengers for the Treasury, among them John MacGregor
at Transport. Right-wing Tory MPs - unsure of Major's intentions - have
begun actively to promote the candidatures of Michael Howard at Environment,
Peter Lilley at Social Security and Michael Portillo, the youthful but
fast-rising chief secretary.
But there is general agreement that, should the prime minister decide to
shake-up his team, he has only until the second weekend in January - that's
when the chancellor hosts the traditional Chevening meeting, which signals
the start of serious planning for the budget.
