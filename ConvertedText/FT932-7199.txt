FT  25 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Forte pay committee under spotlight


   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent


FORTE shareholders yesterday asked whether Sir Anthony Tennant was an
appropriate person to chair the group's remuneration committee after the
controversy surrounding his own pay increase.
Sir Anthony, the retiring chairman of Guinness, received a 24 per cent
salary rise in his last year, excluding bonuses, taking his pay to Pounds
777,000.
One shareholder was applauded at Forte's annual general meeting when he
noted the presence of Sir Anthony and Sir Paul Girolami, Glaxo chairman, on
the Forte remuneration committee and asked: 'Would these people have a
realistic idea of what is a fair reward for directors?'
The two were appointed to the Forte board last year. Sir Paul received
Pounds 1.19m from Glaxo in 1992.
Mr Rocco Forte, Forte chairman, strongly defended both non-executive
directors. He said of Sir Anthony: 'It's very unfair to raise the issue. He
deserves every penny.' He said of Sir Paul: 'If we manage to achieve in this
company what Glaxo has achieved, I don't think you would begrudge me that
salary.'
Mr Forte, who added the title of chairman to his previous role of chief
executive last October, received Pounds 251,934 last year, compared with
Pounds 249,721 the previous year. Mr Forte waived an additional Pounds
56,000 last year and Pounds 42,000 the year before.
Mr Forte also defended a Pounds 175,000 incentive payment to Mr Garry
Hawkes, managing director of the Gardner Merchant contract catering
subsidiary which was sold last December.
Mr Forte said the payment was a reward for Mr Hawkes keeping the business
going, maintaining morale and retaining customers during the protracted
negotiations leading up to the sale.
