FT  30 JAN 92 / International Company News: Credit losses hit Swedish banks

TWO of Sweden's leading commercial banks revealed yesterday that mounting
credit losses had made a severe impact on their financial results for 1991.
Svenska Handelsbanken said net operating income was 'somewhat below' SKr3bn
(Dollars 516m) last year. This contrasts with the SKr4.6bn profit it made in
1990. Handelsbanken will publish complete financial results on February 18.
The bank said it expected loan losses of 'slightly over 1 per cent of total
lending'. Handelsbanken has more than doubled its reserves for credit losses
since last autumn to SKr3.5bn.
Handelsbanken blamed the negative trend in loan losses on the finance
company Gamlestaden, rescued from collapse by a Swedish bank consortium last
autumn. It has a negative equity of SKr2.2bn and Handelsbanken estimates its
share of that figure is SKr455m.
Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, Sweden's largest commercial bank, also
reported a deterioration in financial performance with profits falling by 27
per cent to SKr2.4bn for 1991. The bank blamed the decline on escalating
credit losses, including last week's further SKr352m loss from its
involvement in the rescue of Gamlestaden.
The bank said the group's results would have grown favourably during 1991 if
its credit losses were excluded from its figures. The estimated SKr415m loss
resulting from the sale of most of a 28.2 per cent share option in Skandia,
Sweden's leading insurance company, is to be taken against the accounts.
