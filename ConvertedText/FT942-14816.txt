FT  19 APR 94 / Union adverts to cost Pounds 1.25m


   By DAVID GOODHART


Unison, Britain's largest union, is to spend Pounds 1.25m on an advertising
campaign in the run-up to the council elections, highlighting the
government's 'mismanagement' of public services, David Goodhart writes.
The decision will be controversial as the money is coming out of the general
political fund which covers the entire union, including the former Nalgo
local government union which was not affiliated to Labour.
Nalgo had been taken to court in the past by members objecting to its
campaigns which were alleged to have been too political, but at national
level the union was usually found to be on the right side of the law.
Unison has booked almost 1,000 poster sites and has taken advertising space
in national newspapers.
Mr Alan Jinkinson, Unison general secretary, launching the campaign at the
start of the Scottish TUC conference in Dundee yesterday, said: 'We want to
turn the local elections into a referendum on those government policies
which are destroying our public services.'
The advertisements 'won't pull any punches,' he added. The government had
'systematically neglected and starved those vital services for narrow
political objectives'.
