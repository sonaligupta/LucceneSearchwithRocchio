FT  27 OCT 92 / DTI plans business advice network


   By CHARLES BATCHELOR


THE GOVERNMENT will next month announce a radical shake-up ofbusiness
support when it announces details of a planned network of 'one-stop shops'
to provide advice and counselling to businesses.
The advice centres are intended to lead to a streamlining of the range of
existing networks - which many people running small businesses find
confusing - and improve business support.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, plans a network of 200
centres around the country. He will ask the 82 Training and Enterprise
Councils (Tecs) in England and Wales to co-ordinate bids from local
groupings composed of chambers of commerce, local-authority economic
development units, enterprise agencies and others to run between 10 and 15
pilot schemes.
The final deadline for bids is expected to be January and the centres will
begin operations in April. The centres will be set up in business parks or
on the premises of organisations such as the chambers. One of the names
being considered for the new centres is Business Point.
They will employ counsellors to provide detailed advice to businesses, but
their main task will be to help existing small and medium-sized businesses
to grow.
The counsellors will be trained to a high standard and the centres will be
expected to obtain accreditation to the BS5750 quality standard.
The Department of Trade and Industry said the aim was to create a
business-support network equal to or better than that provided by
continental European chambers.
UK chambers are concerned that centres offering free or very cheap advice
would undercut their services, while Tecs want to develop existing
partnerships rather than have a uniform format imposed.
