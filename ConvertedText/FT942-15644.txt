FT  14 APR 94 / People: Cornford's charity


After five years of applying for grants for policy research and development,
James Cornford, director of the left-leaning Institute for Public Policy
Research, has decided to switch to handing out funds.
On August 1, he becomes director of the Paul Hamlyn Foundation, one of the
50 wealthiest charities in the UK.
The foundation was established in 1989 by publisher Paul Hamlyn following
the sale of his interests in the Octopus Group to Reed. His initial gift of
Pounds 50m is now worth more than Pounds 61m, with income of Pounds 4.7m in
1993 and expenditure of Pounds 3.2m.
Cornford, 59, is no stranger to handing out grants; before joining the IPPR,
he was director of the even wealthier Nuffield Foundation. Previously he was
professor of politics at Edinburgh University and has been fellow of Trinity
College, Cambridge, and All Souls, Oxford. He is also chairman of the
Campaign for Freedom of Information.
His five years at the helm of the IPPR have taken it from an idea in the
head of Neil Kinnock, the then Labour leader, to an institute with a staff
of 12 and an income last year of Pounds 0.75m.
The Hamlyn Foundation's projects reflect its founder's interests: arts,
education, book publishing and the third world.
It supports projects ranging from the Royal Opera House Westminster Week (to
encourage first-time visitors to the opera and ballet), to the Jaipur Foot
project in India which fits artificial limbs to the disabled.
The highest profile project supported by the foundation was the National
Commission on Education set up in July 1991 at the instigation of Sir Claus
Moser. This has now completed its work, giving Cornford a relatively clear
field to establish a new generation of projects.
