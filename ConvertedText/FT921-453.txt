FT  28 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Via Baltica - Ballot Box


The election in Scotland is attracting record coverage in Scandinavia. At
Scottish National party meetings away from Edinburgh and Glasgow,
representatives of foreign media often outnumber their UK counterparts three
or four to one.
'People in Denmark aren't interested in the NHS,' said one Danish reporter.
Scotland's possible independence, on the other hand, is almost on a par with
the breakaway Baltic republics.
The Scans have been watching the SNP's progress closely because the party
says Scotland could be part of a future Nordic bloc in the European
Community. Some of their potential partners remain sceptical, however.
'Independence isn't going to happen,' said a Swedish TV commentator, 'but
it's fun watching them try.'
