FT  15 NOV 93 / Arms probe evidence to remain secret


LORD Justice Scott has decided not to publish evidence given by an
intelligence officer which contradicts statements made to the arms-for-Iraq
inquiry by a Foreign Office official.
Lord Justice Scott believes that the government has been over-secretive in
the handling of classified information.
But the judge appears to have become convinced that the public interest
remains best served by making an exception of some intelligence information,
both to protect the safety of his witnesses and to ensure their
co-operation.
The evidence given by an MI6 officer identified only as Mr O was heard at a
private hearing last week after Mr Simon Sherrington, the Foreign Office
official, had agreed to give his evidence in public.
Mr Sherrington said that in October 1989 he had advised the then Foreign
Office minister Mr William Waldegrave that lathes made by the Midlands
company Matrix Churchill were not necessarily defence-related and therefore
not in breach of government guidelines. Mr Sherrington said he had based his
advice on a briefing from his MI6 contact, Mr O.
The intelligence officer was questioned privately by the judge last week
after it emerged that Mr Sherrington's evidence contradicted Mr O's earlier
written submission. It is understood that last week's private hearing has
not resolved the differences.
The public hearings were adjourned last week until November 22.
