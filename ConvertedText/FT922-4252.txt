FT  06 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the Markets): Copper
market outlook brightens


   By RICHARD MOONEY


THE OUTLOOK brightened for copper producers this week as prices on the
London Metal Exchange broke out of the recent narrow trading range to reach
the highest level for seven months in dollar terms.
Declining stocks levels, growing hopes of US economic recovery and the
approach of North American labour contract negotiations combined to push the
LME three months delivery price through resistance at the equivalent of
Dollars 2,260 a tonne early in the week.
After consolidating in the higher range the market was given a further boost
on Thursday by news that Codelco, Chile's state-owned copper corporation,
had been forced by heavy rain temporarily to close the world's biggest open
pit mine at Chuquicamata, which produced more than 200,000 tonnes of refined
copper in the first four months of this year.
In addition the corporation announced the second closure in less than a week
at its Quebrada open pit mine, this time because of heavy snow. The mine
normally accounts for about 20 per cent of the 8,500 tonnes-a-month
production of Codelco's El Salvador division.
The Chuquicamata news came after the LME close on Thursday, but New York
prices surged to life-of-contract highs in response and yesterday morning
the LME three months price climbed to Dollars 2,278 a tonne before running
into Chinese selling.
By the close the price was up Pounds 5.50 on the day and Pounds 18.25 on the
week at Pounds 1,257.75, a tonne, equivalent to Dollars 2,276 a tonne. In
sterling terms that was well below the Pounds 1,335 a tonne reached three
months ago, but sterling was much lower then compared with the US currency
and that price worked out at only Dollars 2,258 a tonne.
The more hopeful mood in the copper market was reflected in this week's
issue of London trader Rudolf Wolff's Copper Outlook news letter. 'The
outlook for copper is one of optimism as the fundamentals are improving and
the technical picture looks bullish,' Wolff said.
'Overall, the improved US economic situation is expected to provide a firm
base to underpin the market. The ongoing shortfalls in supply, especially
with the uncertainty surrounding aspects of CIS production/exports and over
the level of Yugoslavian exports (estimated at around 50,000 tonnes in 1991)
following trade sanctions, should prompt renewed consumer interest. In
addition to the projected supply deficit, growing confidence for economic
recovery in the US and parts of Europe should prompt restocking.'
Despite copper's stronger performance the lead market stole the honours for
the week's biggest rise with a Pounds 13.25, or 4.4 per cent, advance to
Pounds 313.50 a tonne in the three months position. Most of the rise took
place on Thursday and in the absence of fundamental factors was attributed
to investment fund buying, topped up by stop-loss purchases.
In the zinc market the concern about the availability of metal to cover June
options declarations was still evident, although bearish fundamentals were
reflected in an overall downward price trend. The cash price closed
yesterday at Dollars 1,445 a tonne, up Dollars 2.50 on the week, but the
three months price fell Dollars 22 to Dollars 1,262.50 a tonne, widening the
cash premium to Dollars 182.50.
Tin prices reached 20-month highs early in the week on European trade
buying, which also sparked off covering by holders of short positions and
triggered stop loss buying orders. But hopes of breaching resistance at
Dollars 6,500 a tonne for three months metal were disappointed. The price
touched that level on Wednesday before sliding back to Dollars 6,467.50 a
tonne, up Dollars 190 on the week.
Hopes that the coffee market would consolidate the gains made on Friday of
last week were also disappointed. There was no follow-through to that
upturn, which had been prompted by producer members of the International
Coffee Organisation agreeing an, admittedly vague, quota plan for
presentation at the ICO council meeting on June 22-26. The London Futures
and Options Exchange's September position ended the week Dollars 16 down at
Dollars 730 a tonne.
New York sugar futures moved up strongly on Thursday, influenced by
investment fund buying, technical factors and talk of a pick-up in demand
for white sugar on the world market. But the London market response
yesterday was muted. In late trading the October position was at Dollars
216.80 a tonne up 40 cents on the day at Dollars 8.40 on the week.
