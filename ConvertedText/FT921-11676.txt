FT  30 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): RSI victim accepts pay-off


   By CATHERINE MILTON


A FORMER legal secretary who was dismissed after she developed repetitive
strain injury (RSI) yesterday said she had accepted a payment of Pounds
5,500 from the company against which she had claimed unfair dismissal.
Autoglass, a replacement windscreen company based in Bedford, dismissed Mrs
Denise Burgess last July, five months after she developed RSI - the
condition which is increasingly associated with computer keyboard use.
The tribunal case was settled before the hearing. Autoglass yesterday
refused to comment on the case.
Last month two former BT keyboard operators won Pounds 6,000 damages for
pain and suffering caused by RSI.
Financial Times journalists yesterday demanded an independent inquiry into
the allegedly high incidence of RSI at the newspaper. The National Union of
Journalists is in dispute with FT management over moves to retire
compulsorily nine journalists on ill-health grounds.
