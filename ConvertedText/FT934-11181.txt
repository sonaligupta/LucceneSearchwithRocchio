FT  02 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Strong argument for relaxed
management style


   From Dr GEORGE FIELDMAN


Sir, The psychological research published in the FT (Recruitment, October
27) on problem-solving styles indicated that a goal-orientated or telic
approach is less productive than an interest-orientated or paratelic
approach. This finding is fascinating indeed and, if confirmed by other
studies, has important implications both for managers and for management
training.
It is a powerful argument for relaxed management styles which encourage
staff to follow their own insights and intuitions, at least for tasks which
involve problem-solving. Such an approach is also likely to reduce
psychological strain in staff which, in turn, should promote their physical
and psychological well-being.
So much then for the dogged Thatcherite influence upon management. In this
view external pressure was seen as the principal means of promoting British
economic productivity; what an appalling waste that may have turned out to
be. Of course, the notion that people can be brow-beaten into world-class
performance always lacked credibility.
