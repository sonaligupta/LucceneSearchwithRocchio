FT  23 JUL 93 / Proposals for improving M25


Even before the M25 was fully opened in 1986, its traffic jams had become
the butt of standup comedians. The busiest sections near Heathrow in the
west, between junctions 12 and 16, carry up to 200,000 vehicles a day,
although each section was intended to take 80,000.
Proposals put forward yesterday are:
To build three-lane link roads along each side of the present four-lane
motorway between Junctions 12 and 15 near Heathrow Airport and Staines, at a
cost of Pounds 144m. A public inquiry starts next summer and the roads could
be built by the end of the 1990s.
To build two-lane link roads between junctions 15 and 16 near the M40 at a
cost of Pounds 52m. A public consultation was announced yesterday.
To widen the existing three-lane motorway between junctions 7 and 8 and
junctions 10 and 11 to four lanes, as part of plans to widen the whole
motorway to four lanes in each direction announced in the 1989 roads white
paper.
The total of all improvements planned, including expanding the whole orbit
to four lanes, is expected to be about Pounds 1bn, the Department of
Transport said yesterday.
