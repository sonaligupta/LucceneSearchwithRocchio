FT  21 NOV 92 / Briefcase, Q&A: Caught in the net


RECENTLY, I bought some Bradford & Bingley PIBS (Permanent Interest-Bearing
Shares) halfway through the dividend period. I paid my broker for these and
for the gross interest accrued from the previous dividend date.
When I receive my dividend in three months' time, it will be paid net. How
do I recover the tax deducted for the period when I was not the holder of
the shares? And how is the tax on the interest adjusted?
It all depends on what you mean by 'some.' If this indicates an amount less
than Pounds 5,000.01, then the answer hinges on whether, on at least one day
in 1991-92 or 1992-93, your total nominal holdings of securities covered by
the accrued income scheme (AIS) amounted to at least Pounds 5,000.01 (using
the London closing rate of exchange for each day to translate nominal
amounts expressed in a foreign currency.) The AIS is outlined in a free
pamphlet, IR68 (Accrued Income Scheme: Taxing Securities on Transfer), which
is obtainable from your tax office.
But if 'some' means an amount less than Pounds 5,000.01, and you do not meet
the overall Pounds 5,000.01 test at any time between April 6 1991 and April
5 1993 (inclusive), then not entitled to the benefit of the AIS.
