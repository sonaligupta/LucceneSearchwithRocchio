FT  08 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Senate threat to Uruguay Round


   By NANCY DUNNE


   WASHINGTON


Legislation to implement the Uruguay Round trade treaty is in danger of
failing in the US Senate when members of both houses return for a special
post-election session later this month. This was the view put forward
yesterday by the business group dedicated to getting the accord passed.
The Alliance for Gatt Now published a list of 45 senators who could vote
against either a budget waiver, which is needed before the legislation could
come to the floor, or Gatt itself. Sixty of the 100 senators must vote in
favour if there is to be a waiver of the budget rules. The implementing
legislation alone needs only a simple majority.
Ms Liese Wright, a Gatt Now official, warned the situation could change
quickly. The coalition was 'pleased that Gatt did not become an election
issue', but worried about the effects of any Republican takeover of the
Senate.
Senator Robert Dole, the Republican leader, is on the list of those who
might vote against the waiver. The administration fears he will block Gatt
to appeal to the Republicans opposed to liberalised trade.
Some in the opposition see publication of the list as a fundraising ploy.
The coalition in favour of Gatt hopes to raise enough money to support a
advertising campaign to explain how delay would affect the the eight-year
effort to free world trade.
