FT  21 APR 94 / UK bankers to advise Russians


   By LEYLA BOULTON


   MOSCOW


British merchant banks are to advise privatised Russian companies on how to
attract investment finance through new share offerings under a Pounds
3m-Pounds 4m scheme financed by the British government's Know-How Fund. The
pilot project unveiled in Moscow yesterday will also help Russian
authorities complete legislation regulating capital increases and a
secondary market in securities. The merchant banks - Samuel Montagu,
Kleinwort Benson, and Hambros - together with accounting and management
firms - Ernst & Young, and Deloitte & Touche  - will select companies on a
competitive basis. They expect to pick one or two companies in each of five
Russian cities - Moscow, St Petersburg, Yekaterinburg, Perm, and
Nizhny-Novgorod. The plan is part of a campaign to help companies attract
finance following the sale of their shares for 'privatisation vouchers'
distributed free to Russia's 150m citizens.
