FT  20 APR 91 / UK Company News: NatWest cuts syndicated loans division by
20%


   By SARA WEBB


National Westminster Bank is cutting 17 jobs in its syndicated loans
division, which was one of the largest in the City.
They include a handful of managers as well as administrative staff. Mr
Trevor Bush, senior director of asset sales and distribution at NatWest,
said the cuts meant roughly a 20 per cent reduction and that staff who lost
their jobs would be re-employed elsewhere in the organisation. He said the
bank planned to adopt a more aggressive strategy in selling credit.
The cuts are part of a wider reorganisation of the bank's activities,
bringing capital markets and syndicated loans business under the treasury
department. NatWest decided last August to cut 300 of the 3,000 jobs in its
corporate and institutional banking division. Most of the cuts will take
place in London over the next two years. The bank said 100 jobs had been cut
already, but some staff have been redeployed.
