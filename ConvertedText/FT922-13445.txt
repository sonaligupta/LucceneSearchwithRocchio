FT  11 APR 92 / Finance & The Family: Main points of the Lamont Budget


The return of John Major means that investors are now certain to see the
implementation of the measures announced in Norman Lamont's Budget. For
those who, punch-drunk with election claim and counter-claim, have forgotten
the essential measures, we print below a summary of the key provisions. Most
have already passed into law; the last few will need renewed legislation.
A new lower rate of income tax of 20p in the pound on the first Pounds 2,000
of taxable income.
Basic rate and higher rate taxes unchanged at 25 and 40 per cent
respectively. The threshold for higher rate tax is unchanged at Pounds
23,700 of taxable income.
The married couple's allowance will be frozen at Pounds 1,720 this year.
Single person's allowance increased, with inflation, from Pounds 3,295 to
Pounds 3,445.

will be raised from Pounds 3,000 to Pounds 6,000.
Measures the government can now enact
The threshold for inheritance tax will rise by more than inflation to Pounds
150,000.
The married couple's allowance will be payable to either partner, or they
can have half each, from April 1993.
Owner-occupied farmlands, farm tenancies, interests in un-incorporated
businesses, and holdings of over 25 per cent in unquoted and USM companies
will be exempt from inheritance tax. Relief from inheritance tax at 50 per
cent will apply to controlling holdings in fully quoted companies, holdings
of under 35 per cent in unquoted and USM companies, interests of landlords
in let farmlands and certain other business assets.
The rules on mortgage rescue schemes using the business expansion scheme
will be eased, and the BES for trading companies will be scrapped from the
end of 1993.
