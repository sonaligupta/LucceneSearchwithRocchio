FT  20 MAY 92 / April PSBR of Pounds 3.6bn


THE public-sector bor-rowing requirement for April was Pounds 3.6bn,
including privatisation proceeds of Pounds 0.6bn. That is the biggest
deficit for April since 1987.
The figure was slightly lower than expected but economists warned that
Britain was still heading for a record deficit in fiscal 1992-93. Most
expect the PSBR in the new financial year - which started in April - to
reach Pounds 30bn.
