FT  28 MAR 92 / Algeria to release some detainees


The Algerian authorities yesterday announced that they would release some of
the 6,786 people 'administratively' detained in five internment camps in the
Sahara desert, writes Francis Ghiles.
Amnesty International said the high cost and length of time necessary for
the journeys make it virtually impossible for families to visit detainees.
