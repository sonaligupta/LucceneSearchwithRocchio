FT  20 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Jarvis sets new date for annual meeting


Jarvis, the building, civil engineering and property group, is having to set
another date for its annual meeting. The meeting was scheduled for yesterday
but the company was informed that it had not given sufficient notice.
A notice convening a new meeting will be issued in the next few days.
The company also responded to a number of critical comments made by a
shareholder, and sent to other shareholders, concerning the company's poor
performance and last year's Pounds 2.4m rights issue.
While regretting the performance - 1993 pre-tax losses were Pounds 3.15m
(Pounds 3.72m) - it rejected the criticisms, adding that other companies and
individuals mentioned were taking legal advice.
