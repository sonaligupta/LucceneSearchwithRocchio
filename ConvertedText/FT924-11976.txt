FT  23 OCT 92 / International Company News: Repola cuts net losses to FM415m
after 8 months

   STOCKHOLM


REPOLA, the Finnish forestry and engineering group, made a FM415m (Dollars
87m) loss for the first eight months of the year, compared with a FM607m
deficit in the same period of 1991.
It achieved a 7 per cent increase in consolidated net sales to FM14.95bn
from FM13.92bn, and an operating profit of FM818m, nearly double the 1991
figure of FM426m.
Repola said that it would make a financial loss for the whole of 1992
because of the weakening of the Finnish markka since it was floated on
September 8. On the day of the float, the company's net liabilities in
foreign currencies totalled FM5.5bn. Repola said the increase in its export
revenues would cover exchange losses in less than a year.
The company forecast a further improvement in its operating profit during
the last four months of 1992.
It added that shutdowns during the summer had brought a further loss to
Repola. But the present results were 'a clear improvement' on the same
period of 1991, despite an oversupply of printing papers which had kept
capacity utilisation rates low, reduced newsprint prices, a slack demand for
investment and the higher cost of financing.
In its forestry activities the company made a profit after financial items
of FM121m for the first eight months, compared with a FM323m loss for the
same period last year. Net sales rose by 2 per cent to FM 8.92bn from FM
8.73bn.
