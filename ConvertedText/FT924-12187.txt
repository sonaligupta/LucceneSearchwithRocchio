FT  22 OCT 92 / Canadians called to order


   By ROBERT GIBBENS


   MONTREAL


ONE OF Canada's most influential businessmen entered the constitutional fray
yesterday. He urged his countrymen to end the 'paralysing and debilitating'
debate on the constitution and vote 'Yes' in next Monday's referendum on a
package of reforms known as the Charlottetown Accord.
Mr Paul Desmarais, head of Power Corp of Canada, said the accord was a
unique opportunity to give Canada a political and economic framework to face
a fast-changing inter-dependent world.
In an editorial in La Presse, French Canada's most important daily newspaper
and owned by Power Corp, Mr Desmarais urged Canadians to put aside petty
politics and see the deal as 'a consensus among 13 governments and four
aboriginal groups, each answerable to its electorate and public opinion'. To
continue the 30-year search for constitutional perfection would just be
utopian.
'The accord gives everyone significant gains and Canadians and Quebeckers
will continue to benefit from participation in the federation. No province
or group is compromised and it is an equitable agreement. Quebec's place in
the federation is assured.'
Mr Desmarais, Ontario-born and educated, built his financial services,
communications and industrial empire from Montreal. He said Canada had to
end the constitutional crisis now and work to restore a productive and
world-competitive economy. Otherwise, it could not maintain its social and
political systems intact.
