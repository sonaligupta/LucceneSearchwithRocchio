Northern Telecom, the Canadian telecommunications equipment supplier, has
won its largest contract in Latin America with an agreement to install a
USDollars 350m digital phone network in Colombia.
The contract takes the form of a revenue-sharing agreement with Empresa
Nacional de Telecommunicacions, Colombia's state telephone utility, and
Vestcor Partners, a Miami-based investment bank, which put together the
financing structure.
Under the agreement, Northern Telecom will be paid for its equipment from
revenues generated from the network over the next nine years.
The contract includes 205,000 digital phone lines in 10 regions of Colombia,
as well as transmission equipment and microwave systems. Northern Telecom
will operate the system.
Northern Telecom said the company also expected to win contracts for
cellular phone equipment in Colombia within the next few weeks.
Last month, a consortium comprising Northern Telecom's sister company, Bell
Canada International, as well as Northern Telecom and the Bogota city phone
company, was granted a cellular phone franchise in the eastern region of
Colombia, including Bogota.
Northern Telecom will provide switching and cellular equipment for the
Dollars 400m project.
Several European suppliers have recently won contracts to install telephone
equipment in other parts of Colombia in line with a recent liberalisation of
the procurement process.
