FT  22 OCT 94 / Mates may sue


Mr Michael Mates - the former Northern Ireland minister who left the
government over his links with fugitive businessman Mr Asil Nadir - is
considering suing some newspapers for libel.
Solicitors Denton Hall, for Mr Mates, said yesterday that a number of
articles had contained allegations of parliamentary or financial
irregularity or moral impropriety by MPs and some had referred to Mr Mates
in this context.
'Mr Mates takes the greatest exception to such inferences since at the time
of his resignation both the prime minister and the attorney-general
specifically stated that he had acted with complete propriety,' Denton Hall
said.
