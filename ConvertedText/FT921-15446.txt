FT  10 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Jones Stroud sees better second half


JONES STROUD (Holdings) reported an 8 per cent fall in interim pre-tax
profits. However, this maker of accessories and materials for the textile
and electrical industries said there had been some improvement in trading
and expected full year profits to be ahead of last year's Pounds 4.49m.
In the six months to September 30 profits were Pounds 2.49m (Pounds 2.7m) on
turnover of Pounds 31.9m (Pounds 30.1m). Most of the fall was the result of
a turnround from interest received of Pounds 52,000 to a charge of Pounds
104,000.
Earnings per share came out at 9.19p (9.53p) and the interim dividend is
maintained at 3p.
