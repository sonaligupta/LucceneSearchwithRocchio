FT  02 JUL 92 / UK Company News: In Shops drops plans to bid for Amber Day


   By ANDREW BOLGER


Shares in Amber Day fell 9p to 41p after In Shops, the Birmingham-based
stores group, said it had decided against proceeding with any offer for the
discount retailer.
In Shops halted the recent slide in Amber Day's share price on Monday when
it said it might make a bid. However, it decided against proceeding 'after
consultation with advisers and having taken account of the views of
shareholders.' In Shops shares closed 6p higher at 81p.
The much greater size of Amber Day meant that In Shops' expression of
interest was greeted sceptically in the City. The potential bidder's
institutional shareholders were reluctant to pursue Amber Day, which has
seen its share price collapse from 126p following criticism concerning Mr
Philip Green, chairman and chief executive.
Amber Day shares were also hit last month by a profits downgrading and the
departure of the finance director and only non-executive director.
