The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) team inspecting nuclear
facilities in North Korea has been obstructed in its work, the organisation
said yesterday, Patrick Blum reports from Vienna. 'Restrictions were
applied, stopping us making some tests,' the IAEA said last night.
The team which spent 15 days in North Korea was able to visit all seven
declared nuclear facilities as agreed with Pyongyang last month. One of the
plants where the experts faced curbs was at the main nuclear complex at
Yongbyon, north of the capital. The team will report back this morning. A
formal IAEA board meeting could be called next week.
