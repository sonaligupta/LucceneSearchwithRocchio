Nine people were killed yesterday in artillery duels between Serbs and
Croats which spread across Croatia and into the neighbouring republic of
Bosnia-Hercegovina, Reuter reports from Zagreb. The death toll has now
reached 19 in worsening skirmishes since Sunday, just weeks before the main
body of a 14,000-strong United Nations force arrives in Yugoslavia.
