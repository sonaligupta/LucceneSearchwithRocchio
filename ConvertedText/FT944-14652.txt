FT  21 OCT 94 / International Company News: Kodak to spend Dollars 370m in
early debt pay-off


   By RICHARD WATERS


Eastman Kodak said yesterday that it would cost around Dollars 370m for the
company to pay off much of its debt early, together with a large portfolio
of derivative instruments.
The US photographic products company said that holders of Dollars 2.7bn of
its bonds had agreed to sell back their securities to the company. In all,
it had tendered for Dollars 4.8bn worth of bonds.
Kodak put the premium to buy back this debt at around Dollars 150m. US
interest rates have fallen since the fixed-rate instruments were issued,
making them worth a premium to their face value.
In addition, Kodak said it had now unwound most of its interest rate swaps,
derivative instruments which had been used to lower the overall cost of the
debt.
The cost of shedding these instruments, together with option contracts which
have been unwound so far, was Dollars 220m, Kodak said.
In all, Kodak had derivatives with a nominal value of Dollars 7bn backing
its debt, making this one of the biggest balance sheet reorganisations of
its kind ever undertaken.
