Allianz, Europe's largest insurance company, yesterday announced plans for a
DM1.56bn (Dollars 910m) rights issue in May, to bring its share capital in
line with a strong increase in business volume.
At the same time, the Munich-based insurer announced an increase in its
dividend to DM15 from DM13.50 in 1992.
The rights issue will also help the company prepare for the liberalisation
of the European insurance market, it said.
The 15-for-one issue will raise the capital stock to DM1.04bn from DM975m,
the announcement said. Shareholders will be offered the new shares at a
price of DM1,200.
