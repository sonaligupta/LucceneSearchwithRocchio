FT  30 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow consolidates Thursday's
gains


   By PATRICK HARVERSON

Wall Street
US SHARE prices mostly traded in a narrow range on either side of opening
values as investors consolidated the gains earned during Thursday's
record-breaking rally, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 7.27 at 3,680.59,
and the more broadly based Standard & Poor's 500 up 0.11 at 467.84.
Secondary indices fared better, with the Amex composite finishing up 4.09 at
481.44, and the Nasdaq composite up 5.77 at 779.26. Trading volume on the
NYSE was 266m shares.
After Thursday's big advance, when the Dow rose to a new record high of
3,687.86 on news of stronger-than-expected third quarter economic growth,
investors took a breather yesterday. Some chose to take some of the profits
earned earlier in the week, while others decided to sit out the session and
await the markets' next decisive move.
Weakness in bond prices (the yield on the 30-year bond ended the day up at
5.967 per cent) also contributed to the subdued opening of equities trading.
The declines in Treasury prices were sparked by the day's only economic news
 -an increase in the Chicago Association of Purchasing Management's index of
manufacturing activity from 54.5 in September to 57.0 in October.
That news, plus gains on foreign stock markets, ensured that profit-taking
did not make a big dent in share prices during the day.
Among individual stocks, Eastman Kodak, which had jumped sharply on the news
that Motorola's chairman Mr George Fisher had been hired as the company's
new chief executive, gave back Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 63. In contrast,
Motorola, which fell on the news, recovered Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 104 3/4
. Xerox continued to benefit from positive reaction to its third quarter
results, rising another Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 79 1/4 .
General Motors was hard hit by profit-taking, declining Dollars 1 3/8 to
Dollars 47 5/8 , as were Chrysler, down Dollars 1 at Dollars 56 and Ford,
off Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 61 7/8 , all in heavy trading.
Brokerage stocks were in demand. Merrill Lynch climbed Dollars 1 3/4 to
Dollars 96 7/8 , Morgan Stanley rose Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 78 5/8 ,
Salomon added Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 45 1/4 , Charles Schwab put on Dollars
2 1/8 at Dollars 34 1/2 and PaineWebber firmed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 29
3/8 .
Exide enjoyed a strong debut on the NYSE, the battery maker's stock rising
from an offer price of Dollars 20 to Dollars 26 7/8 in volume of 3.8m
shares.
Aetna climbed Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 65 3/4 on news of improved third
quarter earnings.
On the Nasdaq market Microsoft rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 80 1/8 and Dell
Computer added Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 20 1/4 . Canada
TORONTO prices closed solidly higher in moderate end-of-the-week trading, as
a late-session rally propelled the TSE-300 composite index to another record
high. It rose 20.37 points, or 0.48 per cent, to close at 4,255.61 above the
previous peak of 4,235.24 achieved yesterday.
