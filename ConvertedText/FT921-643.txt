FT  27 MAR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar rises in light activity


   By ANDREW JACK


THE DOLLAR regained some of its recent loss against the D-Mark in London
yesterday in the quietest trading reported in several weeks, and in spite of
the release of poor economic data, writes Andrew Jack.
The US Labor Department released figures showing the number of people
registering for unemployment insurance rose by 15,000 to 447,000, against
market expectations of nearer 440,000. Revised gross domestic product
statistics for the fourth quarter of last year were also disappointing, with
growth reported at 0.4 per cent compared with the 0.8 per cent previously
published.
But the effect was short-lived, with the US currency soon rising again to
end in London at DM1.6615/25 and Y133.85/95, against DM1.6520 and Y133.35 at
the previous close. Later in New York it finished at DM1.6615 and Y134.05.
Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Yamaichi Bank in London, said: 'The
dollar is a bit perkier. It managed to shrug off the data.' He added that
the markets had already absorbed the impact of these figures and were
waiting for a fresh crop on the US economy due next week.
It may also have been helped by bullish speeches from Mr Edward Kelley,
Federal Reserve governor, and Mr Nicholas Brady, US Treasury Secretary, who
argued that US economic recovery was well on its way.
The Swiss franc dropped sharply against the dollar in New York, when the
D-Mark/Swiss franc cross-rate broke through resistance at 91 centimes. Most
traders were reported as buying into D-Marks, and then switched to buying
dollars against the Swiss franc.
In Asian trading, the dollar had slipped against the yen late in the day on
speculative sales and stop-loss orders, closing down at Y133.20 but up on
the D-Mark at DM1.6528.
Sterling closed 90 basis points down at Dollars 1.7225 in London,
relinquishing Wednesday's rise. Against the D-Mark it improved from DM2.8600
to DM2.8625. The pound's exchange rate index was unchanged at 90.1.
Dealers said a group of US funds helped to lift the dollar in modest late
trade as programme trading was carried out based on technical analysis of
market trends. 'Apart from this late burst, it has been one of the quietest
days I can remember,' one dealer told Reuter.
They maintained that the effects of the political uncertainty would have
little effect on the pound, as it was being discounted through the money
markets instead.
Mr Neil MacKinnon of Yamaichi commented: 'Sterling is an icon of stability
in contrast to equities and gilts. It has been able to absorb fairly
changeable opinion polls. It is pinned firmly to the floor. Cutting base
rates would be a necessary condition to lift it.'
