FT  28 MAR 92 / Letter: Many UK employers strongly support a minimum wage


   From Sir SIGMUND STERNBERG


Sir, As the controversy over the minimum wage continues, it would be
unfortunate if the impression took hold that all - or even most - employers
are hostile to it.
Many employers strongly support the principle of a floor to wages. Good
employers have nothing to fear from a minimum wage, particularly one set at
the modest level of Pounds 3.40, and much to gain.
Nor does Britain have anything to fear from a minimum wage that merely
brings us into line with our European partners, nearly all of which have
lower rates of unemployment and higher skills levels than we do. They have
understood better than our own government that a minimum wage improves
standards in industry by preventing the bad employer from undercutting the
good, and that its absence is likely to impede rather than promote
investment.
Two aspects remain significant about this debate. One is that all polling
confirms that a majority even of Conservative voters support the
introduction of a minimum wage at Pounds 3.40, despite the best efforts of
the government. The second is that the debate remains precisely similar to
the debates which took place before the introduction of equal pay
legislation and of legislation on child labour. The critics of reform were
wrong then when they forecast that equal pay laws would force women out of
the labour force - and they are wrong now.
I only wish that ministers took as much trouble trying to improve Britain's
desperately poor record on training as they do trying to maintain pay at
levels that have no place in a modern society.
