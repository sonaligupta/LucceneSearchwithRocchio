FT  23 APR 93 / International Company News: Amdahl to cut another 1,000 jobs


   By LOUISE KEHOE and REUTER


AMDAHL, one of IBM's largest competitors in the mainframe computer market,
said it would cut its workforce by another 1,000, in addition to the 1,000
jobs already cut over the past six months.
The company employs about 8,500 people, about 5,000 of them in California.
The reduction will be completed in late May.
Amdahl said it needed to consolidate its operations in view of 'erratic'
markets.
The company said that demand for its mainframe computers and related
products dropped sharply in last year's third quarter, only to surge in the
fourth and then decline significantly in early 1993.
Last month, Amdahl warned that its first-quarter results, due to be released
next week, would be considerably below analysts' estimates. Last week, IBM
also reported a 'high double-digit' decline in sales of mainframe computers
and related data storage devices in its latest quarterly report.
Amdahl said excess production capacity within the industry has contributed
to severe price competition recently. In contrast to the problems of Amdahl
and IBM, EMC, the leading manufacturer of disk arrays, a lower-cost
alternative to traditional mainframe data storage systems, yesterday
reported strong sales and earnings for its first quarter. EMC said that
sales increased to Dollars 130.7m from Dollars 65.7m , while income for the
quarter was Dollars 14.9m, or 32 cents a share, up from Dollars 5.2m, or 13
cents.
IBM Personal Software Products division has named Mr William Rich as general
manager in charge of worldwide sales and marketing, Reuter reports.
Mr David Proctor has been named vice-president of products. He was formerly
president of Xerox Computer Services. Proctor will be based in Austin,
Texas.
