FT  19 APR 91 / International Company News: Time Warner posts slight slip
after merger costs

TIME WARNER, the world's biggest media and entertainment company, yesterday
posted a slight decline in first-quarter operating income, with softness at
the company's publishing and music operations offsetting gains from its film
and cable television operations.
Expenses related to the 1989 merger of Time Life and Warner Communications
pushed the company into the red for the quarter. Time Warner's net loss for
the three months ended March 31 was Dollars 50m or Dollars 3.39 a share
after preferred dividend requirements compared with a deficit of Dollars 51m
or Dollars 3.25 a share in 1990.
Revenues advanced 4 per cent to Dollars 2.84bn from Dollars 2.74bn. The
results were muddied by interest expenses and amortisation costs related to
Time Warner's Dollars 11bn of debt, which the company has been charging off
each quarter. Time Warner's operating income slid 1 per cent to Dollars 530m
in the first three months of 1991.
The company blamed economic softness and a drop in advertising revenue for
the 41 per cent slump in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortisation to Dollars 42m from its publishing operations.
Earnings before expenses from Time Warner's music business fell 8 per cent
to Dollars 137m in the quarter, which the company attributed to soft retail
sales and start-up investments. However, earnings from filmed entertainment
operations rose 3 per cent to Dollars 95m, with lower US cinema revenues
more than offset by record results from syndication and home video sales.
