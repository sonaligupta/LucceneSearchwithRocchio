FT  07 JAN 94 / Sports Council rejects criticisms


   By JAMES BLITZ


Officials at the Sports Council, the government body set up to develop
sporting activity, yesterday defended themselves against allegations of
extravagance and poor administration amid signs that these criticisms will
be highlighted next week.
The National Audit Office, the government's accounting watchdog, is to issue
a report examining whether the council has provided value for money in
recent years. The details of the report remain secret, but members of the
Commons public accounts committee and the NAO are concerned that the council
has been lax in its administration of some assets.
MPs have raised concern that nearly a third of the council's overall income
last year was spent on administrative costs and staff salaries.
At the heart of the watchdog's concern is the council's policy of farming
out the management of assets, including some sports centres, to a charitable
trust called the Sports Council Trust Company.
Last month the NAO pointed out that, if the trust company sold any of these
assets, the council might not be able to ensure that it received the
proceeds from the trust in order to pass them back to the exchequer.
The council said the administration costs reflected the activity of an
organisation which supports local authorities and voluntary bodies
throughout the country.
