FT  28 JUL 92 / International Company News: Dow Corning's earnings fall


   By KAREN ZAGOR


   NEW YORK


DOW Corning, the 50-50 joint venture between Dow Chemical and Corning,
yesterday reported a 19 per cent drop in underlying second-quarter net
income to Dollars 36m on sales that rose 5.7 per cent to Dollars 488.4m.
A large one-time charge related to the company's silicone breast implant
business depressed the company's reported net earnings even further,
contributing to an 84 per cent decline to Dollars 6.3m.
In the 1991 second quarter, Dow Corning had net income of Dollars 40.5m on
sales of Dollars 462.1m.
The results had little impact on Dow Chemical and Corning's shares, which
respectively eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 54 7/8 and held steady at Dollars
36 1/4 at midday.
Mr Edward Steinhoff, Dow Corning's chief financial officer, said operating
profits fell on the back of slower than expected growth. 'Our sales grew,
although we didn't achieve the price increases we needed.'
