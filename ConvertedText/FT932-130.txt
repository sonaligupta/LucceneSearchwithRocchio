FT  30 JUN 93 / Observer: Loose connection


'How's the work going?', Lancaster University's professor of economics Jim
Taylor asked a colleague struggling to meet a deadline. The FT man replied
that, as usual, he was finding it hard to write words that made sense. 'Oh
no,' said the professor. 'Every single word you write makes perfect sense to
me. It's the way you put them together that's confusing.'
