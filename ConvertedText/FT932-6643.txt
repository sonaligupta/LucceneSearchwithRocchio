FT  27 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Capital Radio turns in Pounds 4.7m


   By CATHERINE MILTON


A VOTE of confidence from London's popular music lovers could not stop
accountants forcing pre-tax profits at Capital Radio, the London commercial
music station, down from Pounds 6.29m to Pounds 4.65m in the six months to
March 31.
The comparative figure was distorted by the inclusion of a Pounds 2.18m gain
on a disposal taken to comply with the new FRS 3 accounting standard, which
disguised an underlying improvement of 13 per cent.
Mr Ian Irvine, chairman, stressed that adult Londoners preferred Capital FM
to Classic FM, BBC Radios 4 and 1. It continued as market leader with 32 per
cent of the adult listeners tuning in each week.
However, he said that 'while we are enthusiastic about the prospects in the
medium to long term, we continue to take a cautious view of the immediate
future.'
The company said that almost flat turnover of Pounds 16.1m (Pounds 16.2m),
which included agency commissions, disguised an improvement in Capital
Radio's sales to Pounds 14.5m (Pounds 14.2m). National advertising revenue
was static but there was a 'considerable increase' in local advertising
revenue.
Turnover at Capital Group Studios fell to Pounds 1m (Pounds 1.2m) and the
company broke even, compared with a profit of Pounds 200,000.
Operating costs fell to Pounds 10.4m (Pounds 11.1m) including the benefit of
a February decision by the Copyright Tribunal which reduced Capital Radio's
effective royalty payments to Phonographic Performance Limited, the
representative of record companies, from 6.5 per cent to 5 per cent of
turnover.
Interest receivable fell to Pounds 795,000 (Pounds 810,000).
An accelerated unchanged interim dividend of 1.75p was paid on April 5.
Earnings declined to 4.6p (6.3p).
