FT  22 OCT 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool


Prices in the main primary markets are only just holding steady, after
tending easier for most of the week. The Australian Wool Corporation's
market indicator has fallen to another new low point for this season, at 506
cents a kg. The trade has noted that some woolgrowers withdrew thier wool
from the sale before it started yesterday, in addition to some large
percentages passed in at growers' reserves during the sale. On some previous
occasions a weak market has led to this approach, as dissatisfaction with
selling prices develops.
