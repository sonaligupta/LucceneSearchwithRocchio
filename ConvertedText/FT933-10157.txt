FT  05 AUG 93 / International Company News: US side fails to offset Akzo
weakness


   By RONALD VAN DE KROL

AKZO, the Dutch chemicals group, reported a 30 per cent decline in
second-quarter profit as better results in the US failed to compensate for
the continued downturn in Europe.
It warned it would be difficult in the second half to match the year-ago
results.
In the second quarter, net profit fell to Fl 152m (Dollars 78m) from Fl
218.3m, on turnover down 4 per cent at Fl 4.13bn. The decline was due partly
to extraordinary charges of Fl 28m earmarked for restructuring programmes,
mainly in the fibre sector. If extraordinary items are excluded, net profit
declined 17 per cent.
Pharmaceuticals was the only division to report a small increase in
operating profit. Chemicals, coating and fibres all posted profit declines.
Mr Syb Bergsma, board member, said Akzo would be put at a short-term
disadvantage by the effective abandonment of the European exchange rate
mechanism. In the first half, turnover was depressed by Fl 100m because of
last autumn's declines in the value of the pound, the lira and the peseta.
