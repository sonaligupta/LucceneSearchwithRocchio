   BUDAPEST


SALGGLAS, Hungary's state-owned glassmaker, has failed to reach an
agree-ment with creditors and will be liquidated, Mr Sandor Toth, chief
executive, said, Reuter reports from Budapest.
Salgglas  - Hungary's sole maker of automotive glass and a major exporter of
sheet glass  - sought bankruptcy protection in April to seek a way of
settling its debt of 1.3bn forints (Dollars 17m), half of which is owed to
four local banks.
