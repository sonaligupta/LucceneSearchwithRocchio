FT  13 NOV 92 / China condemns Hong Kong politicians


   By SIMON HOLBERTON


   HONG KONG


CHINA yesterday hit out at Hong Kong's local politicians for supporting
proposals made by Mr Chris Patten, the colony's governor, for more democracy
 -but won little favour for itself in the process.
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing's unofficial embassy in Hong Kong, said the
Legislative Council (LegCo) had no right to approve a resolution which ran
counter to agreements and understandings reached between China and Britain.
LegCo was a 'consultative body' only, it said.
Xinhua further alleged that the vote in LegCo on Wednesday was carried out
under pressure from the Hong Kong government - a charge strenuously denied
by the government.
On Wednesday night, legislators voted 32 to 21 in favour of a motion
supporting Mr Patten's proposals for more democracy in elections due in
1995. They also called on Britain and China to resume talks.
But China won few friends in Hong Kong with its claims. Representatives of
groups that had voted for and against the motion criticised Beijing's
intervention.
Mr Ronald Arculli, a conservative politician who was in the minority,
defended LegCo's right to debate Mr Patten's proposals and express a view.
He pointed out that LegCo was a law-making institution and not a
consultative body to the government.
Mr Patten, who was in Vancouver yesterday, said he thought Hong Kong people
wanted a rational discussion rather than empty threats.
He said the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration and the 1990 Basic Law -
Beijing's constitution for the colony after it reverts to Chinese
sovereignty in 1997 - refer to the executive branch of government being
accountable to the legis-lature.
