FT  15 APR 94 / Observer: Bolshie Boris


The man from Ivantheterribleograd - Vladimir Zhirinovsky - is under fire
from Boris Fyodorov, Russia's pugnacious former finance minister. Fyodorov
is renaming his 26-member 'December 12' parliamentary faction the 'Liberal
Democratic Union' - not a million miles away from Vlad the impaler's
'Liberal Democratic party'.
'Somebody has to challenge him,' says Fyodorov, narked that Zhirinovsky's
party name connotes values somewhat removed from its neo-fascist ideology.
Boris hopes that by the 1996 elections, voters may choose the Liberal
Democratic Union - from confusion if not conviction.
Boris adds: 'I'd love Zhirinovsky to try to hit me,' recalling Vlad's
previous punch-ups, including one over his alleged queue-jumping in the
parliament's restaurant.
Zhirinovsky clearly espouses free market attitudes nowadays. In France
yesterday, having lost his cap at a meeting of the Council of Europe, he
advised the thief 'not to sell it straightaway, because the price of my hats
will increase enormously in the near future'.
