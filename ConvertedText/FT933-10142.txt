FT  05 AUG 93 / International Company News: Gencor unveils unbundling
details

GENCOR, South Africa's second-largest mining house, yesterday unveiled
details of its proposed unbundling which will leave it larger than
originally anticipated.
It will also have a residual 20 per cent holding in the consumer industrial
group Malbak, which is being spun off.
When Gencor made its initial announcement in May, it said it would be
unbundling all its non-mining assets, after which its net asset value could
be as low as R10bn. Yesterday's announcement said net assets would be
R14.1bn (Dollars 4.2bn).
Mr Brian Gilbertson, executive chairman, stressed that the central aim - to
leave the unbundled Gencor with the critical mass necessary to be a
successful international resource company - had been achieved. He also noted
that Malbak would in future be a portfolio investment, not a managed one as
in the past. He would step down from the Malbak board.
The unbundled Gencor's larger size came primarily from an appreciation in
its mining assets, especially gold and platinum, since the earlier
announcement. Gencor had also, as previously announced, collected about
R1.6bn in cash and portfolio investments since then.
Mr Gilbertson said about 30 per cent of the new Gencor's net assets would be
in cash and other realisable investments. 'This is an exceptionally healthy
position for a mining group ahead of a possible upturn in metal markets.'
But there were no immediate spending plans.
Negotiations to buy most of Billiton, the Royal Dutch/Shell mining and
metals arm, were 'on course'. Prospects of this deal being consummated had
improved 'but it is by no means a certainty'.
