decline in sales


   By RICHARD WATERS


   NEW YORK


R. H. Macy, the New York-based retailer operating under Chapter 11 of the US
bankruptcy code, recorded a further recovery in earnings in its second
quarter as cost-cutting took effect.
While sales during the period ending January 29 slipped Dollars 40m from a
year before, to just under Dollars 2bn, Macy's lifted net income to Dollars
60.5m, from Dollars 8.9m. Selling and other overhead costs were Dollars 68m
lower than a year before.
Cashflow, though still well below levels seen in the late 1980s, also
continued to show a recovery. Earnings before interest, tax and depreciation
in the quarter were Dollars 227m, up from Dollars 141m.
