FT  23 NOV 92 / Fears grow over CIS security

   MOSCOW, VILNIUS


A TOP military official of the Commonwealth of Independent states has warned
that CIS states were 'less and less able' to ensure their own security.
He spoke as reports came in of a massacre of 800 refugees on the border of
Tajikistan with Afghanistan and of fresh fighting yesterday near
Tajikistan's capital, Dushanbe.
Fighting also intensified in the disputed enclave of Nagorno Karabakh.
Lt Gen Leonid Ivashov, secretary of the CIS Defence Ministry council, said
in Moscow yesterday that armed conflicts were spreading in many regions and
that none of the new states was capable of ensuring its own security because
the process of forming armed forces had been so slow.
The worst example is Tajikistan, where, according to the Russian news agency
NeGa, heavily armed groups attacked a refugee camp and killed some 800
people. There was no indication as to when the attack took place.
The camp appeared to be one for the thousands of refugees from the fighting
between supporters of Mr Rakhmon Nabiyevc, the former Communist leader and
supporters of the pro-Islamic government. Fighting swept into the republic's
capital, Dushanbe, last month. Order in the country has completely broken
down.
In Azerbaijan, the Defence Ministry yesterday claimed that Armenian
self-defence forces in the north of Nagorno-Karabakh attacked two strategic
villages. Armenians said 30 Azeri and eight Armenian soldiers were killed.
Lithuanian politician Algirdas Brazauskas began talks late last night on
forming a government after a final count of votes in the November 15
election left his Democratic Labour party holding a majority of 73 seats,
down from a preliminary count of 80 seats, Reuter adds from Vilnius.
