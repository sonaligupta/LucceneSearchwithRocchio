FT  11 APR 94 / Harsher crime penalties opposed


Harsher prison sentences would not cut crime, Ms Anne Mace, chair of the
Association of Chief Officers of Probation, said yesterday presenting the
association's annual report.
Consistent policies aimed at gaining positive behaviour changes had
apparently been replaced, 'by a populist sound-bite campaign, characterised
by the slogan 'prison works''.
She said that harsher penalties were largely irrelevant to crime levels, and
the US was a salutary reminder of the limited use of more prisons to tackle
rising crime.
