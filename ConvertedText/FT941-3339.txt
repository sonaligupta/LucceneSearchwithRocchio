FT  16 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Builders led by Wolseley


   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON


News that UK construction orders rose 16 per cent in the quarter ending on
January 31, plus stunningly good interim results from Wolseley, the UK's
leading builders merchant, saw the shares spearhead a general upsurge in the
building materials and merchants sector.
Wolseley's profits at Pounds 87m were around Pounds 17m higher than the most
optimistic forecasts in the market, while the 33 per cent rise in the
dividend compared with most expectations of an increase in the region of 10
per cent. BZW hoisted its current-year forecast for Wolseley from Pounds
153m to Pounds 187m and its 1995 estimate to Pounds 230m.
Mr Howard Seymour, building analyst at BZW, said Wolseley's 'phenomenally
good figures' confirmed the strong recovery coming through in the light end
of the building market.
Wolseley finished 73 higher at a record 975p. Since their elevation to FT-SE
100 status last June, Wolseley shares have climbed 46 per cent, compared
with a 12.3 per cent advance by the 100 index.
Wolseley's excellent results were followed by news of a near four-fold
profits increase from Heywood Williams, the building products group.
Marley is also expected to report bumper profits with its figures this
morning. A big line of Marley stock was taken out of the market last week,
prompting speculation that the figures would be much better than the market
expects. Most predictions for Marley point to pre-tax profits of Pounds
34m-plus.
Builders merchant Travis Perkins is expected to reveal more than doubled
pre-tax profits of some Pounds 20m tomorrow.
Marley rose 4 to 204p, Heywood Williams 7 to 437p, Graham Group, floated at
183p only a week ago, 8 to 214p, Meyer International 29 to 545p and Travis
Perkins 13 to 359p.
At the heavy end of the building materials sector, hopes of an early
reduction in German interest rates boosted Redland, up 9 at 571p, and RMC,
13 ahead at 972p.
Housebuilders, on the other hand, were unsettled by what was said to have
been a flat and uninspiring post-results meeting between George Wimpey and
construction sector analysts.
'We were expecting a bullish statement on housebuilding but got a rather
dismal appraisal,' said one analyst. Current-year profits estimates of up to
Pounds 50m were said to have been trimmed back to Pounds 45m and less in
some cases. Wimpey shares dropped to a low for the session of 206p following
the analysts meeting, before steadying to close a net 8 off at 210p.
