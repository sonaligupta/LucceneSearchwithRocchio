FT  01 NOV 93 / Peru reform wins backing


   By SALLY BOWEN


   LIMA


PERUVIANS yesterday gave their approval to a new constitution but by a
smaller margin than the government had expected, according to projections by
Apoyo, the Lima-based polling organisation, as voting closed.
The projections indicated that 55.3 per cent had voted in favour of the
changes in the referendum - the first in the country's history - and 44.7
per cent against.
If confirmed, the result would open the way for President Alberto Fujimori
to seek re-election in 1995 as the new constitution provides for a serving
president to stand for an immediate second term.
The most enthusiastic support for the new constitution came in the capital,
Lima, which has around a third of the total population; many remote
provinces rejected it roundly. Official results are not due for several
days. The constitution would be the twelfth in Peru's republican history.
'Today marks the start of a new future for Peru, a future of modernity and
stability,' President Fujimori said as he cast his own vote. He called the
new constitution 'an enormously important political reform' and 'proof that
Peru is a real democracy'. Investment and jobs would swiftly follow, he
said.
The reforms define Peru as a social market economy. The new charter broadly
enshrines the liberal economic reforms decreed by Mr Fujimori's
administration, reducing the role of the state, outlawing monopolies and
introducing modern work practices.
