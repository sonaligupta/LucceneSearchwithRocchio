FT  20 JUL 94 / Observer: Cracked record


Opera-loving Sir Desmond Pitcher can be excused mixed feelings about the
three tenors' concert in Los Angeles last Saturday. It was their similar
performance before the 1990 World Cup final in Rome that gave him the idea
for an opera concert in Liverpool two years ago.
'I want something like the three tenors,' Brendan Carroll, his local PR
consultant, claims Sir Desmond told him, as they discussed maximising the
impact of the finish of the Grand Regatta Columbus tall ships race in
Liverpool.
Sir Desmond is chairman of Merseyside Development Corporation, the
government agency for regenerating the Liverpool and Birkenhead waterfronts.
It was responsible for the tall ships, though the inexperienced Carroll
ended up running the concert.
Unfortunately, the Pounds 2 company Carroll set up legally to distance the
concert from the MDC went bust after network TV coverage failed to
materialise - leaving the MDC and other creditors with nearly Pounds 700,000
of losses.
A report on the affair by the Commons' Public Accounts Committee is awaited,
but Sir Desmond got his retaliation in first yesterday with the
corporation's annual report to parliament, suggesting the MDC is doing
marvellously under his leadership.
Is it enough to save his part-time job with the corporation? Should he care
 -after all, he does quite nicely from his Pounds 338,000-a-year
chairmanship of North West Water, plus non-executive directorial commitments
to Everton and NatWest Bank.
