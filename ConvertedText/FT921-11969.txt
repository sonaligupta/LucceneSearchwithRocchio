FT  29 JAN 92 / Hanson keeps City guessing on his successor


Lord Hanson (left) yesterday ruled out a bid for Imperial Chemical
Industries eight months after taking a 2.8 per cent stake in the company. He
said Lord White (right), would not join the Hanson board because he was
chairman of Hanson's US arm which would not be best served by being directed
from Britain. Lord Hanson told the acquisitive conglomerate's shareholders
that his successor had been chosen but refused to name names. More than
1,000 shareholders attended the annual meeting in the Barbican Centre in
London. Most questions had to be submitted in writing before the meeting,
enabling Lord Hanson to read the answers from an autocue.
