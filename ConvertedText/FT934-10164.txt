FT  06 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Property trust launch


   By PHILIP COGGAN


THOSE WHO believe the property market is set for a revival may be attracted
by the flotation of the Wigmore Property investment trust. The trust will
invest in small and medium-sized property companies with market
capitalisations of less than Pounds 250m.
There are only three existing property investment trusts, of which the
largest is TR Property. Its shares have performed well over the last year as
falling interest rates improved investors' attitudes towards the property
sector.
Wigmore hopes to issue up to 50m shares at 100p each, with warrants attached
on a one-for-five basis. Over 19.3m shares are being placed with
institutions and property companies and the rest is on offer to the public.
Baring Investment Management is investment manager of the trust and the
property adviser is Baring, Houston & Sanders. The 10 largest investments in
the initial portfolio are expected to be: City Site Estates, Chesterfield
Properties, Ex-Lands, Hemingway Properties, London & Associated IT, Olives
Property, Prior, Southend Property Holdings, Tops Estates and Town Centre
Securities.
