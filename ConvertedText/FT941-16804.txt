FT  07 JAN 94 / International Company News: Delta launches legal challenge
over routes


   By RICHARD TOMKINS


Delta Air Lines, the US carrier, yesterday launched a court challenge to the
US government's rejection of its application for one of two new routes
between the US and London.
The US department of transportation last month decided to award both routes
to American Airlines for services from Nashville, Tennessee, and
Raleigh/Durham, North Carolina.
The routes became available because of a requirement that US Air should give
up its London routes after British Airways, the UK flag carrier, took a
stake in the company.
Delta contested the department's decision, in a petition filed with the
District of Columbia appeal court, on the grounds that American Airlines has
the most routes to the UK. It says the decision runs counter to the
department's policy of promoting geographical balance and diversity of
services, promoting new non-stop services in under-served areas, and
promoting greater competition.
Delta wants to introduce a route between London and Salt Lake City, Utah. It
says this would be convenient to more passengers, provide London services to
more US cities, and generate more US-London passengers than Nashville or
Raleigh/Durham.
Mr Ron Allen, Delta's chairman and chief executive, said the evidence
favouring Salt Lake City was clear and compelling.
Northwest Airlines, the US carrier in which KLM Royal Dutch Airlines owns a
49 per cent stake, is expected to file its plans for an initial public
offering with the US Securities and Exchange Commission next week.
