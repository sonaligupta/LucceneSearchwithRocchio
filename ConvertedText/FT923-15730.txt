FT  01 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Clash on boundary body role


   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent


LABOUR'S acceptance of the impartiality of the parliamentary boundary
commissions was reaffirmed by Mr Alistair Darling, opposition home affairs
spokesman, last night.
His assurance was seized on by government supporters as a repudiation of a
'corruption' charge levelled against the English commission last week by Mr
Ken Livingstone, the Labour MP for Brent East.
Moving the third reading of the Boundary Commissions Bill, Mr Kenneth
Clarke, home secretary, confirmed that the parliamentary commission for
England could propose changes to London constituencies that involved
crossing local-government boundaries.
He said the existing rules allowed the commission to make such
recommendations where it was judged necessary to reduce disparities in the
size of constituencies.
About 20 Labour MPs ignored Mr Darling's call not to vote against the third
reading, which was carried by a government majority of 166 (221-55).
The government has delayed publication of a bill on employment legislation,
originally intended for introduction this week, until after the
parliamentary recess. The bill would require unions to obtain members'
consent every three years before asking employers to deduct subscriptions
from salaries.
