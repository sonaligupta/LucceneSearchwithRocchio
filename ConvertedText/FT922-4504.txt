FT  05 JUN 92 / Observer: Counterblast


The Silent Service found its tongue with a vengeance yesterday, waxing
indignant about accounts of how its submarine HMS Opportune got dented in a
fog-shrouded collision with a Panamanian-flagged merchant vessel.
Opportune did nothing inopportune, the Royal Navy roared. She was barely
moving when struck by the merchantman Radnes, whose captain and crew are
being questioned by a department of transport inspector.
According to the RN, the submarine was sailing cautiously on the surface
when its radar showed the other ship approaching through the fog at about 15
knots. Opportune took evasive action and was virtually stationary with
engines full astern at the moment of collision.
'An exchange of views took place by radio,' a spokesman added.
