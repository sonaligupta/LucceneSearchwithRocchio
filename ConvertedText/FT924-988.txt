FT  21 DEC 92 / Hidden perils of an office romance


   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff


OFFICE PARTY romances can carry a greater risk than mere hangovers,
according to the Labour Research Depart-ment.
An analysis of industrial tribunal cases in the department's magazine shows
that sexual relationships that affect people's jobs are fraught with
pitfalls.
Employers can dismiss employees for their personal conduct if it:
Disrupts other workplace relationships or activ-ities.
Threatens to harm the business.
Affects job performance or employees' work ability.
Employees cannot always avoid difficulties by getting married. Some
workplaces have rules saying that married couples should not work in the
same office.
A council housing officer, for example, who refused to move when he married
somebody from the same office, was dismissed. An industrial tribunal upheld
the sacking, saying the man had not been dismissed because he had married.
If his wife had not been a housing officer he would not have lost his job.
In general, difficulties that affect married couples working together are
more likely to surface when one partner left for another job, Labour
Research says. Employers may, for instance, fear leaks of information.
In one case, a marketing assistant was told that, although her salary would
be maintained, she would be moved to a much lower-graded post after her
husband left to work for a rival company. She refused and was dismissed. A
tribunal said the company had acted reasonably in dismissing her.
