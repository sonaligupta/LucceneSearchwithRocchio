FT  27 SEP 94 / Arts: Today's Television


   By ANTONY THORNCROFT


Social issues abound on the screens this evening. The award winning Canadian
mini-series Look who's talking: the Boys of St Vincent (Channel 4 at 10pm)
is based on an actual case in which a Catholic priest abused the children in
his orphanage. Many of the parts are taken by non-professional actors.
Look Who's Talking: My Dad is Mrs Bottomley (Channel 4 at 9pm) examines the
lives and aspirations of three teenagers stuck in a children's home in south
east England.
There is no shortage of TV dramas set in hospitals, but writer Donna
Franceschild has pushed the genre one step on by placing Takin' over the
Asylum in a psychiatric hospital. Ken Stott leads as the hospital DJ who
tries to bring back radio to a hospital where life revolves around the
television set. Former patients are included in the cast of this six part
series (BBC 2 9pm).
Network First (ITV at 10.40) offers a documentary about Cuba which includes
a lengthy interview with Fidel Castro.
For light relief there is the TV version of Paul Merton's Palladium show of
earlier this year (BBC 1 at 10.20).
