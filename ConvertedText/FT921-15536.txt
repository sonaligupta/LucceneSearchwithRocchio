FT  09 JAN 92 / Observer: White knight


Blind people everywhere should be in mourning today, following the news of
the death of Jean Delage in Rabat, Morocco, at the age of 99. The French
author and journalist made a white cane the internationally recognised
symbol of blindness.
He established the 'Cannes Blanches' association for the blind in France
after the First World War, using the white stick as a mark of recognition.
Delage began as a cabaret singer in Paris, writing several plays which were
successfully staged in Paris and Brussels. He then went on to journalism and
wrote two books about Russian exiles in Paris.
