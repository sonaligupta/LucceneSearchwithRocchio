FT  01 NOV 93 / German far-right launches Euro-campaign


   By DAVID WALLER


   RASTATT


POLICE armed with machine guns stopped and searched cars as they approached
the outskirts of Rastatt in south-west Germany yesterday. Helicopters buzzed
overhead and hundreds of green-clad riot-police milled about the streets.
The reason was the gathering of the Republicans, one of Germany's most
prominent far-right parties and a disconcerting threat to the country's
political establishment in next year's 'election marathon', when there will
be no fewer than 19 elections in Germany.
Mr Franz Schonhuber, the former Waffen SS sergeant who heads the party, to
applause from 500-plus delegates declared the campaign for the election to
the European parliament under way.
His message, well-tempered to the ears of the shopkeepers, small-businessmen
and retired policemen and soldiers who swell the party's ranks, was that the
Maastricht treaty on European integration was a 'Versailles without war', an
agreement which had sold Germany's interests down the river as effectively
as the Treaty of Versailles which followed the First World War.
The German Volk had been denied the opportunity to vote directly on the
issue, betrayed by Bonn's traditional parties in the same way that Germany's
interest were betrayed by those in the political elite who put their seal to
the Treaty of Versailles. The Republicans would be the only party to be
campaigning in next year's European elections on a clear anti-Maastricht
ticket.
Support for the Republicans in the electorate appears to have slowed down,
as they have been tarred with the brush of skinhead violence against
foreigners. But they only just failed to gain 5 per cent of the vote in
recent elections in Hamburg.
