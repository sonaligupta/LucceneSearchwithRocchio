FT  13 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Lilliput flotation at 135p


   By DAVID BLACKWELL


LILLIPUT GROUP, the Cumbria-based manufacturer of hand-painted miniature
china cottages, yesterday finalised its flotation, pricing its ordinary
shares at 135p.
This gives a p/e of 14.5 and a market capitalisation of Pounds 31.4m. The
company is forecasting operating profits of not less than Pounds 3m for the
year ending January 2, and earnings per share of at least 9.3p.
The directors will recommend a final dividend of not less than 0.6p,
equivalent to 4.35p if the shares had been trading a full year. This gives a
notional gross yield of 4 per cent and is 2.1 times covered.
Last year operating profit was Pounds 2.13m on turnover of Pounds 13.6m. For
the six months to July 4 operating profits were Pounds 1.08m on turnover of
Pounds 7.1m.
The company is placing a total of 12.04m ordinary shares with institutional
and other investors, with 4.2m of them subject to a clawback to meet retail
demand through intermediaries.
The flotation will raise Pounds 16.25m for the existing shareholders and
Pounds 2.43m net of expenses for the company, of which Pounds 1.47m will be
used to redeem preference and deferred shares.
After the flotation the existing shareholders will continue to hold 48.3 per
cent of the shares. Of this, the executive directors, their families and
related trusts will have 22.7 per cent. Mr David Tate, the technical
director and founder of the company, will retain 3.83m shares or 16.5 per
cent of the issued capital.
Strong demand is stimulated by the 65,000-strong collectors' club. Cottages
bought for Pounds 10 10 years ago have been known to change hands for Pounds
1,600.
COMMENT
The hand-painted china country cottage industry supplies a niche market if
ever there was one. David Tate's commitment to quality and technical
innovation is in no doubt, and the company is a past master at creating
demand for the expensive, collectable end of its range. However, it is
difficult to believe that competitors will not emerge to exploit what
appears to be a lucrative market. Fashion could also be a factor in the gift
shops, where Lilliput models have to fight for shelf-space with companies
such as Royal Doulton. A p/e of 14.5 looks optimistic, and very little of
the money raised is going back to the company. A limited edition model
cottage might prove a better investment than the shares.
