FT  20 APR 94 / Observer: Patten of dissent


Not even John Patten's alma mater likes his ideas very much. As education
secretary, Patten has spearheaded the government's policy of persuading
Britain's state schools to opt out of local authority control. But parents
at Patten's old school - Wimbledon College, a Catholic boys' school in
London - have voted against parting company with the Labour-
controlled borough of Merton. Last year John Major was similarly embarrassed
when his old school, Rutlish, also voted against opting-out.
Patten was flogged by the Jesuits who run Wimbledon College for his poor
performance in mathematics. Inhuman or degrading corporal punishment is now
illegal under the 1993 Education Act; fortunately there is as yet no ban on
public humiliation of former pupils.
