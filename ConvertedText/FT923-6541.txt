FT  24 AUG 92 / Freight companies expect sharp increase in business


   By Financial Times Reporter


UK FREIGHT and distribution companies expect a sharp increase in business -
particularly export business - in the coming year, according to a survey by
European Freight Management, a Financial Times newsletter.
Sixty two per cent of the organisations questioned said they expected export
and domestic business to increase. Only 52 per cent said they expected
import business to make gains. This would be an improvement on the past 12
months, when 48 per cent of the companies questioned saw an increase in both
export and domestic business and only 30 per cent reported more import
trade.
The survey shows a marked difference in the outlook of large freight and
distribution companies - those with more than 1,000 employees and which
carry out most of the business. They pre-dicted continuing depressed
domestic and import conditions. Only 45 per cent of these large
organisations expected an increase in this type of trade in the next 12
months. But 73 per cent of the large organisations suggested their export
business would increase.
Only 36 per cent of the large companies reported an increase in import
business in the past 12 months. Domestic business increased for 55 per cent
and export business for 73 per cent.
