FT  07 JAN 94 / Observer: New chapter


Sounds like Rupert Pennant-Rea - the lanky colonial boy who used to edit The
Economist - is starting to shake things up in his new job as deputy governor
of the Bank of England.
Not only has he established that the Bank's quarterly inflation report can
be prepared without Treasury interference - he is making an even more
earth-shattering change to the Bank's quarterly bulletin. In a bid to turn
its turgid and technical prose into a showcase for Bank research,
contributors are being promised bylines in next month's edition.
Hacks at The Economist who have laboured on unsigned articles since 1843 may
be less than thrilled that Pennant-Rea's new editorial staff have been
granted recognition so soon.
