FT  26 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Ministers suffer leasehold defeat


   By ALISON SMITH


FLAT OWNERS in cathedral closes are to be excluded from the government's
controversial plans for leasehold reform, after ministers were defeated in
the House of Lords yesterday.
In their final debate on the housing and urban development bill, peers voted
by 123 to 107 to support a move by the Earl of Kinnoull, a Tory backbencher,
to exclude holders of long leases on properties within a cathedral precinct
from benefiting from the reforms which increase tenants' rights.
Just two weeks ago the government suffered a similar rebellion when its own
peers managed to exclude some 60 stately homes from the plans enabling
leaseholders to buy the freehold of their prop-erties.
Though neither revolt is significant in terms of the overall thrust of the
reform, each highlights the consistent and heartfelt opposition to the
proposals within Conservative ranks. The Duke of Westminster left the Tory
party over the issue.
Although attacks on the reforms have come both from those supporting
landlords' interests and those campaigning for a further extension of
tenants' rights, the two sides have often cancelled each other out, enabling
the government to avoid further set-backs.
The Lords provided a vivid example of this yesterday in a rare tied vote
over an attempt to increase the number of leaseholders who would be eligible
for the reforms. Under Lords procedures, the deadlock means that the
proposal, which attracted 131 votes for and against, is lost.
in spite of the bill's troubled passage through parliament, the only
remaining stage is for the Commons to discuss the changes made by the Lords.
