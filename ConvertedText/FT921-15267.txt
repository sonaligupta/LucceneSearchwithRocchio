FT  11 JAN 92 / Letter: 'Mischievous' to suggest headhunter conflict


   From Mr WILLIAM L GILL


Sir, Your article, 'Money spent on headhunters is 'wasted'' (January 7),
seems to be special pleading on behalf of the occupational psychologists. It
also denigrates the work done by the many reputable executive search
consultancies which provide a service that is much valued, I can assure you,
by their clients.
Headhunters normally operate at the most senior levels where it is essential
that track record is firmly established. This can be best done by interviews
and market research conducted by experienced interviewers - which is the
technical and judgmental skill which headhunters provide. I think that
nearly all the very senior top managers would resent an occupational
psychological test. They are head-hunted on the basis of their reputations
and their indisputable records.
Of course, as you go lower down the scale, psychological testing has its
place and this is why all headhunters do use psychological tests for those
whose records are less clearly established. You acknowledge that 40 per cent
of head-hunters employ psychological tests.
Surely a more balanced approach is to say that there are proper places for
both the interview and market research techniques employed by skilled
headhunters, as well as the support facility provided by professional
occupational psychologists. This would certainly be our view.
I think it is mischievous of you to suggest that there is a conflict between
the two techniques. They are mutually supporting.
