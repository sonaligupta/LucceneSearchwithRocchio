FT  21 APR 94 / Recovery drive reduces rate cut hopes: Earnings growth and
rising employment awaken fears of inflationary pressures


   By PHILIP COGGAN, RICHARD DONKIN and PHILIP STEPHENS


Further evidence of a buoyant UK recovery yesterday reduced hopes of an
early interest rate cut.
Financial markets were upset by an increase in the underlying rate of annual
growth in average earnings to 3.5 per cent in the 12 months to January,
compared with an earlier estimate by the Department of Employment of 3.25
per cent. In February, the annual rate figure remained unchanged at 3.5 per
cent. The figures were seen as a signal of inflationary pressures.
A fall in unemployment and an upbeat survey from the British Chambers of
Commerce represented further evidence of economic recovery.
Traders assumed that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, would be less likely
to sanction a reduction in base rates from 5.25 per cent.
The FT-SE 100 Index dropped 29.7 points to 3,098.3 on the day while the June
long gilt future fell by more than a point.
Mr Clarke, moved swiftly to damp suggestions at Westminster that the
evidence of recovery - and also lower-than-expected public borrowing - could
prompt a relaxation of the government's fiscal stance.
He said the tax increases and public spending curbs announced in last
November's budget would remain in place, and dismissed suggestions that the
government might relax spending and borrowing constraints.
The number of people out of work and claiming benefits fell by 30,300 in
March to 2,722,600 on a seasonally adjusted basis.
At 9.7 per cent of the workforce, unemployment is at its lowest level since
June 1992. On an unadjusted basis, the fall was 63,868 to 2,777,545. Most of
the jobs being created were either part-time or in self-employment.
Between March and December 1993, the number of part-time workers rose by
162,000, while those in full-time work fell by 124,000. The Department of
Employment also published figures showing that, at the end of 1993, 326,000
more people were in work than had previously been estimated.
A change in the method of compiling the statistics, to reflect the growth of
the service sector and of small companies was responsible for the revision.
Good news on employment also came from the Chambers of Commerce survey which
showed service and manufacturing companies plan to take on more staff over
the next three months. The survey showed that employers' optimism about jobs
and investment intentions is the highest since the recession began.
However, Mr John Prescott, the shadow employment spokesman, accused the
government of grossly understating the real level of unemployment which he
claimed was running at 5m.
This figure takes in an additional 2.2m people who say they would like to
work but are not actively looking for work. At the rate that unemployment
was falling, he said, 'it would still take the best part of eight years to
get to the level of unemployment the Tories inherited in 1979'.
Meanwhile, figures showed the public sector borrowing requirement for
1993-94 was lower than had been forecast at the time of the Budget,
provoking calls for the recent round of tax increases to be reversed.
The Central Statistical Office said the PSBR for 1993-94 was Pounds 45.9bn,
compared with the earlier government forecast of Pounds 49.8bn. But the
Treasury said the improvement was due to one-off factors, such as greater
than expected debt repayments by local authorities.
