   NEW YORK


AMERICAN Express, the US travel and financial services group that has been
buffeted by management upheavals and losses in its credit card business,
yesterday disclosed Dollars 243m, or 48 cents per share, of net income for
the first quarter of 1993, down from Dollars 274m in the same quarter of
1992.
The Shearson Lehman Brothers subsidiary, part of which is being sold to Mr
Sandy Weill's Primerica financial services group, suffered a net loss of
Dollars 451m in the quarter, compared with a Dollars 71m profit a year ago.
Revenues were 14.4 per cent higher at Dollars 2.27bn.
The Lehman Brothers investment banking portion of SLB - which will remain
part of American Express for the time being - had net income of Dollars
54.5m in the quarter, up from Dollars 26.9m a year ago.
American Express said net profit was struck after taking a Dollars 630m
write-off on its pending sale of the Shearson Lehman Brothers retail and
asset management businesses plus a reserve provision of Dollars 100m related
to non-core businesses and gains on asset disposals. These gains included
Dollars 165m on the sale of the Boston Company and Dollars 433m on reduction
of ownership of the First Data Corporation subsidiary.
The core travel related services division had 68 per cent better
first-quarter net income of Dollars 211m. TRS revenues declined by 5.6 per
cent in the quarter to Dollars 2.34bn, largely due to discount rate
reductions, the sale of certain insurance lines and a decline in
international volumes.
The IDS financial services division had Dollars 74m of net income, up by 21
per cent. Revenues were 7.5 per cent higher at Dollars 742m.
The American Express Bank had Dollars 15m of first-quarter net income, down
from Dollars 17.7m a year ago. Revenues declined by 11.3 per cent to Dollars
294.8m.
American Express said its net income before gains on asset sales and
accounting changes was Dollars 375m, up from Dollars 249m a year ago.
On Wall Street, American Express shares was down Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 28
1/8.
