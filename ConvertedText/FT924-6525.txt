FT  20 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Plea for single European
credit rating agency


   By RICHARD WATERS


A MERGER of existing credit rating companies in Europe would be the best way
of creating an agency which spanned the continent, the man heading the
German credit rating initiative suggested yesterday.
Mr Oliver Everling, managing director of Projektgesellschaft Rating, which
has carried out preparatory work for an agency, said a merger of British and
French organisations last month was the first step towards such an body.
At a congress in Amsterdam, Mr Everling said Europe has about 40 separate
rating agencies. The merger of the London-based IBCA and French Euronotation
paved the way for other European agencies to join a pan-European body.
Surveys in the Netherlands and Germany show that European companies wanted a
new institute based on the continent, he said. 'The investor needs full
market coverage to make comparisons between ratings. There is a big
discrepancy between market potential and market coverage.'
Mr Everling said a major factor in setting up the European agency was that
no other valued opinion was available to Standard & Poor's and Moody's,
'even when they are wrong'.
