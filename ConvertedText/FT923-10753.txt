FT  29 JUL 92 / Letter: Dismissal was unlawful


   From Mr RONNIE FOX


Sir, The damages awarded against Nissan UK in court proceedings last week
were not for unfair dismissal ('Ex-executive wins Pounds 804,860 for unfair
dismissal', July 25) but for unlawful dismissal; that is, for breach of Mr
Stan Cholaj's contract of employment.
The distinction is important. Usually, the highest award which an industrial
tribunal has jurisdiction to make following an unfair dismissal - that is,
dismissal contrary to the employment legislation - is only Pounds 16,150.
The amount awarded to Mr Cholaj is said to be the largest in an employment
action. Employees who have not gone to court have often received much larger
sums as part of an amicable settlement. The terms of the settlement
invariably include an undertaking to keep the details confidential.
