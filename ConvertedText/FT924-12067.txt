FT  22 OCT 92 / International Company News: United Technologies lifts
earnings 19%


   By MARTIN DICKSON


   NEW YORK


UNITED Technologies, the US aerospace-to-elevators group in the throes of a
cost-cutting programme, yesterday reported a 19 per cent increase in
third-quarter earnings as improved profits in several divisions offset the
depressed state of its Pratt & Whitney aero engine business.
UTC reported net income of Dollars 142m, compared with Dollars 119m in the
same period of last year. However, after changes in the tax treatment of
dividends on the company's preferred stock, this translated into earnings
per share of 89 cents, up from 85 cents. Revenues totalled Dollars 5.4bn, up
from Dollars 5.3bn.
Mr Robert Daniell, chairman, said: 'All business segments showed improved
earnings except power (Pratt & Whitney), which continues to be severely
affected by the depressed state of the global airlines and by defence cuts.'
Pratt announced last week it was speeding up and expanding its workforce
cuts, losing 7,500 jobs by next June, against an original plan for a 2,400
reduction by that date, because of much lower demand for new engines.
Pratt reported a third-quarter operating profit of Dollars 32m, down from
Dollars 127m, on revenues of Dollars 1.5bn, compared with Dollars 1.7bn,
primarily due to lower earnings on commercial spare parts and new engines.
The commercial spares order rate in the quarter was 28 per cent lower than
in the first half of the year.
The company's flight systems business, which includes Sikorsky, the
helicopter manufacturer, reported profits of Dollars 111m, up from Dollars
41m on revenues unchanged at Dollars 1bn.
The company said this was due to a continuing strong performance at Sikorsky
and Hamilton Standard, and reduced losses at its Norden radar business.
Building systems, which includes Otis, the elevator company, and Carrier,
the air conditioning manufacturer, saw profits rise from Dollars 122m to
Dollars 148m on revenues up from Dollars 2.1bn to Dollars 2.3bn, because of
cost-cutting and Carrier's market share gains in the US.
Automotive products produced profits of Dollars 36m, up from Dollars 18m,
thanks mainly to gains on disposals. For the nine months, net income rose to
Dollars 417m, or Dollars 2.84, up from Dollars 203m, or Dollars 1.42, on
revenues up to Dollars 16.3bn from Dollars 15.5bn.
