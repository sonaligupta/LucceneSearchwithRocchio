FT  30 JAN 92 / BP to shed 400 jobs at chemicals plant


BRITISH PETROLEUM is to shed 400 jobs at its Saltend chemicals plant near
Hull, Humberside. The losses will be divided between production and office
workers. The workforce now numbers 1,700.
Mr Alan Boden, Saltend general manager, said: 'While I regret the need for
the loss of so many jobs, it is essential that we change the way we are
carrying out our business if we are to survive against international
competition.'
He added that BP hoped the job cuts could be achieved on a voluntary basis,
but compulsory redundancies had not been ruled out.
