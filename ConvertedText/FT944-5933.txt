FT  01 DEC 94 / Arts: Today's Television


   By MARTIN HOYLE


I've taken Forbidden Britain to task for its implicitly patronising
assumption that we suppose the evils it charts (unhappy marriages, adultery,
riots) to be purely modern phenomena, as if nobody in the television age
read books (or even had a memory).
Last week's film on homelessness recalled the vivid passage in A Clergyman's
Daughter where Orwell described dossing down in Trafalgar Square - in 1935.
But tonight's film on child sex abuse (9.45pm, BBC2) really does shake
complacency.
To the question of whether the media are currently exaggerating the problem
or whether it always existed, swept under the carpet, the programme gives a
disturbing answer. An octogenarian's carefully articulate account of her
sufferings at the hands of a foster-brother is movingly dignified.
She presumably, like the other speakers, represents a sort of happy ending
in her eventual ability to face the past and adjust to life. She speaks
touchingly of the good and loving man she married. But how many other lives
were ruined?
