FT  11 MAR 94 / International Company News: Weak krona helps Aga advance 6%
for year

   STOCKHOLM


Aga, the Swedish industrial gas group, yesterday reported a 6 per cent
increase in profits after financial items to SKr1.56bn (Dollars 195m) for
1993, chiefly due to the weakness of the Swedish krona and the consolidation
of newly-acquired cold storage companies in France and Germany.
The company said it expected a further improvement in 1994 as the economies
in key markets improved and the benefits of rationalisation fed through. It
is raising the dividend to SKr10 per share from SKr9 per share last year and
proposes a five-for-one share split.
Consolidation of the French company CEGF and German Bremerhavener
Kuhlhauser, both acquired at the end of 1992, and the sharp fall in the
value of the Swedish krona last year helped push up group sales by 35 per
cent to SKr16.06bn from SKr11.87bn in 1992.
Operating profits were also up 28 per cent at SKr1.65bn, compared with
SKr1.29bn in 1992. Aga said most gas operations improved operating margins.
Frigoscandia, the cold storage and food processing business, reported
operating profits up dramatically at SKr275m from SKr145m thanks to the new
acquisitions.
Net financial expenses, excluding dividends and positive exchange rate
adjustments, leapt to SKr327m from just SKr3m in 1992. Net borrowings
increased to SKr4.4bn from SKr3.3bn.
