FT  30 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: BES rush goes on


   By BETHAN HUTTON


NEW business expansion schemes are still flooding in ahead of the December
deadline, writes Bethan Hutton. Assured tenancy and arranged exit schemes
continue to be popular with investors, but a number of trading companies are
also taking their last chance to use the BES tax incentive to attract new
money.
Cadogan, the publisher of travel and chess guides, is aiming to raise Pounds
750,000 through a BES offer. The company has 35 travel titles, and its chess
authors include Garry Kasparov (who is also a director). Minimum investment
is Pounds 1,050, or Pounds 525 for booksellers and newsagents.
The Hop Back Brewery is a profitable brewing and pub company, based in
Salisbury. It aims to raise Pounds 750,000 to expand through an
entrepreneurial BES issue, sponsored by Wise Speke. Minimum investment is
Pounds 500.
Coventry-based Patrick Eggle Guitars produces 225 electric and acoustic
instruments a month and is hoping to raise almost Pounds 500,000 to expand.
Minimum subscription is Pounds 2,000.
New Netherhall Residences is the Netherhall Educational Association's second
arranged exit scheme, guaranteed by the Midland Bank and sponsored by James
Capel. It offers an exit price of Pounds 1.19 after five years, equivalent
to an annual 13.84 per cent for higher-rate taxpayers. Minimum investment is
Pounds 1,000; cheques can be post-dated to November 19.
Investment in Heritage is an assured tenancy BES, sponsored by Matrix
Securities, which aims to raise Pounds 5m to buy, refurbish and let listed
properties of small to medium size. Minimum investment is Pounds 2,000.
There is no arranged exit, but the directors aim to provide a minimum return
of Pounds 1.40 a share after five years.
Accumulus Froebel is a cash-backed, arranged exit scheme sponsored by
Terrace Hill Capital. Froebel Educational Institute has several schools and
colleges around London. The scheme is offering a return of Pounds 1.20 a
share after five years, equivalent to 14.1 per cent for higher-rate
taxpayers. Minimum investment is Pounds 2,000.
