British & American Film Holdings, the investment company with small film
production and distribution activities, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds
675,000 for the six months to June 30, against Pounds 618,000.
The increase was achieved on turnover of Pounds 839,000 (Pounds 775,000).
The interim dividend goes up to 4.8p (4.275p), payable from earnings of
18.48p (14.29p).
Sir John Woolf, chairman, called on the Accounting Standards Board to review
the impact of the introduction of FRS 3 to counter 'the unfortunate effect
of introducing a significant element of unnecessary volatility to our
results'.
On a pre-FRS 3 basis, the pre-tax line amounted to Pounds 697,000 and
earnings to 19.24p.
