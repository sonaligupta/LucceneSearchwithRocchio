FT  15 APR 94 / IoD warns on cost of laws for disabled


   By ROLAND RUDD


The Institute of Directors yesterday warned that businesses could face
millions of pounds of new costs if new laws for the disabled come into
force, Roland Rudd writes.
Lord Young of Graffham, IoD president, has written to Mr Michael Heseltine,
trade and industry secretary, and Mr Peter Lilley, social security
secretary, warning that measures contained in a private member's bill from
Mr Roger Berry could swamp the government's deregulation bill.
Mr Berry, Labour MP for Kingswood, has received all-party support for his
bill. It would extend the type of legislation that makes it illegal to
discriminate on grounds of race or sex to the disabled.
