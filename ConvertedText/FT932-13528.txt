AUDI, a division of Germany's Volkswagen group, said negotiations to build
an engine plant in Hungary had been completed and a fully-owned subsidiary,
Audi Hungaria Motor, had been founded, Reuter reports from Munich.
An agreement between Audi and Hungary's ministry for industry and trade, the
finance ministry and the ministry for international relations has been
reached.
The plant will be established at Gyoer, between Bratislava and Budapest,
where Audi plans initially to build about 1,000 engine components daily
starting in mid-1994 and employing 200 people. Constructing the plant calls
for the investment of some DM300m (Dollars 186.3m).
