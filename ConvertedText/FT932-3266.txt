FT  15 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Understanding Mr Clarke


The rise of nearly 30 points in the FT-SE 100 index at one stage yesterday
suggests markets may be expecting too much of tonight's Mansion House
speech. Though the gain was basically driven by the futures market, it was
attributed to expectations that the new chancellor would kick off with a cut
in interest rates. That would be hard to justify.
The latest producer price figures show inflation remains subdued but it is
not exactly falling either. More significantly, Mr Clarke is hemmed in
politically, both by his predecessor's criticism of the way the last rate
cut decision was taken and by the opposition of the Bank of England.
Indeed, he may not be ready to launch any particular policy initiatives
after such a short period in office. But the policy debate has assumed a new
intensity since Mr Lamont's departure. Two strands are worth noting: first
the notion has surfaced that accelerating growth may be enough to sort out
the PSBR, and second there is a view in some quarters that a strong exchange
rate is a good way of curbing inflation. Such an approach to the PSBR may be
the easy political way out, but it would quickly reveal itself as flawed. If
a strong exchange rate were also part of the picture, talk might then turn
to how far interest rates would have to rise rather than when they would
come down.
