FT  16 MAR 94 / International Company News: Bayer result raises hopes for
German chemicals


   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES

Hopes of an end to the German chemicals industry's four-year profits slump
were raised yesterday by the release of better-than-expected earnings
figures from the Bayer group.
In line with the company's forecasts, the dividend was left unchanged at
DM11, and sales fell only 0.5 per cent to DM41bn (Dollars 16bn).
Although Mr Manfred Schneider, chairman, suggested in January that earnings
would be better than he had forecast, net income of DM1.37bn, down 12.2 per
cent, and pre-tax profits of DM2.35bn, down 12.6 per cent, were better than
many analysts expected.
Last year, when Bayer reported pre-tax profits and sales down 19 per cent
and 2 per cent respectively in the first three-quarters of 1993, management
said it expected a fall of 20 per cent in gross earnings for the full year.
The group, which had predicted flat profits in 1994, is likely to offer a
clearer view of earnings prospects at its annual press conference on Friday.
Bayer has traditionally fared better in recession than its main domestic
rivals, Hoechst and BASF - both of which announced a DM2 cut in their 1993
dividends - because of its strength in healthcare and relative lack of
reliance on basic chemicals. The drugs businesses generate some two-thirds
of total profits.
True to form, healthcare sales were 5 per cent up at the nine-month mark,
despite reductions in domestic health services.
Yesterday's figures were released after a meeting of the supervisory board,
which also agreed to propose an end to voting restrictions, imposed in 1975,
at this year's annual meeting.
The limit, restricting shareholders' voting rights to 5 per cent regardless
of the size of their holdings, was raised at last year's meeting, when the
management hinted it was prepared to consider change.
