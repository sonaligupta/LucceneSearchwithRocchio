FT  06 AUG 93 / Observer: Paris the thought


Barclays Bank bosses, anxious to find some good news in yesterday's interim
figures, were crowing about a new computer system which monitors unusual
transactions. It prompts staff to ring up customers and ask them when they
last saw their card.
Sir Peter Middleton, the deputy chairman, was the first to sing the praises
of the Fraud 2000 system. Having transferred some money to his daughter in
Africa, and paid for a holiday, he got a worried call from Barclaycard. Not
to be outdone, Andrew Buxton, the bank's chairman, added his tale of a chum
whose card was used in Paris and whose family was called by the bank to
check.
'In fact, he was on a spending spree in Paris,' added Buxton. Much merriment
ensued until the the full implications dawned. Not every Barclaycard owner
would be thrilled to learn that an unusual transaction in Paris prompts a
check call to base. Sounds like the system could do with a bit more
fine-tuning.
