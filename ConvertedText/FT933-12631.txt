FT  23 JUL 93 / Holiday company failures due to growth


   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent


OVER-AMBITIOUS expansion resulted in the collapse last year of 24 providers
of flight-based package holidays - the highest number on record - say the
accounts of the Air Travel Trust Fund, published yesterday.
The Civil Aviation Authority, which administers the fund, said it had to
arrange the return to the UK of 30,416 holidaymakers whose companies had
failed in the year to March 31. The cost of repatriation was Pounds 5.6m.
More than half those repatriated were customers of Airbreak, which collapsed
last September.
The authority also had to arrange refunds to 127,910 customers of failed
companies, at a cost of Pounds 12.96m. Nearly half of those who received
refunds were customers of Riva, which failed last February. Riva was set up
by former executives of the International Leisure Group, which collapsed in
1991.
Of the Pounds 18.6m total spent on repatriation and refunds, just under
Pounds 6m was paid by the trust fund. The fund makes up the shortfall where
the failed company's bond proves insufficient.
The biggest call on the fund came from Sungate Travel, which collapsed last
March. Sungate's bond fell Pounds 1.7m short of what was needed to
compensate customers. Airbreak's failure resulted in the fund paying out
Pounds 1.3m, while the cost to it of the Riva failure was Pounds 1m.
The authority said the size of the call on the fund was increased because of
the unusually high proportion of failures during the July to September
period. Failures during the peak season are more costly because of the high
numbers of people already abroad who require repatriation and because many
who have not yet left have paid for their holidays in full.
Operators expanded their programmes last year, but demand failed to match
expectations.
