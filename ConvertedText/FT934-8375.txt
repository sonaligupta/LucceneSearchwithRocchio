FT  16 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Tax switch would undermine pensions


   From Mr RON AMY


Sir, For the past two years, since Pounds 400m disappeared from the Maxwell
pension funds, the pensions industry has not wavered in its pursuit of
restoring confidence, stability and security.
We were dismayed by the Pounds l0bn of actuarial asset value which was
stripped from pension funds in the last budget and which is now costing
British companies and pensioners Pounds 500m a year. And now, John Maples
(Personal View, November 12) suggests that the government go further and
takes Pounds 100bn from Britain's pension funds - the equivalent of 250
Maxwell scandals.
He says the government should tax pension contributions instead of payments.
But could we trust future governments to resist the temptation to
reintroduce tax on pensions payments - ultimately bringing a higher tax
yield? Like the Maxwell pensioners, millions of people would have no
guarantee that their pension would not be hit when they retired.
Mr Maples suggests that there would be no public outcry. Even if the
government did not go anywhere near as far as he recommends, there is clear
evidence that there would be an angry reaction from pensioners and pension
scheme members - as there was with Maxwell.
Taxing pension fund contributions, rather than pensions, is an idea which
has, in the past, been rejected out of hand. With more need for private
provision as state pensions decline in real terms, the government should not
be undermining the efforts that individuals are making in order to provide
for their retirement by seeking to raise further revenue from pension funds.
