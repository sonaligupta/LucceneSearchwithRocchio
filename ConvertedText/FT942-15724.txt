FT  14 APR 94 / Buddhist group to be probed


   By JOHN BURTON


The South Korean government has agreed to a parliamentary investigation of
allegations that the Chogye order, the country's main Buddhist group, was
involved in illegal financing of President Kim Young-sam's 1992 election
campaign.
At the same time the administrative head of the Chogye order resigned
yesterday, yielding to pressure from reformist monks who have staged violent
protests.
The Rev Suh Eui-hyun has been criticised by reformers for abusing his office
by allegedly accepting bribes from monks who sought appointments to head
some of the Chogye order's 1,700 temples. The Chogye order claims 90 per
cent of the nation's 20m Buddhists, who account for almost half South
Korea's population.
Reformist monks attacked the Chogye temple headquarters in central Seoul at
the weekend after Rev Suh was elected for a third term. Intervention by riot
police to quell the protest provoked opposition charges that government was
supporting Rev Suh because he was allegedly involved in financing President
Kim's election campaign.
