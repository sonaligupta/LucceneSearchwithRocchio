FT  22 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (America): IBM results lend support to
the market

Wall Street
The focus of US equity investors shifted back to corporate profitability
yesterday and they were rewarded with a pleasant surprise from IBM, writes
Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 5.18 firmer at 3,732.45. The more
broadly based Standard & Poor's 500 was up 1.01 at 452.61 even though
declining issues on the Big Board outnumbered advances in brisk trading of
290.8m shares. The Nasdaq composite added 2.26 at 715.03.
After a session rattled by fresh uncertainty over interest rates, investors
started to concentrate again on how companies performed in the second
quarter, amid the pressure of a tightening monetary policy. There was enough
favourable news on offer to allow the market to reverse its slide and post a
slim gain in spite of misgivings over the economic fundamentals.
On Wednesday, Federal Reserve chairman Mr Alan Greenspan had triggered a
21-point decline in the Dow industrials by telling a Senate committee that
it remained an open question whether the central bank needed to lift rates
again to squeeze out inflationary pressures in the economy.
Yesterday there was conflicting evidence on the effect of the Fed's more
restrictive credit conditions. The July survey of business conditions by the
Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia suggested that growth in the region was
moderating but prices paid by businesses were on the rise.
In spite of that unsupportive news, bonds were not a significant factor
influencing stocks yesterday. Investors in the equity market were free to
sift through a fresh pile of corporate results.
Among them, the most impressive performance belonged to IBM, which
confounded analysts by posting second-quarter earnings of Dollars 1.14 a
share, against forecasts of 73 cents. The stock surged Dollars 6 3/4 to
Dollars 62 3/8 in heavy volume of 8.8m shares.
The buying enthusiasm spilled over into other comp-uter-related issues,
helping to stem losses set off earlier in the week by weaker than expected
results from Compaq, Intel and Lotus Development. On the Nasdaq, Apple was
Dollars 1 3/8 ahead at Dollars 28.
Semiconductor stocks showed some strength, with Texas Instruments up Dollars
1 1/8 to Dollars 77 3/4 and Allied Materials 1 7/8 better at Dollars 44.
Among the blue chips, however, the upturn in IBM's share price was partially
offset by a sharp downturn in the value of United Technologies' stock. It
dropped 5 per cent, or Dollars 3 3/8 , to Dollars 63 even though the
company's earnings had improved 32 per cent in the quarter.
In other Dow industrial issues, Caterpillar disappointed the market with its
second-quarter performance and fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 106 3/8 . But
Sears Roebuck, which dipped on the release of its results the previous day,
rallied Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 47 3/8 .
QVC slipped Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 44 1/4 after Comcast joined Liberty
Media in a Dollars 44 a share all-cash offer for the home-shopping network.
The combined bid, which sweetens an earlier offer by Comcast of Dollars 44 a
share in cash and stock, reduced the likelihood that a rival suitor would
emerge.
Canada
Toronto ended moderately lower in a session dominated by the release of
second-quarter financial results by some of Canada's largest companies.
The TSE 300 index receded 9.1 points to 4,172.6. Falls led rises by 385 to
307 and volume was light at 41.4m shares.
DuPont Canada, whose 'A' shares gained CDollars  3/4 at CDollars 18 1/4 ,
said net income rose to 49 cents a share in the second quarter from 31 cents
a year earlier. Imperial Oil shed CDollars  3/8 to CDollars 40 1/2 on poorer
second-quarter and six-month results.
Mexico
Equities closed almost 1 per cent higher, the first gain in five sessions,
on the back of a rebound in bellwether shares of telephone monopoly
Telefonos de Mexico SA (Telmex), whose 'L' shares gained 1.5 per cent at 9.4
new pesos. The IPC index put on 21.86 at 2,232.81.
Brazil
Shares in Sao Paulo closed off 0.5 per cent in light trade as investors
remained worried about liquidity problems in the banking system. The Bovespa
index dipped 201 to 40,185.
Brokers said there were rumours that some financial institutions were facing
difficulties in liquidating fixed-income operations, in spite of the central
bank's reduction in the discount rate late on Wednesday.
