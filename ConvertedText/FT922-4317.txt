FT  05 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Sector buying enlivens
hesitant US trading

Wall Street
US prices moved in a narrow trading range yesterday as investors and dealers
treaded cautiously ahead of today's important employment report for May,
writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 7.26 at 3,399.73. The
more broadly based Standard & Poor's 500 also ended slightly lower, down
1.33 at 413.26, while the Amex composite gained 1.53 at 397.18 and the
Nasdaq composite slipped 1.67 to 588.26. Turnover on the NYSE was 206m
shares.
Although there was steady two-way trade throughout the session, and certain
sectors attracted strong buying (most notably car stocks), the market's
attention was primarily focused on the May employment figures due out this
morning. The consensus of forecasts is for a rise in non-farm payrolls last
month of about 100,000.
The figure will be closely watched for its policy implications. A big rise
in payrolls will probably kill off any remaining hopes for another interest
rate cut, while an unexpectedly small increase, or decline in the number at
work, could prompt the Federal Reserve to ease monetary policy one more
time.
Among individual stocks, motor manufacturers were well-bid, the sector
buoyed by Wednesday's ten-day domestic car sales data which showed improving
demand for new autos. Ford rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 48 1/8 in turnover
of 2.8m shares, General Motors added Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 43 5/8 in 4m
shares, and Chrysler advanced Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 20 5/8 in 3.9m shares.
Coca-Cola eased Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 42 3/4 in heavy trading after
saying it was comfortable with estimates that it will earn between 42 cents
a share and 44 cents a share in the second quarter.
Also weaker were ITT, down Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 63 3/8 after Goldman
Sachs reduced its earnings estimates for the company's fiscal 1992 and 1993
earnings. Goldman's buy rating, however, was unchanged.
USX-US Steel rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 26 1/8 in turnover of 2.4m shares
after an issue of 7m additional shares of the common stock was sold at a
price of Dollars 25.50 a share. The size of the offer was raised at the last
minute due to strong demand.
On the Nasdaq market, Altera tumbled Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 13 1/4 after
the company said that the second quarter would not meet market expectations,
mostly because of competition from Cypress Semiconductors and slow business
in Japan.
Canada
TORONTO stocks closed steady in moderate trading. According to preliminary
figures, the TSE 300 was off 3.92 points, or 0.12 per cent, to 3,403.42.
Declining issues led advances 296 to 245.
Volume was 29m shares, down from the previous 30.6m, and trading value fell
to CDollars 325.6m from Wednesday's CDollars 374.6m.
Nine of the 14 stock groups closed lower, with the biggest decline in the
consumer products group, off 1.08 per cent.
