FT  11 MAR 93 / International Company News: Cruise operator plans flotation


   By NIKKI TAIT


ROYAL Caribbean Cruises, one of the largest cruise ship operators in the US,
is coming to the stock market.
The Miami-based company made its 'initial public offering' filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday.
It did not detail the precise timing for the flotation, nor the number of
shares to be offered. However, it did register 9.08m shares at a proposed
maximum offering price of Dollars 19 a share, and said the proceeds would be
used to repay secured debt facilities. Anything remaining would go for
'general purposes'.
Royal Caribbean was formed in the late 1960s by three Norwegian shipping
companies - I. M. Skaugen, Gotaas Larsen and Anders Wilhelmsen - and merged
with Admiral Cruises in 1988. That year, Anders Wilhelmsen bought out the
other partners, and then set up a joint ownership arrangement with interests
related to Chicago's Pritzker family. Today, Royal Caribbean operates nine
ships - a number of which are part of the current generation of
'mega-ships,' sleeping over 2,000 passengers.
The cruise industry has fared better than most leisure-related sectors
during the recession, with the number of people taking cruises increasing by
about 10 per cent a year.
