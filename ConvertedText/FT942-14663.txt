FT  19 APR 94 / International Company News: Enso to bid for balance of Dutch
offshoot

Enso-Gutzeit, the Finnish forest products group, said yesterday it planned
to tighten its grip on Berghuizer Papierfabriek, its struggling Dutch paper
subsidiary, through an offer for the outstanding shares in the company.
'The offer would be a first step towards a further integration of Berghuizer
into the Enso group, with the intention of providing better safeguards for
(its) continuity', it stated. Enso already owns 57.8 per cent of the
company.
Berghuizer specialises in high quality copying and writing papers. Last year
it made a Fl 14.8m (Dollars 7.7m) loss on sales of Fl 194.8m. It is not
expected to improve this year.
Enso said its offer would be based on a price of Fl 50 per Berghuizer share,
against a Fl 47 market price.
