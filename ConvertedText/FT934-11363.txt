FT  01 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Rebel Ferranti shareholders to meet over 1p
takeover bid


   By PETER JOHN


REBEL shareholders of Ferranti International, the defence electronics group,
are to meet to discuss ways of resisting a bid which offers them only 1p a
share.
Some shareholders have reacted angrily to the token offer by GEC which
promises them just Pounds 10m while at least Pounds 100m will go to the
banks.
They have commissioned Katz Associates, an investment consultancy, to see if
there are alternatives to the GEC bid.
It is expected that the complicated share structure of Ferranti and the need
for any bid to be accepted by 90 per cent of the voting shareholders will be
severe obstacles to the smooth take-up of GEC's offer.
Mr John Katz, who heads the consultancy and who recently fought a bid for
the Greycoat property group on behalf of unhappy shareholders there, said he
had received a number of phone calls since his name was first linked to the
Ferranti situation last week.
'The deal proposed looks like a quick safety net for the banks,' he said.
'I have written to Eugene Anderson (chairman of Ferranti who was taken on
three and a half years ago to save the company) and advised him that any
sale of the company for a token price will be opposed unless there is some
platform for shareholders to remain in to some extent and recover something
with time.'
Mr Katz said there was unlikely to be unequivocal opposition to a rescue
package of some sort as some 4,000 jobs were at risk if a saviour could not
be found.
Before the news of GEC's offer broke last week Ferranti's shares were valued
at 9 1/4 p.
By the close of trading on Friday they stood at 1 1/2 p but Ferranti's board
has defended the bid on the grounds that the company has no alternative.
A meeting of shareholders is expected to be held within the next two weeks.
