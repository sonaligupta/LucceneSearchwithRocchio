The Nikkei closed virtually unchanged in pre-holiday trading, with most
investors cautious over the volatility in the currency markets, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei index slipped 3.90 to 19,725.25 after a high of 19,762.95 and a
low of 19,644.53. The yen rose Y0.30 to Y102.38 triggering profit-taking in
electronics, precision instruments and automobile stocks by overseas
investors.
Volume was 210m shares against 219m on Wednesday. The Topix index of all
first section stocks edged up 1.82 to 1,603.33 and the Nikkei 300 rose 0.40
to 293.10. Gainers led losers by 507 to 440, with 203 issues remaining
unchanged.
In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 0.10 to 1,302.56.
Traders said that the inauguration of Mr Tsutomu Hata's government yesterday
did little to help investor confidence: because the coalition does not have
a majority within the parliamentary lower house, some investors expect it to
be forced out within a couple of months after the budget bill is passed.
Some steel shares were higher on a rise in steel production figures and
reduction of inventories. Kawasaki Steel rose Y10 to Y371 and Nippon Steel
gained Y5 to Y347. Electric blast furnace steels were also higher with Tokyo
Tekko rising Y100 to Y1,200 and Tokyo Steel up Y130 to Y2,390.
Sumitomo Coal Mining, the most actively traded issue of the day, lost Y23 to
Y970 on profit-taking, while Pacific Metals declined Y4 to Y451.
Profit-taking also depressed some high-technology stocks. Sony fell Y130 to
Y5,760, TDK lost Y90 to Y4,580 and Hitachi declined Y6 to Y960.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone lost ground for the fourth consecutive day,
declining Y3,000 to Y882,000. East Japan Railway fell Y1,000 to Y482,000.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 61.16 to 22,018.49 in volume of 25.1m shares.
