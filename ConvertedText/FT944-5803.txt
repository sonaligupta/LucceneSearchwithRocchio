FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (10): Entrepreneurial spirit
abounds - British Coal / Michael Smith discusses privatisation plans


   By MICHAEL SMITH


British Coal has long proclaimed that there is plenty of entrepreneurial
spirit among its employees, even if it has been in the public sector for 47
years.
Proof has arrived over the past year through the emergence of five
management buy-out teams bidding to take over some of the mines which are
being, or have been, privatised this year.
Two are already up and running and producing coal from pits closed by
British Coal in the past two years. They are both single-pit companies, one
operating out of Betws in south Wales, the other from Hatfield in Yorkshire.
The other three MBOs were all playing for higher stakes, bidding for one or
more of the five regions to be sold to the private sector later this year.
It is likely that only one of these three will be successful. Celtic Energy,
led by British Coal's opencast director in south Wales, has been selected as
the government's preferred bidder for south Wales.
The other two put in credible bids. English Coal, led by Bob Siddall,
British Coal opencast director, wanted all three English region. Northern
Coal, led by Alan Houghton, central north director, bid for the region
encompassing the Yorkshire pits.
That they failed, or are likely to fail, is at least partly because they did
not offer enough money. RJB Mining became the government's preferred bidder
for all three English regions by putting in a tender for Pounds 900m. That
beat English Coal's offer by at least Pounds 300m.
English Coal and Northern Coal's only chance now is that RJB will fail to
raise the money to finance the bid.
Like RJB, Celtic Energy's success was due in part at least to the size of
its bid. According to NM Rothschild, which advised the government, each of
the preferred bidders offered the most amount of money for the region or
combination of regions for which they were chosen.
Celtic's achievement is all the more notable because south Wales was by far
the most popular of the five regions on offer, with at least eight companies
or consortia putting in tenders.
Rival bidders included Mitsubishi, the Japanese conglomerate, in one
consortium, and Wimpey, the construction group, and Powell Duffryn, the
engineering company, in another. Ryan Group, an established mining company,
was another contender.
But if beating them was impressive, Celtic now faces the more arduous task
of making money out of what it has won. Neither it nor the government is
saying how much it bid for south Wales but analysts think it was about
Pounds 95m.
According to an analysis by Coal UK, the FT newsletter, that makes the bid
extremely expensive when compared to deals involving mining assets in other
parts of the world.
David Price, Coal UK editor, says the bid equates to Pounds 1.79 a tonne of
reserves and Pounds 47.50 a tonne for saleable coal. Typical values in
recent international deals around the world are about 30p a tonne and Pounds
20 a tonne for saleable coal.
Yet, the south Wales region has a relatively small contract with the
electricity generators. The 1m-tonne-a-year deal it inherits from British
Coal to supply National Power until 1998 is tiny when compared with the 29m
supplied to National Power and PowerGen from the central England regions.
In addition, the bid would run into severe difficulties if National Power
were to close its Aberthaw power station, which takes all 1m tonnes.
Nonetheless south Wales was not the most popular bid target in the the
British Coal privatisation for nothing. Aberthaw seems unlikely to close
before 1998 and could last much longer than that. In addition, much of of
the 2.4m tonnes a year of coal produced from the Welsh mines, all of which
are opencast, is high-quality anthracite.
A naturally smokeless product, it can attract premium prices, sometimes more
than Pounds 100 a tonne, which is more than double the price of coal sold by
British Coal and its successors to the electricity market.
In addition, Celtic Energy has, in Mr Riddleston, a leader who is an
enthusiast for the anthracite coal, or black diamonds as he calls it, which
his company will produce.
The selection of Mr Riddleston and his team was not greeted with universal
acclaim. The opencast section of the Transport and General Workers' Union in
south Wales passed a motion of no confidence in Celtic shortly after it was
selected as preferred bidder.
Mr Riddleston's track record is good. A 46-year-old graduate in chemistry
and a qualified accountant, output has almost doubled from British Coal's
south Wales opencast sites since he took over the job six years ago.
Celtic's backers include Charterhouse Development Capital. It has been
advised by KPMG Marwick.
The two MBO pits already running - Betws and Hatfield - are trying to make
money out of pits that in the latter years of British Coal's stewardship
were unprofitable.
Betws Anthracite, led by Martin Cook, former deputy manager in British Coal
days, is already exceeding its weekly target after taking over in April. The
company says it more breaks even by producing 2,340 tonnes a week but has
recently been producing 2,500 tonnes.
The 100 employees are achieving high levels of productivity by returning to
traditional mining methods using shovels rather than mechanical coalface
shearers. Betws has borrowed more than Pounds 2.5m, mostly from Barclays
Bank.
Hatfield Coal, which employs 180 men, expects to produce just under 400,000
tonnes a year when in full swing. Nigel Lowry, finance director, said in the
year to June next year output should be about 250,000 to 300,000 tonnes.
All of its output will go to the industrial and household markets, whereas
previously British Coal sold coal to the electricity generators from the
pit. The buy-out is backed by ECI Ventures.
Elsewhere in British Coal, at least two more MBOs are likely to make bids
for non-mining businesses which are being sold off in the next few months.
An MBO is among four organisations which are on a shortlist of four to bid
for Coal Products, the smokeless fuel subsidiary. Centris, the pensions and
insurance arm to be sold next year, is also likely to attract an MBO bid.
