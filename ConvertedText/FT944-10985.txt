FT  08 NOV 94 / International Company News: Minolta returns to black on
sales increase


   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO

Cost-cutting measures and increased sales helped Minolta, the Japanese maker
of cameras and office machinery, return to the black in the first half of
the year.
Non-consolidated recurring profits - before extraordinary items and tax -
were Y542m (Dollars 5.5m), a turnround from the Y1.1bn loss a year ago. Net
profit was Y386m, compared with a net loss of Y1.5bn previously.
The improvement came on the back of a 4 per cent rise in sales to Y92.7bn,
from Y89.2bn, which was achieved in spite of sluggish capital spending in
Japan and the yen's sharp appreciation against the dollar.
However, Minolta was unable to make a profit at the operating level,
although it trimmed operating losses to Y1bn from a previous Y2.3bn. The
company passed its interim dividend and does not expect to pay a dividend at
the year-end.
Minolta said that cost-cutting measures, such as the increased
standardisation of parts and greater overseas procurement, had helped it
improve results in the first half.
The company, which exports 75 per cent of its products, expects to increase
procurement of parts from lower cost overseas markets to 12 per cent in
value terms in the current year, compared with 4 per cent last year.
In its office machinery division, the inclusion of sales of assets related
to its planetarium business, which has been sold to a subsidiary, helped
boost revenues by 6 per cent.
Minolta expects sales of its new models to gather pace in the second half,
particularly in the US where demand has been strong. As a result, the
company has revised upwards its full-year sales forecast to Y191bn compared
with an earlier prediction of Y189bn, although its forecasts for recurring
profits and net profits are unchanged at Y1bn and Y600m, respectively.
