   PARIS


Seita, the French state-owned tobacco company which manufactures Gauloises
and Gitanes cigarettes, will be privatised next year, the government
announced yesterday, AP reports from Paris.
The sale will probably take place in the second half of the year 'or even
earlier if possible,' Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, a government spokesman, said after
the weekly Cabinet meeting.
The cabinet adopted a draft law setting in motion several reforms necessary
before Seita can be brought to the market.
The decision followed an announcement by Mr Jose Rossi, the industry
minister, on Monday that the government intends to privatise the Renault
vehicle group in the second half of 1995.
Seita is the world's foremost manufacturer of dark-tobacco cigarettes and
one of the leading cigar manufacturers. It also makes pipe tobacco and
matches. Its total revenues in fiscal 1993 were Dollars 2.39bn.
