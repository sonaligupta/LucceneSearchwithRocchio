FT  22 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls despite
optimism on economic recovery


   By EMIKO TERAZONOand REUtER


Tokyo, Singapore
Prospects of an economic recovery and expectations of buying by public funds
were ignored, and share prices lost ground on selling by investment trusts
and institutional investors, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average was off 157.84 at 20,622.92 after a day's high of
20,767.65 and low of 20,608.72. Volume came to 258m shares, against 310m,
and equities declined throughout the day amid a lack of participants due to
prevailing uncertainty over the course of the yen.
The Topix index of all first section stocks slipped 13.51 to 1,651.98 and
the Nikkei 300 lost 2.67 at 299.55. Declines led advances by 771 to 249,
with 167 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.86 to
1,337.88.
Investors did not react to Wednesday's Bank of Japan quarterly economic
report which concluded that the Japanese economy was headed for recovery
owing to rising consumption, fiscal stimulus and growth in overseas markets.
Meanwhile, the release of Y1,000bn in postal insurance money on Wednesday,
of which 50 per cent is expected to be placed into the stock market over the
next few months, also failed to boost share prices.
Traders said that while investors were still nervous over currency
fluctuations, prospects of buying by public funds prevented selling. 'There
is likely support around the 20,500 level,' said one Japanese broker.
High-technology exporters were lower on small-lot selling by domestic
institutions. Mitsubishi Electric dipped Y11 to Y698 and Sony Y60 to Y5,950.
Reports that utilities would continue to pass on the benefits of the high
yen by cutting rates hit electric power and gas companies. Tokyo Electric
Power, for instance, receded Y30 to Y3,000.
Hopes of increased capital spending boosted Komatsu, the construction
machinery maker, in the morning session. However, later profit-taking eroded
the gain and the stock, the most active issue of the day, closed a net Y8
down at Y945. Daifuku, a factory equipment maker, put on Y30 at Y1,360 and
Kato Works, a truck crane company, firmed Y8 to Y748.
Speculative trading supported Tomoegawa Paper, which rose Y80 to Y566, while
Oriental Yeast advanced Y80 to Y1,360 on the second section.
In Osaka, the OSE average declined 120.73 to 23,085.08 in volume of 45m
shares.
Roundup
There was a mix of performances among the region's markets yesterday.
Baring Securities turned more bullish on Asian equities yesterday, Reuter
reports from Singapore. Mr Alan Butler-Henderson forecast that Hong Kong and
Thailand would lead a rally which could last between six to nine months,
based on chart analysis.
He expected the Hang Seng index to climb to 9,800-10,600 by end-September,
and to 11,000-12,000 by end-December; while he estimated that the SET index
would rise to 1,550-1,650 by end-September and to 1,700-1,850 by the end of
the year.
TAIPEI finished at its highest level since June 1990, with paper stocks
leading the rally, while plastics halted three days of falls to resume an
upward momentum.
The weighted index ended 103.40, or 1.6 per cent, up at 6,577.70, its best
close since June 7, 1990. But turnover fell to TDollars 91.5bn from
Wednesday's TDollars 105.9bn.
Papers led the gains on hopes of a rise in pulp prices, with Chung Hwa Pulp
and Taiwan Pulp both advancing by the daily 7 per cent limit to TDollars
48.40 and TDollars 38.30 respectively. Among plastics, China Petrochemical
strengthened TDollars 2.20 to TDollars 37.40.
SHANGHAI saw a sell-off of large-capitalisation stocks and the blue chip
Pudong which took the A share index down 3.5 per cent to its lowest finish
since early 1993.
The index dropped 13.67 to 380.95 in thin turnover of Yn237m, against a
daily average of around Yn1bn in the first five months of this year.
The A index has lost 76.8 per cent from its peak in February last year,
pressured by the rapid expansion of new listings and heavy issuances of
state bonds. In the past three months alone, the A index has slid more than
800 points.
In Shenzhen, the A index weakened 1.4 to an all-time closing low of 97.91.
HONG KONG had an initial fall cut back as a wave of bargain hunting pushed
the Hang Seng index back above the 9,100 benchmark. The index ended 71.16
down on balance at 9,117.66, after losing 160 points at one stage.
Much of the profit-taking was attributed to renewed worries about rising US
interest rates, while lower than expected Bank of East Asia results
accelerated selling.
Bank of East Asia retreated HKDollars 1.10 to HKDollars 32.30 after
announcing a 12.1 per cent rise in net profits for the first half of 1994,
compared with market expectations of a 20 per cent increase.
The news fuelled profit-taking in HSBC, which fell HKDollars 1.25 to
HKDollars 89.25, while its Hang Seng Bank subsidiary dipped 50 cents to
HKDollars 54.50.
SINGAPORE was easier as investors sold amid worries of higher US interest
rates, although the underlying mood was said to be still positive. The
30-share Straits Times Industrial index closed 22.86, or 1 per cent, lower
at 2,208.51.
SEOUL remained in the doldrums and stocks closed lower for the seventh
consecutive session, although low-priced small-capitalised counters, lightly
weighted on the index, attracted some interest. The composite index declined
1.32 to 935.35.
KUALA LUMPUR lost 1.3 per cent in a decline led by falls in Tenaga Nasional
and Telekom Malaysia. The Composite index gave up 13.36 to 996.36.
Tenaga and Telekom, which account for more than a third of the composite
index, fell 30 cents and 50 cents respectively to MDollars 13.10 and
MDollars 19.
MANILA lost ground for the second day in a row as investors continued to
take profits. The composite index ended 14.92 down at 2,648.54 in volume of
499.12m shares worth 772.8m pesos.
Metropolitan Bank and Trust was the day's top gainer, ris-ing 1.4 per cent
to 690 pesos.
Losers outpaced rises by 33 to 24. San Miguel, the country's largest food
and beverage conglomerate, posted the biggest decline, sliding 2.7 per cent
to 90 pesos.
PLDT and PNB defied the downtrend, the former climbing 1.3 per cent to 1,520
pesos and the latter 5 per cent to 420 pesos.
SYDNEY closed broadly lower, hit by weakness in markets elsewhere and
accompanied by a fall in futures prices.
The All Ordinaries index registered a fall of 29.4 at 2,049.2, after a low
for the day of 2,043.2. The September futures contract lost 40 at 2,057,
after touching 2,054.
Coles Myer ended 2 cents off at ADollars 4.29, after rising to ADollars 4.52
earlier. Brokers said the news that Kmart planned to sell its 21 per cent
stake in the company removed a long term problem from the share price.
Banks fell in line with renewed pressure on bond prices, with NAB shedding
18 cents to ADollars 10.96 and ANZ 17 cents to ADollars 4.09.
WELLINGTON buckled under the weight of selling from one large foreign
portfolio to close weaker on the day. The NZSE-40 capital index lost 18.74
at 2,036.20 in turnover worth NZDollars 157m.
Volume was the highest seen in several months, but brokers explained that
there had been a degree of duplication as a portfolio had been sold to one
Wellington-based broker, who sold to clients and on to the open market.
BANGKOK fell back on profit-taking amid expectations of higher interest
rates. The SET index surrendered 21.58 to 1,342.01 in moderate turnover of
Bt9.88bn.
Banks and finance issues dominated trading but most falls were limited. The
bank and finance sectors retreated 1.72 and 2.51 per cent respectively. The
two accounted together for Bt4.56bn turnover.
