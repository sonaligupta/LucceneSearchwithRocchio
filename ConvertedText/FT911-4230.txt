FT  20 APR 91 / International Company News: Regulators take control of
Standard Trustco

FEDERAL regulators have taken control of troubled Standard Trustco, closing
its 37 trust and mortgage offices across Canada until further notice.
Plans by Montreal's Laurentian Bank to take over the branches and part of
the trust business, and subsequent court action by 25 institutional
creditors to put Standard Trustco into bankruptcy, are in abeyance.
Mr Michael Wilson, finance minister, said the move was necessary to
'maintain confidence in Canada's financial institutions' although Standard
Trustco is the ninth largest trust company in Canada.
The company and the Ontario government expressed astonishment at the move to
have a receiver appointed, saying the Laurentian deal was a good solution to
Standard Trustco's problems.
The company holds about CDollars 1.5bn (USDollars 1.29bn) in deposits but
has a Dollars 350m non-performing property loan portfolio. Most of the
deposits are covered by Canada Deposit Insurance Corp, up to Dollars 60,000
per depositor.
Federal officials said the closures were intended to prevent a run by more
than 100,000 Standard Trustco depositors. They will try to maintain the
healthy parts of the business.
In Montreal, Laurentian said it was still interested in negotiating with
whoever ends up running Standard Trustco.
Canada Packers, 56 per cent held by Britain's Hillsdown Holdings, is
expected to sell its loss-making Western meat-slaughter business by the end
of next week and its edible oils division soon afterwards.
