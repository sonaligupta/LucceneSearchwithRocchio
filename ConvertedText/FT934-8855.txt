FT  13 NOV 93 / ANC to dominate country's top court


   By PATTI WALDMEIR

South Africa's proposed constitutional court, the main institution charged
with protecting the country's fledgling democracy, is likely to be dominated
by political appointees chosen by the African National Congress.
According to joint proposals from the ANC and the ruling National Party, to
be incorporated in the new constitution to be finalised early next week, the
new President (likely to be from the ANC) will effectively control the
appointments of all 11 Constitutional Court members. He must consult the
multi-party cabinet before deciding, but no other party is likely to be able
to muster sufficient support to overrule him.
The liberal Democratic Party last night condemned the proposal, saying it
jeopardised the independence of the judiciary and 'could result in the most
important court in South Africa being politicised, centralised and
hand-picked by a new government.'
The proposal is especially important because the court will play a big role
in determining the nature of the new South African government. Given the
large number of vague compromises in the draft constitution, the court will
have considerable powers of interpretation.
The proposal comes at the end of a week in which the National Party has made
numerous concessions to the ANC on issues such as the country's official
language as well as the powers of regional governments in policing.
Unable to decide on one national language, the ANC/NP opted to have 11
official languages. This is likely to mean English will be the de facto
official language.
The National Party has undermined its claim to have negotiated a federal
constitution by agreeing that South Africa should have one national police
force rather than regional forces as demanded by regionally-based parties.
