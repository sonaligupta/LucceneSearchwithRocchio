FT  19 APR 94 / International Company News: NationsBank maintains margin


   By RICHARD WATERS


   NEW YORK


Recent increases in US interest rates failed to dent the net interest income
of NationsBank during the first quarter of the year, enabling the North
Carolina-based commercial bank to report stronger than expected earnings.
The net interest margin on NationsBank's underlying loans business was
maintained at 4.16 per cent, identical to the year before, despite increases
in money market interest rates.
US banks increased their prime lending rates - the rates on which loans to
many customers are based - by only a quarter of a percentage point at the
end of March, lagging the half-point rise in money market rates engineered
by the Federal Reserve during the first three months of the year.
Yesterday's quarter-point rise in money market interest rates threatens to
eat further into banks' interest margins, which have stood at historically
high levels in recent quarters.
However, Banc One said yesterday it was boosting its prime lending rate by
half a percentage point to 6.75 per cent, having raised it from 6 per cent
at the end of March.
Including the lower-yielding trading assets of Chicago Research and Trading,
a derivatives company acquired last year, the net interest margin at
NationsBank as a whole was 3.69 per cent.
