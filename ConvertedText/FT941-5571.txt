FT  05 MAR 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Copper brightens LME
gloom


   By RICHARD MOONEY


Copper shone dimly through the London Metal Exchange gloom this week. As
prices of most base metals tumbled the exchange's flagship contract rallied
to end Dollars 27.25 up at Dollars 1,914.75 a tonne for three months
delivery.
Copper's relative strength was built on the solidity of support below
Dollars 1,870 as tonne revealed by a sharp fall in the first half of the
week. Signs of a tightening nearby supply situation fuelled the rise
yesterday, when the cash discount against three months metal narrowed from
Dollars 19 to Pounds 13.25 a tonne. A week earlier it had stood at Dollars
23.
Supply tightness was also behind the only other LME rise on the week - for
aluminium alloy. As the market responded to scrap shortages (the contract is
based on secondary aluminium), falling stocks and forward technical
tightness the three months price yesterday touched Dollars 1,225 a tonne,
the highest since its launch 17 months ago, and the cash discount (or
'contango') against metal for delivery in three months, which in mid-week
stood at Dollars 18 a tonne, turned into a Dollars 10 premium (or
'backwardation').
By the close the three months price was back to Dollars 1,217.50 a tonne, up
Dollars 45 on the week, and the backwardation had moderated to Dollars 5 a
tonne.
The primary aluminium contract also made ground yesterday as investment fund
buying helped it to recoup some of the losses suffered early in the week on
disappointment that producer representatives meeting in Ottawa had only
rubber-stamped output cutting proposals drafted last month in Brussels.
In the absence of further cutback announcements from producers adding to the
three months price dipped to Dollars 1,270 a tonne at on point, before
closing yesterday at Dollars 1,302.50, down Dollars 12 on balance.
The LME's heaviest loser was lead, with the three months position closing
yesterday at Dollars 455.50 a tonne, down Dollars 33 overall. Yesterday's
Dollars 4 fall was attributed to technical selling after chart analysts said
Thursday's break of support at Dollars 460 a tonne had confirmed a 'head and
shoulders' formation, signalling further falls.
Negative chart factors also hit the zinc market, sending the three months
position to Dollars 934.25 a tonne, down Dollars 39.25 on the week.
Gold's reputation as a haven in times of economic trouble took another knock
this week as turmoil in the financial markets failed to prevent a break
through the bottom end of its recent trading range.
The London bullion market price was fixed yesterday morning at a three
months low of Dollars 375.65 a troy ounce before closing at Dollars 376.60,
down Dollars 2.10 on the week. 'It suggests a fund is getting out,' one
dealer told the Reuter news agency.
After a shaky start coffee futures were rescued on Thursday by Brazil's
announcement that it was set to fulfil its obligations under the
multinational export retention scheme after reaching a new financing
agreement with producers and exporters.
The success of the retention plan, agreed last September, in lifting coffee
prices out of the doldrums had been undermined recently by Brazil's
continuing failure to put into store the full 20 per cent of its export
shipments required under the scheme.
Before the Brazilian announcement May delivery coffee was quoted at Dollars
1,216 a tonne at the London Commodity Exchange, but by Thursday's close it
was up to Dollars 1,232 and yesterday it moved on to Dollars 1,248, up
Dollars 13 on the week.
