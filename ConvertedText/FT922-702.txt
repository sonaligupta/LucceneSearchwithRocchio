FT  26 JUN 92 / Letter: Interest rates' influence on consumption


   From Messrs COLIN HARTE and ALAN DOYLE


Sir, Michael Lipton (Personal View, June 24) has a very strange idea of the
role of real interest rates in influencing inter-temporal consumption and
production decisions. He is absolutely correct when he says that 'long-term
interest rates in real terms are a classic market signal'. Rather than
encouraging present consumption and resource depletion, however, they
encourage the exact opposite. Which is precisely why they are used as a
macro-economic policy measure - to encourage saving rather than consumption.
The example of the Indian farmer is misleading. Faced with high long-term
real interest rates, the 'fierce arithmetic signal' is to use less capital
intensive production methods - appropriate technology in the jargon (which
may well encourage lower but more sustainable production) - rather than to
go for the high return extractive production path. Only in the short term
can it be claimed that high real interest rates will force production of the
extractive rather than sustainable variety - and high real interest rates
have been around since the very late 1970s.
