   NEW YORK


MERCK, the world's largest pharmaceuticals company, yesterday posted
fourth-quarter net profits 20 per cent higher at Dollars 529.8m, or Dollars
1.37 a share. Sales rose 10 per cent to Dollars 2.3bn.
Sales growth would have been 2 percentage points higher but for the rise in
the dollar exchange rate since last year, which caused lower dollar
translation on Merck's 46 per cent overseas sales.
The strong performance was led by Merck's newer drugs. The company's
Vasotec, Vaseretic and Prinivil blood-pressure drugs and its Mevacor and
Zocor cholesterol-reducing drugs, brought full-year earnings to Dollars
2.12bn, or Dollars 5.49 a share, up about 19 per cent.
Sales for the year advanced 12 per cent to Dollars 8.6bn from Dollars
7.67bn.
Merck also benefited from favourable tax rates in 1991. Pre-tax earnings for
the fourth quarter rose 19 per cent to Dollars 790.7m and for the year grew
17 per cent to Dollars 3.17bn.
The company said yesterday its new drug application for Proscar, to treat
and control benign prostate disease, would be reviewed by the Food & Drug
Administration's advisory panel on February 4.
Warner-Lambert, based in Morris Plains, New Jersey, turned in underlying
fourth-quarter earnings of Dollars 121m, or 90 cents a share, up 15 per cent
from Dollars 105m, or 78 cents, a year earlier.
The company took an after-tax restructuring charge in the quarter of Dollars
3.11 a share which resulted in a fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 297m, or
Dollars 2.21 a share.
Sales rose 7 per cent to Dollars 1.34bn from Dollars 1.25bn.
For the year, Warner-Lambert posted net income of Dollars 34.8m, or 26
cents, on sales of Dollars 5.06bn, compared with earnings of Dollars 484.9m,
or Dollars 3.61, on sales of Dollars 4.69bn.
Stripping out one-time items, the company's earnings rose 15 per cent to
Dollars 559m, or Dollars 4.16 a share.
Warner-Lambert has also increased its annual dividend to Dollars 2.04 a
share from Dollars 1.76.
