FT  26 MAY 93 / International Company News: Deere to take Dollars 80m charge
to cover Europe staff cuts

DEERE and Company, the tractor and heavy equipment maker, intends to reduce
its western European workforce by 25 per cent and to take an Dollars 80m
charge to second-quarter earnings to cover the restructuring.
The company reported second-quarter net income of Dollars 110.2m, or Dollars
1.44 per share, before the charge. Including the charge, Deere earned
Dollars 30.2m, or 39 cents, against last year's second-quarter results of
Dollars 44m, or 58 cents.
Deere intends to reduce its European workforce by 2,000 people in the next
few years, with about 1,200 of the redundancies to be recorded in 1993.
It has 8,000 employees in Europe, and makes agricultural machinery and
engines at plants in Germany, France and Spain.
Strong sales in North America offset weakness in Deere's European operation,
said Mr Hans Becherer, chairman. 'Excluding the restructuring charges,
results for the quarter were significantly better than last year as a result
of substantially improved North American operations.'
Worldwide sales and revenues increased by 13 per cent to Dollars 2.10bn in
the second quarter, from Dollars 1.85bn last time. Of the total, North
American equipment sales were up 20 per cent at Dollars 1.34bn, and overseas
equipment sales rose 3 per cent at Dollars 448m. Its financial services arm
had second-quarter sales of Dollars 295m, up 7 per cent over the second
quarter of 1992.
Worldwide production tonnage was up 7 per cent in the second quarter, and is
now projected to be 8 per cent higher for the year.
Deere said its new tractor line enjoyed strong sales in the second quarter,
but European results remained soft.
'Although reception of our new tractor line has been positive, industry
retail sales of agricultural equipment in Europe are expected to continue
the downward trend of recent years as European agriculture goes through a
period of fundamental change,' Mr Becherer said.
'As a result, our overseas margins continue under considerable pressure.'
