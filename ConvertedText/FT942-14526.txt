FT  20 APR 94 / People: Ralfe joins Anglo board


Gary Ralfe, who headed the negotiations which drew the former Soviet Union
formally into the world's diamond cartel, has joined the board of the Anglo
American Corporation of South Africa. He became managing director of the
Central Selling Organisation, the London-based business through which De
Beers controls about 80 per cent of the world's trade in rough (uncut)
diamonds in January.
Ralfe, 49, was born in South Africa and joined Anglo American in 1966. He
was appointed a director of De Beers, Anglo's sister group, in March 1990.
That was the year he signed a Dollars 5bn, five-year contract with the
former Soviet Union, which gave the CSO exclusive marketing rights to most
of the Soviet rough diamond production. At the same time De Beers advanced a
Dollars 1bn loan to the Soviet Union and moved some diamond stocks from
Moscow to London as collateral. Ralfe has been at the forefront of
subsequent negotiations - successful so far - to keep the deal in place
following the break-up of the Soviet Union.
Anglo has also appointed Nap Mayer, managing director of its gold and
uranium division, an alternate director.
