FT  29 APR 94 / UK Company News: Hobson seeks Pounds 73m to help buy CWS
manufacturing side


   By DAVID BLACKWELL


Hobson, the vehicle for 28-year-old Mr Andrew Regan, is planning to buy the
food manufacturing division of Co-operative Wholesale Society Limited for
Pounds 111m.
The deal will be financed through bank debt and the issue of 296.3m shares
at 27p, to raise about Pounds 73m net of expenses.
Some 98.4m shares are being placed firm with a further 94.2m placed subject
to a 1-for-1 clawback to existing shareholders. The balance of 103.7m are
being offered to the public. Hobson is also proposing a reduction in
capital.
Hobson has a market capitalisation of Pounds 25m. The shares, traded on the
USM, were suspended on February 10 at 27p pending the announcement. Mr Regan
became chief executive after reversing Cadismark, his household products
business, into Hobson at the end of 1992.
The CWS division, known as FMG, mainly supplies own-brand label goods to the
Co-op. It made a profit last year of Pounds 9.8m on sales of Pounds 304.2m,
of which Pounds 221.6m were made to the Co-op. Three years ago sales to
other retailers, including Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway, were Pounds 51.8m,
of which Pounds 38m were non-milk. Last year total sales rose to Pounds
82.6m, of which Pounds 78m were non-milk.
Mr Regan said the company was under-achieving with margins of about 3 per
cent. A target of 6 per cent in two years would be realistic. He also wanted
to continue the rapid rise in sales outside CWS, however, in order to
protect its turnover, Hobson has a supply agreement with CWS for three
years.
Once shareholders approve the offer at an EGM on May 23, Hobson will request
dealings to restart on the Official List.
COMMENT
The retailers must be rubbing their hands with glee as another own-brand
supplier with excess capacity joins a fiercely competitive market. Assuming
that by the end of next year the new management has doubled margins to 6 per
cent, earnings per share would emerge at 3.9p. This puts the shares on a
multiple of 6.9, which looks attractive and should ensure a premium. Hobson,
however, is operating at the sharp end, and could soon find itself running
hard to stand still.
