RUHRKOHLE, the German coal producer, will seek private financing to build a
36km-long road tunnel under the densely-populated Ruhr valley, Germany's
industrial heartland.
The project, unveiled at the weekend by Mr Heinz Horn, chief executive of
Ruhrkohle, received immediate support from leading politicians, including Mr
Norbert Blum, the federal labour minister.
It plans to build a toll tunnel from Mulheim to Dortmund under the current
A40 motorway which is plagued by chronic traffic congestion. The cost the
project was estimated at DM10bn (Pounds 4bn). The tunnel would have two
additional exits for Essen and Bochum, the region's largest towns.
A spokesman for Ruhrkohle, which produces 80 per cent of west German coal,
said the company was convinced the project would be viable and would seek
domestic and international investment for it.
The Ruhr valley, which stretches north of Dusseldorf, has a population of
5.3m people and holds the highest concentration of industries in Europe.
Ruhrkohle, which has successfully diversified nearly half its turnover in
activities like environmental technologies and infrastructure projects, said
it had conducted studies showing the tunnel was geologically possible. The
company said it hoped to provide technical know-how for the project.
The project could considerably boost the Ruhr valley, which is trying to
diversify away from its traditional reliance on coal and steel industries.
The region has succeeded in the past 10 years in becoming a centre for
environmental technology, one of the Germany's most profitable export
industries.
