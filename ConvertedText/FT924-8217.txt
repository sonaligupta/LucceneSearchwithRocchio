FT  12 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Alliance shareholders seek dismissal of
board in wake of receivership


   By PEGGY HOLLINGER


SHAREHOLDERS representing more than 10 per cent of Alliance Resources, the
Louisiana-based natural resources company that went into receivership last
month, have called for the board to be dismissed.
Mr Graham Wilson, the administrative receiver, said yesterday that
shareholders had requisitioned an extraordinary meeting to consider
dismissal of the three directors and their replacement by four new
candidates.
The EGM would look into possible claims against directors over alleged
breaches of obligations to the company.
New candidates proposed by the shareholders include Mr John O'Brien, former
Alliance chairman and managing director of Manx Petroleum, which called in
the receiver over default on a loan agreement.
The other three are Mr John Craven, former employee of Cluff Resources, run
by Manx chairman Mr Algy Cluff; Mr Marcus Black, formerly of broker Greig
Middleton; and Mr Russ Hammond, ex-managing director of Greenwell Montagu,
and well known to the independent oil sector. Mr Hammond holds 6 per cent of
Alliance.
The receiver on Monday dismissed the directors of Alliance's US subsidiary
and only significant asset, which had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection last month. Mr O'Brien was appointed president of the subsidiary.
Mr O'Brien, dismissed as chairman of Alliance in October, said he hoped a
compromise could be reached before the EGM was called. However, he added:
'If they don't call an EGM, it doesn't matter . . . Manx is running the
company. The plc (the parent company which held the shares of the US group)
has no function.'
