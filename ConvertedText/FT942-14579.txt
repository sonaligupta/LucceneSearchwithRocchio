FT  20 APR 94 / Factories attacked in Indonesia

   MEDAN


Protesters ran riot through factories yesterday in Medan, north-western
Indonesia's industrial centre, tearing apart a doll-clothes factory and
wrecking cars in the sixth day of labour-related protests, Reuter reports
from Medan.
Labour activists said two of their leaders had been arrested and branches
across the country were warned against launching sympathy strikes. 'Many of
our branch leaders were approached by soldiers making threats and
frightening them into not taking part in action, particularly in the Jakarta
area,' said one unionist at the independent Indonesia Labour Welfare Union
(SBSI).
Several factories in Tanjung Morawa, near Medan, were badly damaged by
youths. Citra Sandang Graha, a doll-clothes factory, was gutted while a
motorcycle parts manufacturer was also damaged.
