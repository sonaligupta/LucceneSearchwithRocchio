FT  29 APR 94 / Portillo assails Labour record


   By JAMES BLITZ


The Conservative party yesterday underlined the importance of next week's
local council elections in London by launching an all-out attack on the
record of Labour-run boroughs in the capital.
With only a week to polling day, the Tories produced an extensive dossier on
the policies of Labour councillors, claiming that they levied the highest
taxes, were the worst at collecting their rents and have run up the largest
debts.
Mr Michael Portillo, the minister in charge of the party's London campaign,
said: 'Labour councillors in London, as elsewhere, are more interested in
their latest politically correct scheme than with providing high-quality
services.'
He claimed that race and sex equality programmes in Greenwich had cost local
taxpayers Pounds 15m in one year alone, some 7 per cent of council spending.
Labour immediately hit back at allegations of over-staffing in their borough
departments. It argued that Tory councils had disguised manpower levels by
transferring staff to the private sector via compulsory competitive tender.
The party also rebutted criticisms of corruption in its councils, claiming
that 'Tory Westminster' was the 'biggest single corruption scandal in local
government'. A district auditor has claimed that the party wasted more than
Pounds 21m through an unlawful 'designated sales policy'.
Tory party managers hinted yesterday that they regarded the poll in the
London Borough of Brent as one of special significance. The party has had
overall control for four years and says that the controversial record of the
previous Labour administration has made the opposition unelectable.
'Under Labour, Brent was Britain's nightmare borough,' said Mr Bob Buckman,
the council leader.
However, Tory control is under threat since Labour needs less than a 5 per
cent swing in votes to take control.
