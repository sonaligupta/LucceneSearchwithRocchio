FT  19 MAY 92 / International Company News: Power Corp of Canada seeks
'special situation'


   By ROBERT GIBBENS


   MONTREAL


POWER Corp of Canada, the holding company of Montreal financier Mr Paul
Desmarais, plans to invest in a 'special situation' in North America by the
year-end but still has not found a potential acquisition that meets its
criteria.
Mr Desmarais said Power Corp and its financial services arm had between
CDollars 2bn and CDollars 3bn available. The company sold two subsidiaries
in 1989 and has almost no debt.
Also, Power Corp and the Frere Group of Belgium have 63 per cent voting
control of the European holding company, Pargesa. It owns one of North
America's biggest life insurance companies and Canada's biggest mutual fund
distributor.
Power Corp earned CDollars 39.2m (USDollars 32.9m), or 30 cents a share, in
the first quarter, up from Dollars 31.2m, or 23 cents a year earlier, on
consolidated revenues of Dollars 1.52bn, against Dollars 1.56bn.
After Power Corp's annual meeting, Mr Desmarais said he would take a
minority position in a healthy North American company needing new capital
'as long as we can participate in management and can attain our target 15
per cent return on equity'.
A large takeover was currently difficult because of the high level of the US
stock market, he said, but Power Corp was concentrating on North America
because Pargesa's growth can be self-financing.
Mr Desmarais said he preferred manufacturing, communications and financial
services as target sectors.
A USDollars 422m takeover of International Corona of Vancouver by Homestake
Mining has been delayed without explanation.
The US mining giant offered 0.35 of a Homestake share for each Corona share.
The merger would create a mining group with annual output of 1.8m ounces of
gold a year.
