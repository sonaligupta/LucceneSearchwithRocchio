FT  14 APR 94 / Top Peronist pulls out of assembly


   By JOHN BARHAM


   BUENOS AIRES


One of the leading figures in Argentina's governing Peronist party has
announced she will not take her seat in an assembly convened to rewrite the
country's constitution.
Peronist leaders held Ms Matilde Menendez responsible for the party's
unexpected defeat in the city of Buenos Aires in the assembly elections on
Sunday. She was alleged to have been involved in a corruption scandal.
The elections were held to select 305 delegates to a constituent assembly
which would allow President Carlos Menem to run for a second presidential
term in 1995. The current constitution bans successive presidential terms.
Mr Menem's Peronists took 38.8 per cent of the national vote - more than any
other party - but lost the federal district of Buenos Aires, the national
capital, by a wide margin to the Frente Grande left-wing alliance.
Ms Menendez said late on Tuesday she would not participate in the assembly
but would concentrate on the 'clarification' of allegations of corruption at
PAMI, the government health scheme for the elderly which she runs.
The alliance had campaigned on an anti-corruption platform and it alleged
bribery at PAMI. However, Ms Menendez says she will not resign as its head.
Allegations of corruption have dogged Mr Menem's administration since it
took office in 1989 but legal investigations have rarely been conclusive.
But, on Tuesday, a federal judge acquitted Mr Menem's sister-in-law, Ms
Amira Yoma, of accusations of laundering drug money in 1990-91 while she was
Mr Menem's personal secretary.
Argentina's trade deficit widened by 329 per cent in January to Dollars
585.6m (Pounds 397m), the second biggest expansion of the deficit since
Argentina stabilised its economy in 1991. The country has run a trade
deficit almost every month since November 1991. The deficit of Dollars
3.68bn last year was 40 per cent higher than in 1992. Imports in January
rose by half to Dollars 1.53bn but exports rose only 5 per cent to Dollars
946.5m.
