FT  11 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: US cuts duty on Canadian
magnesium

THE US Department of Commerce has confirmed that Norsk Hydro Canada's
revised electricity contract with Hydro-Quebec does not amount to a subsidy.
This means that Canadian pure magnesium metal will now face a 7.6 per cent
US countervailing duty, down from 21.6 per cent set last July.
Norsk Hydro Canada, which operates a USDollars 400m export magnesium plant
near Montreal, has said it will continue to use Canada-US Free Trade Pact
channels to try to get the remaining duty withdrawn.
Pure magnesium still faces a US anti-dumping duty of 31.33 per cent, in
addition to the 7.6 per cent countervailing duty. Alloy magnesium is not
subject to the anti-dumping duty.
