FT  20 NOV 92 / Observer: Revving up


'An ace in the Avvocato's new hand of poker' was how one Italian paper
described Giorgio Garuzzo after this week's management shake-up at Fiat.
The 'Avvocato' is, of course, Gianni Agnelli, the grand old man of Italian
business who steps down from the Fiat presidency in 1994.
Aside from naming his brother Umberto as his successor, the Avvocato has
kept everyone guessing as to the future shape of the management team. By
being given the new post of chief operating officer with control over all
industrial operation, the 54-year-old Garuzzo has been fingered as the man
most likely to take over as chief executive officer from Cesare Romiti.
At 69, Romiti is two years younger than his boss but is expected to leave
either with him or before him. Umberto Agnelli at 57 is of a different
generation and is personally closer to Garuzzo.
With Fiat since 1976, Garuzzo's career conforms to the classical image of a
modern industrial manager in northern Italy. In 1984 he was chosen to run
Iveco, the commercial vehicles group.
He joined the 'nomenklatura' in 1980 when he was promoted to be president of
Fiat Auto, replacing Umberto Agnelli.
