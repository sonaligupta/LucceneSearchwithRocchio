FT  30 OCT 93 / Russian deputy PM milks poverty ticket


   By JOHN LLOYD


   MOSCOW


MR SERGEI SHAKHRAI, a deputy prime minister and one of Russia's leading
political figures, has sought to steal a march on other candidates in the
forthcoming parliamentary elections - by declaring his poverty on the front
page of the country's leading daily.
It is a move calculated to win support from a population deeply cynical
about their politicians' ability to enrich themselves through office.
It comes as the Central Electoral Commission has declared 25 parties or
groupings registered for the election so far - with many of the established
and aspirant names in Russia's political scene evident among their leading
candidates for the 450-seat State Duma, or lower house of the proposed new
parliament.
The key groups are Russia's Choice, led by Mr Yegor Gaidar, the deputy prime
minister; the Yavlinsky-Lukin-Boldyrev bloc, led by Mr Grigory Yavlinsky,
the prominent economist; the grouping Civic Union in the name of Stability,
Equity and Progress, headed by Mr Arkady Volsky, the industrialists' leader;
the August party headed by Mr Konstantin Borovoi, the entrepreneur; the
Russian All-Peoples' Union, led by Mr Sergei Baburin, the nationalist
leader; the Movement for Democratic Reform, headed by Mr Gavril Popov, the
former mayor of Moscow; and Mr Shakhrai's own Party of Russian Unity and
Agreement - which, however, is not yet registered.
Mr Shakhrai's initiative appears to be an attempt to distinguish himself
from candidates compromised by as yet unproven charges of corruption.
In a declaration which Izvestiya published as its lead story yesterday Mr
Shakhrai revealed that he earns Rbs332,000 (about Pounds 187) a month as
deputy premier; that he has two young children and a non-working wife who
live in a three-room flat (but expect to move to a five-room flat); that he
shares a Volga saloon with relatives and that 'each member of the family has
a bicycle;' that he has Rbs14,000 (Pounds 7.86) in the savings bank.
Mr Shakrai admits that he has the use of a four-room state dacha, but adds
that it lacks 'a sauna, swimming pool, cook and servants,' just in case
anyone thought he was enjoying himself.
