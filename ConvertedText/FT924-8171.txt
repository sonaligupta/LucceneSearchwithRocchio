FT  12 NOV 92 / Acting union to sue BBC over sales


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


EQUITY, the actors' union, has decided to take the BBC to court over the
sale of its programmes to UK Gold, the entertainment channel launched on
satellite at the beginning of this month, Raymond Snoddy writes.
Even before the channel was launched Equity announced it was ending its
agreement with the BBC covering payments for programmes sold to satellite
channels and overseas broadcasters.
UK Gold, whose founding shareholders include the BBC and Thames Television,
is based entirely on library programmes such as Miss Marple and Bergerac
from the BBC and Minder and The Bill from Thames.
Equity claims the current agreement with the BBC does not cover UK Gold and
that the sales are in breach of copyright legislation.
The union will be asking the court to declare the BBC's sales to UK Gold
illegal and will be seeking damages.
Equity has rejected deals based on 4 per cent of actors' original fees and
17 per cent of the gross sales figure to distribute to actors.
