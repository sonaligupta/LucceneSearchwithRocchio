FT  22 APR 91 / Disinflation and convergence


   By MARTIN WOLF


1990 AND early 1991 have seen monetary contraction in most of the world's
main economies. Monetarists would argue that this also explains why it has
been a period of recession in the US and UK, and of slowdown in most of the
other big countries.
Particularly significant has been the decline in the year-on-year rates of
growth of US M2, the country's most closely watched index of broad money.
The year-on-year rates of growth of broad money also fell sharply in the UK,
although they have remained very high by any other country's standards.
Under the ruthless guidance of Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of
Japan, the year-on-year rate of growth of Japan's M2 plus certificates of
deposit (CDs) has halved, accompanied by the stock market crash, whose
effect appears in the rise in the yield on equities. France, too, has seen a
slow-down in the growth of broad money since early 1990 and a more rapid
slowing still in the growth of narrow money. For its part, Italy has avoided
a decline in the growth rate of broad money, although the year-on-year
growth rates of narrow money have fallen.
The main exception to the general trends is Germany, not only because of the
direct effects of economic and monetary union last July, when D-Mark
monetary stocks jumped by about 15 per cent: driven along by unification,
even the growth rates of the monetary stocks in west Germany did not fall in
1990, as in other big countries, although they did not accelerate
significantly either.
Whether the monetary expansion that followed unification will prove
inflationary is uncertain, depending as it does on economic behaviour in
east Germany. But unification has already had an important effect on German
monetary conditions and on convergence within the European Community, via
the interest rate.
As the chart shows, long-term rates of interest have converged among the
four large economies in the EC. This matters because the German government
has stated that interest rate convergence is one of the conditions for
movement to economic and monetary union in the EC, arguing that it would
also indicate convergence of long-term inflationary expectations.
Yet the marked convergence that can be seen in the chart is a result of the
virtue of the other three only to a modest degree, at least over the past
five years. It is also a reflection of doubts about Germany, where the
long-term nominal rate of interest has risen by 2 percentage points above
its level in 1988. Whether this increase reflects higher inflationary
expectations or higher real interest rates within an imperfectly integrated
global capital market, it has done far more for interest rate convergence
than lower rates in the other countries.
All this emerges from the third table in our new series of indicators for
the six largest industrial countries, which follows the National Accounts
(April 8 1991) and Balance of Payments (April 15 1991). The table presents
the most broadly watched monetary aggregates and interest rate series in
each of these six countries.
The narrow measures of money supply (M0 and M1) include highly liquid,
generally non-interest bearing assets, while the broader measures (M2, M3
and M4) include assets that are likely to be used as a means of saving as
well.
In the US the Federal Reserve has argued that the long-run growth of M2
should approximately equal the trend growth in output, if price stability is
to be achieved. M2 has remained within its target range of 3-7 per cent in
both 1989 and 1990 while the provisional target for 1991 has been reduced to
2 1/2 -6 1/2 per cent. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan has announced a
projection of 8 per cent growth for M2 plus CDs in the year to the first
quarter of 1991, a forecast that seems eminently reasonable.
Abstracting from the one-off impact of German monetary union, the
Bundesbank's 1991 target for the growth of all-German M3 is 4-6 per cent.
According to the Bundesbank's own calculations (not reported in the table)
growth of all-German M3 between the fourth quarter of 1990 and February
1991, on an annualised basis, was 3.5 per cent. This is below the official
target range, although it is expected to rise once more. Meanwhile, growth
of all-German M1 between November 1990 and February 1991 was 6.1 per cent.
For 1991 the table shows month-on-month growth rates for all-German money,
starting with January 1991 over December 1990.
For EC member countries other than Germany the principal monetary indicator
is the exchange rate against the D-Mark within the exchange rate mechanism
of the European monetary system. In the case of the UK, for example, the
Financial Statement and Budget Report released at the time of the March
budget, states that 'interest rate decisions must now be set consistently
with keeping sterling within its announced bands.' But some countries have
supplementary monetary targets.
Like the Bundesbank, the Banque de France, has chosen M3 as its target
indicator, its range being 5-7 per cent, marginally less expansive than the
growth of 8.5 per cent between 1989 and 1990.
In the UK, by contrast, the extraordinarily rapid growth of broad money led
the authorities to abandon it in the mid-1980s. The target is M0, instead,
which is almost entirely cash in circulation. The current aim, growth of 0-4
per cent in the financial year starting April 1991, is fully consistent with
recent performance.
