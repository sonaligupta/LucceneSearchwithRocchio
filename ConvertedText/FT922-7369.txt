FT  19 MAY 92 / International Company News: Sumitomo Realty suffers setback


   By EMIKO TERAZONO


SUMITOMO Realty and Development, the Japanese real estate developer,
yesterday reported a steep decline in non-consolidated pre-tax profits for
the fiscal year ended March.
The fall was due to sharp increases in interest payments and appraisal
losses on its securities holdings.
Pre-tax profits plunged 30.6 per cent to Y25.2bn (Dollars 193.5m), despite a
19.3 per cent increase in sales to Y223.2bn and a 24.7 per cent rise in
operating profits to Y66bn. After-tax profits fell 0.4 per cent to Y19.6bn.
Sumitomo's non-operating deficit grew 2.5 times to Y40.8bn due to a 25.2 per
cent fall in interest and dividends received and a 20.5 per cent increase in
interest payments to Y41.2bn. The company booked Y11.4bn in latent losses on
its securities holdings.
Short-term borrowings grew by 13.3 per cent to Y410bn while long-term
borrowings surged by 3.1 times to Y47.4bn. Sumitomo plans to procure fresh
funds of more than Y100bn through bank borrowings and corporate bond issues.
For the year to March 1993, the company expects pre-tax profits to decline
18.8 per cent to Y20.5bn on a 7.5 per cent rise in sales to Y240bn.
