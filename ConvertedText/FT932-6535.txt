TWO US oilmen working in a remote part of Yemen have been abducted by
tribesmen, Reuter reports from Sana.
The two Americans and their Yemeni driver, all working for Dallas-based Hunt
Oil, were ambushed on Tuesday afternoon in an area where Hunt has a big
concession. The government was negotiating for their release, a company
source said.
Several Hunt employees have been abducted in the past two years by
tribesmen. All have been released unharmed.
