FT  26 JUN 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Computers display cunning
adaptation


   By PAUL TAYLOR


For the international traveller packing a portable computer, few things are
so infuriating as finding that the plug on the end of the modem cable will
not push into the hotel telephone socket just when you want to access the
home office database.
Surrey-based Impactron has come up with a solution. The International Travel
Kit is a set of adaptors which allow a BT-approved modem to be connected
quickly and reliably to almost any phone network. (A similar kit is
available for those with US-style modem plugs.)
The kit, which costs Pounds 95, contains adaptors for more than 20
countries, including the EC, Japan and the US. The kit has an adaptor with
crocodile clips 'enabling access to be made directly into a convenient wall
box.' Impactron:UK 081 390 8522.
