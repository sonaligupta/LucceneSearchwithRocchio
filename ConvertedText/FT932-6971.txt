FT  26 MAY 93 / Virgin Music puts Thorn EMI ahead to Pounds 289m


   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent


THORN EMI saw full-year pre-tax profits almost double to Pounds 289.9m from
Pounds 147.9m, aided by a strong contribution from its newly-acquired Virgin
Music Group.
Sir Colin Southgate, chairman, said despite an improvement in the UK market
the recession appeared set to continue in continental Europe and recovery in
the US seemed at best gradual.
The pre-tax figure was struck after exceptional charges of Pounds 51.9m in
the latest year and Pounds 88m a year earlier. Operating profit rose 34.9
per cent to Pounds 379.3m in the year to March 31 1993, including Virgin's
10-month profit contribution of Pounds 53.1m. Turnover was up 12.6 per cent
to Pounds 4.45bn. Earnings per share was 45.3p (against 22.5p a year
earlier) before exceptionals. Adjusted earnings per share, excluding
exceptional items, rose from 42.7p to 53.9p. The final dividend is 23p,
bringing the full-year payment to 32p (from 30.1p).
The group, whose interests include music, white and brown goods rental,
light fittings, defence and security, reported under the FRS3 standard, with
the previous year's figures restated.
Sir Colin said the group did not expect to be affected by a Monopolies and
Mergers Commission inquiry into UK compact disc prices. 'We don't expect to
lose it. We welcome it because we can get the matter sorted out for once and
for all,' he said. Sir Colin said the integration of Virgin's manufacturing
and distribution into Thorn EMI would be completed next year. The music
division's operating profit rose to Pounds 196.9m (from Pounds 125.1m).
Rental operating profit increased to Pounds 115.3m (from Pounds 105.9m),
lighting was up to Pounds 15.2m (from Pounds 12.6m) and the HMV music
retailing chain rose to Pounds 2.6m (from Pounds 1.3m).
Profit at Thorn Security and Electronics plunged to Pounds 1.5m from Pounds
13.2m. Sir Colin said management deficiencies, since corrected, had also
resulted in cost overruns on three defence contracts. He said Thorn still
hoped to sell its defence business.
Exceptional items of Pounds 51.9m included a Pounds 21.1m profit of the sale
of the fire appliances division to Williams Holdings. This was offset by a
number of charges, the biggest being a Pounds 62.6m write-down relating to
Thames Television, which has been sold to Pearson, publishers of the
Financial Times.
