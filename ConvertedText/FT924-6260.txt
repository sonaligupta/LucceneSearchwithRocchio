FT  21 NOV 92 / France wants Pounds and lira in ERM


   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor


FRANCE 'earnestly wishes' to see the pound and the lira return to the
European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) as quickly as possible, Mr Michel
Sapin, the French finance minister, said in London yesterday, writes Robert
Mauthner, Diplomatic Editor.
He told the Royal Institute of International Relations the fact that there
was now a de facto core of two stable currencies in western Europe, the
D-Mark and the French franc, should not act as a pretext for the exclusion
of other currencies from closer monetary integration.
He was fundamentally opposed to a 'two-speed Europe', which would relegate
such an important participant in the Community's development as Britain to
the sidelines.
However, Mr Sapin, who held up the stability of the franc in relation to the
D-Mark within the ERM as one of the main reasons for France's economic
success over the past six years, was implicitly critical of the British
government's decision in September to float the pound.
A strong currency resulted in less imported inflation as well as the
obligation to keep up and constantly improve the economy's competitive edge.
A reduction of cost and price inflation, as had been achieved by France, was
a prerequisite for growth.
'I am convinced that the policy of competitive devaluation does not allow
one to reach this goal,' the minister said.
