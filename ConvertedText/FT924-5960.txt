FT  24 NOV 92 / Observer: Schlesinger's last laugh


Less than 18 months after taking the helm, Bundesbank president Helmut
Schlesinger has stamped his authority on the central bank's policy-making
council in a way his cannier and more 'political' predecessor, Karl Otto
Pohl, would have envied.
The land (state) presidents on the council - which takes decisions by
majority voting, on the basis of one-man one-vote - had been known to give
Pohl a hard time, and Schlesinger too had an early taste of the rebellious
streak when he was outvoted on the scale of an interest rate increase agreed
last December.
Now a reorganisation of the Bundesbank's council has been effected - one
objective of the Pohl presidency left unaccomplished when he resigned last
year - that makes such defeats less likely.
During the past year, Schlesinger had already presided over changes in the
permanent Frankfurt-based directorate which meant that the seven men were
increasingly cast in the president's mould. Now, even though the east is
represented, the number of land presidents on the council has been reduced
from 11 to 9.
Indeed, for procedural reasons, four land presidents have yet to take up
their seats - leaving Schlesinger's directorate temporarily well in the
ascendancy with seven votes against the lander contingent of only five.
So expect Schlesinger to be able comfortably to follow his instinct and wait
at least until the beginning of next year before cutting the bank's discount
or Lombard rates.
Meanwhile, the new-look council will be a rather duller place. In addition
to the departure of Bremen's Kurt Nemitz - a man reputed never to have voted
for an interest rate increase in his life - Wilhelm Nolling from Hamburg is
also off. Always to be relied upon for a steady stream of verbal fireworks,
he will be missed.
