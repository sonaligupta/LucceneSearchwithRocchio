FT  16 DEC 94 / International Company News: Tenneco to expand gas operations


   By REUTER


   HOUSTON


Tenneco, the US energy and chemicals group, is spending Dollars 120m on two
investments at Tenneco Ventures, a subsidiary of the company's gas division,
Reuter reports from Houston.
It said it was making a Dollars 75m acquisition of Pennzoil's offshore
properties and investing Dollars 45m in a Tenneco Ventures energy investment
fund.
Tenneco said the two investments supported its strategy of redeploying
capital into 'higher-return growth opportunities in its natural gas,
packaging and automotive parts businesses'.
It said the Pennzoil agreement, involving offshore oil and natural gas
properties in the Gulf of Mexico, would add more than 90bn cubic feet of
natural gas equivalent to Tenneco Ventures' reserve base.
The exact size of the Pennzoil transaction would be determined once other
parties had decided whether to exercise preferential rights to purchase the
reserves.
It said the Dollars 45m earmarked for the energy investment fund would be
invested in a combination of production, development and exploratory
properties in conjunction with independent producers.
