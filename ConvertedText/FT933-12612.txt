FT  23 JUL 93 / Toxic gas payouts accepted


OUT-OF-COURT settlements of between Pounds 2,000 and Pounds 40,000 for
long-term health problems caused by exposure to carbon monoxide have been
accepted by 28 factory workers.
The case, supported by the TGWU general union, was brought on behalf of the
workers who it was claimed were repeatedly exposed to high concentrations of
carbon monoxide from a leaking factory furnace between 1985 and 1986.
The company, Backer Electric, of Rotherham, South Yorkshire, was then owned
by Hollis Engineering. The company is now owned by a private consortium,
which said yesterday it was not involved in the case.
