FT  15 APR 94 / Lesotho soldiers kill deputy PM


   By REUTER


   MASERU


Dissident soldiers shot dead Lesotho's deputy prime minister yesterday and
seized four cabinet ministers, in a mutiny apparently over a planned
government probe into the army, according to diplomats, Reuter reports from
Maseru.
'The deputy prime minister, Solemetsi Baholo, is dead. He was shot while
resisting being taken by the soldiers,' one said. In Pretoria, the South
African Foreign Ministry said it was 'appalled by the developments' and
would not recognise any government installed by force.
But diplomats said there was no indication a coup was under way in the
mountain kingdom of 1.8m people, which is surrounded by South Africa, and
the mutiny was in just one section of the army.
