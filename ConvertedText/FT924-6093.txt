FT  23 NOV 92 / Construction Contracts: Air separation plant in Yorkshire


CLUGSTON CONSTRUCTION has begun work on a contract to build a Pounds 20m air
separation plant for Air Gas Production (AGP) at Eggborough power station in
North Yorkshire.
The plant, which has a 10 megawatt electrical load, is to be built on land
adjacent to National Power's Eggborough power station so that it can have a
direct electrical supply, avoiding the use of the local electricity system
and thereby reducing capital and running costs. AGP will create 35 jobs when
the plant is operational at the end of 1993.
The 10-year agreement with National Power is believed to be the first of its
kind and has been made possible by the privatisation of the UK electricity
industry.
It is also the first air separation plant to be built by AGP, a joint
venture between AGA Gas UK and Distillers MG, which are the UK subsidiaries
of AGA AB of Sweden and Messer Griesheim Gmbh based in Germany.
The construction contract for infrastructure, drainage, foundations and
buildings was awarded to Clugston by Linde AG of Germany, the turnkey
contractors.
The plant will produce nitrogen, oxygen and argon from atmospheric air for
industrial customers.
