FT  22 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: New issues


   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE


The decision this week by Telewest, the UK's largest cable operator, to
proceed with its flotation has come as a welcome relief to a new issue
market that is again dogged by negative news, writes Christopher Price.
Telewest postponed its original float date five months ago, citing difficult
market conditions.
The plan then involved selling a 20 per cent fully-diluted stake through a
placing and intermediaries offer in the US and UK. Such an offer would seek
to raise between Pounds 300m and Pounds 370m in new money.
There was also a positive debut from Servicair, which came to the market at
135p and went to a first day's premium of 3p.
But Filtronic Comtek, a manufacturer of components for the mobile
telecommunications industry, became the latest market debutant to disappoint
expectations.
Its shares were priced at 105p, valuing the group at Pounds 44.1m. This was
well below forecasts, which had ranged as high as Pounds 60m.
