FT  08 NOV 94 / Rakhmonov wins Tajik poll

   DUSHANBE


Mr Imamali Rakhmonov, Tajikistan's parliamentary chairman and acting head of
state, won the republic's first presidential election, taking 60 per cent of
the vote, according to official preliminary results announced yesterday. His
opponent, Mr Abdulmalik Abdulajanov, a former prime minister and at present
Tajikistan's ambassador to Moscow, won 35 per cent in Sunday's contest. An
official said more than 90 per cent of the 2.6m electorate had voted for a
new constitution, which among other things creates a presidential system. Mr
Abdulajanov's team alleged on Sunday there had been cases of ballot boxes
being fraudulently stuffed with votes for Mr Rakhmonov, and that other votes
had been tampered with.
Many opposition leaders are in exile in Afghanistan, from where their
fighters have been launching cross-border raids since losing a civil war in
late 1992. Some analysts said that, given an opposition boycott, the
election would not help resolve deep problems in Tajikistan, where clan
loyalty is seen as more important than ideology.
