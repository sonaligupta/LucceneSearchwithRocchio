FT  14 MAR 94 / UN observation teams arrive in Maglaj


   By Agencies


   BOSNIA


US gunships were ordered to strike at Bosnian Serbs firing at French troops,
but the raid was called off yesterday after Serb guns fell silent and bad
weather obscured the target, agencies report from Bosnia.
Shortly after the Nato attack order was rescinded, UN officials reported the
arrival of UN observation teams to Serb-besieged Maglaj.
Under attack by the Serbs since last June, the 19,000 residents of the
Moslem enclave in northern Bosnia have suffered great hardship, with all
land convoys blocked since last October. The latest development appeared to
represent a concession by the Serbs.
French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur made a surprise visit to French UN
peacekeeping units in the Bihac pocket of northern Bosnia yesterday where
the French last week lost one of their men to Serb Shooting.
