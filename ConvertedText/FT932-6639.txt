FT  27 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Courtaulds climbs to Pounds 193m - Sterling
devaluation and exceptionals behind 4% improvement


   By PAUL ABRAHAMS


THE DEVALUATION of sterling helped Courtaulds, the chemical materials group,
reveal pre-tax profits up 4 per cent from Pounds 186m to Pounds 193m for the
year to March 31.
The results were on turnover up 7 per cent from Pounds 1.94bn to Pounds
2.07bn. Operating profits moved to Pounds 208m (Pounds 206m).
However, at constant exchange rates, turnover, operating and pre-tax profits
would have been lower by Pounds 121m, Pounds 12m and Pounds 6m respectively.
The results were also helped by exceptional items producing a Pounds 1.7m
profit, compared with a Pounds 15.1m loss previously.
Net debt fell by Pounds 11m to Pounds 222m, mainly due to a Pounds 49m cash
repayment from the UK pension scheme. The results were compiled according to
the new FRS 3 accounting standard.
'We have held our own in sales and profits and maintained a strong balance
sheet while not stinting on investment,' said Mr Michael Pragnell, finance
director.
Performance materials recovered from a poor first half to generate most of
the group's growth in operating profits. The light armoured vehicle project
helped the division post a 50 per cent increase from Pounds 12m to Pounds
18m on turnover of Pounds 214m (Pounds 183m).
Coatings' profits fell from Pounds 59m to Pounds 58m, despite a strong
performance in the Far East, on sales of Pounds 729m (Pounds 675m).
The packaging division increased operating profits from Pounds 25m to Pounds
27m, on turnover of Pounds 260m (Pounds 244m). Sales of tubes grew by more
than 20 per cent, but the European operations had a difficult year.
Chemicals' profits fell by Pounds 1m to Pounds 41m, on sales down 7 per cent
from Pounds 233m to Pounds 216m. Demand for acetate products weakened, but
cost-cutting and sterling's devaluation helped the business, said Mr Sipko
Huismans, chief executive.
Fibres and films posted reduced trading profits of Pounds 71m (Pounds 73m)
on increased turnover of Pounds 667m (Pounds 582m), mostly due to the
acetate film joint-venture. Mr Huismans said the US market was proving
difficult.
The new Tencel factory was operating at 80 per cent capacity and the board
would consider commissioning a second line later this year, said Mr
Huismans.
Operating profits in the Asia-Pacific market, which includes Australasia,
increased 12 per cent to 28m (Pounds 25m) on sales of Pounds 230m (Pounds
205m). Asian profits alone increased 30 per cent on sales up 15 per cent.
European input fell to Pounds 114m (Pounds 115m) on sales up 4 per cent at
Pounds 1.27bn (Pounds 1.22bn). Static North American profits of Pounds 57m
were reported on turnover up 14 per cent at Pounds 588m.
Earnings per share increased by 2.6p to 37.6p. The recommended final
dividend of 10.2p makes a total of 14p (13p), up 8 per cent.
