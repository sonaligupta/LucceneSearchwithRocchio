FT  27 JAN 94 / Fresh threat faces EMA merger plan


   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor


The planned merger between the Engineers and Managers Association and the
British Association of Colliery Management is heading for collapse after a
High Court decision yesterday to allow a full judicial review of the case.
Leading officials in the union are trying to de-rail the merger - in spite
of an overwhelming vote in favour by its 5,000 members - arguing that the
union had not been properly informed of how far it would lose its identity.
Mr Justice Laws decided that the decision of the Trade Union Certification
Officer to go ahead with the merger, in spite of the change of heart by
Bacom activists, should be subject to judicial review. The case is likely to
be heard within the next two months. The union is also likely to hold a
fresh ballot.
In the meantime the merger remains in limbo and Mr John Meads, Bacom general
secretary, who supports the merger, remains suspended by the anti-merger
group.
