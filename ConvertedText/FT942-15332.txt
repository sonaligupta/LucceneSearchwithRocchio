FT  15 APR 94 / International Company News: Fortis advances 14% with help of
banking sector


   By GILLIAN TETT


Fortis, the Belgian-Dutch financial services group, yesterday announced a 14
per cent rise in profits last year, with total consolidated profits for 1993
of Ecu476.2m (Dollars 538.10m) compared with Ecu419.4m in the previous 12
months.
The results come after an eventful year for the group, which has seen it
sell a large stake in Generale de Banque, the Belgian bank, and acquire a
controlling interest in the Belgian ASLK-CGER banking and insurance group.
Fortis said the sale of its Generale de Banque shares had returned a large
capital gain.
However, it stressed that both its life insurance and banking sectors had
continued to expand in Belgium, the UK, the Netherlands and the US.
The biggest growth, the company said, was in the banking sector, where
pre-tax results had risen by 30 per cent.
However, the insurance sector of the group had also expanded, with pre-tax
results rising by 11 per cent.
The non-life sector recorded a Ecu7.9m loss in 1993, compared with a
Ecu15.8m loss the previous year.
The board has proposed a dividend of Fl 3.40 per ordinary share, up from Fl
3.20 the previous year.
