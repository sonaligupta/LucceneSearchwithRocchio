FT  24 AUG 92 / Letter: Closing off an open season


   From Mr PETER KLEEMAN


Sir, It seems incongruous that securities analysts are permitted to write
reports, presumably without direct corporate contact, during a company's
'close season'.
An altered profit forecast, without a right of reply, can have a devastating
effect on a company's market capitalisation. These regulations hardly seem
sensible, particularly for a nation that believes in fair play.
Perhaps the deafening silence from the corporate sector on this can now be
broken.
