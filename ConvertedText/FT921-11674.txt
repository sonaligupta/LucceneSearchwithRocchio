FT  30 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Sainsbury staff face Sunday pay cut


   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent


J. SAINSBURY, Britain's largest food retailer, yesterday announced new pay
rates for Sunday which will mean cuts for some staff.
Double-time overtime rates now paid for Sunday working will be replaced by
premium payments at up to 37p an hour less.
The move was attacked by Usdaw, the shop workers' union, which opposes
Sunday trading.
Usdaw fears the lower rates, which will come into effect in mid March, will
prompt other stores opening on Sundays to cut payments to their staff.
Sainsbury said that Sunday working would remain voluntary. However, it had
decided to change payments for those who chose Sunday as one of their five
working days in a week.
In some cases staff would receive more under the premium payments system,
the company said. Check-out operators with less than six months' experience
in central London would be paid more than double their normal hourly rate on
Sundays.
However, adult checkout operators in central London will receive Pounds 7.17
an hour instead of Pounds 7.54 under double time - a Pounds 2.22 loss for a
six-hour day.
Sainsbury said that it believed the new system was a much better arrangement
for all staff because it reflected how Sunday working would be part of a
scheduled five-day week.
Mr Terry Sullivan, Usdaw national officer, said the premiums would have been
lower but for union pressure. The voluntary nature of Sunday working was
threatened once Sunday was treated as part of the normal working week.
