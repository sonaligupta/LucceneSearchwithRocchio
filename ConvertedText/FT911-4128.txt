FT  20 APR 91 / Plea for longer period of formal education


   By ANDREW ADONIS


CALLS for a longer period of formal education, with everyone achieving
A-levels or their vocational equivalent, are made in two reports to be
published next week, writes Andrew Adonis.
Sir Christopher Ball, president of the Association of Colleges of Further
Education, says in a paper for the Royal Society of Arts that the 'vicious
circle' of low investment, low productivity, low skills and poverty of
aspiration will be broken only when all teenagers continue in formal
education or training until at least the age of 18.
He proposes a uniform structure of post-16 qualifications based on modular
courses, with a range of vocational options, to replace A-levels.
The creation of a department of education and training, with a single
council for 14 to 18-year-olds' qualifications to replace the hotch-potch of
curriculum and accreditation institutions, is proposed by Mr Stuart Maclure,
in a report for the Policy Studies Institute.
