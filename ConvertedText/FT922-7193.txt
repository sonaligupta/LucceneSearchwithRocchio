FT  20 MAY 92 / Advertising industry presses on EC rules


   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent


THE Advertising Association, which represents 26 leading advertising trade
bodies, today steps up its lobbying of the government, MPs and members of
the European parliament for further and wider deregulation within the
European Community.
In a document, The Spirit of '92, the association urges the government to
promote 'the construction of a Europe without national restraints on trade
or services, and to reinforce progress towards the acceptance of freedom in
communications, and truth in advertising'.
It calls on the government, during its presidency of the Council of
Ministers, to press for:
A declaration on the importance of advertising within the single market.
Freedom to advertise across national borders.
Full application of the principle of subsidiarity (giving member states
leeway in implementing EC regulations).
Promotion of self-regulation in advertising.
Rationalisation of proposals affecting food advertising.
Reconsideration of national restrictions on advertising.
Continued resistance to a proposed EC-wide ban on tobacco advertising.
