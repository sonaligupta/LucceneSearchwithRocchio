FT  23 JUL 94 / Consortium set to buy LT advertising


London Transport looks set to sell its advertising arm, London Transport
Advertising, to a consortium led by the largest transport advertising
company in the US, Transportation Displays Incorporated, and Hambro Group
Investments.
LT said yesterday that it was dropping all but two from its shortlist - the
consortium, and a management and employee buy-out. LT said the consortium
was its preferred bidder.
The decision means that a Monopolies and Mergers Commission investigation
into a bid for LTA by poster company More O'Ferrall is likely to be called
off. The company, which was on the shortlist until yesterday, would have
controlled about 38 per cent of London's outdoor advertising market if it
had been successful.
LT said the referral 'was not a factor' in dropping the company from the
shortlist.
