FT  11 MAR 94 / French act over Mafia influx


   By DAVID BUCHAN


   PARIS


Senior French and Italian magistrates and police yesterday met in the
southern French town of Aix-en-Provence to exchange information on fighting
organised crime.
The French justice ministry played down the significance of the meeting's
timing, planned five months ago. But it comes after last month's
gangster-style assassination of Mrs Yann Piat, a French MP who had crusaded
against corruption in the Var department. Two men are being held by French
police, but dozens of others, including local politicians, have also been
questioned.
According to one theory, Mrs Piat's death was a revenge killing for the
gunning down of a French underworld figure a year ago in Italy.
The two-day meeting in Aix reflects growing concern that the Mafia may be
spreading its activities into southern France, because of lucrative
investment opportunities in casinos and real estate and because it is under
increasing police pressure at home. Leading the Italian side at the Aix
meeting is Mrs Liliana Ferraro, the judge in charge of the Italian
government's fight against the Mafia.
Mr Charles Pasqua, last night campaigning in Nice for a conservative
candidate in Sunday's parliamentary election in the city, has promised to
clean up the Riviera. Last week he was presented with a report recommending
the creation of regional squads specialised in fighting organised crime.
