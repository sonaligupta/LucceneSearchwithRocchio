FT  10 JAN 92 / Full-time call-out for UDR after violence


   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent


PART-TIME soldiers of the army's Ulster Defence Regiment were called out
yesterday for full-time duties in Belfast for the second time in two months
to try to stem a spate of terrorist violence.
The measure, which follows demands for army reinforcements in response to
recent IRA bomb attacks in the city, affects several hundred soldiers
belonging to two UDR battalions in the greater Belfast area.
The army said the troops would be used 'as and when required' to support
police operations. The tightening of security in Belfast includes
reintroducing 24-hour road checkpoints.
Yesterday's move is aimed at containing the latest outbreak of violence by
redeploying forces in Northern Ireland before resorting to reinforcements
from the British mainland. Officials said troop requirements were
'constantly under review'.
There are 10,800 regular British troops in Northern Ireland, plus 6,100 UDR
members, of whom about half are part-time.
The two UDR battalions affected were also involved in the November call-out,
which covered 1,400 UDR part-timers and was the first such measure since
1988.
No major long-term reinforcement from the mainland has taken place since
1986 when two battalions were sent in response to mortar attacks on police
and army bases.
Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, said yesterday he hoped that
emergency provisions legislation which came into force last August would
lead to the successful prosecution of the 'godfathers' of terrorism in the
province.
Speaking at the Royal United Services Institute, he said the government was
committing 'the necessary resources' to Northern Ireland.
The search goes on: one of the new 24-hour check points
on the Falls Road in West Belfast yesterday
