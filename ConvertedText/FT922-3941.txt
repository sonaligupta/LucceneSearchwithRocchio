FT  09 JUN 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Benefiting the taxman -
In a Nutshell


Companies frequently lay themselves open to making unnecessary tax and
national insurance contributions by the way they treat benefits to
employees.
They may also incur penalties if they overstep the rules, according to
accountants Blick Rothenberg.
Most mistakes are made when companies reimburse employees for payments such
as credit card invoices, telephone bills, school fees, club subscriptions or
other personal spending made good by the employer.
A company which pays an employee's home telephone bill must make sure that
the bill is addressed to the company.
If it does this there will be no national insurance to pay though the
individual will be liable to pay income tax on the sum.
If the bill is sent to the employee's address, then the company, and
possibly also the individual, will have national insurance to pay as well.
A self-appraisal questionnaire to help employers spot problems is available
from Blick Rothenberg, 12 York Gate, London NW1 4QS. Fax 071 935 6852. Free.
