FT  19 APR 94 / International Company News: McDonnell Douglas down 38% as
airliner sales fall


   By MARTIN DICKSON


   NEW YORK


McDonnell Douglas, the US defence and aerospace group, yesterday reported a
38 per cent drop in first-quarter net income, due to unusual gains a year
ago.
Operating income, however, rose 20 per cent as improved efficiencies and
property sales helped offset sharply lower sales of commercial aircraft.
The group, which two years ago was suffering under a heavy debt burden, also
reported that stronger-than-expected cash flow of more than Dollars 430m had
allowed it to cut further its aerospace debt burden, which totalled Dollars
1.404bn at the end of March, compared with Dollars 1.625bn at the end of
December and down 49 per cent from the end of 1992.
The improvement came despite an 18 per cent drop in revenues, to Dollars
2.953bn from Dollars 3.617bn, the result of a 53 per cent drop in commercial
aircraft manufacturing sales.
The group's net earnings for the quarter totalled Dollars 134m, or Dollars
3.41 a share, compared with Dollars 216m, or Dollars 5.51 a share in 1993.
However, stripping out unusual gains last year totalling Dollars 122m, or
Dollars 3.10 a share, McDonnell group produced a rise of 42 per cent in the
net figure.
Mr Herb Lanese, finance director, said he was very comfortable with Wall
Street earnings per share forecasts of Dollars 12 to Dollars 13.50 for the
full year, given that the company's weakest quarter was traditionally the
first.
The military aircraft business produced operating earnings of Dollars 166m,
compared with Dollars 99m a year ago, largely due to the F/A-18 programme
and the C-17, a controversial military cargo aircraft which was profitable
in the quarter, compared with break-even last year.
The commercial aircraft side was marginally profitable, with Dollars 3m of
operating earnings against Dollars 12m a year ago, due to reductions in
overheads and improvements in productivity.
It delivered only four MD-80 twin jets and three MD-11 tri-jets during the
period, down from 11 and nine respectively a year ago.
Mr Lanese said that McDonnell expected twin-jet deliveries in the low 20s
and tri-jet deliveries around 20 in 1994, but he thought this would be the
low year of the current cycle, with the market improving in 1995 and 1996.
