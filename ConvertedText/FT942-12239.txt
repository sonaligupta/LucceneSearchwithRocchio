FT  30 APR 94 / UK Company News: Reece reduces losses to Pounds 195,000


Cost cutting measures helped Reece, the maker of equipment for the ceramic
and glassware industries, to reduce pre-tax losses from Pounds 662,000 to
Pounds 195,000 for the year to December 31.
Turnover edged ahead to Pounds 13.2m (Pounds 13.1m) although Mr Peter
Knapton, chairman, said UK sales had fallen with demand sluggish, prices
under pressure and the demise of a number of smaller customers.
The largest contributor to 1993 profits, Service (Engineers), had started
1994 well, Mr Knapton said, and now had a stronger order book than at any
time in the last two years.
Losses per share were cut to 0.16p (0.52p). The shares lost 1p to close at 3
3/4p.
