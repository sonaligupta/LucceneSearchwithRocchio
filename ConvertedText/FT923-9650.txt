FT  04 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Futures funds industry
welcomes CFTC decision

THE MANAGED futures funds industry has welcomed last week's decision by the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to ease regulations on
sophisticated investors who participate in commodity pools and funds.
Known as rule 4.7, the measure exempts highly-accredited investors, or what
the CFTC calls 'qualified eligible participants,' from the normal rigorous
and time-consuming disclosure, reporting and record-keeping requirements
that would apply for such investments.
The industry had long pressed for the rule change, which is comparable to
the Securities and Exchange Commission's 'accredited investor' rule,
applicable for securities investments exclusively regulated by the SEC.
Commodities pools and funds are jointly regulated because, while they
contain futures, they are securities vehicles.
The CFTC's original proposal for rule 4.7 included a stricter definition of
qualified eligible participants. Individual investors had to have at least
Dollars 5m in assets, and at least Dollars 1m in initial margin monies on
deposit with futures brokers. These amounts have now been reduced to Dollars
2m in assets and Dollars 200,000 in margins.
For institutional investors, the original proposal required Dollars 10m in
assets. This has been reduced to Dollars 5m. In addition, foreign investors
can now be defined as qualified eligible participants even without passing
the asset tests.
