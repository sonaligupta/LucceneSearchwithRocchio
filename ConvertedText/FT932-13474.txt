FT  23 APR 93 / World Trade News: Airline losses continue


   By DANIEL GREEN


THE WORLD'S airlines lost money for the third consecutive year in 1992,
according to the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), a UN
agency, Daniel Green reports.
It said that operating revenues of scheduled airlines, excluding flights
within the Commonwealth of Independent States, rose to Dollars 212bn (Pounds
140.3bn) from Dollars 203.4bn in 1992. Operating expenses rose to Dollars
213bn from Dollars 204.4bn.
The 4.2 per cent growth in revenues was in line with an ICAO prediction a
year ago.
The ICAO's 1992 figures also indicate that pressure on profit margins
increased on the freight side, with revenues per tonne per kilometre falling
from Dollars 0.924 to Dollars 0.887 between 1991 and 1992.
Costs per tonne/kilometre fell from Dollars 0.93 cents to Dollars 0.893
cents.
Freight traffic more than halved on the busiest routes such as the north
Atlantic.
