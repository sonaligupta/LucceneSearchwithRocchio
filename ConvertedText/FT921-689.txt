FT  27 MAR 92 / Accident 'black box' for ships launched


AN accident 'black box' for ships was launched yesterday, but its
manufacturers fear that it may be some time before it is adopted worldwide.
The voyage event recorder provides a record of the last 24 hours of a
vessel's journey and should help marine investigators looking at the cause
of shipping accidents.
The device has already been installed by P&O in 10 of its ships and is said
to be more sophisticated than its equivalent in aircraft, the flight data
recorder.
The International Maritime Organisation, Department of Transport and Marine
Accidents Investigation Branch have been kept in touch with the development
of the device by Broadgate Ltd of Almondsbury, Avon. But Mr Chris Winkley,
managing director of Broadgate, said yesterday: 'I can't see the IMO making
the VER mandatory on all ships at the moment.'
Investigators of marine accidents at present have to depend on verbal
accounts of events leading to a shipping accident.
The new device has a tape which can play back the last 24 hours of a ship's
journey using voice recordings and radar screens, on which the vessel's
exact position can be plotted.
The device is housed in a 19-inch rack cabinet which incorporates all its
control electronics and system monitoring devices. It contains an
eight-track VHS recorder from Racal Recorders.
