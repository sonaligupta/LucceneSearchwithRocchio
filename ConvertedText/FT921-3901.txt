FT  12 MAR 92 / Letter: Schools conclusions should be drawn with care


   From Mr TOM BENYON


Sir, Whilst I congratulate your paper for compiling the FT Schools 500
tables (March 7/8), parents should draw conclusions from them with care.
My eldest daughter failed to get into two schools in your top 20, so we sent
her to Stowe, number 271. She graduated from Warwick University last year
with a 2:1.
My youngest daughter failed her 11-plus so she wouldn't have qualified for
entrance to any of the high-flying schools you list.
From Stowe, having gained entrance to Exeter University in the face of acute
competition, she is now well on her way to gaining combined honours in Drama
and English.
Academic success is relatively easy to come by if you manage to cream off
the brightest children and many of the best performing schools in your lists
do just that.
However, the real test of a school is to develop character and to encourage
average children to perform well. That cannot be measured in your guide.
Tom Benyon,
