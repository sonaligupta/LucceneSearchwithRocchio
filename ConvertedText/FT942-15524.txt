FT  14 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK spends Pounds 1m more on
animal inspections


   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES


The UK government has spent Pounds 1m to boost its on-farm inspections of
live animals imported to Britain after the dismantling of border controls as
part of the introduction of the European single market last year.
But still some diseases had succeeded in finding their way across the
channel, such as warble fly infestation and brucellosis in cattle, Mr Keith
Meldrum, the government's chief veterinary officer told the agriculture
select committee of MPs yesterday.
The import of live cattle to the UK has increased six-fold since the single
market came into effect at the beginning of last year. Half of these animals
have their documentation checked at the farm and 10 per cent receive blood
tests and other examinations.
Mr Meldrum said the Ministry of Agriculture was adding 30 man years' worth
of work to conduct on-farm checks of imported animals. Before the single
market came into effect, officials checked all animals at their port of
entry.
'There are not a large number of holes in the internal market arrangements.
We are now identifying those holes and blocking them up,' he said.
Mr Meldrum said the outbreak of brucellosis last November in Anglesey, which
was largely blamed by farmers on the single market, might still have
occurred under the previous arrangements. He estimated that outbreak had
cost farmers and Maff between Pounds 400,000 and Pounds 500,000 to stamp
out.
Warble fly infestation was introduced last year from France after the UK had
been free of the disease for two years. He said 1,500 herds of cattle had to
receive the complex treatment for the infestation.
