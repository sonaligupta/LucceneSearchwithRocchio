Malta's opposition Labour party will select today a new leader, after the
resignation of Mr Carmelo Mifsud Bonnici, Godfrey Grima writes from
Valletta. Mr Bonnici, party leader for seven years, selected a successor, Mr
George Vella, who declined to take over. Labour lost at the polls in
February to the Christian Democrats under Mr Eddie Fenech Adami. The new
contenders are Mr Joe Brincat, former justice minister Mr Lino Spiteri, a
former banker and Mr Alfred Sant, a Harvard-trained economist.
