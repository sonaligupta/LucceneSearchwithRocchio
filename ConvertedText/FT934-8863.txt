FT  13 NOV 93 / Protests mark Italian budget


   By REUTER


   ROME


Italy's Senate yesterday passed an austere 1994 budget as street protests
flared in Rome and the poor south of the country over cuts in welfare and
subsidies, Reuter reports from Rome. The budget now goes to the Chamber of
Deputies, where scandal-hit mainstream parties may try to delay approval in
an attempt to hold up elections, promised once the budget is passed.
