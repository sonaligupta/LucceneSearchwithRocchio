FT  15 JUN 93 / Rover agrees joint deal to make MGs


   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent


ROVER IS to re-enter the European sports car market with the launch of a
range of small MG sports cars in 1995.
It reached agreement yesterday on a joint production venture with Mayflower,
the specialist UK engineering company, which will invest in the MG
development programme and share the profits.
Code-named PR3, the new MG sports car is expected to be a mid-engined
roadster priced from about Pounds 15,000. Output is planned to reach 15,000
to 20,000 a year, and the range is expected to be sold in Japan.
The sports car will be powered at the top end of the range by Rover's
K-Series engine in a new 1.6-litre version, which is under development.
Rover, the vehicle subsidiary of British Aerospace, is seeking to resurrect
one of the world's best-known sports car marques more than a decade after MG
was killed off in 1980 by Sir Michael Edwardes, then British Leyland
chairman.
The new model is intended to return MG to the mainstream sports car market,
a segment dominated in recent years by Japanese manufacturers with products
such as the Mazda MX-5.
Rover has awarded the contract for the design, development and supply of the
sports car body shell to Mayflower's Coventry-based automotive engineering
subsidiary, Motor Panels. Mayflower is to invest up to Pounds 24.2m for the
initial engineering design, development and tooling work including the
necessary production facilities for the body shells.
It will produce the MG body panels and supply the welded bodies to Rover for
painting and final assembly.
The body shell production contract is expected to run for six years with a
sales value for Mayflower of about Pounds 20m a year.
Rover opened the way for the long-awaited revival of the MG marque last
autumn with the unveiling of the MG RV8, a redesigned and more powerful
variant of the MGB sports car, last produced in 1980.
The Pounds 26,500 MG RV8 was developed to mark the 30th anniversary of the
MGB, of which more than 500,000 were built. It is being produced at a
maximum volume of only 15 a week and was intended to resurrect the MG name
as a precursor to the resumption of volume sports car production with the
PR3 project.
In less than four years Rover has renewed most of its product range. This
started with the launch of the 200/400 series, the Land Rover Discovery and
a re-engineered Metro in 1989 and 1990, followed by a revamped Rover 800 in
1991 and the recent launch of the Rover 600 large family car.
Rover and Mayflower would not comment yesterday. Rover said: 'We do not
discuss future products or detailed commercial negotiations.'
