FT  22 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Light metals group to cut
output

ELKEM, THE Norwegian light metals producer, yesterday announced a
50,000-tonne cut in domestic ferro-silicon and ferrochrome production, which
would also lead to a reduction in its workforce.
The move comes as a result of a further deterioration in Elkem's main
markets, which Mr Ole Enger, the president, blamed on exports from eastern
Europe and China.
Elkem's annual domestic production capacity of ferro-silicon is 260,000
tonnes. Its worldwide capacity, which is at present 75 per cent utilised, is
450,000 tonnes.
Production at the group's lone ferrochrome plant, which is situated at Rana
in Norway and has annual production capacity of 140,000 tonnes, would be cut
by 26,000 tonnes, Elkem said. A 24,000-tonne cut would be made at the
Bjoelvefossen and Salten ferro-silicon plants.
'These actions show how serious the situation in our markets is,' Mr Enger
said. 'It is crucial that the power-intensive industries in Norway obtain
conditions that are as good as, or at least no worse than, other producers.'
