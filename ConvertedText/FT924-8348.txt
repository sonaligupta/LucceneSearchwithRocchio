FT  11 NOV 92 / International Company News: Arnotts rejects legal action


   By REUTER


   SYDNEY


ARNOTTS, the Australian bakery group, will not take legal action to prevent
Campbell Soup, the US foods group, from sending takeover documents to
Arnotts shareholders, but it believes the documents fail to make proper
dis-closures, Reuter reports from Sydney.
'We considered asking for an injunction to prevent the offers going out in
this unsatisfactory form, but we decided it was not in the interest of
shareholders to raise a barrier between Campbell and the offerees,' Arnotts
said.
Campbell, which owns 33 per cent of Arnotts, is offering ADollars 8.80 a
share for Arnotts, valuing the company at ADollars 1.23bn (USDollars 847m).
Arnotts' shares closed at ADollars 9.18 in Australia yesterday.
