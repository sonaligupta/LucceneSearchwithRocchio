FT  11 MAR 94 / International Company News: IBM gave chairman 'golden boot'
package


   By LOUISE KEHOE


International Business Machines gave a 'golden boot' to Mr John Akers, its
former chairman and chief executive, who retired last April under pressure
from the board of directors as a result of the company's worsening financial
performance.
According to a shareholders' proxy statement issued today, Mr Akers received
a severance package of about Dollars 3.4m. This included Dollars 2.5m,
equivalent to one year's compensation, as part of a retirement incentive
programme.
In addition, the former IBM chairman was awarded a Dollars 925,000 payment,
equivalent to his annual base salary 'in recognition of his 33 years of
service to the company'.
Other payments for 1994 totalled Dollars 433,333 in salary and bonus for the
four months that he remained with the company.
Yesterday, IBM also announced that it had laid off 800 workers in New York
state. The layoffs are part of a planned reduction of 30,000 jobs. IBM said
that it aimed to reduce its workforce to about 225,000, from 256,000 last
July.
