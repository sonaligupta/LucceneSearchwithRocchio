   VILNIUS


Lithuania's Chernobyl-type nuclear power station resumed partial output
yesterday almost a week after a leak in a narrow pipe forced it to close,
the head of the Baltic state's nuclear inspectorate said, Reuter reports
from Vilnius.
Povilas Vaisnys said that one of the closed reactor's two turbines had been
restarted and the other was expected to follow shortly after tests on the
emergency cooling system. Officials said no radiation escaped into the
environment.
