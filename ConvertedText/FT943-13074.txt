FT  21 JUL 94 / Major's Reshuffle: Senior party job goes to author


Mr Michael Dobbs, author of the television series and novel House of Cards,
was appointed a joint deputy party chairman.
Dubbed the 'second Jeffrey Archer' by friends, he recently said he sought
not the Booker Prize but to entertain in his writing.
Party managers hope he will bring a sense of excitement to his new job.
As a former chief of staff for Lord Tebbit when party chairman he also has
experience of the workings of Central Office.
Mr John Maples, a former financial secretary to the Treasury, is the other
new holder of the post.
Mr Maples was tipped for promotion to the cabinet before he lost his
Lewisham West seat at the last general election. He is currently chairman of
a government lobbying arm of Saatchi & Saatchi.
Dame Angela Rumbold remains the third deputy chairman.
Mr Graham Bright, dismissed as Mr Major's parliamentary private secretary in
favour of Mr John Ward, was knighted and appointed a vice chairman.
