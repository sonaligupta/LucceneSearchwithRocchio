FT  16 NOV 93 / International Company News: S&P puts Walt Disney under
review


   By TRACY CORRIGAN


STANDARD & Poor's, the US rating agency, has placed Walt Disney, the US
entertainment group which owns 49 per cent of the troubled EuroDisneyland,
on CreditWatch with negative implications. Disney's Dollars 1.2bn of
long-term debt is currently rated AA-, writes Tracy Corrigan.
Moody's, the other leading US rating agency, put Disney's debt under review
for possible downgrade last week, following EuroDisneyland's announcement of
a FFr5.3bn loss in its first year of operation.
S&P cited the potential for a more extended period of negative cash flow and
possible pressures on Disney to provide increased financial support to
EuroDisneyland in debt restructuring negotiations with its bank group.
However, Disney's own operations have continued to perform in line with
expectations, with 'good momentum in operating cash flow', S&P noted.
Any change in rating will depend on the final outcome of renegotiations with
banks and the degree of further business and financial support Disney may
agree to provide. S&P added that it does not expect the senior debt rating
to fall below A+.
