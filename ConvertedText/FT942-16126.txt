FT  12 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Water


The 15 per cent fall in the water sector this year owes more to rising bond
yields than to increasing regulatory risks. The yield gap between
index-linked gilts and water shares has remained remarkably constant since
the turn of the year at around 1.6 percentage points. The risk premium for
holding water shares is thus unchanged.
True, this aggregate performance hides a narrowing of odds ahead of this
summer's review of price limits by Ofwat, the industry regulator. Laggards
such as Yorkshire have tended to perform better than traditional favourites
such as Severn Trent. If trading volumes remain thin there could be some
uncomfortably sharp corrections. Last week's 5 per cent fall in the sector,
despite relative calm elsewhere in the equity market and in index-linked
gilts, is a case in point.
With few announcements likely in the run up to the review, though, the
sector will probably continue to track bond yields. Whether water shares
decouple from bonds thereafter depends on the outlook for dividend growth
once the new price limits are known. Until then a prospective yield
approaching 6 per cent, based on estimates of dividend growth this year, is
a tempting carrot. That should limit the downside, even if index-linked gilt
yields rise from here. The worry is that Ofwat has yet to wield its stick.
