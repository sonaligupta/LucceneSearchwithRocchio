FT  28 JUL 92 / Observer: Fall from grace


Have you noticed how the pecking order in British banking has been reversed?
A year ago Barclays Bank was capitalised at Pounds 7.4bn on the stock
market, towering above the rest of the Big Four clearing banks. Its position
as one of the world's biggest and strongest banks was underscored by its
triple-A credit rating.
Now it is the smallest in terms of its stock market capitalisation at under
Pounds 5bn. Its value has fallen by a third over the past year.
The Hongkong Bank's takeover of Midland Bank has distorted the rankings, but
even so Lloyds Bank, whose balance sheet is less than half Barclays' size,
has leapfrogged it, and is now running neck and neck with NatWest, which
used to be Britain's biggest bank before it was knocked off its perch by an
aggressive Barclays.
For an institution that is two years older than the Bank of England and
prides itself on traditions of integrity and prudence inherited from its
Quaker founders, Barclays' recent fall from grace is a rather sad state of
affairs.
No doubt it will bounce back.
