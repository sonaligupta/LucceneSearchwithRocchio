FT  28 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Poll paralysis hits shares


Were it not for the election, equities might be discounting a modest
recovery. The latest Confederation of British Industry survey suggests a
slight improvement in manufacturers' order books. Companies like Booker and
United Newspapers have muttered vaguely positive things about current
trading when reporting their results. The trade figures revealed buoyant
imports of capital goods. But it makes no sense for equities to take this on
board before the election.
The conventional wisdom is that ERM membership means the UK's long-term
economic prospects will be little different whoever wins. However, the
short-run ride could be rough if a Tory defeat forced an interest rate rise.
The impact on consumer confidence of higher mortgage rates would defer the
recovery, probably until 1993. Meanwhile government borrowing would soar.
One temptation for Mr John Smith might be devaluation, but, to keep
inflation down, that would need an accompanying squeeze on government
spending. Amid the uncertainty the equity market is inevitably inclined to
head lower. One consolation is that the more a Tory defeat is discounted in
advance, the less of a shock there will be if it happens. Another is that
stocks with large US exposure like RTZ and Siebe still seem able to ride out
the storm.
