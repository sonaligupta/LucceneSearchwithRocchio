FT  29 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Profits warning hits Gas


   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and PETER JOHN


A profits warning from British Gas chairman Mr Richard Giordano at the
group's annual meeting, and a growing worry among fund managers that a
dividend cut could be on the horizon, saw Gas shares tumble in exceptionally
heavy trading. Mr Giordano said first quarter profits were the same as the
comparable period, but warned that profits for the rest of the year would
not match those of last year.
Trading at 300p before the meeting, the shares subsequently dropped to close
a net 15 off at 280p. Turnover of 26m was the highest single-day's business
since last August when the Monopolies and Mergers Commission released its
report on the gas industry.
Some analysts questioned whether Mr Giordano's comments were designed to win
sympathy from the government as it assembles the ground rules for
competition in the domestic gas sector.
However, Mr Steve Turner of Nomura, one of the more bearish analysts on Gas,
said: 'The dividend is not under threat; earnings will move ahead in 1995 as
a result of Gas's cost cutting efforts.
But Mr Chris Perry at Charterhouse Tilney maintained his deeply bearish view
of Gas; 'To achieve dividend cover of two times, Gas needs annual earnings
growth of 40 per cent; the shares are a sell down to at least 250p.'
