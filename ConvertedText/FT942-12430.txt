FT  29 APR 94 / UK Company News: Industrial logic that's very compelling -
How the Enterprise Oil chairman sees the future with the prospect of Lasmo
in the pipeline


   By DAVID LASCELLES


'This is a big boys' game', said Mr Graham Hearne, chairman and chief
executive of Enterprise Oil, yesterday.
It is a message he will have to press home hard, judging by the generally
sceptical reaction in the City to his Pounds 1.4bn bid for fellow
independent oil company Lasmo. But there are several points to his game
plan.
As his opening remark suggests, Mr Hearne is looking for size and strength.
In an environment where low oil prices are exposing the weaknesses in the
oil industry, he believes that a company needs 'clout and credibility' if it
is to succeed.
The combination of Enterprise and Lasmo, two medium-sized exploration and
production companies, will have 'critical mass' he says, as well as the
financial and technical strength needed to operate on a world scale. The
deal would virtually double Enterprise's reserves and production.
But having said that, Mr Hearne is also keen to dismiss the idea that he is
after size for its own sake. 'This is not megalomania. I feel very
passionately about this,' he said. And though a successful bid would greatly
enlarge Enterprise, it would still be small relative to the oil 'majors' -
about one tenth the market capitalisation of Shell, for example. So there
was no question of stifling Enterprise's flair but of creating more
opportunities to put it to work.
Mr Andrew Shilston, finance director, said: 'We aim to create further value,
not just add the two companies together.'
Although both companies are strong in the North Sea, their operations have
relatively little overlap elsewhere, and cover all the continents.
The financial match is also good, Mr Hearne says. Lasmo is strapped for cash
whereas Enterprise has completed the bulk of its Pounds 1.3bn capital
spending programme and is about to reap the benefits in swelling cash flow.
By merging Enterprise's strong balance sheet with Lasmo's, he expects to end
up with a gearing of 44 per cent. This is lower than Enterprise's existing
gearing of 48 per cent because it will include the proceeds of Lasmo's
current Pounds 219m rights issue.
'We have the cash and they have the exploration prospects,' he said. 'The
industrial logic is very compelling'.
Above all, Mr Hearne believes that Enterprise can make more of Lasmo's oil
and gas assets than Lasmo itself, though he was unwilling to come up with
any specific examples yesterday - or point fingers at particular members of
Lasmo management, though he says it suffers from 'continuing weakness'
despite a reshuffle at the top.
However, some market sceptics point out that Enterprise's own recent record
has not been that brilliant, despite its stronger market standing compared
to Lasmo. Its earnings per share are down from late 1980 levels, and its
exploration record has tailed off even though capital spending has gone up.
In particular, the market is worried that Enterprise is about to make the
same mistake as Lasmo when it paid Pounds 1bn for Ultramar in 1991 in a bid
for expansion, only to plunge into loss. Mr Hearne points to several
differences.
One is that his bid will be paid for with shares rather than topped up with
cash, leaving the balance sheet in good shape. 'It is our policy to fund big
deals with paper,' he says.
A second is that, unlike Ultramar, Lasmo is not in the hard-pressed refining
business. Another is that Enterprise is not planning on a 'fire sale' of
Lasmo assets to finance the deal, as was the case with Ultramar. And lastly,
Mr Hearne believes that his offer has been pitched at a realistic level
given the unexciting outlook for the oil price. 'It's wrong to suppose that
if you invest, the oil price will bail you out.'
Mr Hearne says 'I honestly do not know' when asked what might happen to the
oil price. But he says the offer has been examined in the light of a whole
range of assumptions from Pounds 9 to Pounds 12 a barrel.
