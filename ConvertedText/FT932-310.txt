FT  29 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Rank deal doubted


   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY


SUGGESTIONS IN the UK press that Rank Organisation was closer to selling its
stake in Rank Xerox brought a mostly sceptical response from leisure
analysts, although the shares reacted more favourably, gaining 16 to 796p.
Turnover was a healthy 1.5m.
The advance was helped by more speculative comment that if Rank were to sell
the Xerox stake, and also accept a long-rumoured offer for its film
division, then the company could be ripe for break-up. Some also suggested
that the Xerox stake sale, which could raise in the region of Pounds 1.5bn
and virtually wipe out the Rank group's debt, might also become a bargaining
tool in eliciting a higher price for the film division. Although Rank has
denied being interested in selling, analysts have put a figure of Pounds
400m on the film division.
However, more seasoned hands were dismissive of these suggestions and said
it would be some time, perhaps years, before Xerox would be in a position to
buy Rank's share. A spokesman for Rank declined to comment on the
speculation.
