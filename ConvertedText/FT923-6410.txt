FT  25 AUG 92 / Water regulator to tighten rules


   By NEIL BUCKLEY


MR IAN BYATT, director-general of water industry regulator Ofwat, yesterday
acted to ensure that water companies could not use funds from their core
businesses to subsidise their other activities.
Using new powers available to him after publication of the Competition and
Services (Utilities) Act in July, Mr Byatt published proposed amendments to
water companies' operating licences designed to give him greater control
over their non-regulated businesses.
Water companies have diversified since they were privatised in 1989 into
fields including environmental and engineering services, waste management,
and even hotel management to try to maximise earnings from businesses not
regulated by Ofwat.
In spite of water companies' denials, Ofwat says there is 'anecdotal
evidence' of some cross-subsidisation.
The proposals include a ban on cross-subsidies between water companies and
their associated companies, or between their water businesses and any other
businesses.
Water companies would also be prohibited from allowing an associated company
to supply any service that the core company might itself supply as part of
its regulated water business, on more or less favourable terms than those
available from the core company.
It would be compulsory for water companies to give Ofwat full details of any
transactions between themselves and associated companies of more than 0.5
per cent of their water business turnover, or Pounds 100,000.
Companies have until October 2 to respond.
The Water Services Association, which represents the 10 privatised water and
sewage companies, said the proposals would not cause concern.
