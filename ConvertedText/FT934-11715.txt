FT  29 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: China awards more offshore oil
contracts


   By Our Beijing Staff


CHINA HAS opened further its offshore areas to foreign investors. China
National Offshore Oil Corporation this week signed contracts with Texaco,
Agip of Italy and Maersk of Denmark jointly to explore three blocs in the
East China Sea.
In a competitive bidding with 14 other foreign bidders from Britain, Japan,
the Netherlands and South Korea, the three companies secured Chinese
approval to explore about 8,100 square kilometres, some 400km south-east of
Shanghai.
Under the contract, signed in the presence of Chinese vice-premier Zou
Jiahua, Texaco will hold a 40 per cent interest and Agip and Maersk 30 per
cent each in the exploration area.
Exploration costs in the first 3 years are estimated to exceed USDollars
100m. The region is regarded as highly prospective.
China opened its continental shelf to foreign bidders in 1982, the year the
offshore oil corporation was established, to attract what it needs most -
finance, technological know-how and modern management. It has now signed 79
contracts with 51 oil companies from 14 countries.
China's offshore oil output this year is expected to reach 4.5m tonnes and
onshore, 138m tonnes. The corporation's target is to increase its output to
12m tonnes by 1997.
'Although China's offshore oil production only amounts to a small percentage
of the country's total output now,' said Chen Bingqian, vice-president of
the corporation, 'we are growing much faster than the onshore sector.'
On present trends China is likely to become a net importer of oil by 1995,
and this has spurred efforts to secure foreign investment in the exploration
of offshore and onshore areas such as the Tarim basin in the country's
far-western Xinjiang region.
