BANGKOK Transit System Corporation, which has a 30-year concession to build
and run an Dollars 880m (Pounds 619.70m) elevated railway for Thailand's
heavily congested capital city, yesterday short-listed five international
consortiums and invited them to bid for construction work and supply of the
complete rail system.
BTSC, a subsidiary of the Tanayong property group, said it had rejected
approaches from six more consortiums.
The five chosen applicants are expected to submit tenders for the whole
project on a turnkey basis by June 30.
Construction should start in the third quarter of this year.
Bidders will have to submit financing proposals as part of the tender.
'Based on discussions with intended bidders and export credit agencies, it
would appear that supplier and export credits on favourable terms, for up to
85 per cent of contract values, could be available,' Salomon Brothers, one
of BTSC's financial advisors, said in a statement.
BTSC said the five consortiums invited to bid for the project are:
Siemens and Christiani and Nielsen; GEC Alsthom, Italian-Thai Development
and Bouygues; Mitsui, Sumitomo, GTM, Siam Syntech and Delta Engineering;
Itochu, AEG Westinghouse, Sumitomo Construction, Nishimatsu and Maeda; and
ABB Traction, Costain, Kier, Konoike and Thai Konoike.
