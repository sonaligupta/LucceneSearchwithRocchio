FT  23 NOV 92 / International Company News: Aegon reports 6.3% increase to
Fl 235m

AEGON, the Dutch insurance group, reported a 6.3 per cent increase in
third-quarter net profits and a 9.4 per cent rise for the first nine months
of the year.
Net profits - which consist of operating profits and realised profits on
investments - totalled Fl 235m (Dollars 130.5m) in the third quarter,
against Fl 221m a year earlier, helping to lift nine-month results to Fl
698m from Fl 638m.
Aegon, whose main business is life insurance, described the results as very
satisfactory, given the difficult conditions in insurance markets.
Operating profits in the first nine months were up by 9.7 per cent at Fl
571.3m, while after-tax profits on investments rose by 7.9 per cent to Fl
127.0m.
Aegon repeated earlier forecasts that operating profits would show a clear
rise in 1992 as a whole.
The number of outstanding shares is also expected to increase markedly
because of stock dividends, options and a 1991 convertible bond issue,
leading Aegon to predict that operating profits per share would at least
match the 1991 result.
