FT  08 JUN 92 / World News in Brief: Policeman's murder linked to London
bombing


Police last night appeared to be linking the murder of a Yorkshire policeman
with a suspected IRA bomb at London's Festival Hall. A manhunt started near
Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, after special constable Glenn Goodman, 37, and
PC Alexander Kelly, 32, were shot with a semi-automatic rifle when they
stopped a car in a routine check. Glenn Goodman died later in hospital and
PC Kelly was seriously injured. The red Ford Sierra eluded a police chase
and was found burning in a field.
The shooting came only three hours after a small bomb had gone off outside
the Festival Hall. It caused little damage and no casualties.
