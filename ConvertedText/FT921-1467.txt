FT  24 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Weak bonds weigh on
continental bourses


   By Our Markets Staff


WEAK bond markets pushed most bourses lower yesterday, writes Our Markets
Staff.
FRANKFURT more than wiped out Friday's 11-point gain, which had been
generated by the 'quadruple witching hour' expiry of options and futures.
Attention returned to more worrying aspects, such as cautious statements
from the corporate sector and rising bond yields, which approached 8.10 per
cent at the long end yesterday.
The DAX index ended 18.83 lower at 1,717.47 while the FAZ index, calculated
at midsession, fell 5.31 to 699.13. Turnover fell to DM5.7bn from Friday's
inflated DM15.7bn.
Most blue chips were lower, though BMW stood out with a DM1.10 gain to
DM561.90, supported by last week's good results. In steels, Thyssen fell
DM14.20 to DM218.90 following its chairman's warning that profits this year
would be 'markedly lower' than last year.
Brokers are divided about Thyssen: County NatWest expects a 30 per cent fall
in Thyssen's first half results and is worried by the lack of a dividend
guarantee for the current year from the chairman. James Capel, however, says
the shares are good for a recovery, since it thinks the company will be a
major beneficiary of higher prices for flat steel products.
PARIS fell through the 1,900 support level, pressured by a weaker bond
market and the results of the regional elections. Trading was dominated by
arbitrage activity, with institutions opting to stay away. This was
reflected in the day's moderate turnover of FFr2.4bn, as the CAC-40 index
closed down 34.55 or 1.8 per cent to 1,884.57.
Total fell FFr7.70 or 3.4 per cent to FFr222.40 following a wire agency
report on Friday that the company's Colombian oil find might be smaller than
expected. The company declined to comment, though dealers expect a
clarification at Total's analysts' meeting in two weeks' time.
Yesterday's suspension of Perrier and Exor came as no surprise, and
speculation spilled over from last week that the Agnellis and Nestle had
carved up the mineral water company behind closed doors. There was also talk
that Nestle had lifted its bid for Perrier to FFr1,600 from FFr1,475.
Minority shareholders were still in the dark yesterday, though all should be
revealed at Nestle's news conference today.
MILAN remained on the sidelines ahead of the general election in April, and
corporate results scheduled this week are not expected to provide much
direction. The Comit index fell 1.26 to 510.61 in turnover estimated at
close to Friday's L68bn.
Friday's news that Total of France was interested in buying some of
Pirelli's diversified activities lifted the stock by L2 to L1,265, before
rising to L1,286 after hours. Olivetti rose L7 to L2,919 ahead of news that
it had broadened its collaboration with Canon of Japan.
Shares in the Agnelli group rose on hopes of an amicable settlement with
Nestle over Perrier, with Fiat adding L4 to L4,849. Ifi fell L120 to L12,370
but reached L12,850 later.
In telecoms, Sirti eased L15 to L10,740 on rumours of a scrip issue.
AMSTERDAM weakened in dull trading as the CBS Tendency Index closed 0.8
lower at 125.0 in turnover of FL 401.6m. The crash in the US of a Fokker
aircraft sent the shares down to close Fl 1.00 lower or 3 per cent at Fl
33.40. Elsevier weakened 20 cents to Fl 114.30 following Friday's results
which were in line with expectations. Nedlloyd advanced Fl 1.00 or 1.7 per
cent to Fl 59.00 having been under pressure last week after a
debt-for-equity swap was announced.
ZURICH closed slightly off the day's lows with rising money market rates and
a weak bond market keeping activity down. The SMI index fell 18.9 to
1,818.2.
Banks and insurers lost ground: CS Holding bearers fell SFr10 to SFr1,960
and UBS bearers shed SFr30 to SFr3,750. George Fischer bearers closed down
SFr15 at SFr1,020 ahead of reporting a dividend cut.
STOCKHOLM declined on profit-taking. The Affarsvarlden General Index ended
down 8.1 at 1,001.6 in turnover of SKr594m, down from SKr830m. Volvo B
closed up SKr1 at SKr412. Reports that Mr Soeren Gyll, chief executive of
Procordia, was to replace Mr Christer Zetterberg as Volvo chief came after
the close.
MADRID closed with the general index shedding 2.19 to 256.19.
