FT  15 APR 94 / Call for probe of MP losses at Lloyd's


   By KEVIN BROWN


Mr Peter Hain, the Labour MP for Neath, yesterday called for an inquiry into
allegations that Conservative MPs facing losses at Lloyd's have been
assisted by payments from special funds.
Mr Hain, who has tabled three parliamentary motions on Lloyd's in recent
weeks, told the Commons that 51 Conservative MPs who are Names face
aggregate losses of Pounds 22m.
Mrs Betty Boothroyd, the speaker, blocked a further early day motion on the
grounds that the procedure was being wrongly used to 'campaign' against the
MPs involved.
However, Mr Hain told MPs at question time that the prime minister should
set up an inquiry to establish whether Conservative MPs are being protected
by:
'Retrospective stop-loss policies which they have knowingly or unknowingly
been allocated (to) by their agents, and which are not available to other
Lloyd's Names;
'Their losses being financed from Lloyd's central funds whilst they are not
responsible for payment like other Lloyd's Names;
'Their losses being paid by their members' agency . . . especially bearing
in mind that other external Names face destitution whilst Tory MPs with
similar average lines in lossmaking syndicates miraculously have not.'
Mr Hain's campaign has been strongly criticised by some Conservative MPs.
