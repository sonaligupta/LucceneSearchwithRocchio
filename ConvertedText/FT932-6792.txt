FT  27 MAY 93 / Durable goods orders flat in US


   By REUTER


   WASHINGTON


US durable goods orders were flat in April, the Commerce Department said
yesterday, and order backlogs shrank to the lowest level in 4 1/2 years as
manufacturing business contracted, Reuter reports from Washington.
The unchanged orders total last month followed a revised drop of 3.7 per
cent in March, previously reported as 3.4 per cent. The figure was much
weaker than expected by Wall Street economists, who had forecast a 1.4 per
cent rise in orders.
April orders had been expected to rebound from March, when severe weather
hampered production in a number of industries. But the Commerce Department
report showed not only unchanged order volume but also fewer shipments of
finished products.
Total new orders in April were worth Dollars 130.3bn (Pounds 84.6bn).
Orders for defence goods, which experience wide monthly swings, rose by 2.9
per cent last month after 8.9 per cent in March. If defence is excluded,
overall orders in April fell by 0.1 per cent after decreasing by 4.3 per
cent in March.
'I found it to be a mildly disappointing report,' said Mr Dana Johnson,
vice-president and economist at First National Bank of Chicago.
