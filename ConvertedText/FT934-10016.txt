FT  08 NOV 93 / People: Union Bank of Switzerland


Union Bank of Switzerland has appointed a lawyer to head its European
securitisation group; the shift from lawyer to banker is common on Wall
Street, but is still seen as rather unusual in the City. David Bonsall, 37,
joins from Freshfields, the City law firm, where he was a partner and head
of the capital markets and securitisation group.
Bonsall (above right), a Cambridge golfing blue, has been involved in the
securitisation market since its inception in Europe. In 1986, he advised
Salomon Brothers on the setting up of The Mortgage Corporation, the
specialist mortgage lender which kick-started the sterling mortgage-backed
securities market.
These complex deals, which allow companies to remove assets from their
balance sheets, are characterised by their long and painful gestation - and
the high legal fees involved.
Bonsall is already well acquainted with the frustrations of the market,
having thought up a number of innovations which failed to come to fruition,
as well as some that did, such as bonds backed by mortgages in arrears.
Bonsall will be a managing director of UBS in London, and will spearhead the
bank's European securitisation efforts following the departure of Euan Lynes
and Bruce Gaitskell, who were responsible for different areas of the
asset-backed market.
