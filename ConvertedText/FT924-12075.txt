FT  22 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Banco Santander raises profits and dividend


   By TOM BURNS


   MADRID


BANCO SANTANDER, the Spanish banking group, raised third-quarter net income
by 13.8 per cent to Pta62bn (Dollars 626.5m) in the first nine months of the
year and will lift its interim dividend by 10 per cent to Pta143 per share.
The profit growth was in part due to a 29.5 per cent rise to Pta52.6bn in
other ordinary revenue, chiefly fee income, which compensated for a 4 per
cent fall to Pta485.6bn in financial revenues.
Santander was also able to reduce its financial costs by 6.5 per cent to
Pta337bn and contained the growth of total operating expenses to 4.9 per
cent.
In the breakdown of its Pta109.9bn total operating expenses, Santander
increased its personnel expenses by 7.2 per cent to Pta71.8bn but kept
overheads and taxes other than income tax virtually unchanged at Pta38.1bn.
Mr Emilio Botin, chairman, said the economic downturn and reduced demand for
loans had slowed growth.
