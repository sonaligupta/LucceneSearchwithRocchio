FT  12 MAR 93 / International Company News: Coles Myer climbs 4% despite
tough conditions

COLES MYER, Australia's biggest retailer, has posted a modest increase in
first-half earnings despite depressed consumer spending and intense price
competition.
The directors yesterday announced a 4 per cent rise in net profits to
ADollars 236.6m (USDollars 167m) in the 26 weeks to January 24 from ADollars
227.4m a year earlier, despite a 1 per cent slide in sales to ADollars 7.9bn
from ADollars 8.0bn.
The company is raising its interim dividend by 17.9 per cent with 11 cents a
share on capital increased by a bonus issue in 1992. The previous interim
dividend was 21 cents a share on lower capital.
Mr Solomon Lew, chairman, said the result showed that the company continued
to weather the recession better than most retailers.
He pointed out that, adjusting for the sale of the company's interests in
Sandhurst Farms and Progressive Enterprises in New Zealand, pre-tax profits
rose 9.5 per cent and sales were 4.2 per cent ahead.
He said the company had reduced net debt in the period by 87.5 per cent to
ADollars 116m. This helped to reduce the company's net interest bill by more
than half from ADollars 51.4m to ADollars 24.8m. Cash flow rose 16 per cent
to ADollars 593.2m.
'We are positioned to take immediate advantage of economic improvement and
we have the financial strength to continue to invest in our own business and
in new development opportunities,' Mr Lew said.
Mr Peter Bartels, chief executive officer, said the highlight of the result
was a rise in pre-tax profits of the K mart division to ADollars 78.8m from
ADollars 43.2m. However, strong competition had hit food sales despite a
solid sales rise, he said.
