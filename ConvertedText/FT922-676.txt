FT  26 JUN 92 / International Company News: Handelsbanken in US bond issue


   By ROBERT TAYLOR


   STOCKHOLM


SVENSKA Handelsbanken, one of Sweden's leading commercial banks, has
negotiated a Dollars 400m 12-year subordinated bond issue on the US money
market which is designed to strengthen its capital base, writes Robert
Taylor in Stockholm.
The bond issue was placed through the investment bank Merrill Lynch along
with Lehman Brothers and Morgan Stanley.
Mr Arne Martensson, chief executive at Handelsbanken said this was the first
time that the bank had negotiated a single bond issue in the American market
but this reflected the favourable international view of Handelsbanken's
financial strength.
Although hit by credit losses like the rest of Sweden's commercial banks,
Handelsbanken remains in a much stronger position than its competitors.
Operating profits for the first four months were SKr664m.
