FT  06 JAN 94 / International Company News: VNU expects to beat forecast
with 12% rise

VNU, one of the Netherlands' top three publishing groups, expects to report
a 12 per cent increase in 1993 net profit before extraordinary items,
slightly better than its earlier forecast of 10 per cent growth.
In 1992 VNU reported net profit of Fl 128m (Dollars 66m) on normal
activities before taking an extraordinary charge of Fl 80m to cover the sale
of its printing operation in early 1993.
In August VNU had predicted a 10 per cent rise in 1993 net profit, in line
with results for the first half of the year.
Mr Joep Brentjens, chairman, described the performance as satisfying because
the company had raised profits and margins in spite of the unfavourable
economic climate. Final figures for 1993 will be released in the spring.
VNU said yesterday it posted substantially better results in consumer
magazines in the Netherlands; business magazine operations, which span six
European countries; business information services in the US; educational
publishing; and commercial television in Belgium and the Netherlands.
Robeco, the Dutch-based investment fund manager, said assets under
management rose by 42 per cent to a record Fl 65.8bn (Dollars 34bn) in 1993
from Fl 46.4bn in 1992.
The surge was due to an increase in the value of assets, reflecting buoyant
capital markets, and a 25 per cent rise in client base to 600,000 investors.
Robeco's strategic partnership with Rabobank, the Dutch co - operative bank,
yielded around Fl 5bn in new funds from investors seeking to compensate for
the decline in interest paid on savings accounts.
Robeco said all its investment funds showed 'excellent' results last year.
The group's flagship Robeco equity fund, which invests in shares around the
world, achieved a performance of 30.0 per cent in 1993, compared with 9.6
per cent in 1992.
