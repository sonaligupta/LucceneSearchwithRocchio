FT  01 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Colorgraphic shares suspended at 25p


   By ANDREW BOLGER


SHARES IN Colorgraphic, the advertising and direct mail literature group,
were suspended at 25p yesterday pending clarification of its financial
position, writes Andrew Bolger.
Colorgraphic, which has been hit hard by the advertising recession, also
announced that Mr Nick Winks had been relieved of his duties as chief
executive and deputy chairman. Mr Alan MacLeod has resigned from the board.
An adviser said the suspension and board changes followed the breaching of a
banking covenant by the group, which had found its trading conditions
continuing to deteriorate.
A further statement would be made as soon as talks with its bankers had
ended.
Mr Ron Welch, founder and executive chairman of Colorgraphic, has resumed
the role of chief executive.
At yesterday's suspension price, Colorgraphic has a market value of Pounds
4.24m, compared with a peak of Pounds 33.2m in 1989.
In March, the company reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.33m in the year to
December 31, against a profit of Pounds 2.01m.
