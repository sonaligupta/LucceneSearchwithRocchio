FT  04 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Weakness in financials mars
bourse recovery


   By Our Markets Staff


Yesterday's recovery from earlier falls was marred by weakness in some
financials, following rumoured repercussions among American banks to the
recent slide in bonds, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT chose to follow the US markets in the morning, after overnight
gains on Wall Street, and to ignore them in the afternoon when the Dow and
the US long bond both fell. The DAX index closed the session 17.57 higher at
2,037.90, and hit an Ibis-indicated 2,044.45 at the end of the day.
Turnover rose from DM8.2bn to DM9.5bn. Banks were relatively weak. Mr Nigel
Longley of Commerzbank said that this reflected stories of serious trading
losses in derivatives by US banks, rather than the Bundesbank's decision to
hold key interest rates.
There were pockets of strength among carmakers and chemicals on cyclical
recovery prospects, BMW rising DM15 to DM840, and then to DM844 after hours,
chemicals also responding to the prospect of their dividend announcements
next week.
Steels, after hours, seemed unmoved by the IG Metall decision to take 10,000
workers out on strike in Lower Saxony next Monday; there were hopes that a
compromise with engineering industry employers could still be reached.
Thyssen celebrated the Tranrapid go-ahead with a DM5.50 rise to DM257.50 on
the session; and Preussag ended the afternoon at DM470, after a morning rise
of DM5.70 to DM466.70.
PARIS saw a calmer day, after the excitement of Wednesday, with the CAC-40
index drifting 9.75 higher to 2,154.41, turnover retreating to a more
average FFr4bn after FFr8bn the day before.
Moulinex, the household electricals company, was the most active issue
following a broker's upgrade. It was suspended briefly limit-up in early
trading, before ending the session up FFr13.10 or nearly 10 per cent at
FFr149. The shares have gained 44 per cent over the year so far.
Peugeot was also strong on the day, up FFr23 to FFr866: the car manufacturer
said that it expected a return to profitability in 1994. Michelin gained
FFr5.20 to FFr250.00.
The financial sector weakened: SocGen lost FFr14 or 2 per cent to FFr682,
BNP FFr4.70 to FFr258.50 and UAP FFr6.40 or 3.4 per cent to FFr180.30.
AMSTERDAM returned to fundamentals as both Philips, the electronics group,
and DSM, in chemicals, pleased the market with good 1993 results and
dividend payments at the top end of expectations.
The AEX index gained 5.14 or 1.3 per cent to 412.41.
The 50 cents payout from Philips was its first since 1989, giving the shares
an early boost, while analysts were also encouraged by the Fl 2bn net 1993
profit which followed a loss of Fl 900m in 1992. The shares added Fl 4.00 to
Fl 46.00, bringing gains to the year so far to 11 per cent.
Polygram rose Fl 2.90 to FL 79.80.
The only disappointing division was at Grundig of Germany, in which it holds
a 31 per cent stake. Mr Jan Timmer, the chairman of Philips, said that job
cuts here would be necessary.
DSM paid Fl 1.50, forecast a profit in the first quarter of 1994 and
reported a 1993 loss of some Fl 60m before extraordinary items. The shares
rose Fl 4.10 to Fl 111.70.
MILAN saw a technical bounce after Wednesday's losses and the Comit index
picked up 10.33 or 1.6 per cent to 649.68.
BCI rose L93 to L6,110 amid reports that the privatisation, which closed
three days early, was nine times oversubscribed.
The enthusiasm spilled over to the rest of the sector with Banca di Roma L65
or 3.4 per cent higher at L1,957 and Credito Italiano L62 or 2.4 per cent
ahead at L2,670.
IMI, the medium term credit group, rose L143 to L12,812 on higher parent
company operating profits.
Some of the recently underperforming insurers had a better day. Alleanza
added L286 or 1.9 per cent to L15,594 and RAS L357 or 1.4 per cent to
L25,152.
Olivetti gained L50 or 2.2 per cent to L2,340, supported by speculation that
it could win a second mobile telephone system operating licence.
ZURICH rebounded 1.3 per cent after five straight days of losses and the SMI
index added 34.9 to 2,803.4.
The banking sector remained at the centre of attention. UBS bearers,
encountering further foreign selling, fell SFr14 to SFr1,248. CS Holding
added SFr20 to SFr636 as the market awaited today's results from Credit
Suisse, and SBC added SFr1 to SFr445: both continue to benefit from
recommendations of a switch out of UBS.
SMH put on SFr17 to SFr920: the watchmaker and Mercedes are to present a
working prototype of the Swatchmobile small car in Stuttgart today.
MADRID's banks were mixed in spite of a surprise half-point cut in the Bank
of Spain's benchmark interest rate to 8 per cent. However, the broad market
rose, the general index closing 4.65 up at 329.81.
Telefonica recovered Pta70 to Pta1,905 as analysts decided that the company
had been punished too heavily for the price of its Peruvian acquisitions.
HELSINKI picked up 2 per cent after declines earlier in the week, the Hex
index rising 36.1 to 1,876.3. Foreign demand helped Nokia FM43 higher to
FM375 in continued response to Tuesday's results.
Merrill Lynch joined the growing band of enthusiasts for the market,
forecasting that it could be among the best performers over the next 12
months. The US house said that a stronger than expected global economic
recovery would be positive, given that the market was the most cyclical in
Europe; the impact of currency depreciation on earnings growth had been
underestimated; valuations were among the most attractive in Europe; and
growth in the domestic economy could easily be three times consensus over
the next two years.
