FT  27 SEP 94 / International Company News: Court allows ousting of Wallace
McCain


   By BERNARD SIMON


A New Brunswick court has allowed one faction of Canada's feuding McCain
family, which controls the McCain frozen food and beverage empire, to oust
Mr Wallace McCain as the group's president and joint chief executive.
The court decision follows three years of wrangling between Mr McCain and
his brother Harrison over who should succeed them as McCain Foods' chief
executive officer, and over the future direction of the multinational
company.
McCain Foods has 68 plants in North America, Europe and Australasia. It
reported sales of CDollars 2.7bn (USDollars 2.0bn) last year.
The two brothers, who are both in their mid-60s, founded the company 38
years ago. Their relationship, however, has been marked by lawsuits and
public insults since Wallace angered Harrison by tipping one of his sons as
the group's next chief executive.
A majority of McCain family shareholders decided earlier this month to give
Wallace the title of deputy chairman. Harrison would remain sole chief
executive until an outsider was recruited.
Wallace, who owns some one-third of McCain Foods' shares, sought an
injunction to prevent the decision being carried out.
However, Mr Justice Creaghan said that 'while it is true that Wallace McCain
has made a significant if not essential contribution to the success of the
company in the past, that is not to say that the company cannot successfully
operate in the present without guidance from (him) acting as a co-CEO.'
Wallace McCain has launched a separate lawsuit which seeks to have McCain
Foods and its holding company restructured. The restructuring would include
a public offering of about 20 per cent of the McCain family's shares. But
this proposal has so far been rejected by Harrison McCain and other family
members, mainly the children of two other brothers who died.
