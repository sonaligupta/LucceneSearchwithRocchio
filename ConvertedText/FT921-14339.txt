FT  16 JAN 92 / Lucas unit wins Toyota wiring order


   By JOHN GRIFFITHS


A JOINT venture between Lucas Industries and Sumitomo of Japan has been
awarded a Pounds 10m-a-year contract by Toyota to provide electrical wiring
systems for the cars it is to produce at Burnaston, Derbyshire.
Lucas said last night the contract, starting in December, would initially
lead to the creation of 100 jobs in the joint venture company, Lucas SEI
Wiring Systems. The jobs will be at a plant in Newcastle-under-Lyme,
Staffordshire, assigned to the joint venture by Lucas's Rists Wiring Systems
subsidiary.
Employment is expected to rise further as car output increases in the 1990s.
Toyota plans to produce 31,000 cars - to replace its current Carina range -
in 1993, its first full year of production at the plant. Output is due to
rise to 100,000 a year by 1995 and to 200,000 in 1997. Industry observers
believe the figure may rise significantly by the end of the decade.
The Lucas-Sumitomo contract is one of 150 that Toyota is awarding to
European-based suppliers.
Initial European content of the cars will be slightly less than 60 per cent.
Toyota is understood to have set a long-term local-content goal of 90 per
cent.
