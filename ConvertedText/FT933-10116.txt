FT  05 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Sell-off depresses BA shares


   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and ZHANG TINGTING


SEEMINGLY good traffic figures for July from British Airways failed to
impress the market and the shares fell back 6 to 339p. Hefty turnover of 22m
included one block of 8m dealt at 343 3/4 p. Transport analysts said they
were worried by the load factor, which showed a year-on-year decline of 2.1
per cent. 'The trend is worrying,' said one specialist, 'and has serious
implications for group revenues.'
BA said its growth in traffic of 11.5 per cent was the largest monthly rise
this financial year and, together with a 15 per cent rise in the same period
last year, represents a 25 per cent traffic increase in the past two years.
