FT  26 OCT 92 / Observer: Dogged


When it comes to bringing the best out of politicians, few can surely
compare with a small dog saved from drowning in the Thames by former
Conservative MP Matthew Parris, now earning his keep with the pen.
Having made the rescue in his days as an aspiring Tory candidate, he was
delighted when Baroness Thatcher, then his party's leader, agreed to
publicise his deed by joining him and the dog and its young owners for a
photo-call on Westminster Bridge.
As a result, he discovered one of his leader's prime characteristics as a
top politician - one which some readers may think her successors share.
'For the little dog, named Jason, attempted to mate with Mrs Thatcher's
leg,' Parris told the Market Research Society's annual dinner. 'Yet she
continued to smile, pose and shake hands . . . .
'It was then I saw her ability to pretend nothing was happening on top when
everything was going wrong down below.'
