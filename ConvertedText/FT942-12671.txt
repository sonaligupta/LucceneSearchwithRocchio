FT  28 APR 94 / UK Company News: Sage up 32p to 600p after US improvement


   By ALAN CANE


Shares in Sage Group yesterday gained 32p to close at 600p after the
Newcastle-based accounting software company reported interim figures
indicating that problems at two US subsidiaries had been overcome.
The shares are now within 3 per cent of their peak of 619p a year ago; they
have been recovering from a sharp fall in July which followed a profits
warning relating to the US companies.
Profits before tax in the half year to March 31 rose 28 per cent to Pounds
6.86m (Pounds 5.38m), on turnover ahead 21 per cent to Pounds 25.4m (Pounds
21m).
Sage supplies packaged accounting software, chiefly aimed at small and
medium-sized companies, and sold through a network of resellers.
Mr David Goldman, chairman, said that software sales in the UK, which
advanced 26 per cent, had been helped by a new emphasis on making it
attractive for resellers to add value to the company's products.
This had been helped by the close relationship with Microsoft, the world's
largest software supplier.
All subsidiaries were now trading profitably. DacEasy, the principal US
offshoot, made an operating profit of Pounds 1.3m on sales of Pounds 6.9m,
an improvement of 32 per cent, in a highly competitive environment.
TeleMagic, formerly Remote Control International, turned a first half loss
last year of Pounds 370,000 into a Pounds 47,000 profit on sales of Pounds
1.5m.
The latest acquisitions, Ciel in France and Dataform in the UK, continued to
make satisfactory profits.
Sage has launched a low cost accounting system for the domestic market and
intends to launch products in all its business areas which exploit the
success of Windows, Microsoft's market-leading operating system.
The company has net cash of Pounds 9m, up from Pounds 4.2m at September 30.
Mr Goldman said expansion would continue to be sought through acquisition.
The interim dividend goes up to 3.65p (3.32p), payable from earnings per
share of 22.25p (17.68p).
