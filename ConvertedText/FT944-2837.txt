FT  15 DEC 94 / Walesa set to veto pay laws

President Lech Walesa (left) is set to veto Poland's new public sector pay
laws which form a mainstay of next year's budget. Mr Leszek Spalinski, the
president's spokesman, said yesterday that it was 99 per cent certain the
law would be vetoed in line with the president's promise to hunger-striking
health workers protesting against the new regulations. The governing
coalition, which controls 298 seats in the 460 member parliament, needs a
two-thirds majority to overrule the veto, which means it will have to secure
a handful of opposition votes if the budget is to be saved. The
Solidarity-led hunger strikers representing 600,000 health service workers
want the government to return to a law passed in 1989 promising public
sector employees an average wage 6 per cent higher than the average
industrial wage. That pledge was never implemented. The new law would offer
wage increases reaching 5 percentage points over the 23 per cent inflation
rate expected for next year. The health service unions say that this is not
enough as already this year their pay is running at 20 per cent below wage
levels in the rest of the economy. President Walesa is widely expected to
veto the entire budget once it is passed by parliament early next year to
win favour with voters before next autumn's presidential elections, which
will see him running for a second term.
