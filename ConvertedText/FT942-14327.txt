FT  21 APR 94 / EU plans rules on bankruptcy

Sweeping new pan-European insolvency procedures could be in place by the end
of this year, or next year at the latest. The text is nearing completion for
a European bankruptcy convention which would require the courts in each
member state to recognise one another's authority and insolvency
proceedings. Details were revealed by Mr Manfred Balz, chairman of the EU
Council group on bankruptcy and head of the Berlin office of lawyers Wilmer,
Cutler & Pickering.
Mr Balz said the convention would permit the liquidator in the principal
country of a liquidation to stall proceedings in other countries where a
company has subsidiaries, and require EU courts to recognise the authority
of practitioners from other countries. Cross-border insolvency problems have
been highlighted by the case of Lancer Boss, the UK lift-truck manufacturer
forced into receivership after unilateral action by banks against its German
subsidiary. Once final negotiations with EU members are complete within the
next few months, the text will be forwarded to the Council of Ministers.
