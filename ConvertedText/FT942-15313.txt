FT  15 APR 94 / International Company News: Heinz in talks with Borden


   By FRANK MCGURTY


   NEW YORK


HJ Heinz, the US grocery products group, revealed it was in talks with
Borden, the US food and wallpaper group. However, Heinz refused to confirm
reports it was buying the bulk of its food-services division.
Borden also declined to comment. The sale of its food business, which
generated Dollars 270m in revenues last year, would represent the first
divestment since the troubled group announced a far-reaching restructuring
earlier this year.
The company is seeking to concentrate on its most profitable lines,
including pasta sauces and several niche grocery products. After posting a
net loss of Dollars 593.6m last year, it said it would sell more than
Dollars 1.25bn in assets, including its salty snacks and seafood businesses,
which generated nearly 20 per cent of its 1993 revenues.
For Heinz, the Borden food services division would make a logical fit with
its own core business, which supplies individual plastic pouches of
mayonnaise, ketchup and other condiments to restaurants, schools and
hospitals.
