FT  15 JUN 93 / SEC lifts restrictions on Zeneca share deals


   By PAUL ABRAHAMS and MAGGIE URRY


UNDERWRITERS of Zeneca's Pounds 1.3bn rights issue will be able to trade
normally in the shares over the next few days after the US Securities and
Exchange Commission changed its decision on restrictions.
The SEC had previously said that underwriters would only be able to trade
'passively' in the last five days before the June 21 close, starting today.
But this limitation, which had raised fears that the underwriters would not
be able to support the share price, has been removed.
However, the SEC has said that the US marketing syndicate, which was seeking
buyers for the new shares in Zeneca, the bioscience group demerged from
Imperial Chemical Industries this month, had to stop operations as of last
night.
The syndicate was satisfying demand for shares by buying nil-paid Zeneca
shares in the UK market.
The syndicate can still operate outside the US. Zeneca's brokers declined to
comment on how successful the US syndicate had been. News of the SEC's
change of heart came after the market closed with Zeneca's shares up 1p to
617p, and the nil-paid down 1p at 17p. The rights issue is priced at 600p.
Zeneca yesterday announced the US Food and Drug Administration had approved
Zestril for the treatment of congestive heart failure.
The licence is for those patients not responding adequately to diuretics or
digoxin, a medicine extracted from foxgloves. There are between 2.3m and 3m
sufferers from the disease in the US, according to the American Heart
Association.
Both Merck's Vasotec and Bristol-Myers Squibb's Capoten have already
received licences for this indication.
Sales of products based on Zestril were Pounds 294m last year, an increase
of 31 per cent on 1991.
The company said growth continued during the first quarter of this year.
