FT  20 APR 94 / Call to boost lead in genetics


   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor


Britain's leading international position in human genetics must be
reinforced through more public and private investment, a government advisory
committee said yesterday.
The Committee on Human Genome Research expressed concern about the likely
impact of National Health Service reorganisation - both on gathering family
information for mapping genetic diseases and on providing genetic screening
for patients.
'There is increasing difficulty in obtaining information and samples from
extended families, as hospitals and GP fund-holders become concerned to
identify and restrict activities which fall outside their contractual
obligations,' the committee's report said.
Professor Malcolm Ferguson-Smith of Cambridge University, a committee
member, said the planned abolition of regional health authorities, combined
with the NHS's new purchaser-provider arrangements, threatened the research
and screening services carried out at Britain's 14 regional genetics
centres.
