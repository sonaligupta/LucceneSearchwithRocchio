FT  22 DEC 92 / Bank lending curbs hit money supply


   By ROBERT THOMSON


JAPAN'S money supply in November contracted 0.5 per cent from the same month
last year, reflecting the impact of curbs on new lending by the country's
banks, which are burdened by non-performing loans.
The contraction of M2 plus certificates of deposit followed a fall of 0.6
per cent in October and marked the third straight month of year-on-year
decline, prompting Japanese business organisations to call for an easing of
lending restrictions.
However, the Bank of Japan argues that the contraction is due more to weak
demand for new lending than to the banks' inability to lend. The bank said
money supply growth was likely to return soon, as the October contraction
appeared to have been the turning point.
The bank prefers to judge trends from the broadest measure of liquidity,
which includes postal savings funds, and which grew by 2.6 per cent in
November, compared to a year earlier, down from 2.7 per cent growth in
October.
Money supply growth has slowed sharply over the past two years.
In October 1990, broad money expanded 11.8 per cent on a year earlier, but
the growth fell in virtually every month until September, when it contracted
0.4 per cent.
