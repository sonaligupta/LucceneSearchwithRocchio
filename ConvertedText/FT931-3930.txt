Telecom NZ


   By TRACY CORRIGAN and REUTER


BARCLAYS de Zoete Wedd has bought 109m shares in Telecom Corporation of New
Zealand, worth around NZDollars 297m (Dollars 156m), from Bell Atlantic
Holdings, reducing Bell's stake by 4 percentage points to just under 30 per
cent.
The New Zealand government sold Telecom NZ to the local subsidiaries of two
US telecommunications companies, Bell Atlantic and Ameritech, in 1990, with
the requirement that they should reduce their joint holding to under 50 per
cent by September 1994 (recently extended from September 1993).
BZW is distributing the shares to investors in Europe and elsewhere, in
conjunction with ABN Amro and Caisse des Depots.
Nomura Securities will open a branch in the Japanese city of Akashi, Reuter
reports. The new branch raises Nomura's retail network to 149 outlets.
