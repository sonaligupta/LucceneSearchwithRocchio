FT  08 JUN 92 / People: TSB Scotland's new boss


TSB Bank Scotland, one of the more successful parts of the TSB Group, has
found its new chief executive from within its own ranks. It is bringing back
to Scotland Alastair Dempster, a 51-year-old Scot who is currently chief
executive of TSB Bank Channel Islands.
The job became vacant when Charles Love, a long-serving TSB man, left to
become chief executive of the Clydesdale Bank, the Glasgow-based institution
which belongs to National Australia Bank.
Dempster joined TSB from Royal Bank of Scotland in 1986. He was TSB's
director of commercial banking and international until 1991 when he moved to
the Channel Islands.
Whereas Love latterly combined running TSB Bank Scotland with being head of
branch banking, which is run from Birmingham, Dempster will concentrate
purely on Scotland.
TSB Bank Scotland is the fourth largest bank north of the border, after
Royal Bank of Scotland, Bank of Scotland and Clydesdale.
In the year to October 31 1991 its profits grew by 26 per cent (to Pounds
77m).
