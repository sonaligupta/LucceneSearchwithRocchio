FT  23 APR 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Dental work to chew on


   By DELLA BRADSHAW


If you want to prevent tooth decay you should be choosy about the type of
artificial sweetener in your chewing gum, according to research from the
Central American country of Belize.
The 28-month study of 1,000 10-year-olds, conducted by Kauko Makinen of the
University of Michigan Dental School, showed that children who regularly
chewed xylitol-sweetened gum had half the new cavities of children who
chewed gum containing rival sweeteners.
The research was sponsored by Leaf, of Finland, which makes gum containing
xylitol. Xylitol is found in fruits and plants and produced commercially
from birchwood. Makinen says that unlike other sweeteners, xylitol helps
neutralise plaque acids and so promotes natural remineralisation. Leaf: UK,
