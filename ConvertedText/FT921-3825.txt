FT  12 MAR 92 / Solution close in Moscow's row over debt


   By LEYLA BOULTON


   MOSCOW


Russia and Ukraine yesterday appeared close to a compromise on repaying the
former Soviet Union's foreign debt of more than Dollars 60bn after talks
between leaders of the two republics, Leyla Boulton reports from Moscow.
Mr Vitold Fokin, the Ukrainian prime minister, and Mr Gennady Burbulis,
Russia's first deputy premier, met yesterday before talks today between
representatives from all 15 former Soviet republics. A deal could be agreed
at a meeting of heads of government scheduled for tomorrow if a compromise
between the two richest republics is acceptable.
Under the possible compromise, Ukraine would subscribe to 'joint and
several' responsibility for the debt on condition the Vnesheconombank, the
foreign trade bank, is removed from Russian jurisdiction to become more of a
shared institution.
