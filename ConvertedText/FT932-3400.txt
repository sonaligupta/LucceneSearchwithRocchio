FT  15 JUN 93 / Banks decide not to wait


   By JAMES BLITZ, Economics Staff


THE French interest rates cut was a further indication that European central
banks are not waiting for Germany to ease monetary policy.
The last easing in the Bundesbank's monetary policy took place more than a
month ago when the central bank reduced the cost of lending D-Marks to
commercial banks via its 'repo' rate to 7.6 per cent. In spite of this, the
D-Mark has remained rather weak against most currencies as dealers grow
increasingly concerned by the scale of the German recession and the size of
its budget deficit.
Pressures on the D-Mark have led central banks to think they can cut rates
without fear of their currencies coming under pressure in the ERM.
Yesterday, the Bank of Portugal took a similar step to France's, cutting its
key mop-up rate by  3/4 of a percentage point to 11.25 per cent.
Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, Danish central bank governor, was also reported as saying
that he would like to cut his country's interest rates as soon as possible,
and would not necessarily follow the Bundesbank. Speaking at the meeting of
central bank governors in Basle, he gave no indication of when this might
take place.
France's move had no effect on the French franc yesterday, which closed
unchanged at FFr3.363 to the D-Mark. However, the escudo closed lower at
Es95.00 per D-Mark from a previous Es94.90.
