FT  30 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Babcock Prebon Pounds 49m deficiency


   By JANE FULLER


Babcock Prebon, a financial services group that went into receivership in
September owing Pounds 50m to its banks, has been compulsorily wound up in
the High Court with a net deficiency of Pounds 49m.
Cork Gully, the receivers, sold the main trading businesses to management as
soon as they were called in by Samuel Montagu,
Babcock Prebon's demise was blamed on its high debt, recession and
substantial rental commitments on four properties it vacated to move into
new offices in Broadgate.
In August it announced losses of Pounds 8.5m for the first six months of the
year, after Pounds 30m losses in the previous 18 months.
