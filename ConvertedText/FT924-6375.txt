FT  21 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Benchmark losses doubled at Pounds 9.5m


Benchmark Group, the financial services group, reported pre-tax losses
doubled at Pounds 9.5m, against Pounds 4.93m, in the year to June 30.
The loss is made up of trading losses of Pounds 2.17m (Pounds 117,000
profit), provisions against development properties of Pounds 3.91m (Pounds
4.21m), provisions against investments of Pounds 1.7m (Pounds 840,000) and
provision in respect of leased premises Pounds 1.7m.
After an unchanged extraordinary charge of Pounds 2.71m, relating to
provisions on the sale of Benchmark Bank, the loss for the year came out at
Pounds 12.4m (Pounds 7.63m). As a result net assets are less than half the
called-up share capital.
The company said that various options for the future had been examined and
it was decided that it should become a property investment group.
Discussions were being held to bring in the necessary expertise.
Turnover was Pounds 16.7m (Pounds 18.8m). Losses per share were 6.04p
(8.42p) after taking into account last year's rights issue.
Hong Leung Group has a stake of 48 per cent while Guocco Group holds a
further 14.99 per cent.
