FT  30 OCT 93 / Fiat and GKN in joint venture

   LONDON


FIAT of Italy and GKN, the UK motor components and industrial services
group, are discussing forming a joint company to supply Fiat with constant
velocity joints - the key element of front-wheel drive systems - from a new
manufacturing facility to be built near Florence.
If final agreement is reached, Fiat would close its Novoli plant in Florence
making the joints and concentrate production at the new facility at Campi
Bisenzio, 15 kilometres away.
The Novoli plant currently employs around 800 people.
GKN said yesterday the move would require 'substantial investment,' but
would not give details.
It is in line with Fiat's declared strategy of concentrating on designing,
developing and assembling vehicles while buying in key components from
partners with which it can form long-term relationships.
An agreement would be of considerable importance to GKN.
The components are a basic requirement for all front-wheel drive vehicles
and Fiat is Europe's second-largest carmaker, with output approaching two
million vehicles a year.
GKN has been supplying constant velocity joints to Fiat from its Brunico
plant, in northern Italy, for about 15 years.
The agreement could be in place early next year with production likely to
start in 1995.
