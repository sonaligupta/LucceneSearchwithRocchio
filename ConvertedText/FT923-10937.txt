FT  28 JUL 92 / UK Company News: ADT acts over Britannia audit


   By ROLAND RUDD


ADT, the Bermuda-based security and car auction company, yesterday issued a
writ against Binder Hamlyn alleging negligent statements in connection with
its Pounds 110m takeover of Britannia Security Group.
Mr David Hammond, ADT's deputy chairman, said: 'We have started proceedings
against Binder Hamlyn, Britannia's auditors, alleging negligent
misrepresentations in connection with our acquisition of Britannia.'
ADT alleges that at a meeting prior to the takeover in January 1990 Binder
Hamlyn said that Britannia's financial statement for the year to June 1989
was both true and fair. That statement, says ADT, contained 'material
inaccuracies'.
Its 1991 annual report reveals that a review of Britannia's businesses
showed that certain assets, particularly subscriber systems installed at
customer premises 'had been included in the consolidated financial
statements of Britannia at values materially in excess of their net
realisable value.'
This led to a Dollars 278m (Pounds 145.5m) goodwill write-off on the
acquisition which made ADT into Britain's second largest burglar alarm
company.
Binder Hamlyn said it could not comment since the partner who acted for
Britannia was away on holiday.
