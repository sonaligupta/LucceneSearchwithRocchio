FT  11 MAR 94 / Survey of European Property (5): Sharp differences between
regions - Research by a property consultant found that the main commercial
centres suffered a much more severe recession than the middle-ranking cities
/ Germany


   By DAVID WALLER


Germany's worst recession since the second world war has caught up with the
country's highly regionalised commercial property market. Rents fell across
the board last year and there is a growing volume of empty space as building
projects commissioned before the downturn come onto the market.
According to Muller International Immobilien, a German commercial property
consultant, average rents for prime office space dropped from DM51 a sq m to
DM45 a sq m over 1993, a fall of about 12 per cent. The volume of unoccupied
property surged in Germany's 12 leading cities from 1.4m sq m in 1992 to
2.4m sq m in 1993; up more than 70 per cent.
The data conceal sharp regional differences. Muller found that Germany's
main commercial centres suffered a much more severe recession than the
middle-ranking cities. For example, the volume of space let in Cologne and
Hanover was at exactly the same level in 1993 as in 1992 while in Dresden
and Leipzig, coupled with Essen in the Ruhr area of northern Germany, there
was a sharp increase in volume of space rented out.
'These three cities all represent 'young office' markets at an early stage
of development,' Muller comments. In the east German cities, the market also
benefited from a high level of pent-up demand, although this was not enough
to stop a 17 per cent fall in rents in Leipzig.
The picture for the more highly developed office markets in Dusseldorf,
Frankfurt, Hamburg and Munich was much worse. Rentals fell by 29 per cent in
Munich and 24 per cent in Berlin while the volume of space let fell by a
dismal 49 per cent.
Another negative factor was the surge in unoccupied space which in the 12
cities surveyed by Muller climbed from 1.4m sq m in 1992 to 2.4m sq m in
1993. Add in a slight increase in the volume of space under construction, to
5.2m sq m, and the volume of available space after pre-lettings and
owner-occupation rose to a record 6.7m sq m - 4 1/2 times the level of space
let last year.
In Frankfurt, which retained its position as Germany's leading office
property market in terms of rentals levels and volume of space let, the
volume of unoccupied space has surged in the past two years. Including
peripheral locations and offices under construction, the volume of
unoccupied space in Frankfurt stands at 1.3m sq m; five times the 250,000 sq
m let last year. Up until the 1991 building boom, unoccupied space had for
years averaged a modest 150,000 sq m.
Notwithstanding the space overhang, the future of the Frankfurt market is
far from bleak. The decision to site the future European Central Bank in
Frankfurt will consolidate the city's role as continental Europe's leading
financial centre. Independent of this decision, foreign banks have steadily
devoted greater resources to the German market.
It is the international flavour of the Frankfurt office market, with demand
dictated to a large extent by foreign financial institutions, which has
driven the fall in rentals in the city. Last year, the highest rent achieved
was DM75 a sq m, a long way from the near-DM100 a sq m levels of 1991-92.
When the world economy recovers it is to be expected that foreign
institutions will continue to upgrade their commitment to Finanzplatz
Germany - Germany as a financial centre - to Frankfurt's advantage.
In other cities, the property downturn was triggered more by the domestic
recession. Munich was the worst hit, reflecting the impact of the recession
on sectors such as electrical engineering, computer technology, aerospace
and vehicle manufacture, all strongly represented in the Bavarian capital.
Berlin has also suffered as a result of the recession, but the political
doubts hanging over the city's future - another negative for the office
property market - have to some extent been lifted by the German parliament's
reaffirmation that Berlin will become reunited Germany's capital by the end
of the decade.
With the German economy making at best a slow recovery in 1994-95 - and at
worst entering into the second stage of a 'double-dip' recession  - the
German office property market is set for further consolidation.
An underpinning of the market is, however, likely to come from international
investors looking for bargains and from the domestic open-ended property
funds, a form of investment vehicle which has proved highly popular with
individual investors over the past year.
According to Mr Oscar Kienzle, head of Knight Frank & Rutley's German
operations, there is DM10bn invested in the funds, pent-up demand equivalent
to half a year's normal purchasing activity. This money must, by law, be
invested in property, and is likely to provide healthy liquidity support for
the German market.
