FT  12 NOV 92 / Irish Company News: Allied Irish Banks buoyed by strong
performance in US


   By TIM COONE


   DUBLIN


ALLIED IRISH Banks, the Republic's largest clearing bank, reported an 8.9
per cent increase in pre-tax profits to IPounds 95.6m (Pounds 104.7m) for
the six months to September 30, against IPounds 87.8m last time.
The rise was achieved through the growing contribution to profits from First
Maryland Bancorp of IPounds 36m (IPounds 18.8m) and a 10 per cent reduction
in loan loss provisions to IPounds 91.1m (IPounds 100.5m).
Losses in the UK division at IPounds 17.2m (IPounds 18.1m) were down
substantially from losses of IPounds 28.9n in the half-year to March 31.
Mr Kevin Kelly, financial director said: 'The banking environment in the UK
continues to be difficult, but there has been a stabilisation of our
non-performing loans and our retail banking activity in the UK has shown a
modest profit.'
Non-performing loans in the UK amounted to IPounds 353m, down from IPounds
370m, equal to 19 per cent of the loan portfolio there, compared to IPounds
306m in Ireland (5.3 per cent of the portfolio) and IPounds 97m in the US
(3.1 per cent of the portfolio).
A surge in employee costs, from IPounds 199m to IPounds 231.6m, was due to
'one-off' costs of an agreement with the bank unions on extended opening
hours in the Republic and rationalisation costs in the UK.
Mr Gerald Scanlan, group chief executive, said that the underlying wage cost
increase was only 4.5 per cent.
In the Irish division, there was a 4 per cent decline in profits due to
lower business activity and an increase in loan loss provisions.
Mr Kelly said that the bank's biggest concern was the 'flattening out' of
lending in the Irish market.
Disaggregated figures were not given, but the group's overall loan portfolio
fell by 10 per cent, from IPounds 13.4bn to IPounds 12bn, with total assets
slipping from IPounds 18.4bn to IPounds 18.1bn.
Mr Kelly said that the Irish market had been an 'engine of growth' for the
group as a whole.
The Tier One capital adequacy ratio improved to 6.9 per cent (6.7 per cent).
Earnings per share rose to 9.2p (8.5p) and an interim dividend of 3.8p
(3.6p) is declared.
COMMENT
Of all the clearing banks on both sides of the Irish Sea, AIB continues to
stand out as being the only one not to have been downgraded over the past
year by the rating agencies. Losses in the UK have been brought under
control, and costs are set to fall further in 1993. The one cloud on the
horizon is the worrying outlook for the bank's core market in Ireland. The
next results - due in three months as the year-end is changing to December -
are likely to reflect a further deterioration in lending and non-performing
loans, caused by sterling's fall in September and the current high level of
Irish interest rates. If rates do not fall significantly in the months
ahead, economic activity may stagnate in 1993. Thus, it is handy that the
well-timed expansion into the Maryland banking market is now contributing to
the bottom line. Pre-tax profits for 12 months to December are forecast at
around IPounds 220m for a p/e of 9.
