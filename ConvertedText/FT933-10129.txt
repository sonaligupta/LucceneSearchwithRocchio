FT  05 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mine output fall clouds value
of eastern Germany's Laubag


   By JUDY DEMPSEY


   BERLIN


THE MARKET value of Laubag, eastern Germany's largest lignite or brown coal
fields, will be influenced by the continuing fall in mining production in
the region, energy experts said yesterday.
Mining output in eastern Germany, including potash, fell by 9 per cent in
May, compared with the previous month, and by 15 per cent for April and May,
compared with the same period in 1992.
These figures, released earlier this week by the federal economics ministry,
suggested the fall in energy consumption in eastern Germany had not yet
bottomed out - energy consumption in eastern Germany fell 12 per cent in
1990 and a further 26 per cent in 1991. The decline, caused by the collapse
of eastern German industry, which has caused a sharp fall in energy
consumption, coincided with efforts by the Treuhand, the privatisation
agency for eastern Germany, to sell Laubag, which is in Brandenburg.
A consortium, headed by Rheinbraun, the brown coal division of RWE Energie,
and which included PreussenElektra and Bayernwerk, western Germany's largest
utilities, was negotiating with the Treuhand to buy the fields.
But the negotiations stalled over the Treuhand's efforts to secure
guaranteed long-term annual coal delivery contracts of 57m tonnes.
Utility officials said yesterday that the consortium instead wanted 'short
contracts, perhaps only about three years initially, because we have no idea
at what volume energy consumption will start increasing in eastern Germany
over the next 20 years'.
Estimates of the value of Laubag, which has an annual production of 65m-70m
tonnes, range from DM1bn-DM2bn.
