FT  12 MAR 93 / Observer: If the suit fits . . .


What a marvellous idea by would-be sleuths at the Daily Mail to launch a
nationwide competition to identify the mysterious tax-deductible secretary
of BBC director general John Birt. A prize of Pounds 500 or one of the great
man's favourite Armani suits was promised.
Unfortunately, the launchers need not have bothered. All they had to do was
to read yesterday's FT to learn that the lady was Jane Birt, the director
general's wife.
