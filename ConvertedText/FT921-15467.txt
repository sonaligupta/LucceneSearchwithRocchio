FT  10 JAN 92 / Hong Kong double labour importation scheme


   By ANGUS FOSTER


   HONG KONG


Hong Kong has almost doubled its labour importation scheme to 25,000 foreign
workers in an attempt to deal with the colony's labour shortage, writes
Angus Foster in Hong Kong. The decision was immediately criticised by trade
unions and liberal politicians who claim the policy will keep wages down
when inflation in Hong Kong is still above 11 per cent. The scheme, which
brought in 13,800 workers from China and elsewhere in Asia in 1991, is for
general occupations but does not cover workers for the colony's new airport.
A separate scheme for the airport will be launched once construction begins
next year.
