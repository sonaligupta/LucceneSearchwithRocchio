FT  11 APR 92 / Cookery: Great Cooks and their Recipes


'Charcoal kills us, but what does it matter? The shorter the life the
greater the glory.'
Not the words of Napoleon Bonaparte but those of that Napoleon of the
kitchen, Antonin Careme who was often styled 'the greatest cook of all
time.' A delightful evocation of his life re-appears in an updated and
re-illustrated version of Anne Willan's Great Cooks and their Recipes, From
Taillevent to Escoffier (Pavilion Books, Pounds 25) published this week.
Specially-commissioned colour paintings by Michael Boys, and the use of
period paintings and etchings, make it worth its place in the dining room.
Willan gives a potted biography of 14 chefs and choses recipes to illustrate
the strength of each. Recipes appear in their original form with a
re-working for the 1990s cook. The book's most appealing aspect is the
descriptions of the lives of the great cooks. Bedtime as well as kitchen
reading.
