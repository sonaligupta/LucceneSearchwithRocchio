FT  15 APR 94 / Observer: Honk honk


Should HSBC shareholders be concerned about this week's defections from
Midland Global Markets? Vib Baxi, who had made a lot of money for the bank's
own account in last year's obligingly bullish fixed income markets, and
Gerry Reynolds, who was mysteriously put in his place as head of proprietary
trading last December, have both packed their bags, destination unknown.
There's been a wrangle about bonuses, but some in the City are convinced
that there are some possible hefty losses too. MGM would hardly be alone if
it had dropped a cent or two in the first quarter of this year, a time of
extraordinary volatility since the Federal Reserve raised its rates. But
clearing banks are not supposed to behave in quite the rash way hedge funds
do.
Whether or not Baxi and colleagues have suffered what the rumour mongers
suggest, people who earn bonuses on positions that subsequently turn sour
can expect unsympathetic glances from their pals.
The HSBC balance sheet has easily accommodated some spectacular losses in
the past. But it might be worth shareholders raising the odd question at the
annual meeting on May 27.
