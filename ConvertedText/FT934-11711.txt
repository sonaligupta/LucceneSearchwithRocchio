FT  29 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: World grain estimate cut
sharply


   By RICHARD MOONEY


THE INTERNATIONAL Wheat Council has scaled back its forecast for 1993-94
world grain production in response chiefly to lower-than-expected harvests
of coarse grains such as maize and barley in Kazakhstan, Russia and the US.
Total production of wheat and coarse grains in the current season is now
estimated by the London-based agency at 1.373bn tonnes, down from the 1.39bn
tonnes forecast a month ago and 50m tonnes below the 1992-93 outturn.
The IWC's latests Grain Market Report, published yesterday, puts the world
wheat crop at 570,000 tonnes, down 5m tonnes from the estimated quoted in
its September report but still 8m tonnes above the 1992-93 figure and, if
attained, the second highest annual production total on record. The coarse
grains total is estimated at 803,000 tonnes, down 12m tonnes from the
September report and 58m tonnes from last year.
The report attributes the lower wheat forecast to 'lower figures for Canada,
Kazakhstan and the United States'.
Canadian output would be reduced because of a lower planted area, late crop
maturation and excessive rainfall late in the season, the IWC said. In
Kazakhstan, it said, the harvest would be 'good. . . although lower than
last year's record' of 18.3m tonnes at 16.5m tonnes. 'Unfavourable weather
and shortages of fuel' had led to the lower estimate. Wet weather had led to
a 1.5m-tonne reduction in the US wheat estimate, comapred with the September
projection, but the outturn was still expected to be marginally higher than
last year's at 67m tonnes. The IWC said the wet weather had also raised
concerns about the quality of the US crop.
The US maize crop would be 'dramatically lower at 178m tonnes - compared
with the 186m tonnes suggested in the September report and 240.8m tonnes in
1992-93 - the IWC said.
It explained that harvesting in the midwest was well behind normal, 'mainly
due to the fact that farmers so far have concentrated on harvesting
soyabeans while waiting for the moisture content in maize to decrease'.
Coarse grain crops in the former Soviet Union were also expected to be lower
than expected 'but better than last season'.
The report blamed adverse weather conditions during harvesting, as well as
shortages of fuel and machinery.
