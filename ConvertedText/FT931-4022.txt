FT  12 MAR 93 / International Company News: Varity bounces back into black
with Dollars 27m advance

VARITY, the automotive parts, farm equipment and diesel engine maker,
yesterday reported a sharp improvement in financial performance over the
past year, including a two-thirds jump in operating income and a similar
drop in long-term debt.
Net earnings of the Buffalo-based company were USDollars 27m, or 32 cents a
share, in the year to January 31, compared with a Dollars 178m loss, or
Dollars 7.87 a share, in the previous 12 months.
Before extraordinary items, income in the latest period was Dollars 39.7m.
These items include a Dollars 23.6m loss from the sale of Massey Ferguson's
distribution and finance business.
The bulk of the previous year's loss consisted of a Dollars 108.3m
restructuring charge.
Sales for 1992 rose to Dollars 3.37bn from Dollars 3.17bn, due largely to a
12 per cent improvement at Kelsey-Hayes, the automotive parts maker which
specialises in wheels and anti-lock braking systems.
Operating income, excluding restructuring losses, jumped to Dollars 218m
from Dollars 131m. Long-term debt stood at Dollars 305.2m on January 31,
down from Dollars 864.2m a year earlier.
Mr Victor Rice, chairman, yesterday forecast a further improvement in
earnings this year.
Kelsey-Hayes, which Varity acquired in 1989 and which contributes almost
half its revenues, is expected to benefit from a stronger North American
market, especially for light trucks.
Earnings at Massey Ferguson and Perkins, the diesel engine maker, will be
boosted by weak sterling. On the other hand, Mr Rice predicted a further
decline in the European farm equipment market this year.
Varity's improved fortunes have been reflected in a sharp rise in its share
price on the New York stock exchange. The shares were trading at Dollars
35.75 before the close, up from Dollars 25.25 at the beginning of the year.
