FT  30 NOV 94 / International Company News: Fall in net financial income
hits Carlsberg

Carlsberg, the Danish brewery group, recorded a 10 per cent fall in group
net profits, to DKr885m (Dollars 145.1m) from DKr982m in the year ended
September 30.
The decline was attributed almost entirely to a fall in net financial
income, to DKr124m from DKr465m in the previous year. This reflected
unrealised losses on holdings of Danish bonds and shares.
The group proposes an unchanged dividend of DKr3 per share.
Operating profit rose 6 per cent - 'slightly more than anticipated' - to
DKr1.15bn from DKr1.08bn, on sales up to DKr16.91bn from DKr15.59bn.
The group said total beer sales (which include the Tuborg as well as the
Carlsberg brand) were up 10 per cent to 30m hectolitres, of which 82 per
cent was sold outside Denmark.
The market reacted by knocking DKr17 off the Carlsberg A share, which fell
to DKr263.
Brewing associates outside Denmark - including Carlsberg-Tetley in the UK,
and breweries in Germany, Italy, Portugal, Malawi, Malaysia and Hong Kong -
showed an overall improvement in operating results. Results from Danish
operations were unchanged.
The group anticipates 'a very high level of activity in years to come', as
it consolidates its position as a leading presence in international brewing.
Mr Poul Svanholm, group chief executive, said Carlsberg was still
considering acquiring breweries abroad, but had no immediate plans.
International sales are expected to continue to expand. Asian markets,
including China, are particularly solid for the group. However, it warns
that substantial investments will be required in marketing and distribution.
'These investments are not expected to have a positive effect on earnings
until a later stage,' it said.
