FT  06 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Babcock wins Pounds 39m order


Babcock Africa, the South African subsidiary of Babcock International, has
announced a package of boiler refurbishment, materials handling and process
plant contracts worth a total of Pounds 39m.
The biggest single contract is for the redesign and replacement of pressure
parts on six boiler units at Matla power station in the Transvaal.
Babcock was the original supplier of the boilers in the early 1970s, and the
latest work is the initial stage of a programme to extend the power
station's life by 35 years.
The subsidiary has also won two other Transvaal contracts - overland
conveyors and a silo for the Alusaf aluminium smelter project, and two
circular stockpile stacker reclaimers for Randcoal's Duvha colliery.
In conjunction with Hyundai of Korea, it will supply and erect an advanced
synthol reactor for Sasol, the South African fuel and chemicals group, at
Secunda in Orange Free State.
