Mr John Elliott, the Australian businessman, and six former associates who
are facing charges in connection with an allegedly fraudulent ADollars 66m
(Pounds 32.5m) foreign exchange deal, were yesterday remanded on bail to
appear in Melbourne Magistrates Court on August 1, when committal
proceedings are expected to begin, Nikki Tait reports from Sydney.
The National Crime Authority's case against the seven men was essentially
straightforward, lawyers told a Melbourne court yesterday, but would involve
24 volumes of documentary evidence and 90 witnesses. The committal hearing,
they warned, could take three months.
