FT  29 JUL 92 / UN team begins inspection


   By MARK NICHOLSON, Middle East Correspondent and Agencies


UNITED NATIONS weapons inspectors searched Baghdad's agriculture ministry
for more than six hours yesterday after the weekend agreement to allow the
UN access to the building.
'There's still work to be done,' Mr Achim Biermann, the German leader of the
team, said after his first tour of the building. 'So we'll have to go back
tomorrow.'
As the inspection began, columns of demonstrators marched through the Iraqi
capital, carrying anti-American and anti-UN banners but they were kept well
away from the agriculture ministry.
Mr Biermann and six other UN experts entered the building just a few hours
after arriving in Baghdad.
Under the compromise agreement reached with Iraq, two American members of
the UN team stayed outside the building.
A previous UN team was barred from the ministry for three weeks, sparking
off a tense confrontation between Iraq and the western powers. UN officials
believed the agriculture ministry building housed documents and other
materials suspected to be linked to Iraq's chemical, nuclear and ballistic
weapons programmes.
A UN official said inspection of the building might take another day or two.
'So far the team has not had the chance to get all members together to put
together all the many observations and the notes they have made in the
building,' he added.
Mr Rolf Ekeus, head of the special commission into Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction, said earlier that much of what UN inspectors suspected had been
hidden in the building might have been removed.
Mr Douglas Hogg, British Foreign Office minister, meanwhile sought yesterday
to keep alive the threat of military action against Iraq, telling BBC Radio
that Britain would take 'whatever steps may be necessary' to force Iraqi
compliance with UN resolutions. 'That may very well involve the need to use
military force.'
