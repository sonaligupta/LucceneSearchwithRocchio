FT  22 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: Fund based on Brazilian debt


   By RICHARD WATERS


THE range of structured funds aimed at investors who want a geared bet on
Latin American debt has been expanded this week by what is thought to be the
first based on Brazilian debt instruments.
Morgan Grenfell, the UK merchant bank, has created two tranches of debt
based on Brazilian IDU bonds, with a total face value of Dollars 100m. The
bonds trade at about 60 per cent of face value.
Morgan is selling Dollars 35m of senior notes, based directly on IDU bonds,
and Dollars 25m of junior notes, geared instruments which give about three
times the exposure to the bonds than would be gained by investing directly.
