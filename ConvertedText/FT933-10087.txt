FT  06 AUG 93 / Virgin steps up Sunday campaign

VIRGIN, the British music and book retailer, yesterday raised the stakes in
its battle to open its French megastores on Sundays by threatening to cancel
its plans to expand in France.
'Our expansion plans, which would generate 1,000 jobs in five years through
the opening of 25 new stores, cannot go ahead as it would be impossible to
draw up a reliable budget estimate,' the group said. It estimates that its
megastore on the Champs Elysees, its main French outlet, generates 20 per
cent of its sales on Sundays.
Yesterday's statement is the latest volley in the company's battle over
Sunday trading in France. The battle has split the French government and set
Virgin's French employees against the country's trade unions, which oppose
reform of the 1906 Sunday trading law.
The costs facing Virgin have also risen sharply. Earlier this week, a Paris
court raised sharply, from FFr250,000 to FFr4m (Pounds 450,000), the fines
that will be imposed on Virgin if it ignores the ban on Sunday trading.
The company has opened its outlets for the past four Sundays in defiance of
a court ban and is appealing against the fines.
The case has split the French government. Mr Jacques Toubon, the culture
minister, said yesterday that Virgin should be granted an exception to the
Sunday trading ban because it provides access to cultural goods. But Mr
Michel Giraud, the labour minister, caught between a desire to safeguard
jobs and the court ruling, urged Virgin to obey the law.
