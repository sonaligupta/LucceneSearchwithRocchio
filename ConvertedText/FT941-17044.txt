FT  06 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Capital changes for Beckenham


   By NIGEL CLARK


Losses on a contract for the Civil Aviation Authority have forced Beckenham
Group, the USM-traded heating and ventilation engineer, to seek a capital
reconstruction including a placing and rights issue.
The losses resulted in the withdrawal of most of its banking facilities in
September, since when the group has had to rely on short-term finance from
shareholders.
Beckenham also announced pre-tax losses of Pounds 4.2m (Pounds 5.05m) for
the year to the end of October on turnover of Pounds 31m (Pounds 34.1m),
including Pounds 1.66m this time from acquisitions. Losses per share were
4.4p (11.3p).
The changes will result in a concert party led by Mr Ng Lu Siong, a
Malaysian businessman, raising its holding to a total of 39.8 per cent. The
Takeover Panel has waived the requirement to make a full bid.
Mr Peter Long, chairman, said that after a 'nightmare three months' he was
hopeful of a better 1994, although margins would remain tight.
The company is raising Pounds 3.9m net through a placing of 15.6m shares at
25p. A further Pounds 1.09m net is being raised by a rights issue of up to
5.45m shares at 25p on the basis of 1-for-30 ordinary 5p and 26-for-27
Pounds 1 preference shares.
The total proceeds will eliminate the Pounds 4.27m of short-term loans and
increase working capital by Pounds 723,000.
In addition, 50 of the existing 5p ordinary will be consolidated into one
250p share and then divided into three 25p ordinary and seven deferred
shares.
Every 15 of the preference shares will be consolidated in one Pounds 15
share and then divided into 26 ordinary and 34 deferred.
It is proposed to eliminate the deficit on the profit and loss account by
cancelling the deferred shares and reducing the share premium account.
