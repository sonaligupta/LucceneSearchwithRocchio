FT  29 APR 94 / International Company News: Turnround at SKF in first term

SKF, the world's leading maker of roller bearings, showed a strong upward
trend yesterday when it announced a SKr661m (Dollars 83.7m) turnround in the
first quarter.
It said the SKr306m surplus, after losses of SKr355m a year ago, was helped
by clear evidence of recovery in leading European markets.
Mr Mauritz Sahlin, managing director, said: 'The recovery in the European
economy means that SKF's most important market is now on the way up again
after four years of decline.'
He said the group expected a full-year profit of about SKr1bn, compared with
the SKr669m deficit last year.
The 12 per cent rise in group sales to SKr8.05bn was driven by a 10 per cent
increase in volumes.
Sales to Europe rose faster than the market, consolidating the company's
leading position. The automotive industry, its most important segment,
accounted for a big portion of the increased volumes, with sales to Italy,
Germany, Spain and Sweden all rising strongly.
Both the group's main businesses, Seals and Bearings and Ovako Steel,
returned to the black. For Ovako, the special steels unit, it was the first
quarterly profit since 1989.
Seals and Bearings produced a SKr274m surplus, swinging from a loss of
SKr250m. This was after sales expanded to SKr7.46bn from SKr6.68bn.
Ovako achieved a SKr35m profit on sales of SKr929m. This compares with a
loss of SKr109m in the first quarter of 1993 on sales of SKr724m.
However, SKF does not consider Ovako a core operation, and its improved
performance may facilitate a sell-off.
SKF intends to start production in China, partly to meet the expected growth
in demand for ball bearings from the country's car industry.
