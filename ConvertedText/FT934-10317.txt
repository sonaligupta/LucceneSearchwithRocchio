FT  05 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading


   By STEVE THOMPSON


THE steep declines throughout many equity markets undermined confidence in
stock index futures, during a session of intense activity which saw the
premium of the future over the cash market shrink to around two points,
writes Steve Thompson.
A weak overnight Wall Street, plus flurries of selling across European
markets, triggered heavy downside pressure in the Footsie December future at
the outset of trading. The contract fell through the 3,150 level to the
day's low of 3,143 in mid-morning.
Thereafter, a good rally set in, with December pushed up to the day's high
of 3,167 over the lunchtime period, as traders anticipated a steady opening
by Wall Street, before sliding back during the late afternoon to close at
3,153.
Dealers said most of the big activity had been concentrated in the 3,150 to
3,160 band, with bears said to be increasingly worried that any further
weakness in US bonds could trigger a rise in US interest rates and shift
back substantial US funds from Europe to the US market. 'There is a real
concern that some of the 'hot money' in this market could move elsewhere,'
said one leading trader. Turnover expanded to more than 12,000 contracts.
BP headed the list of most active traded stock options, with 2,400 lots
dealt after the group surprised the market with much better than expected
third-quarter results.
