FT  26 JUN 92 / Black Sea summit acts to end Moldova conflict


   By REUTER and JOHN MURRAY BROWN


   ISTANBUL


THE presidents of Russia, Ukraine, Romania and Moldova agreed yesterday on
steps to end the conflict between Moldovan forces and Slav separatists in
TransDnestr, the eastern region of Moldova, Reuter reports from Istanbul.
A communique after a two-hour meeting in the Turkish city called for the
opening of corridors for humanitarian aid and free movement of civilians and
observers from the four governments. It said Russia would eventually
withdraw its 14th army from the conflict zone, as Moldova has demanded.
Also meeting in Istanbul, Turkey and eight former communist states of the
Black Sea region joined Greece and Albania in signing a framework economic
agreement in an attempt to revive trade relations stalled since the collapse
of the Soviet Union, John Murray Brown reports. A call was made for
'effective mechanisms to achieve a higher degree of economic co-operation'
in areas such as transport, telecommunications, infrastructure and
environment.
The summit grouped Turkey, six former Soviet republics (Russia, Ukraine,
Georgia, Moldova, Azerbaijan, Armenia) and Romania, Bulgaria, Greece and
Albania. A Turkish official said the 11 countries would 'probably' set up a
bank on the lines of the European Development Bank or the World Bank.
Member countries seemed just as intent to stress the need for political
solutions to the region's ethnic problems. Georgian leader Eduard
Shevardnadze warned that the Black Sea project could prove 'stillborn'
unless the region's security was guaranteed.
