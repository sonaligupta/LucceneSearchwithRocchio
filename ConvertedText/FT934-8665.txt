FT  13 NOV 93 / EU, S Korea in chemicals accord


   By JOHN BURTON


   SEOUL


THE European Union and South Korea yesterday concluded talks on intellectual
property rights covering EU pharmaceutical and agricultural chemicals.
The agreement was announced after the annual EU-Korean ministerial meeting
held between Sir Leon Brittan, Europe's chief trade negotiator, and Mr Han
Sung-joo, the South Korean foreign minister, in Seoul.
The EU and Korea have been negotiating during the last two years on
retroactive product protection of EU pharmaceutical and agricultural
chemicals based on a 1991 framework agreement.
Sir Leon also asked South Korea to open its rice market as part of the
Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade - something
Seoul has persistently refused to do demanding an exception to the
all-tariffication rule.
Korea can not be granted an exception because it would threaten 'to unravel'
other agreements already reached during the Gatt talks, Sir Leon said.
He also complained about discriminatory tariffs on imported European cars
and official harassment of buyers.
'The purchase of a foreign car should not be regarded as an unpatriotic act
and one that will draw the attention of the tax authorities,' he said.
