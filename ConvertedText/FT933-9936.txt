FT  06 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Rotork advances 28% to Pounds 6.2m


   By ANDREW BOLGER


SHARES IN Rotork rose 6p to 178p after the Bath-based valve control
manufacturer reported a 28 per cent increase to Pounds 6.2m in first half
pre-tax profits.
Sterling's devaluation helped to increase sales by 26 per cent, to Pounds
34m, in the six months to June 30.
The company said that although the strength of its order book indicated some
further improvement in the second half, when small acquisitions would be
contributing for the first time, general market weakness justified a note of
caution.
Rotork Actuation, which makes valves to open and close pipes, traded
strongly in the first half of the year, with record bookings and shipments.
The company said that while Actuation was enjoying unparalleled demand, many
of its markets were, paradoxically, under varying degrees of economic
pressure.
'Here depreciation of sterling has been a significant help in countering
savage pricing from major international competitors seeking to win back lost
market share.'
Rotork Instruments experienced good input for its emergency shutdown systems
in the first half despite generally low levels of capital commitment in the
UK.
Rotork Analysis, however, which supplies air monitoring equipment, found
orders hard to come by.
In May, Rotork acquired the Hallikainen range of refinery analysers for
Pounds 1.16m. Coupled with Hone, the group said that gave a sound base from
which the gas market could grow once economic and legislative conditions
improved.
Earnings per share advanced by 29 per cent from 3.5p to 4.5p.
The interim dividend is increased from an adjusted 1.55p to 1.75p.
