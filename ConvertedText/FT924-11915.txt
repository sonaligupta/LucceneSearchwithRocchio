FT  23 OCT 92 / International Company News: Dassault tumbles 43% at midway


   By ALICE RAWSTHORN


DASSAULT Aviation, the French fighter aircraft and business jet group,
suffered a sharp fall in profits during the first half of this year.
The company reported a fall in net profits of 43 per cent from FFr193.8m in
the first six months of 1991 to FFr111.1m (Dollars 21.7m) in the same period
of 1992 on sales which rose by 4.1 per cent to FFr6.48bn.
Dassault has sustained a sharp contraction in turnover since 1990, when it
made sales of FFr16.7bn in the full financial year. Its turnover fell to
FFr14.35bn last year and, according to the company, should rise to around
FFr15bn this year.
Mr Serge Dassault, chairman, recently announced that the group had secured
orders with a value equivalent to three years' revenue. Dassault yesterday
confirmed that the orders received in the first half of the year were worth
FFr5.29bn.
However, the company said that it did not expect the flow of orders to
continue at the same pace in the second half. Dassault has invested heavily
in two long term projects - the Rafale aircraft designed for naval and
ground attack and the Falcon 2000 business jet. Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, the
pharmaceuticals subsidiary of the Rhone-Poulenc chemicals group, saw net
profits rise by 29 per cent from Dollars 201.9m to Dollars 261m in the first
three quarters of the year. This has fuelled an increase in earnings per
share from Dollars 79.9 to Dollars 90.6 over the same period.
