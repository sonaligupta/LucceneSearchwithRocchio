FT  12 MAR 92 / Appointments: Building Hepworth


John Carter has been appointed chief executive of Hepworth, the building
products group. He replaces Sinclair Thomson, 49, who has been forced to
resign through illness.
Thomson joined Hepworth as chief executive in 1986, the year Roland Smith
became chairman. He presided over the group's expansion into a European
building products business, with nearly half its profits coming from
overseas; before it had been heavily dependent on clay pipes and the UK
economy. He was regarded as one of the best chief executives in the sector.
Before following Thomson to Hepworth, Carter, 46, was a colleague of his at
TI Group, where his posts included marketing manager of the Glow-worm
subsidiary, now part of Hepworth, and managing director of New World gas
cookers.
Carter brought the plastics and clay pipe business together to form
Hepworth's largest division. Building products accounted for a quarter of
group turnover of Pounds 686m in 1990 and about a third of Pounds 102m
operating profit. He has been a board member since 1988.
