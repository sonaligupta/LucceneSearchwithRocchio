FT  28 APR 94 / Income tax on the cards for Cuba


   By CANUTE JAMES

Introduction of income tax and a reduction in state funding for a range of
economic enterprises are among measures to be debated by Cuba's national
assembly on Sunday. The special session, called in response to the
deteriorating economy, will also review the effect of economic changes over
the past eight months.
Increasingly concerned about its budget deficit, the government announced a
50 per cent cut in the budget for the armed forces last month, saying the
military should 'cost the country as little as possible'.
Given the central role of the armed forces in Cuban politics, the reduction
is a telling indicator of the nature of the economic problems facing the
country, diplomats in Havana said.
Introduction of income tax is intended to recapture billions of pesos in
circulation which government officials say are being used by Cubans to
purchase hard currency. The government announced last year that Cubans were
free to hold foreign currency.
The assembly debate will effectively be a continuation of the regular
session which was held last December. That reviewed the government's more
liberal attitude to foreign currency, foreign investment and increasing
private and co-operative ownership of farms and a range of small businesses.
Since then, however, there have been signs that the island's economy is
buckling.
