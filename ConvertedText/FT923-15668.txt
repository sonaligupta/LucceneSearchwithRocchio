FT  01 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Wheway runs up Pounds 715,000 loss


   By PETER PEARSE


WHEWAY, the environmental engineering group, fell from profits of Pounds
1.37m pre-tax to losses of Pounds 715,000 in the 26 weeks to March 28.
Mr John McGowan, chairman, said good performances in Scandinavia, France and
the US were not enough to offset the the recession-induced downturns in the
UK and Australia.
Atlas Wright, the computer room air conditioning systems company which
accounts for 60 per cent of the group's total volume, saw a deferring of
orders from the first to the second quarters.
That resulted in group losses of Pounds 1.75m in the first quarter.
Despite this collapse in other companies' capital expenditure, Mr McGowan
said that Wheway's recovery was 'not solely dependent on general economic
recovery', adding that the Pounds 10.3m investment made two years ago in air
filtration technology was now beginning to see some return.
Turnover declined 11 per cent to Pounds 37.5m (Pounds 42.1m) and operating
profits 81 per cent to Pounds 483,000 (Pounds 2.48m).
The group was tipped into losses by interest payable - albeit lower at
Pounds 773,000 (Pounds 1.11m) after last July's Pounds 16.5m rights issue -
and exceptional charges of Pounds 425,000, relating to reorganisation and
redundancy costs.
Debt at period-end stood at Pounds 12.7m; before the rights issue it was
Pounds 28.6m.
Mr McGowan said the group was becoming 'more and more focused'. He described
the intra-group trading as 'huge', with the environmental engineering and
clean air divisions operating in much the same markets.
Losses per share emerged at 0.51p (earnings 1.1p) but the interim dividend
is held at 1p.
