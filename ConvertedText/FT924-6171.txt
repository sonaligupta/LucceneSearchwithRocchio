FT  23 NOV 92 / Observer: No laughing matter


Every one knows that De Beers' chairman Julian Ogilvie Thompson is the most
powerful man in the diamond business. So obviously he was top of the list
when the Diamond Insight newsletter carried out a light-hearted survey
asking people in the trade: 'What is the first thing that comes to mind when
you hear the word diamond? And what is the second?'
Alas, we shall never know what Ogilvie Thompson thinks. While others
replied, loading their comments with words such as love, beauty, and
eternity, a De Beers' PR flunky took the matter much more seriously.
'Having discussed the contents of your letter with my colleagues, it would
appear that the answer which Mr Ogilvie Thompson would give to your question
would distort the result of your survey, given his position and contact with
diamonds and the diamond industry. It is, therefore, with regret that we are
unable to participate in your survey.'
Things may be gloomy in the diamond market, but surely they are not bad
enough to rob De Beers of its sense of proportion.
