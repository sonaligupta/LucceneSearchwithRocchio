PEUGEOT-CITROEN is to extend short-time production at its factories at
Mulhouse in eastern France, to adapt to declining demand in the French
automobile market, the company said yesterday, writes John Ridding in Paris.
Production will stop for four days in September, taking the total to 33 days
since the start of the year. Mulhouse, which produces 1,400 cars a day, is
the main French production centre for Peugeot-Citroen, with Sochaux and
Poissy,
Last month, the company said that its Sochaux factories would also stop
production for two days in August and three days in September.
