FT  29 APR 94 / Guppy loses sentence appeal


Mr Darius Guppy yesterday lost his appeal against a five-year prison
sentence for conspiracies to defraud, steal and commit false accounting.
However the appeal court cut fines of Pounds 539,000 to Pounds 227,000 and
converted them into a compensation order in favour of Lloyd's insurers who
paid Pounds 1.8m for a bogus gems robbery.
Mr Benedict Marsh, Mr Guppy's partner, had his five-year sentence cut to
four years and fines of Pounds 535,000 quashed after the court heard he had
repaid Pounds 561,000 to Lloyd's underwriters.
