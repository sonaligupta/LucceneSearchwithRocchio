FT  30 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Japan's corporate groups are accused of
obstruction


   By ROBERT THOMSON

JAPAN'S Fair Trade Commission, the anti-monopoly body, has found that the
corporate groupings known as 'keiretsu' sometimes obstruct competitors and
exclude potential partners, including foreign companies, in the glass, car
and paper industries.
In examining the so-called vertical keiretsu, which involve links (often
cross shareholdings) among manufacturers and their suppliers and
distributors, the FTC listed behaviour it said was inappropriate but not
necessarily in breach of anti-monopoly regulations.
The keiretsu have been targeted by the US government, which argues the
groupings are exclusive and limit business opportunities for foreign
companies. There are two types of keiretsu; the horizontal corporate
families, such as Mitsubishi and Mitsui, which cover a wide range of
industries, and the vertical, which focus on a specific industry.
FTC officials found that the links to sales agents of sheet glass companies,
car parts makers, and paper manufacturers had remained almost unchanged over
the past five years. Some restrictions were imposed on sales to companies
outside the keiretsu and special discounts were offered to keiretsu members.
The FTC findings confirm some US complaints about the closed character of
the keiretsu. However, the commission indicated it planned no punitive
action against the companies surveyed.
