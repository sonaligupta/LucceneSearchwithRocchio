FT  28 MAR 92 / Tracing plan for medical products

MANUFACTURERS of medical devices in the US will soon be required to trace
systematically their products through the distribution chain to the patient
if proposals put forward yesterday by the US Food & Drug Administration
(FDA) become law.
Mr David Kessler, FDA commissioner, said: 'Tracking will help the FDA
protect the public by providing the information necessary to quickly remove
dangerous and defective devices from the market. Identifying and following
patients who receive these devices is also critical, so that the patients
can be notified promptly of any problems.'
The proposals would apply only to permanent implants and life-sustaining or
life-supporting devices. Manufacturers would have to develop a system of
tracing, identifying and reporting patients' names and locations of devices
to the FDA within three days.
The FDA said its new rules would apply to all devices approved after May 28.
The proposals come as concern grows that the government agency is incapable
of ensuring public safety. It has come under attack for being slow to remove
potentially unsafe medical devices, ranging from silicone gel breast
implants to heart valves, from the market.
Many experts believe that part of the problem with long-term product safety
is that the FDA has no power to monitor devices once they are on the market.
