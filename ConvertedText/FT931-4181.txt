FT  12 MAR 93 / Suharto's deputy elected


   By WILLIAM KEELING


   JAKARTA


GENERAL Try Sutrisno was elected vice-president of Indonesia yesterday by
the People's Consultative Assembly, writes William Keeling in Jakarta.
General Sutrisno, who retired as head of the armed forces last month, was
the only candidate, just as President Suharto had been a day earlier when
elected for his sixth five-year term of office.
The general now becomes the favourite candidate to succeed 71-year-old Mr
Suharto.
Gen Sutrisno could provide a counter-balance to Mr Suharto. Diplomats say
relations between the two men cooled following a massacre by soldiers in
1991 of civilians attending the funeral of a pro-separatist activist in the
disputed territory of East Timor. Gen Sutrisno vociferously defended the
military's actions.
