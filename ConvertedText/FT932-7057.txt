FT  26 MAY 93 / Clinton battles to secure deficit cuts


   By JUREK MARTIN


   WASHINGTON


PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday intensified his lobbying for the House of
Representatives to pass his deficit reduction package tomorrow, but was told
by some Democratic congressmen that he needed to make his case in a
nationally televised address.
Congressman Bill Richardson of New Mexico complained that 'we seem to have
lost the perception game'. He was referring to congressional critics who
contend the package relies too much on tax increases and not enough on
spending cuts to achieve its goal of reducing the budget deficit by about
Dollars 500bn (Pounds 324.6bn) over five years.
House members are particularly agitated that their vote tomorrow may be
negated later in the Senate, as happened with Mr Clinton's economic stimulus
programme.
The bill in front of the House includes the energy tax, the particular
object of Senate discontent. The Democratic leadership in the House remains
guardedly confident that it can carry the day. A total of 218 votes are
needed to pass, and the Democrats currently hold a 257-176 edge, with one
independent and one vacancy. Mr Clinton was to meet with freshmen members
later yesterday.
One indication of the administration's concern was the report it is
considering moves to bypass the Senate finance committee, due to vote next
week on the programme.
Alternative plans include having the budget committee write the bill or, in
extremis, having it written on the Senate floor itself. The Democrats only
hold an 11-9 majority on the finance committee which could disappear if Sen
David Boren of Oklahoma carries out his threat to oppose the bill unless the
energy tax is substantially amended.
