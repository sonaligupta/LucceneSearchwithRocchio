FT  27 MAR 92 / Assurance on defence review


THE LABOUR PARTY yesterday told defence manufacturers that a Labour
government would not apply a freeze on contracts while it reassessed
military requirements.
Mr Martin O'Neill, Labour's chief defence spokesman, also promised that the
present level of defence expenditure would be available through the 1992-93
financial year.
Subsequently, he added, there ought to be scope for savings.
He told the Royal United Services Institute that a Labour government would
set up a 'small group' to oversee the review, would consult widely and would
aim to present its conclusions to parliament in the autumn.
Arms suppliers have shown growing concern about a possible moratorium on new
contracts during a defence review. Such a move has been specifically
proposed by the Liberal Democrats in their call for a comprehensive review.
Mr O'Neill said that several contracts were near signing. He added: 'I don't
think we would see a freeze till October.' However, some 'sensitive'
purchases might have to await the outcome of the review.
