Thailand's new government is committed to liberal trade based on a free
market system and will further loosen control on money and capital markets,
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai told parliament yesterday, Reuter reports from
Bangkok.
'The government will carry out a policy of liberal economy by using market
mechanism and doing away with monopoly and unfair competition,' Mr Chuan
said in his first policy statement. Mr Chuan's Democrat Party won the most
seats in the September 13 general election and leads a five-party coalition.
