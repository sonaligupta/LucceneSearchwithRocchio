FT  29 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Market report


   By REUTER


Nickel retreated further on the LME yesterday as the market continued to
stage a downward correction to recent strong gains. Dealers said the absence
of recent influential buying contributed to the downtrend, while negative
fundamental factors also weighed on sentiment. LME stocks rose 876 tonnes to
17,400 tonnes, the highest level since September 1984, reflecting arrivals
of Russian metal, and more shipments are said to be en-route. There are also
increasing prospects of a German steel-workers strike, which will reduce
offtake by stainless-steel mills. London robusta coffee prices closed lower,
while New York arabicas were down at midday after setting lifetime lows. 'We
are in a steady downtrend right now and the market is awaiting the outcome
of the ICO meeting next week,' he said. Meanwhile Brazil's National Economy
Secretary Dorothea Werneck said the country would not be taking any firm
proposals to next week's ICO working group meeting in London. New York
cotton prices were lower at midday after scoring lifetime lows for the
second straight session. Abundant world supplies, declining consumption and
bearish sentiment will continue to pressure prices, traders said.
