FT  12 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: HSBC Holdings


HSBC's value has risen from 2 per cent to 2 1/2 per cent of the All-Share
since it joined the index in the summer. So it was no surprise to see
institutions scrambling to take advantage of yesterday's Pounds 435m share
offer. Simply accepting HSBC's paper for Midland would have left them
seriously underweight in a company whose total capitalisation is in the
process of overtaking that of BAT. Still, institutions who waited until
yesterday to make good the shortfall have done themselves no credit. The
bank has outperformed the market by some 50 per cent since July.
Latecomers can cover their embarrassment by claiming that the party does not
look quite over. Hong Kong equities have proved resilient in the face of
China's frosty response to Mr Christopher Patten's democracy proposals.
Local banking profits remain buoyant. HSBC should easily be able to earn in
excess of 50p this year which puts it on an undemanding forward multiple of
around 10.
But the glow cannot last for ever. HSBC does not need the proceeds of the
issue. Tier 1 capital will rise from a comfortable 6.4 per cent to a
supremely comfortable 6.9. The fact that it has chosen now to tuck the extra
capital away must say something about its own perception of its share price.
Once US interest rates turn, Hong Kong's economy, and therefore the
prospects for HSBC, could look distinctly different.
