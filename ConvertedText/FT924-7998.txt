FT  13 NOV 92 / Letter: Investment in equity at heart of industrial
regeneration


   From Mr GEOFFREY MADDRELL


Sir, We read with interest your brief report ('Call to double share sales
duty', November 10) that the National Association of Estate Agents is
recommending the doubling of stamp duty on the transfer of shares on the
basis that 'share ownership is a luxury, not a necessity'.
It seems that the association has totally failed to understand the
fundamental issue facing Britain and the economy, namely industrial
regeneration through investment in productive industry to lead the way out
of recession and to ensure we have companies able to compete effectively
with the best in world markets.
Such investment has to be funded; we have learned from hard experience of
the dangers of relying totally on bank debt.
Accordingly, what the National Association of Estate Agents fails to
understand is that investment in equity, and thereby share ownership, lies
at the heart of out industrial regeneration.
