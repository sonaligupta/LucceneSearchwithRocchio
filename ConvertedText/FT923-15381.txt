FT  02 JUL 92 / Press body may face legal action


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


MR BOB BORZELLO, who submitted more than 125 complaints against the press to
the Press Council, is to try to take the Press Complaints Commission to
judicial review.
Mr Borzello has instructed solicitors Stephens Innocent to begin proceedings
against the commission - which succeeded the Press Council  - because it
will not in most cases accept 'third party' complaints. The commission,
which adjudicates on breaches of a Code of Practice, usually accepts
complaints only from those directly affected.
Mr Borzello, chairman of graphic arts company Camden Graphics, has
specialised in complaining about alleged derogatory references to racial or
social minorities.
Mr Mark Stephens, of Stephens Innocent, says the PCC is being unfair over
third-party complaints. He believes every breach of the code involves a
significant issue of public interest.
Lord McGregor, commission chairman, said Mr Borzello's lawyers had been in
touch, but added: 'We are not going to change our ways at all.'
