FT  11 MAR 92 / Money Markets: Rate hopes dashed


RATES EASED slightly during the day on the UK money markets but firmed at
the close as lingering hopes of a Budget day base rate cut were dashed.
Those hopes had been encouraged by a strengthening of sterling early in the
afternoon amid rumours that Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, would make
a commitment to taking the pound into the narrow ERM band.
This was reflected in a softening of money market rates - generally by  1/32
or  1/16 per cent - across the spectrum, until a rather mixed reaction from
the markets caused sterling to lose its earlier gains, making the
possibility of a rate cut even more remote.
The key three months interbank rate began at 10 7/16 -10 5/16 per cent and
then slipped as far as 10 5/16 -10 1/4 per cent. It firmed to 10 1/2 -10 3/8
per cent after the Budget.
The 12 months rate declined to 10 1/4 -10 1/8 per cent, from 10 5/16 -10
3/16 per cent, but later bounced back to 10 3/8 -10 1/4 per cent.
The Liffe March sterling contract went as high as 89.70 from 89.64, before
heading down to 89.55, while the June contract followed a similar pattern,
to end at 89.75.
Otherwise, there were few problems with liquidity, and the overnight rate,
which stood at around 10 per cent early in the day on expectations of a
fairly moderate shortage, fell quickly to 8-7 1/2 per cent after midday,
when the Bank of England moved to cover all of its revised shortfall by
purchasing Pounds 400m of band 1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent.
The Bank had initially forecast a shortage of around Pounds 350m, the main
factors draining liquidity from the system being treasury bills and maturing
assistance of Pounds 348m, and exchequer transactions of Pounds 150m. These
were partly compensated for by a fall in note circulation and above-target
bankers' balances.
German call money rates remained unchanged at around 9.60/65 per cent.
Dealers said the market was quiet, but call money rates were seen remaining
high as banks geared up for a heavy outflow of funds through tax payments
later this week.
The market was looking ahead to today's securities repurchase transaction,
hoping the Bundesbank would add between DM2bn and DM4bn. They predicted that
otherwise tight liquidity could mean call money rates reaching the Lombard
level of 9.75 per cent.
