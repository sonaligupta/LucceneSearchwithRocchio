MR Rajan Pillai, a Singapore-based businessman nicknamed the 'Biscuit King'
for his processed food empire, has been charged in court with offences under
the local companies act, Reuter reports from Singapore.
Mr Pillai, 45, chairman of Singapore's Britannia Industries, pleaded not
guilty. He was arrested on Wednesday and charged with having illegally
authorised loans from Britannia to companies in which he had significant
stakes to help them acquire Britannia shares.
He was released on bail of SDollars 500,000 (Pounds 214,788) after
Thursday's hearing. A commercial affairs department official said his
passport had been impounded.
Britannia is a holding company for several subsidiaries incorporated in
India, Pakistan, Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, New Zealand and Britain.
They manufacture and market branded biscuits, cereals and other food.
Britannia's turnover in 1992 was more than Dollars 700m.
Mr Pillai is charged with sanctioning SDollars 10.68m in loans in November
1989 to a Liberian-incorporated company, Pacific Talon, to help it acquire
Britannia shares. In December 1990, he is alleged to have lent SDollars
11.25m to Pacific to help it acquire more Britannia shares. Mr Pillai has a
large stake in Pacific, the official said.
The offences are punishable with up to three years' jail or a SDollars
20,000 fine or both.
