FT  05 JUN 92 / Sharp rise in self-employed


   By CHARLES BATCHELOR


THE NUMBER of self-employed people in Great Britain rose sharply during the
past 10 years but will probably grow more slowly in future, a Department of
Employment study published yesterday says.
Self-employment rose by 1.1m, or 52 per cent, between 1981 and last year to
3.3m.
The number of people working for themselves also rose in other developed
countries, but nowhere as fast as Britain. Between 1979 and 1989, the
increase was more than three times the average for the European Community.
Although Britain managed to narrow the gap in self-employment numbers with
other countries, it did not close it. The self-employment rate was still
nearly 2 per cent below the EC average in 1989.
Reasons for the rise in self-employment included government policies to help
start such businesses. Many factors were one-off changes that have more or
less worked through, so the pace of future change will be more consistent
with other countries, the study says.
