FT  17 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Yen's sharp decline
wipes out Nikkei's early gains


   By NEIL WEINBERG


   TOKYO


PRICES received an early boost from New York's record close overnight but
quickly retreated on pressure from the yen and index-linked and arbitrage
selling, writes Neil Weinberg in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average closed down 162.94 at 21,612.19, the lowest finish since
December 11 1991. It hit a daily high of 22,134.88 and a low of 21,500.55.
Volume rose to 240m shares after Tuesday's 179m. The market was closed on
Wednesday for a national holiday.
Declines outnumbered rises by 597 to 353 with 168 issues unchanged. The
Topix index of all first-section stocks fell 6.02 to 1,618.38 and in London
trading the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 2.35 to 1,228.88.
The early morning surge on index-related and foreign buying quickly ran out
of steam. Weakness in the bond market and the yen's sharp decline against
the dollar prompted unloading of shares and triggered sell programs among
foreign institutions.
Many investors took a wait-and-see stance amid continuing trust fund and
corporate sales and the unfolding scandal involving Mr Fumio Abe, former
secretary general of Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa's ruling party faction.
'Some people think that if the Nikkei breaks below strong (technical)
support at 21,600, it will hit 20,000 in the next few days,' said Mr
Masateru Igata of Salomon Brothers.
Speculative issues were the day's biggest losers, with Takuma off Y180, or
14 per cent, at Y1,080 and Clarion down by Y100 at Y830. Talk of financial
trouble among speculative groups led to the sell-off, in a sector which has
outperformed the Nikkei index by about 20 per cent in recent weeks, noted Mr
Igata.
Export-oriented shares fared well on the yen's decline, with TDK advancing
Y230 to Y4,230 and Sony Y80 to Y4,080. Financials also advanced, with
Industrial Bank of Japan up Y50 to Y2,950 and Daiwa Securities Y20 to
Y1,110.
In Osaka, the OSE average declined 140.96 to 23,057.71 in volume of 27.4m
shares. Nissei Build lost Y160 to Y4,610.
Roundup
HONG KONG continued to power ahead, as Wall Street encouraged most of the
region.
HONG KONG advanced solidly to a third consecutive record high, helped by
Wall Street and optimism over US-Sino trade talks. The Hang Seng Index
climbed 29.48 to 4,412.14 in turnover of HKDollars 1.92bn, up from HKDollars
1.76bn.
Property counters turned in the day's best gains, while other important
sectors were moderately higher.
SINGAPORE rose for the second consecutive day and the positive sentiment
spilled over into KUALA LUMPUR. The Straits Times Industrials Index ended
19.75 or 1.3 per cent up at 1,529.05 in turnover of SDollars 305.7m after
SDollars 235.5m. The KLSE composite index climbed 16.95 or 3.1 per cent to
569.23, its highest close since August 14, in turnover of MDollars 187.6m
after MDollars 92.1m.
Singapore motor dealer Cycle & Carriage jumped 45 cents to SDollars 6.90 in
an active 864,000 shares, on reports that the company's motor franchises
have been increasing their market share in spite of government measures to
control car growth.
TAIWAN closed above 5,000 for the first time in five months on expectations
of a cut in domestic oil prices. The weighted index, wavering in a 100-point
range all day, ended 83.89 or 1.7 per cent higher at 5,022.96 in turnover of
TDollars 49.3bn after TDollars 48.7bn.
AUSTRALIA lost ground on rumours that the budget deficit had soared to
ADollars 9bn from the official forecast of ADollars 4.7bn. The All
Ordinaries index closed at 1,673.5, down 2.1, in turnover of ADollars 275m.
The finance minister, Mr Ralph Willis, denied the rumours after hours.
The All Resources index held on to early gains, rising 5.5 to 954.4 with the
help of the lower Australian dollar.
Turnover included the placing of 5m MIM shares at ADollars 2.40 by McIntosh
Securities. MIM closed five cents lower at ADollars 2.39. The fall follows
Wednesday's announcement that interim net profit had slumped to ADollars 16m
from ADollars 67.5m a year ago.
NEW ZEALAND was lifted by a 22 cent rise in Fletcher Challenge to NZDollars
3.62 on overseas buying. The NZSE-40 index gained 14.07 to 1,517.77 in
turnover of NZDollars 33.83m.
SEOUL lost early gains as rumours of a summit between the presidents of
North and South Korea and of lower oil prices were denied by the government.
The composite stock index ended up 5.56 at 610.19 in turnover of Won357bn
after Won231bn.
BANGKOK saw the most active day in the 16-year history of the Stock Exchange
of Thailand, turnover hitting Bt8.59. The SET index rose 15.34 to 758.33,
the largest index gain in more than a month.
Some brokers said that the market had heated up too fast. The SET president,
Maruey Phadoongsidhi, said on Wednesday that from January 20 the margin loan
requirement will be increased from 40 to 50 per cent.
