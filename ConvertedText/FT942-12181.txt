FT  30 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Redrow upset - New issues


Plans by Redrow, Britain's biggest private housebuilder, to come to the
market have been upset by the recent stock market jitters which have seen
construction shares underperform the FT-SE-A All-Share Index by 8 per cent
since the end of February.
The company, which earlier this year had been expected to command a market
value of Pounds 350m, revealed on Thursday that it had scaled down its
plans.
Redrow is selling 87m shares at 135p to raise Pounds 117m - giving the group
a market capitalisation of Pounds 298m. Redrow is seeking to raise Pounds
55.4m from the sale of 41m shares while Steve Morgan, its founder and chief
executive, is raising Pounds 62m from the sale of 46m shares, reducing his
stake to 60 per cent.
Previously, Morgan had planned to raise Pounds 100m, reducing his stake to
about 50 per cent. But he decided to reduce the size of the sale following
the recent decline in building shares.
Up to 35 per cent of the shares will be sold to the public, the remainder
placed with institutions. It is the third housebuilder to come to the
market, behind Beazer Homes and Wainhomes both of which have recently been
trading below their issue prices.
Shares should open at a small premium unless the market collapses between
now and dealings starting on May 17.
Hamleys, founded in 1760, is coming to the market in an offer of shares at
185p valuing the self-styled 'finest toy shop in the world' at Pounds 42.3m.
Through the 1980s the company had a chequered history but new management led
by Howard Dyer, chairman, and Stephen Woodbridge, managing director, has
restored its purpose and profits over the past three years.
Operating margins have more than doubled to 17 per cent, boosting operating
profits for the year to January to Pounds 3.6m. That only matched, however,
the 1986 level.
Hamleys is heavily dependent on its flagship store in Regent Street, London.
It attracts 5m visitors a year, of whom 30 per cent buy something. The
company plans to grow the business by opening small outlets in airports and
tourist centres and to open concessions in other retailers.
At 185p, the shares were priced on a notional historic p/e of 17.8, a
discount to the retail sector's 19.
A notional dividend of 4.7p for the year ended January 29 would give a gross
yield of 3.2 per cent - higher than the sector average of approximately 2.8
per cent.
