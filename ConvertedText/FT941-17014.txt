FT  06 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rubber makes bright start to
1994


   By KIERAN COOKE


   KUALA LUMPUR


The new year has started well for the world's natural rubber producers with
prices rising in response to increased demand in many industrialised
economies and a squeeze on supplies caused by a fall off in production in
major producing countries.
Mr Aldo Hofmeister, the Kuala Lumpur-based buffer stock manager of the
International Natural Rubber Organisation, says he expects natural rubber
prices to rise by about 5 per cent in 1994, compared with last year.
'I am not too pessimistic,' says Mr Hofmeister. 'The US economy continues to
rebound and West Europe is expected to improve by mid-year. Japan is still a
question mark, but South Korea is doing well.'
As an indication of the strong uptrend in prices, the Inro five-day moving
average has risen to 171.66 Malaysian/Singapore cents a kilogram, compared
with an eight-year low in natural rubber prices of 156.31
Malaysian/Singapore cents at the end of September.
Traders say there has been a fall off in production in Malaysia, Thailand
and, to a lesser extent, Indonesia because of an extended monsoon season.
Malaysia's 1993 production is estimated to have fallen to 1.19m tonnes from
1.22m tonnes in 1992.
Traders say buying in of more than 20,000 tonnes of natural rubber by the
Inro buffer stock manager at the end of last year also helped prices. The
Inro natural rubber stockpile is now estimated at slightly more than 200,000
tonnes.
