FT  12 MAR 92 / MMC threat to British Gas lifted


   By DAVID LASCELLES


SIR GORDON BORRIE, director-general of fair trading, yesterday lifted his
threat to refer British Gas to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission in
return for undertakings from the company to withdraw from more than half of
the UK industrial and commercial gas market, David Lascelles writes.
British Gas, which had been resisting the Office of Fair Trading's efforts
to make it reduce the extent of its dominance of the UK gas business,
promised to implement the agreement 'in a constructive spirit and orderly
manner'.
British Gas will reduce its share of the industrial and commercial market
from 95 per cent to 40 per cent by 1995 by handing over the difference to
new shippers.
At the same time, it will split its pipeline and storage operations from the
rest of its business. They will form an independent unit which will provide
equal treatment to British Gas and other shippers. A transparent pricing
system is to be drawn up.
The Gas Consumers' Council said the success of the deal depended on whether
British Gas would be able to recover lost profits by raising gas prices.
'New challenges face the regulators in ensuring that shareholders do not
benefit at the expense of the customers,' said Mr Ian Powe, its director.
