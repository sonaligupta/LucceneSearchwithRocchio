FT  30 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Scargill attacked by NUM official


   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor


MR Arthur Scargill, president of the National Union of Mineworkers,
yesterday faced an unusually direct attack on his leadership from one of his
own officials who said he had brought the union 'close to extinction'.
Mr Peter Neilson, vice-president of the Scottish area, told the union's
annual conference in Scarborough that Mr Scargill was 'totally out of touch'
with his members and that the union had 'stumbled from one defeat to
another, continually losing credibility while slowly sinking into oblivion'.
The Scottish area of the union has been one of the most outspoken in
attacking Mr Scargill but rarely in front of him and never in such outspoken
language at a union conference.
The object of Mr Neilson's attack was the NUM's refusal to negotiate over
pay with British Coal for the past nine years because of the 'majority'
principle.
This allows the rival Union of Democratic Mineworkers to represent NUM
members in pits where the UDM has a majority.
He said the NUM was failing its members 'miserably' and was not carrying out
the basic principle of trade unionism to protect and improve wages. 'Whether
we like it or not the UDM does exist and to deny that is to fool yourself
and do your members a disservice,' he added.
Mr Scargill said he was 'saddened' by the attack.
In spite of Mr Neilson's remarks, Mr Scargill appears to have settled into
the president's job for another five years because of the unwillingness of
any NUM member to take legal action against him.
Under trade union laws Mr Scargill should have been re-elected in January,
five years after his initial election.
