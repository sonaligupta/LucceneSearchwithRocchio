FT  25 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Epwin at Pounds 2.9m and makes cash call


EPWIN GROUP, the USM-quoted maker of uPVC windows and doors, sealed double
glazed units and glass products, yesterday reported annual profits ahead of
expectations at Pounds 2.91m.
The company also announced, that along with a 1-for-4 rights issue to fund
expansion, it was to apply for its shares to be admitted to the official
list.
Mr Jim Rawson, chairman and managing director, said the combination of a
rights issue and a move to the main market should increase the marketability
of the shares to a wider range of UK and European institutions.
He said that profits for the 12 months to end-December, although down by
Pounds 600,000 from last year, were satisfactory considering difficult
trading conditions.
The result came on turnover down from Pounds 47.8m to Pounds 40.3m. Earnings
per share emerged at 12.8p (15.5p). The final dividend is increased to 4.5p
for a total for the year up from 6.4p to 6.6p.
Mr Rawson said the rights issue would raise about Pounds 5.4m after
expenses, which would be used to expand production facilities, improve
efficiency and widen the customer base.
The rights issue is underwritten by County NatWest. Cazenove is broker to
the issue.
