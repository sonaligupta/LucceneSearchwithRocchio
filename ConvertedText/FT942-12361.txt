FT  29 APR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Coffee claws back losses - Market
Report


   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES and REUTER


The July COFFEE futures price rose by Dollars 45 a tonne yesterday to
Dollars 1,521 a tonne in London as the market clawed back previous days'
losses and prices were pushed up by strong fund buying in New York, writes
Deborah Hargreaves.
The market shrugged off confirmation of Brazil's plans to sell 2.4m bags
from its government stockpile this year and the news that exporters could
take part in the auction if the price reached 85 cents per pound.
Traders said fundamentally tight supplies of coffee were continuing to fuel
the market's rise and attracting speculative buying. The producers'
retention scheme has helped create a rundown in stocks of coffee held by
consumers.
COPPER led a general rise at the London Metal Exchange as it mounted a
successful assault on resistance at Dollars 1,930 a tonne, for three months
delivery, reports Reuter.
Dealers said the rise, which took the three months delivery position to
Dollars 1,936, up Dollars 16, in after hours trading, was encouraged by
trade buying and covering against short positions, plus some option-related
covering.
