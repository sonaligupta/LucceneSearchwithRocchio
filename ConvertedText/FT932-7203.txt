FT  25 MAY 93 / UK Company News: National advertising boosts Radio Clyde


   By CATHERINE MILTON


RADIO Clyde Holdings, the USM-quoted broadcaster, lifted half-year pre-tax
profits from Pounds 843,000 to Pounds 1.53m as national advertising revenue
grew rapidly. The rise was helped by the adoption of FRS 3 and the
restatement of last year's figure.
Exceptional gains totalled Pounds 273,000 including the release of a prior
year's provision, against charges of Pounds 270,000. The company said
exceptional credits for the full-year would reach Pounds 615,000.
Turnover improved to Pounds 7.06m (Pounds 6.62m) in the six months to March
31 with advertising and sponsorship at 90 per cent of sales. Local revenue,
which made up two-thirds of the income, rose 4 per cent while national
revenue increased by 20 per cent.
Mr John Bowman, finance director, said: 'Local revenue is at a record level
for us. National revenue is recovering from the sharp drops we have seen
recently.' The company noted that advertising revenues could be volatile,
but said trading since the half-way stage showed 'satisfactory growth'.
Operating profits rose to Pounds 1.15m (Pounds 970,000). Net interest
received fell to Pounds 98,000 (Pounds 143,000) reflecting the drop in
interest rates. The company had Pounds 3.06m (Pounds 2.72m) cash, having
generated Pounds 569,000 from operating activities.
Radio Clyde has committed Pounds 160,000 for its 40 per cent stake in
Carlisle Radio which went on the air in April, in an area 'largely unserved
by independent radio'.
The company has also decided to take a leading stake in a consortium
application for the North-West regional licence. If successful the company
will put in Pounds 640,000 towards starting up the station.
The board declared an interim dividend of 3.5p (3.25p). from earnings per
share of 12p (5.4p).
