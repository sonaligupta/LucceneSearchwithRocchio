FT  07 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Dixons shakes retailers


   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and CLARE GASCOIGNE


Worries over retail sales in the run-up to Christmas were confirmed
yesterday as electrical retailer Dixons revealed poor first-half results and
issued a profits warning.
Dixons shares dived on the news, which also sent shivers through the rest of
the stores sector and initially pushed several leading stocks down. By the
close, Dixons had plunged 43 to 240p, its biggest one-day fall since October
1987, with a hefty 13m shares traded.
With stores shares under pressure, there was growing expectations in the
market that other retailers would be forced into making Christmas trading
statements. Kingfisher was one widely tipped to make an announcement
shortly. The stock tumbled 15 to 747p as investors worried over its Comet
electrical division after Dixons warned that sales of computer games and
camcorders had been weak. Also hit were Argos, off 3 at 374p, GUS, down 9 at
628p, and Burton, 1 1/2 adrift at 68 1/2 p.
Analysts moved quickly to cut 1994 profits forecasts for Dixons. BZW reduced
its estimate by 15 per cent to Pounds 75m. Analyst Mr Tony Shiret said the
main concern was Dixons' weak gross margins, which appeared to be under
continuing pressure. UBS lowered its forecast back to Pounds 77m, while
Panmure Gordon pulled its figure down to Pounds 70m. For the following year,
the range was between Pounds 87m and Pounds 95m.
However, many other stores stocks later recovered as analysts digested the
detail of the Dixons results, much of which was deemed specific to the
group, and were then treated to improved figures from Boots. After being
down 18 at one stage, its shares recovered to close just 5 off at 582p. High
street clothes chains continued to be supported by market talk of better
December sales and firmer margins.
