FT  15 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help lift Chemring to Pounds
6.5m


   By GEOFF DYER


Acquisitions helped Chemring, the maker of anti-missile decoys, marine
distress products and protective clothing, increase pre-tax profits by 14
per cent in the year to September 30.
The outcome of Pounds 6.49m (Pounds 5.71m), achieved on turnover up 35 per
cent at Pounds 53.1m (Pounds 39.4m), absorbed redundancy costs of Pounds
173,000 which had led to a 2.3 per cent fall in interim profits. Operating
profit on continuing business was up 8 per cent at Pounds 6.28m (Pounds
5.8m), on turnover 25 per cent higher at Pounds 49.3m.
Mr Philip Billington, chairman, said that all the group's businesses had
shown growth.
The group acquired Kembrey, a maker of electronic marine search products and
cable harnesses, in September for Pounds 4.8m, Hutchwilco, a New Zealand
supplier of buoyancy aids, in May for Pounds 1.5m and Nova Marine Systems, a
manufacturer of electronic marine search products, for Pounds 1.1m in April.
As a result, the proportion of turnover from the defence sector fell from 60
per cent to 41 per cent.
A 1-for-10 open offer in August raised Pounds 5.5m to pay off debt used for
the acquisitions.
Earnings per share increased to 21.3p (19.3p). The final dividend is 6.56p,
making 9.8p (9p) for the year.
