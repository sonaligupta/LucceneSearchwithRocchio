FT  20 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Birkby expands via I-Mex acquisition


   By TIM BURT


Birkby, the space management and hire purchase group, has accelerated its
expansion programme with the acquisition of I-Mex Group, a privately-owned
manager of commercial and light industrial units.
Birkby, which established a national presence earlier this year with the
Pounds 58.7m purchase of In-Shops, has agreed to pay a nominal sum for
I-Mex; it will also repay its property mortgages and acquire its outstanding
debts.
I-Mex made operating profits of Pounds 731,000 (losses of Pounds 4.46m) in
the year to March 31.
The deal follows a debt reduction agreement between Birkby and Hill Samuel,
the mortgage lender on 14 of I-Mex's 18 workspace centres.
Mr Kim Taylor-Smith, Birkby's deputy chief executive, said Hill Samuel had
agreed to reduce I-Mex's debt from Pounds 31.2m to Pounds 19.3m. Of that,
Birkby will repay Pounds 7.87m from existing cash resources and raise a
further Pounds 11.4m through the placing of 4.43m new shares at 257p.
'This was an opportunity to acquire quality workspace at an attractive
price, and it will allow us to expand our concept in the north of England
and the Midlands,' he said.
The I-Mex portfolio also includes an interest in two space management
projects in the Netherlands.
In addition to the placing, handled by Charterhouse Tilney Securities, Bank
of Scotland has agreed to extend Pounds 3.1m of a Pounds 5m term loan
facility owed by I-Mex. The balance is expected to be repaid from group
resources following the acquisition.
