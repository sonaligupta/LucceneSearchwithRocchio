FT  09 JAN 92 / Company plans prove costly


BRITISH companies spend considerable time and money preparing corporate
plans but frequently fail to follow them through, according to a survey by
3i, the UK's largest venture capital company.
Of 174 companies polled, 76 per cent drew up formal corporate plans but one
in three said they failed to follow them through, 47 per cent of companies
said they adhered to their planning guidelines to start with but later
diverged and only 13 per cent stuck closely to the guidelines.
