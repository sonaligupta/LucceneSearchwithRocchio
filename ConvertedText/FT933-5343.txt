AMCOR, the Australian paper and packaging group, has increased sales,
earnings and dividends in the year ended June, despite recession in many of
its key markets.
The company yesterday announced an 18 per cent net profit rise to ADollars
314.9m (USDollars 212.7m) on a 17 per cent sales lift to ADollars 4.82bn.
The dividend is going up from 29 cents to 31 cents. Earnings benefited from
extra liquidity following the sale of the remaining interest in former
transport associate Mayne Nickless.
Asset disposals produced an ADollars 68.5m abnormal gain.
