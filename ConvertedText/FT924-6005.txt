FT  24 NOV 92 / BBC green paper expected today


THE delayed green paper on the BBC is expected to be published today. The
discussion document will be mainly in the form of options, although there
will be a presumption that the BBC's licence could continue in return for
maximum efficiency.
The main area of controversy is likely to surround a suggestion that licence
fee funds might be made more generally available to those making
public-service programmes, not just the BBC.
Mr Chris Hopson, in a paper for the European Policy Forum think tank, said
that would be a Trojan horse for those who wanted to dismantle the
corporation.
