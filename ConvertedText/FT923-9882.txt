FT  03 AUG 92 / Congo ballot for leader


   By AP


   BRAZZAVILLE


Thousands of people lined up to vote for a new leader in the former
Marxist-Leninist state of Congo yesterday in the first contested
presidential ballot since 1963, AP reports from Brazzaville.
Voting was slow but peaceful, except for one incident in which young people
attacked a police station they said was holding the national identity cards
they needed to vote.
Among leading contenders is discredited President Denis Sassou-Nguesso, the
former Marxist military ruler who was stripped of all but ceremonial powers
last year by a national conference for democracy. It accused him of
assassinating opponents and stealing state money, but decided to forgive
him. He retains the support of the army and has been locked in a power
struggle with Prime Minister Andre Milongo, another contender who has led an
interim government to organise elections.
