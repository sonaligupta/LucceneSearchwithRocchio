FT  12 APR 94 / Shipyard challenge to curbs on work


   By CHRIS TIGHE


The company which bought Sunderland's last shipyard is challenging the
government's insistence that no shipbuilding, conversion or repair work can
resume there before January 1999.
Pallion Engineering, the UK-Greek company which took over the Pallion yard
in 1991, is taking legal advice on the terms of the deal under which it
acquired the site following the closure in the late 1980s of Wearside's last
shipyards.
Mr Alan Dickinson, chairman, yesterday said the Greek shipowners that are
Pallion Engineering's main stakeholders wanted to have their vessels
repaired there, creating several hundred jobs.
Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, has told Mr Bill Etherington, MP for
Sunderland North, that the terms of Pallion's lease preclude resumption of
shipbuilding and related activities until 1999.
Mr Dickinson said Pallion had understood that the European Commission's
10-year ban on shipbuilding, imposed as a condition of sanctioning a Pounds
45m 'rescue package' for Sunderland, could be reviewed after five years.
CMN, the French company negotiating to buy Swan Hunter, the Tyneside
shipbuilder in receivership, expects it will take at least a fortnight to
complete the technical and legal matters needed before it can enter into a
contractual agreement with receivers Price Waterhouse.
