FT  23 JUL 93 / World Trade News: US-Japan trade stakes raised - Gephardt
plans move to force president's hand


   By NANCY DUNNE


   WASHINGTON


CONGRESSMAN Richard Gephardt, majority leader in the US House of
Representatives, said yesterday he would introduce legislation in September
requiring the administration to enforce the US-Japan negotiating framework
agreement reached at the Tokyo economic summit.
While praising President Bill Clinton for getting 'serious' about the US
trade deficit with Japan, he scoffed at the Japanese government's claim that
it could not force liberalisation on the private sector. 'Often it is
impossible to determine where the government leaves off and the private
sector begins,' he said.
His legislation would require the US government to issue yearly assessments
of US-Japan sectoral agreements, set industry targets for market access and
levy sanctions if the Japanese still keep their market closed.
It will 'short-circuit the investigation phase' in a trade complaint 'and go
immediately to consultations. . . If any agreement can't be reached, action
would occur'.
The support of Mr Gephardt, the most influential House member on trade
issues, is vitally important to Mr Clinton. The two have spent hours
discussing the North American Free Trade Agreement, but the congressman is
still threatening to oppose the pact unless it satisfies his concerns about
jobs and the environment.
He insists that he will not support 'an agreement that isn't paid for'.
