FT  10 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Pharmaceuticals


The perplexing strength of the UK pharmaceutical sector continues. Glaxo,
Fisons and Wellcome went up 4 per cent yesterday, SmithKline Beecham 3 per
cent. Considering Wellcome and Glaxo were also the FT-SE's best performers
last year, this might suggest the UK market is still in defensive mood. But
the FT-SE's top performers this year so far are all bombed-out high
yielders: Lonrho, Trafalgar House and Guardian Royal Exchange.
The paradox may be partly explained by an appetite for UK drug stocks among
US investors. They might perhaps reflect that whereas their own drug sector
outperformed the US market by only 28 per cent last year, the UK sector
outperformed by 50 per cent. This was chiefly determined by the performance
of Glaxo, which accounts for half the sector by value. But Glaxo's strength
last year was partly due to belated realisation of the promise of its new
drug portfolio. The trouble now is that while the clinical potential of
these drugs has become clear, it is too early to assess their commercial
potential, Zofran excepted. It might be recalled that in mid-1983, when the
promise of Zantac was first fully appreciated, the shares reached their
highest ever multiple of 32. They are now on a multiple of 27. Whether Glaxo
can repeat the growth of the early days of Zantac from a vastly bigger base
is open to doubt. It should also be recalled that in the second half of
1983, Glaxo underperformed the market by 30 per cent.
