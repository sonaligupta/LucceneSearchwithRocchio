FT  03 AUG 92 / International Company News: San Miguel lifts income 3% in
first six months

SAN MIGUEL Corporation, the largest private enterprise in the Philippines,
has announced a 3 per cent increase in its first-half net income to 1.56bn
pesos (Dollars 63.6m).
Consolidated net sales totalled 28.8bn pesos, up 15 per cent from the same
period last year. Before extraordinary expenses arising mainly from its
employee-separation programme, consolidated net income was up 42 per cent at
1.67bn pesos,
San Miguel has been cutting its labour force in unprofitable activities,
particularly in some of its packaging lines. About 2,000 of its 36,000
employees are expected to be affected by the retrenchment.
The company said sales for the full year could be about 15 per cent higher
than last year, in spite of government talk of raising taxes on beer and
soft drinks, San Miguel's main product lines which account for about 60 per
cent of annual turnover.
Successive increases in the ad valorem tax on beer since late 1990, which
hit 60 per cent at the beginning of 1991, hurt San Miguel sales.
'We have not fully recovered from the volume declines in sales since then,'
the company said.
