FT  14 APR 94 / International Company News: Winter Olympics help CBS lift
income 28%

   NEW YORK


A strong boost from its highly successful coverage of the Winter Olympics
helped CBS, the US broadcasting group, report a 28 per cent increase in net
income to Dollars 69.3m from Dollars 54.2m in its first quarter.
During the Olympics, the CBS Television Network had two weeks of the highest
ratings it has yet recorded.
Largely as a result of this event, net sales for the group surged by 42 per
cent to Dollars 1.25bn from the comparable quarter's Dollars 878.7m. CBS
said that if the effect of the Olympics were excluded, sales would have been
about 6 per cent ahead.
Earnings per share rose by 21 per cent to Dollars 4.23 from Dollars 3.50
last time.
The CBS Television Stations division was the biggest beneficiary of the
Olympics coverage, with sales and profits ahead very strongly.
In addition, CBS said, the improving US economy had brought substantial
strengthened demand for local advertising. Sales growth was particularly
strong at WCBS-TV New York and WCIX-TV Miami.
Local and spot radio sales also benefited from more robust business
conditions, and CBS Radio reported better operating results led by improved
sales and earnings at the AM group of stations.
Mr Laurence Tisch, chairman and chief executive, said that the group's
operating results continued to show steady improvement, reflecting the
combined effect of a strong programming schedule, strengthened demand for
advertising and active cost control.
He said that the CBS Television Network was heading towards 'an exceptional
triple crown' in winning the ratings in prime time, day time and late night
television in the current season.
