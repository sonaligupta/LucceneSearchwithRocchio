FT  17 JAN 92 / Korean police surround Hyundai car plants


   By REUTER


   SEOUL


SOUTH KOREAN riot police yesterday surrounded the troubled Hyundai car
plants where defiant union workers, armed with steel pipes, settled down for
a drawn-out occupation, Reuter reports from Seoul.
'We have hundreds of police outside the plants keeping watch. And over 1,000
more are coming from Pusan,' said the police in the nearby south-eastern
city of Ulsan.
Workers sporting red headbands built elaborate barricades at the 13 main
gates, using two fire engines, cars, tyres and doors, and ordered company
officials and non-union workers out of the main buildings.
Hyundai ordered the plants to close temporarily from today after unionists
voted on Tuesday to upgrade a five-month dispute into full-time industrial
action.
The company said Hyundai would withhold 70 per cent of workers' salaries
during the closure.
The union said workers were demanding the release of several employees
arrested in sporadic labour disputes five months ago. They want 11 unionists
sacked this year - for what the company said was illegal labour activity -
to be reinstated.
The union had threatened to begin a full-scale strike from next Monday if
the management rejected its demands.
