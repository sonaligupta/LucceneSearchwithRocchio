FT  29 JUL 92 / Funds 'back equities over gilts': Pension survey shows bonds
switch


   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent


PENSION FUND managers have increased their exposure to equities over the
past five years, while equities have been performing less well than gilts,
according to a survey of the fund management industry.
'Much has been made of the attractions of bonds vis-a-vis equities in the
current economic climate. Thus far, pension funds have only paid lip service
to this,' according to consulting actuaries Hymans Robertson in their 1992
Pension Fund Investment Manager Survey.
The survey included 98 managers with over Pounds 180bn of segregated pension
money under management and over Pounds 500bn of total funds under
management. The total UK pension fund market is estimated at roughly Pounds
300bn.
Mr George Henshilwood, partner and consulting actuary, said that in the five
years to June 30 this year equities produced 6 per cent a year, markedly
lower than UK government gilts, which produced 9.5 per cent annually.
While pension fund managers predicted an increase in fixed-interest returns
relative to equities, the average UK fund actually increased equities
weightings to 60 per cent of holdings from 55 per cent at the end of 1986.
The category seeing the greatest inflow of funds was overseas equities,
which have produced negative annual returns of 0.3 per cent.
'It may be that UK fund managers cannot pick overseas equities as well as
they can pick domestic ones,' Mr Henshilwood said. While poor returns in
Japanese equities might be explained by market conditions, UK managers
consistently underperformed key US indices with stock selection in that
market, he said.
The 1992 survey also disclosed a sharp increase in fee scales for balanced
funds of about 15 per cent on average. Fees have been increased despite
rising competition for fund management mandates. Mr Henshilwood said the
rises have been led by the larger, sought-after fund managers whose track
records have allowed them to be more selective in accepting clients.
The survey found the five largest pension fund managers unchanged, although
there have been significant shifts in their market shares. The five are
Mercury Asset Management (19 per cent market share), Phillips and Drew Fund
Managers (11 per cent), Schroder (9 per cent), BZW Investment Management (5
per cent) and Robert Fleming Asset Management (5 per cent). Of those, BZWIM
and Fleming fail to appear in the list of the top 10 most consistent
performers among UK balanced segregated fund managers over the past five
years. Both also lost market share over the past year.
