FT  30 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Volkswagen slips a further
3.5% in Frankfurt


US consumer confidence data had a marked effect on late-closing bourses
across the Continent. The 'no' vote in Norway's EU referendum was already
largely discounted.
FRANKFURT weakened in slow trade, the DAX index losing 14.17 at 2,044.28. In
the Ibis the index fell to 2,036.24, pressured by the US data.
Volkswagen again came under selling pressure, dropping DM15.60 to DM425.60,
even though the vehicle manufacturer said that its worldwide sales had risen
by 5.5 per cent in October.
Smith New Court has turned positive on German retailers, arguing that while
1994 results were liable to be unexciting, a recovery in domestic
consumption in the second half of 1995 would trigger a rerating of the
sector. The broker noted that the sector had underperformed the market by
some 20 per cent since 1991.
'Our preference within the sector is to stay away from food retail (too
competitive) and department stores (declining market shares) and prefer
larger retail formats or specialist retailers which have further scope for
expansion or exhibit more cyclicality.'
In the sector yesterday, Asko rose DM10 to DM725, Douglas lost DM6 to DM409,
Karstadt put on DM0.60 to DM550 and Kaufhof added DM2 at DM41.
PARIS was also affected by the news from New York, and the CAC-40 index
dipped 12.41 to 1,939.97 in turnover of just under FFr3bn.
Renault eased FFr1 to FFr180 as some investors took profits following the
recent privat-isation. The government said the offer of shares to Renault
employees had been 95 per cent oversubscribed.
Cap Gemini Sogeti eased FFr8.30 to FFr180.90 following reports that
Daimler-Benz might reduce its stake.
MILAN was on hold, awaiting the outcome of yesterday's marathon session of
the cabinet, and the Comit index edged 0.25 lower to 626.96 in a second day
of very low volumes.
Attention continued to focus on Credito Italiano, L12 off at L1,560, as the
chairman met the head of the stock market regulator, Consob, amid mounting
speculation that Italiano was about to make an announcement over its bid for
control of Credito Romagnolo.
After the market closed, Italiano said details of its proposal would be
released once it had the go-ahead to proceed from the necessary authorities.
The Consob said Romagnolo's shares, suspended for the last two days, would
resume trading today.
Ferruzzi picked up L39 or 3.1 per cent to L1,294 amid rumours that Serafino,
the Ferruzzi family holding, might renounce some of the credits owed by
Ferruzzi.
AMSTERDAM could not maintain Monday's progress and the AEX index receded
1.70 to 406.74.
Unilever, up 90 cents to Fl 195.80, attracted a positive note from James
Capel following the company's recent third-quarter results. The broker
commented that 'a better than forecast underlying performance should offset
the likely currency negative, and we have retained our full-year forecast of
Fl 4.144bn net income'.
Nedlloyd firmed 40 cents to Fl 51.60 ahead of today's third-quarter results,
which are expected to show net profits of between Fl 30m to Fl 40m.
ZURICH edged higher in quiet trade, with the market supported by demand for
heavily weighted index stocks. The SMI index rose 5.3 to 2,584.7, with the
easier dollar and lower bond futures acting as restraining influences.
Roche certificates firmed SFr65 to SFr5,840 and Nestle added SFr9 at
SFr1,215. Both were said to be targets of large foreign buy orders. UBS
bearers continued to recoup some of their recent loss, rising SFr8 to
SFr1,138.
MADRID was lower across the board and the general index gave up 3.10 or 1
per cent to 299.76. Repsol fell Pta60 or 1.6 per cent to Pta3,775, still
suffering from reports earlier in the week that a Pta2 cut in petroleum
products prices was still being considered by the government.
Endesa ended Pta120 lower at Pta5,860 amid local press reports that the
state-run electric utility was a candidate in the possible purchase of a 20
per cent stake in Cepsa from Banco Central Hispano.
OSLO finished slightly higher after the country voted against joining the
European Union in Monday's referendum. The All-share index gained 2.0 at
610.6 in brisk turnover of NKr479m, after dropping early in the day in
immediate reaction to the vote.
Analysts noted that interest rates slipped and the crown firmed against
European currencies as uncertainties vanished and the government said it
would maintain a tight economic policy.
A 'no' note had been largely factored into the market as opinion polls in
recent months had shown EU opponents leading comfortably, with supporters
apparently gaining ground only over the last week.
Orkla 'B' rose NKr12.50 to NKr205 and the 'A' NKr11 to NKr215. The company
was among the few blue chips to campaign against EU membership, because the
heavily protected domestic food and drink market had a particular importance
for it.
STOCKHOLM was mixed, having tried to resist rising debt market yields and a
fall by Ericsson in late trading. The Affarsvarlden index finished just 1.4
ahead at 1,504.2.
A SKr7.50 fall to SKr417.50 in Ericsson 'B' was attributed to the
cancellation of a SKr100m contract to supply a high capacity optical fibre
transmission network.
