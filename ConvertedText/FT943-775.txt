FT  28 SEP 94 / High cost of backing rouble

The Russian Central Bank spent Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.6bn) in the past two
months on intervention to support the rouble, reducing its foreign exchange
reserves to below Dollars 5bn, a senior bank official said yesterday. 'It's
good for the central bank to raise its currency reserves but it means
pumping roubles into the market, fuelling inflation,' deputy central bank
chairman Alexander Khandruyev told a news conference. 'By cutting our
reserves by Dollars 2.5bn we have introduced a stabilising element into the
economy.' The rouble fell to a record low of 2,476 to the dollar on the
Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange earlier, with the central bank refraining
from intervention. Last week it dropped 5 per cent to the previous record
low of 2,460 as the central bank stayed on the sidelines.
