FT  15 APR 94 / Arts: Today's Television


   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY


Can Dylan Winter, co-star with Molly the packhorse in the Radio 4 series 'A
Hack In The Borders', follow the path trodden by such erstwhile radio
personalities as Christopher Morrison and Anne Robinson and become a
television star? We shall see, when he presents the first in the series
Secret Service. Winter goes undercover to test the customer friendliness of
five organisations, beginning with Burger King and Ansells pubs (7.00 BBC1).
Like public schools, 'the public interest' usually means the opposite of
what it says. When bureaucrats refuse to tell you what you want to know,
citing 'the public interest', it is almost invariably private interests
which are under threat. Public Eye reports on Jean Bennett's attempts to
find out why the police killed her son (8.00 BBC2).
You knew stand-up comedian Jo Brand was sensitive about being very fat. You
knew that as a woman she is licensed to make sexist jokes. But had you ever
been told she used to work in a mental hospital? Jo Brand Through The Cake
Hole (10.30 C4).
