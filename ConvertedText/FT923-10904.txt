FT  28 JUL 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report


   By REUTER


COPPER prices yesterday continued the downtrend that set in late last week
at the London Metal Exchange, with the cash price closing Pounds 13 down at
Pounds 1,327.50 a tonne. However, most of the fall was attributable to
sterling's firmness against the dollar. Dealers noted that the three months
price held just above expected support at the equivalent of Dollars 2,540 a
tonne. Earlier the market was boosted by news that Polish copper workers
planned to step up their strike action and the three months price reached
Dollars 2,562 a tonne in the morning. Three months TIN came under heavy
pressure in afternoon trading and closed Dollars 110 down on the day at
Dollars 6,932.50 a tonne, in the process moving from a Dollars 27.50 premium
over the cash price to a Dollars 62.50 discount and breaching key support at
Dollars 7,000 a tonne. With charts weak further declines seemed to be on the
cards, dealers said.
PLATINUM continued on the downswing of its recent price pendulum, with the
afternoon fixing at Dollars 377.50 a tonne, down Dollars 2.85 on the day and
only 25 cents above last week's three-week low. The price rallied in later
trading but dealers thought it could slip back to test support at Dollars
375 and then Dollars 372 before rebounding.
