FT  04 SEP 93 / UK Company News: China and Eastern leaps


   By SIMON DAVIES

CHINA and Eastern Fund, the first closed-end fund to focus on China,
reported a rise in net profits from Dollars 462,834 to Dollars 1.35m (Pounds
890,000) for the year to July.
Net assets rose 8 per cent to Dollars 53.8m, representing Dollars 2.64
(Dollars 2.43)per share.
The fund was launched on the Stock Exchange in 1985 to invest in listed and
unlisted investments which would benefit from the opening up of the Chinese
economy.
The company had a mixed performance from its direct investments, and as a
result of the development of China's own stock markets and the growth in
listed Chinese companies in Hong Kong, it is now focusing on listed
companies.
During the past financial year, its investment valuations were hit by
falling B share prices on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets, set
against strong performances from Hong Kong-listed China stocks.
Lord Marsh, chairman, said he was confident of an increasing interest in
Chinese investment. 'If you take a long-term view, the likelihood is that
China will become a major player in Asia and it understands the need to
adapt its business practices to an internationally-recognised capitalist
system,' he said.
China and Eastern has also broadened its focus to include other Asian-listed
companies with substantial business in China and has investments in the
Korean, Malaysian and Singaporean stock markets.
The recommended final dividend goes up to 6 cents (2 cents).
