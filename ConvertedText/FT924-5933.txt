FT  24 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Whitegate deeper in red


WHITEGATE Leisure, which operates in the leisure, healthcare and property
sectors, announced a sharp increase to Pounds 2.95m in losses before tax for
the eight months to August 31. In the preceding 12 months the group incurred
losses of Pounds 1.09m.
Losses per ordinary share for the period were 10.2p against 4.2p for the
whole of 1991.
There was a group operating profit of Pounds 626,000 (Pounds 3.78m) for the
eight months but this was coverted into the deficit after a French operating
loss of Pounds 645,000 (Pounds 372,000) and property losses of Pounds 19,000
(Pounds 97,000 profits). Healthcare made profits of Pounds 144,000 (Pounds
20,000).
Mr James Oppenheim, chairman, said improved trading results, disposal of the
loss making French businesses - five of the six French discotheques were
sold earlier this month - and lower interest rates should lead to improved
results for the current year. The healthcare business is also to be sold
shortly.
