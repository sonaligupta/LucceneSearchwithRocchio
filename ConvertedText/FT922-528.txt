FT  27 JUN 92 / Challenge to German abortion law


   By QUENTIN PEEL


   BONN


OPPONENTS of a liberalised abortion law in Germany will challenge it in the
constitutional court in Karlsruhe, following a clear majority vote in favour
in the Bundestag early yesterday morning.
The Roman Catholic church also promised to continue its campaign to prevent
the law being put into effect.
The compromise agreed yesterday by a vote of 357-284, after 14 hours of
debate and two hours of voting, would allow a pregnancy to be terminated up
to 12 weeks from conception, provided the mother had been given formal
counselling at least three days before the operation.
An attempt by a majority of the Christian Democrats and Christian Social
Union in the Bundestag to pass an alternative, which would in effect
maintain the present highly-restrictive West German abortion law, failed to
gain the necessary absolute majority.
A new law was necessary following German unification, to reconcile the
virtual abortion-on-demand in east Germany with the western prohibition,
unleashing a stormy two-year long debate.
