FT  05 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Questions on Italy's laws on
takeovers still unanswered


   By HAIG SIMONIAN


   MILAN


CONSOB, Italy's stock market and companies watchdog, yesterday fleshed out
some of the missing parts of the country's new laws on public share
offerings and takeover bids for quoted companies, passed earlier this year.
However, many crucial questions, such as the detailed conditions for
triggering a takeover bid and precisely how such a transaction would work,
remained unanswered.
The continuing lack of such information has unsettled the Milan stock
market. After a brief speculative burst based on hopes that the new rules,
which are supposed to protect the rights of minority shareholders in quoted
companies, could push up the values of some stocks, interest has once again
dwindled.
Under the new rules, which went into effect in early March, Consob had a
three-month limit to clarify information requirements for public share
offerings - which it has now done.
But details about takeover bids did not face the same deadline, and have
still to be resolved. The new takeover law, passed in haste by Italy's
outgoing legislature, has been criticised by brokers as imperfect and
difficult to interpret. But a Consob official yesterday could give no
indication when the rules might be clarified.
Simint, the quoted clothing company controlled by financier Mr Francesco
Micheli and designer Mr Giorgio Armani, is raising L60bn (Dollars 48.8m)
through a capital increase.
