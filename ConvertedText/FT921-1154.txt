FT  25 MAR 92 / Election 1992: FT Election Share Index


THE prevailing pattern since the election was called reasserted itself
yesterday, as shares that might benefit from a Labour win outperformed those
that might do better if the government remained unchanged.
'Labour gainers' rose by less than the FT-SE index, but are still less than
a percentage point below the level at which they started.
