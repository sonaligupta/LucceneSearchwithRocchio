FT  06 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Pathfinder forecasts recovery at Ruberoid


   By CATHERINE MILTON


RUBEROID, the roofing subsidiary Tarmac is spinning off to the market,
yesterday forecast a return to pre-tax profitability for the current year.
The pathfinder prospectus published yesterday also reveals that Tarmac has
indemnified the company to the tune of Pounds 6m in case of claims over
environmental contamination at some sites in The Netherlands and Belgium.
Expert advice was that this sum would be more than adequate in the worst
case. Mr Ian McPherson, chief executive, said: 'If this business was being
floated in the normal way, shareholders would not have these indemnities.
Ruberoid is coming out clean.'
He estimated that the sites potentially affected account for between 10 per
cent and 15 per cent of turnover and said: 'We are not out of compliance
anywhere.' Precise costs were difficult to assess but previous and adjoining
land owners may be at least partly liable.
Ruberoid said pre-tax profits would be Pounds 7m for the 12 months to
December 1993. Losses rose to Pounds 12.8m (Pounds 6.7m) in the year to
December 31 1992 on turnover of Pounds 280.4m (Pounds 263.8m).
That was after provisions of Pounds 11.3m (Pounds 6.9m) with the bulk
against redundancy and reorganisation as well as some to cover poor contract
results. There was a notional interest charge of Pounds 6.1m (Pounds 6.8m).
No exceptional items are forecast for 1993 and the interest charge is likely
to be just below Pounds 1m following a refinancing which should ensure an
average gearing of about 10 per cent during the year.
Shares will be firmly placed with institutions. Up to 35 per cent may be
clawed back by the public offer for sale. The issue values the company at
about Pounds 70m.
Robert Fleming is sponsor and Robert Fleming Securities are brokers. The
prospectus is to be published on November 11, with the offer closing on
November 18.
