FT  29 JAN 92 / Moves made on pay disclosures


BRITAIN'S largest companies have begun to disclose more information in
annual reports about boardroom pay, but many need to be more open, according
to Monks Partnership, the independent remuneration advisers which today
launched a set of guidelines for directors' pay disclosure.
Over the past two years the proportion of Britain's largest companies that
disclose more than the statutory minimum about boardroom pay had increased
from about 30 per cent to over 50 per cent, said Mr Tony Vernon-Harcourt,
author of the guide.
