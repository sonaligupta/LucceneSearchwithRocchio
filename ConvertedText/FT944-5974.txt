FT  01 DEC 94 / Island trader runs out of puff


A small cargo ship said to be worth Pounds 200,000 is being offered free to
anyone prepared to continue using it to provide a service to the islands off
north-west Scotland.
The 66ft, 230-tonne Eilean Eisdeal is the last working Clyde puffer - a
class of boat which once traded along the north-west seaboard and among the
islands. It can carry 132 tonnes of cargo and has a top speed of eight knots
unladen.
Mr Chris Nicholson is being forced to end the service after losses of more
than Pounds 660,000 since he restored the 'Easy' in 1983.
Most of the hundreds of puffers went to the scrapyards on the arrival of
roll-on, roll-off services operated by state-owned Caledonian MacBrayne in
the late 1960s.
Mr Nicholson's company, Easdale Island Shipping Line, spotted what it
thought was a gap in the market in the 1980s. The government awarded the
company tariff rebate eligibility in 1986 which it thought would make it
competitive against the CalMac's largely lorry-based delivery services.
But the business lost money from its inception and has been forced into
voluntary liquidation.
The puffer's last run was between the island of Eriskay, in the Outer
Hebrides, and Tobermory on Mull, where it was laid up, the crew was laid
off, and a wake held in the public bar of the Mishnish Hotel.
