FT  27 JAN 94 / International Company News: Sunkyong takes 23% stake in
Korean telephone network


   By JOHN BURTON


   SEOUL


Sunkyong, South Korea's fifth-largest business group, has acquired a 23 per
cent stake in Korea Mobile Telecom (KMT), the country's cellular telephone
network, in a Won437bn (Dollars 540m) bid.
Shares in KMT were auctioned this week as part of a privatisation programme
by Korea Telecom, the state-controlled telecommunications operator. Korea
Telecom will retain a 20 per cent stake in KMT.
Sunkyong was the only investor whose bid was accepted from 292 applications
for 44 per cent of KMT. The rest of the bids were too low and a new auction
will soon be held for the remaining KMT shares. Sunkyong paid an average of
Won340,00 for each share, which were trading this week on the Seoul bourse
at Won327,000.
The KMT share price has grown from Won50,000 since late 1991, reflecting the
large demand for cellular telephone services. The number of subscribers
reached 470,000 at the end of last year.
KMT, which was established in 1984, reported net profits of Won71.9bn on
sales of Won420bn last year.
Other main KMT shareholders are the Bank of Seoul, Korea Fund, and the Korea
Stock Stabilisation Fund.
A second cellular telephone network will be formed by a consortium of
companies next month to compete against KMT.
Sunkyong in 1992 was awarded the licence to operate the second mobile
telephone network, but was then forced to relinquish the contract because of
charges of nepotism involving the families of the Sunkyong chairman and
then-Korean president Roh Tae.
