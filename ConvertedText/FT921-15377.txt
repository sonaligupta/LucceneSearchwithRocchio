FT  10 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Bundesbahn to buy Spanish rail wagons


   By PETER BRUCE


   MADRID


THE GERMAN state railway monopoly, the Bundesbahn, yesterday signed a
document of intent to buy 114 Spanish railway wagons for Dollars 80m (Pounds
42.7m) to mark the first time that Spain has been able to export its unique
Talgo railway technology.
The deal, which the chairman of the Bundesbahn, Mr Heinz Durr, was due to
sign in Madrid last night, was triggered by Spain's decision in 1988 to
award a Dollars 350m contract for 75 high-powered locomotives to Siemens.
The Talgo wagons are produced by a joint venture between Renfe, the Spanish
railway monopoly, and a privately-owned Basque group. Talgo (the Spanish
acronym for the Goicoechea-Oriol light articulated train) is a technology
developed more than 40 years ago by a Basque engineer, Mr Alejandro
Goicoechea, and financed by the Oriol family during the Franco dictatorship.
Franco had ordered Spain's railway gauge to be wider than the conventional
European gauge in order, it is said, to deter invasions.
Thus, one characteristic of Talgo is a wheel arrangement enabling it to pass
from the Spanish to the French gauge without stopping.
The Bundesbahn plans to use the Talgo trains on overnight routes between
Berlin and Basle and Munich and Zurich. Talgo's manufacturers claim that
because it is so light it saves on engine energy and that its carriages are
connected in such a way that they do not jolt.
Essentially, Talgo technology is based on the fact that each wheel has its
own axle, placed between and not under the carriages, and which can be
independently manipulated. This places the suspension above the point of
gravity on each wagon, enabling it to achieve high speeds with reduced
lateral movements.
