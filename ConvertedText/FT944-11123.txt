FT  08 NOV 94 / Change urged for building societies


A change to the rules on building society mergers and takeovers, to allow
the public interest to be taken into account, is to be urged today by Mr
Alistair Darling, Labour's City spokesman.
Mr Darling wants no more takeovers and mergers to be allowed until new
guidelines have been set. He says that while no one could blame investors
for being ready to accept Pounds 1,000 to give up their membership rights,
'payments of this sort are no way to make policy'.
