FT  20 APR 91 / UK Company News: Century recommends Fuchs offer


   By RICHARD GOURLAY


CENTURY OILS, the UK lub-ricants group, has dropped its objections to the
hostile 145p-a-share bid from Fuchs, and recommended it to shareholders.
The Century board said it still believed the offer from the German
family-owned lubricants company failed to place a proper value on Century,
but recognised that it had proved attractive.
After the market closed yesterday Fuchs raised its holding in Century to
49.9 per cent, from 43 per cent at the start of the day.
Century also recommended the offer of 116p per preference share and said it
would be talking to Fuchs about an orderly transition for the business.
Century had promised a management reshuffle in its efforts to see off the
Pounds 46.2m cash bid.
Mr Charles Mitchell, chairman and managing director, said in a letter to
shareholders that the group had been planning to split his role since last
year and a new managing director would be appointed as soon as possible.
Mr Manfred Fuchs, chairman of the German group, said he had been reluctant
to launch a hostile bid after years of friendly contact with Century but
that repeated efforts for a merger had been rejected.
