FT  11 MAR 94 / International Company News: Deficit trimmed to SKr1.52bn for
year

Trelleborg, the troubled Swedish mining and metals group, yesterday reported
a pre-tax loss of SKr1.52bn (Dollars 190m) in 1993, a slight improvement on
a loss of SKr1.56bn in 1992 which the group said presaged a return to profit
in 1994.
The company, which has been undergoing radical restructuring after being
badly hit by falling world metals prices, said its turnround programme of
cost cutting and disposals had significantly strengthened its financial
position.
Meanwhile, the weakness of the Swedish krona was giving a positive effect
after heavy foreign currency losses in 1992 and early-1993. If metal prices
did not worsen and an upward trend in its industrial operations continued,
the group would return to a 'positive result' this year, Trelleborg said.
Group sales in 1993 were SKr21.9bn, down from SKr23.6bn in 1992, while
operating losses rose to SKr326m from SKr186m in 1992.
But Trelleborg stressed it was reaping the benefits of restructuring
measures taken last year. It raised SKr1.3bn through the sale of Munksjo, a
paper and packaging company, and SKr900m from the sale of the group's stake
in Svedala, a materials handling company, taking proceeds from divestments
to more than SKr3.6bn over the year. It also raised SKr1.14bn in a rights
issue.
As a result, the balance sheet sank to SKr21.5bn from SKr25.7bn.
