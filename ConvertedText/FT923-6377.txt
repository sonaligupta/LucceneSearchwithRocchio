FT  25 AUG 92 / Letter: Not worth auditing the auditor


   From Mr DAVID COOKSEY


Sir, Observer's suggestion (August 20) that the Audit Commission should take
some of its own medicine and be subject to a value-for-money audit was very
close to, but a little slow off, the mark. In reviewing our own audit with
the National Audit Office earlier this year, we put forward exactly the same
proposal. The NAO decided it had more rewarding targets to pursue and
declined.
As far as pay and fees go, we are trying to give Mr Norman Lamont a lead.
Salaries were increased by 4 per cent in April and we will be proposing a
fee increase of less than 2 per cent in November. I make no apologies for
Howard Davies's salary rise. It came from my insistence that, for the first
time, he should take up his full entitlement to performance-related pay. He
richly deserved it.
David Cooksey,
chairman,
The Audit Commission
