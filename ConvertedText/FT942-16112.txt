FT  12 APR 94 / UK Company News: Wakebourne Pounds 19m in red


As forecast, Wakebourne, the computer support concern, suffered pre-tax
losses for 1993 of Pounds 18.6m, largely reflecting the write-off in the
Lantek Electronics investment.
The outcome was from turnover of Pounds 23.2m (Pounds 24.2m), including
discontinued activities of Pounds 958,000 (Pounds 18.2m), and compared with
profits of Pounds 453,000 for 1992. Losses per share were 3.6p, against 0.1p
earnings.
Directors said that, in contrast, the UK computer support side, which makes
up the principal trading activity, recorded operating profits during 1993 of
Pounds 2.6m excluding discontinued activities.
