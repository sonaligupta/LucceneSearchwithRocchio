FT  07 JAN 94 / Hebrides quarry inquiry ordered


   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent


Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, yesterday ordered a public inquiry into a
plan by the construction group Redland to open a large coastal quarry on the
island of Harris in the Outer Hebrides.
The move will please environmental organisations which have been campaigning
against the project.
Western Isles council decided last June by 24 votes to three to give Redland
Aggregates, Redland's construction materials subsidiary, permission to open
the quarry. The Pounds 50m project would involve extracting 600m tonnes of
anorthosite, a white rock used in road building, from the headland of
Lingerabay in South Harris.
The quarrying, lasting about 60 years, would cover a square mile. Lingerabay
would disappear and a new sea loch would be created. The rock would be taken
away by sea.
Mr Lang said the proposal raised important national issues. The inquiry will
cover only the Lingerabay project, but is likely to be seen as a pointer to
decisions on other projects for coastal quarries in the Highlands.
Supporters of the project argue that it would create employment and benefit
the economy of South Harris, whose population is in decline.
Environmental organisations argue that it would destroy unspoilt landscape
and cause sea pollution. A leading objector was Scottish Natural Heritage,
the government's environmental agency.
