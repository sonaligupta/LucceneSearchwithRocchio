NATIONAL Bank of Abu Dhabi (NBAD), the largest bank in the United Arab
Emirates in terms of total assets, said net profit rose 3 per cent in 1991,
to Dh92.6m (Dollars 25.33m) from Dh90.2m the previous year, AP-DJ reports
from Manama.
The bank said it had set aside Dh68.3m as a provision for possible loans
losses, 37 per cent above the Dh50m of provisions in 1990.
Net interest income rose 12 per cent to Dh260.8m from Dh233m in 1990, the
bank said.
Total assets at the end of December 1991 stood at Dh25.45bn, up 8 per cent
from Dh23.549bn a year earlier.
Bank deposits with NBAD dropped sharply, by 26 per cent, to Dh2.98bn at the
year end, from Dh4.04bn. That was partly offset by a 17 per cent rise in
customer deposits, which gained to Dh20.1bn from Dh17.2bn.
Loans and advances were up 23 per cent, to Dh9.549bn from 7.77bn.
NBAD proposed total dividends of Dh75.3m, unchanged from the 1990 payout.
