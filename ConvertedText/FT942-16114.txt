FT  12 APR 94 / UK Company News: Bilton shares fall 39p on downward property
valuation


   By SIMON DAVIES


Shares in Bilton, the property and construction company, yesterday fell 39p
to 590p after the company announced an 11 per cent drop in the value of its
property investment portfolio.
The downward valuation came in spite of the fact that companies have been
reporting a sharp improvement in the UK property investment market.
The announcement accompanied Bilton's results for 1993, with the company
reporting pre-tax profits of Pounds 17.4m, up from Pounds 17.1m in 1992.
The mark-down of Bilton's property values was the result of its first
external valuation since 1989. Bilton had announced consistent increases
from internal valuations in the previous three years, despite an
unequivocally falling market. King Sturge, the chartered surveyors, valued
Bilton's 7m sq ft portfolio at Pounds 312.2m, compared with a valuation of
Pounds 352m in December 1992. There have been no material changes in the
portfolio.
Net asset value per share amounted to 643p (739p).
Group turnover from trading activities fell from Pounds 10.4m to Pounds
9.1m, reflecting competitive market conditions.
Profit on ordinary activities at the trading level fell to Pounds 20m
(Pounds 20.5m), but net interest payable was reduced to Pounds 2.6m (Pounds
3.42m). The company did not release its balance sheet yes-terday, but
gearing is expected to have increased marginally from the 13 per cent
recorded in 1992.
Earnings per share emerged at 27.3p (26.8p) and the directors proposed a
final dividend of 13.61p, making 19.28p (18.9p) for the year.
