FT  14 APR 94 / Reinsurance deal on export risk


The government has agreed terms with Trade Indemnity, the credit insurance
group, to provide support for reinsuring short-term political risk cover for
exporters.
When the government privatised the short-term credit businesses of the
Export Credits Guarantee Department it said it would withdraw entirely from
supplying reinsurance support.
