FT  07 MAR 94 / UN appeal on Sarajevo services


   By JUDY DEMPSEY


   BERLIN


United Nations officials intend to restore electricity and water supplies to
the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo, but they urgently require more troops to
protect power plants and open roads into the city.
Mr Yasushi Akashi, the UN's special envoy to the former Yugoslavia,
yesterday said it was essential to build on the ceasefire through restoring
Sarajevo's essential services.
However, a UN official said the troops still had no mandate to demilitarise
the city and did not yet control all entry and exit routes, which in most
cases were controlled by Bosnian Serb patrols.
Mr Akashi has already said his forces require at least 4,000 troops for
Sarajevo. Britain has indicated it would send more if supported by other
countries.
Meanwhile in Vienna, Bosnian Croat and Bosnian Moslem officials, along with
Croat officials, will today continue talks aimed at deciding how to
implement the complex federal and confederal plan agreed in Washington last
week.
Bosnian Croat forces yesterday started withdrawing heavy weapons from
south-west Bosnia a day ahead of the deadline agreed as part of the plan.
The plan envisages the creation of a Bosnian Croat and Moslem federation in
part of Bosnia, loosely linked to Croatia through a confederal structure.
A transitional committee, comprising representatives from Zagreb and the
Croat and Moslem-held territories of Bosnia-Hercegovina will negotiate until
March 15 and seek agreement on four issues:
The constitution of the federation;
The relationship between the confederation and the proposed federation;
Military arrangements in the federation;
The creation of governmental/administrative structures for the confederation
and the federation.
President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia and Mr Radovan Karadzic, head of the
Bosnian Serbs, have yet to decide whether to join the new federal structure
for Bosnia.
