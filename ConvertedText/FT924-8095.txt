FT  13 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Jupiter Tyndall holders agree options
scheme


   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent


A proposal to award Mr Leonard Licht, Jupiter Tyndall's new deputy chairman,
options over 1.8m of the fund management group's shares was approved by
two-thirds of shareholders yesterday, with Mercury Asset Management voting
against the proposal.
Mr John Duffield, Jupiter Tyndall's chairman, acknowledged that the scheme
was unusual in that the terms under which the options might be exercised
were undisclosed. 'We haven't disclosed them for commercial reasons,' he
said, but insisted they were 'very stringent'.
The Association of British Insurers has set guidelines for the exercise of
executive share options and urges that they should only be exercisable on
demonstration of improvements in company performance.
MAM, Mr Licht's former employer and holder of 24 per cent of Jupiter's
shares, had been joined in its opposition by an insurance company
shareholder. The vote occurred at an extraordinary meeting to approve Mr
Licht's share options along with three other schemes intended to award share
options to employees.
The options, exercisable in three years, entitle Mr Licht to purchase shares
at 108p.
