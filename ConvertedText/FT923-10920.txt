FT  28 JUL 92 / International Company News: Uni Storebrand


Mr Bjoern Wolrath, Skandia's president, said Skandia had proposed to Uni
Storebrand that it undertake its capital increase that would be combined
with an option to buy Uni Storebrand's 28 per cent stake in the Swedish
insurer.
Mr Wolrath suggested this option would create an opportunity for Uni to
dispose of its Skandia shareholding. He said the option could expire in 1993
or 1994.
