FT  28 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Japanese protest at US phone call
discounts


   By PAUL ABRAHAMS


A telecommunications trade war threatened yesterday following complaints by
Japanese groups about US companies' trading practices.
The Japanese carriers have asked the country's post and telecommunications
ministry to investigate discounts offered by Fibercom Network and
International Telecom of New York, and USA Global Link of Iowa.
The three US groups, which provide discounts of up to 40 per cent on
international calls, said they would file a complaint with the US trade
representative in Tokyo if restrictions were placed on them.
The dispute comes at a delicate moment for the US and Japanese governments.
They are negotiating framework arrangements to reduce Japan's trade surplus
with the US and make the country more accessible for goods and services
exporters.
The US companies have negotiated bulk contracts with large carriers such as
AT&T. Callers phone a switching centre in the US and hang up after the
number rings twice. The switching centre then automatically calls back,
leaving the users to dial their ultimate destination. The companies claim
international call-back schemes, which have been running in Japan for two
years, are legal, because technically the calls originate in the US.
The Japanese complainants are KDD, which used to hold a monopoly of
international services in Japan, International Digital Communications and
International Telecom Japan. They claim the US groups are making free use of
their domestic lines.
The US discounters said they would be willing to pay reasonable charges for
the lines, and were willing to hold friendly talks with the Japanese
carriers. So far they have gained only 1 per cent of the Y250bn (Pounds
1,497m) telecoms services market.
