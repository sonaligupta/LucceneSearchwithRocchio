FT  04 SEP 93 / Arts: Enjoy an opera or ballet for only Pounds 10 - The new
ROH season's programme


   By ANTONY THORNCROFT


YOUR NAME has come up and you are guaranteed the best available seat, (at
the time you are contacted), at Covent Garden for just Pounds 10 - how great
a bargain is it, and are you likely to have an exhilarating experience?
Yes and Yes. Most of the seats up for offer under the scheme are likely to
be good ones, often the orchestra stalls which for opera can go for up to
Pounds 100, or more. So there is little doubt that they represent remarkable
value for the money.
But you are also likely to enjoy yourself immensely. Not only is the Royal
Opera House one of the grandest and most awesome theatres in the land, but
Covent Garden is currently enjoying an artistic renaissance. Last season it
swept the board in the prize-giving ceremonies for the best opera and ballet
performances in London, and the programme devised by general director Jeremy
Isaacs for 1993-94 is particularly exciting, especially for opera.
The opera schedule is a mixture of popular favourites, designed to ensure a
good box office take in difficult economic times, and intriguing new
productions. There are seven new productions, which seem destined to get the
critics scribbling furiously.
The first to enter the programme, on October 8, is the first new Covent
Garden production in decades of Wagner's Die Meistersinger von Nurnberg,
with its intense personal dramas and rousing choruses. It promises to be a
stylish show, set firmly in the Germany of the late medieval period and with
popular local favourite Thomas Allen, and perhaps the world's leading
Wagnerian bass baritone John Tomlinson, in leading roles. Covent Garden's
music director Bernard Haitink conducts the work for the first time. The
Mastersinger, Wagner's celebration of the power of music, should be a
highlight.
The new Die Zauberflote (The Magic Flute) is very colourful, with many fresh
young singers, and was well received when first seen in Glasgow last year.
If this is one of the most popular and frequently performed of operas, the
next new production, Cherubin, by the late 19th century composer Massenet,
is a great rarity. It tells what happened to the lovesick Cherubino after he
was sent to the wars in Mozart's Marriage of Figaro. It is light and
charming and has a young cast under the baton of the Russian conductor
Gennady Rozhdestvensky, a rare visitor to Covent Garden. The new Katya
Kabanova is directed by Trevor Nunn, conducted by Haitink, and has an
undoubted star, Elena Prokina, singing the title role. This is dramatic,
compelling opera by Janacek which has become popular in recent years. In
contrast Giordano's Fedora is almost unknown and was last staged at Covent
Garden in 1925. It is a tragic love story and has a suitably romantic
leading tenor in Jose Carreras.
The other two new opera productions are by Italian masters, Rossini's Mose
in Egitto, a rare dramatic opera by this most melodic of composers, and
Verdi's ever-popular Aida. Amazingly, Aida has not been performed at Covent
Garden since 1984 and we are promised a spectacular and undoubtedly rousing
production.
While the new productions grab the headlines, there are plenty of delights
in the revivals. There is a return of the elegant 1950s production of
Puccini's Madama Butterfly, with Diana Soviero making her debut in the role
at Covent Garden as the tragic Cio-Cio-San. There is a lively, colourful,
L'Italiana in Algeri, with firm favourite Marilyn Horne making perhaps her
last Covent Garden appearance in the title role. There is a speedy revival
for Mozart's Mitridate, Re di Ponto, which he wrote when he was only 14, and
which won the 1992 Olivier Award for the Most Outstanding Achievement of the
Year in Opera. There is Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin, which opened last
season to mixed reviews for the production but which is promised another
outstanding cast. There are those old standbys, Tosca, Rigoletto and Carmen,
which can hardly fail, a dramatic Elektra, and Un ballo in maschera which
brings back to Covent Garden the popular conductor Daniel Gatti. The only
contemporary work in the canon is Harrison Birtwistle's Gawain, which was
either loved or loathed on its 1991 unveiling. It has been shortened, but
contains many dazzling effects, not least the beheading of the mysterious
Green Knight.
Many will take up our special offer just for the outside chance of seeing
one of the greatest tenors of our generation for a tenner. Placido Domingo
will appear as Don Jose for four performances in Carmen, and there is the
most outside of outside chances that you may get a ticket. If you miss
Domingo you might be watching one of his successors in Le Nozze di Figaro
(The Marriage of Figaro), which stars Bryn Terfel, the highly acclaimed
young Welsh baritone, making his Covent Garden debut as the scheming Figaro.
Throw in the lush Manon, Gwyneth Jones in La fanciulla del west, and a visit
from Opera North with that oddball, Benjamin Britten's Gloriana, composed
for the Queen's Coronation in 1953, and you have in prospect one of the most
intriguing Covent Garden seasons in recent years.
It is hard to pretend that the 1993-94 dance season at the Royal Opera House
offers such potential excitements. The Royal Ballet is building up its
strength and its only new full-length production this season opens in
Washington. But there are many intriguing performances in prospect. The
opening programme offers four short ballets (two of which are world
premieres) and finds The Royal Ballet dancing in contemporary style but on
points. Two of the new works are choreographed by Matthew Hart and William
Tuckett, both dancers with The Royal Ballet.
Then comes the quintessential ballet, Romeo and Juliet, with Darcey Bussell
expected to make her debut in the role as one of the three Juliets on offer.
The run up to Christmas brings back two popular seasonal favourites. Tales
of Beatrix Potter charmed many last season (if not all the critics), and
there is a welcome long run of Nutcrackers. This is followed by another
great dramatic ballet, Kenneth MacMillan's Mayerling. The only other
full-length ballet in the season is Don Quixote, which the public loved and
the critics gave the thumbs down to. Once again Darcy Bussell is pledged to
appear, along with Sylvie Guillem and Viviana Durante.
At the end of the season The Birmingham Royal Ballet makes its annual
appearance at Covent Garden with the London premiere of David Bintley's new
work, Sylvia, and then an intriguing triple bill of Balanchine's Serenade; a
new production, Fall River Legend, choreographed by Agnes de Mille, and the
ever-popular Elite Syncopations.
It is hard to believe that anyone receiving a ticket for any of these
occasions will consider that their tenner has been squandered.
