FT  09 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Mandate for action at TSB


   By DAVID GOODHART


TSB, the sixth-largest banking group, may face selective industrial action
over three compulsory redundancies after restructuring at the bank.
Bifu, the banking union, yesterday released results of a ballot among its
20,000 members at TSB on industrial action. It showed 4,895 in favour and
2,100 against.
Union officials will meet today to decide how to proceed and are expected to
recommend selective strikes at branches all over the country.
Ms Jennifer Cole, Bifu negotiating officer, said: 'Staff have shown TSB
exactly what they think of compulsory redundancies, low staffing levels . .
. and their new staff structure which would mean reductions in salary and
promotion expectations.'
The union says that nearly 4,000 jobs have been cut since 1989, but it is
most alarmed at three compulsory redundancies, which, it says, are in breach
of an agreement.
TSB said last night that no agreement has been breached and the bank had had
no intention of breaking agreements. 'Strike action will not prevent us
going on with our successful restructuring,' it said.
