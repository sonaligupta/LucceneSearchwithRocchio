FT  30 JAN 92 / Berlin warned about city's mounting debts


   By LESLIE COLITT


   BERLIN


BERLIN, financially strapped by unification, faces a cumulative debt of up
to DM45bn (Pounds 15.6bn) by 1995, Mr Elmar Pieroth, the city's finance
chief, has warned in a delayed five year budget plan. The city's cumulative
debt was only DM18bn in 1990.
Berlin's federal subsidies, covering nearly half the city's budget in past
years, are being reduced sharply as are special investment incentives and
the German Unity Fund. At the same time Berlin is spending heavily on
infrastructure projects in the east of the city.
Mr Pieroth said the city's 'new identity' - Berlin is to become the
functioning capital of Germany by the end of the decade - has meant a fight
for additional funds from Bonn.
The city's budget deficits are expected to rise from DM6.3bn next year to
DM9.2bn in 1994 and DM12.6bn in 1995, although new indebtedness is to be
reduced from DM5.8bn in 1992 to DM2bn in 1995. Subsidies from Bonn, which
will total DM13.2bn this year compared with DM14.5bn in 1991, are to be
slashed to DM6.7bn in 1995, on present plans. The city had planned to cut
10,000 municipal jobs this year from the bloated number inherited from east
and west Berlin.
Berlin's Chamber of Industry and Commerce expressed doubts that as many jobs
as this would be saved, noting that Berlin's level of public-sector
employment was far higher than the other city-states of Hamburg and Bremen.
City tax revenues are forecast to rise from DM11bn this year to DM17bn in
1995. This means Berlin would finance 39 per cent of its spending from taxes
compared with 27 per cent at present. West German cities finance more than
60 per cent of spending from taxes. Many companies in the city, however,
plan to move to surrounding Brandenburg state.
