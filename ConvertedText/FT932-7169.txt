FT  25 MAY 93 / International Company News: Nikon turns in first loss since
stock listing - Japanese Corporate News and Results Round-up


   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO


NIKON, the Japanese camera and precision instruments manufacturer, yesterday
reported a plunge into pre-tax losses of Y2.33bn (Dollars 21m) for the 12
months to March from profits of Y7.23bn the year before. Sales fell 11 per
cent to Y204.9bn.
This was the first loss incurred by the company since it was listed on the
stock exchange in 1949. It followed depressed demand for its semiconductor
equipment and precision instruments caused by a sharp downturn in capital
spending by Japanese corporations.
At the net level the company managed to stay in the black with profits of
Y219m, down 93 per cent from Y3.32bn.
Nikon, which depends for 54.4 per cent of sales on exports, said its camera
sales had also been under pressure due to the downturn in consumer spending
in Japan.
Compact cameras performed relatively well, but sales of single-lens reflex
cameras and interchangeable lenses had been disappointing.
Precision instruments were particularly hard hit by the decline in capital
spending by semiconductor manufacturers.
Sales of Nikon's machinery division plunged 35 per cent in the domestic
market against 4 per cent overseas.
Continuing weakness in capital spending by corporations and the slump in
personal consumption, the sharp appreciation of the yen, trade friction and
sluggishness in EC markets were expected to work against the rapid recovery
of markets, Nikon said.
The company was working to raise efficiency, slim down operations and cut
costs, it said. For example, it had moved some production to Southeast Asia
for the first time in order to deal with the stronger yen.
