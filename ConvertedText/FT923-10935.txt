FT  28 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Wembley sells Guild offshoot for Pounds 19m

   LONDON, PARIS


WEMBLEY, the international leisure group which owns the national stadium,
has agreed to sell Guild Entertainment, the UK independent distributor of
films, for an initial Pounds 19m to Chargeurs of France.
It has also received permission to install up to 1,200 electronic gaming
machines - 'one-arm bandits without the arms' - at Lincoln Greyhound Park in
Rhode Island, US.
The Guild sale is part of Wembley's policy of reducing its debt by disposing
of non-core businesses. In April borrowings totalled some Pounds 175m; after
the sale they will fall to Pounds 124m, giving gearing of 58 per cent,
according to Mr Alex McCrindle, finance director.
The initial consideration is in cash and Wembley will be paid a further
Pounds 5.5m, dependent on Guild's profits performance in 1992.
Wembley bought Guild in October 1989 for Pounds 23.8m in cash and shares.
The figure included an outstanding balance of Pounds 4.5m in respect of
letters of credit issued to the original Guild vendors which will remain
payable by Wembley.
Guild distributes mainly independently-made films - such as Terminator 2,
Dances with Wolves and Basic Instinct - to the cinema, video and television
industries and made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.9m on turnover of Pounds
33.9m in 1991.
For Chargeurs, which has extensive interests in textiles and the film
industry, the acquisition offers an opportunity to expand its film and video
interests.
The French group, headed by the controversial Mr Jerome Seydoux, a close
associate of President Francois Mitterrand, is already a leading force in
the French film industry. It is an investor in Renn Productions, the
film-making company connected with Mr Claud Berri, the French producer
behind Jean de Florette and Manon des Sources, and in the Pathe cinema
chain.
