FT  28 JAN 94 / Carsberg criticises delay in reforms


   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent


Sir Bryan Carsberg, the director-general of fair trading, criticised the
government yesterday for failing to introduce reforms of restrictive trade
practices legislation.
De-regulation bill measures announced last week would help reduce burdens on
industry of complying with competition law, but reform of the law on
anti-competitive agreements would have 'reduced the burdens on business
generally while also creating a more effective protection of competition',
he said.
Sir Bryan outlined changes to OFT competition procedures in support of the
government's de-regulation initiative. These included setting up a register
to cope with an expected rise in the number of undertakings negotiated by
industry as an alternative to a monopoly or merger reference.
Widening the 'fix it first' approach by allowing companies to offer a wider
range of undertakings is designed to reduce the number of merger references
to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Numbers have already declined to a
low level.
Presenting the MMC's annual review yesterday, Mr Graeme Odgers, MMC
chairman, said work had been dominated by monopoly inquiries in 1993 -
though at the end of the year it only had two merger inquiries in progress.
Mr Odgers said the MMC also supported the government's de-regulation
initiative in an attempt to reduce the burdens of MMC inquiries on business.
The commission has produced a video to try to demystify the inquiry process
for businesses which have not been involved in an investigation before.
But he refused to be drawn on recommendations for changes to commission
procedures made by a review last year by accountancy firm Price Waterhouse.
The firm called for changes to cut out unnecessary overlaps in the roles of
the OFT and the MMC.
