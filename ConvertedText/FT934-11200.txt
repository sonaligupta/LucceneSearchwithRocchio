Peter Bates, who has been sales and marketing director of the Savoy group of
hotels and restaurants for the past five years, is moving next month to do
the job with the same title at Mount Charlotte Thistle Hotels.
To those who might be puzzled by the move and think the Savoy is about as
grand as you can get, Bates' riposte is that the Savoy has just six hotels
and an annual turnover of Pounds 75m; Mount Charlotte Thistle, meanwhile,
had a turnover in 1992 of Pounds 217m and 112 hotels. 'It's a much bigger
job and therefore a great challenge,' he says.
Mount Charlotte, which is 70 per cent owned by Brierley Investments of New
Zealand, could be floated in the next couple of years. Bates' previous
experience with the privatisation of Gleneagles Hotels in Scotland and the
flotation of the Mandarin Oriental Hotels in Hong Kong could come in handy.
Bates, 42, is also keen to scotch rumours that his move is in any way linked
to the enthusiasm Rocco Forte has expressed in the past for his Forte group
to acquire the Savoy.
Peter Haigh, currently regional director of sales and marketing UK and
Ireland for Marriott Hotels and Resorts, takes over from Bates. Haigh, 45,
was with Marriott for 14 years, working in both the UK and US and has been
responsible for sales and marketing throughout Europe, the Middle East and
Africa.
Bates also happens to be a director of Isis, an executive search agency
specialising in the hospitality and travel industry, a connection which came
in handy when it was time to look for his successor. Haigh was recruited
through Isis, although Bates himself landed his new job 'after an invitation
to breakfast', he says.
