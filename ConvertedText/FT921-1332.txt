FT  25 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Sabena cancels Dollars 200m firm order for
five Boeings


   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent


SABENA, the Belgian national airline, has cancelled a firm order for five
Boeing 737-500 twin-engine aircraft, worth about Dollars 200m (Pounds
115.6m), because of cash problems caused by the delay in its planned
partnership with Air France.
But the Belgian airline said Czechoslovak Airlines (CSA) had agreed to buy
the five Boeing 110-120 seater aircraft as part of its efforts to replace
its fleet of Soviet-built airliners with western jets.
The CSA agreement to take over the order means that the Belgian airline is
not expected to face penalty payments for cancelling a firm order.
Sabena also has ordered five other Boeing 737s, for delivery in 1994 and
1995.
The Sabena decision reflects not only the airline's own cash problems but
the continuing softness in the commercial aircraft market.
Although Boeing expects to deliver a record total of 223 of its 737
narrow-body airliners this year, the manufacturer is planning to reduce
monthly 737 production from 21 aircraft at present to 14 in October.
The Sabena move also represents the first time an airline has cancelled a
firm order with Boeing.
Sabena is still waiting for Belgian government approval for its partnership
deal with Air France.
This would see Air France and Belgian investors acquire a 37.5 per cent
stake in Sabena for BFr6bn (Pounds 101m).
Air France is also closely associated with CSA.
It became last week the first western carrier to acquire a stake in an
eastern European airline by taking, with a group of French and international
institutional investors, 40 per cent of CSA.
