FT  22 DEC 92 / Russia set to bring in own currency

RUSSIA was said yesterday to be on the verge of introducing its own
currency, a move which would force all other republics to introduce their
own and deprive them of direct influence over Moscow's monetary policy.
At the same time, however, Mr Valerian Kulikov, central bank deputy
chairman, outlined, in an interview with Izvestia newspaper, a shift in
credit and finance policies which would weaken whatever currency replaces
the old Soviet rouble.
'We will correct the policy of the central bank in accordance with the
government line announced by the new prime minister,' he said, referring to
Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin's promise to stem a fall in industrial output and
wipe out the debts accumulated by state-owned enterprises.
New measures included negative annual interest rates of 3-10 per cent for
central bank loans for investment in industry and, apart from introducing
new tax benefits, even waiving reserve requirements for commercial banks
which lend to priority sectors, such as consumer goods.
Social security minister Ella Pamfilova has offered to quit the Russian
government, the first member of former acting prime minister Yegor Gaidar's
cabinet to do so, Interfax news agency said yesterday.
