FT  01 NOV 93 / Top 1,000 groups 'have cut 1.5m jobs'


   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent and RICHARD DONKIN


BRITAIN'S 1,000 largest companies shed about 1.5m workers in the year to
March 1993 as costs were cut to cope with the recession, says a survey
conducted for Director magazine.
The survey, which also shows that average pre-tax profits fell over the same
period by nearly 8 per cent while sales rose by a little more than 4 per
cent, suggests that the total workforce employed by the top 1,000 companies
dropped from 8.6m people to just over 7m.
In the four previous years, staff numbers had remained reasonably steady,
dropping by only 300,000 from their peak in 1989.
The cuts in staffing were deepest - averaging nearly 8 per cent - within the
remnants of the state-owned sector, most notably in British Coal. The
average reduction in the private sector was less than 2 per cent while
foreign-owned businesses, on average, trimmed their UK numbers by 5 per
cent. The days of the giant centralised corporation are over, according to a
senior director in one of Britain's biggest companies, writes Richard
Donkin.
Mr Mike Bett, deputy chairman of British Telecommunications and incoming
president of the Institute of Personnel Management, says in the latest issue
of Personnel Management magazine that new technology will lead to more
companies decentralising their operations.
'For many years the average size of companies has been declining. The
current drive towards keeping to the core business will reduce the average
size of companies even further.'
The result, he says, will be more companies supplying services traditionally
carried out in-house.
He adds that this will have repercussions such as less commuting and greater
difficulty for unions in organising.
