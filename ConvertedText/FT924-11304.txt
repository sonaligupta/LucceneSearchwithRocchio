FT  27 OCT 92 / Kohl plea for curb on asylum seekers


   By QUENTIN PEEL

CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl yesterday issued his grimmest warning yet of the
effect of an unrestricted influx of asylum-seekers into Germany, declaring
that failure to curb it could lead to a 'state of national emergency'.
Unofficial estimates put the number in October at approaching 60,000,
compared with 42,000 in September.
'We have already passed the limit of what we can bear,' he told the annual
conference of his Christian Democratic Union (CDU). 'The influx. . . . is
leading to unbearable conditions in our towns and cities.'
In an urgent appeal to the opposition Social Democratic party (SPD) to agree
on a common policy, he added: 'If it is not dealt with, we are facing the
danger of a profound crisis of confidence in our democratic state.'
He was speaking after new signs of SPD disarray over how far to go in
restricting the far-reaching right to asylum enshrined in the constitution.
The governing coalition, led by Mr Kohl's CDU, is demanding a change to
limit the right of asylum to those coming from countries with recognised
political persecution.
The SPD has called a congress next month to decide its position, with Mr
Bjorn Engholm, its leader, calling for a constitutional change. However, a
growing number of SPD branches are opposed.
Mr Kohl yesterday estimated the number of purported asylum seekers this year
at well over 400,000. Barely 5 per cent 'are genuinely persecuted'.
Mr Volker Ruhe, German defence minister, suffered a severe setback in his
ambition to succeed Mr Kohl as chancellor when he was defeated in a poll to
become one of four deputy leaders of the CDU.
The vote marks a startling revolt by the party grassroots against its
leadership, and in particular by the new members from east Germany.
