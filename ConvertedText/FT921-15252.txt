FT  11 JAN 92 / International Company News: Borden to axe 1,300 jobs


   By NIKKI TAIT


   NEW YORK


BORDEN, the packaging, adhesives and foods group, yesterday announced plans
to cut around 1,300 jobs as part of a corporate reorganisation designed to
pare costs. This will result in the fourth quarter charge of around Dollars
70m before tax.
Borden said that, after the provision, it expected 1991 after-tax earnings
to stand at around Dollars 295m or Dollars 2 a share.
The main impact of the reorganisation will come in Borden's US dairy, food
services and Pacific Rim businesses, the company said. At end-1991,
according to Borden, there were some 15,000 salaried employees among a
worldwide total of 44,000.
Borden's brands range from Creamette pastas to Bravos chips and from Eagle
Brand ice-cream to Elmer's glues and wood-fillers.
It began a major plant modernisation programme in 1989, but efficiencies
have been slow to show through, and there has been competitive pressure in
certain product areas - such as snack foods.
