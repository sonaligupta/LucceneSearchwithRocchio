FT  15 NOV 93 / Reshuffle at Fiat due to Agnelli unease


   By HAIG SIMONIAN


   MILAN


MR Umberto Agnelli, deputy chairman of Italy's Fiat group who will formally
resign at a special shareholders' meeting in Turin today, is believed to
have threatened to break up the family holding company and move abroad after
recent setbacks within the business empire.
The threat of a split in one of Europe's richest families and consequent
risk to Fiat and the Agnellis' other interests explain the complex
redistribution of roles within the family announced on Friday night.
The changes include the appointment to Fiat's board of Mr Agnelli's son,
Giovanni, and an explicit family 'vote of confidence' in Mr Agnelli by
giving him executive powers at Ifi, the quoted holding company at the heart
of the Agnellis' widespread business interests.
Mr Gabriele Galateri di Genola, managing director of the Ifil investment
group, is taking a similar post at Ifi, which controls Ifil. Mr Galateri has
helped turn Ifil, chaired by Mr Agnelli, into one of the country's most
successful companies.
The reshuffle at Fiat and Ifi is believed to be a response to growing
dissatisfaction felt by Mr Agnelli, who was expected to assume the Fiat
chairmanship on the retirement of his elder bother Gianni next year.
That changed in September when Mr Gianni Agnelli announced he would stay on
for an extra two years.
In spite of Mr Umberto Agnelli's own business talents and diligence, he has
tended to remain in the shadow of his elder brother Gianni.
