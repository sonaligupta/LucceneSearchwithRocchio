FT  15 APR 94 / Bundesbank makes record profits


   By DAVID WALLER


   FRANKFURT


The Bundesbank made record profits of DM18.83bn (Pounds 7.48bn) last year,
defying the recession in Germany which its critics allege it helped to
foster with unnecessarily high interest rates, writes David Waller in
Frankfurt.
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, expressed satisfaction but no glee
about the profits.
The profits reflect the turbulence in world currency markets last year and
are up from the DM14.73bn made in 1992. Of the total, DM18.26bn was
transferred yesterday to the government, where all but DM7bn of the cash
must by law be used to pay off government debt as it falls due. The rest can
be offset against the budget deficit.
Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, said yesterday he was pleased with the
result but stressed that the profit did not create room for more public
spending. It would mean that the government would borrow DM11bn less this
year on the capital markets than originally planned, he said.
