THE Russian government will sell shares in three state-owned oil-related
companies on August 18 in its first public privatisation offer in the oil
sector, writes Leyla Boulton in Moscow. Mr Dmitry Skorduli, head of the
All-Russian Co-ordination Centre for Voucher Auctions, said 8.3 per cent of
the shares would be offered at auctions to be held simultaneously around the
country. Subscriptions will remain open for two weeks. Foreigners with
Moscow offices will find it easier to buy shares than non-residents as the
latter are still not allowed to hold rouble bank accounts and are unable to
transfer funds to pay for shares from abroad.
