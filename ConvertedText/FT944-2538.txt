FT  16 DEC 94 / Observer: Passing the baton


Will UN Security Council meetings ever be the same again, now that Sir David
Hannay, the UK's representative, is to step down next July?
Always ready with a crisp warning for Saddam Hussein or (rather less
credibly) to the Bosnian Serbs, the Humphrey Appleby look-alike has rather
become the dominant figure in the council since 1992, when his US colleague
Tom Pickering was exiled to India.
Pickering was replaced by the black but otherwise colourless Ed Perkins,
followed by Clinton confidante Madeleine Albright, for whose inexperience
Hannay felt the need to cover, sometimes in an offensively obvious manner.
But then, subtlety was never Sir David's strong suit.
The typical self-confident Wykehamist, his abrasive bonhomie was given
particularly free rein when he represented Margaret Thatcher's government at
the EC between 1985 and 1990.
Hannay hands over to Sir John Weston, currently Britain's man at Nato.
Briefly political director of the Foreign Office during the Gulf war, Sir
John is credited with having persuaded John Major to intervene on behalf of
the Kurds. Lady Weston had watched what was happening on television, and
gave him no peace until he did something about it. Presumably she will not
be underemployed during her husband's next posting.
