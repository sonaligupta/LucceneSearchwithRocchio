FT  06 JUN 92 / Mexico to trim zeros from peso


   By DAMIAN FRASER


   MEXICO CITY


MEXICO is to eliminate three zeros from the peso from January, writes Damian
Fraser in Mexico City.
A Pounds 1.70 taxi ride will cost 10 rather than 10,100 pesos; the typical
chauffeur's wage will fall from 1,500,000 pesos a month to just 1,500;
Telmex, the national telephone company, will be worth a mere 90 billion,
rather than trillion, pesos.
Mr Milton Friedman, the Nobel laureate in economics, told worried Mexicans
the change was 'purely arithmetic' and would not affect inflation or wages.
The government said the only effect 'would be to simplify money transactions
and achieve a more efficient use for computing and registered accounting
systems'.
