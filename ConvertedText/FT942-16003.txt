FT  13 APR 94 / Telecoms deal 'ends monopoly set-up in EU'


   By ANDREW ADONIS


This week's deal between 30 of Europe's leading multinationals and a small
group of telecommunications operators marks the effective end of telecoms
monopolies in the European Union, the head of the Dutch state telecoms
company said yesterday.
The contract, for a private network linking the facilities of companies
including Rank Xerox, ICI, Philips, ABN Amro and ABB, was won by British
Telecommunications and an alliance of the US operator AT&T and Unisource, a
joint venture between the Swiss, Swedish and Dutch state telecoms companies.
Addressing an FT-sponsored conference in London, Mr Ben Verwaayen, president
of PTT Telecom Netherlands, said most large-user corporate telecoms users
would soon have an effective choice of carrier for much of their voice
traffic. This was despite the formal EU deadline of 1998 for ending
monopolies on voice services.
'Very soon you will have a situation that, however closed it may look today,
you will have alternative routings available,' Mr Verwaayen said. He added,
however, that effective competition in the residential market was likely to
develop far more slowly. 'The changes are more for those who give us large
volumes.'
This week's corporate contract, estimated to be worth up to Ecu500m (Pounds
393m) a year, exploits existing EU rules permitting private corporate
networks and obliging state telecoms companies to provide leased lines for
them.
This is allowing companies besides national monopolies to provide corporate
services, provided they do not use the public network.
Telecom Netherlands is about to be privatised, and a competitor to it is
likely to be licensed in the Netherlands soon.
