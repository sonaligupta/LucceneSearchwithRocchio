FT  29 APR 94 / UK Company News: VTR seeks Pounds 3m for expansion


   By DAVID WIGHTON


Shares in VTR, the video post-production house, rose 20p to 166p yesterday
on news of a Pounds 2.95m rights issue and trebled half-year profits.
The company has also applied for a move from the USM to a full listing.
Group pre-tax profits for the six months to end-February jumped from Pounds
202,000 to Pounds 697,000 on turnover up 38 per cent at Pounds 5.75m.
The interim dividend is lifted 21 per cent to 1.45p, payable from earnings
per share of 6p (1.7p).
The final distribution will be maintained at at least 2.55p on the enlarged
capital.
Mr John Banks, managing director, said the new funds would enable the group
to continue its capital investment programme and take advantage of possible
acquisition opportunities.
Capital expenditure has been running at about Pounds 2m a year, leaving the
company with net debt of Pounds 2.8m and gearing of 65 per cent at the end
of February.
The rights issue, fully underwritten by Greig Middleton, is on a 1-for-3
basis at 125p a share.
