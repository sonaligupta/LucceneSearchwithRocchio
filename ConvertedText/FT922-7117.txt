FT  20 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Traders move in on
higher yen and bonds

   TOKYO


EQUITIES gained further ground yesterday on the strength of the yen and
higher bond prices, activity centring on trading of 'environmental' and
bio-technology issues, while leading institutions stayed on the sidelines,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average was finally 311.01 ahead at 18,754.11, after opening at
the day's low of 18,479.53 and reaching a high of 18,775.79 just before the
close.
Volume rose from 216m shares to 320m. Traders said dealer activity led
trading, while investment trusts were seen bargain hunting. They added that
buying by foreign investors, who are reluctant to 'chase' stock prices
higher, has thinned out.
However, analysts said investor confidence was gradually recovering. Mr
Jason James, strategist at James Capel, commented: 'Investors, who
previously were only willing to buy at the 17,000 level, came in to buy at
the 18,000 level on Monday.'
Advances far outnumbered declines by 833 to 172, with 118 issues unchanged.
The Topix index of all first section stocks moved ahead 22.57 to 1,393.31,
and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 1.45 to 1,111.28.
Reports pointing to the possibility of postal insurance and annuity funds
investing directly into the stock market also encouraged investors.
Currently the funds can only be invested in the stock market through
designated money trust accounts.
According to James Capel, if the plan were permitted, the direct investment
by postal insurance funds could mean an inflow of Y5,000bn into the stock
market.
Buyers followed good company results. Traders said firm forecasts from some
companies were adding to the positive sentiment. Kyocera climbed Y120 to
Y4,490. The semiconductor component maker posted a 27 per cent fall in
pre-tax profits for the past fiscal year, but forecast a 6.8 per cent
increase for 1992/93.
Mitsubishi Kasei rose Y13 to Y447 in spite of a 53.4 per cent drop in
profits; it forecast a 5.4 per cent improvement for the current year.
Real estate issues continued to lose ground, with Mitsui Fudosan, which
announced a pre-tax loss for the first time in 16 years, dipping Y10 to
Y1,030, and Sumitomo Realty and Development, after posting a 31 per cent
fall in pre-tax profits, shedding Y4 to Y734.
Reports that Showa Denko would produce biodegradable plastic developed by
Showa Highpolymer sparked renewed interest in the environmental protection
theme. Showa Denko gained Y43 to Y340 and Japan Metals and Chemicals
appreciated Y20 to Y790.
In Osaka, the OSE average moved forward 315.15 to 21,347.42 in volume of
19.4m shares.
Roundup
THE worsening political situation in Bangkok had little negative influence
on Pacific Basin markets yesterday as sentiment was buoyed by a stronger
Tokyo. Manila registered a 1992 high.
HONG KONG traded in a narrow range and the Hang Seng index ended 5.15 up at
5,642.24 in HKDollars 3.23bn turnover.
Brokers said rumours about HSBC's exposure to O & Y, of Canada, caused the
bank to ease 25 cents to HKDollars 43.25.
MANILA reversed Monday's losses in active trade on bargain hunting. The
composite index rose 21.84 to 1,338.95 in combined turnover of 443.8m pesos.
SEOUL was held down by weakness in large-capitalisation issues. The
composite index eased 0.08 to 587.97 in turnover of Won346.32bn.
TAIWAN saw late buying in financials, which helped to push the weighted
index up 63.19 to 4,500.82. Turnover rose to TDollars 26.58bn from TDollars
22.67bn.
The market was buoyed by reports that the government might alter the stock
transaction tax. The financial sector gained 4 per cent, with First
Commercial Bank adding TDollars 6 at TDollars 106, after officials said last
week that they planned to ease curbs on banks doing business in China.
KUALA LUMPUR opened firmer and then wavered in a narrow range throughout
much of the day. The composite index edged up 0.57 to 590.91. Retail
investors again dominated trading as institutional support remained small.
Newly listed Peladang Kimia saw 6.2m shares traded and closed at MDollars
1.68 for a premium of 38 cents over its offer price.
AUSTRALIA declined in lacklustre trading. The All Ordinaries index lost 2.2
to 1,666.3 in turnover of ADollars 179.5m. Banks were weaker ahead of

to 2,205.1.

Australia, which releases its results tomorrow, dipped 10 cents to ADollars
7.95. ANZ, which reports next week, was off 7 cents at ADollars 4.36.
News Corp rose 12 cents to ADollars 21.62 on news that its UK satellite unit
had won the rights to televise games of the leading British football teams.
NEW ZEALAND recorded its seventh successive gain on the strength of firm
overseas markets and the weak New Zealand dollar. The NZSE-40 index added
13.24 at 1,552.69.
Newspaper shares did well, with Independent Newspapers firming 10 cents to
NZDollars 4.75.
SINGAPORE ended mixed in featureless trading. The Straits Times Industrial
index edged ahead 3.08 to 1,469.80.
