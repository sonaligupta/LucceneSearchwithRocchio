FT  16 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: Cazenove plans India fund


   By BETHAN HUTTON


Cazenove is hoping to raise Dollars 50m from investors in London and the
Gulf for a new closed-end Indian investment fund, to be managed by Chescor.
The Oryx fund will concentrate on medium-sized and smaller companies, with
more than 70 per cent in listed companies and about a quarter in unlisted
investments.
The fund will be based in Guernsey, but listed on the London Stock Exchange.
Investments will be made through Mauritius, to take advantage of its double
taxation treaty with India. The fund aims to be 90 per cent invested within
six months of launch.
Chescor is a small London-based investment house which has already been
involved in setting up an India fund for Martin Currie.
