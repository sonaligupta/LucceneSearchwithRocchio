   BERLIN


Mr Klaus Kinkel, Germany's foreign minister and leader of the Free Democrat
party, the junior partner in the governing coalition, yesterday warned FDP
party members that 'everything was at stake' in next October's federal
elections following a series of electoral defeats for the party. In a letter
to party members made public on Thursday, he urged them to ensure they do
not fall below the critical 5 per cent threshold necessary to win seats in
German legislatures. Mr Kinkel said 'the FDP is feeling the wind in its
face. But the liberals have also had to suffer setbacks in the past. We
overcame them by fighting. Complaining does not help.'
