FT  28 JUL 92 / Mancham disputes poll result


   By REUTER


   VICTORIA


SIR James Mancham, the former Seychelles president, cried foul yesterday
after losing an election to President Albert Rene, the man who overthrew him
15 years ago, Reuter reports from Victoria.
'We do not consider the election result credible,' said Sir James.
Sir James returned from exile this year to lead the Democratic party in the
contest for seats on a 20-member constitutional commission.
The vote on Sunday was the first multi-party poll for 18 years in this
cluster of 115 Indian Ocean islands.
A team of Commonwealth observers judged it free and fair but Sir James
accused Mr Rene's Seychelles Peoples Progressive Front of intimidating
voters.
Mr Rene's party won 58.4 per cent of the vote and will have 14 seats in the
commission, which is to write a new constitution before a presidential
election in December.
The Mancham campaign won 33.7 per cent and will have the remaining seats, as
none of the six other parties got the minimum for representation.
