FT  20 NOV 92 / Technology: Business travellers enter US quicker


   By EVELYN BRODIE


If you stagger from a transatlantic flight to face a long immigration queue
behind hundreds of tourists entering the US, then relief may be at hand,
writes Evelyn Brodie.
Next month the US Immigration and Naturalisation Service will issue
biometric cards to frequent business travellers from the US or elsewhere.
The cards contain nine pieces of information about the passenger's hand,
such as the length of the fingers. People with cards will go down a separate
aisle at immigration, insert the card into a machine and their hand into a
window. If they match, the traveller is admitted.
The cards will be used initially at two airports - Newark and JFK. INS: US,
202 514 2648.
