FT  24 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Comment hits media stocks


   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and COLIN MILLHAM


MARKETMAKERS worried by the relative strength in media stocks took their
chance to adjust prices yesterday. They seized on news that the Labour party
would launch a monopoly inquiry into cross-media ownership if it wins power
in the April 9 general election.
Pearson, Reed International and News International all fell sharply.
However, the turnovers of 250,000, 1m and 152,000 shares respectively
suggested that few genuine sellers were behind the falls. A partial recovery
left Pearson a net 13 off at 770p and Reed 14 down on the day at 499p.
Mr Rupert Murdoch's News International, the only company likely to be
seriously affected by a cross-media ownership review and believed to be
Labour's principal target, fell 12 to 341p.
Reed was also depressed by a profits forecast cut from agency broker James
Capel, which reduced its current year estimate from Pounds 225m to Pounds
217m. Capel said the change was not great in financial terms but had a
psychological effect as it brought the figure below last year's Pounds
221.8m.
Forth Ports debut
Scottish port operator Forth Ports came to the market yesterday and was the
third most heavily traded stock. The shares surged above the offer price of
110p to close at 122p. Volume was a heavy 9m, which equates to around 31 per
cent of equity.
The group, which was owned by the UK government, operates all the ports in
the Firth of Forth and last year made pre-tax profits of Pounds 6.2m.
Although profits are expected to decline this year - mainly because of a
fall in orders for British Pipe Coaters, which treats pipes at Leith -
analysts are generally enthusiastic about Forth's prospects.
Mr Mark Laurence at Smith New Court said: 'The price of the placing will
ensure a strong following for the stock, and we think a fundamental value of
Forth could support a share price of around 145p.'
Drugs feature
Sharp polarity in the performances of Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham left a
number of observers slightly bemused as there seemed to be no specific
stories driving the stock prices.
At first sight, investors appeared to be switching from one stock to the
other. However, the impetus came, as it often does, from New York.
US securities houses were strong buyers of Glaxo, partly on weakness, partly
because a number of them - Smith Barney for example - are continually
reiterating their buy stance on the shares, and partly because nervousness
over the forthcoming UK general election is promoting a return to defensive
stocks. Glaxo shares jumped 18 to 782p.
SmithKline has a large exposure to consumer recovery, or the lack of it, in
the UK. It reacted, yesterday, to heavy selling of the Units on Friday. The
'A' shares dropped 22 to 855p while the Units slid 112 further to 3928p.
A report that oil reserves in Colombia's Cusiana oil field may be smaller
than expected hurt shares in BP, which has a 40 per cent interest in the
field. The stock lost 4 to 258p on turnover of 5.9m, also dampened by County
NatWest reiterating its negative stance at the house morning meeting.
Royal Insurance moved against the general trend and rose 4 to 174p following
a buy recommendation from County NatWest.
Mr David Nisbet, County's insurance analyst, changed his short-term stance
to buy from hold. He said the stock was trading at 'almost half its net
asset value' and argued that, although there were risks attached, its
discount to asset value should be closer to 40 per cent. This would put the
share price at around Pounds 2, he added.
The running saga over British Aerospace's long-promised Saudi Arabian
defence contract continued to drag the group down as talk in the market
suggested further delays - and possible cancellations - to the signing. BAe,
14 weaker at one stage, recovered to 291p for a fall of 10 on the day.
Aerospace, cargo handling and electronic component distributor ML Holdings
received the unwelcome attention of TT Group as the latter took a 7 per cent
stake. ML, whose shares collapsed from 53p after its interims in January,
rose 7 to 28p. TT was steady at 200p.
Dividend hopes helped Bridon add 4 at 89p. Reports that Smith New Court had
turned a seller of British Steel left the stock 2 1/2 easier at 75p after
busy turnover of 11m.
BET advanced 6 to 131p on news of the appointment of Sir Christopher Harding
as chairman. The stock was also helped by sentiment that the dividend would
be maintained.
Further nervousness at Harland Simon - the group issued a profits warning in
February - saw the shares drop 28 to 103p.
Selected property shares were sold as the swing towards Labour in the
opinion polls unnerved some investors with the feeling that a Labour
government would prolong the sector's plight. British Land lost 14 to 189p
as a big line of stock went through. Land Securities slipped 9 to 394p, and
Hammerson 'A' 8 to 405p. Sentiment was also unhinged by the problems at
Olympia & York.
There was further recovery in Guinness after the initial caution that
followed last week's figures. The shares firmed 3 to 561p in a subdued
brewing and drinks sector. The main reason for the earlier caution was
Guinness's suggestion that there is unlikely to be a speedy end to the
recession in its major whisky markets.
This view was echoed by Macallan-Glenlivet, the much smaller but prestigious
malt whisky producer. Like Guinness, yesterday's figures for 1991 were good,
with profits rising to Pounds 6.36m from Pounds 5.34m, but it warned that
trading conditions remain difficult. The shares slipped 12 to 163p.
British Airways' purchase of a German airline helped it to gain 5 to 253p.
The move will strengthen BA's position in the German regional commuter
market.
Stores conglomerate Kingfisher bucked the downward trend, holding at 466p
ahead of tomorrow's results, which some analysts fear will fail to equal
last year's profits of Pounds 215.3m.
Market predictions of profits around the Pounds 60m mark proved fairly
accurate for Argos, which turned in Pounds 62.09 pre-tax for 1991, compared
with Pounds 75.11m previously. Strong cash flow allowed the company to
increase its dividend but the shares fell 4 to 253p as analysts worried that
it may be losing its 'value for money image'.
