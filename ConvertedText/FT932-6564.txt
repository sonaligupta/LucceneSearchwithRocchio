1.2 per cent

EQUITIES climbed 1.2 per cent on institutional buying in spite of the yen's
advance against the dollar, writes Wayne Aponte in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average ended 264.23 higher at 20,895.99, after dipping to a
day's low of 20,527.96. The Topix index rose 21.43 to 1,639.72 and in London
the ISE/Nikkei 50 index gained 7.43 at 1,263.87.
Volume was 470m shares compared to Tuesday's 437m, while rises led falls by
743 to 292, with 152 issues unchanged.
Brokers said some investors had bought shares on speculation that the yen's
rise against the dollar would encourage the Bank of Japan to cut interest
rates. The yen closed at Y108.65 to the dollar in Tokyo.
However, an analyst at a Japanese securities house said that equity markets
had already discounted foreign exchange rate considerations. The yen, he
added, is expected to weaken during the latter half of this year.
The banking sector was strong after long-term credit banks increased their
prime lending rates: Industrial Bank of Japan moved ahead Y140 to Y2,880 and
Mitsubishi Bank Y100 to Y2,680.
Brokerages benefited from the buying interest in banking issues: Nomura rose
Y60 to Y2,180, Nikko Y50 to Y1,120, Daiwa Y50 to Y1,340 and Nikko Y50 to
Y1,120.
Keisei Electric Railway moved Y20 higher to Y1,350 on a report that its
affiliate, Oriental Land - which runs Tokyo Disneyland - and Walt Disney, of
the US, had agreed to build another theme park in Tokyo.
Investors bought the shares of some cement companies on suggestions that an
imminent passage of the supplementary budget by the lower house will
translate into more public works projects and a revival of the cement
industry. Sumitomo appreciated Y19 to Y652 and Onada Y23 to Y667.
Profit-taking pushed TDK, the world's largest manufacturer of magnetic
tapes, Y130 lower to Y3,810, partly on its recent 43 per cent drop in
pre-tax profits and partly on the day's rise in the yen.
In Osaka, the OSE average added 91.10 at 22,902.92 in volume of 28.4m
shares.
