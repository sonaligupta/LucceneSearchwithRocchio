FT  05 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Norton seeks share relisting


   By JANE FULLER


NORTON Group, the engineering concern that includes the famous motorcycle
marque, is meeting its bank plus brokers and institutions today to discuss
the rescheduling of debt and relisting of shares.
The shares were suspended in March last year at 18p after a delay in
publishing results and the launching of a Department of Trade and Industry
investigation.
Mr Norman Wilson, one of the directors appointed since the suspension, said
annual trading losses in Norton Motors, which makes rotary engines and
motorcycles, had been reduced from about Pounds 2m to Pounds 47,000. Pro-Fit
Piping Components, a US subsidiary, had made a trading profit.
The relisting was linked with efforts to reschedule the group's borrowings,
which amounted to some Pounds 6m. Midland Bank is the main lender.
Norton's troubles came to a head with a poorly supported Pounds 6.5m rights
issue to fund the purchase of FUS Beteiligungs und Verwaltungs, a German
fasteners maker. This proved controversial because the vendor was a Channel
Islands trust company set up to benefit the children of the then chairman,
Mr James Tildesley. He resigned in April last year.
Mr Wilson said FUS - 'an albatross around Norton's neck' - had been sold for
a nominal amount to get rid of the accompanying liabilities.
The DTI said yesterday that its investigation was well advanced.
