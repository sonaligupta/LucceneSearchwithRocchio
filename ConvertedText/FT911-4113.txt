FT  20 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (America): Profit-taking predominant in
active trading

   NEW YORK


Wall Street
SHARE prices fell further from Wednesday's record highs as investors seized
the opportunity yesterday morning to realise profits earned during the
recent rally, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 33.67 at 2,965.59,
having spent all morning in negative territory. The broader indices were
also notably weaker, with the Standard & Poor's 500 down 4.26 at 384.20, and
the Nasdaq composite of over the counter stocks down 5.46 at 501.16.
Turnover on the New York SE was 198m shares, and declining shares outpaced
rising shares by almost two to one, evidence of the weak underlying tone.
Analysts were not surprised by yesterday's declines, arguing that the market
was due for a correction following its impressive performance in the first
half of April. The dollar's strength, which hurts overseas earnings of many
US companies (especially blue-chips), also depressed sentiment. Selling
linked to expiration of stock index futures and options contracts added to
downward pressure on prices.
In a banking sector weakened by investors taking profits after recent gains,
American Express was the most heavily traded stock, falling Dollars 1 7/8 to
Dollars 27 5/8 on turnover of 2.6m shares. Late on Thursday the group
reported profits of 55 cents a share for the quarter, in line with analysts'
expectations and up from the big loss incurred a year earlier.
Citicorp was also well traded, easing Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 15 7/8 on
turnover of 2m shares. BankAmerica, another to report a recovery in first
quarter earnings this week, fell back Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 38 1/4 , while
Chase Manhattan dropped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 19 3/8 .
Kellogg rose Dollars 2 early on but fell back to end unchanged at Dollars 95
1/2 after the company announced profits of Dollars 1.35 a share for its
latest quarter, against the 79 cents a share earned at the same stage in
1990. The figures were above market expectations.
Colgate-Palmolive fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 82 5/8 in spite of reporting
record first quarter sales and earnings. The 12 per cent increase in first
quarter net income to Dollars 91.3m came as no surprise, and like many other
leading stocks Colgate fell back on profit-taking.
Shares in 3M, formerly Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, eased Dollars 1
to Dollars 87 3/4 in the wake of the company's first decline in quarterly
earnings for seven years. Although 3M said it expected an improvement in the
second half of 1991, it could not guarantee earnings growth over the period.
IGI rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 11 7/8 on the American Stock Exchange on
positive reaction to the meetings for investors held recently in New York by
the biotechnology/healthcare company.
Canada
TORONTO share prices declined on a broad front in moderate trading,
registering the largest one-day decline in about six months. The TSE 300
composite finished the session off 37.96 to 3495.97, down about 14 points
over the week.
Declines were far ahead of gainers, by 355 to 235, and volume of 31,065,000
shares was below the previous day's 35,406,000 shares.
