   By REUTER


   WASHINGTON


PRESIDENT Bush yesterday named Mr Daniel Goldin, whom he described as a
leader in the US aerospace industry, as head of the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (Nasa), Reuter reports from Washington.
Mr Goldin is a senior vice-president in TRW, the US defence company, and has
been general manager of its space and technology division since 1987.
He will replace Nasa chief Admiral Richard Truly, a former astronaut forced
out of the agency in a power struggle with vice-president Dan Quayle's
National Space Council. Admiral Truly was in charge of rehabilitating Nasa
after the 1986 Challenger disaster and headed the space agency for two
years.
During Mr Goldin's tenure at TRW the company has built 13 spacecraft which
are still in orbit, including a tracking and data relay satellite.
