FT  23 JUL 93 / International Company News: Surge at Anglo American


   By PHILIP GAWITH


GOLD mines in the Anglo American group, the world's largest gold producer,
increased available profit by 19.7 per cent to R251.1m (Dollars 76m) in the
June quarter, compared with the preceding March quarter.
The profits advance stemmed from higher production - up by 1.1 per cent to
67,803kg - a 4.7 per cent increase in average revenue to R36,327 per kg and
a modest increase in total working costs to R1.83bn from R1.79bn.
Although the impact of hedging dilutes the full benefit of the recent firm
gold price on profits, the large dividend increases at some mines - up by
155 per cent at Western Deep Levels and 100 per cent at Elandsrand - are a
clear indication of the better times in the industry.
All five mines in the group increased profits after tax and capital
expenditure.
Available profit rose by 11 per cent at Freegold to R102.5m: by 27 per cent
to R70.7m at Vaal Reefs: by 17 per cent to R38.1m at Western Deep Levels: by
51 per cent to R28.7m at Elandsrand and by 12 per cent to R11.1m at Ergo.
