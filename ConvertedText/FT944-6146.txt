FT  30 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Leigh Interests advances 3% to Pounds 5.2m


   By GEOFF DYER


Increased earnings from dry waste collection and landfill operations helped
Leigh Interests, the waste management company, to raise interim pre-tax
profits by 3 per cent.
Profits rose to Pounds 5.2m, against Pounds 5.06m, in the six months to
September 30, but were held by falling margins in liquid waste disposal.
Total turnover was also 3 per cent ahead at Pounds 58m (Pounds 56.4m).
Profits were affected by an operating loss of Pounds 670,000 on two new
waste plants in the Midlands.
The Four Ashes incineration plant has now been completed and is expected to
contribute to profits in the second half.
Mr Arthur Kent, finance director, said that customer demand in the dry waste
sector had grown and landfill prices at some sites in the country had
increased by 20 per cent.
Coal extraction and processing also showed 'small but useful' increases in
profitability and turnover. Margins in the liquid waste sector continued to
decline, because of greater competition. The company hopes to benefit from
tighter regulations, including the yet-to-be implemented EU Landfill
Directive, which requires liquid waste to be disposed of at treatment
plants.
Earnings per share and interim dividend were both unchanged at 5.5p and
2.46p respectively.
