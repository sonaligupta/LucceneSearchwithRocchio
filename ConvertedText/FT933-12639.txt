FT  23 JUL 93 / The Maastricht Vote: Leading bankers tell Major adopting the
social chapter would be 'a serious mistake'


LEADING bankers yesterday told Mr John Major that it would be 'a serious
mistake' for Britain to adopt the social chapter.
In a fax to Downing Street they told the prime minister: 'We are concerned
about attempts being made to graft the social chapter on to our obligations.
We think this would be a serious mistake.
'It is vital for all of us in this country to play our full part in
influencing the future development of Europe, but we in the City also have
the greatest interest in the competitiveness of British business and
industry.
'We consider that the social chapter would damage this competitiveness. Its
aims are far best considered and decided on by individual countries. For the
European Commission to do so would be a recipe for inflexibility and for a
higher regulatory burden.'
Those who signed it are: Lord Alexander of Weedon (National Westminster); Mr
Andrew Buxton (Barclays); Sir Nicholas Goodison (TSB); Sir Robin Ibbs
(Lloyds); Mr Bruce Pattullo (Bank of Scotland); Lord Stewartby (Standard
Chartered); Sir Christopher Tugendhat (Abbey National); Sir Peter Walters
(Midland) and Lord Younger of Prestwick (Royal Bank of Scotland).
