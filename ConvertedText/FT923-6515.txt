FT  24 AUG 92 / Arts: Today's Television


   By ANTONY THORNCROFT


Very rarely do television travel programmes hit the mark - there is usually
a nagging feeling that the narrator and crew have brought the life style of
Hampstead, or, in Alan Whicker's case, Mayfair, to the part of the world
they are theoretically exploring.
You can never really forget that however shrilly the front man squeals there
are a cameraman and producer and all the comforts of civilisation close at
hand.
A new series of Traveller's Tales does little to dispel the doubts. Six
'characters' were allowed to visit a country of their choice. Nigel Farrell
kicks off with a trip on Lake Malawi.
Since the country rarely enters the news this opener sounds promising but
Farrell actually has a nice time drifting along on a lake steamer, and the
programme ends up exposing Farrell rather than the destination. (Channel 4,
9.00).
Nature Special (BBC2, 8.30) examines the last-minute attempts to save the
London Zoo by making it more environmentally friendly.
Only a late flurry of visitors in the next few weeks can produce the revenue
to enable the zoo to make the transition into a conservationist paradise.
