Sales of new cars and light trucks in the US rose by more than 8 per cent
last year to around 14.2m, the highest level since 1989, according to
provisional industry figures.
Sales rose by 1.1m from 13.1m in 1992 and 12.5m in 1991, the low point of
the last recession. The US market peaked at 16.3m in 1986.
The strengthening recovery in the US new vehicle market is in stark contrast
to the steep fall in demand in Europe last year and the further drop in new
vehicle sales in Japan, where demand has fallen for three years in
succession.
The increase in sales in the US has been driven by the surge in demand for
light trucks, such as pick-ups, mini-vans (multi-purpose vehicles), vans and
four-wheel drive sports/utility vehicles, now accounting for about 40 per
cent of the US passenger vehicle market.
Light truck sales, still dominated by the big three US vehicle makers,
General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, rose 16 per cent last year to a record
5.7m; car sales rose 4 per cent to 8.5m.
US carmakers outperformed the market with a 10.4 per cent increase in new
vehicle sales. Japanese carmakers have been forced to increase prices faster
than their US rivals.
Under pressure from the strong appreciation in the value of the yen, the
Japanese have lost market share.
The rapid improvement in the fortunes of the domestic US vehicle makers was
led by Chrysler, the smallest of the big three, which increased its total
vehicle sales 19.9 per cent to 2.047m from 1.71m a year earlier.
Sales of light trucks by Chrysler accounted for 59 per cent of its total
sales volume last year but the company is strengthening its position in the
car market with the launch of a series of new cars this year, including the
Neon small car and the Chrysler Cirrus/Dodge Stratus large family cars,
which were unveiled this week at the Detroit motor show.
Chrysler, which is undertaking a rapid renewal of its product range,
increased its car sales last year by 23.1 per cent to 834,132, while its
light truck sales rose 17.8 per cent to 1.2m.
Ford also performed strongly and accounted for five of the top 10
best-selling vehicles in the US. Its full-sized F-series pick-up was the
best-selling vehicle in the US at 565,000, while the Ford Taurus was the
best-selling car at 360,000, ahead of the Honda Accord at 330,000.
Ford's total vehicle sales increased 12 per cent to 3.6m. Its car sales
increased by 6 per cent to 1.878m, while light truck sales rose by 19.4 per
cent to 1.68m.
General Motors, the world's biggest vehicle maker, suffered a further small
erosion of its US market share to about 33 per cent. Its total vehicle sales
rose 5.9 per cent to 4.7m.
GM, whose North American automotive operations are being drastically
restructured after several years of heavy losses, increased its new car
sales by 2 per cent to 2.93m, while its truck sales increased 13 per cent to
1.79m.
Among the Japanese car makers, Honda's sales in the US fell 7.3 per cent
last year to 717,000. Total vehicle sales by Toyota, including its Lexus
luxury car division, increased 1.3 per cent to 1.033m. Sales of cars under
the Toyota brand fell 2.1 per cent.
Nissan, the second biggest Japanese car maker, staged a strong recovery
after falling behind its Japanese rivals in the US, and its total sales,
including the Infiniti luxury car division, rose 17.9 per cent to 680,000.
