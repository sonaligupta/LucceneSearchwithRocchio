FT  12 NOV 92 / World Trade News: British videophones to be sold in Japan


   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO


BRITISH videophones are to be sold in Japan under an agreement reached
yesterday between GEC-Marconi, the defence electronics manufacturer, and
Mitsui, the Japanese trading company. Only rarely do UK-made consumer
electronics products enter the Japanese market.
GEC-Marconi, which is making videophones for BT in Britain, has been working
to sell its product in other markets in order to establish its technology as
a de facto international standard for analogue videophones. No such standard
yet exists.
Mitsui will also market in Japan GEC-Marconi's video compression technology.
This makes it possible to send moving video pictures down the telephone
line.
The videophones can be plugged into a normal socket and will act like an
ordinary telephone if the person being called does not have a videophone.
GEC-Marconi has won agreements to market its phones in the US, Hong Kong and
possibly Singapore.
