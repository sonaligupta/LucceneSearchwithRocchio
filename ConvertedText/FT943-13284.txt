FT  20 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Baring fund receives Ecu353m


   By RICHARD GOURLAY


Baring Capital Investors, the venture capital group, yesterday announced it
has received commitments worth Ecu353m (Pounds 279m) for a new fund to
invest in large management buy-outs in Europe.
The group expects to have raised about Ecu450m by the time it closes the
Baring Capital Partners fund in the autumn. Some 90 per cent of the
commitments come from investors in its existing funds.
Charterhouse, Morgan Grenfell and Candover all recently raised large funds
for management buy-outs.
Some observers of the venture capital industry say the large end of the
buy-out market is becoming overcrowded with new funds chasing a relatively
small number of big deals.
They feel this could increase competition and might lead to deals being
structured with a larger proportions of debt, thereby increasing their
riskiness.
Few observers believe, however, that the ratios of debt to equity will rise
from the current levels of about one to one to the levels of leverage seen
in the late 1980s, when some banks were providing over 80 per cent of the
finance for deals.
Mr Otto van der Wyck, chief executive of Baring Capital, said he did not
believe the UK market was becoming overcrowded, and added that Baring was
also investing in continental Europe where there are fewer suppliers of
venture capital for large deals.
He said he did not believe the large venture capital suppliers, currently
having to compete with corporate buyers, were bidding up the prices of
potential MBO companies.
