FT  27 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions boost for Allied London


   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE


A series of acquisitions over the past year boosted annual results at Allied
London Properties, which yesterday posted pre-tax profits 56 per cent ahead
at Pounds 10.6m, against Pounds 6.8m last time.
But net asset value per share of 110p (85p) came in below market
expectations and contributed to an 8p fall in the shares to 100p.
The results for the year to June 30 confirmed the first half trend and
yesterday Sir Geoffrey Leigh, chairman, said that the outlook remained 'very
favourable' for both capital values and the rental market.
The 12 per cent rise in rental income to Pounds 21.94m (Pounds 19.52m) was
derived substantially from the group's Pounds 52m worth of acquisitions.
These included an Pounds 11.3m portfolio in Glasgow for its newly
established Scottish subsidiary. A further five properties have been bought
in the region since the year-end at a cost of just over Pounds 9m.
The company also spent Pounds 34.35m on six properties from Provident
Mutual, which in return paid Pounds 21.6m on a portfolio of Allied's retail
portfolio. Sir Geoffrey said the balance of Pounds 12.75m had produced a net
annual rent of Pounds 1.8m.
There were also big investments in properties in Leeds and Basingstoke.
Pelham Homes, the former Rosehaugh subsidiary, was bought from the receiver
for Pounds 3m, which brought with it a substantial land bank in the
south-east.
The year-end valuation on the group's portfolio was 6.7 per cent higher at
Pounds 220m than the previous year. Offices comprised 52 per cent of the
properties, followed by business parks, light industrial and warehouses at
39 per cent and retail 9 per cent.
A final dividend of 2.7p is to be paid, making a total of 3.88p (3.53p).
