FT  01 JUL 92 / International Company News: PaineWebber warns of lower
profits


   By PATRICK HARVERSON


   NEW YORK


IN THE first indication that Wall Street's phenomenal earnings growth of the
past year may be slowing, PaineWebber, the retail broking house, said
yesterday that its profit in the second quarter would be below first-quarter
levels.
Mr Donald Marron, chairman, said the company would report net income of
between Dollars 45m and Dollars 47m for April to June, down from the record
Dollars 74.3m earned in the first three months of the year.
Second-quarter earnings, however, would still be better than a year ago,
when the company made Dollars 33.8m.
Total revenues of around Dollars 580m will also be sharply lower than in the
first quarter, when revenues totalled Dollars 874.3m. Although its
performance measures unfavourably against the first quarter, the overall
state of the securities business remains strong.
Although Mr Marron gave no specific reason for the fall in quarterly
earnings, individual investor activity in US markets has slowed from the
high levels seen in late 1991 and early 1992. Recent sales of stock funds
have shrunk compared to first-quarter levels, as a stagnant equity market
and rising bond yields made stocks look less attractive.
Commission revenues, recurring fee business and broker productivity,
however, remain strong, says PaineWebber.
Asset management remains an increasingly important part of its business,
with repeat fees, mostly from managing customer assets, running at levels 20
per cent higher than a year ago. The company currently has just under
Dollars 100bn of assets in custody.
PaineWebber said it remained committed to keeping a lid on costs, but it had
increased its workforce recently, hiring about 390 new brokers and
institutional salesmen in the past year.
