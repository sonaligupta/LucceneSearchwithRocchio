FT  17 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: UK unemployment


Yesterday's unemployment figures are perhaps of more political than economic
significance. The seasonally adjusted increase of 31,100 in December might
be taken as further evidence that the feared double dip is not
materialising, even though it took the national rate of unemployment to 9
per cent. But it is instructive to look at regional variations. More than
half the monthly rise was in south-east England, where the concentration of
marginal constituencies makes the government particularly vulnerable. By
contrast, unemployment in the north-west, where there is another less
publicised group of marginal conservative seats, is barely rising.
It would be tempting to conclude that this is simply a case of swings and
roundabouts, were it not for the fact that the north-west still has one of
the highest rates of unemployment in the country. Small wonder that the
employment minister preferred to focus on the increase in job vacancies.
