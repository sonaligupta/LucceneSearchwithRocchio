   MANAMA


UN experts travel to Baghdad today to begin overseeing the destruction of
machinery Iraq used to produce its arsenal of chemical bombs, officials
said, Reuter reports from Manama.
A 16-member team would supervise the scrapping of 60 pieces of equipment
used to make chemical bomb casings. The team would also inspect undeclared
sites during their eight-day mission to search for hidden equipment. UN
inspectors charged with ridding Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction have
already destroyed about 8,000 unfilled chemical munitions and blown up
leaking rockets containing 2.5 tonnes of nerve agents.
