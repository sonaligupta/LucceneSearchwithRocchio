FT  21 APR 94 / Money launder reports double


   By ALISON SMITH


The number of reports to UK authorities about suspected money-laundering
activities has more than doubled in two years, from 5,000 in 1991 to 12,700
last year, Alison Smith writes. About 80 per cent of such reports come from
the four main clearing banks and the TSB.
At the start of a three-day London meeting of the international Financial
Action Task Force, UK agencies involved in fighting money laundering said
that greater awareness of the problem had contributed to the rise in
reports. The taskforce was set up in 1989 in response to the growth of
international money laundering.
The UK agencies expect another sharp rise in reports this year - after
further tough regulations on disclosure of suspicions about money
laundering, which came into effect this month.
They added, however, that there were signs that some 'dirty' cash was being
withdrawn from the UK because Britain had tightened up its response to money
laundering.
This issue was highlighted by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, as one of
the reasons why the international taskforce was so important.
Speaking at the meeting, he said: 'Of course, even firm government action,
if it is carried out in isolation, carries the risk that the launderers will
simply move their activities elsewhere.'
