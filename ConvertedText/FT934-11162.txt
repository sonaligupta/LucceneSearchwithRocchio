FT  02 NOV 93 / Ealing owner plans revival of film-making at studios


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


PLANS were announced yesterday to revive film-making at the birthplace of
classic British films such as Passport to Pimlico, Whisky Galore and Scott
of the Antarctic.
The new owners of Ealing Studios - where nearly 100 films were made between
1929 and its purchase by the BBC in 1957 - hope to use Business Expansion
Scheme funds to make Ealing a fully operational studio again. The aim is to
make up to 10 films a year.
After the era of Sir Michael Balcon, the most famous Ealing producer, the
BBC made television programmes there, including The Singing Detective,
Fortunes of War and Colditz.
Mr David Bill's BBRK group, which owns scenery, lighting and special-effects
companies, bought the studios from the BBC for Pounds 6m last December.
'We have a huge responsibility here,' Mr Bill said. 'When we're not aware of
the ghost of Michael Balcon, the shadow of the BBC looms large. Some of
their greatest work was done here.'
The group hopes to raise Pounds 750,000 to develop Ealing movies. The BES
scheme allows tax-free investments ranging from Pounds 500 to Pounds 40,000.
Possible ventures include a thriller about Lord Lucan and a children's film
directed by actor Bob Hoskins. The studio has entered into a trading
relationship with Screen Partners, which will provide deficit finance.
Although BES funds have helped finance films such as Henry V and Leon The
Pig Farmer, Ealing Studios said yesterday it was the first time they had
been used for a studio-based development.
The money will be invested in Ealing Studios Productions and investors are
being promised stakes in a 'varied five-year portfolio' of films.
Last night Hollywood director Martin Scorsese, speaking of his career at a
London lecture - paid tribute to the effect of the Ealing influence.
