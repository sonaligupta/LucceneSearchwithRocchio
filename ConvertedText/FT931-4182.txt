FT  12 MAR 93 / Two Japanese companies announce job cuts totalling 4,000


Two Japanese companies yesterday announced job cuts totalling 4,000 as the
government prepared to release economic growth figures for the final quarter
of last year which are expected to be the worst in nearly two decades, write
Michiyo Nakamoto and Charles Leadbeater.
Kyocera, Japan's leading bioceramics manufacturer, plans to cut its
workforce by about 1,000 to 13,000 within two years, while Sumitomo Metal
Industries plans a reduction of 3,000 to 22,000 by 1996.
The companies' announcements come amid the worst deterioration in corporate
profits since the oil shocks of 1975.
A survey of more than 22,000 companies released yesterday by the finance
ministry found that average pre-tax profits fell by 39.4 per cent in the
final quarter of last year, the 10th consecutive quarterly drop and the
steepest fall since the first quarter of 1975.
The figures for gross national product to be published today are widely
expected to show that the Japanese economy contracted by about 1 per cent,
the worst since 1974 when GNP fell 0.8 per cent.
Meanwhile a survey of more than 4,000 employers by the labour ministry found
that 39 per cent had cut labour costs in the final months of last year. The
most popular measures were cuts in overtime.
However the measures announced recently confirm than Japanese industry is
embarked on a round of much deeper cost cutting to arrest the protracted
decline in profitability.
