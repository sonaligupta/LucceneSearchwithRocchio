FT  29 APR 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (25): Banks woo the
new stockmarket investor - Buying shares / Four big clearers are said to
account for 40 per cent of the private-client retail market / High Street
Investment


   By JOANNA SLAUGHTER


Anyone rash enough to suggest that the banks have been overtaken in the
scramble to compete for the affections of the new audience of stockmarket
investors is likely to receive a dusty answer.
The stockbroking arms of the high street banks admit that the banks took
some time to come off their starting blocks, but they argue that they are
now firmly in the race. According to Robert Froy, managing director of
Lloyds Bank Stockbrokers, the four major clearing banks account for around
40 per cent of the private client retail market.
Froy comments: 'It has been a very interesting experience for the banks,
which are not naturally inclined to this kind of entrepreneurial activity.
But I think they have overcome that. We have the perceived integrity, and we
have the capital resources to invest in the technology that is needed.'
Justin Urquhart Stewart, director of planning and business development at
Barclays Stockbrokers, adds: 'Traditionally, banks have always had business
going through their branches, which they fed out to local stockbrokers, but
then they woke up to the fact that they were giving away client names,
capital money and 75 per cent of the commission. When we set up Barclays
Stockbrokers, it involved taking a scythe out and cutting off these
relationships.'
Clive Wood, director and general manager of Midland Stockbrokers, believes
that banks have also brought 'some pretty slick systems' into the market. He
says: 'Banks recognised the importance of systems. When they first came into
this in the mid-1980s, there was a settlement backlog and every deal was a
complaint.'
To an extent, too, banks have had the advantage of a captive audience
through their branch networks, although critics claim that they have failed
to exploit this. Bankers would deny the charge, pointing to the fact that
NatWest, for instance, has touch-screens to sell shares in 280 of its
branches, and a telephone-based share-dealing system in the remaining 1,500.
'We average about 3,000 bargains a day,' says Carol Griffiths, NatWest's
controller of savings and investments. 'One in eight share deals is done
through Natwest.'
However, there is some agreement that there may be a shift in the role of
the branch as a simple source of clients. For instance, Froy foresees the
day when bank customers will be able to deal in shares by putting a smart
card in the wall.
Wood believes that the success of telephone dealing services may also lessen
the importance of the branch network.
Midland's Teletrade service is designed for non-Midland customers, and the
bank has recently launched a promotional campaign for the service.
Banks are also trying to develop their share-dealing client base by building
niche services. Likely expansion areas are more provision of advice, the
linking of share-dealing with banks' trustee and nominee services, and the
linking of stock settlement with bank statements.
Urquhart Stewart points out that personalised advice can be priced very
cheaply by banks, 'because the research is already there. A lot of people
want a direct opinion: is it a buy, or is it a sell? More to the point is
the question: 'Is it a buy or a sell, given what I've got?'.'
'We used to focus on investment advice,' says Wood, 'but if you watch the
telephone calls, what people are really desperate for is information. We
don't charge separately for advice. It is a bit of a loss leader, but we are
happy to give information and advice free, as we hope and expect to get the
business.'
Froy says Lloyds Stockbrokers offers 'perfectly adequate advice' over the
telephone. 'Our free advice sets us apart from the others, but I am not
certain that a great number of clients want advice.'
Urquhart Stewart also believes that the expansion of company share schemes -
'the next big growth area of wider and deeper share ownership' - will
present banks with particular marketing opportunities. 'We can provide both
the SAYE contract and the Corporate Pep,' he says. 'Our aim is to make the
share ownership pond a lake.'
All banks will have to decide how far they are prepared to compete on price,
in order to expand their share-dealing businesses, however. Charges for
their telephone services are being undercut by a number of competitors,
including building societies such as the Yorkshire, National & Provincial
and Halifax; and, as Froy says, 'the almost finite number of investors are
now doing the rounds to see where they can do their deals most cheaply.'
Urquhart Stewart comments: 'Price-cutting is in vogue, because firms are
buying market share, but market share of what? Abbey National, TSB and
British Gas are the main shares traded. They are chasing down the lower end
of the market.'
'I'm not going to lose any money on price,' says Wood. 'I will make money by
capturing a reasonably large slice of the market, but l am certainly not
going to compete with a Pounds 9 bargain. I will be competing on price, but
I'll also be competing on service.'
'There are always people for whom price is important,' agrees NatWest's
Griffiths, 'but we think accessibility may be more important than price. We
offer one of the cheapest services around, anyway, with our Pounds 9.99 post
service for those for whom the price of dealing is of paramount importance.'
Froy concludes: 'What Lloyds Bank Stockbrokers offer is good administration.
We make sure we pay clients on time, and we deal at a good price.'
