FT  28 JUL 92 / Dock workers lose union recognition


   By DAVID GOODHART


ASSOCIATED British Ports, one of Britain's largest docks employers, has
withdrawn recognition rights from the transport union RMT. The move is a
further step in the company's campaign to put all staff on to personal
contracts.
Although 650 of the company's 2,000 staff are nominally members of the
union, only 90 have refused to sign the personal contracts which require
them to give up all their rights to union representation.
Until now the union has continued to bargain on behalf of the 90 - who are
mainly manual workers in Cardiff, Swansea and Newport, south Wales - but the
company has now written to the RMT saying that it will no longer be
recognised for collective bargaining or individual disciplinary issues.
Lawyers for the union believe that the company may have decided to go ahead
after the Employment Appeal Tribunal recently upheld an appeal by Associated
Newspapers, publishers of the Daily Mail, against the National Union of
Journalists.
