FT  13 APR 92 / Japanese banks hit Basle threshold


   By SIMON LONDON


THE latest decline of Tokyo equity prices has left many Japanese banks short
of international capital adequacy standards which come into full force next
year.
A report by IBCA, the London-based credit rating agency which specialises in
the banking sector, said that the fall in the Nikkei stock market index
below 17,000 last week left virtually all Japanese banks below the 8 per
cent capital-to-assets ratio demanded by the Basle Accord on international
capital adequacy.
Analysts at Daiwa Securities in London also calculate that the average
capital ratio of Japanese banks is now just below the threshold demanded by
the international agreement.
IBCA noted that a fall in the Nikkei to around the 15,000 level would wipe
out the hidden reserves of some banks, including Bank of Tokyo, forcing them
to take valuation losses by writing down equity investments.
'If the authorities were to rigidly insist on maintaining capital ratios,
the Japanese banks would have to dramatically reduce lending. They have
already done this on the international scene but so far there are no signs
of a credit crunch in Japan,' the report said.
There are no international sanctions in place against banks which fail to
meet the Basle targets.
However, regulators are already concerned that they have inadequate control
over foreign bank branches operating in their jurisdiction.
