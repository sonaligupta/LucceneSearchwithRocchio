FT  18 JAN 92 / Arts: They're playing his song - Michael Arditti talks to
the English musical's forgotten man, Vivian Ellis


   By MICHAEL ARDITTI


VIVIAN Ellis's mother was so determined that her child should be a musician
that she played the violin every day during pregnancy. It must have worked,
since he later became one of the foremost theatrical composers of his day,
the equal of Ivor Novello and Noel Coward. And yet now, the last surviving
member of that generation, he is the English musical's forgotten man.
Novello is the mainstay of countless amateur operatic societies and Coward
of any company from Weston- super-Mare to the West End, but Ellis remains a
name for the record books and the library shelves. All of which should now
change as Dan Crawford, producer of the 1983 Mr Cinders revival, presents
Spread a Little Happiness, a compilation of 30 of his classic songs, at the
King's Head (reviewed in the FT yesterday by Alastair Macaulay).
Crawford believes such a setting to be the ideal showcase for his work.
'After Mr Cinders we spoke of doing other shows, but we always bumped into
the books.' These were of such colossal inadequacy that it is no surprise to
learn that, like other composers of the time, Ellis rarely read them but
simply provided a number for a specified slot.
But whatever the holes in the plots, the music that filled them lives on.
Sandy Wilson, whose The Boyfriend was a pastiche of just such 1920s
musicals, considers the tribute long overdue: 'I'm very glad they're doing
it. He's one of the eminent composers of my youth, whose tunes I grew up
with. When I was writing The Boyfriend I had Mr Cinders particularly in
mind.'
It was Mr Cinders, which played for 526 performances in 1929, that made his
name. But the road to the West End did not run smooth. - indeed, it first
looked to run to the Wigmore Hall rather than the Hippodrome, for his early
ambition was to be a concert pianist. But a classical career was thwarted by
both temperament and circumstance, although he is convinced that the
discipline has been crucial to his success: 'The difference between a
song-writer and a composer is that a song-writer is responsible for
individual songs, but a composer should have the ability to balance an
entire score. For that he needs a musical education like mine.'
Yet his first work, always excepting such childhood efforts as a lament for
the sinking of the Titanic, consisted entirely of incidental songs. He
placed one in a 1922 revue entitled The Curate's Egg. 'Arthur Wimperis, the
lyricist, encouraged me, saying money would roll in like a cascade. What
actually rolled in for the first year was Pounds 5. But from then on I was
hooked.'
He worked as a song-plugger for a music publishers by day, while hearing his
own sung in revue by night. His first chance to compose a complete score
came with Mr Cinders, even though he at once fell victim to the
transatlantic snobbery which has dogged him throughout his career. The
producer was anxious to attract a Broadway composer. 'American musicals had
swept the market. They didn't want anyone English and, except for Andrew
Lloyd Webber, they still don't'
But it is this very Englishness which lies at the heart of his music's
appeal. Sheridan Morley, the deviser of the present tribute, speaks of its
wistful, yearning guality. 'He is the master of songs of lost love . . . the
boy who could never get the girl. She was always too expensive, too foreign,
at the cinema or dancing with someone else. We've lost that, now that music
is so much more up-front.'
Mr Cinders brought him friends, fame and fortune, including the supreme
accolade: a contract from the legendary CB Cochran. The following season he
was responsible for the scores for six West End shows - a record Lloyd
Webber himself would find hard to beat. Such was his ubiquity that it was
wryly reported of a later Cochran revue: 'One novelty I discovered is that
Vivian Ellis will not compose the music.'
He continued to provide songs for individual performers. As Morley puts it:
'It is hard to find a great star of the Music Hall and theatre between the
1920s and the '30s for whom he didn't write.' For 15 years he was court
composer, often against his better judgment, to Jack Hulbert and Cicely
Courtneidge. 'He was a tyrant. Time and again I'd swear that I'd not do
another show; then Cis would take me to lunch at the Ivy and win me over
with her charm.'
Lavish lunches were fast becoming a fact of life, as he was taken up by high
society, under the aegis of the Baroness Catherine d'Erlanger. It was in her
Piccadilly mansion that he played his hit song The Wind in the Willows as a
piano duet with the Duke of Kent. 'He and the Prince of Wales used to ring
up the theatre to find out what time it was being performed so they could
pop in and hear it.'
With Frances Day, Maisie Gay, Jack Buchanan and Sophie Tucker singing the
songs, Rex Whistler and Cecil Beaton designing the sets, and Georges
Balanchine, Frederick Ashton and John Cranko choreographing the ballets, he
worked with some of the finest talents of his age. Among the many new
talents he discovered was his own: 'with one exception I found no one I
liked to write my lyrics; so I wrote them myself.'
The exception was AP Herbert, with whom he enjoyed a celebrated ten year
partnership at the end of the war. The war, and his six years' naval
service, had changed him: 'I became a very different composer, one of
operettas.' He had previously worked with Herbert on such classic revue
songs as Other Peoples' Babies so he was well-equipped to take on the score
of his political satire, Big Ben.
Although Gilbert and Sullivan, a partnership with which they have sometimes
been compared, had struck gold with the House of Lords, they themselves were
less lucky with their House of Commons satire. And yet it paved the way for
their later collaborations: Bless the Bride, Tough at the Top and The Water
Gypsies, which launched the young Dora Bryan. She remembers it 'with much
affection. It was the first time my name was ever in lights. It was too
old-fashioned for a lot of people, but it was lovely entertainment.'
The Water Gypsies was his last West End musical; although he has never
stopped working. 'When people want to know if I'm still writing, I tell them
that that's what the Queen asked; which always stumps them.' Now, at the age
of 87, he is an enthusiastic participant in the current show, unearthing new
material, such as Hengist and Horsa from a version of Lady Godiva, which
remained unproduced when the adaptor, Guy Bolton, failed to renew the
rights.
He is also actively involved in the Vivian Ellis award, an 80th birthday
present which, true to form, he shared with others. Modelled on the Gershwin
prize in America, it offers an annual showcase, at the Guildhall School, to
five or six young writers of musicals. And it is a measure of the respect in
which he is held that practitioners such as Cameron Mackintosh, Tim Rice and
Andrew Lloyd Webber regularly agree to judge.
Ellis's own advise to any budding composer is simply to listen: learn to
listen and listen to learn. Now a new generation has the rare opportunity to
listen to a master of the art.
