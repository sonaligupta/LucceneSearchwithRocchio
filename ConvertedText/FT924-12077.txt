FT  22 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Rhone-Poulenc in Dollars 100m deal to sell
chemicals unit


   By WILLIAM DAWKINS


RHONE-POULENC, France's largest chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, has
agreed in principle to sell a potash and chemical products unit for more
than Dollars 100m - the latest move in an ambitious asset disposals
programme.
The state-owned group has agreed to sell Alsace-based Potasse et Produits
Chimiques (PPC) to Ethyl Corporation, a US chemicals group.
This puts Rhone-Poulenc on track to achieve its target of FFr5bn (Dollars
980m) in asset disposals in the two years to the end of 1993, a strategy
aimed at reducing the debts it built up to finance US acquisitions.
It sold FFr1.5bn of non-strategic assets in the first half of this year and
is expected to have sold just over FFr3bn by the end of 1992, with the rest
to come in the following year.
Rhone-Poulenc owns 65 per cent of PPC, with the rest owned by Entreprise
Miniere et Chimique, another state-owned chemicals group, which will also
sell its stake.
