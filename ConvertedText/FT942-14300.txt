FT  21 APR 94 / Clinton under pressure on Haiti


   By JUREK MARTIN


   WASHINGTON


Pressure is growing on the Clinton administration to adopt more forceful
policies against the Haitian junta.
Late on Tuesday, five liberal senators proposed a bill, similar to one
already in the House, which would significantly tighten existing sanctions.
It would extend the current oil embargo to a complete ban on commerce, cut
off air links, and freeze the US assets of the junta and its civilian
backers, as well as denying them US visas.
Yesterday, Mr Randall Robinson, a respected political activist now in the
second week of a hunger strike, said he would not abandon his fast until the
'discriminatory, immoral and profoundly racist' US policy of summarily
returning Haitian refugees was dropped. The Senate bill would also deny
federal funding for operations repatriating Haitians.
The State Department was also forced to defend the purchasing by US
diplomats in Port-au-Prince of petrol illegally imported through the
Dominican Republic. This practice, according to Senator Christopher Dodd,
the Democrat from Connecticut and co-sponsor of the bill, rendered the oil
embargo a 'joke'.
The State Department said US embassy officials had no choice if they were to
tour the island, checking on human rights abuses and helping humanitarian
supplies get through.
