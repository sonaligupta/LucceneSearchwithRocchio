   HONG KONG


PEREGRINE Investments, the Hong Kong merchant banking and investment group,
yesterday launched a HKDollars 878.2m (USDollars 114m) offer for the shares
in Kwong Sang Hong International it does not already own, at HKDollars 2.65
each, Reuter reports from Hong Kong.
The offer, equivalent to Kwong's closing share price on Friday, triggered
the exercising of 2.13m Kwong Sang Hong 1994 warrants, raising Peregrine's
shareholding to about 35.09 per cent from 34.99 per cent previously.
The group is also offering 2.67 cents for each Kwong Sang Hong 1992 warrant
and 15 cents for each 1994 warrant.
This represents a discount of 86.4 per cent to 1992 warrants and 83.9 per
cent to 1994 warrants against their Friday closing prices of 19.6 cents and
93 cents, respectively.
Kwong Sang Hong, which has consolidated net tangible assets of HKDollars
1.68bn is engaged in property investment and development, investment
holding, manufacturing and sale of cosmetics and loan financing.
Paribas Asia has been appointed financial adviser to minority shareholders.
Kwong Sang Hong would retain its listing on the local stock exchange,
Peregrine said.
