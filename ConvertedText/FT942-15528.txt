FT  14 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Shortfall seen boosting coffee
prices


   By ALISON MAITLAND


A substantial shortfall in coffee supplies this year and a further deficit
next year will lead to greater than expected price rises, according to the
Economist Intelligence Unit.
The EIU has sharply raised its forecasts of price rises this year to 24.3
per cent for arabica and 23.6 per cent for robusta. In its February forecast
for world commodities, it predicted rises of just over 16 per cent for both.
Coffee futures prices continued their upward drive yesterday morning. The
London Commodity Exchange's second position robusta futures briefly broke
through the key psychological barrier of Dollars 1,500 a tonne but then ran
into selling and closed Dollars 7 down at Dollars 1,483.
The EIU says the worsening outlook for Brazil's harvest, starting this
month, explains the cut in its forecast of global supplies in 1994-95 to
72.5m bags (60kg each) from 75.4m two months ago.
It predicts a Brazilian crop of 20m bags, down from 24m in 1993-94, but says
a recovery is expected in 1995-96.
