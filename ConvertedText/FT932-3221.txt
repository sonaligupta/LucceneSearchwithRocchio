FT  15 JUN 93 / International Company News: Marriott to take provision


   By NIKKI TAIT


   NEW YORK


MARRIOTT Corporation, the US hotels and food services group, is to take a
Dollars 32m charge against its second-quarter earnings. The provision is to
reflect more accurately the net realisable value of assets being 'held for
sale', writes Nikki Tait in New York.
Marriott said the after-tax, non-cash charge followed discussions with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
