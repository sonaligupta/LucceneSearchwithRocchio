FT  20 MAY 92 / World Trade News: UK-led group in deal to run Romanian TV
station


   By VIRGINIA MARSH


   BUCHAREST


A UK-led consortium has won the right to operate one of Romania's two TV
channels, representatives of the group, led by Atlantic Television, said
after signing the deal yesterday, Virginia Marsh reports from Bucharest. The
new station, Channel 2 TV Romania, will be the first national commercial TV
channel in the former Soviet bloc.
Mr Robin Edwards, managing director of Atlantic Television, a
Canadian-registered company, and a non-executive director of Westcountry
Television of the UK, said the station would 'set the standard' for other
ex-Comecon countries.
The deal gives the new channel, a joint-venture company allocating a 20 per
cent stake to Radio Televiziunea of Romania, broadcasting rights for 15
years. Conceived as non-political, it will import half its programmes from
the west. Atlantic hopes it will be on air by the end of the year.
