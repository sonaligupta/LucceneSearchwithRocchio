FT  20 APR 94 / World Trade News: UK-S Korea in power agreement


   By MICHAEL SMITH


The nuclear power companies for South Korea and for England and Wales
yesterday sealed agreement for a significant exchange of information,
expertise and staff.
The agreement comes ahead of a virtual tripling by Korea of its nuclear
power capacity to about 20,000MW by the year 2006. Nuclear Electric, the UK
company which generates about a quarter of England and Wales's electricity,
hopes for a significant involvement in this expansion.
Its chances of significantly increasing its UK output are restricted by a
moratorium on nuclear power construction in the UK. Although it is pressing
to build Sizewell C, a nuclear station on the Suffolk coast, its ability to
do so depends on a forthcoming government review of the nuclear industry.
Nuclear Electric is already part of a consortium with Westinghouse hoping to
build a power station of the Sizewell C design in Taiwan.
