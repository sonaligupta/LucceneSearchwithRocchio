FT  13 APR 94 / International Company News: Daimler recovers after cost cuts

Daimler-Benz, Germany's largest industrial concern, is on the road to
recovery after a record DM1.8bn (Pounds 720m) net loss last year, according
to its chairman Mr Edzard Reuter.
Reporting an operating deficit of DM3.3bn after restructuring costs of
DM3.5bn, he said the turning point was reached in the last quarter of 1993.
The positive trend established then, with a DM442m operating profit, had
continued.
As the costs of restructuring  - including the loss of a further 18,000 jobs
this year  - had already been provided for, Mr Reuter confidently forecast a
positive operating result for 1994.
A satisfactory trend in overall group profits would be restored in 1995, he
said in the annual report published yesterday. By then, the company planned
to restore the loss-making Deutsche Aerospace and AEG Electrical engineering
subsidiaries at least to break-even. Meanwhile, Mercedes-Benz cars will
remain the main source of profits.
Group sales rose 23 per cent to DM13bn in the first two months of this year,
while turnover at the automotive division increased 32 per cent to DM9.5bn
 -some 73 per cent of the total.
Mr Reuter said car production would rise to 570,000 units this year from
480,000 in 1993. Sales were expected to increase to more than 570,000, from
508,000.
In Germany, where the overall market rose 1 per cent in the first quarter,
Mercedes registrations jumped 38 per cent. But the European operations of
the loss-making commercial vehicles business remained quite worrying, he
said.
Figures prepared according to the US accounting standards adopted after
Daimler's listing on the New York Stock Exchange showed Mercedes, which
absorbed DM1.7bn in restructuring costs, made an operating loss of DM1.3bn
last year. AEG and Deutsche Aerospace each lost almost DM1bn, while the
Debis Services arm improved from DM276m to DM366m at the operating level.
According to Mr Reuter, the group's recovery would stem from its new-found
strength after restructuring, not on what he called naive hopes of economic
recovery.
The unexpectedly sharp cut in the 1993 dividend from DM13 to D8, announced
last week, was a temporary setback, he added.
