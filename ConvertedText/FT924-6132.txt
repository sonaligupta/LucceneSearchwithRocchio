FT  23 NOV 92 / International Company News: Kepco to allow foreign
shareholders


   By JOHN BURTON


   SEOUL


KOREA Electric Power (Kepco), the largest capitalised company on the Seoul
bourse, yesterday lifted its ban on foreign shareholders.
Overseas investors will be able to acquire up to 8 per cent of Kepco shares
from tomorrow, with individual investors limited to a 1 per cent holding.
The shares have risen by 140 per cent since August in anticipation of
foreign investment.
The government, which owns 79 per cent of Kepco, decided three months ago to
open Korea's electricity monopoly to foreign investment in an attempt to
revive the flagging Seoul stock market. Kepco's size - it accounts for 12.5
per cent of Seoul's market capitalisation - and its sharp share price rise
has pulled up the rest of bourse.
The foreign investment ceiling of 8 per cent of Kepco represents 38 per cent
of the Kepco shares traded on the Seoul bourse.
The government sold 21 per cent of Kepco to the public through a share issue
in 1989. Kepco last year reported net earnings of Won719bn (Dollars 914m) on
sales of Won5,702bn.
