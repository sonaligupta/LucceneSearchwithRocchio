FT  12 APR 94 / More TV channels planned for Astra


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


SES, the Luxembourg company that owns the Astra television satellite system,
said yesterday in London that it planned to have 14 more television channels
on air by the end of this year.
The new channels will become available if the launch of the fourth Astra
satellite - scheduled for September or October this year - is successful.
This will bring the number of satellite channels available all over Europe
on the system to 64. Old receiving equipment is not, however, compatible and
will either need a new LNB (the horn part of the satellite dish) costing
about Pounds 40 plus fitting or a converter box which will cost about Pounds
30.
The main purpose of the fourth Astra satellite is to back up the first three
in case of malfunction but it also has spare channels.
The decision to go for 14 conventional satellite channels and only one or
two experimental digital channels reflects the high demand for conventional
channels and the fact that digital receiving equipment for consumers is not
yet on the market.
Two further Astra satellites, due for launch in 1995 and 1996, will be given
over mainly to digital rather than existing analogue television channels.
Television channels converted into digital form can be compressed allowing
up to 10 channels to be squeezed into the capacity previously needed for
one.
There is a trade-off between the number of channels and picture quality, but
by next year the first 150-channel systems could, in theory, be available
over Europe.
Eutelsat, Astra's main satellite television rival, will this week carry out
Europe's first demonstration of simultaneous high-performance analogue and
digital broadcasts from a single satellite transponder.
Until now each channel has needed a dedicated transponder.
