FT  20 MAY 92 / Judge orders arrest of Imelda Marcos


   By JOSE GALANG


   MANILA


THE ARREST of Mrs Imelda Marcos, the once-powerful widow of deposed
Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos, was ordered yesterday by a Manila
judge.
Judge Teresita Flores issued the order after Mrs Marcos failed to appear at
an arraignment in connection with charges of failing to report foreign
exchange deposits abroad.
Mrs Marcos had been accused by the government of having conspired with her
late husband in looting the economy while they were in power.
She had said she would defy the courts in protest against what she described
as 'systematic cheating' in May 11 voting when she ran as one of seven
presidential candidates.
