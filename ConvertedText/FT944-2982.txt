FT  15 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Current dividend trend has damaging
effects


   From Mr MARTIN SIMONS


Sir, The extraordinary rise in dividends declared by UK electricity
generators and distributors, coupled with buy-backs of shares 'which enhance
returns for shareholders' (Company News, This Week: 'Buy-backs set to
enhance returns for shareholders', December 12) is a national disgrace.
The necessary profits and cash flows for the distribution bonanza have been,
and continue to be, generated by duopoly suppliers using their muscle by
overcharging private and industrial customers. The latter suffer from
unnecessary cost pressure which inhibits investment and job creation.
The electricity industry continues to shed labour and past inefficiencies
are now used to justify electrifying pay increases for directors. When will
some influential spark realise that short-term electricity profit
optimisation is doing immense damage, especially to energy-intensive sectors
such as chemicals, glass, cement and heavy engineering?
Are French, German and Japanese electricity companies paying such high
dividends and buying back shares? No, because they have some sense, not
least for the common weal.
