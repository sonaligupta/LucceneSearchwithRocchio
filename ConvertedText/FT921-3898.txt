FT  12 MAR 92 / Hillsdown edges down after poultry and egg division slides


   By MAGGIE URRY


A HALVING of profits from its poultry and egg division caused a slight fall
in annual profits at Hillsdown Holdings, the food-processing group. Pre-tax
profits for 1991 were 2.3 per cent lower at Pounds 186.8m.
However, the result was slightly above expectations and a 10 per cent
increase in the dividend helped the shares to rise 3p to 172p in spite of
the weak stockmarket. The group's share price has been under a cloud since a
Pounds 280.7m rights issue at 210p flopped last autumn.
Fully diluted earnings per share fell 13.5 per cent to 21.1p compared with
24.4p adjusted for the rights issue.
Sir Harry Solomon, chairman, said that aside from poultry, where operating
profits fell from Pounds 59.4m to Pounds 26.3m, all the group's food
businesses 'met or exceeded our expectations in 1991'. He said 84 per cent
of operating profits now came from food.
Mr David Newton, group chief operating officer, said the company was working
on the integration of Hillsdown's poultry business and that of JP Wood,
acquired in February from Unigate for Pounds 36.7m.
Sir Harry said that the JP Wood deal was an example of the group's strategy
of using bolt-on acquisitions to strengthen the core businesses.
Meanwhile, Hillsdown was selling its peripheral activities, such as ice
cream and petfoods, in food, and it planned a flotation of Fairview, the
housebuilding subsidiary, when market conditions allowed.
The non-food activities, which include furniture, housebuilding and
property, had 'maintained profitability' in 1991 he said.
The results of Maple Leaf Foods, Hillsdown's 56 per cent owned Canadian
subsidiary, were also announced. Net earnings for 1991 were CDollars 67.2m,
(Pounds 32m) up from CDollars 41.1m. Maple Leaf said it was planning a joint
venture with ConAgra, the large US food group, in flour milling.
