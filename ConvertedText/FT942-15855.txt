FT  13 APR 94 / UK Company News: Erith


Erith, the building materials retailer, turned losses of Pounds 557,000 to
pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.09m in 1993.
Directors said the turnround was achieved against a background of continuing
subdued demand for building materials 'as the industry has struggled to
recover from the recession'.
Earnings per share were 1.74p, compared with losses of 0.82p, and the final
distribution is restored with 0.65p making a 1p total (0.35p).
