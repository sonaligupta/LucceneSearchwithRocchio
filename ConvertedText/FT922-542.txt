FT  26 JUN 92 / Money Markets: Overnight rate rises


HIGH shortages returned to the money markets yesterday and held throughout
the dealing session, prompting a squeeze in overnight rates.
Dealers said the shortage, initially forecast at about Pounds 1.4bn and
later adjusted down to around Pounds 1.25bn, held because a number of
clearing banks, which had already balanced their books for the half-year,
were unprepared to deal with the Bank of England and be forced to readjust
their accounts.
The shortfall was significantly higher than the previous day's figure of
Pounds 150m, and when dealing opened the Bank of England invited an early
round of bill offers.
However, the clearers were unwilling to enter the market and, at the first
round, the Bank was only able to buy bills worth a total of Pounds 145m. The
stand-off persisted and at the second round only Pounds 139m of bills were
exchanged.
Although there was some improvement in the afternoon, with the Bank buying
Pounds 423m of bills, it had to provide late assistance worth Pounds 415m at
the customary undeclared interest rate shortly before the close at 3.00pm.
This brought total help for the day to Pounds 1.132bn, compared with the
latest forecast of a Pounds 1.25bn liquidity shortage.
The pressure of the continuing shortage was particularly evident on
overnight money rates, pushed up to 13 per cent at one stage before easing
to close around 10 3/16 per cent. One-month rates ended steady at 10 1/8 per
cent and the key three-month rate closed firm at 10 1/16 per cent.
On short sterling futures, the September contract moved within a narrow
range to close marginally easier at 90.17 with just over 7,040 lots traded.
In Paris, the Bank of France left its intervention rate unchanged at 9.6 per
cent at a securities repurchase tender held yesterday to allocate funds for
injection into the money market today. It accepted bids for FFr11.5bn in new
liquidity, FFr18.5bn less than the FFr30bn leaving the market today when a
previous pact expires.
The intervention rate was last changed on December 23, when it was raised by
35 basis points. The central bank said it drained funds because it expects
bank liquidity to increase as a result of Treasury operations next week.
