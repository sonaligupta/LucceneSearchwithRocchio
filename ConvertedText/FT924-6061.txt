FT  24 NOV 92 / Ford workers to vote on strike


   By LISA WOOD


SHOP STEWARDS at Ford UK, market leader for new cars, voted yesterday to
ballot on strike action over job losses, Lisa Wood writes.
Officials voted unanimously to ballot the 25,000 hourly paid workers as soon
as possible on industrial action up to and including a strike. Union leaders
are recommending a Yes vote.
In September Ford said it wanted a reduction of 1,487 in the workforces of
its Halewood, Merseyside, and Dagenham, east London, plants. It wanted
voluntary cuts but said that if they had not been achieved by December 11
they would be compulsory.
Unions were offered an alternative: a six-month pay freeze and a cut in
lay-off payments. That was rejected.
