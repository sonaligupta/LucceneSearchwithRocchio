FT  11 APR 94 / UK Company News: Clydeport at Pounds 2.4m


Clydeport Holdings, operator of port facilities on the Clyde, returned

Hunterson traffic, turnover held up well at Pounds 11.8m.
Mr John Mather, chairman and chief executive, said the 'excellent start'
achieved by the company in its first year of operation had continued
throughout 1993.
