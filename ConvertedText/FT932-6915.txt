FT  26 MAY 93 / International Company News: Koreans rescue Curragh Resources

TWO Korean companies, Korea Zinc and Samsung, have come to the rescue of
Curragh Resources, the Canadian zinc producer which filed for bankruptcy
protection last month.
Curragh said yesterday that it would receive CDollars 50m (USDollars 39.3m)
of new equity from the two Korean groups, subject to the completion of a
financial restructuring and several other conditions.
The Korean groups will own about 50 per cent of the restructured company,
although this would be cut to 43.5 per cent after the exercise of options by
other shareholders. Curragh said it was pursuing efforts to raise another
CDollars 25m of new equity.
The involvement of the Koreans means that Curragh's big zinc mine at Faro in
the Yukon, which is mothballed, will re-open in September.
The company and the Yukon government would also be committed to completing
the nearby Grum mine. Yukon would be required to provide 'long-term
competitive power rates'.
Other zinc producers have criticised the Yukon government's backing for the
Faro and Grum mines at a time when the world zinc market is heavily
over-supplied.
Curragh suffered a CDollars 66m first-quarter loss, on net sales of CDollars
20.4m.
Besides being hit by low zinc prices, the company has been battered by the
repercussions of an explosion at its Westray coal mine in Nova Scotia last
year in which 26 people were killed. It took a CDollars 23.9m writedown on
the investment.
