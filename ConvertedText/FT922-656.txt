FT  26 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: CBOT moves closer to UK
recognition


   By TRACY CORRIGAN


THE Chicago Board of Trade moved a step closer to recognition as an overseas
investment exchange in the UK yesterday, when the Office of Fair Trading
published its report on the CBOT's application.
The CBOT, one of the three partners behind Globex, the screen-based futures
trading system launched yesterday, needs to be recognised before its
products can be traded on the Globex system in the UK. Its futures and
options on 10-year US Treasury notes can be traded on terminals in New York,
Chicago and Paris, but not London.
The report by the OFT concludes that none of the rules of the CBOT poses
significant competition issues in the futures and options market.
Under the Financial Services Act, the Treasury - which took over the role
from the Department of Trade and Industry on June 7 - has to seek the advice
from the OFT, prior to authorisation. The FSA also requires the Treasury to
take account of investor protection issues.
