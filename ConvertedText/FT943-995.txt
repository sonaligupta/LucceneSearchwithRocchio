   By MARK SUZMAN


   JOHANNESBURG


South Africa's inflation rate jumped to 9.4 per cent in August, well up on
the 8.2 per cent recorded in July and over 2 per cent higher than the 7.1
per cent reached in April, Mark Suzman reports from Johannesburg.
The figures are the latest in a series of worrying economic statistics for
the South African government, which said at the weekend that the trade
surplus had slumped to R288m (Pounds 51.6m) in August, down from R1.65bn in
July, and the lowest in nearly two years.
The South African Reserve Bank yesterday raised its key bank rate to 13 from
12 per cent.
