FT  22 APR 91 / International Company News: 3M shows first decline in
earnings since 1985


   By KAREN ZAGOR


THE IMPACT of recession in the US and slower growth abroad was reflected in
the first-quarter results of Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing (3M), the
diversified US manufacturer, which yesterday reported its first decline in
quarterly earnings since 1985.
For the three months ended March 31, 3M returned net income of Dollars 300m,
or Dollars 1.37 a share, against Dollars 335m or Dollars 1.51 the previous
year.
Mr Allen Jacobson, the chairman, said that although results should improve
in the second half, an increase in earnings this year was not certain. 'Much
will depend on the degree of economic recovery and the value of the US
dollar,' he added.
Looking ahead, 3M sees no sign of economic improvement and expects the
pressure on profits to continue in the second quarter.
A sharp downturn in 3M's Brazilian business reduced earnings by about 9
cents a share in the 1991 quarter. However, favourable currency translations
added about 13 cents a share to first-quarter earnings and a lower tax rate
added another 3 cents a share.
Wall Street had expected a weak quarter, but the results were somewhat
weaker than anticipated.
Mr Jacobson said profit margins were squeezed in the 1991 quarter by the
combination of lower product demand and strong price competition. During the
latest quarter, 3M had sales of Dollars 3.38bn compared with Dollars 3.16bn
a year earlier. Unit sales in the US rose 2 per cent, while overseas unit
volume grew about 5 per cent.
