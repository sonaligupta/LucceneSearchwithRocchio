FT  02 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bidders line up for Irish zinc
deposit


   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent


THE AUCTION for Europe's second-largest known zinc-lead deposit, at Lisheen,
County Tipperary in Ireland, is coming to the boil.
Two big mining groups, Minorco and Outokumpu, together with Ivernia West,
the small Irish exploration company which discovered the deposit, have
agreed to bid jointly for the 52.5 per cent of Lisheen put up for sale by
Chevron, the US oil concern.
Industry analysts suggest the stake, which has already attracted at least 50
potential purchasers, is likely to fetch between USDollars 50m and Dollars
80m but executives of the three bidding companies insist this is too high.
Ivernia owns the other 48 per cent of Lisheen and says it has the
pre-emptive right to match any bid by a third party. Minorco, the overseas
investment arm of the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa, and
Outokumpu, the state-owned Finnish group, are substantial shareholders in
Ivernia, with 16.9 per cent and 24.3 per cent of its equity respectively.
If their joint bid is successful, it will be funded by Minorco and
Outokumpu, which will each own 25 per cent of Lisheen with Ivernia having 50
per cent.
Ivernia recently revealed that reserves at Lisheen had been uprated to
18.38m tonnes containing 13.4 per cent zinc, 2.4 per cent lead and 38.7
grammes of silver a tonne, putting it second only in Europe to the nearby
Tara lead-zinc mine at Navan (wholly-owned by Outokumpu).
Exploration continues and Mr David Hough, Ivernia's managing director,
suggests the final ore reserve could be well over 20m tonnes. He says that,
if all goes well with planning applications and development work, a Lisheen
mine might start up in mid-1996.
'By the time we start production we will have spent USDollars 150m,' says Mr
Hough.
