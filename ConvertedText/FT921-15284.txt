FT  10 JAN 92 / International Company News: Rite Aid drops Revco plan


   By NIKKI TAIT


   NEW YORK


RITE AID, the US drug store chain, yesterday withdrew its reorganisation
plan for Revco, a rival retailer which is in currently in bankruptcy.
In a formal statement, Rite Aid said that it would not seek 'confirmation'
for the plan, which would essentially have involved Rite Aid in acquiring
Revco, at a bankruptcy court hearing next Monday. It claimed that bidding
levels had made the potential acquisition 'uneconomical'.
Rite Aid's decision follows an undecisive ballot among Revco creditors last
weekend over three competing reorgansiation plans - from Rite Aid, from
another retailer, Jack Eckerd, and a Revco-backed creditors plan. The last
of these proved most popular, gaining majority support from four of the
seven creditor groups. The Rite Aid and Eckerd plans were backed by two and
one classes respectively.
Earlier this week, Revco appeared hopeful that the weight of support behind
the creditor plan would encourage the bankruptcy court to force this scheme
on dissenting parties at the confirmation hearing, which was delayed from
January 8 to January 13.
