FT  13 APR 94 / Surveillance for Glasgow centre


Britain's biggest city-centre camera surveillance scheme will be operating
in Glasgow within six months. More than 30 streets in the city will be
scanned by 32 closed-circuit cameras under the Pounds 550,000 scheme,
part-funded by business, which follows the success of others in Birmingham
and Airdie, Lanarkshire.
Organisers claim that cutting crime and wooing visitors may increase city
centre business by up to Pounds 40m a year.
