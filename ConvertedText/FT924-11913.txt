   FRANKFURT


TALKS over the sale of a majority stake in BfG Bank, Germany's sixth biggest
bank, to Credit Lyonnais, one of France's biggest banks, have been adjourned
until next week after a day of 'constructive' negotiations in Frankfurt
yesterday, writes David Waller in Frankfurt.
A short statement from Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs (AMB), Germany's
second biggest insurance company and owner of a majority stake in BfG, said
last night that Mr Jean-Yves Haberer, chairman of Credit Lyonnais, would
meet again with Mr Wolfgang Kaske, AMB chief executive, next week, and with
Mr Hans Matthofer, head of the BGAG German trades union holding company
which is BfG's other shareholder.
