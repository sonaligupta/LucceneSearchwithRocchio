FT  13 APR 94 / International Company News: Winter Olympics boosts CBS


   By RICHARD TOMKINS


   NEW YORK


A strong boost from its highly successful coverage of the Winter Olympics
helped CBS, the US broadcasting group, report a 28 per cent increase in net
income to Dollars 69.3m from Dollars 54.2m in its first quarter.
The market had anticipated the results and the shares edged down Dollars 4
1/4 to Dollars 289 1/4 as investors took profits.
During the Olympics, the CBS Television Network had two weeks of the highest
ratings it has yet recorded.
Largely as a result of this event, net sales for the group surged by 42 per
cent to Dollars 1.25bn from the comparable quarter's Dollars 878.7m. CBS
said that if the effect of the Olympics was excluded, sales would have been
about 6 per cent ahead.
Earnings per share rose by 21 per cent to Dollars 4.23 from Dollars 3.50
last time.
The CBS Television Stations division was the biggest beneficiary of the
Olympics coverage, with sales and profits ahead very strongly. In addition,
CBS said, the improving economy had brought a substantial strengthening in
demand for local advertising.
Local and spot radio sales also benefited from more robust business
conditions, and CBS Radio reported better operating results led by improved
sales and earnings at the AM group of stations.
Mr Laurence Tisch, chairman and chief executive, said the group's operating
results continued to show steady improvement, reflecting the combined effect
of a strong programming schedule, strengthened demand for advertising and
active cost control.
