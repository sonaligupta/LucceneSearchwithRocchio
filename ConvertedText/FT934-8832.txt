FT  13 NOV 93 / Yorkshire colliery to be closed


FRICKLEY colliery near Pontefract, West Yorkshire, is to be closed, British
Coal confirmed yesterday, putting 740 miners out of work.
British Coal said up to 60 per cent of Frickley's output was being
stockpiled because there was no market for the coal. The situation was
unlikely to improve and production costs were among the highest of any
British Coal pit.
The NUM miners union will today urge members to reject the closure.
