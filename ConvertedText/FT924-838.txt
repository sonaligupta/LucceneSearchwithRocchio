FT  22 DEC 92 / Same election system for Britain


BRITAIN will retain the 'first past the post' system for the 1994 European
elections, Mr John Major has decided.
The prime minister said yesterday he would not imitate other European
Community countries, which all use some form of proportional representation
for electing members of the European parliament.
His comments ended speculation that the decision at the European summit in
Edinburgh to give Britain six more MEPs, bringing the total to 87, would
lead to electoral reform. Northern Ireland's three MEPs are already elected
by proportional representation.
Confusion remains over the allocation of the seats. The 1978 European
Parliamentary Elections Act did not provide for a review and any changes
would require legislation.
The prime minister said he could see the 'superficial equity' of making the
electoral systems used by EC countries conform.
But he added: 'Our tradition in this country is to maintain a direct
relationship between the elected member and an individual constituency and
that tends to argue for the 'first past the post' system. I don't myself
imagine that we are likely to change that.'
