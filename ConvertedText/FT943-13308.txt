FT  20 JUL 94 / Honda to spend Dollars 310m on boosting N American plants


   By JOHN GRIFFITHS


Honda, Japan's third largest carmaker, is to spend Dollars 310m (Pounds
198m) expanding its North American operations.
The investment will bolster its car and engine manufacturing capacity as
well as strengthening its research and development and sales facilities.
The move is the first significant step in a new strategy to give more
manufacturing autonomy to each of the four global regions into which it is
dividing its activities - the Americas, Europe/Middle East/Africa,
Asia/Australasia and Japan - and to lessen dependence on Japan as a
high-cost production base.
In another significant move, yet to be formally announced, it is planning to
tackle head-on the production cost difficulties it faces in Japan because of
the high value of the yen.
It plans to build a small car in Japan for supply to world markets. Expected
to be launched within the next three years, the small car - as yet unnamed -
is regarded by Honda as a test of the company's ability to drive costs down
inside Japan and keep its Japanese assembly plants world-competitive.
If Honda can do this with a small car, which is typically least profitable,
then adequate long-term profitability for its larger Japanese-produced
vehicles should be assured, according to senior executives.
However, Honda expected that it would have to source many of the components
for the small car in other Asia-Pacific states with emerging motor
industries and a lower cost base, Mr Nobuhiko Kawamoto, Honda's president,
said. No indication of likely production volumes has been given.
Some of the increased capacity is to be used to boost exports from North
America. These are already planned almost to double this year to 75,000 from
just over 43,000 in 1993. Under the expansion programme, they will double
again to at least 150,000 before the end of the decade.
The company said it would also produce 15,000 cars a year in Mexico,
starting next year.
Honda is to spend Dollars 60m increasing its North American vehicle-making
capacity by 110,000 units a year, to 720,000 units a year by 1997. Another
Dollars 200m is being invested in raising the capacity of its engine plant
at Anna, Ohio, from 500,000 units to 750,000 units a year. The remaining
funds are to be spent doubling capacity of its North American R&D
facilities.
The investments will create more than 1,100 jobs, 600 of them at Honda of
America's Ohio manufacturing plants and 250 at the new Mexico facility,
bringing Honda's total US employment to more than 17,000.
