FT  11 MAR 94 / Government Bonds: US Treasury prices ease in listless
trading

US Treasury prices eased across the maturity range in listless trading
yesterday morning, with traders attributing the declines to a higher gold
price and the dollar's weakness.
Just before midday, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 21/32 at
91 15/16 , yielding 6.887 per cent, and the two-year note was down  1/16 at
99 13/32 , yielding 4.927 per cent.
The lack of important economic statistics meant the market lacked a clear
direction from the opening. The day's only release of any significance - a
32,000 increase in weekly jobless claims - had no discernible impact on
prices.
Instead, dealers focused on a rise in the gold price and a decline in the
dollar against leading European currencies - both deemed bearish for bonds.
Otherwise, sentiment remained subdued, with investors reluctant to commit
funds to a market still vulnerable to sudden and sharp sell-offs.
