FT  29 APR 94 / Sweatshop pay rates anger Usdaw


   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff


An increasing number of businesses are taking advantage of the abolition of
wages councils to pay sweatshop labour rates, Usdaw, the shopworkers' union,
said yesterday.
A survey of 27 Jobcentres found wage rates for trainee hairdressers had
dropped to about Pounds 1 an hour.
One job for a trainee chef in Faversham, Kent, paid Pounds 35 for a 39-hour
week - 89p an hour. The people aged 16 and 17 at whom it was aimed were
expected to work split shifts and weekends.
A Cardiff store was seeking 'ambitious and motivated' shop assistants, with
three GCSEs, to earn Pounds 1.66 an hour for a 38-hour week.
Some of the poorest-paid jobs were in the retail sector. An adult assistant
at a butcher's in Bury, Lancashire, was offered Pounds 80 for a 40-hour
week.
Even jobs which expected high standards or unsocial hours offered wages at
much less than the minimum rates set by the former wages councils.
Two other features emerging from the survey were the absence of overtime
rates in low-paid sectors and the growth in jobs offering less than 16 hours
work a week, preventing low-paid workers claiming benefits.
'Many bosses seem to be taking full advantage of de-regulation to force down
hourly rates in some of the poorest-paid sectors of employment,' said Usdaw.
It feared that if cheaper rates became the norm they could force
better-paying employers to cut pay rates in order to compete.
