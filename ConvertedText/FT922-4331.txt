FT  05 JUN 92 / International Company News: Martinka pays Dollars 165m for
coal mine


   By ALAN FRIEDMAN


MARTINKA Coal, a US subsidiary of the UK-based Hanson group, said yesterday
it would pay around Dollars 165m to acquire a coal mine and reserves from
Southern Ohio Coal.
The purchase, which includes the assumption by Hanson of Dollars 26m of
liabilities, will see Hanson strengthening its US coal holdings through
Peabody Holding, a Hanson US subsidiary that controls Martinka Coal.
Hanson said that Dollars 62m would be paid when the deal closes in July,
while a further Dollars 77m would be paid out over the next 13 1/2 years.
The transaction also calls for Ohio Power, the electric utility that owns
Southern Ohio Coal, to agree a 20-year coal supply contract with Hanson's
Peabody subsidiary. Ohio Power is one of seven US utilities owned by
American Electric Power.
Peabody will provide Ohio Power with about 2.5m tonnes of coal annually for
a 20-year period.
The acquisition includes an underground coal mine, a coal preparation plant,
more than 60m tonnes of seam coal reserves and related equipment and
reserves.
