FT  05 MAR 94 / UK Company News: ML signs Icodextrin deal


   By DAVID WIGHTON


ML Laboratories has signed the long-awaited worldwide marketing deal for
Icodextrin, its glucose polymer solution for use in kidney dialysis, writes
David Wighton.
It is to form a joint venture with Fresenius of Germany, a world leader in
dialysis, which will have the exclusive rights to sell Icodextrin in all
markets apart from Japan.
Icodextrin is addressing the Pounds 500m a year market for solutions used in
continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, which cleans the blood of kidney
patients without the use of expensive dialysis machines.
Icodextrin will be launched in the UK in May and ML hopes to gain approval
in other European countries within the next few months.
