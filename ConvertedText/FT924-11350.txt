FT  27 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Green' law study planned


   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent


COOPERS & Lybrand, the accountancy firm, and the Metals & Minerals Research
Services consultancy organisation, have set up a joint venture to monitor
all aspects of environmental laws worldwide to assess the impact on copper,
lead and zinc production.
The venture springs from a comprehensive review by MMRS completed in July
this year which examined 700 pieces of legislation and came to the
unsettling conclusion that the three base metals industries would have to
find at least USDollars 6bn to comply with existing environmental laws.
Mr Normand Champigny, of Coopers' Toronto office, said his firm would use
its network of 700 offices in 112 countries to collect, collate and enter
into a database all environmental laws affecting base metals production. Mr
Simon Hobson of MMRS said his group would analyse these and forecast their
impact on metals producers and markets. The partners expect to release their
report in July next year and it will subsequently be updated quarterly.
