FT  11 NOV 92 / International Company News: CanPac to cut stake in US arm


   By ROBERT GIBBENS


CANADIAN Pacific is reducing its 45 per cent interest in United Dominion
Industries, a US-based engineered products affiliate, as part of its plan to
sell peripheral assets.
United, formerly Dominion Bridge, was a star performer for Canadian Pacific
in the late 1970s as it pursued a string of US acquisitions but the harsh
economic climate has forced it to reduce the size of its business.
The Canadian group is raising CDollars 105m (USDollars 83m) through an issue
of 8.5 per cent debentures convertible into United common shares by December
15 1995.
If all the debentures were exchanged Canadian Pacific's interest would fall
to 17.5 per cent from 45 per cent.
Each CDollars 1,000 principal debenture would be exchanged into 95.238
United shares.
