FT  12 APR 94 / Business and the Law: Backing for new insolvency procedure -
Legal Briefs


The Law Society has endorsed the introduction into English insolvency law of
a 'corporate voluntary arrangement' procedure, under which there would be a
moratorium on creditors' rights prior to a creditors' meeting to consider
the CVA proposals.
The small number of administrations and CVAs since the 1986 Insolvency Act
came into force is seen as evidence of the absence of a company rescue
culture in the UK. However, the Law Society's company and commercial law
committee warns that the number of successful rescues as a consequence of
CVAs is likely to be small.
Many companies became victims of the recent UK recession because of changes
in fundamental economic factors, for which existing rescue procedures
provide no relief, the committee says.
It suggests, therefore, a limit on the extent to which CVAs should take
precedence over existing insolvency procedures. The rights of
floating-charge holders, for instance, should not be altered radically
unless it is clear that any changes will not diminish companies' ability to
raise finance. The committee also wants checks imposed on directors during
the moratorium to prevent them from using the CVA to retain control of their
company for longer than is appropriate.
