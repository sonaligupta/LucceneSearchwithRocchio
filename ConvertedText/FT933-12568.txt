FT  23 JUL 93 / Technology: A helping hand for Japanese teachers - Worth
Watching


Teachers could soon be getting a helping hand from the latest technology. In
Japan NEC has used an expert system to cut the time it takes to work out the
school timetable.
The automatic school timetabling software combines an expert system
construction tool called Coastool with software that apportions the most
appropriate amount of time to each subject.
In trials at the Kukihokuyo High School in Japan's Saitama prefecture it
took seven working days to complete the 1992-93 timetable, compared with
manual scheduling, which takes 10 veteran teachers 10 working days (100 days
in all). NEC: Japan, 03 3789 6511; UK, 081 991 9697.
