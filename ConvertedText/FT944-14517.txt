FT  22 OCT 94 / UK Company News: GEC asked to clarify bid intentions


   By TIM BURT


The Takeover Panel indicated yesterday that it had approached GEC to clarify
whether the industrial group was considering a bid for British Aerospace or
VSEL, the submarine manufacturer which has agreed a takeover offer from BAe.
The move follows a report earlier this week that GEC was considering a
hostile bid for VSEL, but had virtually ruled out an offer for BAe, the
aircraft and defence equipment company.
While the panel admitted it was following up the report, it is unlikely to
force GEC to clarify its intentions.
The group, headed by Lord Weinstock, emerged as a possible predator for VSEL
soon after it received BAe's Pounds 478.5m agreed bid last week.
On Tuesday, BAe tried to head off a counter-bid by telling GEC it would be
prepared to resume talks on merging the two companies' defence interests if
it abandoned its interest in the Barrow-based shipbuilder. GEC was said to
be unimpressed by the offer.
Both groups are interested in VSEL because it would extend their interests
in shipbuilding, and would bring the Pounds 2.5bn contract for the next
generation of five Trafalgar class nuclear submarines.
