FT  20 APR 94 / International Company News: Perlis Plantations turns in 14%
climb


   By KIERAN COOKE


Perlis Plantations, the diversified Malaysia-based group controlled by
Malaysian Chinese businessman Mr Robert Kuok, has announced pre-tax profits
for the year ending December 31 1993 of MDollars 268m (USDollars 99m), a 14
per cent rise on the previous year's figure, writes Kieran Cooke.
Group turnover in 1993 rose 3.5 per cent to MDollars 3.45bn. Perlis has been
moving out of the plantations business and using much of its large land bank
for housing projects.
It is also developing a number of big leisure complexes in Malaysia.
Last year Perlis became involved in a multi-million dollar project to build
a power station in Malaysia under the country's independent power producer
programme.
However, the company withdrew from the project after certain unspecified
disagreements with the venture's partners.
