FT  06 JUN 92 / Cheese bid fails


DAIRY CREST, the Milk Marketing Board subsidiary, yesterday rejected a
Pounds 160,000 offer from the Hawes Dairy Rescue Committee for the
cheese-making creamery in the North Yorkshire town. Dairy Crest ceased
production of Wensleydale and other cheeses at the factory last week to
transfer production to Lancashire.
