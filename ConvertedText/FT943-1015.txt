FT  27 SEP 94 / Discount on Belgian Fords


   By KEVIN DONE


   LONDON


Ford, the US carmaker, is to offer cash incentives in Belgium - a discount
of BFr60,000 (Pounds 1,195) - to persuade owners of old cars to trade in
their vehicles for new Ford models. The French and Spanish governments
launched incentive schemes earlier this year to encourage owners of cars 10
years old or more to scrap their vehicles and replace them with new cars,
but Ford is one of the first carmakers to take an independent initiative.
The schemes launched by the French and Spanish governments in the spring
have had an immediate impact in boosting new car sales above last year's
depressed level, and the Spanish motor industry is campaigning to have the
six-month scheme extended beyond October.
