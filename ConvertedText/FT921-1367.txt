FT  24 MAR 92 / International Company News: DFC brings forward debt
repayments

DFC New Zealand, the former government-owned development bank which
collapsed owing more than NZDollars 2bn (USDollars 1.1bn) to international
banks in October 1989, believes it can repay all its creditors earlier than
expected.
It said yesterday it would repay the final NZDollars 235m to its tier-one
creditors, those with top priority for repayment, on April 15, three years
earlier than expected. This creditor group comprises several hundred mainly
overseas banks.
Mr Sandy Maier, the statutory manager, said creditors in tier two, who were
owed NZDollars 1bn, also 'have the potential to see earlier repayments.
There is nobody in front of them in the line now'. The tier-two creditors
were not scheduled to receive payments in their principal debt until 1997.
They were not expecting interest payments until 1995 at the earliest.
With tier-one debt out of the way, interest costs had been reduced, so that
money received from DFC's asset realisations could now be used to pay
interest on tier-two debt. The early repayment of tier-one debt meant that
NZDollars 1bn had been repaid in one year.
Mr Maier said DFC had sufficient assets to satisfy outstanding claims, even
on a worst-case basis. It was also pursuing ongoing litigation.
