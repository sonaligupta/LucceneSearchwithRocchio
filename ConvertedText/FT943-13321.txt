FT  20 JUL 94 / Observer: Snide fax


Not only did Didier Pineau-Valencienne, embattled head of the French
Schneider group, have to suffer the indignity of spending 11 days in a
Brussels jail after being placed under formal investigation by a Belgian
judge on charges relating to Belgian subsidiaries of the French engineering
group.
Now he's being asked to cough up no less than FFr2m to discover why he was
put in the slammer in the first place.
The sum has been requested by fax by a mysterious 'Van Krunkelsven', for
providing copies of the 2,400 page dossier allegedly compiled on
Pineau-Valencienne and Schneider by the Belgian judge supervising the case.
Schneider, who has no idea who Van Krunkelsven is, has neither responded nor
paid. Instead, it yesterday asked French prosecutors to open an
investigation - for attempted extortion - against person or persons unknown.
The fax, warning the company and Pineau-Valencienne that if they did not pay
up they would 'suffer the consequences', apparently derived from a
fax-for-hire shop in Brussels.
