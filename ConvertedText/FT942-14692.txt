FT  19 APR 94 / International Company News: Alcatel plan to buy into Stet
opposed

Alcatel Alsthom's ambitions to participate in the privatisation of Stet, the
Italian telecommunications group, were dealt a blow yesterday when Mr Romano
Prodi, chairman of IRI, the Italian state holding company, said he opposed a
significant role for the French group.
Mr Prodi, whose company has a 52 per cent shareholding in Stet, said he did
not see why Alcatel should be at the controls of Stet 'while we don't have
the same rights in France'.
Mr Prodi said he was also against mixing the manufacturers of
telecommunications equipment with service operators, and indicated his
opposition to privatising Stet through the formation of a group of core
shareholders.
Alcatel Alsthom has said that it wants to participate in the privatisation
of Stet through a partnership with Pirelli, the Italian tyres and cables
group.
Mr Pierre Suard, chairman of the French energy, telecoms and transport
group, said he was ready to participate in the privatisation of Stet,
linking industry groups, with Italian majority control. He said any
decisions needed to await clarification of the process for the
privatisation, expected by the end of the year.
