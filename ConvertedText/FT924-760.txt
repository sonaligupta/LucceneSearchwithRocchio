FT  22 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Parkland to sell Maitland UK


Parkland Textile, the Bradford-based woollen yarn, worsted cloth and
clothing manufacturer, is selling its UK garment manufacturing facility,
Maitland UK, to B Berwin for Pounds 1.26m, comprising a cash payment of
Pounds 132,000 and the assumption of borrowings amounting to Pounds 1.13m.
Despite recent reorganisation Maitland has continued to occur significant
losses - Pounds 642,000 before interest and tax in the year ended February
28 1992. All employees are to be offered employment by Berwin on terms 'no
less favourable' than those currently enjoyed.
Maitland's principal activities are the manufacture of own label men's
suits, jackets and trousers for retailers.
The sale needs shareholder approval.
