FT  15 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading


   By JOEL KIBAZO


The recovery in both US and European bonds, together with renewed hopes of a
reduction in interest rates, helped the derivatives sector to a steadier
performance, writes Joel Kibazo.
In its last full week of trading ahead of Friday's expiry, the Liffe March
contract on the FT-SE 100 opened at 3,203, in line with the opening on the
underlying cash market. Buyers encouraged by the recovery in US bonds at the
end of last week helped the contract advance in early trading.
The release of encouraging February producer price data, once again led to
hopes of a reduction in interest rates, encouraging increased buying of
March as it climbed to its peak of 3,238 in the afternoon.
Following a bout of profit-taking March finished at 3,233, up 62 on its
previous close and at parity with the cash market. Volume at the official
close stood at 16,756 lots.
The Liffe FT-SE mid-250 March contract closed at 3,895 after business of 175
lots, while the same contract on the OMLX finished at 3,888.2 after trading
235 contracts.
In traded options, volume on Liffe fell to 32,435 lots with 18,471 dealt in
the FT-SE 100 option. British Airways, the busiest stock option, saw 1,889
lots dealt.
