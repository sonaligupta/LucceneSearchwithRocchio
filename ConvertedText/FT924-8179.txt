The Essential History Of Europe (8.00 BBC2) promises to provide unusual
insights into each of the 12 member states of the EC, starting with Denmark.
With scenes shot at a birthday party, a night voyage to Sweden, a Viking
fantasia, and a furniture design company, this opening programme tries to
establish why the Danes were the first to vote against Maastricht.
BBC1's new wildlife series Living Dangerously (8.00) offers unusual points
of view: the world and all its human activity seen from the animal's
eye-line. It begins with a Bengal tiger in Nepal, an animal which many
greenies would like to see thriving and increasing. However, producer
Richard Brock points out that those who live in the area regularly come face
to face with the tigers on their doorsteps.
BBC2 starts the heavily promoted comedy series Absolutely Fabulous (9.00).
It is written by Jennifer Saunders, who also stars as a fashion PR, with
Joanna Lumley playing the fashion director of a glossy magazine.
We Have Ways Of Making You Think (9.30 BBC2) is the first in a series of
three programmes about propaganda and the mass media.
