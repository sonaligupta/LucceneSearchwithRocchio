FT  02 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Shell's Pounds 1bn Indian venture to go
ahead

   NEW DELHI


SHELL, the Anglo-Dutch oil group, and Arvind Mafatlal, the Indian chemicals
and textile group, have decided to go ahead with a Rs60bn (Pounds 1bn)
petrochemical project that potentially marks the largest foreign investment
in India.
The decision to embark on the design and engineering phase of a more than
threefold expansion of their National Organic Chemical Industries Limited
(Nocil) ethylene plant in west India comes after a detailed reappraisal of
the venture. This followed an almost doubling of costs on a project first
proposed six years ago as a result of inflation and the devaluation of the
rupee.
The government's liberalisation policies had also added to uncertainties on
future cash flow because of the prospective drop in India's protective
tariffs.
Nocil said yesterday that the third reappraisal of the project had shown it
to be 'sufficiently robust' for the partners to proceed to an 18-month
design and engineering phase.
Construction would begin after that - though Nocil might earlier place
advance equipment orders.
