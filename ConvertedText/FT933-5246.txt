FT  04 SEP 93 / Patten in partial retreat on truancy


   By JOHN AUTHERS


MR JOHN PATTEN, the education secretary, yesterday withdrew plans to publish
school-by-school league tables of truancy rates in primary schools.
He provoked opposition from teachers' unions by confirming, however, that
truancy league tables for secondary schools will be published in November.
Data at primary school level will be made available for each local education
authority.
The secondary-school tables will show the percentage of pupils missing one
or more sessions - a morning or an afternoon - without authorisation, while
tables comparing local education authorities will include figures on the
percentage of pupils absent at least once without permission, and the total
number of sessions missed. All state and independent schools that accept day
pupils must submit the information to the Department for Education.
Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head
Teachers, said: 'What the government now needs to do is to apply the logic
of this decision in the primary sector to secondary schools and thereby
complete the U-turn it has half performed.'
