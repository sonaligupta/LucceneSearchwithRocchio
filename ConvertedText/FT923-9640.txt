FT  04 AUG 92 / Agency has surplus of Pounds 1.56m: Companies House freezes
fees


   By ANDREW JACK


COMPANIES HOUSE, the government's company information agency which is
subject to a review that may lead to privatisation, reported a surplus of
Pounds 1.56m in the year to March 31, compared with a deficit of Pounds
6.59m in the previous 12 months.
The annual report and accounts, which have been prepared along the lines of
a private company for the first time, left the agency with a retained
surplus of Pounds 421,000 after paying a dividend of Pounds 800,000 to the
Treasury to reflect past investment.
Fees and charges rose from Pounds 20.17m to Pounds 32.35m last year, while
expenditure rose from Pounds 26.63m to Pounds 30.95m. The agency says there
will be no increase in fees during the current year, and that it will be
launching two new computerised services: a register of corporate mortgages
and one of directors and secretaries.
It has cancelled its ambitious image-based search system, on which it has
spent more than a Pounds 1m. This would have allowed documents to be stored
and read electronically, but it says the system is not financially viable in
the current economic climate. Against the four performance objectives
announced by the minister of corporate affairs in May 1991, it reports that:
80.5 per cent of British companies' accounts and annual returns were filed
on time by mid June, compared with a target of 85 per cent.
93 per cent of documents were made available to the public within the
planned five days after their receipt from companies. The average document
processing time is 5.8 working days.
Unit costs were reduced by 2 per cent, compared with a target of 1 per cent.
99.8 per cent of company searches for customers were achieved within the
planned two hours. The hope is to reduce the time to one hour by April 1994.
Companies House, which is an executive agency under the government's Next
Steps initiative, was granted trading agency status last October, giving it
considerably greater flexibility and responsibility than other parts of the
Civil Service.
The accounts show assets of Pounds 24.06m, including Pounds 2.68m in
intangible assets which reflects capitalised development expenditure.
The contribution paid to the Department of Trade and Industry for company
regulation and the development of company law fell to Pounds 17m from Pounds
18.7m the year before.
The salary of the chief executive for the last six months of the year is
Pounds 26,000, including pension contributions.
