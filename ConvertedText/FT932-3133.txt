FT  16 JUN 93 / Pessimism over latest ceasefire

THE military commanders of the three warring communities in Bosnia yesterday
agreed on a ceasefire, to take effect today, as fighting intensified
throughout the republic.
Previous agreements, however, have collapsed almost immediately and there
was little optimism that the latest one would last.
Even as the three military chiefs met at Butmir airport in Sarajevo, fresh
clashes were reported on most battle fronts in the country.
Sarajevo radio said at least eight people were killed in Gorazde, a besieged
United Nations-designated 'safe area' in south-eastern Bosnia. Serb forces
have been on the offensive for three weeks near the town, which is the last
Moslem stronghold in the region.
Bosnian Serb forces are reportedly poised to seize Gorazde, flagrantly
violating its UN status.
Meanwhile, the UN was yesterday forced to suspend its humanitarian airlift
to Sarajevo after gunfire erupted close to incoming aircraft, officials
said. But they added that flights could be resumed today.
