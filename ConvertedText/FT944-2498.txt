FT  16 DEC 94 / Ukraine abandons bond issue


   By MATTHEW KAMINSKI


   KIEV


President Leonid Kuchma yesterday abandoned Ukraine's Dollars 10bn (Pounds
6bn) bond issue. The scheme, launched this spring by former President Leonid
Kravchuk, had been criticised over the legality of selling bonds backed by
Ukraine's industrial and natural resources. One MP also alleged the bonds
were sold in the UK and Switzerland, with the revenue diverted to secret
bank accounts. Mr Kuchma's decree dissolves the Ukrainian Credit Fund, which
oversaw the sale of 400 bonds worth Dollars 25m each, and orders prosecutors
to look into the corruption allegations. He also promised that 'all
obligations' to holders would be met. The episode casts yet another shadow
over Mr Kravchuk's last year in office. His prime minister during the last
nine months, Mr Yefim Zvyahilsky, was indicted in November on embezzlement
charges.
