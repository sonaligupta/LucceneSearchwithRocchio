FT  28 APR 94 / UK Company News: DFS 'bang on target' with jump to Pounds
9.99m


   By MAGGIE URRY


DFS Furniture, the specialist upholstery retailer, yesterday reported maiden
interim pre-tax profits 47 per cent higher at Pounds 9.99m, a figure 'bang
on target' according to Mr Graham Kirkham, chairman.
The group floated last November at 260p; the shares closed yesterday at
299p, down 1p.
Mr Kirkham said that with the third quarter almost complete and taking eight
week lead times in the business into account, he was confident of predicting
'a successful outcome to the year'.
During the half year to January 31, sales rose 28 per cent to Pounds 66.6m,
with the 23 comparable upholstery stores producing sales gains of 8.7 per
cent, reflecting increased volumes and no price increases. Two stores were
opened in the half year; the group also operates three dining furniture
shops.
Operating profits rose 15 per cent to Pounds 11m (Pounds 9.55m), with
margins down from 18.4 to 16.5 per cent. However, Mr Chris Ferris, finance
director, said margins had been distorted by extra promotional spending and
store openings and compared to 16.3 per cent for the whole of 1992-93. At
the time of the float DFS said operating margins for the current year would
be similar to last year's.
Pre-tax profits were affected by non-recurring items, including the Pounds
1.49m cost of the float in the latest period and the Pounds 4.14m package
paid to Mr Kirkham prior to the float in the comparable figures, which was
partially offset by a Pounds 840,000 property profit.
Interest receivable was Pounds 482,000 (Pounds 554,000). Mr Ferris said net
cash at the half year end was Pounds 16.5m, which gave the group the
flexibility to take up opportunities. The group recently paid Pounds 2m for
a freehold site for a store in Birmingham. Capital spending for the year is
forecast at Pounds 6.5m (Pounds 4.1m).
Excluding the non-recurring items, earnings per share rose 11.2 per cent to
7.44p. The interim dividend is set at 2.3p (notional 2.1p) and Mr Kirkham
stressed the aim was for dividends to show real growth. The notional full
year dividend last year was 6.4p.
