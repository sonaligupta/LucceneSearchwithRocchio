FT  28 APR 94 / Japan moves on digital TV plan

Japan's Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications aims to standardise digital
television technology for satellite, terrestrial and cable broadcasting by
1996, the ministry said.
The plan, the first concrete indication of its firm intention to move
towards digital broadcasting, is based on a report by an advisory panel,
made public yesterday, which recommends the early development of digital
broadcasting technology in line with international trends.
The report, which will form the basis of policy at the ministry, points to
the enormous progress in the west towards digitalisation of broadcasting and
calls for the Japanese to speed up their move to digital television.
'The standardisation of ATV (next generation TV) broadcasting in the US and
satellite digital TV broadcasting in Europe is expected to progress strongly
in the next year or two, while international standardisation through the ITU
(International Telecommunications Union) is also planned in the future,' the
report notes.
The publication of the report comes just months after an official caused
uproar by indicating that the ministry was keen to promote digital
television, even at the expense of Japan's home-grown high definition
system, known as Hi-Vision, which is an analogue system.
The electronics industry at the time protested vigorously against the
ministry's expressed stance on the grounds that Hi-Vision was a technology
which the ministry itself has promoted avidly and on which the industry, as
well as Japan's public broadcaster NHK, has spent vast R&D funds.
However, the advisory panel's final recommendations put Japan firmly on the
digital route.
The country already is seen to be behind in the technology race against the
US and Europe, which have significantly more advanced plans for introducing
satellite digital TV than Japan does.
