The French National Assembly voted unanimously last night to proceed with an
investigation of the losses at the state bank Credit Lyonnais. The bank
reported a loss of FFr6.9bn (Pounds 800m) in 1993 and will get a state
bailout and a capital injection. A 12-member National Assembly commission,
headed by Assembly President Philippe Seguin, will examine the bank's
financial problems and the effectiveness of the banking system's
surveillance mechanism. Economics Minister Edmond Alphandery told parliament
the inquest was 'probably the only way to calm the doubts that may have
arisen about the quality of banking surveillance in France'.
