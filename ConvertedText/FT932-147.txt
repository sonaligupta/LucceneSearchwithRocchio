Alzheimer's is a particularly loathsome disease because it turns sufferers
into different people. We are, to a large extent, our memories whether in
the complex sense of carrying our family history with us or at the simplest
level of remembering how to make a cup of tea. Alzheimer's destroys both
capacities and turns mothers and fathers, husbands and wives into fey
strangers. Some victims shout and wander around, others, like my late
father, sit and smile quietly, not knowing who you are or what you are
doing. Black Daisies For The Bride is BBC2's 'ScreenPlay' production written
as a prelude to National Alzheimer's Awareness Week by poet Tony Harrison.
Filmed in High Royds Hospital in Yorkshire, it combines documentary, drama,
music and verse (9.00). The Late Show follows up with a studio discussion
(11.15).
It is bad enough that BBC2 and Channel 4 run their wildlife repeats against
one another, worse that they ensure the subjects clash. Last week both
covered beetles, this week it is snakes. C4 offers Rattler and BBC2 adders
in Summer Wildlife (8.30).
