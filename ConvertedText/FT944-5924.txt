FT  01 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Sleaze and the new universities


   From Ms CHRISTINE CHEESMAN


Sir, Your article on 'sleaze' in higher education institutions ('Sleaze goes
to university after government reforms', November 29) highlights the
weaknesses of the 1988 Education Reform Act. The incidents which you quote
are, however, only a small proportion of those which have been brought to
our attention by academics employed in the higher education corporations.
Whereas the 'old' universities are governed by bodies on which there is
balanced and broad representation of both academic staff and the local
community, there is only minimum staff involvement in the governance of the
new universities and even that involvement is very strictly curtailed in the
finance and personnel areas.
Moreover, when problems occur in the 'old' universities, especially when
they concern senior staff, appeal my be made to the Visitor, who can usually
prevent a problem escalating into a scandal or cause celebre.
The model of a company without shareholders is not appropriate for the
management of academic institutions. The traditional university model was
developed over many years and produced a system where there was a level of
confidence, and yet the powers of their Visitor were then weakened by the
1992 Further and Higher Education Act. However, the generally held
confidence in the management in the traditional universities is sadly
lacking in many, if not most, 'new' universities.
The government should now realise that the Education Reform Acts are
seriously flawed and amend them, lest there be yet more incidents such as
those you mention.
