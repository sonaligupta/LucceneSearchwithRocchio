FT  30 JUN 93 / EC move on works councils faces veto


   By DAVID OWEN


THE GOVERNMENT will use Britain's veto to block EC plans to introduce
mandatory works councils in large trans-European companies, Mr David Hunt,
employment secretary, told MPs yesterday.
He said in his first parliamentary question time that such bodies would
'greatly damage' Europe's competitiveness. Britain wanted no return to
legislated co-operation between companies and workers.
Statutory works councils would mean 'going back to the bad old days of the
1960s and 1970s', he said. He called for all EC proposals to be tested on
the effect they had on Europe's competitiveness.
Britain insisted last month that plans for the councils should be taken off
the agenda for a meeting of labour and social affairs ministers, and hopes
its veto threat will head off any intention to press ahead with the
proposals during the Belgian presidency, starting in July.
Britain can block the directive under present EC procedures but once
Maastricht has been ratified and the social protocol takes effect, other
countries can introduce it.
Even though the UK has opted out of the social chapter British companies
could still be affected by the plans, as many have operations in continental
Europe large enough to require them to introduce the new procedures there.
