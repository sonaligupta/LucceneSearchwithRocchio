FT  29 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Most funding in place for
Nigerian LNG project

The second stage of funding for the Nigerian liquefied natural gas company
is now in place.
The government and its foreign partners, Shell, Elf and Agip, recently
increased the total shareholders' capital in two escrow accounts to about
Dollars 1bn, most of the equity that it expects to need for the project,
which has an estimated total cost of between Dollars 4.5bn and Dollars 5bn.
About 40 per cent will be equity and the rest from loans.
Schroders merchant bank is helping the company to raise finance from export
credit agencies and other official lenders while the International Finance
Corporation will lead the commercial bank funding.
'A lot of people were sceptical about Nigeria raising the cash but it has
paid 60 per cent of the cash so far,' says Mr Theo Oerlemans, the new
managing director.
Subject to funding, the final investment decision is due early next year,
once the contract for construction has been awarded to one of two
consortiums led by Bechtel and Kellogg, both using the American APCI
process.
NLNG plans to start shipping 5.6m tonnes a year from two LNG trains by early
1999 to its four end-users, of which two thirds will go to Italy's Enel and
the rest to Enagas of Spain, Gaz de France and Distrigas in the US.
The company was re-launched last December when the state-owned Nigerian
National Petroleum Corporation agreed to reduce its 60 per cent stake to 49
per cent and Shell in effect took control. When the shareholding has been
restructured in the coming months, Shell will own 24 per cent, Elf 15 per
cent, Agip 10 per cent and the International Finance Corporation is
committed to take 2 per cent.
