FT  03 AUG 92 / Economics: Little joy in US indicators


   By EMMA TUCKER


THERE is unlikely to be much joy for President Bush in this week's string of
US economic indicators. The decision to cancel his holiday and stay in
Washington could look like a good idea as further mediocre news on the
economy emerges.
July employment figures, out on Friday, are unlikely to show any significant
improvement from their depressing condition in June, when non-farm payrolls
fell a shock 117,000. Non-farm pay-rolls should have risen a modest 109,000,
while the unemployment rate should show barely any change from June's 7.8
per cent.
Economists are expecting this week's data to add to the general impression
that the US economy continues to grow in the third quarter, but only
sluggishly, at an annual rate of between 1.5 to 2 per cent.
Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said recently that
economic 'momentum' was going to take off in the second half of the year,
but worries about the resilience of the US economy are likely to continue
especially as the election draws nearer, and political uncertainty starts to
worry the markets.
Today's report from the National Association of Purchasing Managers is
expected to point to only a slightly more upbeat assessment of the outlook
among US manufacturers.
The following include some of the other economic events this week. The
figures in brackets, from MMS International, are the median of economists'
forecasts.
Today: US, July National Association of Purchasing Managers index (54 per
cent), June construction spending (up 0.2 per cent); UK, July purchasing
managers index; Japan, July foreign exchange reserves.

official reserves (-Dollars 100m).
