FT  12 MAR 93 / PowerGen grants pay deal of up to 5%


   By DAVID GOODHART


ONE of the most generous awards of the current pay round has been granted at
PowerGen, the electricity generator, where the 5,500 workers will receive
annual rises ranging from 4 per cent to 5 per cent - well above the
inflation rate of 1.7 per cent, David Goodhart writes.
This contrasts with far less generous deals at some regional electricity
companies in England and Wales. At Eastern Electricity, pay has been frozen
and the working week raised from 37 hours to 40 hours. At National Power,
PowerGen's larger rival, workers received 3.9 per cent over 15 months from
October but also agreed to accept a performance pay system next year.
The PowerGen deal, the first since the introduction of 'single-table'
bargaining with the unions for all the main groups of workers, provides a
2.5 per cent increase on basic rates with additional lump-sum payments
ranging from Pounds 250 to Pounds 550. Mr Jim Mowatt, chief union
negotiator, said the deal would be recommended by the unions.
The government, which has set a limit on increases in public-sector pay
bills of 1.5 per cent, still owns 40 per cent of PowerGen.
