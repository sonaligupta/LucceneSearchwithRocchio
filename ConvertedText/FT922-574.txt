FT  26 JUN 92 / Observer: Cell out


Interested in prison visiting? Keen to travel to exotic places? Then the
foreign office consular service may be for you.
One of the prime tasks of its officials, says today's report from the
National Audit Office, is giving solace to the 2,300 British citizens in
foreign gaols. Indeed, all consular staff now receive training in
prison-visiting before moving to Havana or wheresoever.
Assiduous as ever in assessing the effectiveness of government expenditure,
the audit office spoke to 20 Brits imprisoned abroad to find out whether
they were satisfied with the quality of consular services. Most appeared
happy with the assistance received, though whether this included the
provision of files in cakes is not disclosed.
