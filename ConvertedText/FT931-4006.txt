FT  12 MAR 93 / International Company News: Cathay ahead 1.9% in slow market

RISING costs and a sluggish world civil aviation market held Cathay Pacific,
the Hong Kong airline controlled by Swire Pacific, to 1.9 per cent growth in
1992 profits to HKDollars 3bn (USDollars 389m) from HKDollars 2.95bn the
year before.
Mr Peter Sutch, chairman, warned that he did not expect to see much, if any,
growth in 1993.
Cathay reinforced this view by maintaining its dividend at the 1991 level
with a final payout of 31.5 cents, making 42 cents for the year.
The profits were struck on an 11.5 per cent increase in turnover to
HKDollars 23.3bn from HKDollars 20.9bn. The higher sales were, however,
absorbed by inflation and lower yields on passenger and cargo traffic.
Mr Sutch said: 'Just because we are in Asia does not mean that we are
insulated from what is happening in the industry worldwide.'
He noted that from the fourth quarter of last year and into the first
quarter of this year demand for aviation services in Japan and continental
Europe, especially Germany, was soft. This was a more important factor than
the revenues lost as a result of a strike late in January this year.
However, Mr Sutch said that in 1991 the airline had embarked on a programme
to reduce costs. Unit costs in 1992 were held at 1991 levels, 'which shows
we have made some progress given the 10 per cent inflation we have in Hong
Kong.'
The airline sought a 15 per cent reduction in costs over the three years
1992-1994, he said. It had transferred its accounts division to neighbouring
Guangzhou in China, established a computer site in Sydney, and, on a
voluntary basis, was stationing flight crews in other parts of the region.
He expected to be able to cut aircraft maintenance costs when the airline's
subsidiary, Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Company, had relocated some
facilities to southern China.
During 1992 Cathay's passenger load factor remained at 73.5 per cent, but
its yield per passenger kilometre fell by 1.6 per cent. Its yield on cargo
fell by 5.5 per cent. Capacity, however, rose by 15 per cent.
Yields are expected to remain under pressure this year, with the volume of
passenger traffic not expected to grow appreciably and the pressure on fares
likely to be downward.
Operating margins fell 1 percentage point to 13 per cent, well below the
18.5 per cent recorded in 1988. Mr Sutch said the efforts to reduce costs
were designed to reverse this trend.
