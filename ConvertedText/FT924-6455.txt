FT  20 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Alliance winding up order abandoned


   By PEGGY HOLLINGER


GIROZENTRALE Gilbert Eliott has abandoned its attempt to wind up a former
client, Alliance Resources, the Louisiana-based oil and gas company which it
brought to the market in 1991.
The broker has reached an agreement with Alliance over its claim for Pounds
38,346 in flotation fees. Cash-strapped Alliance had already paid Pounds
71,635 in fees but disputed the outstanding amount.
Alliance, which remains in receivership, also announced a series of board
changes, which resulted in the reinstatement of former chairman Mr John
O'Brien and the appointment of two new non-executive directors, Mr Marcus
Black and Mr John Craven. Mr Don Bealer, former vice-chairman, has resigned.
The group was put into receivership last month by the unquoted Manx
Petroleum, where Mr O'Brien is managing director.
Manx claimed that Alliance had defaulted on the terms of a management
agreement and a Dollars 200,000 (Pounds 132,000) loan following the surprise
dismissal of Mr O'Brien.
