FT  16 JUN 93 / Governor calls for greater freedom


   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor


MR ROBIN Leigh-Pemberton, the outgoing governor of the Bank of England, last
night called on politicians, academics and the City to consider how the Bank
might be given more independence while staying accountable to parliament.
In cautiously worded remarks, he suggested that thought should be given to
devising a 'form of accountability that might enable us to have the
advantages of a more autonomous central bank within the constitutional
arrangements of our parliamentary democracy'.
In what was his valedictory speech to the City before stepping down after 10
years as Bank governor at the end of this month, Mr Leigh-Pemberton said he
recognised 'along with the prime minister, that any change to the current
status of the Bank of England could pose a dilemma in the UK with our long
tradition of parliamentary accountability on the floor of the House by a
minister of the crown'.
He added: 'I think all of us - politicians, academics, ourselves in the City
 -will need to consider how this dilemma might be reconciled.'
In his remarks last night he was taking up comments made by Mr John Major
last week in the Commons in which the prime minister indicated he might be
in favour of central bank independence 'were a way to be found to get the
benefits . . . without the loss of parliamentary accountability'.
However, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, made clear in his speech that he
did not intend to rush into a debate about giving more autonomy to the Bank.
