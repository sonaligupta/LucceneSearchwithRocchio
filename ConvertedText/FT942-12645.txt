Orenstein and Koppel, the German construction equipment maker, plans to
raise DM144m (Dollars 85m) with a rights issue and expects a 'modest overall
profit' this year.
The company reported a 1993 loss of DM65m, compared with a DM116m loss the
year before.
Krupp Hoesch, the steel and engineering group which owns 75 per cent of O&K,
is to take up any new capital not subscribed by minority shareholders. The
company said its shares would resume trading today in Frankfurt, following a
one-day suspension.
No dividend will be paid this year and the company is not expected to have
sufficient funds for a dividend in 1995.
Mr Manfred Link, chief executive, has ordered a 30 per cent pay cut for
members of the management board and a 15 per cent cut for senior executives.
Mr Link hopes this will save the group DM16m.
O&K lost DM3m on ordinary activities last year, but has set aside a further
DM60m to finance ongoing redundancies.
The company said a further 750 jobs would be lost this year, leaving the
company with about 4,550 employees by the end of 1994.
Redundancy costs were high because the workers being made redundant had been
with the company on average for 14 years, it said.
