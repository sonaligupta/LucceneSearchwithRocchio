FT  18 APR 94 / Company News (This Week): Retailers braced for effects of
tax rises - Other Companies


This month's income tax increases are expected to dominate the results of
the raft of small retailers - such as Etam, Bentalls, Austin Reed, Tie Rack
and Liberty - which are reporting next week.
However, it may still be a bit too early to get any meaningful indications
from the current trading statements. Most company observers will be waiting
for Sears' results on April 26.
Retailers are more likely to comment on what was generally perceived to be a
weak Easter.
Etam, the fashion clothing company, will be the most closely examined of
those reporting. It is expected to show a 33 per cent pre-tax profits
advance to about Pounds 14.5m, excluding property losses.
Evidence appears to indicate that the group has been struggling to draw in
new customers, but the hard core Etam shopper remains loyal. The total
dividend may well be raised by 7 per cent to 7.4p.
