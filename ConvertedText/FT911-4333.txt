FT  19 APR 91 / Investor claims


INVESTORS in Robert Carter & Partners, a West Midlands-based investment
manager, may claim as much as Pounds 3.5m from the Investors Compensation
Scheme (ICS).
About 180 Carter investors are thought to have claims on the scheme, which
announced yesterday that it had declared the firm to be in default under its
rules.
The ICS also announced that it had declared the London-based share dealer,
Alexander Securities, to be in default.
About 600 Alexander investors are though to have claims on the scheme as a
result, with as much as Pounds 500,000 at stake.
Both firms were registered with Fimbra, the investor protection
organisation. The scheme, since its formation in 1988, has paid Pounds 5m to
about 1,000 investors and declared 20 firms to be in default. Under the
terms of the scheme investors can claim up to Pounds 48,000.
