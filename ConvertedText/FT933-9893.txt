FT  06 AUG 93 / Foreign Exchanges: French franc falls again


THE French franc, Belgian franc and Danish krone were somewhat softer
against the D-Mark yesterday in spite of the policy of all three countries
to keep their overnight interest rates at very high levels, writes James
Blitz.
The French franc was trading at around FFr3.4625 against the D-Mark at the
start of European trading. But the franc soon fell back to a low of
FFr3.4775 after the Bank of France effectively revealed that its foreign
exchange reserves had been severely depleted by intervention in support of
the franc in recent weeks.
Economists have calculated that the Bank of France's official net reserves
fell by some FFr100.5bn in the week to July 29, using figures issued by the
central bank yesterday.
Some analysts said this would have left the Bank of France with only
FFr12.5bn going into Friday July 30, when there was massive intervention to
support the franc.
That depletion of reserves would partly explain why the Bank of France
allowed the franc to fall through the critical FFr3.4180 level that it had
been defending that morning. But it also suggests that the country may have
a negative net reserves position, since the figures do not take into account
swaps and forward selling of the franc.
The franc closed in London last night at FFr3.469 to the D-Mark from a
previous FFr3.466. This was in spite of an overnight cost of borrowing of
around 12 per cent.
The Danish krone weakened despite its one-month interest rates staying at 25
per cent. It finished at about DKr3.9498 to the D-Mark, having been at
DKr3.9225 at the start of the day. The Belgian franc fell outside its former
ERM band against the D-Mark, ending at BFr21.11, just below its old ERM
floor of BFr21.09.
The Spanish peseta also fell back yesterday, receiving little support from
the government's new plans to rein in the country's budget deficit. Mr Pedro
Solbes, the Spanish finance minister, announced that current spending plans
next year will be frozen and that spending on social items will rise by 6
per cent, maintaining its relative weight in GDP.
The weakness of the D-Mark due to this high interest rate policy in Europe
continued to give some upside to the dollar, which closed at DM1.7165 from a
previous DM1.7105. But the US currency finished New York trading at
DM1.7116.
The dollar was partly supported by better than expected jobless claims
figures, which showed a decline in US first time jobless claims to 336,000
in the week to July 31 after a revised 396,000 in the prior week. US June
factory orders also improved. They were up 2.6 per cent, the first gain in
four months.
However, sterling eased against the D-Mark yesterday amid some speculation
that the UK would cut base rates later in the year. The pound ended at
DM2.5600, down from Wed-nesday's DM2.5675 close.
