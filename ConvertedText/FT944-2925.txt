FT  15 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Queens Moat replies


Queens Moat Houses yesterday denied it had been granted soft banking terms
to enable it to continue trading.
The reply from Mr Andrew Coppel, chief executive, was in response to
comments by Sir Paul Nicholson, chairman of Vaux, who on Tuesday said:
'Certain companies, which ran into financial difficulties, have been kept
afloat with subsidies from their bankers enabling them to gain a competitive
advantage over properly financed companies.'
Mr Coppel said he 'totally disagreed' with the comments but refused to make
any further statement for fear of 'adding credibility to (the accusations)'.
Queens Moat is expected to announce terms of its financial restructuring
before the December 21 AGM .
