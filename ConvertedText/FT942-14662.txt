FT  19 APR 94 / International Company News: Combined net losses at Randgold
group increase

The four gold producers in the troubled Randgold stable had another
disappointing quarter as expected productivity gains failed to materialise
and the group had to make provisions for claims after an accident at its
Harmony mine. The mines' combined after-tax loss increased to R21.52m
(Dollars 5.9m) compared with R17.29m in the December quarter.
Mr John Turner, chief executive, said overall yields had remained lower than
expected. Combined with long-standing forward sales contracts at gold prices
significantly below spot, this prevented the group from taking full
advantage of the improved gold price.
Overall ore milled increased slightly to 2.26m tonnes from 2.23m tonnes last
quarter, but gold output dipped further to 8,758kg from 8,941kg.
At East Rand Proprietary Mines, expected productivity improvements resulting
from the introduction of a seven-day week proved unattainable and the scheme
had to be scrapped as a result of excessive fatigue on the part of
mineworkers. Nonetheless, ERPM was the group's only mine to stay in the
black, with after-tax profits of R3.19m following a loss of R16.87m in the
previous quarter.
At Harmony, the group's biggest mine, an improved after-tax profit of
R9.67m, compared with R8.97m, was transformed into a R18.3m loss after R28m
had to be put aside to cover expected costs for the clean-up after the
collapse of a slimes dam.
Further provisions are possible as third-party claims are made, but the
company believes it has adequate insurance to cover these.
Durban Roodepoort Deep improved slightly, turning in an after-tax loss of
R1.56m compared with R6.82m, but Mr Turner said new capital expenditure and
development was 'absolutely essential' for survival and that the mine would
request further state aid.
Blyvooruitzicht reported an after-tax loss of R2.67m compared with R2.55m,
reflecting a continued decline in yield to 5.66 grammes/tonne from 6.19
grammes/tonne.
