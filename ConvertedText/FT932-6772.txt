FT  27 MAY 93 / Wales in drive for tourism jobs


THE Wales Tourist Board yesterday launched a strategy to create 10,000
tourism jobs by the end of the decade.
Tourism 2000 emphasises attracting overseas visitors to the countryside and
includes projects to regenerate coastal resorts and historic towns.
The Welsh tourist industry employs about 95,000 people - 9 per cent of the
workforce - and brings more than Pounds 1.25bn a year into the economy. The
new strategy envisages earnings rising to Pounds 2.2bn at current prices by
the year 2000.
