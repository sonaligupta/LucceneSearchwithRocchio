FT  17 JAN 92 / International Company News: Uni-Storebrand in NKr1bn charge

UNI STOREBRAND, Norway's largest insurance group, will suffer large share
portfolio losses and take other non-related charges against 1991 accounts
totalling more than NKr1bn (Dollars 156m).
The company said that by the end of 1991 its share portfolio had run up
losses of NKr940m following negative developments on the Oslo bourse in the
third quarter.
Uni Storebrand also said a NKr150m charge is to be made against 1991
accounts to cover losses on motor underwriting.
In 1990, Uni Storebrand made a net profit of NKr403m and suffered a loss on
its share portfolio of NKr373m. Last autumn, the group paid NKr4.2bn to
acquire a 25 per cent stake in Skandia, Sweden's biggest insurer.
The company stressed that a large part of its share portfolio losses are due
to its position as a leading shareholder in loss-making Den norske Bank
(DnB) and Christiania Bank, Norway's two biggest banks.
They were rescued from insolvency last autumn by the state which injected
NKr11.5bn into the banking system.
'These shareholdings reduced investment income in 1991 by around NKr230m in
the group's non-life company and by NKr320m in the life assurance company,'
Uni Storebrand explained.
Christiania Bank, Norway's second biggest bank, was taken over by the state
last October, after which the bank was forced to write down its shares to
zero.
Uni Storebrand held 3m shares in Christiania Bank and 2.5m in DnB, which
holdings have since been slightly reduced.
