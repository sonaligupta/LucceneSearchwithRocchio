FT  06 JAN 94 / Cities battle for England's Commonwealth Games bid


   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent


The final heats in the competition to be the English city that bids to stage
the Commonwealth Games of 2002 began yesterday when Manchester published the
bid it hopes will defeat rivals London and Sheffield.
The Commonwealth Games Council for England will choose between the three on
February 2. The winner will have until November next year to persuade the
federation of similar councils throughout the Commonwealth to award the
games to England.
New Delhi, Nairobi, Cape Town and a Caribbean city are all likely contenders
for 2002, but the 50th anniversary of the Queen's accession is seen as a
powerful selling point by all three English hopefuls.
The London bid is led by the private sector but stems from London First,
part of the government's experimental city pride partnership scheme to
stimulate regeneration. The Wembley stadium and arena complex are expected
to figure.
Sheffield's bid relies on the stadium, swimming pool and arena built for the
World Student Games of 1991.
Manchester is bidding with almost the same team that failed to win the 2000
Olympics. It will have Europe's biggest arena and a covered cycling stadium
ready next year.
