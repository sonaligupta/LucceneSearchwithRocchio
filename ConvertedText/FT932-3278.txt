FT  15 JUN 93 / A behemoth goes to the block: Haig Simonian and Robert
Graham examine the privatisation of Italy's largest state holding company


   By HAIG SIMONIAN and ROBERT GRAHAM


IRI, Italy's biggest state holding company, looks increasingly like a
beached whale - an ungainly creature that cannot be refloated. The political
waters in which it has moved for four decades are evaporating. The country's
politicians are distracted by scandal and, even if there was a will to keep
IRI alive, its finances are so parlous it is unlikely to survive in its
present form.
Group losses for last year were L4,809bn (Pounds 2.13bn), while accumulated
debts are L73,000bn, equal to almost 5 per cent of Italy's gross domestic
product. Privatisation of the empire, which employs 400,000 and has
interests ranging from baking to banking, telephones to television, is seen
by company strategists as the only way forward.
The impetus for change has been accelerated by the arrest last month of Mr
Franco Nobili, IRI's chairman since 1990 and the manager under whom debts
and losses mushroomed. His arrest, on corruption charges, provided the
government with an opportunity to bring in someone who would not shy away
from the basic question: does IRI need to exist in the 1990s?
The man chosen for the job is Mr Romano Prodi, the distinguished economist
who chaired IRI from 1982-89 until replaced by Mr Nobili. His previous
involvement in IRI may not seem the best qualification, since several
problems date from that period. But Mr Prodi's supporters, including Prime
Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, claim he is returning to push through the
rationalisation he was prevented from implementing by the politicians.
Power has been concentrated in the hands of Mr Prodi following the transfer
of Mr Michele Tedeschi, former chief executive, to IRI's telecommunications
subsidiary. He had been virtually running the group since last August, when
it was converted into a joint stock company.
A senior IRI official said: 'There is an urgent need to raise funds, and
privatisation will probably be along the lines Tedeschi has already worked
on.'
The main fear inside IRI's impressive 1930s head office in Rome is that the
financial urgency behind IRI's sell-off will mean that broader questions of
industrial development could be ignored in the reorganisation. IRI managers
insist the state still has a role, especially in sectors such as advanced
technology. They say IRI could be made slim and dynamic by selling scores of
companies and remaining as an investment vehicle with minority participation
in its engineering group Finmeccanica, and Stet, the telecommunications
holding company.
Yet this strategy could consign IRI to the same fate as that of Efim,
Italy's third-largest state industrial holding company, which became a
dustbin of unwanted businesses. Efim was wound up last July with debts of
more than L15,000bn, and the creditors' problems have yet to be resolved.
IRI could be left to nurse the loss-making companies which it could not
offload and which would be impossible to close for social or political
reasons.
The group's biggest loss-makers are Ilva, Europe's fourth-biggest steel
producer, and Iritecna, its construction arm. Between them, they account for
the bulk of IRI's 1992 losses. At Fincantieri (shipbuilding), Finmare
(shipping) and Alitalia (the airline), losses have been staunched, but all
remain in the red; while the finances of RAI, the television and radio
umbrella organisation, are severely stretched. IRI also owns two of Italy's
biggest banks. Although their profits are falling, they remain among the
group's biggest earners.
With domestic interest rates still high and the economy in recession, the
company is struggling to generate enough cash to meet daily needs, let alone
investments. IRI's financial difficulties were exacerbated by the
progressive withdrawal of funding since 1987 from the government, which was
striving to contain the large budget deficit.
More recently, support from the banks has declined because of concern about
IRI's financial health. Some foreign bankers, chastened by the debacle over
Efim, have cut lending, fearing a repetition. To make matters worse, an
Italian law prohibiting companies from issuing bonds when their debts exceed
their total capital, as in IRI's case, has removed recourse to the bond
market.
In the light of these constraints, piecemeal privatisation has become an
imperative, and has won the backing of the new government. The former Amato
government set the sell-off ball rolling last year, but there were internal
disagreements over an 'industrial strategy' for the state sector, with some
politicians fearing the loss of patronage implied by privatisation.
The Amato government had begun whittling away such patronage. IRI's board
was slimmed down to three members, while big subsidiaries, such as
Finmeccanica, gained in importance by obtaining an individual stock market
listing. The Ciampi government, with a more homgoneous economic team, is
less susceptible to pressure to keep IRI alive, particularly since the
country's political landscape has been transformed by the corruption
scandals, and the politicians who tried to stall the privatisation process
are discredited.
Despite the recession, which has limited the market for big sales, and the
wariness of some foreign multinationals to make Italian purchases, IRI is
slowly going on the block. The first sale will be SME, IRI's food
production, retailing and catering operation. Preliminary offers for two of
SME's food production divisions have been received and a deal is likely
within the next month. Together, the two operations should raise about
L1,200bn. The sale will be followed by that of SME's remaining food
retailing and catering activities, valued at about L2,000bn.
The other attractive assets up for sale are the two banks. IRI aims to sell
all or part of its 67 per cent holding in Credito Italiano, the
sixth-largest Italian bank, which is quoted on the stock market. Plans to
sell Banca Commerciale Italiano are less advanced.
Rather than floating its Credito shares on the market, IRI has opted for a
sale to another bank or a pool of institutions, in the hope of a higher
price. The most recent indications are, however, that no bank will pay the
L6,000bn estimated value. IRI has been forced to explore the possibility of
splitting its stake between several financial institutions and, as a result,
the deal is taking longer than expected.
While the banks deals are proceeding slowly, the financial pressures on IRI
are growing more urgent. Its Ilva steel arm has reported a L2,309bn loss for
last year and expects to lose about L1,700bn this year. Plans to restructure
it via asset sales and debt transfers to IRI have been critically received
by the European Commission, which supervises Europe's steel industry, and
the chances of a quick privatisation look slim.
Iritecna's financial difficulties are almost as pressing. A company will be
created, as with Ilva, to run the most profitable activities, while
loss-making subsidiaries and a large slice of debt will be transferred to
IRI pending restructuring or disposal.
With the timetable for sales lengthening, IRI has turned to sophisticated
money-raising techniques to pay its bills. So far, it has raised about
L1,000bn by selling future dividends on some of its profitable operations.
It has also sold tax credits on the shares of some subsidiaries. Although
such practices are commonplace in Italy, they have triggered a public row.
Critics charge IRI with using financial gimmicks to delay privatisation.
'They're pulling out all the stops to raise short-term cash wherever they
can, rather than just selling assets,' said one observer.
Mr Pietro Ciucci, IRI's finance director, points to last year's disposals of
controlling interests in the Cementir cement group and Banco di Roma as
proof that the company is not reluctant to sell. Like several other IRI
executives, he claims some of Italy's leading businessmen are waging a war
of words against the group because they are waiting to pick up bargains.
'Each time we devise an operation to help IRI survive, they get angry,' he
says.
Mr Ciucci and his colleagues stress the company is committed to disposals,
but not at the price of undervaluing its assets. The argument assumes IRI
has the luxury to choose the best moment for its sales. With the clock
ticking fast and losses mounting, time is not on its side.
