FT  21 JUL 94 / Union seeks shareholder revolt over directors' pay


   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff


The biggest union at British Steel is organising a shareholder revolt among
its members against large boardroom salary increases, including an Pounds
109,000 bonus paid to Mr Brian Moffat, the company chairman.
The Iron and Steel Trades Confederation is asking members to register their
concern by voting against the re-appointment of Sir Nicholas Goodison. He is
the only one of six non-executive directors seeking re-election at the
annual general meeting next week who agreed the pay rises for executive
directors.
Mr Moffat received a 20 per cent increase in his base salary in 1993-94
which rose from Pounds 321,630 to Pounds 386,960. The additional performance
bonus took his total annual pay to almost Pounds 500,000.
At the same time the basic pay of British Steel employees, said the union,
had risen by between 2 per cent and 3 per cent, or between Pounds 6 and
Pounds 9 a week.
Mr Keith Brookman, union general secretary, accused British Steel directors
of having 'the national disease afflicting British boardrooms  - pure
financial greed'. He added that the rises were 'galling and distasteful'.
Between 21,000 and 22,000 union members have shares in the company but this
still only represents about 5 per cent of the total shareholding. ISTC
claims to be the first union to have organised such a gesture.
British Steel said that directors' bonuses were linked to profits unlike
other employees. Mr Moffat's increase in basic pay reflected the fact that
he was now doing two jobs - chairman and chief executive.
