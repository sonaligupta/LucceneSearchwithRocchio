FT  29 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Partridge attributes setback to Gulf war


A marked reduction in visitors from the US in the aftermath of the Gulf war
hit profits at Partridge Fine Arts, the New Bond Street-based antique
furniture and objets d'art dealer.
American business reduced sharply over the 12 months to end-October and was
'not yet showing signs of fully returning to previous levels', said Mr John
Partridge, chairman.
Nevertheless, overall business improved during the second half with prices
of furniture proving particularly strong.
Pre-tax profits dived 47 per cent to Pounds 2.16m (Pounds 4.11m) on turnover
down some 27 per cent to Pounds 9.64m (Pounds 13.2m). Earnings per share
declined to 6.54p (11.77p); the final dividend is cut to 1.25p (1.85p),
reducing the total from 3.85p to 2.25p.
