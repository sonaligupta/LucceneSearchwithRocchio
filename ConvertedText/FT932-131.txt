FT  30 JUN 93 / Observer: Not so magic Circle


Mark Boleat - busy bee chief executive of the Building Societies Association
and about to depart for an even bigger job at the Association of British
Insurers - has earned a black mark on his otherwise unblemished report card.
He may be jolly good at putting big ideas across but recent problems at one
of the outfits under his command raise the question of whether he is
over-stretching himself by taking on too many worthy outside jobs.
The question is prompted by the recent difficulties at Circle 33, one of
Britain's biggest housing associations, which provides over 8,000 homes for
low income families in the south-east. Boleat has been associated with
Circle 33 for 15 years and has been chairman since 1990. A combination of a
police investigation into allegations of a long-running fraud and concerns
about internal monitoring procedures led to the Housing Corporation, the
official regulator and lender of last resort, temporarily suspending its
funding to Circle 33 earlier this month.
This is almost as bad as the Bank of England suspending a bank's licence and
precipitated the departure of Circle 33's director, Melinda Phillips. The
funding has been restored but the episode is embarrassing for Boleat since
he was also on the board of the Housing Corporation.
He's now stepped down to devote more time to sorting out Circle 33 but has
signalled that he will resign the Circle 33 chairmanship after the annual
meeting in September.
His problems have highlighted a dilemma facing an increasing number of busy
executives who give up their time for worthy causes. Can they spare enough
hours to keep a proper eye on a complex organisation? The days when housing
associations like Circle 33, which spend around Pounds 75m a year, can be
overseen by unpaid volunteers must be numbered.
