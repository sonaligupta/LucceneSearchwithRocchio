FT  24 NOV 92 / Letter: New role for chambers of commerce


   From Mr D P ROBERTS


Sir, Last week you carried two letters concerning Chambers of Commerce.
Gisela Davis's (November 16) is well argued describing the virtues of
chambers as they exist on the continent with public law status. Brian Wright
(November 19) was less sure about their effectiveness in providing advice to
small firms.
A more worrying article appeared on November 16 which described how Training
and Enterprise Councils are developing membership schemes which compete
directly with chambers of commerce and undercut chambers' subscription
('Tecs move 'undercuts chambers''). This is the worst of all worlds and it
is amazing that this wholly devisive development should be allowed to
continue.
To avoid emasculation of chamber membership there is a possible solution
which could offer a way forward and help to re-establish the industrial
wealth-creating culture which we have spent a long time walking away from.
The government should introduce compulsory registration of all businesses to
be administered by chambers of commerce. The registration would be free and
the cost of administrating the scheme would be borne from either a
subvention from the local authority budget or as part of the enterprise and
business development budget of Tecs.
The membership so created would be enfranchised and would be the basis of
legitimising the directors of chambers of commerce and Training and
Enterprise councils. The chambers of commerce would become an effective
focused local centre of business opinion and leadership. They would
predominantly comprise small and medium-sized enterprises from where
Britain's future prosperity will be derived.
