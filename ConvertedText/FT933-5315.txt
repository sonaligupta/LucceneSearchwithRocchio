FT  03 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Healthcare issues rise as Dow
declines again

Wall Street
IN SPITE of heavy demand for health-related issues, blue chips mainly
weakened in subdued trading yesterday as more investors deserted the equity
markets ahead of the long US holiday weekend, writes Patrick Harverson in
New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 19 points at
3,626.10. The Standard & Poor's 500 finished 1.85 easier at 461.30.
Secondary stocks fared better, with the American SE composite gaining 2.31
at 461.28 and the Nasdaq composite adding 2.50 at 748.65, both record highs.
Trading volume on the New York SE was 259.9m shares.
Once again, the markets struggled to find a clear direction, in spite of
another big gain in bond prices. Normally, rising bond prices (which sent
long yields down to new record lows) would provide sustenance for stocks;
but so many market participants were on holiday ahead of the Labor Day
weekend that the bond rally had little impact.
Economic news also left traders and investors unmoved: jobless claims fell
7,000 in the final full week of August, while factory orders were down a
larger than expected 2.1 per cent in July. Little attention was paid to the
data because the market was speculating instead on what might be revealed in
today's August employment report. Wall Street economists are forecasting
that non-farm payrolls rose about 150,000 last month.
In afternoon trading, sell programs, concentrated mostly in blue chips, hit
the market.
The brightest feature of the day was the drug and healthcare sector, which
rose sharply on a newspaper report that President Bill Clinton had abandoned
his plan to impose mandatory price controls on drug companies and health
service providers as part of his reform of health care.
Among leading issues, Merck advanced Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 33 1/8 ,
Pfizer Dollars 2 to Dollars 64 3/4 , Bristol Myers-Squibb Dollars  7/8 to
Dollars 57, Schering-Plough Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 63 and Glaxo Dollars
5/8 to Dollars 18 7/8 . In the healthcare group, United HealthCare forged
ahead Dollars 3 to Dollars 62 1/8 and US Healthcare, traded on the Nasdaq
market, rose Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 47 1/8 .
The gains in drug issues were offset by declines in cyclicals. Aluminum
Company of America fell Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 73, Minnesota Mining &
Manufacturing Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 107 7/8 , Caterpillar Dollars 1 1/4 to
Dollars 80 3/4 and International Paper Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 62 3/4 .
Canada
TORONTO slipped moderately from its record high as gold shares weighed down
the overall market.
The TSE 300 index ended 6.6 off at 4,137.1 and declines led rises by 375 to
367. Volume rose to 60.3m shares valued at CDollars 709.7m. The golds index
dropped 2.9 per cent as the New York bullion price fell USDollars 6.50 an
ounce to USDollars 363.75.
