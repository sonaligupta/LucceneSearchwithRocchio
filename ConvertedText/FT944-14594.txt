FT  21 OCT 94 / International Company News: Leif Hoegh lowers forecast

Leif Hoegh, the Norwegian shipowner, reported a sharp fall in nine-month
pre-tax profit, to NKr136m (Dollars 20.8m) from NKr581m, and cut its
forecast for 1994 net profits by NKr50m to NKr200m.
It blamed the weaker result on reduced capacity and lower earnings by car
carriers and liner vessels; high operating costs; lost time due to
dry-docking; unrealised losses in the bond portfolio; and bigger than
anticipated losses by its Cool Carriers unit.
Group freight revenue rose to NKr2.14bn from NKr1.79bn, but higher voyage
and charter-hire costs cut operating profit, before depreciation, to NKr248m
from NKr463m.
Leif Hoegh said this year's figures were not directly comparable to last
year's, as Bona Shipholding, spun off earlier this year into a separate
company, is not included.
In addition, Cool Carriers, which the company recently acquired from
Bilspedition in Sweden, and Arcade Shipping, the Norwegian group which
acquired this summer, are consolidated in this year's accounts.
Net financial charges against accounts reached NKr24m compared with NKr12m
last year. Hoegh attributed this to higher interest rates which reduced the
value of its bond portfolio.
It said unrealised gains on shares and bonds, of NKr11m, had been reversed,
and that a further loss of NKr19m was charged against accounts.
Color Line, one of Norway's biggest ferry operators, yesterday reported a
near doubling of nine-month pre-tax profits, to NKr205m from NKr118m. It
said the full-year result would provide a satisfactory return on invested
capital for the first time since the company was established four years ago.
Group revenue rose slightly to NKr1.61bn from NKr1.38bn, held back by a
NKr130m increase in operating costs to NKr1.14bn. Operating profit shot up
by NKr100m to NKr466m, helped by a 12 per cent rise in passenger volume.
Following last month's Estonia Baltic Sea ferry disaster, new reservations
have been well down on normal levels for the period.
'Should this reticence in reservations continue for the rest of the year, I
would estimate a weakening in the result for the year for Color Line in the
region of NKr15m compared with our original expectations for 1994,' said Jon
Erik Nygaard, managing director.
