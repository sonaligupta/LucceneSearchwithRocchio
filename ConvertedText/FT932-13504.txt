FT  23 APR 93 / Sweden acts to curb budget deficit

SWEDEN'S centre-right minority government yesterday announced further deep
spending cuts and new measures to tackle unemployment, warning that the
short-term outlook for the economy was worse than previously forecast.
It also warned in its supplementary budget proposal that the budget deficit,
among the highest in western Europe, would be SKr191.2bn (Pounds 16.6bn) for
the financial year starting July 1. This is 12.9 per cent of gross national
product and nearly SKr30bn more than indicated three months ago when the
government made its initial budget proposals.
The spending cuts announced yesterday are in line with indications given in
the broad outline of the budget in January.
Government forecasts now point to a 1.7 per cent fall in GNP this year,
compared with the 1.4 per cent drop predicted in January. Next year, it
predicts growth of 1.2 per cent, compared with its earlier 1.6 per cent
forecast. The government said the main reason for the adjustment was the
sharp slowdown in the German economy.
The forecasts came as the Swedish finance minister, Ms Anne Wibble, outlined
SKr81bn in savings for the years 1994-1998 as part of a strategy to
eliminate Sweden's structural budget deficit.
Of the SKr81bn savings, SKr61bn will come from limiting public consumption
and cutting benefits. Reform of the pensions system and increased income
through tax measures, including widening the VAT base, will account for
SKr20bn.
The government has now outlined savings amounting to SKr160m since it came
to power in September 1991 to help tackle a financial crisis caused by
rising unemployment, falling tax revenues, and the cost of bailing out its
stricken banking system.
The state's borrowing requirement is put at SKr233.9bn this year, rising to
SKr255.3bn next year. Interest on government debt will rise to SKr95bn next
year from SKr73.0bn in 1992-93.
Measures to tackle unemployment were highlighted yesterday, with a plan to
provide work experience and training to a further 130,000-140,000 people.
The aim is to cut official unemployment (excluding those on training
schemes) from 7.5 per cent to 7 per cent.
