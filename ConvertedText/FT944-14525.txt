FT  22 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Simple ID card would make for simpler
life


   From Mr WARREN EDWARDES


Sir, To my chagrin, my Spanish wife can enter and leave the UK with no more
than a credit card-sized ID card. Furthermore, in many countries ID cards
are essential for day-to-day business purposes, such as entering clients'
offices. Passports have to be carried in lieu of ID cards.
To avoid the hassle of carrying a passport while abroad I have made myself
an ID card. While consulting in South Africa last year, I stuck a photograph
on my UK driving licence and my client over-stamped it and signed it.
I have had no problems with my 'official' papers within and without the EU,
though I have not yet tried it at a frontier.
May I suggest a cheap and speedy low-tech ID card - the back cover of the
EU/UK passport. The blank reverse could contain the holder's signature,
driving licence and National Insurance details.
