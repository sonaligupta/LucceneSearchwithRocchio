Sir William Ryrie, the former chief executive of the World Bank's
International Finance Corporation, has been appointed deputy chairman of the
British government-backed Commonwealth Development Corporation which lends
money in over 50 countries.
Sir William, who will be 66 next week, stepped down from the
Washington-based IFC earlier this year. He is an executive director of
Barings and was appointed to the CDC board in February. As a former
permanent secretary at the Overseas Development Administration, he knows
well both the CDC and the developing world. He takes over as deputy chairman
from Sir Michael Caine, 67, the former chairman of Booker, who has served on
the CDC board for nine years.
