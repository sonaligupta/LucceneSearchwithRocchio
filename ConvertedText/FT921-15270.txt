FT  11 JAN 92 / Letter: Scotland: a fitter engineering industry and
Ravenscraig as an asset in an independent nation (1)


   From Mr HOWARD JORDAN


Sir, I was delighted to read in Peter Norman's Economics Notebook (January
6) that Scotland was providing a ray of hope in the economic gloom pervading
the rest of the UK.
My delight came not only from the information but also because someone else
had confirmed what we at Scottish Engineering have been saying for some
time. In the FT on December 17, your correspondent, James Buxton, reported
the optimistic findings of our December Quarterly Review.
I have been saying for some time that the engineering industry in Scotland
is better prepared for this latest recession having, as you explained, gone
through a painful restructuring in the early and mid-1980s. Scottish
companies went into this latest recession leaner and fitter than many of
their English counterparts, and the benefits are now being felt.
Peter Norman's prediction that Scotland will sustain its improvement in
confidence and continue to attract successful businesses is heartening and,
hopefully, correct.
