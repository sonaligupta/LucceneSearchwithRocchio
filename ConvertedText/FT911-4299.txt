FT  19 APR 91 / International Company News: Tonka says yes to Hasbro


   By KAREN ZAGOR


HASBRO moved closer to cementing its position as the biggest US toymaker
yesterday when Tonka's board of directors recommended that shareholders
accept Hasbro's amended takeover offer, valued at Dollars 486m, writes Karen
Zagor.
Under the terms of the revised bid, Tonka's shareholders will receive
Dollars 5 a share instead of the previously offered Dollars 7, while
bondholders will get Dollars 300.2m for 90 per cent of the bonds, an
improvement of Dollars 43.2m on the earlier offer.
Bondholders had balked at the earlier bid, prompting Hasbro to revise its
offer.
Mr Stephen Shank, Tonka's chairman, said the board had decided the offers
was in the best interest of shareholders, given the company's recent losses,
the uncertain outlook for the rest of the year, the deterioration in the
bank lending environment for highly leveraged companies such as Tonka, and
the uncertain availability of bank financing to meet Tonka's seasonal
working capital needs.
Shares in both issues were actively traded yesterday, with Hasbro adding
Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 29 5/8 and Tonka closing unchanged at Dollars 4 3/4
