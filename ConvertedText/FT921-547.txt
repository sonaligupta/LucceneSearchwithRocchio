FT  28 MAR 92 / Finance & The Family (At A Glance): Property still gloomy


The news this week of the financial difficulties which have hit Olympia &
York, the world's biggest property developer, did nothing to help the ailing
fortunes of shares in the UK property sector.
These have been in decline for three years with only a false hope that a
recovery might be underway bolstering the sector about a year ago.
Both residential and commercial property have been badly hit by the
recession with little prospect of an upturn in the near future.
Most quoted property companies have a large exposure to London offices which
have suffered particularly sharp falls in value. A surge in building work at
the end of the 1980s has created a large oversupply of office space.
