FT  30 NOV 94 / International Company News: Metall buys back smelter stake

   TORONTO


Metall Mining has bought back from Germany's Metallgesellschaft, the
Toronto-based company's former parent, a 35 per cent stake in Norddeutsche
Affinerie, which is Europe's biggest custom copper smelter.
Metall will pay the ailing German industrial group CDollars 152m (USDollars
110m), including CDollars 40m in cash and the return of a CDollars 112m
promissory note.
The deal stems from Metallgesellschaft's disposal earlier this year of its
51 per cent stake in Metall. As part of the sale, Metall was obliged under
an agreement with Norddeutsche's other two shareholders to transfer its
stake in the copper smelter back to Metallgesellschaft.
Metall said that the other shareholders, MIM Holdings, the Australian mining
group, and Germany's Degussa, had agreed not to exercise their right of
first refusal on Metallgesellschaft's stake.
Mr Klaus Zeitler, Metall's president, said yesterday that the repurchase of
the Norddeutsche stake 'removes the last element of uncertainty arising from
Metall's former relationship with Metallgesellschaft'.
Metall's share price gained 38 cents in early trading on the Toronto stock
exchange yesterday to CDollars 11.50.
Norddeutsche produced 350,000 tonnes of copper cathode in the year to
September 30 1993, most of which was further processed into various shapes
and rod for manufacturing copper products.
