FT  14 APR 94 / Major backs 'exceptional' Commons lies


   By JAMES BLITZ


The prime minister has for the first time publicly backed a recent claim by
Mr William Waldegrave, the minister responsible for open government, that
ministers can lie to the Commons in exceptional circumstances.
In a letter to Mr Giles Radice, the Labour MP for Durham North, Mr John
Major says: 'It is clearly of paramount importance that ministers give
accurate and truthful information to the House.'
But the prime minister's letter goes on to say: 'If they knowingly fail to
do this, then they should relinquish their positions except in the quite
exceptional circumstances of which a devaluation or time of war or other
danger to national security have been quoted as examples.'
The prime minister responded to Mr Radice after he had written asking
whether it was the duty of ministers not to mislead parliament and to resign
if they do so.
The first exchange of letters followed a statement made by Mr Waldegrave to
the Treasury and civil service select committee, of which Mr Radice is a
member, that ministers had to lie to the Commons in exceptional
circumstances.
In particular, Mr Waldegrave claimed that Lord Callaghan, the former Labour
prime minister, had told untruths during the devaluation crisis of 1967.
This has been fiercely denied by Lord Callaghan, who was chancellor at the
time. He claims that he chose his words on the issue very carefully, and
that he has never lied to the Commons.
Until now, the prime minister has given only a guarded endorsement of Mr
Waldegrave's comments.
On a BBC programme in March, Mr Major said: 'Mr Waldegrave answered an
intelligent question frankly about what had happened under another
government a quarter of a century ago.'
Asked whether lying could be justified in parliament, he said: 'Nobody can
and nobody does.'
