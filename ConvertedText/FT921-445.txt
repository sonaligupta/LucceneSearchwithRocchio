FT  28 MAR 92 / Spitalfields market project comes nearer fruition


   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent


DEVELOPMENT of Spitalfields fruit and vegetable market in the City of London
has moved a step closer with the granting of outline consent by the London
Borough of Tower Hamlets.
The project, which involves building offices, shops and restaurants on the
12-acre site, now needs final approval from the environment secretary.
The plans for the first two buildings of the scheme, one of which is
designed by Sir Norman Foster, designer of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank
headquarters, were welcomed by the Corporation of London's planning and
communications committee. Sir Norman's building is designed to be a gateway
into the Spitalfields site. It has a series of external terraces that
provide a visual link between the big buildings on Broadgate and smaller
ones on the rest of the site.
Smithfield Development Group, the developer, is a partnership of BICC
Developments, Costain and London & Edinburgh Trust. It says its plans to
build 1.1m sq ft of offices, 68,000 sq ft of shops and 165 flats would
generate jobs for 7,000 people.
The community benefits offered by the developer in return for planning
permission include 118 flats and houses and a public leisure centre. The
Corporation of London has approved the first phase of Smithfield market's
Pounds 50m refurbishment. Work will start in the next couple of months on
bringing the market up to the standards required by EC hygiene rules.
