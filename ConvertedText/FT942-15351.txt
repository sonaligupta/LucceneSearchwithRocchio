FT  15 APR 94 / UK Company News: Laura Ashley up 67% to Pounds 3m


   By PEGGY HOLLINGER


Laura Ashley yesterday remained tight-lipped about the sudden departure of
its American-born chief executive as it announced a 67 per cent increase in
pre-tax profits to Pounds 3m, writes Peggy Hollinger.
However, it became increasingly clear that the boardroom split, which
resulted in the announcement this week of Mr Jim Maxmin's departure, had
been less than amicable.
Mr Maxmin was present yesterday to announce the results of the company which
he led back to profit during his three-year stint. He was relaxed and
confident - as long as questions were focused on the business.
Sales were ahead 13 per cent, after accounting for currency effects, at
Pounds 300.4m, with gross profit 8 per cent higher at Pounds 158.4m on the
same basis. Earnings rose from 0.35p to 0.45p.
The group also reported substantial progress in rectifying problems which
resulted in heavy losses in the US last year. This gave many analysts
encouragement to speculate that a dividend more meaningful than 1993-94's
maintained 0.1p might be paid this year. 'If things are looking fair, a
dividend of about 1p would not be unreasonable,' said one analyst.
When asked about the reasons for his departure, Mr Maxmin's replies were
more abrupt and the questions were often fielded by Mr Andrew Higginson,
finance director. 'Jim left us with a superb strategy and a business in good
shape to take advantage of future opportunities,' he said. 'There has
clearly been a disagreement at board level and that is all we can say.'
Mr Hugh Blakeway Webb, who will become executive chairman in May, did not
attend the meeting. Mr Maxmin said he was in negotiations over compensation
which is expected to total more than Pounds 600,000 after accounting for
share options and performance-related bonuses.
