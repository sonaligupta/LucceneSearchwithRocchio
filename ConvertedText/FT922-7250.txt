FT  19 MAY 92 / International Company News: State-run utilities in link


   By AP-DJ and REUTER


   MADRID, DARMSTADT


ELECTRICITE de France plans to tighten links with the Spanish state-run
utility Empresa Nacional de Electricidad (Endesa) but a share swap is out of
the question, according to Mr Pierre Delaporte, EdF chairman, AP-DJ reports
from Madrid.
Mr Delaporte said the state-owned EdF had signed an agreement with Endesa to
collaborate in coal production centres in the Spanish towns of Puertollano
and Teruel.
Endesa, meanwhile, would contribute to the operations at EdF's nuclear
energy plant in Civeaux. However, the chairman denied speculation that a
share swap took place.
Endesa and EdF are also discussing making a joint bid in the privatisation
of the Argentine energy distributor Servicios Electricos del Gran Buenos
Aires (Segba).

Telefonica, Spain's state-run telecommunications monopoly, announced
yesterday that net profit rose 12.9 per cent to P12.2bn (Dollars 119.6m) in
the first quarter of 1992, Reuter reports from Madrid.
Telefonica attributed the rise to efforts to contain costs and to a strong
increase in operating income.
*****
Wella, the German haircare and cosmetics group, saw a sharper rise in net
profit than in sales in 1991, but it remained a long way from its stated
goal of a 4 per cent return on turnover, Reuter reports from Darmstadt.
The company said its group net profit had risen 7.2 per cent to DM81.7m
(Dollars 49.8m) while sales had gained 5.6 per cent to DM2.71bn. This made
the return on sales just above 3 per cent.
