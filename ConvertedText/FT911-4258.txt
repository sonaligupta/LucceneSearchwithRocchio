FT  20 APR 91 / UK Company News: BP proposals to reduce tax bill


   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES


BRITISH Petroleum yesterday met officials from the Inland Revenue to discuss
proposals for cutting its tax bill by issuing shares in its Britoil
subsidiary to BP shareholders.
BP would make no further comment on the plan, but one tax specialist said
the Inland Revenue could take a dim view of the proposals.
Since the stapled shares would be offered free to shareholders, they could
be classed as a dividend payment and therefore be liable for advanced
corporation tax, he said.
In addition, the Inland Revenue could also take the view that BP was joining
with shareholders to evade tax.
The way the plan would work is that shareholders would be offered redeemable
preference shares with a nominal value in Britoil which would be stapled to
BP shares. The shareholders would then be able to elect to receive a
dividend payment from Britoil instead of from BP.
There would be no cash incentive for them to do this but, by paying its
dividends through Britoil, BP would be able to save money.
The plan would give BP the chance to offset the payments of ACT it makes on
dividends against Britoil's tax liabilities.
That would save BP about Pounds 150m in the first year of operation of the
plan and would add an extra 2p onto its earnings per share this year if the
scheme goes ahead. Since the shares would be stapled to BP shares, they
would not be eligible for trading in their own right. In addition, BP would
have to redeem the shares at some point which could mean making a small
payment to shareholders.
But BP stressed that it needed to put a lot more work into its plan before
it could be finalised.
The proposals would have little relevance for companies outside the oil
industry since they can get round this problem in other ways.
