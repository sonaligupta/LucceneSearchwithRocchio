   By REUTER


   PHOENIX, ARIZONA


PHELPS DODGE, the largest US copper producer, blamed low copper prices for a
decline in second-quarter earnings and revenues, although company officials
insisted the results were still generally positive, Reuter reports from
Phoenix, Arizona.
Net income fell to Dollars 43.6m, or 66 cents a share, from Dollars 65.8m,
or 94 cents, a year earlier on sales of Dollars 629.8m, down from Dollars
663.3m.
First-half net income amounted to Dollars 106.6m, or Dollars 1.51 a share.
This compared with Dollars 117.8m, or Dollars 1.67, in the same period last
year before allowing for an accounting adjustment of Dollars 79.9m which
lowered the 1992 net to Dollars 37.9m or 54 cents a share. First-half sales
were Dollars 1.29bn, up from Dollars 1.25bn.
