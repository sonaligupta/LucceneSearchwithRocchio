FT  13 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Simplistic polemic is no answer


   From Mr SIMON MARTIN


Sir, Christopher Dunkley's article, 'Nature, nurture and nastiness' (April
9/10), is symptomatic of a distressing journalistic tendency, increasingly
in evidence even in quality newspapers such as yours, to engage in sophism
under the misapprehension that it makes good copy.
Nobody, be they 'expert' or simply possessed of an ordinary degree of common
sense, would argue that video nasties cause violent crime, which is entirely
the thrust of Mr Dunkley's argument.
The opinion offered by Professor Elizabeth Newson and her cohort of
'experts' (and undoubtedly shared by many of those lesser mortals possessed
of the common sense just referred to) is that there is probably a link
between the two.
An article that attempted to change this opinion by use of reasoned
argument, backed up by cogent supporting research, would be both interesting
and informative, as well as adding to the quality of debate on what is an
important point. To read a simplistic polemic that takes as its starting
point an entirely false premise does not have these (or any other) benefits.
