FT  21 APR 94 / MEPs ride through EU law


   By PRESS ASSOCIATION


   STRASBOURG


Euro-MPs are preparing to exercise their newly-won powers of 'co-decision'
under the Maastricht treaty by rejecting a proposed EU law banning powerful
motor-cycles. MEPs have responded to public outcry and look certain to
overturn a decision by EU governments limiting motor-cycle engines to 100
brake horse power. 'This started out as an issue about the power of bikes:
it turned into an issue about the power of this Parliament,' said
campaigning British conservative MEP Mr Peter Beazley yesterday.
