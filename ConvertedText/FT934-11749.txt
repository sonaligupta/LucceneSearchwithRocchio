FT  29 OCT 93 / International Company News: Fond 92-94 to vote against
amalgamation


   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES


FOND 92-94, one of Volvo's prominent institutional shareholders, said
yesterday that it would vote against the planned merger of the company's car
and truck operations with Renault, Christopher Brown-Humes writes.
Its board decided unanimously that the merger should not take place before
Renault had been privatised and had gained a market value.
Fond 92-94 has 2.5 per cent of the votes in Volvo and 2.8 per cent of the
capital. It is the first institution to declare its position since Volvo
published its merger prospectus earlier this week. Its decision was not
unexpected because of tensions between the fund's management and the Volvo
board.
