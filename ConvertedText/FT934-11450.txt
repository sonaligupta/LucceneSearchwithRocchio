FT  01 NOV 93 / Airbus loses Dollars 590m Sri Lanka order


   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent


THE Sri Lanka government is to cancel an order for five Airbus A340 long
range aircraft worth Dollars 590m (Pounds 391m) for its national airline
Airlanka.
The decision is a further blow to the European Airbus consortium which has
suffered more cancellations so far this year than new aircraft orders.
The current prolonged recession in the commercial airliner business has
prompted a call from Mr Jean Pierson, the Airbus managing director, for a
reform of the consortium's structure to increase its overall
competitiveness. It won only 23 new orders during the first nine months of
this year, and has also faced heavy cancellations and order deferrals.
Mr Ranil Wickremasinghe, the Sri Lankan prime minister, said in a weekend
newspaper interview in Colombo that the government had informed the World
Bank of the decision to cancel the A340 orders.
The original purchase had been criticised by the bank and Sri Lankan
opposition leaders as extravagant. However, Mr Wickremasinghe said the
government was open to renegotiating a contract with Airbus 'if conditions
are acceptable'.
Airbus officials are understood to have met Mr Sepala Attygalle, Airlanka's
chairman, last week to discuss the possibility of a more favourable contract
for the airline.
