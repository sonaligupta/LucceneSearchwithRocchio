FT  21 NOV 92 / Major relishes credit for deal


   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor


MR JOHN MAJOR last night appeared on the steps of Downing Street to
characterise the Gatt agreement between Europe and the US as 'the best
possible news' for the world economy and a triumph for the British
presidency of the European Community.
Exuberant that his intensive diplomacy over the past few weeks had helped
avert a transatlantic trade war, Mr Major voiced confidence that the
outstanding issues in the Uruguay trade round would be quickly settled.
The British prime minister, who has harangued and harassed Mr Jacques
Delors, the EC Commission president, to ensure the Community's negotiators
reached an agreement with Washington, won the immediate congratulations of
Mr Howard Davies, the director general of the Confederation of British
Industry. 'It's quite clear that the prime minister was personally involved
and we congratulate him for it . . . It would have been very serious to have
no settlement,' Mr Davies said.
US President George Bush yesterday also praised Mr Major for 'his key role
in the negotiations'.
Mr Major, who has been desperate for a diplomatic success to stem a rising
tide of criticism from other governments in Europe as well as his own
electorate at home, brushed aside suggestions that France might yet seek to
veto the deal.
Reminding reporters that the Community's decision could be based on
qualified majority voting, he commented: 'I don't believe Europe will say No
to this deal when it is finally concluded.'
