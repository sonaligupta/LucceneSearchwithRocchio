FT  11 JAN 92 / Finance & The Family: Bristol & West equity bond


Bristol & West Building Society has launched a guaranteed equity bond, which
offers investors the chance to match the rise in the FT-SE 100 index over
three or five years, with a guaranteed base return. The minimum return over
three years is 9 per cent gross, and 25 per cent gross over five years. The
disadvantages are that the investor does not receive any income, and that
any gain on the bond is subject to income, not capital gains tax.
