FT  01 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Mild winter retards Anglo United


   By ROLAND RUDD


ANGLO UNITED, owner of the Coalite smokeless fuel business, announced
yesterday that it had cut its dividend and renegotiated its debt repayment
schedule as profits for the year to end-March fell by 48 per cent.
The mild winter and continuing recession dented profits before tax, which
fell from Pounds 15.7m to Pounds 8.3m on sales from ongoing businesses up
from Pounds 537.2m to Pounds 555.9m.
Exceptional profits of Pounds 5.3m were achieved from the sale of a number
of small assets against Pounds 7.8m last time.
Earnings per share were down at 1.9p (5.1p). Mr David McErlain, chairman,
said it would be imprudent to pay an uncovered dividend. The final was
therefore reduced from 1.4p to 0.65p, making a total of 0.85p (1.6p).
'It may not be what many fund managers wanted to see but it's the right
decision. The cut in the total dividend was in line with the profit fall. If
profits increase so will the dividend,' he added.
After missing a debt repayment of Pounds 17m in February, Anglo has
renegotiated its debt repayment schedule, relating to the 1989 purchase of
Coalite for Pounds 478m, enabling it to pay off debt with proceeds from
disposals.
Anglo's disposal programme of its non-core businesses has been affected by
the recession. Liquid fuel and chemicals are likely to be sold for less than
the Pounds 70m-Pounds 80m Anglo originally wanted after trading profits fell
from Pounds 17.8m to Pounds 9m.
Other businesses, including Pozament, a manufacturer of waterproof grouts,
and Seaham Harbour Dock Company saw profits fall from Pounds 8.2m to Pounds
4.7m.
Solid fuel manufacturing and distribution, the smokeless fuel business,
reported unchanged trading profits of Pounds 21.6m - about Pounds 6m below
the budgeted figure due to the exceptionally mild winter.
Overall trading profit fell from Pounds 48.8m to Pounds 35.4m. The interest
charge decreased from Pounds 42.9m to Pounds 32.6m as debt fell from Pounds
233m to Pounds 196m.
COMMENT
An exceptionally mild winter and difficult trading conditions have frozen
Anglo's ambition to buy some of British Coal's assets. The company's last
quarter tells a sorry story: trading profits down from Pounds 24m to Pounds
12m, mainly because of the mild winter. As trading profits of Anglo's
non-core businesses tumbled so it has become much harder to find buyers. If
it still manages to achieve the Pounds 70m of planned disposals by next year
and has better luck with the weather British Coal will be back in its
sights. The dividend cut, while unexpected, was the right thing to do given
the fall in profits. Forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 12m and earnings of
2.3p put the shares, which fell  1/2 p to close at 13 1/2 p, at a
prospective multiple of 6 - a 58 per cent discount to the market.
