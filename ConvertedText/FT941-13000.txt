FT  27 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Control Techniques moves eastward


Control Techniques, the Powys-based electronic drives and controls company,
has opened its first 'drive centre' in the former eastern bloc through a
Brno-based joint venture with Vues, its Czech distributor.
CT wants to take full advantage of the surge in industrial growth caused by
economic reform in both the Czech and Slovak republics. This, it said, has
opened up new opportunities in industries such as metal, paper, glass and
power generation.
CT's drive centres, a key element in its recent expansion, provide
engineering system building and problem solving expertise close to its
largest customer base, the users of small and medium-sized drive systems.
