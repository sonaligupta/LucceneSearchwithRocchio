FT  29 JAN 92 / Observer: Bat's life


It was one of those cruel coincidences. On the very day that Labour launched
a poster campaign to ridicule Norman Lamont by adorning him with black mask
and cape and labelling him Vatman, a ministerial colleague was answering an
important parliamentary question. The subject: the protection of certain
species of bats on development sites. The chancellor can take heart, though,
from the assurance of Nicholas Bennett, the Welsh minister, that the
government intends to enforce vigorously the 1981 Wildlife and Countryside
Act to ensure bats survive any upturn in the economy.
