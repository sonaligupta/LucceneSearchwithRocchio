FT  16 DEC 94 / International Company News: Setback for Fuji Photo Film


   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO

Fuji Photo Film yesterday cited fierce competition in the domestic market
and the sharp appreciation of the yen as the main factors behind a 4 per
cent drop in full-year nonconsolidated recurring profits.
Revenues in the year to October 20 fell 6 per cent to Y798.6bn (Dollars
7.96bn) and recurring profits - before extraordinary items and tax -
declined to Y120.9bn amid a difficult trading environment. Net profits were
4 per cent lower at Y67.9bn.
Trading was slow in all divisions, in spite of the introduction of new
products such as the world's smallest and lightest 8mm video camera.
The company was adversely affected by intense competition both at home and
abroad, as core markets remained stagnant amid sluggish private capital
spending.
Price cuts undermined efforts by the company to reduce costs through
rationalisation measures.
In spite of the moderate recovery in the domestic market, Fuji Photo Film
expects the trading environment to remain difficult.
The company will report results for a shortened financial year as it is
changing its year-end to March 31 from October 20. It is forecasting sales
of Y346bn, recurring profits of Y50bn and net profits of Y27bn for the five
months and 11 days to the end of March.
