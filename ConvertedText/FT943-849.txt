FT  27 SEP 94 / International Company News: Nextel plans Dollars 78m deal to
buy AMS

   SAN FRANCISCO


Nextel Communications, which aims to create a US-wide wireless
communications system, has announced plans to acquire American Mobile
Systems for stock in a deal valued at about Dollars 78m.
Last year Nextel reached agreement to acquire up to 61 per cent of AMS for
cash and certain assets. The restructuring of the agreement into a non-cash
transaction follows the cancellation of MCI's plans to acquire a 17 per cent
stake in Nextel for Dollars 1.3bn.
The previous agreement between Nextel and AMS will be terminated when the
companies enter into a definitive merger agreement.
Nextel is pressing ahead with plans to create a nationwide wireless
communications service combining voice, data, paging and radio dispatch. It
recently expanded its services in California to cover San Francisco,
Sacramento and Los Angeles.
