FT  02 NOV 93 / Ceiling on bias payouts to end


   By RICHARD DONKIN


THE GOVERNMENT is to abolish the Pounds 11,000 compensation ceiling in race
and sex discrimination cases, Richard Donkin writes.
The decision was forced on the government by the European Court of Justice,
which ruled in August that Britain's statutory ceiling was unlawful. The
government has gone further than the EC law required and decided also to
abolish the limits for racial discrimination, and for religious
discrimination in Northern Ireland.
Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, said he hoped that regulations to
abolish the compensation ceiling for sex discrimination would come into
force later this month. Amending the penalties for other forms of
discrimination will take longer, since it requires primary legislation.
The move prompted speculation that the government may have to concede at
some stage that the Pounds 11,000 limit on Industrial Tribunal cases of
unfair dismissal is no longer tenable.
Mr David Pannick QC, who has been examining the implications of the European
Court ruling, said there was nothing in EC law that barred an upper limit
for unfair dismissal claims. He added: 'There is a strong arguement that no
rational distinction can be drawn between unfair treatment of one sort and
unfair treatment of another.'
