FT  06 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Norwich and Scottish Life maintain trends


   By BETHAN HUTTON


Norwich Union, the mutual insurance group, yesterday announced unchanged
bonuses on its with-profits endowment policies, while Scottish Life, the
mutual life assurance company, cut its bonuses slightly, writes Bethan
Hutton.
The net effect for both was to continue the trend of slightly higher
pay-outs for 25-year maturities, but lower pay-outs after 10 years.
Norwich Union will pay Pounds 58,694 for a standard 25-year endowment policy
maturing on January 1 1994, up 0.8 per cent from last year's Pounds 58,237,
giving a yield of 12.9 per cent (12.8 per cent).
Figures are based on the standard industry assumptions of a policy started
by a man aged 29, paying Pounds 30 a month.
A 10-year policy, using the same assumptions, would pay Pounds 6,674, down
4.5 per cent from last year's pay-out of Pounds 6,992. This would give a
reduced yield of 11.9 per cent (12.7 per cent).
Scottish Life will pay Pounds 6,105 for a 10-year policy, down 2 per cent,
representing net returns of 10.2 per cent. A 25-year policy would pay Pounds
63,252 this year, up 2 per cent, a return of 13.3 per cent.
Pay-outs on 10-year endowments are still falling because of poor investment
performance in 1990-92, and in compensation for excessively high bonuses in
1990, while 25-year policies benefit from the higher average investment
returns in the 1980s.
Norwich describes its current bonus rates as 'realistic', but projects
falling rates over the next two years because of low inflation.
