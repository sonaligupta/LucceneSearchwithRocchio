FT  06 AUG 93 / Observer: On the job


Is there a chief executive of a Footsie company who has done more
globe-trotting than Reuters' Peter Job? So far this year, he has ventured
from his Fleet Street headquarters to visit 19 countries - some as many as
four times. Throughout his career with the financial information and news
group, Job reckons he has been to 69 different countries.
Any advance on that?
