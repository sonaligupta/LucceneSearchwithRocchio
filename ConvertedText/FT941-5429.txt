FT  07 MAR 94 / Short fuse on Tories' Budget timebomb: On Budget day the
Financial Times asked individual taxpayers for their assessment. Now five of
them have been shown details of what they will have to pay from next month.

It is one thing to read about the Tory 'tax bombshell' but it is entirely
different to feel one detonate in your pocket.
'Good God,' said Professor Richard Joyner, a scientist at Liverpool
University, on learning that his annual tax bill will rise by nearly Pounds
1,000. 'I was expecting direct tax increases of around Pounds 600 but I had
no idea that indirect taxes would be so high.'
Prof Joyner was one of the people who gave an immediate reaction to the
Financial Times last November to the Budget. Now they have responded to a
tax evaluation carried out for the FT by accountants Touche Ross which shows
the impact of proposed tax increases on their disposable income.
Spending on luxuries such as holidays are likely to be the main casualties
of the tax rises which will hit pay packets from next month, the survey
found. A large part of the tax increases result from the chancellor's
freezing of most tax allowances and restricting mortgage interest relief.
National Insurance contributions will increase by one percentage point to 10
per cent.
Prof Joyner, will pay Pounds 435 a year more in direct tax. 'We will
probably spend less on holidays,' he said. He might also postpone buying a
replacement car.
Mr Sean Cockburn, 23, a quality manager at a plating factory, and his
girlfriend, Ms Karen Jewers, a 29-year-old nurse, have just taken out a
mortgage. They face an annual tax rise of Pounds 243 on their combined
salary of Pounds 28,600. Mr Cockburn said: 'I try to run my house like a
business, finding the cheapest, most reliable suppliers.'
The couple has already been forced to try to apply business principles to
Karen's two cats, which cost about Pounds 300 a year in food, cat litter,
toys and baskets. But the cats turned up their noses at discounted food
bought in bulk and the couple have instead cut down on smoking and going
out. Ms Jewers said she would probably trade down in the shops she used.
Ms Sylvie Pierce, chief executive of Reading Borough Council, is facing a
tax increase of Pounds 596. On a salary of Pounds 65,000, she feels it would
be 'undignified to complain'. But she will do what many other people may
find themselves doing in the face of higher tax bills. 'I shall just
increase my overdraft,' she said. 'I suppose I may make economies at the
margins.'
The increases could have significant effects on the lifestyle of some
people. Ms Suzana Radovic, a teacher and single mother on a salary of Pounds
25,000, will be cutting back on basics to accommodate the Pounds 473 rise in
her tax bill. 'It will actually affect my main spending on things like food
and I'll be extra careful about heating,' she said. 'We will have to adjust
what we spend on basics because it is quite a sizeable amount of our
income.' Ms Radovic said that if she had to pay for childcare she would not
be able to afford it. At the moment she relies on her mother.
It is the prospect of such personal economies, small savings and cuts in
spending, multiplied across the population, which is provoking fears that
the recovery may be cut short. The Confederation of British Industry said
last month that retail sales had not risen as much as expected at the
beginning of the year, and that consumer confidence in general was low in
anticipation of the tax increases.
The Budget did produce a bright spot for pensioner Mr Leslie Thomson, 76, a
former Lloyd's underwriter. He said: 'The introduction of the pensioners'
guaranteed income bond is a very good thing for a chap like me and I have
invested in it quite largely. I put Pounds 15,000 in and that will produce
about 2 per cent per annum better than in other investments that a chap like
me can make.'
This nest egg and a modest lifestyle have put Mr Thomas and his wife in a
position where a Pounds 117 tax increase will not destroy their personal
budget. However other aspects of the Budget horrify him. 'I think the VAT on
fuel is an absolute shocker. The badly-off pensioner probably spends a very
large proportion of their income on keeping warm and this VAT is going to
add to it.'
As a public servant, Ms Pierce is also worried about the potential effect of
the tax rises on her community. She said: 'My concern is about the impact of
the changes on people who are already living absolutely at the edge. There
are a lot of people living like that in the community I work for. The
recovery is pretty fragile so the impact on the local economy worries me.'
Even if the economic consequences of the tax rises are less far-reaching
than feared, the government may still face some political fall-out. It
raises the issue of whether taxpayers feel they were misled by the 1992
election campaign, in which the Tories campaigned as the party of low
taxation and warned of a tax bombshell if Labour won.
According to Mr Thomson this is most definitely so. 'I think they misled the
public and ran a campaign frightening the wits out of the public into not
voting for Labour.'
Prof Joyner agrees. He said: 'I would say they are the party of less
well-funded public services. But that does not excuse the dishonesty the
electorate has been subjected to.'
But Mr Cockburn is a loyalist. His tax bill would not, he said, affect his
support for the Conservatives. 'I'll still stick by them,' he vowed.
