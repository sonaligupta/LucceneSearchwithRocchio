25%

Scott Paper, the Philadelphia-based manufacturer of personal care paper
products and printing papers, is to cut its worldwide workforce by 25 per
cent, or 8,300 employees.
The company took a Dollars 381m charge on fourth-quarter earnings to cover
the job cuts. More than half of the lay-offs, or about 4,500 jobs, will
occur in its international operations and affiliates.
The company intends to shut down some of its older tissue manufacturing
plants in the US and Europe and to restructure its coated paper business.
Both businesses have been pressured by worldwide overcapacity and
competitive pricing. Scott said its affiliate in Mexico would restructure.
Mr Philip Lippincott, Scott's chairman, said the workforce reductions should
bring the company's employment rate into line with its lowest-cost
competitors.
'These actions are part of our efforts to take control of our destiny in the
slow-growth, highly-competitive and value-focused environment of the 1990s,'
he said.
Before the restructuring charge, Scott reported fourth-quarter earnings fell
to Dollars 34.4m, or 46 cents a share, from Dollars 44.8m or 61 cents per
share in the same quarter last year. Including the charge, Scott had a loss
of Dollars 379.3m or Dollars 5.01 per share for the quarter.
Scott's fourth-quarter sales were Dollars 1.20bn, down from Dollars 1.28bn
in the same 1992 quarter.
For the year, before special charges, Scott had income of Dollars 177.6m or
Dollars 1.58 per share, down from Dollars 167.2m or Dollars 2.26 last year.
With charges, Scott had a loss of Dollars 277m or Dollars 3.75 for the year.
Scott's 1993 sales were Dollars 4.7bn, down from Dollars 5bn the previous
year. The company's debt increased by Dollars 201m during 1993.
Scott's European operations were hit by lower sales and unfavourable foreign
exchange conversions. Outside the US, the company's operating income
declined 26 per cent, and sales were down 20 per cent. Within the US,
Scott's operating income slid 14 per cent, while sales were flat.
Scott's operating income from its printing paper business dropped to Dollars
79.6m in 1993, from Dollars 90.8m in 1992, while its personal care and
cleaning paper lines saw income slide to Dollars 306.6m, from Dollars 374.7m
the previous year.
