FT  29 OCT 93 / International Company News: All Nippon Airways has first
reverse in 10 years

A FALL in passengers in both international and domestic flights hit All
Nippon Airways, a leading Japanese airline, which reported falls in interim
sales and profits for the first time in 10 years.
Unconsolidated pre-tax profits for the first half plunged 62.5 per cent to
Y6.5bn (Dollars 59.9m) while sales declined 4.8 per cent to Y404.4bn.
After-tax profits dropped 80.8 per cent to Y1.3bn.
Domestic passengers fell 5.7 per cent to 16.6m while the number of
passengers on international routes fell 4.4 per cent to 770,682.
Mr Kazuhiko Komiya, managing director, said the company would have fallen
into the red if it had not reduced depreciation costs by extending the
assumed life of an aircraft to 13 years from 10 years.
While the yen's appreciation against the dollar also supported ANA's profits
by pushing down fuel costs, it also squeezed revenue from its international
operations, forcing the company to suspend four international routes.
For the full year to March, the company expects a 62 per cent fall in
pre-tax profits to Y6bn on a 3.2 per cent decline in sales to Y782bn.
ANA does not expect to make after-tax profits for the year, but said it will
maintain its annual dividend of Y4 per share.
