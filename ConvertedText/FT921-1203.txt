   REUTER


   PRAGUE


THE Czechoslovak State Bank said yesterday it was lowering its discount rate
from 9.5 per cent to 9 per cent from today, Reuter reports from Prague. It
also abolished the maximum interest rate charged by commercial banks, which
has stood at 17 per cent since October. The bank said the measures were a
response to the growing stabilisation of consumer prices and favourable
balance of payments.
