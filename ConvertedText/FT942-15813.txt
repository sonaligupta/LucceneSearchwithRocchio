FT  13 APR 94 / International Company News: Union Carbide, 3M join implant
fund


   By RICHARD TOMKINS


   NEW YORK


Union Carbide and Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing are to contribute towards
the proposed Dollars 4bn global settlement of breast implant litigation
agreed by other US companies in March.
The settlement between makers of silicone implants and plaintiffs claiming
illnesses resulting from implant leaks should provide funds to settle
litigation worldwide over the next 30 years. It also provides a partial
ceiling on individual companies' liabilities.
The main corporate participants in the settlement, which is still subject to
fairness hearings and legal challenges, are Dow Corning (a joint venture
between Dow Chemical and Corning), Bristol-Myers Squibb and Baxter
International.
Union Carbide, the chemicals group, did not manufacture the implants but it
supplied generic bulk silicone materials to the implant industry. It said
its contribution to the settlement would be Dollars 138m over the next few
years.
The company said it had previously taken pre-tax charges totalling Dollars
35m for litigation, and the settlement would not require any charges in its
first or second quarters. After probable insurance recoveries, the effect on
future earnings should be negligible, it said.
3M, the diversified maker of medical products and adhesives, did make the
implants but had previously held out against joining the industry-wide
settlement. Subject to its directors' approval, it has now agreed to join
with a contribution of Dollars 325m.
The company said that, after this and other charges relating to breast
implant litigation and after probable insurance recoveries, it expected to
report a pre-tax charge of Dollars 35m in the first quarter, or Dollars 22m
after tax.
