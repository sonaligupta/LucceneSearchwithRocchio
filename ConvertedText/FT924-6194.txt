FT  23 NOV 92 / People: Gormly's helping hand at Royal


Allan Gormly is no stranger to corporate crises. Only a month after he was
appointed chief executive of the troubled Trafalgar House group, he is to be
made deputy chairman of Royal Insurance Holdings, the weakest of the big
composite insurers, from January 1.
Gormly, 54, has been a non-executive director of Royal for two years; some
observers will see his promotion as very much the handiwork of Sir John
Cuckney, Royal's chairman. Sir John, one of the City's best-connected
financiers, first came across Gormly when he was brought in to rescue John
Brown, the once-proud flagship of British engineering, in 1983.
Gormly, a Scottish accountant who joined John Brown in 1965, was plucked
from obscurity by Sir John and made chief executive. The two of them made a
good job of turning the company round; in 1986 it was sold to Trafalgar
House.
Although Sir John has been shedding some of his City responsibilities, such
as the chairmanship of 3i, he is spending a lot of his time on trying to
restore the fortunes of Royal Insurance, one of the grand old names of the
British insurance industry. Last year it reported a loss and had to cut its
dividend. There have been several changes in Royal's senior management team
and although the group's capital ratios need strengthening, analysts believe
its fortunes are on the mend.
Gormly's appointment as deputy is bound to fuel speculation that he could be
a future chairman of the Royal. Sir John, who took over the chairmanship
from Daniel Meinertzhagen seven years ago, is 67, and his other deputy
chairman, Sir Max Williams, a former senior partner of Clifford Chance, is
of a similar age.
