FT  21 JUL 94 / International Company News: Stores side helps boost net at
Sears Roebuck


   By RICHARD TOMKINS


Stronger results from its revamped stores helped Sears Roebuck, the US
retailing and insurance group, improve underlying net profits by almost 10
per cent, to Dollars 503.4m, in the second quarter.
Operating profits in the stores division shot up by 23 per cent, to Dollars
199.3m from Dollars 162.5m, driven by an 11 per cent increase in sales to
Dollars 7.6bn from Dollars 6.85bn.
Under the leadership of Mr Arthur Martinez, chief executive since 1992,
Sears Roebuck is well-advanced on a store remodelling programme aimed at
making the merchandise, and the stores themselves, more attractive to
customers.
The company said cost-reduction programmes initiated over the last year had
also helped the retailing results. Selling and administrative expenses as a
percentage of revenues fell to 26.6 per cent from 26.8 per cent. However,
the improvement was offset by the costs of an extensive advertising
campaign, leaving the gross margin unchanged at 28.9 per cent.
The international stores, Sears Mexico and Sears Canada, slashed their
losses to Dollars 800,000 from Dollars 5.2m last time.
Gains on the retailing side were partly offset by a fall in the contribution
from Allstate, the insurance company of which Sears Roebuck owns 80.1 per
cent. Net income after minority interests fell to Dollars 322.1m from
Dollars 371.8m, largely because of higher catastrophe losses.
Revenues for the group as a whole rose 7 per cent to Dollars 13.01bn. Net
income of Dollars 503.4m appeared to represent a decline from last time's
Dollars 1.09bn, but the year-ago figure included a Dollars 635.1m gain from
the sale of a minority interest in Allstate. On a like-for-like basis,
earnings per share on continuing operations rose to Dollars 1.27 from
Dollars 1.19.
For the first six months, net income on continuing operations fell from
Dollars 775.5m to Dollars 405.5m.
