FT  25 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Change in product mix behind Iceland's 15%
rise to Pounds 46.3m


   By PEGGY HOLLINGER


A CHANGE in product mix at Iceland Frozen Foods Holdings enticed more
customers into the retailer's high street shops and helped to lift profits
by 15 per cent from Pounds 40.3m to Pounds 46.3m in 1991.
Turnover rose by 23 per cent to Pounds 889.1m (Pounds 724.6m). Like-for-like
sales rose by 15 per cent. The number of customers through the door every
week had risen from 1.9m to 2.3m.
The increases were attributed to the higher proportion of chilled, as
opposed to frozen, foods in Iceland's stores. 'Times have changed and we are
not in the frozen food centre business any more,' said Mr Malcolm Walker,
chairman.
Growth would in future come mainly in chilled foods, he said, although he
added that frozen foods would remain integral to Iceland's strategy. The
company claims 15 per cent of the estimated Pounds 3.5bn UK market for
frozen foods, up from 12.5 per cent in 1990.
The increased proportion of chilled foods and dry groceries such as bread,
tea and coffee, had eroded operating margins from 7.1 per cent to 6.5 per
cent.
During the year the group opened 41 new stores, making a total of 532.
The group, which built up heavy borrowings following the Bejam purchase in
1989, cut gearing from 73 per cent to 54 per cent. A further fall to between
37 and 40 per cent is expected by the end of 1992.
Net debt was Pounds 73m, compared with Pounds 81m in 1990. Interest charges,
net of the Pounds 742,000 (Pounds 1.3m) capitalised on freehold
developments, fell a fraction to Pounds 11.2m (Pounds 11.3m)
The appliance business, inherited from Bejam, contributed Pounds 39.8m to
sales, a rise of 22 per cent, while the insurance division rose 9 per cent
to Pounds 11.3m.
Fully-diluted earnings per share rose from 27.5p to 32.1p. A final dividend
of 5.85p (4.9p) gives a total 8.5p (7.2p).
The shares rose 7p to close at 474p.
COMMENT
Iceland has done well to get over the painful integration of Bejam, and
better still to draw back those customers alienated at the end of 1990 by
the company's move upmarket. Yet the very philosophy which has given such
success is Iceland's potential Achilles heel. Bejam's difficulties stemmed
from its move towards being a middle range supermarket. Mr Walker
emphatically denies that Iceland will forget its frozen food strength, but
the risk is there. Furthermore, by its own admission, the value-led Iceland
is a main beneficiary of recession. As conditions ease, the question of
whither Iceland is bound to rear its head. The shares have had a good run in
the past 12 months, outperforming the market by the best part of 50 per
cent. Forecasts for next year are pitched at Pounds 54m. The p/e of a little
less than 13 leaves the shares on a premium to others in the food retailing
sector where the upside might be greater.
