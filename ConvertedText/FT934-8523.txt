FT  15 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Cazenove in link-up with Kiln Cotesworth
Fund


   By RICHARD LAPPER


CAZENOVE, the stockbroker, has linked up with another Lloyd's investment
trust, following the failure of efforts earlier this week to raise capital
for the Nelson Lloyd's Trust.
Cazenove will make a market in shares of the Kiln Cotesworth Corporate
Capital Fund, a Pounds 10m fund launched by an offer for subscription by
Baring Brothers last month.
Kiln is listing the trust on the Stock Exchange where shares will trade on a
matched bargain basis. Kiln will provide capacity of between Pounds 18m and
Pounds 18.5m to 22 syndicates, eight of which are managed by the Kiln and
Cotesworth managing agencies. Other syndicates are managed by Murray
Lawrence, Wren and Wellington. Kiln and Cotesworth members agency will merge
to form Kiln Cotesworth next January.
Cazenove linked up with Lazard Brothers and the Octavian Group, one of the
Lloyd's market's largest agencies, to raise Pounds 60m for the Nelson
Lloyd's Trust.
A pathfinder prospectus was issued but the fund's directors said last
Tuesday that they had been unable to obtain sufficient backing from
institutional investors and withdrew the scheme.
