FT  01 JUL 92 / Heveningham Hall up for sale


Stately offer: one of Britain's most important neo-classical mansions is for
sale at a price of Pounds 4.5m. Heveningham Hall is a Grade I listed
Georgian building in Suffolk, built in 1752, with a 469-acre estate
landscaped by Capability Brown. Receivers Cork Gully were appointed last
year to sell the mansion after the death of Iraqi businessman Abdul Amir
Al-Ghazzi, who bought it from the government in 1981. Last December Mr
Michael Heseltine, then environment secretary, said he would not buy back
Heveningham - a right that was part of the 1981 sale agreement. His decision
came in spite of pressure from heritage campaigners to end what the Suffolk
Building Preservation Trust called 'a tragic catalogue of neglect,
misfortunes and disasters' since 1981. The National Trust said last November
that the mansion should not be 'put at risk' by another sale on the open
market.
