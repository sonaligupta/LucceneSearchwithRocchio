FT  14 APR 94 / Tyne's workforce falls to record low


   By CHRIS TIGHE


Tyne and Wear's economy outperformed the national average in the early part
of the recession, but setbacks in 1992-93 have resulted in the number of
employees in the county dropping to a post-war record low of 418,100, says a
report published yesterday.
The study, by the Tyne and Wear Research and Intelligence Unit, suggests the
county's official unemployment rate - 13.4 per cent in January - is a
substantial underestimate.
It argues that if 32,100 training scheme participants, under-18s and older
job-hunters ineligible for benefits are added to the 70,100 official jobless
claimants, the unemployment rate rises to 19.5 per cent of a labour force of
523,200.
Tyne and Wear's GDP grew by 5 per cent, against a 2 per cent UK decline, to
Pounds 8,734m during 1989/1991; manufacturing output grew 1 per cent and
productivity 4 per cent, against national falls of 14 per cent and 7 per
cent. Output per head rose from 84.9 per cent to 91.5 per cent of the UK
average.
But, the report says, between mid-1992 and mid-1993 the county lost 12,000
jobs, 2.8 per cent of its total across all industrial sectors. The UK figure
was 2.3 per cent.
