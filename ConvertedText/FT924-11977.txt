MINNESOTA Mining and Manufacturing Company, the adhesives and coatings
conglomerate, yesterday unveiled a 14 per cent increase in earnings. Net
income jumped to Dollars 338m or Dollars 1.54 per share in the
third-quarter, from Dollars 296m or Dollars 1.35 last year.
The results were slightly better than analysts had expected. Mr LD DeSimone,
chairman, said earnings benefited from a good performance in US
manufacturing operations, a weaker dollar and a lower tax rate.
Of the 19-cent share increase in quarterly earnings, the company said about
7 cents came from operations, about 7 cents from positive currency
translations, and about 4 cents from a lower corporate tax rate.
For the first nine months earnings rose to Dollars 948m, or Dollars 4.33,
from last year's Dollars 898m or Dollars 4.08 per share.
Sales advanced 6.6 per cent to Dollars 3.6bn in the quarter, from Dollars
3.38bn last year and for the first nine months they were up 3.9 per cent to
Dollars 10.51bn, from Dollars 10.12bn last time.
