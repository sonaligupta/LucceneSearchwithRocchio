Drought-stricken Zambia, one of the world's poorest and most indebted
countries, yesterday received pledges from western donor countries of more
than Dollars 400m in balance of payments and emergency imports support,
William Dawkins reports from Paris.
The pledges, which were made at a meeting of the World Bank consultative
group on Zambia, are a significant increase on previous years' aid. They
cover the country's financing requirements for the year so far, not
including the extra costs of the drought. Zambia needs Dollars 1.7bn of
external aid for the year as a whole.
