FT  29 APR 94 / UK Company News: Losses deepen to Pounds 1.53m at CI


   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent


Losses increased at CI Group, the Wolverhampton-based engineer, as it
absorbed the costs of selling an unprofitable French steel mill and a new
round of redundancies.
For the year to January 31, pre-tax losses were Pounds 1.53m (Pounds
338,000) after redundancy costs and disposal losses totalling Pounds 2.05m
(Pounds 2.85m). During the year Societe Metallurgique de Brevilly, the
French subsidiary, was sold and the workforce cut by 11 per cent to less
than 1,000.
Turnover was Pounds 66.7m (Pounds 65.6m) including Pounds 4.5m (Pounds
6.93m) from discontinued activities.
Losses per share rose to 1.54p (0.47p). However, the group is paying what Mr
Rob Yates, chief executive, called 'a very modest final dividend' of 0.1p as
a gesture of confidence for the present year. With an interim of 0.4p, which
was covered at the time, the total is 0.5p, half the previous year's 1p.
CI also announced that its new chairman would be Mr Robert Jordan, who until
1991 was chief executive of Foseco. He succeeds Mr Patrick McTighe who died
on April 17.
