FT  15 JUN 93 / Letter: Common IT standards are needed in the UK


   From Mr GORDON EWAN


Sir, Your article about the National Audit Office report into computer
systems for the Training and Enterprise Councils ('Scrapping Tecs computer
system may cost Pounds 50m', June 11) once more points to the importance of
nationally recognised - and implemented - standards for the information
technology community.
Only when we in the UK are all working to the same set of standards will we
be able to avoid the problems of 'them and us' when matching client needs
with the systems which are actually installed.
As the lead body for information technology standards in the UK, we have
been working for the past two years with all members of the IT community to
ensure that there is a clear set of practical guidelines for everyone
involved in information technology.
One of the ways of ensuring this happens is through the programme of
National Vocational Qualifications in information technology. This is a set
of standards which all companies and organisations and their staff and
employees can use to build better skills and greater mutual understanding.
With Britain needing to become more skilled, productive and cost-effective
in its working methods, adopting the best practices woven into our set of IT
standards surely makes a lot of sense and helps avoid expensive and
time-consuming problems.
