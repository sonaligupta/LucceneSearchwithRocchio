FT  21 APR 94 / Number employed is higher than thought


   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent


Some 326,000 more people are in employment than had previously been thought,
revised statistics published yesterday by the Department of Employment have
found.
The total workforce in employment in the UK at the end of last December is
now estimated at 24,705,000, an increase of 326,000 on the original
estimate.
The change in the figures reflects a shift in employment patterns towards
services, small businesses and self-employment. The Department of Employment
said that about two-thirds of its employment estimates are based on figures
taken from a panel of businesses. Previously this panel was made up of
representative companies from a 1989 census of employment, but a 1991
employment census has updated the sample to reflect economic shifts.
Studies have shown that employment in very small workplaces (one to five
people) has been growing while that in all other sizes of workplace has been
falling. The majority of the 'missing jobs' found by the new survey were
among the self-employed.
The revisions mean that the slump between the peak in employment in June
1990 and the trough in March 1993 was less than had previously been
estimated. The recovery between March and December 1993 was also less than
had been thought.
Part-time jobs continue to fuel the growth in employment. Between December
1992 and December 1993, part-time employment rose by 122,000 while full-time
jobs fell by 106,000. Self-employment rose by 66,000 over the year while the
number of employees fell by 2,000.
The long-term decline in manufacturing employment seems to have halted. Jobs
in the sector rose by 3,000 in February, following an increase of 5,000 in
January. The revisions show that at the end of 1993 manufacturing employment
was 95,000 higher than previous estimates.
The 30,300 seasonally adjusted fall in unemployment in March means that over
the six months to March the jobless count has fallen by an average 29,900
each month. February's decline was revised to 37,700 from the 38,800
previously announced. In all, 324,600 people joined the jobless count in
March, while 360,600 left it.
Every region saw a fall in unemployment in March for both men and women,
except Northern Ireland, where female joblessness rose slightly. Northern
Ireland remains the region with the largest percentage of unemployed people;
East Anglia has the smallest proportion.
The number of unfilled vacancies at Jobcentres declined by 1,300, on a
seasonally adjusted basis, between February and March. The total now stands
at 139,800.
Financial incentives are not the only influence on working patterns, and the
government's labour market policy must take into account other
considerations if it is to be effective, the Policy Studies Institute says
today.
The report from the independent think-tank cites the assumption that women
married to newly unemployed men do not increase their paid employment
because of disincentives in the benefits system. In fact, it says,
non-financial factors such as the 'complementarity' between the leisure of
husbands and wives is just as important.
