FT  29 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Works councils not costly, nor a
cause of delays


   From Mr BERT THIERRON


Sir, In your article, 'EU works council costs put at Pounds 1m' (April 22),
the Engineering Employers' Federation claimed that European works councils
would cost Pounds 1m a year and Unice, the European employers' organisation,
added that the existence of these consultative bodies would delay
decision-making in multinational companies by three months.
The European Metalworkers' Federation has in the past three years organised
150 meetings for workers' representatives from multinational companies in
the metal sector. These meetings cost between Pounds 10,000 and Pounds
40,000 each depending on the number of participants and the number of
countries and languages involved. Our experience tells us that these are
realistic figures provided the meetings are not held in five-star hotels,
participants do not travel first class and meals are not taken in three-star
restaurants.
With regard to the delay in decision-making, I would like to draw your
attention to the 18 European works councils already existing in the metal
sector. Many of these voluntary agreements between management and workers'
representatives of multinational companies include provisions for
consultation procedures. So far, not a single manager has reproached the
workers' side for trying to delay decisions. In all cases management has
tried to obtain support for planned action through the force of good
argument.
Should you be interested in further details about the advantages and costs
of European works councils I would suggest you contact those multinational
companies which have practical experience with these bodies. The EMF would
be more than willing to provide you with 18 company names and addresses.
