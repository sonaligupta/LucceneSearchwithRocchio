FT  20 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Transitional accord' move to
boost coffee market

   SAO PAULO


BRAZILIAN and Columbian officials hope to forge a 'transitional' accord, to
boost the currently depressed coffee market, at the September meeting on the
International Coffee Agreement. They believe that some clauses can be ready
to take effect as early as October.
This position emerged from a Monday meeting in Rio de Janeiro of
representatives of the two governments. They now plan to canvass Indonesia
and leading producers in central America and Africa in an attempt to build a
consensus among producers at their meeting in London on 27 May. That
gathering is in preparation for the coming round of negotiations with
consumers in late June.
Brazilian private sector sources say that the initiative for the fast-track
transitional pact comes from the Colombians. Some of them doubt whether a
consensual agreement can be hammered out in such a short period of time.
