FT  22 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: TV lead


   From Mr DAVID DOCHERTY


Sir, ITV's claim of a 50 per cent increase in its lead over BBC1
misrepresents the facts ('ITV claims advance over Sky channels', July 20).
The reverse is true. The gap so far this year has narrowed. BBC1 has held
its ground against the ever-widening choices offered by satellite and cable
and ITV has lost some share.
Moreover, BBC1 has achieved this stability with a much more diverse schedule
than ITV - in which religion, current affairs, challenging documentaries,
and music programmes retain a secure place in peak-time. As a footnote, your
story also ignores the fact that the terrestrial channels take a 65-70 per
cent share in cable and satellite homes.
