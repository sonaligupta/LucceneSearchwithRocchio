FT  26 MAY 93 / International Company News: US mining groups to merge


   By LAURIE MORSE


   CHICAGO


AMAX and Cyprus Minerals, two of North America's largest integrated mining
companies, have agreed to combine most of their core operations to become
Cyprus-Amax.
The new company will have assets of about Dollars 5bn and total revenues of
Dollars 2.8bn, on the basis of 1992 figures. It will be the second-largest
copper company and the second-largest coal company in the US.
Prior to the merger, Alumax, Amax's big aluminium producing subsidiary, will
be spun off to Amax shareholders as an independent company. Amax will also
distribute a 28 per cent interest in Amax Gold to Amax shareholders.
About 32 per cent of Amax Gold is held by the public. Amax Gold had year-end
reserves of about 8.6m ounces.
The deal comes in the wake of Amax losses for 1992 of Dollars 148m, or
Dollars 1.71 per share, before special charges, on sales of Dollars 3.7bn.
The company passed its June dividend. Alumax, which produces two-thirds of
Amax's revenues, had a first-ever operating loss of Dollars 51m.
Mr Milton Ward, Cyprus president, estimates the merger will allow the
combined operations to make annual cost-savings of more than Dollars 100m.
As well as share positions in Alumax and Amax Gold, Amax shareholders will
receive one Cyprus share for each five Amax shares held, subject to
adjustments for price fluctuations in Cyprus stock. At the end of April,
there were 87.9m Amax shares and 47.3m Cyprus shares outstanding.
Cyprus-Amax will assume about Dollars 1.2bn of Amax's long-term obligations,
leaving Alumax with about Dollars 800m of Amax's remaining debt.
