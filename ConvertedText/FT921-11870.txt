FT  29 JAN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar falls on consumer poll


   By SIMON LONDON


The dollar weakened sharply on the foreign exchange markets yesterday
following the release of a confidence survey which damped hopes of a
consumer-led recovery in the US economy, writes Simon London.
The consumer confidence index registered 50.4 this month, down from 52.5 in
December. The dollar fell sharply as a result from DM1.6050 immediately
before the announcement to a low of DM1.5925.
Overnight in the Far East the dollar was confined to a tight range. The US
currency closed in Tokyo at Y125.37, from Y125.25 in New York, and DM1.6095
from DM1.6105.
The yen was also weak against the D-Mark. The German currency regained
recent losses to push up to Y78.00 during the Tokyo day.
The Japanese unit was weak as economic data released yesterday confirmed
that the Japanese economy is slowing and increased expectations of an early
cut in interest rates.
Retail sales grew at a rate of just 1 per cent during December, from a 4.5
per cent rate of increas in November. Industrial production fell by 0.9 per
cent in December from November, and now stands down 1.4 per cent on December
1990.
In the light of the figures, analysts saw the Japanese currency weakening
through resistance levels at Y125.50 against the dollar before falling Y127,
the level at which central banks intervened earlier in the month.
In European trading the dollar was confined to its tight ranges until the
consumer confidence figures were released but the yen continued to weaken,
falling through resistance levels against both the dollar and D-Mark. The
Japanese currency fell to lows of Y125.95 against the dollar and Y78.66
against the D-Mark before stabilising.
The dollar closed in London at DM1.5965 from DM1.6165 on Monday; Y125.60
from Y125.50; Dollars 1.7955 from Dollars 1.7765 against sterling.
Within the European exchange rate mechanism, the D-Mark was soft again early
in the day but recovered ground through the afternoon session as its rallied
against the dollar.
The German currency was also supported by money supply figures which showed
M3 growing at a rate of 5.7 per cent in December from 5.1 per cent in
November. The Bundesbank's target range for M3 growth was 3 - 5 per cent,
suugesting that interest rates will be kept high to suppress money growth
and inflation. In the morning, the D-Mark fell below Pta63.00 against the
peseta, the strongest currency in the system, dropping to a low of Pta62.88
before recovering ground.
This raised sterling's floor within the system, determined by its maximum
permitted divergence against the Spanish currency. The UK currency rose in
line with the floor, peaking at DM2.8730 but falling back in the afternoon
in line with the dollar. By the close, sterling stood at DM2.8675, from
DM2.8725 on Monday.
