FT  01 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Prawn tariff irks Andean group


   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor


Andean countries are fighting a rearguard action against proposed revision
of the European Union preferential tariff regime which would impose tariffs
on their exports to Europe of shrimp and tuna. Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador
and Peru have enjoyed benefits under the EU's generalised system of
preferences since 1990 to encourage them in the fight against drugs. Under a
new regime of preferences, expected to come into force over the next month,
Venezuela is expected to be added to the list. An Andean customs union
incorporating all five countries is due to go into effect on January 1.
The regime, as proposed, would raise from zero the tariff on tuna to 24 per
cent and on prawns to 5-18 per cent. Governments from Ecuador, Colombia and
Venezuela have argued this will have a big impact on a sector that generates
much employment, often in poor regions. Mr Humberto de la Calle, Colombian
vice-president, is in Europe this week to press for concessions. He said the
industries employed 20,000 people in his country. The tariffs are being
urged largely by France, but also by Italy. Paris wants to protect its own
small tuna fishing fleet, but also the shrimp and tuna industry in French
Guyana.
