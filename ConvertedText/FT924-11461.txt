FT  26 OCT 92 / Letter: Too kind about a mugging


   From Mr WARREN OLIVER


Sir, Your front page headline is surely too kind to the UK government - or
am I making the common American mistake of failing to notice British irony.
'Cabinet thwarts Tory revolt' (October 22) is true only in the sense that a
New York pedestrian 'thwarts' a revolver-wielding mugger by immediately
handing over his wallet.
