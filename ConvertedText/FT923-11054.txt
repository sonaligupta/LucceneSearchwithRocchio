FT  27 JUL 92 / BR deals Labour an unkind cut


   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent


THE LABOUR party is about to learn that all direct InterCity rail services
to the Lancashire resort of Blackpool will be abolished on the day its
annual party conference opens there.
British Rail is expected to announce the decision next Monday, blaming it on
the need to cut costs in the face of the recession. It will come into effect
with the introduction of BR's autumn timetable on September 28.
The fact that the Labour conference opens on the same day is coincidental,
but the timing is likely to infuriate members planning to travel to and from
the conference by rail. Like other passengers heading for Blackpool, they
will now be able to go only as far as Preston by InterCity. They will then
have to wait for a local stopping service to take them on the 17 1/2 -mile
last leg of the journey.
The closure of the InterCity service will be bitterly resented in Blackpool.
The town drew 17m visitors last year and its economy depends heavily on
tourism and the conference market.
Lancashire County Council fears that the loss of direct rail links with the
rest of the country will affect Blackpool's ability to compete with other
resorts such as Brighton, East Sussex; and Bournemouth, Dorset, which have
frequent trains direct to the capital.
The ending of Blackpool's InterCity link is the latest in a series of moves
by BR aimed at cutting back the InterCity network to a profitable core.
InterCity services beyond Wolverhampton in the West Midlands to Shrewsbury
were abolished in May, and last month BR announced that InterCity services
to south Humberside would end in September.
Earlier this year Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, publicised a
memo by a BR employee claiming 15 services on the fringes of the InterCity
network were vulnerable to closure.
InterCity has been reviewing its services in the wake of a fall in operating
profits from Pounds 49.7m to Pounds 2m in the financial year to April.
