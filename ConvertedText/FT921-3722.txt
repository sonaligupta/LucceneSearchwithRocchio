FT  13 MAR 92 / Haiti army forces delay over return of Aristide


   By REUTER


   PORT-AU-PRINCE


BOWING to pressure from the army-backed provisional government, Haiti's
parliament yesterday delayed ratification of a proposed accord reinstating
ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Reuter reports from Port-au-Prince.
After meeting three government ministers, Senate Speaker Dejean Belizaire
said a special joint session of parliament's two houses to vote on the
accord was being postponed from yesterday to next Monday.
Members of the Chamber of Deputies, which wants to ratify the accord as soon
possible, accused Mr Belizaire of stalling on the government's behalf and
voiced fears of an outbreak of political violence.
It was the second time this week that the Senate's leader had delayed voting
on the accord, brokered by the Organisation of American States (OAS) and
aimed at settling the crisis set off by President Aristide's ouster in a
September 30 military coup.
The OAS has promised to lift a crippling trade embargo when the accord is
implemented.
Centrist Deputy Samuel Madistin said the government installed after the coup
was said to be holding out for two ministries in the incoming cabinet as a
guarantee it would not be investigated for corruption.
