FT  13 APR 94 / International Company News: Semiconductor shares in the US
fall sharply


   By LOUISE KEHOE

US semiconductor shares fell sharply on Wall Street as investors reacted to
a lack of growth in a leading indicator of sales trends in the industry and
disappointing first-quarter results from Motorola.
Motorola's share price dropped after the group reported first-quarter
results below analysts' expectations, despite a 46 per cent increase in net
profits.
After dropping by Dollars 6 3/4 , to Dollars 99 1/4 in after-hours trading
on Monday, Motorola declined further yesterday to trade at Dollars 95 3/8
late in the session after hitting a three-month low of Dollars 93 7/8.
Shares of other semiconductor manufacturers also dipped sharply, with Texas
Instruments down Dollars 4 1/2 to Dollars 74 1/8 , Intel down Dollars 3 3/16
to Dollars 66, Advanced Micro Devices down Dollars 2 to Dollars 25 5/8 and
Micron Technology down Dollars 5 1/8 to Dollars 86 1/4 in late trading.
The sell-off was triggered by disappointment in the monthly industry
orders-sales ratio figure, which was issued after the market closed on
Monday.
For March, the ratio of the value of orders taken versus the value of goods
sold was 1.13. This was flat with a revised figure for February and
represents a high point since last May. However, industry analysts had
anticipated an increase in the book to bill ratio to about 1.16 or above,
following an upward trend from the preliminary February figure of 1.15.
Mr Doug Andrey, statistical analyst at the Semiconductor Industry
Association, which publishes the data, noted that semiconductor orders
continue to grow faster than shipments.
Investors, however, saw the latest book to bill ratio as a negative
indicator for US semiconductor manufacturers. Similarly, the market focused
on slow growth in Motorola's orders for pagers and related communications
equipment, despite the company's overall strong results.
First-quarter net income rose to Dollars 298m , or Dollars 1.03 per share,
from Dollars 204m, or 72 cents per share in the same period last year. Sales
rose by 29 per cent to Dollars 4.69bn from Dollars 3.63bn.
