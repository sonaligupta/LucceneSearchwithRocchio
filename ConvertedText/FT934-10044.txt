FT  08 NOV 93 / Credit points to weak upturn


   By DANIEL GREEN


CONSUMER AND business credit figures published today indicate a steady but
weak recovery.
The Finance and Leasing Association, which represents companies providing
credit, finance and leasing, says that credit levels for the third quarter
of the year were at their highest levels since the recession started two
years ago.
Consumer credit, at Pounds 3.7bn, was 27 per cent higher than a year
earlier. Finance to businesses was up 14 per cent at Pounds 3.6bn, entirely
as a result of a 38 per cent rise in hire purchase. There was no change in
level of leasing.
Motor finance for consumers increased 35 per cent for new cars and 32 per
cent for used cars as the result of a buoyant August, traditionally a month
of high car sales.
Mr Tony Mallin, chairman of the association, said: 'Although the recovery
has been patchy to date, the third-quarter figures give real hope that the
upturn will continue.'
The Finance and Leasing Association's figures are higher than those from
Infolink, the credit information organisation. It measures credit inquiries,
rather than levels.
Retailing as a whole saw increases of between 6.6 per cent and 8.6 per cent
for the third quarter compared with the levels a year earlier.
Data on employment in small manufacturing companies, published today by the
Confederation of British Industry, also bring some hope for recovery.
Employment rose in the four months to October for the first time this year.
This contrasts with the picture of the UK manufacturing as a whole, where
employment is still falling and is expected to continue to fall for the next
four months, says the CBI.
The CBI's survey also found that more small companies plan to raise
investment than cut it.
