FT  03 SEP 93 / International Company News: US gas prices help to lift
British-Borneo


SHARPLY improved US gas prices and exploration successes, both in the North
Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, helped British-Borneo Petroleum Syndicate, the
oil and gas exploration and production company, lift after-tax profits by 42
per cent from Pounds 2.07m to Pounds 2.94m in the half year to June 30.
Tax totalled Pounds 439,000 (Pounds 186,000) and Mr Alan Gaynor, managing
director, said that following this year's changes to UK oil taxation the
planned oil exploration programme had been rebalanced.
That would mean increased activity in the Gulf of Mexico, he said, where, by
the year-end, the group expected to have drilled a further 12 wells.
Activity in the North Sea would also continue, with the group participating
in five exploration wells within the next six months.
Sir Douglas Morpeth, chairman, said strong cash flow from all operations had
enabled investment in oil and gas activities to continue and debt to be
reduced to Pounds 31.3m against Pounds 33.9m at end-December.
Turnover in the half year more than doubled to Pounds 13.1m (Pounds 6.15m).
Earnings per share amounted to 6.52p (4.6p) and the interim dividend is
maintained at 2.667p.
