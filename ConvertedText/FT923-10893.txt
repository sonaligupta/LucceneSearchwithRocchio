FT  28 JUL 92 / Names call for resignation of Lloyd's council


   By RICHARD LAPPER


THE RULING COUNCIL of Lloyd's faced resignation calls yesterday at an angry
extraordinary general meeting attended by more than 2,500 Names, the
individuals whose assets provide the market's capital.
The atmosphere was markedly more tense than at the annual meeting last
month, when Lloyd's reported its record losses of Pounds 2.06bn for the 1989
year.
The meeting set the agenda for a postal ballot in which all 32,000 Names
will vote on demands for further reforms to the insurance market. These
include a proposal to scrap a levy on all Names imposed last month.
During the meeting Mr David Coleridge, the chairman, confirmed that he would
resign at the end of this year and nominated Mr David Rowland, to take the
insurance market's top job.
Mr Rowland, chairman of Sedgwick, must seek election to the council before
he can become chairman. As the author of a reform programme, which Lloyd's
agreed to implement earlier this year, he has a lot of support within the
market.
The EGM followed an initiative by Mr Claud Gurney, who said Names had 'an
opportunity to say goodbye to the old order' which was characterised by
'incompetence and ineptitude'.
One Name backing the motions said the council was guilty of 'gross
dereliction of duty' and 'if members had an ounce of honour or a scintilla
of integrity the council would submit their resignations'.
Mr Neil Shaw, chairman of the Association of Lloyd's Members, which
represents 9,000 Names, urged Names to vote for a motion backing the council
and supporting the task force reform programme. The reforms - including a
modification of the principle of unlimited liability and the introduction of
corporate capital - would 'produce a new Lloyd's that is stronger and much
more efficiently managed and controlled', he said.
