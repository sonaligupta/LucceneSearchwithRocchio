FT  19 MAY 92 / People: Approval for Nikko's Gemm


As the body responsible for organising the government's bond market
borrowings, the Bank of England still sees the gilts market as sacred
territory. It will go to considerable lengths to ensure an orderly market,
including keeping an eye on the staffing of gilt-edged market-makers, or
GEMMs.
Yesterday, Nikko Securities, the fourth largest Japanese securities house,
completed a delicate approval process to become the 20th GEMM.
Nikko is not the first Japanese firm to stake out a pitch. Nomura and Daiwa
joined in 1988.
The firm appears to have taken a very Japanese, consensual attitude in
assembling a team of gilts traders - no team hirings or high-profile
poaching from other market markers. 'We didn't want to put any noses out of
joint,' says Philip Busfield, head of sales and trading.
Busfield himself joined from Credit Suisse First Boston, the US investment
bank; Peter Gibbens, senior trader, joins from Bankers Trust; other staff
come from Goldman Sachs, Midland Montagu, Kleinwort Benson, Credit Lyonnais
and Seccombe Marshall.
However, seasoned gilts market participants have a different explanation for
the diversity of Nikko's recruitment: the Old Lady still regards team
poaching as ungentlemanly conduct, and can make the approval process as
arduous as it chooses.
