Sri Lanka's economy grew 6.7 per cent in 1993 compared with 5.6 per cent in
1992, according to Mr HB Dissanayake, central bank governor, Reuter reports
from Colombo.
'There was a significant growth in the manufacturing, industrial and service
sectors. Tourism went up and construction grew,' he said. The upward trend
would go on as long as market-oriented policies were continued.
He said both direct foreign investment and portfolio investment had
increased considerably in 1993. Inflation was now at 11-12 per cent, down
from 20 per cent a few years ago. The authorities say inflation will remain
high as long as the country needs to spend large amounts on security and
defence.
Sri Lanka spends around SRs20bn (Dollars 408m) each year to fight Tamil
separatist rebels who are trying to carve out a state for the minority Tamil
community in the north and east. Tamil separatist rebels have denied
involvement in bomb attacks on tourist hotels in the capital Colombo last
week. Tamils said the denial by the main rebel group, the Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam, was carried on rebel radio on Sunday.
