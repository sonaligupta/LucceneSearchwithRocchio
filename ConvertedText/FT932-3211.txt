FT  15 JUN 93 / International Company News: Coles Myer sells stake in NZ
supermarket group

COLES MYER, the Australian retailer, has sold for NZDollars 128.2m
(USDollars 69.6m) its remaining 38.1 per cent stake in Progressive
Enterprises, the New Zealand supermarket operator it bought in 1988 then
floated in March last year.
Mr Peter Bartels, chief executive, said the buyer was Foodland Associates,
the Western Australian supermarket group, at NZDollars 2.00 a share.
Mr Bartels said funds raised from the sale would be used to expand Coles
Myer's remaining interests in New Zealand which included the Kmart and
Katies chains and retail property investments.
'Maintaining a minority interest in Progressive Enterprises does not sit
well with our future strategy in New Zealand where we are committed to
expanding strongly in the non-food retail sector,' he said
Mr Bartels said Foodland was already a significant participant in New
Zealand supermarkets, owning the Rattray and Countdown chains.
He said two of Coles Myer's four directors on the Progressive board would
step down immediately and the other two would step down on completion of the
sale which required approval from New Zealand regulatory authorities.
