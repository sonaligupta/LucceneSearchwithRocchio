FT  12 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Some progress in EC-US talks says
MacSharry


   By ANDREW HILL and DAVID BUCHAN


   STRASBOURG, BRUSSELS


'SOME progress' has occurred in EC-US talks on farm subsidies, still the
chief sticking-point in Gatt's stalled Uruguay Round negotiations on world
trade liberalisation, Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, said
yesterday.
But he played down the significance of a letter President Bush sent to Mr
Jacques Delors, Commission president, last week. The letter suggested that
more of the direct-income support the EC plans to pay its farmers could be
shielded from the full brunt of farm subsidy cuts under Gatt.
Mr MacSharry, in Strasbourg to hear the European Parliament's opinion on
farm reform, refused to comment on details of EC-US talks or on Tuesday's
exchange on Gatt between Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, and Mr
Delors. 'We are continuing to discuss a package of issues. We have some
progress to report in some areas, but there are still major outstanding
difficulties.'
Brussels officials said the Commission would send Mr Bush an early reply,
perhaps today. They were taken aback on Tuesday, when, at a press conference
on Yugoslavia, Mr Baker mentioned almost ironically, the 'extraordinarily
generous' US offer in the Gatt negotiations. Some movement had occurred,
'but nothing in the context of the package (under discussion) to make one
say there's going to be an agreement tomorrow,' Mr MacSharry said. He was
still optimistic the Uruguay Round could be ended by mid-April.
Brussels officials declined to comment on yesterday's talks between aides to
Mr Delors and Mr Baker. The US has seemed to be moving nearer the EC
position in Gatt, mainly on EC plans to compensate farmers for price cuts.
But problems still exist over elements such as export subsidy cuts.
