FT  27 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading


Stock index futures had another troubled day, but volume improved and there
was evident relief when the long rumoured big stock loss trade did not
materialise.
The FT-SE December contract spent most of the day following rather than
driving the cash market, moving down to a low point of 2,987 around 1pm
before recovering to close at 3,009.
At this level the contract sells at a premium to the cash market of around
nine points, with the fair value premium extending to 18.4 points.
The locals - independent traders - made a number of testing runs when the
contract dipped below 3,000 but dealers said the market showed a surprising
degree of resilience.
There was a suggestion from major specialist that the futures market might
now be close to some sort of base, given its goodish volume yesterday which
included occasional flashes of genuine business.
The day saw 15,546 contracts, up from 12,700 on Friday and an average for
last week of less than 13,000.
Traded option volume was 39,507 lots, against 42.979 in previous session.
FT-SE and Euro-FT-SE volume combined fell just short of 22,000 lots.
The most actively traded individual stock options were Hanson with 1,771
lots, Argyll Group with 1,550 and British Steel with 1,330.
