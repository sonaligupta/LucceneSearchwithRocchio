FT  22 JUL 93 / Observer: Off the hook


Let's hear no more carping from bankers about the Pacific hagfish. The
scales of justice have at last proved it innocent.
Pacific hagfish is the source of 'eel skin leather' used to make wallets,
which has been blamed for damaging the magnetic strips on credit cards. But
though the allegation has been swallowed hook, line and sinker by banks'
customer service staff, they caught a tartar in passing it on to Edward
Melvin.
An American biologist with special research interests in the hagfish, he
promptly investigated. The rumour just doesn't hold water, he now says. The
real culprit is the magnetic clasps fitted to many eel-skin wallets.
