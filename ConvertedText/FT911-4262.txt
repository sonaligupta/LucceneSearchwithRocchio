FT  20 APR 91 / Letter: Change set to merely heighten the confusion


   From Mr HUGH HENDRY


Sir, I was dismayed by your article on the revision in the Japanese
commercial code ('Japanese scrip issues lose their bonus label', April 11).
The move to compel companies to refer to gratis issues as stock splits
reveals an alarming ignorance on behalf of Japan's omnipresent bureaucracy.
A gratis issue is a completely different animal from a stock split.
The former represents issues at nominal value but without charge to existing
shareholders and are principally designed to bring the company's share
capital back into line with the assets employed within the business. Stock
splits on the other hand, simply represent the division of existing share
capital into a greater number of shares, thereby reducing the nominal value
per share.
Given investors' traditional hostility to issues made above nominal value,
Japanese corporations have historically favoured gratis issues as their
principal signalling mechanism. As such, this high-profile change seems
destined only to heighten the confusion.
