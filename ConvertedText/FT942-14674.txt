FT  19 APR 94 / International Company News: Abitibi slides deeper into red


   By BERNARD SIMON


Abitibi-Price, the world's biggest newsprint producer, continued to post
losses in the first quarter. However, it expressed confidence that signs of
stronger US consumption would bring an improvement later this year.
The Toronto-based company posted a CDollars 43.9m (USDollars 31.7m) loss
from continuing operations, equal to 57 cents a share, up from a loss of
CDollars 27.9m, or 40 cents, a year earlier.
However, the latest quarter includes a CDollars 21.6m write-down on a
newsprint mill in Manitoba, which the company is handing over to its
employees.
Sales rose to CDollars 471.6m from CDollars 454.7m.
Average US newsprint selling prices were 3 per cent lower than in the
previous three months, and 6 per cent below the first quarter of 1993.
Predictions of an improvement are based on signs of rising newsprint
consumption and a sharp fall in customer inventories.
Like other North American newsprint producers, Abitibi announced a reduction
in discounts from March 1. It said it had implemented a 7 per cent cut.
Offshore newsprint shipments were 27 per cent higher, and US dollar prices
rose by 4 per cent against the previous quarter.
The market for uncoated groundwood papers, Abitibi's other speciality, has
been stronger, with sales volumes up 7 per cent over the past year.
Consumption of super-calendered papers, used for advertising flyers and
magazines, was especially buoyant.
