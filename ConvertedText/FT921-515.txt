FT  28 MAR 92 / Weekend London: Good British food


   By NICHOLAS LANDER


DESPITE the recent renaissance of the British chef/restaurateur London can
still boast some gastronomic outposts which combine a sense of history and
good British food. For the quintessential fish and chips, Grahame's Seafare
W1, The Sea Shell NW1 and Brady's SW18. For the true lover of eels, any
fashion, FE Cooke E18. For simple roast meat, often the most difficult dish
in any restaurant, Simpsons in-the-Strand WC2. For game, Rules in Covent
Garden, WC2. For its beef cobbler, The Goring Hotel, SW1 and, for
traditional British puddings, Gilbert's SW7 and The Greenhouse W1. Two
personal favourites are Wilton's, W1, and for supper pre- or post-theatre,
The Upstairs Bar at the Savoy Hotel, WC2.
