FT  29 JAN 92 / Ban on shift women lifted


   By QUENTIN PEEL


JUST months before its 100th anniversary, a German ban on night shift work
for women manual workers has been overturned by the country's supreme
constitutional court as an offence against equal rights, reports Quentin
Peel.
Yesterday it was overturned on the challenge of a woman clerk in a bakery.
She had been fined for taking on women to pack cakes on the night shift.
