FT  10 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Buoyant AMD reports surge in
sales for quarter

ADVANCED Micro Devices, the Silicon Valley semi-conductor manufacturer,
reported a surge in fourth-quarter sales and a 'virtual stampede of
customers' ordering its version of the 386 micro-processor, the chip used to
power many of the most popular personal computer models.
'In an otherwise lacklustre semiconductor market, all of AMD's growth came
from micro-processors,' said Mr WJ Sanders, chairman and chief executive.
Last year, AMD mounted a challenge to rival Intel's dominance of the
personal computer microprocessor market by launching its own versions of
Intel's widely-used 386 chips.
The companies are involved in a series of complex legal disputes over AMD's
rights to produce the microprocessors.
Fourth-quarter revenues rose by nearly 38 per cent from the like period a
year ago. AMD reported record revenues of Dollars 366.2m and net income of
Dollars 106.7m before payment of preferred stock dividends.
After the preferred dividend, quarterly net income was Dollars 1.17 per
common share. Operating results for the quarter included a charge of Dollars
7m in connection with plans to close down one of the company's oldest
production lines in the second quarter of 1992.
