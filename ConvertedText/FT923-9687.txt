FT  04 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Lep Group


In April last year, the then chairman and chief executive of Lep expressed
cautious optimism. So even though they must have known that something was
amiss, investors are entitled to some surprise at the way Pounds 200m in
shareholders' funds have since been transformed into a Pounds 100m deficit.
Even with a skilful company doctor at the helm, the terms of yesterday's
restructuring agreement suggest a long struggle to secure the group's
future.
At least Lep has no truculent Swiss bondholders to grapple with. But,
unusually, it requires the support of overseas banks not covered by the
agreement. The auditor's report recognises as much, pointing out that Lep's
future as a going concern depends on the willingness of overseas lenders to
back freight forwarding subsidiaries with overdrafts, letters of credit and
the like. The qualification may explain the performance of Lep shares
yesterday: almost doubling to 10p when the proposals were released but
falling to 6 3/4 p by the close.
The banks have shown how serious the situation is by converting debt into
equity at a 300 per cent premium to the market value. That could also imply
an expectation that the restructuring proposals will succeed. Otherwise they
might have gone for seniority by converting into preferred stock. But what
value seniority when the company shows post-restructuring borrowing of
Pounds 330m and tangible assets of Pounds 250m?
