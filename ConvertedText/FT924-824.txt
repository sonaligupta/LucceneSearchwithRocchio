FT  22 DEC 92 / Management (The Growing Business): How to become leader of
the pack


Persuading small business owners to make use of written sources of
information to improve their management techniques is difficult enough.
Expecting them to make use of the complex work packs beloved of academics
and some professional advisers is even more of a challenge.
Nevertheless, for the highly self-disciplined entrepreneur or the person
following a training course, these packs can prove useful. Starting Up: A
Step by Step Guide to Establishing and Running Your Own Business by etc*, a
consultancy firm, provides a 40-minute video, textbook and workbook to help
in the preparation of a business plan.
Users should expect to spend 100 hours but at the end will have gained an
insight into planning, filled in knowledge gaps and made their mistakes on
paper rather than in business, the pack promises. There are much cheaper
handbooks available though they do not take readers so rigorously through
the preparatory stages.
