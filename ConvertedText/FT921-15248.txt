FT  11 JAN 92 / Money Markets: UK rates stay soft


   By SIMON LONDON


The Bank of England again moved early to cap any potential pressure for
higher UK money market interest rates yesterday, in the face of a
substantial liquidity shortage and sterling's continued weakness on the
foreign exchange markets, writes Simon London.
The bank forecast a Pounds 1.8bn liquidity shortage in early morning, later
revised up to Pounds 2bn. The main factor squeezing liquidity was the expiry
of existing repurchase agreements totalling nearly Pounds 900m.
However, following the pattern set on Thursday, the Bank of England relieved
almost all of the shortage with early assistance. The Bank injected Pounds
1.78bn in total, purchasing Pounds 1.312bn paper outright. This comprised
purchases of band 1 and band 2 bank bills, both at 10 3/8 per cent.
In addition, the bank purchased Pounds 468m for resale to the market at 10
7/16 per cent in equal amounts on January 27 and 28.
This early round of assistance immediately took the steam out of pressure
for higher rates. The unsecured overnight money rate fell to below 9 per
cent in the morning session, from 10 - 9 3/4 per cent on Thursday, and the
Bank did not inject additional liquidity in late morning.
In the afternoon session the Bank injected a further Pounds 50m by
purchasing band 1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent. Late assistance of Pounds
35m bought the total liquidity injection for the day at Pounds 1.865bn or
Pounds 135m below the forecast funds shortage for the day.
By the close, overnight money was trading at 10 3/4 -  1/2 per cent;
one-month interbank money at 10 -  5/8 per cent; and three-month interbank
money at 10 5/8 -  1/2 per cent, the same level as Thursday.
The March short sterling futures contract on the London International
Financial Futures Exchange traded up to 89.54 during the day but fell back
to close at 89.46, 5 points lower than the close on Thursday. This level
implies base lending rates of 10.54 per cent by the spring, compared to a
current level of 10.5 per cent.
In Frankfurt, call money was steady at 9.40/50 per cent, unchanged from
Thursday, despite the strong rally in bond yields at the longer maturities.
Bond yields fell and the D-Mark weakened on the foreign exchange markets on
expectations that German interests may fall sooner than expected.
