FT  26 JUN 92 / Government Bonds: Gilts move higher as trading remains
buoyant

UK GOVERNMENT bonds gained more than a quarter of a point as the market
remained buoyant in the wake of Wednesday's successful auction of long-dated
stock.
The Bank of England sold Pounds 2.75bn of 9 per cent Treasury stock due 2012
on Wednesday in its largest-ever gilt auction. Long-dated gilt issues
underperformed in the run-up to the auction because of concern about the
large amount of stock due to go on sale.
However, dealers said that with the auction no longer overhanging the long
end of the market, longer-dated issues are likely to stage a rally,
recouping some of the losses made in the wake of the Danish referendum on
the Maastricht Treaty and ahead of the auction itself.
Dealers warned that the market will be looking ahead to this weekend's EC
meeting in Lisbon for further developments on European economic and monetary
union.
The Liffe gilt futures contract opened at 97.26 and reached a high of 98.00
before slipping back to 97.28. In the cash market, the benchmark 11 3/4 per
cent gilt due 2003/07 rose from 115 25/32 to trade at 116 3/32 by late
afternoon.
GERMAN government bonds slipped back yesterday after rumours circulated that
there may be a new 10-year Federal bond issue next month. The bund futures
contract opened at 87.70 and fell from its high of 87.77 to close at 87.63.
News that inflation in the western German state of Baden-Wurttemberg rose
0.3 per cent in the month to mid-June, giving a 4.2 per cent year-on-year
increase, had little impact on the bund market, dealers said, even though
this represents a slowdown compared with a 4.4 per cent year-on-year rise in
May.
Dealers noted steady buying of Belgian government debt by investors
switching into the D-Mark bloc, leading to a further tightening in the yield
spread over Germany and France. In the last week, 10-year Belgian-German
yield spreads have narrowed from 95 basis points to 87 basis points.
US Treasury prices rose yesterday in response to news of an unexpected
increase in weekly jobless claims.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  19/32 at 102
9/16 , yielding 7.77 per cent. The two-year note was up  1/8 at 100 3/16
yielding 4.88 per cent.
The buying was sparked by the Labor Department's announcement that in the
week ended June 13 initial claims for state unemployment insurance rose
16,000. The figures surprised the market, which had been expected a modest
decline in claims, and boosted hopes that the Federal Reserve might cut
interest rates to stimulate the flagging economic recovery.
The Fed's key policy-making Open Market Committee meets next Tuesday and
Wednesday to review monetary policy, and bond investors hope that a string
of recent bearish economic data will persuade the FOMC to sanction a policy
ease.
JAPANESE government bonds rallied early yesterday, helped by a strong yen
and firmness in US Treasury bonds overnight. However, profit-taking late in
the session left bond prices only marginally higher on the day.
The yield on the benchmark No 129 issue moved from its opening of 5.32 per
cent to reach 5.285 per cent, but ended the day at 5.315 per cent after
substantial profit-taking. The futures contract climbed from 102.66 to a
high of 102.85 but closed at 102.58 after heavy selling.
