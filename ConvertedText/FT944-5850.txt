FT  01 DEC 94 / International Company News: Securities foray takes toll on
Bank of Nova Scotia


   By BERNARD SIMON


   TORONTO


Bank of Nova Scotia suffered a one-third drop in fiscal 1994 earnings, due
to one-time charges stemming mainly from its forays into the trust and
securities businesses.
But the bank, which has the most extensive international operations among
Canada's big six banks, posted record fourth-quarter earnings. Profits for
the year would have been at an all-time high were it not for the
restructuring charge.
The strong underlying performance was reflected in a two-cent increase in
the quarterly dividend to 31 cents.
Net earnings for the year fell to CDollars 482m (USDollars 349.7m), or
CDollars 1.76 a share, from CDollars 714m, or CDollars 2.98. Excluding the
charges, income rose 10.2 per cent to CDollars 787m. The charges stemmed
mainly from the purchase earlier this year of Montreal Trust, and
accelerated amortisation of goodwill at Scotia-McLeod, the securities firm
acquired in 1988.
Fourth-quarter income grew to CDollars 205m, or 81 cents a share, from
CDollars 194m, or 80 cents. Return on equity slipped from 14.9 to 14 per
cent. Loan-loss provisions for the year rose to CDollars 567m from CDollars
465m. Non-performing loans shrank 25 per cent to CDollars 1.6bn.
The bank also said that Mr Peter Godsoe, currently chief executive and
president, is to become chairman in place of Mr CE Ritchie. Mr Godsoe
remains chief executive.
