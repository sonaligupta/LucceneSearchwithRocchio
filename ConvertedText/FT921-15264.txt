FT  11 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Pepe margins hit as profits fall 13%


   By ANDREW BOLGER


PEPE GROUP, the USM-quoted jeans designer and distributor, said the
recession had caused a significant move by customers towards cheaper brands,
particularly in the UK, writes Andrew Bolger.
Pre-tax profits fell by 13 per cent, from Pounds 3.57m to Pounds 3.09m, in
the six months to September 29, in spite of a slight increase in sales from
Pounds 81.3m to Pounds 82m.
Mr Arun Shah, chairman, said the year started positively butconditions had
become progressively more difficult. Consumer markets remained weak, and
competition intensified.
An exceptional charge of Pounds 490,000 (Pounds 166,000) was incurred from
the rationalisation of the group's French subsidiary, Buffalo, and UK
operations. Extraordinary charges of Pounds 499,000 were made to cover the
closure of the Norwegian operation.
Mr Shah said despite a difficult trading environment, overseas growth had
continued and such sales now accounted for 80 per cent of turnover, up from
75 per cent.
Turnover in the US and Spain rose by more than 100 per cent and 70 per cent
respectively, and profits also showed strong growth. Results in Germany were
below expectations.
Earnings per share fell from 7.8p to 6.2p and the interim dividend is cut
from 2.5p to 2p. The decision on the final will be taken in the light of the
year's results, and the decrease should not be seen as an indication of
future dividend levels.
Overall stock levels had been reduced by 20 per cent over the past year. The
balance sheet was strengthened by aPounds 9.4m convertible preference share
issue in July, although the interest costs benefits would not be seen until
the second half. The interest charge in the first half rose from Pounds
2.42m to Pounds 2.51m. Gearing was down from 90 per cent to 45 per cent.
Trade debtors - despite slower collections as a result of weak markets  -
were also well under control.
