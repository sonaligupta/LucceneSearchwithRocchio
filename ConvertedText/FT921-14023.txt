FT  17 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Olivetti jobs go as two UK subsidiaries
merge


   By ALAN CANE


OLIVETTI Office and Olivetti Systems and Networks, two UK operating
subsidiaries of Olivetti, the Italian office equipment and computer maker,
are to be merged into one company with the loss of some 65 jobs, about 4 per
cent of the workforce.
The move is part of a worldwide reorganisation Olivetti is putting in place
to deal with declining sales and profitability. The new company, with
headquarters in Putney, London, will be called Olivetti UK and be run by Mr
Paolo Tosi, formerly managing director of Olivetti Systems. Mr John Kernick,
ex-managing director of Olivetti Office, has left the company.
Until 1990 the company was known as British Olivetti in the UK, to play down
its Italian parentage; in that year it was divided into the office division,
dealing with low end personal computers and typewriters, and Systems,
dealing with computer systems in anticipation of a growing market for
computer equipment.
The recession in the US and Europe, coupled with a significant decline in
the price of computer hardware, has meant that the market has shrunk rather
than grown. Olivetti said earlier this week its sales last year declined by
about 5 per cent.
While the group worldwide has almost certainly incurred a loss, the UK
subsidiary performed well, with pre-tax profits of Pounds 4m on sales of
Pounds 75m at the half way mark.
