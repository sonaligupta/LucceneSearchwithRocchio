FT  12 NOV 92 / International Company News: Siemens boosts profits by 8.9%

NET profits at Siemens, the German electrical and electronics group, rose
8.9 per cent to DM1.95bn (Dollars 1.22bn) in the year to the end of
September, the company said yesterday. The dividend will be unchanged at
DM13 a share.
The result, in line with group forecasts, was achieved on sales up 7.7 per
cent at DM78.6bn. This was around DM1bn below target due to the recent
strength of the D-Mark against foreign currencies, a spokesman said.
Powerful growth in core businesses such as telecommunications, power plant
and motor components was partly offset by continuing losses in the
Siemens-Nixdorf computer subsidiary, which increased sales by 7 per cent to
DM13bn, and semiconductor manufacture. The full results from Siemens-Nixdorf
are due out today. While the deficit at Nixdorf was 'much less' than the
DM781m last year, it was still big, and losses from semiconductors increased
further, the spokesman added.
The company also reported a slow-down in new order growth. After a rise of
21 per cent a year earlier, total orders last year rose only 4 per cent.
Domestic bookings were up 9 per cent at DM40bn and foreign orders slipped
marginally to DM45bn.
The group, which published its provisional results with little comment and
gave no forecasts for the current year, is clearly feeling the effects of
the economic slowdown. While the workforce rose 3 per cent to 413,000 during
the year, after correction for the effects of acquisitions it fell 14,000.
A further 2,300 jobs are scheduled to go by the end of 1995 in the
semiconductor division.
