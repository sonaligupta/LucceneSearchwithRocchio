FT  15 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Auto components venture agreed


   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent


Sumitomo Light Metal of Japan and Norway's Hydro Aluminium have formally
agreed to collaborate in the development of automotive components using
aluminium extrusions, writes Kenneth Gooding, Mining Correspondent.
Hydro is Europe's biggest producer of aluminium extrusions while Sumitomo is
a leading supplier to the Japanese vehicle industry. Similar links have been
established by companies reacting to forecasts of a surge in the use of
aluminium in cars and other vehicles to reduce weight and pollution.
