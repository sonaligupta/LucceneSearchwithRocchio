FT  06 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Hochtief to build new airport for Athens

   BONN, ATHENS


HOCHTIEF, one of Germany's largest construction companies, has won a DM4bn
(Dollars 2.3bn) contract from the Greek government to build and run a new
airport at Spata 16 miles from Athens.
The airport is intended to serve as the regional hub for southeast Europe.
The Greek government says it will replace the existing airport in Athens,
which has been criticised by local residents for its high level of noise
pollution.
Under the terms of the deal, the airport will be operated for 50 years by a
company owned 40 per cent by the Greek state and 60 per cent by a
Hochtief-led consortium.
The latter includes Asea Brown Boveri-Germany from the Swiss-Scandinavian
group, Krantz TKT, a subsidiary of the Deutsche Babcock engineering group,
and Flughafen Frankfurt Main company, which runs Frankfurt airport. The
principal Greek subcontractor will be Mechaniki, a northern Greek
construction concern.
The Greek partner will provide 35 per cent of the financing through an
Ecu400m (Dollars 452m) grant from the European Community and is raising the
remainder of its contribution through an airport transit tax.
The controversial tax was imposed earlier this year on passengers using
existing Greek airports.
The German side will contribute the rest of the financing. Hochtief said its
initial capital commitment would be Ecu180m.
The construction is expected to take 51 months and the airport is due to be
operational in 1998.
The German companies won the contract after being short-listed with a
French-Greek consortium led by Societe Auxilliaire d'Entreprises de France
and Aeroport de Paris.
Hochtief said the key factor in winning the contract was the willingness of
the German consortium to allow the Greek state a larger equity stake in the
airport company.
