FT  27 MAY 93 / Observer: Enarques parked


The snooty Enarquy - students of the Ecole Nationale d'Administration,
France's equivalent of the Ivy League and Oxbridge combined - never did like
short-lived prime minister Edith Cresson's idea of banishing them from their
leafy Paris headquarters to Strasbourg.
The Cresson plan, ostensibly part of the Socialists' decentralisation
programme to move public institutions to the provinces, was always seen as a
thinly disguised affront to the ENA whose products abound in political high
places.
But the Enarques have battled back. Only two months after the Socialists
lost power, a government commission has asked for the Cresson edict to be
dropped. The matter has now been passed on to a Paris magistrate's court
which will have the final decision on whether ENA can stay parked in the
capital.
No prizes for guessing the outcome now.
