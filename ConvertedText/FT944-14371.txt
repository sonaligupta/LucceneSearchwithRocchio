FT  24 OCT 94 / Italian airports face disruption

Industrial action by Italian airline pilots, customs officials, air traffic
controllers, technicians, and ground and cabin staff threatens to disrupt
arrivals and departures at Italian airports this week, particularly today,
tomorrow and on Wednesday.
The protests are not co-ordinated and have been called for various reasons.
Under emergency rules, certain flights are guaranteed, including many
intercontinental flights arriving in Italy. Alitalia has specifically warned
of flight cancellations and delays between 10am and 6pm on Wednesday because
of a strike by cabin staff and air traffic controllers.
Some workers are protesting against the Italian government's budget plans,
some against new contract proposals, and others against the planned merger
between Alitalia and its domestic subsidiary, Ati. Last Friday, eight out of
10 Ati pilots reported sick, forcing cancellation of 113 mainly domestic
flights. The pilots, most of whom were back at work by yesterday, object to
the Alitalia-Ati merger, which they claim will hinder promotion. They plan
an official strike on Friday.
