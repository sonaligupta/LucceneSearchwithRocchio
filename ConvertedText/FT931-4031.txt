FT  12 MAR 93 / International Company News: Bayer posts 16% drop to DM2.7bn
for year


   By DAVID WALLER


   FRANKFURT


BAYER, the least recession-prone of the big three German chemicals groups,
yesterday reported pre-tax profits down by 16 per cent to DM2.7bn (Dollars
1.62bn) for last year from DM3.2bn in 1991. Sales for the year dropped 2.8
per cent to DM41.2bn
The dividend for the year will be cut to DM11 per share from DM13 - the
first time the company has cut its dividend in a decade.
The figures were in line with analysts' expectations and highlight Bayer's
resilience amid the current severe downturn in the European chemicals
industry, especially when compared to fellow German chemicals companies
Hoechst and BASF.
Earlier this week, BASF cut its dividend by DM2 to DM10 per share and
reported pre-tax profits down by 41 per cent to DM1.24bn. Hoechst cut its
dividend by DM3 to DM9 per share and reported pre-tax profits down 17.7 per
cent to DM2.1bn.
A detailed breakdown of last year's figures will come at next week's press
conference, but analysts said that the Bayer's resilience last year
reflected its relatively small exposure to the badly-hit petrochemicals and
plastics areas of the chemicals industry, and the high proportion of sales
and profits coming from health care.
Pharmaceuticals contributed DM1.74bn to Bayer's DM3.2bn operating profits in
1991, more than at the other two large chemicals companies in absolute and
relative terms.
Analysts said that Bayer could have afforded not to have cut its dividend
for last year. They estimated that its dividend was twice covered by
earnings, while at BASF the dividend is likely to absorb 95 per cent of
earnings.
Last year, it held its dividend while the other two chemicals companies cut
theirs. Analysts expected this year's cut in the light of the general
economic downturn in Germany.
