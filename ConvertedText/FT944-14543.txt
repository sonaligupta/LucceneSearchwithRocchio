FT  22 OCT 94 / Ministry allows cattle flights


The agriculture ministry yesterday gave its approval for live calves to be
flown from Humberside to Rotterdam to get around a ban imposed by ferry
companies on the shipment of live animals to Europe. Animal welfare groups
have protested against the flights of up to 200 calves in unpressurised
aircraft.
