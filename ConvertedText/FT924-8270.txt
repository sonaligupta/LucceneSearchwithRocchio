FT  12 NOV 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report


   By REUTER


London ROBUSTA coffee futures, after several days of retracement, extended
early gains in a late rally thought to be caused by fresh speculator buying.
The January position ended the day Dollars 29 up at Dollars 937 a tonne. The
advance may have been encouraged by new that Brazilian October coffee
exports were 810,000 tonnes lower than in the same month last year at 1.36m
bags (60 kg each). COCOA prices surrendered some of the previous day's gains
as dealers said the market was consolidating after recently reaching
nine-month highs. They noted light industry buying but said producers were
mostly sidelined, although there had been small West African sales in nearby
months. GOLD and SILVER prices steadied following Tuesday's sharp setbacks,
which traders said had left gold heavily oversold. At the London Metal
Exchange COPPER prices edged higher following Tuesday's rally, but early
gains in the NICKEL market were wiped out by merchant selling. The ZINC
market, lacking follow-through after an early rally, closed virtually
unchanged.
