FT  24 AUG 92 / International Company News: Rothschild stays quiet over
loans


   By IAN RODGER


   ZURICH


SIR EVELYN de Rothschild, chairman of NM Rothschild & Sons of London, and
lawyers for Rothschild Bank in Zurich were unavailable for comment Friday
and yesterday on reports that the Zurich bank had made loans to a single
client above the level permitted by the Swiss Banking Commission.
According to reports in Swiss media, the loans were made to the troubled
York Hannover property group led by the Canadian-German financier, Mr
Karsten von Wersebe.
RBZ, which is an associate company of NMR, early this month sacked one of
its top executives, Mr Jurg Heer, after he was arrested for 'irregularities'
which are understood to centre around making large unauthorised loans.
Last month, the bank revealed that a recent credit review had found that
some loans were not fully covered and so it proposed to quadruple its annual
provisions in the year to March 31, 1992 to SFr99.8m (Dollars 75.6m) and to
dissolve its SFr63.5m in hidden reserves 'as a safety measure'. According to
reports in Zurich, the bank's actual total of bad loans may be considerably
larger than these figures indicate.
Such loans and provisions are unusual in a bank whose main activity is
managing funds for rich individuals in return for fees. As a rule, these
funds are invested in very conservative instruments, with a view to
protecting clients' capital by avoiding unnecessary risk.
