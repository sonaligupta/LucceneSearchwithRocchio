FT  13 NOV 92 / Observer: Roughing up


Which is worse, being mugged on Rio's Copacabana beach or sailing the next
8,800 mile leg of the British Steel round-the-world yacht race?
At least Adrian Donovan, the 34-year-old skipper of Heath Insured, has had
first-hand experience of the first. Four local lads carrying knives
attempted to relieve the gentle giant of the sea of his wallet while he was
out training the other day. Fortunately the six foot three Donovan, who
shouts like Hornblower, did not have to make a claim on his C E Heath
insurance policy and the muggers came off worse.
Let's hope that Donovan and his crew, who are definitely first division
racing material, fare as well over the next couple of months on the Hobart
leg of the race. The FT's top yachtie, for one, is glad that he doesn't have
to sail it.
