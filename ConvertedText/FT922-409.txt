FT  27 JUN 92 / Gummer accuses French crews


   By BETHAN HUTTON


MR JOHN GUMMER, the agriculture minister, accused French trawlermen of
stirring up '1,000 years of rivalry and hatred' in the row over fishing
rights around the Scilly Isles, Bethan Hutton writes.
He presented Mr Louis Mermaz, the French agriculture minister, with a
preliminary report of the incident on Thursday in which French trawler crews
allegedly cut the nets of British boats. The report will be passed to Mr
Charles Josselin, the French fisheries minister.
Mr Gummer said he expected 'immediate and very tough action', but both sides
emphasised that the incident would not be allowed to affect friendly
relations between the two countries.
