FT  28 APR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Zinc and nickel make late gains at
the LME - Market report


   By REUTER


Base metals ended the day trading in recent well-established ranges with the
closure of the New York Commodity Exchange stifling activity in the COPPER
market. But zinc and nickel prices moved higher as buying picked up in the
after hours 'kerb' session.
ALUMINIUM weathered Chinese selling to maintain early gains reflecting
speculative buying and short-covering. Last business for the three months
delivery position was at Dollars 1,296.50 a tonne, up Dollars 10.50.
Three months ZINC recovered from a low of Dollars 932 a tonne on the back of
late brisk commission house buying and short-covering. It closed at Dollars
945, up Dollars 9 from Tuesday.
NICKEL, after finding support at Dollars 5,300 a tonne for three months
delivery, moved higher in late trading amid European trade buying to end at
Dollars 5,365, a gain of Dollars 35.
Trading was very slow on the precious metal markets after a featureless
options expiry.
GOLD fixed at Dollars 374.25 a troy ounce, just 10 cents down on the morning
setting and 5 cents below the Tuesday afternoon fixing. 'Everything has come
off a bit. There is very little business going on,' one dealer said.
Gold had gained some early support from the rather fraught start to polling
in South Africa and was marked up a couple of ticks after news of the bomb
at Johannesburg airport, dealers said.
SILVER was quiet all day and slipped to a cent under the Dollars
5.17-Dollars 5.19 opening by mid-afternoon after gaining a couple of cents
earlier.
