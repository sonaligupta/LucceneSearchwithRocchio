FT  22 OCT 94 / UK Company News: NatWest signs Mondex cash card deal with
Hongkong Bank


   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor


National Westminster Bank has made the first step in its attempt to
establish global usage for its Mondex electronic cash card by selling the
rights to franchise the card in several Asian countries to Hongkong &
Shanghai Banking Corporation.
NatWest is also in talks with banks in Germany, France and the US to sell
the rights to franchise and develop the use of the card in those countries.
In return it is offering them equity stakes in a new company that will
control Mondex, in which NatWest will have a golden share.
NatWest is planning to test the card - which can be loaded by consumers with
electronic cash units and used in shops to pay for goods and services - in
Swindon next year. The British rights are held by NatWest in partnership
with Midland Bank and British Telecom.
Hongkong Bank, which is a subsidiary of HSBC Holdings, has acquired the
rights to franchise the card in Hong Kong, China, India, Indonesia, Macau,
the Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Taiwan and Thailand. Hongkong Bank
Malaysia will have rights in Malaysia.
Mr Bert Morris, deputy chief executive of NatWest, said that the bank was in
talks with about 30 banks in 115 countries.
Mr Morris said he believed NatWest would be able to charge UK consumers for
the use of the card. 'We have not taken any decision, as my inclination
would be not to give it away. The banking industry has given far too many
things away.'
He said the agreement gave Hongkong Bank exclusive rights until 2005, but
that NatWest was talking to other banks in south-east Asia.
NatWest wants to establish Mondex as the worldwide standard for cash cards.
It uses a microchip to store cash units, and can be loaded at home with an
adapted telephone.
