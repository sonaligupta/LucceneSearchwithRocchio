FT  25 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Partner found for Richmond venture


Richmond Oil & Gas, the struggling natural resources company which lost its
main asset to creditors last year, has found an investment partner for its
Siberian joint venture.
Northstar Energy, a Canadian company, has agreed to pay Dollars 1.15m
(Pounds 740,000) for 85 per cent of Richmond Russia, the sole asset of which
is a 39 per cent interest in Taloil, a joint venture with Krasnoleninsk Oil
and Gas.
Northstar has also agreed to find Dollars 18.5m in financing to equip the
joint venture, and will procure funds in excess of Dollars 50m to meet the
project's foreign capital requirements.
Richmond has been struggling to find financing for the joint venture since
the company hit problems selling its coal bed methane interests. Last year's
accounts were qualified, with accountants Touche Ross saying that Richmond's
ability to continue trading would depend on disposals.
