FT  15 NOV 93 / Observer: Decision time


Still on the subject of possible boardroom rifts at the top of big FT-SE 100
companies, some old Unilever-watchers are wondering why it is taking so long
for the Anglo-Dutch multinational to make up its mind about its next
boardroom reshuffle.
Unilever is headed by a triumvirate consisting of two chairmen - one English
and one Dutch - and a third director, currently Morris Tabaksblat, 56. The
latter is expected to replace Floris Maljers as chairman of Unilever NV when
he retires next year. This will leave a slot on the committee which by
tradition is filled by the next British chairman in waiting. Michael Perry,
the current chairman, is only three years off retirement so whoever gets the
seat on the special committee should not have long to wait until assuming
the chairmanship.
The front-runners for the job are Niall FitzGerald, 48, and Charles Miller
Smith, 54. The latter may have blotted his copybook by his reported interest
in the chief executive's job at Barclays. On the other hand if FitzGerald
were to get the job he would might be in charge of Unilever for an awfully
long time. The smart money is on FitzGerald but don't rule out the chance of
another caretaker being appointed to the committee.
