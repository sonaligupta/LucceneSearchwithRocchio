FT  24 OCT 94 / Intel wins injunction over clone

   SAN FRANCISCO


Intel, the world's largest semiconductor manufacturer, has won an injunction
forcing a halt to shipments of clones of its microprocessors made by
Advanced Micro Devices, a rival US chip maker. The court order will not take
effect, however, until mid-January by which time AMD claims that it will be
ready to ship new versions of its microprocessors with the offending
software 'microcode' expunged. The injunction follows a ruling this month
that AMD microprocessors contain 'microcode' software that infringes an
Intel copyright. The case is the latest is a decade of legal battles between
the semiconductor industry rivals.
With its Intel-compatible microprocessors, AMD has gained about 6 per cent
of the market, while Intel supplies about 90 per cent of all microprocessors
used in personal computers. AMD's largest customer is Compaq Computer, the
PC market leader. Intel said it will seek damages for all shipments of AMD's
microprocessors that contain the infringing microcode. The court has yet to
rule on damages. The judge has, however, effectively given AMD a reprieve by
allowing the chip maker to meet orders for its microprocessor chips until
January 15.
