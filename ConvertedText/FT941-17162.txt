FT  06 JAN 94 / Peace talks close to compromise


   By JULIAN OZANNE


Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation edged towards a compromise
formula for resuming peace talks yesterday but Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli
prime minister, ruled out a meeting this week.
Although both sides spoke optimistically of resuming talks next week, it is
unlikely the two sides can reach agreement on implementing Palestinian
self-rule in the Gaza strip and West Bank area of Jericho this month.
Fears for the peace accord rose this week as Mr Binyamin Netanyahu, leader
of the opposition right-wing Likud party, said he would not honour the
agreement if his party was elected to power because he considered the PLO to
have reneged on its commitments under the accord.
Mr Netanyahu's statement, which reversed an earlier commitment by Likud to
stand by the agreement, was intended to encourage opposition to the peace
accord and increase pressure on Mr Rabin to open a dialogue with Likud.
After an intense series of contacts by telephone and fax and a last minute
minor compromise by Jerusalem on the issue of borders, PLO and Israeli
officials said they were prepared to restart negotiations in the Egyptian
Red Sea resort of Taba next week.
However Mr Rabin said a final decision would only be taken today once Israel
was certain the PLO had accepted the rules and limits of negotiations.
Israeli officials said resumption of the talks was possible after the PLO
dropped several demands intended to increase the symbolic sovereignty of
Palestinian self-rule and after Israel agreed to meet one PLO demand for the
presence of Palestinian flags and policemen at the Jordanian-West Bank
border.
