FT  27 OCT 92 / Boost for Ulster exports


NORTHERN IRELAND manufacturers have become leading exporters, according to a
report published yesterday.
More than two thirds of manufactured goods - which were worth Pounds 4.13bn
in 1990 - were sold outside Ulster.
The report from the Northern Ireland Economic Research Centre said the
largest single market for Ulster-based companies was Great Britain, which
accounted for Pounds 2,046m of sales.
