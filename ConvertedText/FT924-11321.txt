FT  27 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Dumas


The planned reconstruction of Dumas Group, involving the acquisition of a
substantial private company, has fallen through.
The importer and distributor of speciality foods has therefore re-activated
earlier discussions under which a group of private investors would take part
in a financial and managerial reorganisation.
A basis has been agreed for recommending proposals to shareholders of the
USM-quoted company and a circular is expected shortly.
