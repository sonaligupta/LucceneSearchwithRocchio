FT  03 AUG 92 / Olympic News In Brief: Win vital for UK hockey team


It is win or burst time for Britain in defence of their Olympic men's hockey
crown. They need victory over Australia in their final group match today to
secure a semi-final place.
Their 2-1 win over Argentina, courtesy of two first-half goals by Rob Hill,
kept the British defence alive - but Australia are much tougher. They came
into the tournament as one of the favourites and are unbeaten in their four
group A matches. The UK women reached their sem-finals, beating New Zealand.
