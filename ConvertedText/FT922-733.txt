FT  26 JUN 92 / Midland may buy Peru bank


   By SALLY BOWEN


   LIMA


MIDLAND Bank of the UK is considering buying a loss-making state-owned bank
in Peru, writes Sally Bowen in Lima.
The bank's senior Latin American executive, Mr Marcos Brujis, arrived in
Lima this week for negotiations with government officials over the purchase
of Banco Popular.
This, one of the oldest and most extensive of Peru's banking networks, has
deep financial troubles. Its bad-loans portfolio is about the equivalent of
Dollars 55m and securitised debts to foreign banks Dollars 76m.
Midland would commit itself to bring in credit lines for Dollars 10m-Dollars
14m, and to guarantee another Dollars 10m or so in credit from a
multilateral financial institution such as the Andean Development
Corporation.
The purchase would be made largely through an exchange of short-term debt
for equity in the bank. Midland still holds some Dollars 24m in Peruvian
short-term debt.
Midland is expected to insist that the Peruvian government assume Banco
Popular's bad-loans portfolio.
