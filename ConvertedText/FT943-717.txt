FT  28 SEP 94 / Scottish ferry line sell-off 'rejected'


   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent


The government is believed to have rejected the idea of privatising the
shipping line Caledonian MacBrayne, which operates ferries on Scotland's
west coast.
The decision, to be announced in the next few weeks, follows a study of
CalMac by KPMG Management Consulting, which examined a range of options for
private-sector participation in the running of the services, including
privatisation.
The decision to review CalMac's operations only a few years after a study in
1988 rejected privatisation produced strong protests in the Western Isles
and along the west coast, with islanders fearing that the services would be
cut or stopped. It is believed that the holding of a review was insisted on
by the Treasury.
CalMac argued strongly to be left intact and retain its structure, which
involves a small number of profitable routes helping to subsidise the larger
number of loss-making ones, and requiring a Scottish Office grant which last
year was Pounds 6m.
KPMG is widely believed to have recommended against privatisation and the
government is thought to have accepted that. It may make some
recommendations on improved efficiency.
The Scottish Office refused to comment on suggestions that CalMac was not to
be privatised. Mr Colin Paterson, CalMac managing director, said: 'I haven't
had any official confirmation, but if the leak is true I'm absolutely
delighted for the company, staff and islanders.'
