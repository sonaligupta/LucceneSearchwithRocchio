FT  27 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Casket advances to Pounds 2.85m


   By CATHERINE MILTON


CASKET, which is to make bicycles similar to the high-tech Lotus on which
Chris Boardman won an Olympic medal last summer, clocked up pre-tax profits
of Pounds 2.85m in the year to March 31 on the back of a big jump in cycle
sales.
This was a sharp rise from Pounds 341,000, but the comparison was flattered
under FRS 3 accounting rules by Pounds 1.72m in provisions made in the
previous year for operations.
Mr Joe Smith, chief executive, said: 'We must remain cautious while the
recovery is still patchy, but we are optimistic about the outlook for
Casket.'
The Boardman-inspired bike, using licenced elements of the Lotus design and
retailing for about Pounds 3,000, has yet to enter production, but Casket
has already launched five conventional models under its new LotusSport
brand. The brand is Casket's in perpetuity, subject to minimum sales of 'a
few thousand cycles' a year, the company said .
Casket now has nine brands, including famous names such as Falcon and
British Eagle, and about 250 models. UK production accounts for a third of
the total and is expected to climb to half this year.
Casket claims 25 per cent of the UK cycle market and is not looking for
'further dramatic increases,' aiming to increase sales in continental
Europe. Cycle exports are now 10 per cent.
Turnover in the year under review rose to Pounds 96.5m (Pounds 71.9m). Sales
of cycles rose by 70 per cent to Pounds 52.2m (Pounds 30.7m) some 600,000
(420,000) cycles, which gave operating profits of Pounds 3.99m (Pounds
2.25m).
The clothing division, reorganised after the acquisition of Yates in
September, lifted sales 12 per cent to Pounds 44.3m (Pounds 39.5m), giving
operating profits of Pounds 806,000 (Pounds 1.23m).
Casket sells most of its largely overseas-sourced clothes under the 'own
labels' of high-street retailers and reported margin pressure as buyers
tried to hold prices in spite of sterling's devaluation.
Net interest payments fell to Pounds 1.48m (Pounds 1.75m). Borrowings were
reduced to Pounds 4.17m (Pounds 5.6m) and gearing fell to 31 per cent (46
per cent). Net cash of Pounds 1.43m was generated.
The recommended final dividend of 0.5p (0.35p) gives a total of 0.8p (0.5p).
Earnings per share were 2.53p (0.12p).
