FT  24 NOV 92 / Dan-Air takeover probe rejected


VIRGIN Atlantic and British Midland failed yesterday in their High Court
attempt to have the British Airways takeover of Dan-Air referred to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
The two airlines were refused leave for a judicial review of the
government's decision not to refer the takeover to the MMC. They had argued
that the EC treaty required the MMC and Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and
industry secretary, to examine the takeover under rules prohibiting abuse of
a dominant trading position.
