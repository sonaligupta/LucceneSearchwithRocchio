sector rival SAE

FOUGEROLLE, the French construction company, has mounted an offer for one of
its chief competitors, Societe Auxiliare d'Entreprises in a deal which
values SAE at FFr4.6bn (Dollars 836m).
If the bid succeeds, it will create a major force in the French building
industry - with an overall annual turnover of FFr40bn - to compete against
France's construction groups such as Bouygues.
Fougerolle is offering an immediate payment of FFr1,100 for each SAE share,
or FFr1,200 a share payable in one year's time. SAE's shares, which were
suspended yesterday, closed on Monday at FFr920.
Fougerolle already owns 22.8 per cent of SAE and will have to pay up to
FFr3.5bn to take control of all the remaining shares. The acquisition will
be financed by an increase in the capital of Financiere Fougerolle, its
holding company, and by bank debt.
Paribas, the prominent French bank, has already agreed to sell its 5.2 per
cent stake in SAE to Fougerolle. Paribas also owns 47 per cent of Financiere
Fougerolle.
Another of SAE's minority shareholders, Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez, the water
and construction group, has undertaken to sell its 4.5 per cent holding to
Fougerolle.
Fougerolle also yesterday predicted a 20 per cent increase in its
consolidated net profits for 1991 to FFr400m, against FFr335m in 1990. It
also anticipates a 6 per cent rise in consolidated sales to FFr12.5bn for
the year.
Bouygues, France's biggest construction group, forecast a 5 per cent
increase in net profits from FFr626m in 1990 to FFr660m in 1991. This
estimate does not include a provision related to Bouygues' work on the
Channel tunnel.
