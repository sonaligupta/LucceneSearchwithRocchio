FT  26 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Lower bad debt charge boosts TSB


   By DAVID BARCHARD


A SHARP REDUCTION in the bad debt charge and tight control over costs
enabled TSB Group, the UK's sixth largest banking group, to report pre-tax
profits of Pounds 92m for six months to April 30, compared with losses of
Pounds 150m.
Sir Nicholas Goodison, chairman, said the results were not surprising but
showed the bank was reaping the rewards of its restructuring operations
since the late 1980s. Profits in the second half of the previous year left
full-year losses at Pounds 47m.
'The TSB group is now in much better shape after the hard work of the last
three years,' Sir Nicholas said, announcing that the interim dividend would
be maintained at 3.15p.
TSB's comparative interim loss was incurred after bad debt provisions of
Pounds 422m, following problems in the corporate lending book of Hill
Samuel, its merchant bank subsidiary, which accounted for Pounds 346m. This
time the total charge was Pounds 165m of which Hill Samuel accounted for
Pounds 46m.
The fall enabled the merchant bank to cut its loss from Pounds 324m to
Pounds 54m.
This year's group provision included a Pounds 37m charge for losses at
Mortgage Express, the mortgage company shut down last year. Without this the
provisions for losses in retail banking would have been flat.
Although the result was relatively encouraging when compared with last
year's losses, TSB's operating profit was down from Pounds 272m to Pounds
257m.
City analysts said the results were in line with expectations and suggested
that TSB's core retail banking businesses were faring reasonably well in
spite of poor market conditions.
The recession was blamed for a fall in profits at the group's principal
businesses. TSB Retail Banking made Pounds 121m, down from Pounds 128m, and
TSB Insurance made Pounds 49m, down from Pounds 58m.
Mr Don McCrickard, group chief executive, said TSB was trying to build up
its retail deposit base by improving its deposit account products. During
the half year, it picked up Pounds 1.4bn of higher interest deposits.
TSB has shrunk slightly in size because of the recession and its loan
business is marking time because of slack demand.
Total assets at April 30 were Pounds 25.6bn down from Pounds 27.3bn a year
ago. Net interest income was barely changed at Pounds 487m (Pounds 489m)
while other income rose from Pounds 400m to Pounds 434m.
Although the group's cost income ratio has risen to 72.1 per cent (70.5 per
cent) total operating costs fell from Pounds 658m to Pounds 649m.
Its risk asset ratio has risen from 10.6 per cent in April last year to 12.6
per cent.
Net assets per share at the end of the period were up from 109p to 114p.
Earnings per share were 3.87p, compared with losses of 7.7p.
