FT  25 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Epwin moves ahead with 7% advance to Pounds
1.31m


   By PETER PEARSE


EPWIN GROUP, the maker of PVC-u windows and doors, 'is a business with
stamina', said Mr Jim Rawson, chairman, as he revealed a 7 per cent increase
in pre-tax profits for the first half of 1992.
Profits of Pounds 1.31m (Pounds 1.23m) were struck on turnover 4 per cent up
at Pounds 20.5m (Pounds 19.7m), though last time's pre-tax line included a
Pounds 200,000 provision to cover the design, marketing and development
costs of a new window for sale to the new build market.
Currently this market accounts for almost no turnover at Epwin and Mr Rawson
said the company 'had gone out on a bit of a limb financially' with the new
product. However, he added that two of the top 10 house builders were giving
it trials.
The profits rise was spread across the group's other two markets  - home
improvements and the public sector  - which account for 80 and 20 per cent
of turnover respectively.
Mr Rawson said that the latter market had had 'a good run' in the late-1980s
before the introduction of poll tax, but that 'it was now falling off a
bit'.
Plastiseal, a rival in this market, went into receivership last week.
In home improvements, the group gained market share and held its prices. In
March, it moved up to the main market and launched a successful Pounds 5.4m
rights issue to fund the initial tranche of the Pounds 9.9m planned capital
expenditure for 1992-93.
Mr Rawson said that there was no recovery forecast for 1992 and that in
value terms the market fell 14 per cent in 1991.
The interim dividend is held at 2.1p, payable from earnings per share
slightly lower at 5p (5.2p) reflecting the increased capital.
