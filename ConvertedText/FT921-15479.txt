FT  10 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Appeal for acceptance of Uruguay Round
drafts


   By FRANCES WILLIAMS


   GENEVA


MR Arthur Dunkel, Gatt's director-general, has urged governments taking part
in the Uruguay Round negotiations to accept his draft package of accords as
a basis for continuing talks, leaving open the possibility that some aspects
be reopened.
The 108 countries involved are due to give their reactions to the package,
finalised on December 20, at a meeting of the top-level Trade Negotiations
Committee next Monday
Alarmed that objections to the agriculture deal could open the floodgates to
every country dissatisfied with this or that proposal, Mr Dunkel yesterday
summoned senior officials from the main trading nations to urge provisional
acceptance of the draft package and to set a timetable for further talks
designed to conclude the Round by April 15.
It was always envisaged that once the draft package was agreed there would
need to be some weeks of detailed bilateral negotiations on market-opening
measures for both goods and services, as well as some 'fine-tuning' of the
legal language. These bilateral deals, 'multilateralised' by Gatt's
non-discriminatory most-favoured nation rule, will be an integral part of
the final Uruguay Round accord.
Unless EC ministers change tack when they meet in Brussels today and
tomorrow, the Community looks set to demand renegotiation at least of that
part of the package dealing with farmers' compensation payments. Mr Dunkel's
concern will be to create scope for a limited number of changes necessary to
bring all participants on board.
