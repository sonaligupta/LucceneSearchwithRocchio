FT  29 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: India tries to crack its cashew
nut problem - Development of processing capacity has far outstripped output


   By KUNAL BOSE


India, the world's biggest producer and exporter of cashew nuts, has earned
nearly Rs10bn (Pounds 210m) from the export of 60,000 tonnes during the year
to March 1994, up from Rs7.45bn in 1993-94, when the amount exported was
53,241 tonnes.
However, the country last year had to import nearly 10,000 tonnes of raw
cashews for processing and re-export.
Because of the lack of co-ordinated planning cashew processing capacity has
run well ahead of requirements. There are now 677 factories, mostly in the
southern parts of the country, which together could handle over 650,000
tonnes of nuts a year. But annual domestic production of raw nuts is only
about 350,000 tonnes.
As is the case with so many other crops, cashew productivity in India lags
behind the competition - at less than 650kg a hectare, compared with over
1,000kg in other major producing countries.
India has about 540,000 hectares under cashews, most of it in the coastal
areas, and according to the National Commission on Agriculture, it should be
able to produce 700,000 tonnes of raw nuts by the year 2000.
Experts do not, however, accept the commission's contention that it should
be possible to produce this amount from 350,000 hectares by raising
productivity to 2,000kg a hectare. They maintain that achieving the turn of
the century production target would require both productivity improvement
and the devotion of more land to the crop.
The most important initiative to be taken for improving productivity is the
encouragement of the cultivation of clonal materials from high yielding
varieties. The National Research Centre for Cashew has developed nearly 30
such varieties and in some areas of Maharashtra where their use has been
combined with efficient horticulture practices yields of up to 1,300kg a
hectare have been achieved.
The setting up of 40 regional nurseries in the first phase will go a long
way towards meeting the demand for high quality planting material.
Scientists say state authorities must ban the use of low-yielding,
low-quality seedlings.
Though cashew is a highly resilient crop that withstands drought,
supplementary irrigation during the flowering and fruiting period gives a
useful boost to productivity. Similarly, the use of fertilisers,
particularly nitrogen, leads to a higher cashew yield. Supplementary
irrigation and use of fertilisers need to be promoted through farm extension
programmes, according to the experts.
While many trees in the traditional growing areas need immediate
replacement, the crop is becoming increasingly popular in new centres like
Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat. And more and more farmers are being drawn to
cashew nuts as inter-cropping with pineapple, groundnut and coconut has
proved successful.
