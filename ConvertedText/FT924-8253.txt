FT  12 NOV 92 / International Company News: Tiger Oats shrugs off poor
trading conditions


   By PHILIP GAWITH


TIGER Oats, the food manufacturer in the South African Barlow Rand group,
overcame difficult trading conditions to record a 16 per cent increase in
attributable earnings to R335m (Dollars 111.6m) for the 12 months to
September from R289m for the year before.
Turnover rose by 15 per cent to R9.2bn from R7.98bn, and operating profits
advanced 13 per cent to R677m from R598m. Owing to the larger number of
shares in issue, earnings per share were only 11 per cent up, at 230 cents
against 207 cents. The dividend is being lifted by a similar amount to 79
cents per share from 71 cents.
Mr Robbie Williams, chairman, said the depth of the recession was evident
from the fact that there were declines in volume terms of nearly half of the
grocery categories measured in South Africa's leading retailers.
He said, however, that volumes in basic foodstuffs had held up and Tiger
Oats had been able to increase its market share.
Mr Williams said there had been real growth in turnover across all the main
areas of Tiger Foods.
Referring to other group activities, he said pharmaceutical companies Adcock
Ingram and Logos had been helped by new products to perform well. Oceana,
the fishing group, also achieved good results following increased landings
of fish.
Mr Williams said short-term prospects 'do not look at all promising', but
said Tiger Oats was expecting an improvement in the year ahead, although
this could be weighted towards the second half of 1993.
Rand Mines, the mining arm of the Barlow Rand group which was split into
four businesses at the beginning of October, reported a 4 per cent fall in
earnings from continuing operations to R173.4m in the year to September from
R181.1m.
