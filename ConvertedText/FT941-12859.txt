   WASHINGTON


New orders for US durable goods rose 2.2 per cent in December compared with
the previous month, providing further confirmation of the surge in economic
activity at the end of last year, official figures indicated yesterday,
writes Michael Prowse in Washington.
Orders rose 8.6 per cent during 1993 as a whole, the largest increase for
five years. The figures were the latest in a series of buoyant statistics
indicating the US recovery is gaining significant momentum. Most analysts
expect gross domestic product data due today to show growth at an annual
rate of about 6 per cent in the final quarter of last year.
Orders rose in all main industrial sectors with the largest gains registered
in capital goods, mainly electronics and electrical machinery. Excluding
defence, orders rose 1.8 per cent from November.
