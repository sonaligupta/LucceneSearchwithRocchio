FT  25 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Cold and dark - Ballot Box


Many candidates are fondly recalling the days of Mrs Thatcher when elections
were held in late spring or early summer. Today the cold is a factor.
Andrew Pearce, the former Euro-MP trying to hold Ellesmere Port and Neston
for the Tories, is struggling on in a dark blue suit without an overcoat to
try to project the right image. One pensioner recoiled two feet, startled as
he shook Pearce's frozen hand.
'It's like doctors examining patients. You shouldn't do it with cold hands
in case you make them jump,' Pearce said.
He is developing a technique of running between front doors to keep his
circulation going, with his right hand thrust inside his trouser pocket to
soften its impact on unsuspecting voters.
Then there is the dark. Lynda Chalker recalls that she was once dragged
inside a house by a man when canvassing alone in London in her youth. 'I
used my knee and nails and fought my way out.' Now she has a man with her
when canvassing at night. But many people will not open their front doors to
anyone much after 8pm.
Like most candidates, she is looking forward to summertime to begin at the
weekend. Then, of course, the weather could change for the worse. There has
not been much snow so far.
