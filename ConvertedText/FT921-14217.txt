FT  17 JAN 92 / Change urged in Irish accounting


   By TIM COONE

SIGNIFICANT changes in the accounting practices of publicly-quoted companies
in Ireland have been recommended in a report published yesterday by the
Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland (ICAI).
The report says Irish accounting practices should be brought into line with
those in the UK, as established under the Accounting Standards Board there
in 1989.
It said that under the existing system, 'many published financial statements
do not at present provide enough information to enable users to judge the
performance of directors and management and make decisions about their
future relationships with the reporting company.'
The report recommends that 'all companies should be required by law to
include a statement in their annual report of directors' responsibilities in
relation to the financial statements' and that audit committees should be
established by reporting companies to ensure that their financial statements
'fully comply with company law, accounting standards and best practice, that
they make adequate disclosure, that they are comprehensible and consistent
and comparable with previous statements and disclosures'.
The IACI recommends that a Financial Reporting Review Panel should be
established 'as a body responsible for examining material departures from
accounting standards'.
