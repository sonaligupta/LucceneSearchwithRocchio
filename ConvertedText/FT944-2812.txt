FT  15 DEC 94 / International Company News: Hungary agrees to sell hotels
stake

Hungary's privatisation authorities yesterday backed down and agreed to sell
a 51 per cent stake in the country's last state-owned hotel chain to
American General Hospitality, a privately-held US hotel management group.
AGH won the right to negotiate for HungarHotels last month but talks broke
down between the company and the privatisation body after a last-minute
price increase and political pressure to hand over the group to the
cash-strapped social security fund.
The deal, which is due to be signed by mid-January, is only the second large
privatisation to have come up since the new socialist-led government took
office in July and has been viewed as a indication of the new
administration's commitment to privatisation.
The State Property Agency agreed to sell 51 per cent of the chain minus one
hotel for Dollars 57.5m, AGH's original bid for the whole 15-hotel group.
The remaining hotel, which has a book value of Dollars 9m, is to be sold off
with the proceeds going to the SPA, Mr Ferenc Bartha, government
privatisation commissioner said. He said AGH had agreed to invest Dollars
19.5m in the chain over the next three years and not to sell off any of the
hotels during that time. The SPA's remaining 31 per cent stake would be
floated on the Budapest stock exchange.
