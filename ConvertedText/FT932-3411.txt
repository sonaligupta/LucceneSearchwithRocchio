TAYLOR WOODROW DESIGN BUILD is making a name for itself in the frozen and
chilled distribution centre/warehouse market with three contracts worth over
Pounds 30m in total.
The latest, for Iceland Frozen Foods, is the construction of an

Situated on 20 acres of former British Rail land on the west side of
Swindon, off the Wootton Bassett Road, the centre will be divided into
sections for frozen, chilled and ambient storage.
At Minworth in Birmingham, Taylor Woodrow Design Build is undertaking the
design and construction of Cadbury's new automated chilled storage

Covering over 35,000 sq metres the warehouse will accommodate 15 km of
racking standing 15 metres high and be split into three units.
Taylor Woodrow Design Build's third contract was the recently completed
fruit terminal at Southampton Docks.
Constructed for Associated British Ports and used by Geest, the new terminal
covers 9,500 sq metres and has storage facilities capable of holding 27m
