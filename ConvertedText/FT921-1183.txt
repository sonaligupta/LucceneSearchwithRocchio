FT  25 MAR 92 / Japan to increase share of car market


   By KEVIN DONE


JAPANESE carmakers are forecast to increase their share of the UK new car
market to 18 per cent by the end of the decade from 11.8 per cent in 1990,
Kevin Done writes.
According to a report published by Euromotor, part of the the UK-based
Ludvigsen automotive analysts, Ford - the present market leader - will be
the main loser in the UK during the 1990s. The study forecasts that Ford's
share of the UK new car market, which is already under heavy pressure, will
decline to only 21 per cent by 1999 from 25.8 per cent in 1990.
In an overall UK market which is expected to grow to some 2.5m in 1999 from
2.0m in 1990 and 1.6m in 1991, the report suggests that Japanese new car
sales will jump to 450,000 in 1999 from 236,000 in 1990. The report suggests
that Japanese carmakers will have established a total production capacity in
west Europe for 1.19m cars by 1999, most of which will be located in the UK.
