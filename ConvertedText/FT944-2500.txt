Mr Vassilis Sevdalis, the head of Greece's privatisation agency, has been
suspended following allegations of a conflict of interest in the sale of
Piraiki-Patraiki, once Greece's biggest textile company, to a group of Greek
and Saudi investors. A judicial inquiry into the disposal is under way. Mr
Sevdalis, chairman of the Organisation for Industrial Reconstruction (OAE),
an umbrella organisation for disposing of debt-burdened state enterprises,
denied any wrongdoing. But according to industry ministry officials he
admitted being a shareholder in a computer company controlled by the
Vernikos group, one of the investors in Piraiki-Patraiki.
OAE agreed last month to sell the textile concern to Evritania, a company
backed by Vernikos, Olayan of Saudi Arabia and the Katsambas-Stratos group,
its former owner. Evritania agreed to pay Dr6.8bn (Pounds 17.9m) over six
years and re-hire 1,200 workers to start up the company's biggest plant, at
Patras in western Greece. Piraiki-Patraiki shut down three years ago, with
debt totalling almost Dr70bn.
