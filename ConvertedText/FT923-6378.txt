FT  25 AUG 92 / Letter: Discounting accounting judgment


   From Mr KENNETH R WARREN


Sir, The Chartered Association of Certified Accountants published the wrong
conclusion, at a cost of Pounds 9.95 to readers of its report, that the
Select Committee on Trade and Industry 'failed to examine the expenditure
white papers and annual reports issued by the Department of Trade and
Industry' ('Whitehall papers neglected by MPs', August 21). As committee
chairman from 1983 to 1992, I can verify it did.
Why the association's researchers did not ask me I do not know. I could have
helped them achieve the accuracy accountants require of clients.
Kenneth R Warren,
Woodfield House,
