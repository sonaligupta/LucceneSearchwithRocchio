FT  20 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pechiney smelter 'breaking
even'


   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent


   DUNKIRK


PECHINEY'S new Dollars 1bn aluminium smelter at Dunkirk already is producing
at its full annual capacity rate of 215,000 tonnes and, in spite of the
seriously depressed market conditions, is breaking even financially, said Mr
Bernard Legrand, an executive vice president and head of the state-owned
groups's world wide aluminium operations, yesterday.
The smelter, brought into operation in 22 months just ahead of schedule and
slightly under budget, will produce 180,000 tonnes of aluminium this year,
account for half of France's output of the metal and confirm Pechiney's
position as the world's third largest producer.
It will boost Pechiney's total output this year by about 100,000 tonnes from
the 1991 level to 870,000 tonnes, said Mr Legrand when his group showed the
smelter to the press for the first time. Pechiney is the second largest
supplier of aluminium to the free market in the western world after Alcan of
Canada and means to retain that position.
Mr Legrand said Pechiney had turned down approaches by two European
competitors wishing to share Dunkirk's output. 'This going to be low cost
aluminium and we quickly decided we wanted it all for ourselves,' he said.
As planned, Pechiney has closed two old smelters in France and has been
forced by market conditions to curtail production at its Vlissingen smelter
in the Netherlands.
Dunkirk produces low cost aluminium partly by using high technology and
partly because it benefits from a favourable electricity supply contract
signed with Electricite de France (EDF), which is also a state-owned
company. The project originated because EDF had substantial excess nuclear
power capacity.
Pechiney has a 35 per cent shareholding in Aluminium Dunkirk, the company
which owns the Dunkirk smelter, and private investors own the rest. The
group also has a one-third share in the Dunkirk operating company with the
rest of the equity shared by the ownership company and EDF.
Pechiney is responsible for ensuring the smelter's supply of alumina - all
400,000 tonnes of this essential raw material is coming this year from
Alcoa's subsidiary in Surinam.
Mr Jean Gandois, Pechiney's chairman, said yesterday that the project showed
there was still a place for large, heavy industrial projects in Europe. The
smelter emits virtually no pollution and its productivity is claimed to be
the best in the world - 400 tonnes a year for each member of the work force
by the end of 1992. It employs 550 directly.
It also brings FFr2bn positive benefit to the French trace balance. Last
year net imports of aluminium to France rose from 405,000 tonnes in 1990 to
424,000 tonnes. Dunkirk also confirms Pechiney's leading role in aluminium
smelter technology - two thirds of all new smelters in the past 10 years
have employed its technology.
