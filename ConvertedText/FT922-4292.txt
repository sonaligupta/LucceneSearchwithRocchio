FT  06 JUN 92 / BR axes Grimsby InterCity service


   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent


FEARS THAT the privatisation of British Rail might lead to service cuts were
reinforced by the announcement yesterday that south Humberside was to lose
its InterCity link with London.
The service was one of 15 listed as vulnerable in a memorandum drawn up by a
BR employee and leaked to Mr John Prescott, the shadow transport secretary,
earlier this year. Another of the 15, the InterCity link between Shrewsbury
and the capital, was axed last month.
The service to be cut is the daily InterCity train from Cleethorpes,
Grimsby, Lincoln and Newark to London. It leaves south Humberside each
morning, returning in the evening.
British Rail said the decision had been taken for commercial reasons. The
498-seat high-speed diesel train had typically carried fewer than 100
passengers between Grimsby and the east coast main line at Newark, and could
be put to more profitable use elsewhere.
Withdrawal of the service will take effect with the introduction of the
October timetable. After that, London-bound passengers will have to take a
local train to Newark, then change.
Mr Edward Leigh, Conservative MP for Gainsborough and Horncastle, attacked
the decision as 'deplorable'. He said BR had claimed there was no threat to
the service.
Mr Prescott said he had warned this year that Tory cost-cutting and
privatisation measures would bring cuts in services. 'Sadly, my prediction
is coming true.'
Other services listed as vulnerable in the memorandum are those on the
fringes of the InterCity network such as the lines beyond Plymouth in Devon,
west of Swansea, north of Glasgow and Edinburgh, and beyond Doncaster to
Hull. Mr Prescott's constituency is Hull East.
