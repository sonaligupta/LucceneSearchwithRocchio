restructuring charge of Pounds 3.5m, compared with pre-tax profits of Pounds
4.44m the previous year. Turnover rose by 18 per cent to Pounds 60.9m.
Losses of 1.13p per share compared with earnings per share of 2.45p in 1992.
A reduced final dividend of 0.2p makes a total of 0.4p (0.45p).
Accom has 300 employees and net assets of about HKDollars 30m (Pounds 2.6m)
and is expected to make after-tax profits at least HKDollars 12.5m this year
and next. It is 68 per cent owned by Tomei, one of Hong Kong's leading
consumer electronics manufactures.
Tomei sold two small Hong Kong companies to Ross last autumn for Pounds 4m.
It will hold some 14 per cent of Ross following the deal.
