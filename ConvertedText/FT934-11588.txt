FT  30 OCT 93 / International Company News: Poland bank sale fails to
attract foreigners


   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI


   WARSAW


POLAND'S finance ministry is to cancel a tender for 45 per cent of the
equity in the state-owned Bank Slaski after failing to receive an offer from
'a satisfying investor'.
The tender, organised by Banque Paribas, aimed to produce a strategic
investor for Bank Slaski, the second big bank to be offered for sale under
Poland's bank privatisation programme.
The sale of the bank's stock, however, is to continue. Small investors are
being offered 30 per cent of the equity, starting on November 3, with the
government setting the price at 500,000 zlotys per share.
Foreign banks and domestic investors had been invited to bid for the 4.17m
of the bank's 9.26m shares, with a minimum price per share set by the
government at 230,000 zlotys.
Earlier this year, the government sold off the Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy
(WBK) with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development as its major
foreign investor. The Krakow-based Bank Przemyslowo Handlowy is next in
line.
The failure to find a large foreign partner for Bank Slaski will delay
privatisation. Even if employees and management take up their 10 per cent
allocation, and all shares offered for sale to the public are bought, a mere
40 per cent of the equity will be in private hands.
