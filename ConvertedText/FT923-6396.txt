THREE MEN were yesterday committed to the Old Bailey for trial in connection
with an alleged fraud on Eagle Star insurance company, Raymond Hughes
writes.
Mr Peter Rumball, a stockbroker with Mansion House Securities, and Mr
William Jason Butler each face a charge of conspiring with persons unknown
to defraud Eagle Star of Pounds 5.5m by the fraudulent negotiation of a
stolen share certificate representing 480,581 shares in Imperial Chemical
Industries.
Mr Anthony Lort-Phillips is charged with dishonestly handling a stolen ICI
share certificate to the value of Pounds 5.5m in that, knowing or believing
it to be stolen, he dishonestly undertook or assisted in its retention,
removal, disposal or realisation. All three were committed on bail by City
of London magistrates.
