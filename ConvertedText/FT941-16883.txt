FT  07 JAN 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Help with dates for the diary


   By DELLA BRADSHAW


Arranging a meeting between top directors within a company can be a
secretary's nightmare. The problem used to be finding the diary, but the
challenge these days is often to find the appropriate disc. A west
London-based company has developed a diary software package to make life
easier.
Timebase, from Alex Technologies, works with Windows, Windows NT, X/Windows
and Unix to store diaries centrally. When a diary is amended, a message
tells the diary owner. The package costs Pounds 30 per user. Alex
Technologies: UK, 081 566 2307.
