FT  28 MAR 92 / Briefcase, Q&A: Overtaken by events


MY HOUSE will be subject to a compulsory purchase order in the near future
as it is in the path of a motorway which is being built.
I employed a surveyor to estimate the price I will obtain. The figure was
about half of what the house is insured for. I have no desire to part with
the property and intend to remain as long as possible.
I realise that I cannot win and will eventually have to move.
I am expecting threats and demands. I intend in turn to appeal. What stages
are involved and where will I be able to direct these appeals?
The acquiring authority will serve a notice to treat on you and will then
try to come to an agreement with you over the price which ought to be paid.
If you cannot agree the question of price is referred to the Lands Tribunal,
and appeal lies from the Lands Tribunal to the Divisional Court in the
Queen's Bench Division of the High Court. An unsuccessful appeal would
involve you in having to pay the respondent's costs (as well as your own).
The value for insurance is mainly composed of the cost of rebuilding the
property. This does not necessarily coincide with the value on the market.
No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the
answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as
soon as possible.
