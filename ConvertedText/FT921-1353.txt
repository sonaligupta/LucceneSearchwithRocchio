FT  25 MAR 92 / International Company News: George Fisher tumbles to SFr42m


   By IAN RODGER


   ZURICH


GEORGE Fisher, the Swiss foundries and machinery group, suffered a 47 per
cent slump in consolidated net profit to SFr42m (Dollars 28.1m) last year,
and the directors are recommending a 20 per cent cut in the dividends,
writes Ian Rodger in Zurich.
Consolidated sales were unchanged at SFr2.5bn, but the worldwide economic
downturn put pressure on margins, the company said. The manufacturing
technology division, which produces specialised machine tools, had an
'altogether unsatisfactory result'.
An improved result is expected in 1992 even if economic conditions remain
unchanged.
To simplify the capital structure, the directors are also proposing to
convert the participation certificates into bearer shares on the basis of
one share for every five PCs.
