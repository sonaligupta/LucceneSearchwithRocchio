FT  29 APR 94 / People: L&G takes steps to comply


Last month, failures to meet standards set by Lautro, the life industry's
regulator, cost Legal & General some Pounds 400,000 in a then-record fine
and in costs; this month, the insurance group appointed Diana Miller to the
new post of director (compliance).
Miller, 43, joined L&G in 1988, initially as group legal services manager.
It was her close involvement with Lautro during the discussions on the
compliance failures and the subsequent report she prepared for the board
recommending the establishment of the new job that convinced L&G that she
should take on the task.
While she reports primarily to the sales and marketing managing director,
she also has a direct - if dotted - line to the board as a whole.
'It will give me the opportunity, if necessary, to talk to the non-executive
directors,' she says. 'Also, the board was very unhappy that we should be
disciplined, and this system will allow (the directors) to have confidence
that I'm competent and they're happy with the compliance arrangements.'
She plays down the need to undertake a morale-boosting exercise in the light
of the Lautro criticism: 'The publicity and everything clearly made everyone
feel very unhappy, but the charges and disciplinary action were historic to
some extent (they related to 1991-92), and we have moved very considerably
since that time.'
She is clear that compliance cannot simply be a question of a small
department policing a salesforce, but emphasises that the monitoring of the
systems and procedures which Lautro found unsatisfactory for checking that
sales agents had complied have already been strengthened.
