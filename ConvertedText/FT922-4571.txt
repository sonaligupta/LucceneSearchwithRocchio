FT  04 JUN 92 / International Company News: UK plays down capital adequacy
hopes


   By DAVID OWEN


THE BRITISH government last night sought to play down expectations that an
EC capital adequacy directive might be agreed by EC ministers next week.
Mr Anthony Nelson, junior Treasury minister, warned the EC against rushing
ahead to set a solution in stone on the grounds that it could damage the
wider movement towards international convergence.
Britain was concerned that the requirements finally agreed should be
appropriately tailored to the different kinds of business the directive
covered, Mr Nelson said.
A simple blanket application to securities business of requirements that
were designed for long term and illiquid banking risks would do unnecessary
damage to key participants for no corresponding prudential benefit.
Hopes had been raised that EC ministers would be asked to give their formal
approval to the directive on June 9, following last month's tabling of a
compromise replacing a so-called 'hard limit' on the exposures taken on by
investment firms with a more flexible limit.
Portuguese representatives may be particularly keen to reach a broad
political agreement on the issue before the Portuguese presidency of the EC
ends this month, it had been suggested.
Mr Nelson welcomed the Commission's recently proposed draft directive on
deposit protection, while warning that the government had concerns about
certain details.
He cautioned that the end-1992 target-date for a decision on the site of the
European Monetary Institute and the European Central Bank was very
ambitious.
He was responding to comments on the future of British banking within the EC
made by Sir Thomas Arnold, the Conservative MP for Hazel Grove.
