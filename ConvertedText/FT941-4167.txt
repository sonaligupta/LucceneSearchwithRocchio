FT  12 MAR 94 / Liberal Democrat spring policy conference opens


   By KEVIN BROWN


The 1,300 delegates at the Liberal Democrat spring policy conference will
debate a range of initiatives designed to set the stage for the
parliamentary, local and European elections in the next three months, Kevin
Brown writes.
Debates on issues such as the inner cities, homelessness, social policy and
prostitution are intended to sharpen the party's urban image for a battle
with the Tories for inner-city and European seats.
Party leaders acknowledge that the test will be the Eastleigh by-election
caused by the death of Mr Stephen Milligan, the Conservative MP. The party
believes it can win the seat, which would guarantee a high profile in the
European elections in June.
But Liberal Democrat strategists believe that the government may hold the
by-election as early as mid-April in an effort to catch the opposition
parties off guard.
