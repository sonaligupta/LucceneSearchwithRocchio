FT  23 OCT 92 / International Company News: Norwegian shipowner turns in
sharp slide

LEIF HOEGH, one of Norway's biggest shipowners, suffered a slide in
nine-month profits to NKr135m (Dollars 22m) from NKr454m in the same period
last year. The result stemmed from a weak dollar and poor markets for
tankers and dry bulk carriers.
The performance was far below average analysts' forecasts of a profit of
around NKr200m, but the group said it was satisfactory in light of
prevailing market conditions.
Freight income in the first nine months of this year fell by NKr125m to
NKr1.58bn as operating expenses rose by NKr86m to NKr362m. Last year's
comparative figure for profits included a NKr154m gain on the sales of ships
but no gains were registered during this year.
Leif Hoegh forecast operating profit for the year to reach NKr300m,
substantially down from NKr694m in 1991.
Vard, the Norwegian cruise-ship and ferry owner, saw losses for nine months
fall to NKr8.6m (Dollars 1.4m) from NKr62.6m last year, helped mainly by
growth in ferry traffic and a decline in operating expenses. Group operating
revenue remained steady at NKr4.113bn compared with NKr4.114bn last year.
