FT  16 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Plans for Spanish rating
agency


   By REUTER


   LONDON


STANDARD and Poor's, the US rating agency, and several Spanish organisations
plan to establish an agency in Madrid to evaluate the full range of debt
issues in the domestic Spanish capital market, Reuter reports from London.
The group also includes the Madrid, Bilbao and Valencia stock exchanges,
Instituto de Credito Oficial (ICO) and Compania Espanola de Seguros de
Credito a la Exportacion (Cesce).
S&P hopes to launch the rating agency in the summer or early autumn. It said
it was unable to provide details about the capitalisation of the new agency
or the breakdown of shareholdings.
The new agency will assess the bonds and commercial paper programmes of
corporations, financial institutions, utilities and local government
authorities, as well as structured financings.
Mr Antonio Zoida Martinez, vice-president of the Madrid Stock Exchange,
said: 'The introduction of ratings in Spain is a necessity which has been
recognised for some time, both by issuers and investors, to clarify risk
levels for debt securities.'
The partners have signed a letter of intent, but the transaction is subject
to a definitive shareholder's agreement.
