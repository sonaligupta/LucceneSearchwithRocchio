FT  22 JUL 93 / International Company News: NTT Data may seek listing on
Tokyo SE


   By AGENCIES


NTT Data Communications System, the computer software services arm of Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone (NTT), may be floated on the Tokyo stock exchange
next year, agencies report.
Mr Masashi Kojima, NTT president, said he would like the move to be made as
soon as possible: 'Everything will depend on the market's condition and we
have to choose the right time'.
NTT Data became an independent entity within NTT, Japan's large
telecommunications group, in 1988. By the end of the current year to March
1994, it will have business reports for five consecutive fiscal years as
required by the Tokyo stock exchange.
In addition to the disclosure criterion, the exchange requires 'a great
number of outstanding shares' and a good spread of shareholders, but the
exchange does not disclose specific numerical criteria.
Mr Kojima expected the proceeds of the flotation to ease the subsidiary's
heavy burden of interest payments.
NTT Data is Japan's biggest company specialising in computer system
integrations. It enjoyed sharp sales and profit growth during its first
three years.
Although the weakness of the economy has slowed sales growth in recent
years, the company was weathering the recession comparatively well because
of its large share of sales to the public sector, the company said.
Initial investment for each project sometimes amounted to hundreds of
billions of yen because half NTT Data's business involved leasing of
computers together with software. This inflated the company's need for
funds, and has resulted in a heavy financing burden, the company said.
For the year ended March, 1993, NTT Data's sales rose 10 per cent to
Y433.5bn (Dollars 4bn). Pre-tax profits tumbled 34 per cent to Y10.2bn.
