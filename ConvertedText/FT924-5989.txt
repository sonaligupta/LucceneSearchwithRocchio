FT  24 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Councils to get speed-limit powers


LOCAL authorities are get the power to impose speed limits on local roads
without application to the government, Mr John MacGregor, transport
secretary, said yesterday.
The change will make it easier for county councils to impose limits on busy
roads passing through villages. The Department of Transport will keep
responsibility for limits on trunk roads.
