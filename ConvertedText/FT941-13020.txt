FT  27 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Bullough beats expectations with Pounds
9.18m


   By PAUL TAYLOR


Bullough, the office products and refrigeration group, yesterday reported an
increased full year outcome reflecting sharply improved operating profits
partly offset by higher restructuring charges and net interest costs.
Pre-tax profits in the year to October 31 increased to Pounds 9.18m from a
restated Pounds 5.98m in the previous year when, under FRS 3, profits were
reduced by a Pounds 2.56m loss on the sale of discontinued operations.
The pre-tax line was struck after first-half restructuring costs of Pounds
4.67m (Pounds 3.32m).
The results were ahead of market expectations and the shares, which have
risen sharply since the start of December when they stood at 124p, gained a
further 14p to close at 186p.
Turnover slipped slightly to Pounds 271.4m (Pounds 276.9m) but operating
profits jumped by 21 per cent to Pounds 15.3m (Pounds 12.7m) with all the
group's divisions improving their contributions slightly.
Refrigeration and store fitting boosted turnover to Pounds 93.5m (Pounds
89.2m) but operating profits rose only slightly to Pounds 5.75m (Pounds
5.66m) reflecting increased competition and thin margins.
Heating division turnover was also higher at Pounds 35.1m (Pounds 31.6m) and
operating profits increased to Pounds 4.09m (Pounds 3.48m), partly helped by
the return to the black at the restructured Reznor business in Belgium.
The office products side managed a modest Pounds 628,000 profit following a
Pounds 736,000 loss the previous year on turnover which fell to Pounds 93m
(Pounds 104.4m).
Within the division, Atal's sales fell by 21 per cent and the French
business underwent a substantial restructuring as a result of which it is
expected to return to the black this year. In the UK, Project's sales were
also lower and pressure on margins resulted in a significant drop in
profits.
Net interest costs rose to Pounds 1.5m (Pounds 994,000), mainly because of
currency movements and lower interest rates on the group's cash deposits.
However, net borrowings fell from Pounds 15.3m to Pounds 3.8m reflecting the
group's strongly positive net cash flow.
Earnings per share fell to 3.07p (4.57p) following a substantially higher
tax charge because losses at Atal could not be relieved against profits
earned in the UK. The final dividend is maintained at 4.3p, making an
unchanged total for the year of 6.05p.
COMMENT
The outlook for Bullough looks a great deal brighter than it did 18 months
ago and market confidence has been further boosted by the appointment of Mr
Gordon Bond as chief executive. Having dealt with the French office products
business the immediate task will be to arrest Project's sliding profits in
the UK and to try to boost anaemic margins elsewhere. This year interest
costs will be lower, tax should return to more usual levels, and any further
restructuring costs should be less than 10 per cent of operating earnings.
Pre-tax profits could reach Pounds 16.5m, producing earnings of about 8.8p
this year, but the recent run-up in the share price means they are trading
on a prospective p/e of 21.2 and have limited further potential.
