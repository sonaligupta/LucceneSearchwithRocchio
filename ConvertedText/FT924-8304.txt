FT  12 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Liffe closer to agreement
over Globex


   By TRACY CORRIGAN


THE London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (Liffe) is
moving closer to agreement on terms for joining Globex, the after-hours
trading system jointly developed by the Chicago Board of Trade the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange and Reuters, following further meetings with
representatives of the two US exchanges in London this week.
The US exchanges appear to be adopting a more flexible attitude to the issue
of Liffe's initial commitment to the system.
Liffe has been pressing for a short time-span before it has an opportunity
to withdraw.
The exchanges have also moved closer together on the issue of exclusivity -
the rule that only one product in any underlying cash market can be listed
on Globex.
Liffe has now accepted the principle that any contract commanding over 50
per cent of world market share will be listed on Globex.
