FT  12 MAR 93 / Technology: DIY at the supermarket - Worth Watching


   By DELLA BRADSHAW


Do-it-yourself checkout desks are the latest US supermarket development set
to move into Europe.
Developed by Uniquest, of Jacksonville, Florida, the supermarket conveyor
belts are covered by a perspex tunnel. Underneath, scanning equipment reads
the barcode on each item while an in-built weighing system checks the weight
of the product. Lasers check the shape of the item to verify its identity.
Any discrepancy and the belt reverses direction, sending the shopping
backwards.
Advanced Cybernetics Inter-national (ACI), which will sell the system in the
UK, says that only one employee is needed to take the money from customers
using three conveyor belts. Uniquest: US, 800 488 9773. ACI: UK, 021 643
4344.
