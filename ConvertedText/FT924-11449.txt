FT  26 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Clinton's drug test


Mr Bill Clinton's plans for reducing government spending on healthcare have
spooked the US stock market. Pharmaceutical companies have notably
underperformed since the market started thinking seriously about the chances
of a Democratic victory. Judging by the shaky performance of Glaxo,
SmithKline Beecham and Wellcome shares in London last week, the condition is
contagious. The market may be wrong, though, to make the snap judgement that
a new deal on health will be universally bad for the sector.
True, the pharmaceuticals industry made full use of its freedom to raise
prices in the world's largest drug market during the 1980s. By restricting
price rises to the rate of inflation, President Clinton would lower earnings
growth for the sector over the coming decade. But a cost-conscious
government may also realise that innovative drugs save money by keeping
patients at work and out of hospital. Companies which deliver such products
will hold strong cards.
Companies with a weak product range and little volume sales growth are at
greater risk of squeeze. Just as rising asset prices supported inefficient
banks, drug price inflation has disguised a multitude of weaknesses in the
pharmaceutical sector. Companies with strong new drugs and volume sales
growth are already exercising voluntary restraint on prices. For second-rate
players, though, the cost of failure looks likely to rise.
