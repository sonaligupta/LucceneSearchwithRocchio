AN EXTRA Pounds 24m is to be spent on the economic regeneration programme in

cash will allow 30 new schemes, including a crime-prevention project for
north and west Belfast.
It brings to Pounds 124m the amount set aside for the Making Belfast Work
initiative aimed at boosting economic development and education in some of
the city's most troubled and deprived areas.
