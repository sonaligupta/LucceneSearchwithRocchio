FT  12 MAR 93 / West urged to intervene more in Iraq


   By ANDREW GOWERS


WESTERN countries should consider stepping up their intervention in Iraq by
barring the Baghdad regime from deploying heavy weaponry in the south of the
country, a senior Iranian leader has suggested.
Dr Hassan Rowhani, secretary-general of the National Security Council,
Iran's top foreign policy body, said the 'no-fly zone' imposed by the US,
Britain and France over southern Iraq would help protect the region's
inhabitants from the forces of President Saddam Hussein only if supplemented
by a ban on heavy weapons similar to that already imposed in the Kurdish
region to the north. He was speaking to journalists on Wednesday night
during a private visit to London.
Dr Rowhani's comments indicate that the Iranian leadership is closely
monitoring western policy towards Iraq from the sidelines, in the hope that
external pressure will eventually topple Mr Saddam's regime. He said the
west had missed an opportunity to do so immediately after the 1991 Gulf war,
when Shia Moslems in the south and Kurds in the north rose up against their
ruler. Mr Saddam's survival, he added, presented the west with 'a difficult
dilemma - and it has not decided what to do.'
Dr Rowhani played down western fears that removing a strong central
government in Baghdad could lead to Iraq's partition along ethnic and
sectarian lines.
Instead, he said, negotiating a secure future for the people of Iraq was one
of many regional issues on which the west shared common interests with Iran,
if only countries such as the US and Britain could overcome differences with
the Islamic republic.
