FT  30 JUN 93 / Clinton in plea to small business


   By JUREK MARTIN


   WASHINGTON


PRESIDENT Bill Clinton, enjoying a boost in his approval ratings after the
weekend raid on Iraq, yesterday returned as promised to domestic affairs by
exhorting small businessmen to support his budget reduction and health care
programmes.
In a speech to a conference in Washington, he complimented elements in both
versions of the budget bill passed by Congress, particularly approving some
of the incentives for small business in the House measure but watered down
in the Senate.
The budget plan, he said, 'is great on deficit reduction. It does invest
some money in the future, but it doesn't invest anything like what you would
want us to invest if we weren't strung up by the heels by the deficit. And
there is no answer to it except to get health costs in line with inflation.'
Failure to accomplish this, he added, could 'break the country.'
He sympathised with small businessmen who were 'paying out the ears' for
health care insurance and invited them to 'join the debate' about the right
solution.
But he disclosed few details of the proposed blueprint being drawn by the
the task force under Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton.
This will not be unveiled until after Congress disposes of the budget and
possibly may not be made public until September.
A poll conducted by the New York Times and CBS News yesterday confirmed not
only general backing for the raid on Iraq but also a lift in the president's
own previously sagging approval ratings.
