FT  11 APR 94 / Fimbra to raise fears over PIA


   By ALISON SMITH


Concerns from Fimbra, the self-regulating organisation for independent
financial advisers, about the new watchdog to protect private investors are
to be raised today with Mr Anthony Nelson, the junior Treasury minister.
Fimbra will tell Mr Nelson of its doubts about arrangements for handing over
its responsibilities to the Personal Investment Authority.
Giving evidence last month to the cross-party inquiry by MPs into financial
regulation, Sir Kenneth Clucas, Fimbra chairman, stressed that Fimbra was
urging independent financial advisers to apply to come under the new
regulator.
It was a report by Sir Kenneth that originally proposed the establishment of
a single regulating organisation to cover all retail financial services.
But continuing uncertainties about how much support the PIA will attract
have led some Fimbra council members to question whether they should
acquiesce to their organisation being wound up before the PIA's future is
assured.
The Fimbra concerns relate to matters such as the transfer of assets and
liabilities, but also reflect a deeper anxiety about the PIA. Mr Nelson is
expected to tell Fimbra that it will definitely go ahead.
The meeting will take place on the same day that Lord Oliver of Aylmerton,
who was appointed by SIB, begins hearing representations appealing for the
continuance of the existing regulators, as a part of the formal process
before they can be wound up. The hearings are to last about six weeks.
