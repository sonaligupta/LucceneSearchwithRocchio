FT  23 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil price slips as Opec meeting
is postponed


   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES


NORTH SEA oil prices slipped by 15 cents in late trading as Mr Jean Ping,
Gabon's oil minister and current president of the Organisation of Petroleum
Exporting Countries postponed its emergency meeting, planned for July 28.
Mr Ping who had been holding talks in Jeddah with Saudi Arabia's oil
minister Mr Hisham Nazer, said that the organisation had not had enough time
for consultations before its meeting next Wednesday and so it would now be
put off at least until the second week of August.
Opec called an emergency meeting on Monday after a sharp fall in prices on
fears that Iraq was close to an accord with the United Nations that would
allow it to supply Dollars 1.6bn-worth of oil or 500,000 to 600,000 barrels
a day over six months. The market is already well supplied as most of Opec's
members are producing more than their share of the overall ceiling.
However, Opec members have their hands tied in deciding a plan of action
until they know the details of any Iraqi accord with the UN. Since Iraq's
negotiators have not yet returned from Baghdad to New York, talks are
unlikely to resume until next week.
The oil prices have risen on the back of the lull in the Iraqi talks and the
scheduled Opec meeting, taking some of the pressure off ministers who feel
that to meet before they know the full terms of an Iraqi deal would be
worthless.
