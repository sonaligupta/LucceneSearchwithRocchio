FT  23 NOV 92 / Airbus sets long distance passenger flight record

AN AIRBUS A340 - the new flagship of the European aircraft consortium - set
a record for a non-stop passenger flight from Europe when it touched down in
Honolulu at the weekend after 16 hours and 12,500km.
The Lufthansa flight was part of an exhaustive airworthiness certification
exercise for the new aircraft.
To help pass the time during the flight, passengers were treated to what
seemed an unending banquet of food, a wine tasting, and live music by two
Hawaiian minstrels accompanied by a Hawaiian dancer. This sort of special
treatment is unlikely to be available when regular Lufthansa and Air France
flights with the A340 begin next year.
The introduction of the wide-bodied, four-engined A340 is expected to usher
in a new era of long distance non-stop flights. In its Dash 200 version, it
has the longest range of any civil aircraft. It can carry 263 passengers up
to 14,500km on 16- to 17-hour non-stop flights. It will also enable Airbus
to challenge more aggressively the dominance in this market of US
manufacturers.
At the end of the Lufthansa flight, Mr Jean Pierson, Airbus chief executive,
warned that the commercial aircraft industry would remain under intense
pressure well into next year and probably into 1994.
In spite of the deep recession in the airline industry, he said he still
expected the consortium to show an operating profit this year. But net
profit was threatened by financial provisions to cover future aircraft
delivery risks as well as possible order cancellations and deferrals by
financially troubled airlines.
Airbus, whose partners include British Aerospace, Deutsche Aerospace,
Aerospatiale of France and Casa of Spain, last year reported its first
operating profit, totalling about Dollars 220m (Pounds 145m).
