FT  28 JAN 94 / Lautro fines life house Pounds 70,000


Laurentian Life was yesterday fined Pounds 70,000 plus costs by Lautro for
what the self-regulating organisation called 'serious breaches of its
rules'.
Lautro said its disciplinary committee accepted that Laurentian had since
taken 'wide-ranging measures to put in place satisfactory arrangements for
securing an acceptable level of compliance with the code by
representatives'.
It said Laurentian had agreed to pay 'appropriate compensation to any
investor' who had suffered a loss as a result of being advised to buy an
unsuitable contract.
Laurentian had failed to ensure that representatives gave 'best advice' to
investors.
