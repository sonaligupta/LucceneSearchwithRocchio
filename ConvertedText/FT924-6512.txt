FT  20 NOV 92 / Observer: Newcastle bound


Sunderland on the River Wear, has long been engaged in rivalry with
neighbouring Tyneside. The dispute has normally centred on football but now
Wearsiders have a new reason to feel a little sore about their rivals on the
Tyne.
Nissan's announcement yesterday that it is moving the export of its
Sunderland-made Primeras and Micras from Teesside to the Port of Tyne,
rather than the port of Sunderland, is a matter of some regret for
Wearsiders, but not entirely unexpected.
Much more wounding is the realisation that this means Nissan's newest
car-carrying ship, named City of Sunderland only this month in honour of the
city where Nissan's UK car plant is based, will from 1994 be plying in and
out of the Tyne, bearing Sunderland-made cars.
Nissan, however, is aware of Wearsiders' sensibilities about the
neighbouring Geordies. 'It won't go to the Port of Tyne before it's visited
Sunderland on its maiden voyage,' promises a Nissan spokesman.
