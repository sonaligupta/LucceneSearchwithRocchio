FT  26 MAY 93 / Arts: Today's Television


   By GARY MEAD


Potentially such a good night's viewing that even the well-written and
finely acted Brookside (Channel 4, 8pm) may find itself losing a few
viewers.
ITV continues to show signs of desperation, scheduling the European
champions' cup final (ITV, 7.10pm) at an hour when it hopes to tempt
floating viewers away from a run of excellent prospects elsewhere.
No chance. I was weaned on Gunsmoke (BBC2, 6.50pm) and Marshal Matt Dillon
(played by James Arness) was an early and lasting icon. The series
originally ran for 20 years, between 1955-75. Let's hope the repeats get as
long a run this time round.
Following Mr Dillon, BBC just gets more absorbing. Open space (BBC2, 7.40pm)
talks to prisoners on Death Row in Trinidad, part of the crime and
punishment season.
But unfortunately the BBC goes in for its own crazy scheduling around peak
viewing, with two challenging programmes jostling for attention. There's a
chance to see Country (BBC2, 9pm), the Trevor Griffiths play; half an hour
later Inside story (BBC1, 9.30pm) promises an investigation of Tiny Rowland.
