FT  25 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Dollar earners suffer


   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON


DRUGS group Glaxo was one of many big dollar earning stocks to lead the
London market down yesterday. The shares dropped 29 to 701p on turnover of
2.8m, and marketmakers said that around 20p of the fall represented the
tumble in the dollar over the weekend.
When dealing in Glaxo American Depositary Receipts (ADRs)  - the US
equivalent of shares  - ended on Friday night they stood at Dollars 27 3/4 .
One ADR represents two shares and so the equivalent UK price was around
720p. As trading in London began yesterday morning the slide in the dollar
meant that the equivalent UK share price had fallen to around 700p.
The effect is compounded by Glaxo's earnings profile. The group derives 40
per cent of turnover and around half of its profits from North America. On
September 10, it is expected to announce full-year results to end-June of
around Pounds 1.4bn.
Other dollar earners with ADR listings which were affected yesterday
included Reuters, down 27 at 1017p, ICI, 23 cheaper at 1089p, and Hanson
(deriving around half its earnings from the US), off 5 at 185 1/2 p
ex-dividend, an 18-month low.
Redland worries
A market preoccupied with worries about the security of dividends, after
recent cuts in payments by companies such as BP and Sedgwick, settled on
Redland as another stock in danger of reducing its dividend for 1993.
The chances of a 20 per cent cut in Redland's payment were highlighted by
Panmure Gordon, the stockbroker, and saw Redland shares fall to 374p before
a late rally left them a net 22 off at 381p. Turnover was a healthy 1.1m
shares.
Mr Robin Hardy, building materials analyst at Panmure, cited 'thin earnings
cover and the poor outlook in the UK' for the pessimistic stance on
Redland's dividend prospects. He also noted that the shares had performed
very strongly relative to the rest of the sector since its takeover of
Steetley, the brick manufacturer, earlier this year.
Other building analysts, however, adopted an opposite view to Panmure. In a
20-page research document Goldman Sachs described Redland as 'attractively
priced', adding that, should a recovery in the UK be further delayed, the
broad geological spread of its activities and strong financial position
restrict the downside.
Forte hints
Hints that Forte's negotiations to sell its Gardner Merchant subsidiary may
be entering a crucial stage gathered force, with some sources close to the
company indicating that an announcement was likely 'sooner rather than
later'.
Negotiations to sell Gardner and the airport catering businesses broke down
two months ago when Forte decided the Pounds 425m offer from Compass Group
was too low. The collapse of the talks hit Forte shares badly and sentiment
was further undermined by stock market criticism of the board's handling of
the situation. The shares improved 3 to 130p yesterday.
The threat of huge insurance claims arising from Hurricane Andrew, which was
hitting the coast of Florida as London markets closed, and worries about a
possible increase in UK interest rates left the composite insurers in
disarray.
Analysts estimated that damage to Florida alone could reach as much as
Dollars 6bn, and that if the hurricane extended to Texas and Louisiana then
the damages bill would almost certainly top Dollars 10bn and could possibly
reach Dollars 20bn.
Royal weakened 18 to 145p and General Accident 8 to 417p, but Guardian Royal
later rebounded to close only a shade off at 129p on the day.
Dealers were surprised at the resilience of most of the leading oil shares
which, in spite of the dependence on dollar earnings, outperformed the wider
market. Shell Transport was an exception, sliding 15 to 452p, with
specialists saying the stock had held up well as other oils plummeted
earlier this year. BP, still feeling the effects of another negative blast
from UK broking houses, lost 5 more to 185p.
Specialist metals refiner Johnson Matthey was one of the very few bright
spots in the UK yesterday, responding to a bounce in the Japanese stock
market. Japan is a big investor in platinum and Matthey is the world's
largest platinum marketing group. The shares firmed 2 to 385p.
Dollar-earning SmithKline Beecham held up well in light of the plunging US
currency. Analysts said the company had hedged itself effectively against
currency fluctuations. The 'A' shares dipped 7 to 454p and the units, which
tend to represent US interest, finished only 3 cheaper at 412p.
Water and electricity shares continued to benefit from their perceived
defensive qualities. Among waters, Northhumbrian put on 2 to 500p, Severn
Trent 3 to 422p and South West a penny to 424p.
Electricity shares also gained interest from institutions trading out of the
Electricity Package, which ceases to be traded on September 4, and into
selected electricity stocks. Midland gained 3 to 338p, Norweb 4 to 361p and
Southern 7 to 335p. The package declined 12 to 3283p.
George Wimpey suffered in an unhappy building sector, with a leading UK
broker turning bearish ahead of the interims. Worries about post-results
profits downgrades and the stock's recent outperformance left the shares
closing 13 lower at 99p.
A rumour that Bass was negotiating to buy a 25 per cent stake in a Dutch
hotel group further undermined the shares in an already weak drinks sector.
The stock retreated 19 to 502p.
Arjo Wiggins Appleton was heavily traded, with Credit Lyonnais Laing said to
be active. The shares lost 5 to 207p on turnover of 8.7m.
