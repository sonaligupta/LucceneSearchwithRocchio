FT  24 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Era sets its sights on return to the
dividend list


   By RICHARD GOURLAY


ERA GROUP, the specialist retailer which includes Beatties hobbies and
Techno cameras in its stable, reported profits down 15 per cent but
continued its progress towards returning to the dividend list.
Mr Anthony Fay, chairman, said the holding company should be in a good
position to pay preference and possibly ordinary dividends next year if 1992
trading goes as planned.
The deficit on shareholders funds had been reduced to a small negative level
by retained profits of Pounds 1.26m.
Earnings per share fell from 2.44p to 2.18p.
Pre-tax profits declined from Pounds 2.55m to Pounds 2.17m on sales down 3
per cent at Pounds 71.1m.
Mr Fay said the group had swapped Pounds 7m of its debt, which averaged
Pounds 13m over the year, into a five year loan facility.
More customers had visited the hobbies stores but on average, had spent
less.
Consumer confidence had started bad, deteriorated and had not picked up for
Christmas, he said. The group, nevertheless, maintained gross margins.
