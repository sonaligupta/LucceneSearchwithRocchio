FT  23 JUL 94 / C&G makes most profit per customer


   By ALISON SMITH


Cheltenham & Gloucester Building Society made an average of Pounds 82 profit
out of each of its 1.4m customers last year, according to analysis carried
out by Datamonitor, the market research group.
This made it the society profiting most from its customer base. The next
most profitable per customer was Woolwich Building Society, the UK's third
largest, which made an average of Pounds 39 out of each its 4.2m customers.
It was the most successful at generating commission income through its
branches.
The research into the different strategies adopted by societies for their
branch networks revealed that the way the network was run was unprofitable
for some societies.
The figures suggest that Leeds & Holbeck made a loss of Pounds 24 a customer
on its branch network last year, while Nationwide, the second-largest
society by asset size but with the largest branch network, made a Pounds 13
loss per customer.
They also show that for a significant minority of societies analysed, the
branch network was broadly neutral in terms of profit last year.
Datamonitor said yesterday that the calculations took account only of the
profitability of societies' branches, and not of profits from other aspects
of their activities, such as dealing in wholesale money markets, or from
estate agents.
Although C&G is the sixth-largest society by assets, it has only 236
branches and mortgage centres, contributing to a low cost-income ratio. It
is the object of an agreed cash bid of Pounds 1.8bn from Lloyds Bank.
Datamonitor said its research showed Halifax, Alliance & Leicester and
Nationwide, three of the four largest societies, had relatively low
commission income per customer but higher numbers of customers per branch,
while other societies concentrated on generating higher levels of net
commission per customer.
Halifax is to set up its own life insurance operation from the start of next
year, and Nationwide announced in May that it too intended to set up life
insurance and unit trust subsidiaries.
Datamonitor saw the greatest scope for percentage increases in generating
new net income for A&L and Nationwide.
