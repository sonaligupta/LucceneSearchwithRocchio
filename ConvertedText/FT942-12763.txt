FT  28 APR 94 / Digital plans to move Scots plant


Digital Equipment plans to move its personal computer manufacturing
operations in Scotland to a separate facility near its plant in Ayr.
Digital said the move would have no impact on jobs but would create room for
possible future expansion. Its Ayr payroll has increased from 1,200 to 2,000
in the past year. It would not comment on reports that the new plant would
be at Irvine, 14 miles from Ayr.
