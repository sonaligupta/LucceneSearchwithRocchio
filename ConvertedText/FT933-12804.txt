FT  22 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Currencies


If the French authorities are looking for lower German interest rates to
support the franc, they will not have had much encouragement from
yesterday's money supply figures. An M3 growth rate over 7 per cent leaves
the Bundesbank little leeway to relax without losing credibility.
The bank could point to the strength of the D-Mark and Germany's low bond
yields as mitigating worry about inflation. It also notes that consumer
prices, which rose 4.2 per cent in the year to June, are a lagging
indicator. But higher insurance premiums mean July's figure, due next week,
will again be high. That will make it even harder for the bank to lower
rates before the summer holidays.
Since the bank's money market repurchase rate is now only 40 basis points
above the discount rate, there is not even much scope for the kind of
piecemeal easing which has now become familiar. Besides, foreign exchange
markets increasingly consider that France's economic problems call for more
than the mere establishment of a slow downward trend in European interest
rates. Since the franc is at the bottom of the system, Germany could place
the onus on France to follow Denmark in raising rates if its currency hit
the floor. But France could then end up looking as silly as the UK did last
September.
