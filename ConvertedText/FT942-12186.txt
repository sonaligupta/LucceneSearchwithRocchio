FT  30 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: How to track the best performers -
Beating an index may seem an elementary challenge for a fund manager, but
there are alarmingly few who meet it


   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU


Trackers aim to deliver the returns on an index through a variety of
methods. In the UK, most tracker funds aim to follow the FT-SE-A All-Share
but there are others which track FT-SE 100 companies, the mid-250 and
smaller companies indices. Most trackers are unit trusts but investment
trusts also offer ways of following an index.
Unit trusts
Compared with other unit trusts, tracker funds have done surprisingly well.
Table 2 shows that in the three years to April 1, the FT-A-All Share index
grew by more than 45 per cent while the average unit trust in the UK equity
general sector, the home of UK trackers, rose by 26.8 per cent. All the
trackers listed easily beat the average and the same holds true for the
trackers with a five-year record.
A tracker holds many advantages for the private investor, not least a
drastic reduction in their choice of 1,500 funds or so, and lower charges.
Table 1 lists the main trackers. With the exception of Gartmore, the initial
charge on most is at the lower end of the industry average of between 5.25
per cent and 6 per cent. Gartmore eliminated its initial charge altogether
in 1992.
More importantly, annual charges are well below the 1.5 per cent which most
unit trust investors expect. Many of the funds' annual charge is a fraction
of this, at 0.5 per cent or less, with some of the James Capel and John
Govett funds at 1 per cent and Norwich Union's international index tracker
at 1.25 per cent. While an initial charge can be made up over time, a high
annual charge is more detrimental to a fund's performance and to an
investor's returns.
But how well do the trackers deliver what they promise? None can match the
index because of their charges - this is clearly illustrated in the one year
performance figures in Table 2 which show the trackers falling further
behind the FT-SE-A All-Share than over three and five year.
Others are simply less good at tracking than others, although fund managers
will come up with various defensive arguments such as only aiming to track
the capital performance of the index.
Some unit trust trackers, notably John Govett, use derivatives such as
futures and options to track the indices. With the exception of its FT-SE
mid-250 fund, which uses shares, this makes its UK funds ineligible for a
personal equity plan holding. Govett also has a range of bull and bear funds
(not listed) which aim to do the opposite of an index and which are best
left to institutions or to experienced investors. Investment trusts
There are only a few investment trusts which track indices in a similar way
to unit trusts. These include Edinburgh Fund Managers' Malvern UK trust,
which tracks the FT-SE-A All Share index. Hoare Govett, has two smaller
companies trusts tracking its own smaller companies index, and Abtrust has a
New Europe investment trust to track the FT-A Europe index.
The costs of investing through an investment trust are those you would
usually pay when buying shares - stamp duty, stockbroker's commission and
the bid/offer spread - but there may also be a small annual management fee.
Malvern, for example, charges an annual fee of 0.25 per cent and the
administrative expenses of the trust, which come off the investment income,
are about 0.4 per cent per annum.
However, John Spiers, of Best Investment, is not an enthusiast: 'Someone who
wants a tracker wants predictability but with an investment trust, you have
the added problem of the discount or premium.' The price of shares in an
investment trust is set by supply and demand and so it does not necessarily
correspond with the asset value of the trust. When the supply of shares
exceeds demand, trust shares tend to trade at a discount to the asset value.
The investment trust sector does have an alternative. Some trusts have
issued loan stock (see Table 3)which has a prior charge on the trust's
assets.
The loan stock is dated but instead of being redeemed at par, it will be
redeemed at the level of the index. There is also a dividend, usually in
line with the All-Share. Nigel Sidebottom, of stockbroker Gerrard Vivian
Gray, says: 'They are a pure tracker because no replication is required -
what matters is that the trust has sufficient funds to repay the loan stock
at redemption.'
The only costs to the holder of the stock are dealing charges; there are no
management fees to dilute performance. The management costs of the trust
itself are borne by ordinary shareholders.
The main danger is poor performance leading to an inability on the part of
the trust to meet its liabilities at redemption. Since holders of loan stock
rank ahead of ordinary shareholders, the trust would have to perform very
poorly to be unable to meet these liabilities, according to Sidebottom.
John Korwin-Szymanowski, of SG Warburg Securities, says there are some
safeguards. Trustees of the loan stock, whose job it is to monitor
performance, can step in to take measures if they think the trust may be in
danger of not meeting its liabilities.
The table shows the main loan stocks which track the FT-SE-A All-Share. To
make comparisons with the index easier, the trusts set the asset value at a
price (in pounds) arrived at by dividing the level of the index by 1000.
Prices of the stock listed are all reassuringly close to that of the index.
Since loan stock can only be bought in a relatively small market, it may
trade at a discount or premium to the index. If you buy stock at a discount
and hold it to redemption, you can expect outperformance of the index
(assuming the loan stock is paid in full). However, a discount can be an
indication of greater risk.
