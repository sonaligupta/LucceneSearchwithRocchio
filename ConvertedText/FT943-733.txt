FT  28 SEP 94 / US sets up guard for Haiti deputies


   By JAMES HARDING


American troops took over and sealed off Haiti's parliament building and the
Port-au-Prince municipal headquarters yesterday in preparation for the
return of elected officials.
The parliament was to convene today, with 10 deputies and two senators
scheduled to return to begin discussions on an amnesty law for Haitian
military leaders. The amnesty was part of the deal worked out by the
military junta and a Washington delegation to avoid a US invasion.
US officials said they expected the mayor of Port-au-Prince, Mr Evans Paul,
to return to his office tomorrow. Mr Paul, who was President Jean-Bertrand
Aristide's campaign manager, has been in hiding for much of the three years
since Mr Aristide was overthrown by the army.
Meanwhile, at the UN in New York, the US said it might try to have the
Security Council pass a resolution tomorrow automatically lifting UN
sanctions on Haiti as soon as Mr Aristide returns.
Earlier yesterday, 2,000 hungry Haitians looted a European-funded food
warehouse in Port-au-Prince, fighting each other for bags of rice and beans.
The US army also suffered its first fatality of the operation when a soldier
died from gunshot wounds in an apparent suicide.
