FT  03 AUG 92 / Satellite meets hitch

   FLORIDA


A European science satellite encountered guidance problems yesterday hours
after its deployment from the space shuttle, the US space agency Nasa said,
Reuter reports from Florida.
Astronauts aboard the Atlantis shuttle said the Dollars 426m (Pounds 223m)
satellite appeared to pitch over shortly after its gas jets ignited to boost
it to its working altitude of 325 miles. The shuttle chased the European
Retrievable Satellite, known as Eureca, in an effort to help ground
controllers maintain contact with it but no rendezvous was planned.
The shuttle is scheduled to return to Earth on Friday.
