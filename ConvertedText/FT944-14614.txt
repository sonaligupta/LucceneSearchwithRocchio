FT  21 OCT 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (13): A disappointed
man explains two upsets - 'Ahead of the index, but should have done better'
is the report at the end of year three


   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON


The decline in the value of the portfolio over the past quarter makes me
feel rather like a chastened hamster: I want to hide myself away in a pile
of wood-shavings.
I had hoped that, after three years, the portfolio would have doubled in
value. Instead, its performance has disappointed me, although it has still
comfortably 'beaten' the FT-SE Actuaries All-share index and shown better
results than just leaving UK currency on deposit with a bank or building
society.
I take comfort from having voiced pessimistic views all year and from an old
quotation by Edward Phelps: 'The man who makes no mistakes does not usually
make anything.'
Perhaps more appropriate is an even older comment from Edmund Burke: 'I am
convinced that we have a degree of delight, and that no small one, in the
real misfortunes and pains of others.'
Readers can therefore prepare to be 'delighted' as I explain how two recent
'disasters' damaged the portfolio.
In the summer article, written on June 30 but published on July 15 and 16, I
mentioned that the portfolio had 'bought' 6,000 shares in OIS International
for 55p each. A stop-loss figure (the price at which the shares would be
sold) was set at 40-42p.
No sooner did the Review appear than OIS announced (on July 18) a profits
warning, and the shares fell 18p in a day]
Why had I not foreseen such an event? OIS is a technical inspection services
group which only came to the market in 1992, via a placing at 50p per share.
Profits seemed to be on an upward trend.
Indeed, in a statement dated April 19, 1994, the chairman commented:
'Results have been encouraging'; and: 'I am confident that during the
current year we will continue to make good progress.'
Pre-tax profits for the year to December 31, 1993, were Pounds 2.2m. The
company's report revealed that Friends Provident, Edinburgh Fund Managers
and Perpetual Unit Trust Management were large shareholders in the company.
The financial figures looked respectable: gearing was only 4 per cent, and
the report mentioned improvements in profits in its Middle East activities,
with expansion plans for a number of other areas, including China, Thailand,
Indonesia and South America.
Yet what appeared rosy in April turned into comments of gloom in July, with
reports of reduced margins and the loss of a number of contracts.
The interim statement, dated September 16, revealed a pre-tax profit of only
Pounds 60,000, compared with Pounds 1.4m for the same period last year.
An even greater blow to the portfolio's recent performance was the plunge in
the share price of Alvis, in response to the company's September 23
statement mentioning that the group had been 'affected by volume shortfalls
caused by the cancellation or slippage of anticipated orders in both the
engineering and electro-optics businesses. In consequence of this, the
overall trading performance in the second half has been below the board's
expectations'.
Alvis had originally been included in the portfolio for its longer-term
potential, as Brierley Investments held a 29 per cent share stake and the
value of Alvis's shareholding in Avimo of Singapore was perhaps worth as
much as Alvis's own market capitalisation.
The portfolio had 'bought' 6,250 Alvis shares for 40p each in January and
seen them rise to 64p at the end of the last quarter.
If the portfolio had been much larger, with a wider spread of investments, I
might have decided to retain the Alvis shareholding in the hope of an upturn
in the company's fortunes and/or a takeover approach. However, I felt I had
to activate the stop-loss price of 40p in order to protect the immediate
value of the portfolio.
These two 'experiences' demonstrate the importance of stop-loss levels. The
portfolio managed to 'get out' of OIS at 42p and Alvis at 40p (the levels
set in the previous Review), thus avoiding their subsequent falls to 24p and
29p respectively.
As to the future of the portfolio, I remain concerned about the fickleness
of the market. Even some companies with assets worth considerably more than
their share price have fallen, whereas a number of companies which I think
have mediocre prospects have risen to what I believe are unsustainable
levels.
Governments around the world are struggling to borrow yet more money to
finance their spending plans, and they may be tempted to offer even higher
interest rates which could well have damaging effects on stock markets and
economic prospects.
Having suffered two 'disasters', I am not being tempted out of my pile of
wood shavings to invest in any more companies at present. Even the cash on
deposit may be switched into Swiss francs if I feel the pound might be under
some pressure. As to the portfolio's current holdings, stop-losses will be
set as follows: Allied Colloids (105-110p), William Ransom (38p), Pentland
(80p), Taylor Nelson AGB (28p).
The author of this feature, which first appeared in the autumn 1991 issue of
the Review, is familiar to many readers as the writer of the Diary of a
Private Investor column in the Weekend FT. The Review invited him to suggest
a Pounds 10,000 portfolio for capital growth, without being too speculative.
The views expressed are his own. He states that his personal pension fund
has a small holding in Alvis, OIS, William Ransom, Taylor Nelson AGB and
Pentland.
