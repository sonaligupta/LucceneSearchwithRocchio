FT  01 JUL 92 / International Company News: Italgas operating margin up 7%

ITALGAS, the quoted Italian gas and water distribution company which is
controlled by the state-owned ENI petroleum and chemicals group, raised
operating margins by 7.3 per cent in the first five months of this year.
Sales of gas and water increased in Italy and in foreign markets, said Mr
Carlo da Molo, chairman. Gas sales in Italy rose by 3.3 per cent in the
first five months of 1992, in spite of relatively mild weather, while water
sales jumped by 63 per cent in volume terms, thanks to contracts to supply a
further 42 towns.
The rise in operating profits stemmed from a 30 per cent fall in net
financial charges and rigorous cost controls as well as the higher sales, he
added. Last year, the group made net profits of L91bn (Dollars 76.21m) on
sales of L3,353bn.
Mr da Molo calmed fears about a possible interruption in gas supplies
following this week's political upheaval in Algeria, which supplies about a
quarter of Italy's natural gas requirements. Responding to a sharp fall in
the group's share price earlier this week, Mr da Molo expressed confidence
about the certainty of supplies from Algeria following contacts with
politicians and other parts of the ENI group.
Italgas is pushing ahead with its strategy to expand abroad, notably in
eastern Europe and Latin America. Mr da Molo revealed that it intended to
tender for a number of regional gas companies due to be privatised in
Hungary.
