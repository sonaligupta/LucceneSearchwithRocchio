FT  28 APR 94 / International Company News: CRA warns it may fail to
maintain results

CRA, the Australian mining and resources group in which RTZ of the UK holds
a 49 per cent interest, yesterday warned it was unlikely to match its 1993
operating profit result in the current year.
Mr John Uhrig, chairman, told the annual meeting in Melbourne that 'if metal
prices and currencies remain as they are at present there will be a
substantial reduction in sales revenue in 1994, compared with last year,
making it difficult to come near the 1993 level of profit from operations in
1994'.
Last year, CRA saw sales of ADollars 5.93bn (USDollars 4.17bn) and an
operating profit before tax of ADollars 1.06bn, up from ADollars 730.7m. Mr
Uhrig said while the year 'had started fairly strongly,' coal profits had
been hit by industry-wide stoppages called to protest at price agreements
reached between the Australian producers and Japanese buyers.
'The next three quarters will feel the impact of lower prices for iron ore
and coal sold to Japan,' he said.
The company also said it expected to concentrate around 70 per cent of its
exploration efforts in Australia this year.
