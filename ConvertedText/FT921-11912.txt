FT  29 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Mowlam opens attack on regulation
of Taurus - Financial Services


   By DAVID OWEN


LABOUR hit out last night at the government's handling of the financial
services sector, as the Commons discussed new regulations governing stock
exchange transactions.
The regulations, under the Companies Act 1989, are intended to provide the
legal underpinning for Taurus, the London Stock Exchange's electronic
transfer system which is expected to come onstream in May 1993. Addressing a
near-deserted chamber, Ms Marjorie Mowlam, Labour City and corporate affairs
spokeswoman, attacked the government on three counts.
First, its strategy was inconsistent in underpricing privatisation issues to
attract small investors while seeking to install a transfer system that
would favour large transactions.
Second, by setting up a parallel regulatory regime for Taurus, it was
'courting trouble for the future' by countenancing self-regulation without
accountability to an outside authority.
Third, compensation fund arrangements were not 'properly structured.' By
keeping Taurus outside the scope of the Investors' Compensation Scheme, the
government was 'forgoing the opportunity to draw on a wider pool of
contributors.'
However, Ms Mowlam gave a 'guarded welcome' to the regulations. Mr John
Redwood, corporate affairs minister, said it was now up to the stock
exchange to develop a system.
