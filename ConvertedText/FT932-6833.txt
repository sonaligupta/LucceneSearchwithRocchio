   BONN


The German federal government, facing sagging revenues and soaring
unemployment costs, will try to trim about DM20bn (Dollars 12.2bn) from its
1994 budget, government sources said yesterday, AP-DJ reports from Bonn.
German Finance Minister Theo Waigel announced over the weekend his intention
to seek new savings in the 'double digits of billions of marks,' and sources
said he narrowed this target in yesterday's talks with Chancellor Helmut
Kohl and other leaders of the ruling coalition.
The savings plan is expected to be tied up by mid-July, when the German
cabinet is to present its 1994 draft budget.
