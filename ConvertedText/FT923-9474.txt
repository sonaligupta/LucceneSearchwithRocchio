FT  05 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Housing market


Surely that is enough calls for decisive action to boost the UK housing
market. A whopping cut in UK interest rates or massive government spending
apart - two options which are clearly not on the agenda for the foreseeable
future - it is hard to see what can be done at a stroke to underpin house
prices and restore buyer confidence. Tired sounding, if headline-catching,
schemes from the Great and the Good not only look narrowly self-serving. As
yesterday's further round of jitters in the building materials sector
illustrates, the rhetoric which accompanies them merely spreads further
despondency.
