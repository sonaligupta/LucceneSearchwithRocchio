FT  11 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Rate cut sustains advance in
the Dow

Wall Street
US STOCK markets continued to draw strength from Thursday's interest rate
cut, with share prices posting solid advances, writes Patrick Harverson in
New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 30.41 at 3,255.37. The
more broadly based Standard & Poor's 500 also ended firmer, up 3.63 at
404.27. The Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks, however, gave
up its early gains, and ended down 2.51 at 584.24.
Turnover on the NYSE was heavy at 201m shares, and advances led declines by
a ratio of more than two to one.
The momentum provided by the quarter-point cut in the federal funds rate
sustained the market for a second day. The easing of policy relieved
investors, who were concerned that the economy lacked sufficient stimulus to
stage a decent recovery. The rate cut also raised hopes that the Fed may
loosen the monetary reins further in the near future.
The only hiccup yesterday came in the consumer prices data, which showed an
increase in March of 0.5 per cent, well above market estimates. The news
sent bond prices tumbling - theyield on the benchmark 30-year bond briefly
rose above 7.9 per cent - but failed to disturb sentiment in the equity
market. Most economists believed that the March CPI figure was an aberration
caused by one-off seasonal factors.
Among individual stocks, Digital Equipment continued to slide following
Thursday's disappointing fiscal third quarter loss, falling another Dollars
3 to Dollars 44 1/4 in turnover of almost 3m shares.
Also lower in the technology sector was Cypress Semiconductor, which dropped
Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 11 after Merrill Lynch downgraded its investment
rating on the stock and cut its first quarter estimates.
First Chicago stood out in the financial sector, rising Dollars 1 1/2 to
Dollars 29 1/2 after reporting first quarter profits of 71 cents a share, up
from 63 cents a share a year ago. Yet, in spite of the cut in interest
rates, other bank and securities industry stocks were in mixed form.
Chemical rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 31 3/4 , BankAmerica firmed Dollars
1/4 to Dollars 41 1/8 and Chase Manhattan added Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 22
5/8 , but Citicorp fell Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 15 5/8 , JP Morgan slipped
Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 55 1/4 , and Merrill Lynch gave up Dollars 1 3/8 at
Dollars 50.
On the over-the-counter market, Intel plunged Dollars 6 1/8 to Dollars 51
1/8 in turnover of almost 8.5m shares on news of a drop in first quarter
profits from 95 cents a share a year ago to 86 cents a share.
Ross Systems fell Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 10 3/8 after the company warned
it would post a loss of about 30 cents a share for the quarter ending last
month.

TORONTO STOCKS finished a wild week on a positive note. Based on preliminary
data, the composite index climbed 27.61 points to 3,376.64, about 9 points
on the week. Advances outnumbered declines 365 to 195 on volume of 23,896m
shares and trading value was CDollars 260.8m.
Every sub-group made gains, with the gold group up 2.58 per cent on index.
Management rose 1.23 per cent, real estate was up 1.10 per cent, energy
climbed 1.08 per cent and industrial products were up 1.08 per cent.
Consumer products, and mining were up moderately.
