FT  23 APR 93 / Peugeot loses resale court fight


   By ANDREW HILL


   BRUSSELS


PEUGEOT, the French car maker, will have to allow its Belgian and Luxembourg
dealers to supply independent intermediaries with cars for resale in other
countries, following a European Court ruling yesterday.
The decision should end Peugeot's long-running legal campaign against
Ecosystem, a Rouen-based intermediary which resells cars bought at lower
prices in Belgium and Luxembourg.
The court yesterday threw out appeals from Peugeot against a December 1991
European Commission decision, forcing the carmaker to lift its ban on
dealers in those countries supplying Ecosystem.
Under EC rules, it is not illegal for intermediaries to import cars on
behalf of individual customers. Sir Leon Brittan, then competition
commissioner, warned the French car maker in 1991 that its Belgian and
Luxembourg dealers would forfeit protection from normal competition rules if
the restrictions were not ended.
At the same time, the Commission laid out a code of buying and marketing
practices for intermediaries.
The Peugeot/Ecosystem case has been at the centre of an often acrimonious
debate about the exclusive dealership system operated by European car
manufacturers. The system is exempt from competition rules until 1995, and
consumer groups complain that it helps perpetuate price differences across
Europe.
Car makers say the dealership system is needed to ensure a proper
after-sales service. They say car price differences are mainly due to other
factors, such as discrepancies between car taxes.
