FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Red Book Details): Summary of main proposals for
tax and benefits


This section summarises the main tax proposals in the Budget. A full list of
changes is given in the accompanying table.
Income tax: The rate of income tax will be reduced to 20 per cent for the
first Pounds 2,000 of taxable income.
The personal allowance will be increased in line with the statutory
indexation provisions (based on the increase of 4.5 per cent in the Retail
Prices Index in the year to December 1991). So will the personal and married
couple's allowances for those aged 65 and over. Other allowances, and the
basic rate limit, will be unchanged.
For 1992-93 the levels will be:
personal allowance Pounds 3,445 (up Pounds 150);
married couple's allowance, additional personal allowance and widow's
bereavement allowance Pounds 1,720 (no change);
for those aged 65 to 74: personal allowance Pounds 4,200 (up Pounds 180) and
married couple's allowance Pounds 2,465 (up Pounds 110);
for those aged 75 and over: personal allowance Pounds 4,370 (up Pounds 190)
and married couple's allowance Pounds 2,505 (up Pounds 110);
income limit for age-related allowances Pounds 14,200 (up Pounds 700);
basic rate limit Pounds 23,700 (no change).
Married couples will be able to choose by agreement to give the married
couple's allowance to the wife instead of the husband, or to share it
equally between them, as from 1993-94. As an alternative, married women will
be able to claim half the allowance at their own request.
Benefits-in-kind: The car benefit scale charges, used both for income tax
and employers' national insurance contributions, will be increased by 4.5
per cent from 6 April 1992.
There will be a new, lower car fuel benefit scale for diesel cars. This will
be used both for income tax and employers' national insurance contributions.
The existing scales for assessing the benefit of employer-provided petrol
will be increased by 4.5 per cent. The fuel scale charges for VAT will be
similarly amended.
Charitable giving: The minimum limit for the Gift Aid scheme (tax relief on
single charitable donations from close companies or individuals) will be
reduced from Pounds 600 to Pounds 400 from 1 July 1992.
Savings: Savings of up to Pounds 6,000 a year, instead of Pounds 3,000 as at
present, will be allowed in qualifying unit or investment trusts through a
general Personal Equity Plan from 6 April 1992.
The capital gains tax annual exempt amount for 1992-93 will be increased in
line with the statutory indexation provisions from Pounds 5,500 to Pounds
5,800 in the case of individuals and from Pounds 2,750 to Pounds 2,900 in
the case of most trusts.
Business taxation: The limit of Pounds 8,000 on the cost of cars, above
which capital allowances and tax relief for lease rental payments are
restricted, will be raised to Pounds 12,000 from 11 March 1992.
The limit below which employers may pay PAYE/NIC quarterly rather than
monthly will be raised from an average monthly bill of Pounds 400 to Pounds
450, for deductions made after 6 April 1992.
The Business Expansion Scheme will be abolished from the end of 1993, when
relief for private rented housing expires. In the meantime the scheme will
be amended to make it easier for companies to use the relief for mortgage
rescue schemes.
Banks, brokers and other agents who deduct tax from payments of foreign
dividends and interest will have to account for the tax which they deduct on
a monthly basis from October 1992; the statutory remuneration to agents will
be abolished.
Provisions will be introduced with effect from 10 March 1992 to prevent loss
of tax through arrangements involving the payment of rent between connected
persons.
Film expenditure: The tax treatment of film production costs will be amended
for films completed after 10 March 1992. Production costs may be written off
at a flat rate of 33 1/3 per cent starting on completion of the film.
Pre-production costs incurred after 10 March 1992 will be written off as
they are incurred.
Inheritance tax: Most business assets which currently qualify for 50 per
cent relief from inheritance tax will be granted 100 per cent relief from 10
March 1992. Assets which currently qualify for 30 per cent relief will be
granted 50 per cent relief.
The threshold for inheritance tax will be raised from Pounds 140,000 to
Pounds 150,000 from 10 March 1992.
Tax appeals: Procedural rules will be introduced for appeal hearings. There
will be powers to award costs where either party has acted wholly
unreasonably, from 1 April 1993.
Customs and Excise
Car tax: Car tax will be halved from 10 per cent to 5 per cent of the
wholesale price of new cars from 11 March 1992.
Excise duties: Most excise duties will rise from 6 pm on 10 March 1992.
The duties on alcoholic drinks will rise by 4.5 per cent, in line with the
increase in the Retail Prices Index in the year to December 1991.
The duty on unleaded petrol and derv will rise by 4.5 per cent, in line with
the increase in the Retail Prices Index in the year to December 1991.
The duty on leaded petrol will rise by 7.5 per cent.
The duty on cigarettes will rise by about 10 per cent, putting 13p on the
price of a packet of 20 cigarettes. The duty on pipe tobacco will rise by
4.5 per cent and on other tobacco products by 10 per cent.
The rate of general betting duty will be cut from 8 per cent to 7.75 per
cent from 1 April 1992.
Duties on matches and mechanical lighters will be abolished from 1 January
1993.
Members' clubs will be exempt from bingo duty from 3 August 1992.
Vehicle excise duties: Duty on cars, light vans and taxis will rise from
Pounds 100 to Pounds 110 from 11 March 1992. Duty on lorries and most other
vehicles will not change.
Value added tax: The registration threshold will rise from turnover of
Pounds 35,000 to Pounds 36,600 from 11 March 1992, in line with the increase
in the Retail Prices Index in the year to December 1991.
Traders who meet the other conditions for cash accounting (including annual
turnover of Pounds 300,000 or less) will be able to join the scheme from 1
April 1992 even if they owe Customs and Excise up to Pounds 5,000, rather
than a maximum of Pounds 1,000 as at present.
Large VAT payers will be required to make monthly payments on account from
autumn 1992. They will not be required to make monthly returns and may
continue to submit quarterly returns.
The rate of serious misdeclaration penalty will be cut from 20 per cent to
15 per cent on assessments calculated from 11 March 1992.
Penalties will not normally be levied on under-declarations of Pounds 2,000
or less. The maximum rate of default surcharge will be cut from 30 per cent
to 20 per cent from 1 April 1992.
Private taxi firms, self-drive hire firms and driving schools will be able
to reclaim VAT paid on cars purchased for their businesses from 1 August
1992. They will be required to account for VAT on any private use of these
cars and on their resale under the normal VAT rules.
VAT will no longer be charged on the salary forgone when employees are
offered a choice between the private use of a company car or additional
salary, from 1 April 1992.
Business rates
England and Wales: There will be amendments to the transitional arrangements
for properties in England and Wales which face large changes in national
non-domestic rate bills as a result of the 1990 reforms. These changes will
reduce the total rates bill in England and Wales for 1992-93 by 3 1/4 per
cent.
For 1992-93 only, rate bills for properties in transition to higher bills
will not increase in real terms. Instead bills will increase by only 4.1 per
cent, in line with the increase in the Retail Prices Index in the year to
September 1991 used in setting the uprating of business poundages already
announced in November 1991.
New occupiers will be able to inherit the transitional relief due to the
previous occupier, from 11 March 1992.
For properties in transition to lower rate bills, the maximum reduction in
rate bills in real terms for 1992-93 will be 22 per cent for large
properties and 27 per cent for smaller properties.
This is 9 percentage points higher in each case than in 1991-92. All
properties gaining from the 1990 reforms will benefit from fully reduced
bills from 1993-94.
Scotland and Northern Ireland: Scotland and Northern Ireland have different
arrangements for business rates but their total rates bills for 1992-93 will
also be reduced by 3 1/4 per cent.
