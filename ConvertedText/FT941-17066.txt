FT  06 JAN 94 / Observer: Cruellest cut


No wonder Jim Payne, one of the best-known souls in the Lloyd's reinsurance
market, has opted to step down as vice-chairman of Sedgwick Group in March.
For where is he to effect his business? To the best of Observer's knowledge,
nothing dreadful has happened to his immediate surroundings at Sedgwick
Payne, where he was chairman until the end of last year. But his
hairdresser, Parkes, something of an institution just around the corner from
Lloyd's, has caught the Lime Street blight and shut up shop.
This is significant because Payne has been known, when up against a deadline
and unable to raise a particularly crucial underwriter at his desk, to rush
into the barber's brandishing a piece of paper to secure the vital signature
on the multi-million risk between snips.
