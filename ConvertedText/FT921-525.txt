FT  28 MAR 92 / Briefcase, Q&A: Power of attorney


MY MOTHER wishes to give me power of attorney under the 1986 Enduring Powers
of Attorney Act. Please would you let me know an address from which I can
obtain the necessary form and of the court of protection, who I understand
have issued an explanatory leaflet.
The Court of Protection is at Stewart House, 24 Kingsway, London, WC2B 6HD
(tel: 071-269-7000). Forms can be obtained from Law Stationers Company
shops.
No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the
answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as
soon as possible.
