FT  30 JAN 92 / International Company News: Amex advances 72% in quarter


   By MARTIN DICKSON


AMERICAN Express, the US financial services group buffeted by credit card
loan losses, reported a 72 per cent increase in fourth-quarter earnings,
although income at its core cards business dropped by almost two-thirds.
The group reported net income of Dollars 237m, or 47 cents a share, on
revenues of Dollars 6.6bn, compared with income of Dollars 138m, or 28
cents, on Dollars 6.3bn of revenues in the same period of 1990, when it was
hit by particularly heavy losses at its Shearson Lehman investment banking
subsidiary.
The figures were broadly in line with Wall Street expectations.
For the full year, it reported net income of Dollars 789m, or Dollars 1.59 a
share, against Dollars 181m, or 34 cents, in 1990, when it took a Dollars
837m restructuring charge at Shearson.
Over the past year, Shearson's performance has improved, helped by rising
stock and bond markets, while Amex's core Travel Related Services (TRS)
business, which includes its cards and travellers cheques operation, has
been hit by the recession.
The company shocked Wall Street last autumn when it took a Dollars 265m
charge against earnings, including Dollars 155m to cover credit losses,
mainly at its Optima credit card.
TRS's fourth-quarter net income totalled Dollars 81m, down from Dollars 215m
a year ago. Charge volume on its credit cards totalled Dollars 30bn, a 1.3
per cent increase from last year.
For the full year, TRS produced net income of Dollars 396m, down from
Dollars 956m, due to a Dollars 432m post-tax increased provision for credit
losses, Dollars 110m of third-quarter restructuring charges, a Dollars 200m
increase in operating expenses and a Dollars 24m rise in marketing expenses.
Worldwide charge volume totalled Dollars 111bn, unchanged from a year ago,
while the number of establishments accepting the card rose 7.6 per cent to
over 3.5m. Cards in force rose slightly to 36.6m - a drop from past growth
rates which the company said was due to tightened credit procedures and
reduced solicitation.
Shearson reported record income of Dollars 130m in the fourth quarter,
compared with a Dollars 115m net loss a year ago, while the IDS financial
services unit saw profits rise 21 per cent to Dollars 68m.
