FT  22 OCT 92 / International Company News: Chemical Banking surges by 35%


   By ALAN FRIEDMAN


   NEW YORK


HIGHER net interest revenues and an ability to contain the rise in bad debt
provisions helped Chemical Banking, the third-biggest US commercial bank, to
turn in a 35 per cent increase in its third-quarter net profits, to Dollars
282m.
The improved net, which translates into earnings per share of 98 cents,
against 95 cents a year ago, is in line with the better earnings achieved by
Chase Manhattan, another big New York-based bank.
Chemical, formed last year by the merger of Manufacturers Hanover Trust and
Chemical, said its bad debt provisions in the third quarter were Dollars
330m, compared with Dollars 313m a year ago but Dollars 345m for this year's
second quarter.
Net loan write-offs totalled Dollars 330m, against Dollars 307m in the third
quarter of 1991.
Mr John McGillicuddy, Chemical's chairman, said results were helped by a 15
per cent rise in net interest income, to Dollars 1.16bn, by strong trading
profits and improvements in fee-based services.
He forecast a decline in bad debt provisions and non-performing assets
'going forward'. Non-performing assets in the third quarter declined
slightly year-on-year, to Dollars 6.59bn from Dollars 6.66bn.
Mr Walter Shipley, Chemical's president, said the bank's merger-related
cost-cutting programmed was ahead of schedule.
The bank's Tier One risk-based capital ratio was a healthy 7 per cent at the
end of September, up from 5.6 per cent a year ago.
That ratio reflected Dollars 1.7bn in new common equity raised by the issue
of stock last January and by retaining Dollars 447m of earnings generated
during the first nine months of 1992.
For the first nine months of the year, Chemical's net income was Dollars
782m, up by 36 per cent from the same period last year.
