   TAIPEI


Taipei and Beijing have finally settled on a date for a fresh round of
talks, the first since the March 31 murders of 24 Taiwan tourists in eastern
China.
Following weeks of face-saving proposals, the meeting will be held in the
Taiwanese capital Taipei on July 30 between the quasi-official straits
exchange foundation (SEF) and its Chinese counterpart, the association for
relations across the Taiwan straits (Arats).
A sixth round of working-level talks on fishing disputes and repatriation of
illegal immigrants and airline hijackers will be followed by a second round
of meetings between Arats and the SEF.
