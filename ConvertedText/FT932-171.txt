FT  30 JUN 93 / Scots tourism aid put on new footing


   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent


THE GOVERNMENT is to re-organise the way it helps Scotland's tourist
industry, doing away with a structure which critics say is fragmented and
ineffective.
The Scottish Tourist Board will continue to be responsible for marketing
Scotland as a tourist destination and will take over marketing the Highlands
and Islands from Highlands and Islands Enterprise, the development body.
But the tourist board will no longer give financial assistance and advice to
tourism businesses. This will be the responsibility of Scottish Enterprise
and Highlands and Islands Enterprise, the two umbrella development bodies
which operate through a network of local enterprise companies - the
equivalent of the Training and Enterprise Councils in England. The
development bodies already disburse the bulk of official aid to tourist
businesses.
A co-ordinating group to be set up under Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, the
Scottish Office minister, will draw up a national strategic plan.
The Edinburgh-based tourist board will be told to establish by 1995 a
'substantial office' in Inverness, the Highland capital. This is expected to
involve moving about 50 jobs to Inverness. The number of area tourist
boards, which undertake local promotion and assistance, is to be cut from
more than 30 to fewer than 10.
Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, said yesterday government spending on
developing and promoting tourism in Scotland would be about the same - about
Pounds 50m - but the money would be better spent.
