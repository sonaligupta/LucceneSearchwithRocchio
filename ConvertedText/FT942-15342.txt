FT  15 APR 94 / UK Company News: Swallowfield 28% ahead to Pounds 1.63m


Swallowfield, the aerosol and cosmetics manufacturer, announced 28 per cent
growth in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 1.27m to Pounds 1.63m, for the year
to December 31.
The advance was achieved on turnover ahead 23 per cent to Pounds 28.6m
(Pounds 23.2m). Mr Terry Organ, chairman, said that with the current level
of inflation it had been difficult to increase prices and the result
reflected a rise in unit sales and improved efficiency.
Earnings per share rose to 9.6p (7.3p) and a proposed final dividend of 3p
lifts the total from 4.4p to 5.2p.
