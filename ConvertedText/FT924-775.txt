FT  22 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Brokers Whitefriars closed by Bikuben


   By RICHARD WATERS


WHITEFRIARS, the UK stockbroker acquired by Danish savings bank Bikuben in
1990, has been closed, in the process leaving 90 small British and Irish
companies without a proper market in their shares.
Almost all of the 100 companies in which Bikuben-Whitefriars had made a
market are now covered by only one securities house. Unless another market
maker comes forward, they will be forced on to the London Stock Exchange's
recently-created Seats market for illiquid companies.
Cut-backs in small company market making over the past few months by large
securities houses in London have already left 144 companies on Seats.
The closure of Whitefriars, with the loss over the coming weeks of 25 jobs,
follows financial losses over the past three years.
The total cost to Bikuben, including buying the firm, absorbing its losses
and closing it, will come to under Pounds 5m, the bank said.
Following the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between the UK and
Danish securities regulators, Bikuben will carry on its institutional equity
and bond broking business, as well as its private banking operation, from a
newly-created branch in London, rather than a separate company.
