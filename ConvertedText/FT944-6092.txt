FT  30 NOV 94 / Chancellor fails to excite cautious markets


   By Our Markets Staff


Financial markets yesterday gave a lukewarm response to a Budget widely
described as unexceptional.
Good news about the state of UK public finances was tempered by concern that
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, might cut income tax in the run-up to the
next election.
Because the Budget was in line with market expectations there was little
response in terms of price movements. Traders found little fresh information
overall on which to base new business.
Analysts cautioned, however, against attributing falling bond prices to the
Budget, saying that UK markets were taking their lead from Wall Street. A
stronger than expected US consumer confidence report reawakened fears of
higher US interest rates.
UK government bonds fell by more than  1/2 a point on the day, while the
FTSE index rose 14 points to close at 3061.1. Equity prices fell marginally
after the Budget announcement: brokers fear that UK interest rates could
rise after the meeting between the chancellor and the governor of the Bank
of England a week tomorrow. Sterling showed little response to the Budget.
It rose half a pfennig to DM2.4550 after Mr Clarke's speech, before
steadying. Mr Peter Lyon, global strategist at the broker Smith New Court
commented: 'It would be unfair to describe the Budget as boring, but there
was nothing exceptional in it. It was very much as expected, and there is no
reason to alter your view if nothing changes.'
There was a mixed response to the downward revision in the public sector
borrowing requirement. Some observers were disappointed, while others said
it was as good as could be expected. There were also worries that the
chancellor was laying the ground for future tax cuts.
