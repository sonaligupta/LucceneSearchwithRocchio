FT  17 JAN 92 / International Company News: Philips to close US chip factory

PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics group and the world's ninth biggest
semiconductor maker, announced yesterday that it planned to close down a
25-year-old semiconductor factory near Salt Lake City, Utah by the end of
1992.
Production of semiconductors built at the Orem site will be transferred to
other factories in the US, Europe or the Asia Pacific area. The move is part
of Philips' efforts to enhance efficiency in its global semiconductor
business. Signetics, Philips' US chip subsidiary, has manufacturing
facilities in New Mexico and California.
Philips said the closure was a matter of streamlining operations and was not
a response to market conditions.
It will earmark an unspecified sum for transferring, retraining and finding
jobs for the factory's 900 employees. Signetics has a global workforce of
about 6,000 people.
Mr James Dykes, president of Signetics, said the Utah factory, which makes
chips on three and four-inch wafers rather than on the more advanced
six-inch variety, 'has been a workhorse for many years, but by today's
standards is an almost outdated facility'.
