FT  16 JUN 93 / Ukraine president adopts Yeltsin tactic in struggle


   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND


   KIEV


THE Ukrainian president, Mr Leonid Kravchuk, yesterday called for a
referendum on Ukraine's constitutional structure and early parliamentary
elections.
Mr Kravchuk's proposal, which was immediately rejected by parliament but is
scheduled to be put to the vote again today, is in part a reaction to the
political demands of striking coal miners in the Donbass region of eastern
Ukraine.
Like Russia's president, Mr Boris Yeltsin, who was strengthened by Russia's
April referendum, Mr Kravchuk is playing for high stakes. He said he would
interpret a no vote in the proposed ballot, to be held sometime this year,
as a public expression of no confidence and would step down.
However, like Mr Yeltsin, the unpopular Ukrainian leader is gambling on
receiving a public endorsement which would strengthen his hand in the bitter
struggle between the various branches of government in Ukraine.
Mr Kravchuk's nemesis, Mr Leonid Kuchma, the prime minister, also raised the
stakes yesterday, suggesting that he will seek emergency powers over the
economy even greater than those he asked for - and was refused - in May.
Mr Kuchma said that the Ukrainian economy would collapse unless one branch
of government is given nearly absolute control.
