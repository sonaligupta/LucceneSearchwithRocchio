FT  11 NOV 92 / International Company News: The Equitable hit by charge for
change of status


   By NIKKI TAIT


   NEW YORK


THE EQUITABLE, the large but ailing US life insurance company of which
France's Axa now owns a 49 per cent stake, yesterday reported an after-tax
loss of Dollars 35.2m in the three months to end-September.
The third-quarter figure, however, comes after an extraordinary charge of
Dollars 55.6m. The company said this reflected the final expenses of its
recent 'demutualisation' - the complex process of switching from a
policyholder-owned to a shareholder-owned company, with an associated share
flotation.
In the same period of 1991, the after-tax loss was Dollars 220m, after an
Dollars 11.1m extraordinary charge and a Dollars 239.5m deficit from
discontinued operations.
The Equitable said yesterday that profits from continuing operations, before
extraordinary charges, slipped from Dollars 30.6m to Dollars 20.4m in the
third quarter, but stand at Dollars 300,000 for the first nine months of the
year, compared with a deficit of Dollars 146.5m in the same three quarters
of 1991.
After extraordinary charges of Dollars 101.3m - again, demutualisation costs
 -the after-tax loss in the first nine months of 1992 is Dollars 101m.
During the third quarter, insurance operations made an operating profit of
Dollars 16.8m, ahead of investment gains and losses. This compared with a
Dollars 400,000 profit in the same period of 1991. The company said there
were 'strong earnings' in the life and annuity operations, partly offset by
losses on the disability lines.
On the investment services side - which takes in the Donaldson, Lufkin &
Jenrette brokerage business and Alliance Capital Management - after-tax
profits rose strongly to Dollars 47m, compared with Dollars 27.4m in the
same period of 1991.
However, The Equitable registered a Dollars 2.6m after-tax loss on its
insurance investment portfolio. This compared with a Dollars 29.8m gain a
year ago, including the gain on the sale of an insurance subsidiary, and
came after a further Dollars 64.8m after-tax addition to valuation
allowances and asset writedowns.
Last year, The Equitable took a substantial net write-down and increase in
asset valuation allowances, amounting to Dollars 548m, as it attempted to
put its investment portfolio on a more conservative footing.
