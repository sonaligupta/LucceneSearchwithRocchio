FT  23 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia lifts farmers' grain
prices

THE RUSSIAN government yesterday agreed to pay their farmers Rbs60,000
(Dollars 60) a tonne for state grain purchases this year - a rise of
one-third over its previous offer of Rbs45,000 a tonne but well short of the
farmers' demand of Rbs110,000 a tonne. However, Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the
prime minister, said the price should be indexed to inflation, according to
the official news service Itar Tass.
Tass quoted Ms Lira Rozenova, head of the state pricing committee, as saying
that food prices would go up 1.7 times if grain were bought at Rbs50,000 a
tonne and 2.5 to 3 times at Rbs100,000 a tonne.
The government is relatively optimistic on this year's harvest, forecasting
a substantial rise on last year's 106m tonnes. Mr Victor Khlystun, the
agriculture minister, said in Moscow earlier this week that the yield was
higher this year and the harvest might be as high as 110m tonnes.
On government figures, some 2m hectares have been harvested so far, 1m ha
down on the same time last year. So far 7.1m tonnes have been threshed, down
1.7m.
Russia bought some 25m tonnes of grain from abroad last year, and ministers
are hoping that it will be less this year. Mr Khlystun told the cabinet
yesterday that, 'given favourable conditions', purchases should be limited
to soyabeans and maize.
