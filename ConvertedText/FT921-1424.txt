FT  24 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Lamont rejects criticisms of borrowing


   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent


MR NORMAN LAMONT, the chancellor, yesterday rejected suggestions that the
government was borrowing to fi-nance current expenditure and would have to
raise taxes if re-elected.
He said that a report to this effect in The Guardian yesterday was 'complete
nonsense'. Mr Lamont said government spending plans for the coming year
envisaged investment of Pounds 30bn when defined as public-sector asset
creation. This, he said, was larger than the Pounds 28bn that the government
said in its Budget that it would borrow in 1992-93.
Speaking on a visit to Birmingham Mr Lamont insisted that the public sector
borrowing requirement, which the government expects will grow further to
Pounds 32bn in 1993-94, would start to decline after the economy had begun
to recover. The present large PSBR reflected the impact of reduced economic
activity on tax revenues.
He predicted that tax revenues would 'turn round' when the economy recovered
and that public finances would move back towards balance. Britain's
financial position was strong and the tax regime was 'perfectly
sustainable', he added.
Mr Lamont was in Birmingham to launch his party's campaign in the West
Midlands by attacking Labour's taxation plans. Labour would increase the
income tax burden and National Insurance contributions of the more highly
paid members of the car-buying public, while Tory tax benefits in the Budget
would help the car industry.
However, the doubts that surfaced yesterday about the government's finances
clouded the chancellor's message.
