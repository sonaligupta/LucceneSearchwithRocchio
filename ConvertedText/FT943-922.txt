FT  27 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Consistency on prices


   From Mr IAN BYATT


Sir, Peggy Hollinger's article, 'Water company appeals to MMC on price caps'
(September 22) suggests that I have taken a tougher approach with South West
Water as it had the highest charges and price increases since privatisation
in 1989.
The Monopolies and Mergers Commissions will doubtless look at this. I
contend that the methodology I used in setting price limits was applied
fairly and consistently across all companies.
It is not true that I promised South West Water (in 1991 at the time of its
interim determination) price increases after 1995 similar to its current
K-factor of 11 per cent. At that time I had already announced that I would
be resetting all the company price limits from April 1 1995, including South
West Water's, at a periodic review in July 1994. It is only at periodic
reviews that I am able to examine all the issues underlying price limits.
