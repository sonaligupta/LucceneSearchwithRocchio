FT  06 AUG 93 / Observer: Bearding the City


Like a jilted lover who won't give up, the Labour party is trying yet again
to win the affections of a steadfastly sceptical business community. The
high-point of the on-off affair comes in November, when Labour leader John
Smith parades in front of the Confederation of British Industry's annual
conference in Harrogate.
It will be a first for a Labour leader out of power and he must be hoping
his speech, reminiscent of CBI boss Howard Davies' cheeky performance at the
TUC last year, will prove more successful than previous Labour attempts to
woo industry. The job of preaching to the seemingly unconvertible has
exasperated Labour industry and treasury spokesmen, from Roy Hattersley and
Bryan Gould to Gordon Brown and Smith himself.
Indeed, Smith's own, ineffective efforts as shadow chancellor to woo the
City handed Michael Heseltine one of his best Commons put-downs, when he
ridiculed Smith's prawn-cocktail offensive, claiming that 'never have so
many crustaceans died for so little'.
So it comes as no surprise to hear that Robin Cook, Hezza's opposite number,
is already preparing a fall back position if the big boys won't rise to
Labour's bait. He and his colleague Derek Fatchett have set off on a
nationwide tour to sell the party's industry 'green paper'.
But, this time, small businesses are to be singled out for special
attention. Labour reckons the sector has had such a mauling under the Tories
that converts will be ripe for the picking.
But then it thought that before the last election.
