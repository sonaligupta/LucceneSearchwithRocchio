FT  06 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading


   By STEVE THOMPSON


PERSISTENT selling pressure, triggered by the recent big falls in
international bond and equity markets, drove the FT-SE future down to a
discount to the cash market for the first time in many weeks, writes Steve
Thompson.
Turnover in stock index futures was 23,000 contracts - more than double the
usual amount.
Dealers said the December FT-SE future began trading at 3,133 and came under
immediate selling pressure from all the big international trading houses -
as well as independent traders - as the market anticipated a weak opening to
European bourses and another bout of pressure in bond markets around the
world.
By the close, the contract had fallen to 3,072, a discount of around 2
points to the cash market, having dropped to a discount of about 10 points
to the cash market at one point, with sentiment helped at the close by the
steadier showing by Wall Street.
In traded options, activity in the Euro-FTSE accounted for over 5,900 lots,
while Lucas saw 5,243 traded.
