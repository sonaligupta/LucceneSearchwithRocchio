FT  17 JAN 92 / Names at odds over stewards' inquiry


   By JOHN AUTHERS


'ONE doesn't mind going to the races, having a flutter on a horse, and
losing one's money. But one does mind if the horse has been doped,' a
Lloyd's Name said yesterday.
This was a typical reaction. Names generally have reacted positively to the
task force's plans, but resentment continues at the big losses they are
likely to incur as the result of unforeseen claims, particularly on
pollution.
Many Names say that the proposals to allow 'open years' to remain open could
act to stop dissatisfied Names from leaving.
Some were optimistic. Mr David White, a Name and managing director of
discount house Cater Allen, said he thought the cap on liability was of
great psychological importance, and he expected it to tempt many new Names
on to the market.
Mr Clive Scott-Hopkins, a Name who also acts as a financial adviser to other
Names via Towry Law, said that existing members would be tempted to reduce
their level of underwriting. He added: 'I wonder whether a 0.25 per cent fee
is going to be enough, with these unquantifiable pollution claims.
Personally I would be happy to pay 0.5 per cent.'
Mr Scott-Hopkins also foresaw a conflict between working and non-working
Names.
But many Names have not had enough time to study the report in full. The
Association of Lloyd's Names reported that reaction had so far been limited
but positive. It suggested stronger reaction was unlikely until after
Lloyd's had completed its series of worldwide briefings on the report.
Names involved in the Feltrim syndicate, which has suffered big losses, gave
a muted response, but are likely to study the report hard for signs of
implicit support for their position.
