FT  21 NOV 92 / UK Company News: NHL losses hit Pounds 146m but decrease
predicted


   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent


NATIONAL HOME Loans, the centralised mortgage lender whose debt was
restructured this year after it came close to collapse, yesterday declared
increased pre-tax losses for the year to September 30 of Pounds 146.4m,
against Pounds 47.9m.
'We are still alive,' said Mr Jonathan Perry, the group's executive chairman
who took over in February. He predicted a 'significantly reduced loss' for
the current year and a future return to profitability.
The group made provisions to cover loan losses of Pounds 138.5m (Pounds
88.7m). It has been trying to restore earnings by improving payments on
mortgages, and has cut the number of accounts in arrears by three months or
more to 6,130 (7,564).
Net assets at the year end were cut to Pounds 11.2m (Pounds 157.5m). NHL
received Pounds 219.5m (Pounds 335.8m) in interest payments while paying
Pounds 209.1m (Pounds 288.5m) interest on borrowings.
Losses per ordinary share were 141.9p (50.2p). Shares yesterday fell 20 per
cent in value from 3 3/4 p to 3p, and were trading on a wide spread.
The results, and the elimination of distributable reserves, led to it making
no dividend payment on ordinary shares, and passing payment on convertible
preference shares.
In a lengthy chairman's statement, Mr Perry said 36.9 per cent of group
losses were attributable to the National Mortgage Bank (NMB) subsidiary. The
bank is running down its business, and will not require further investment.
The group holds loan notes of Pounds 283.7m (Pounds 326m), and bank loans
and other borrowings of Pounds 1.085bn (Pounds 1.54bn). Mr Perry said the
task of restoring value to shareholders was 'a significant challenge'.
He said the group continued to derive considerable income from Pounds 2.2bn
of mortgage assets held by securitised vehicle companies, most of which were
off balance sheet. These were 'a key component' of future income and value.
The gross mortgage assets under management on September 30 - excluding NMB -
fell to Pounds 2.62bn compared to Pounds 3.1bn a year earlier. The cut
mainly resulted from redemptions of mortgages and sales of repossessed
properties.
