FT  12 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Improved pensions hit John Lewis


   By NEIL BUCKLEY


JOHN LEWIS Partnership, the employee-owned department store and supermarket
group, yesterday disclosed a decline in profits for the fourth successive
year and warned that another year of falling profits was in prospect.
Pre-tax profits for the 12 months to January 30 fell 8 per cent to Pounds
71.4m, although the trading balance - before pension costs - was slightly
higher at Pounds 111.9m, compared with Pounds 111.4m. This was boosted by a
53 weeks rather than 52 weeks trading year.
Mr Stuart Hampson, chairman, said a Pounds 4.8m increase in pension costs,
reflecting recent improvements to pensions, and a Pounds 1.6m rise in
interest charges due to an increase in average borrowings from Pounds 226m
to Pounds 238m, accounted for the pre-tax decline.
Group turnover increased 3 per cent to Pounds 2.36bn (Pounds 2.28bn).
The 22 department stores saw sales drop below the previous year in the first
half. The second period started well, but faltered as consumer confidence
was damaged in September when sterling withdrew from the ERM. Trade picked
up again over Christmas and in January.
For the 102 Waitrose supermarkets, the second half was one of 'exceptional
difficulty', with sales below the previous year in the face of low food
price inflation and competitive pressure, including what Mr Hampson called
'widespread unlawful Sunday trading'.
Mr Hampson said Pounds 28.2m - down from Pounds 30.2m - would be shared
between the 34,000 employee-partners in the form of the company's annual
bonus. The pay-out, representing 8 per cent of annual pay, is the lowest in
percentage terms since 1958-59 when a 7 per cent distribution was made in
preference stock.
'I wish I could tell partners that we had reached the bottom of the trough,
but the year ahead is still far from certain,' Mr Hampson warned.
The 'clouded' economic outlook, together with fierce competition in food
retailing and heavy one-off costs for introducing new technology at
Wait-rose, meant 'the prospect is of yet another year of falling profit,
perhaps even of sharply falling profit,' he added.
