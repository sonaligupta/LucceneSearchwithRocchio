FT  09 JUN 92 / World Trade News: UK to boost exports to N America


   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor


BRITAIN aims to increase its exports to North America by Pounds 3bnby 1995
through a trade campaign to be launched next year, Sir Derek Hornby,
chairman of the British Overseas Trade Board (BOTB), said yesterday.
The campaign aims to lift Britain's share of North America's non-oil imports
by 25 per cent, from 4.3 per cent in 1991 to more than 5 per cent or Pounds
16bn. It will be at the core of an export promotion strategy targeting a
total of 54 markets, half of them in the priority areas of western Europe,
North America and east Asia.
Sir Derek was presenting the annual report of the BOTB, combined for the
first time with the board's plan for shaping the government's export
promotion programme for the year ahead. Mr Michael Heseltine, minister for
trade and industry and president of the BOTB, said he was 'reviewing all
factors that add up to the competitiveness of UK industry'. He warned of
signals that UK industry was 'overpaying itself', but did not expect to find
any 'quick fixes' to boosting export performance.
In western Europe, which accounted for almost 65 per cent of UK exports in
1991, the government plans to target commercial environmental technology and
car components, with the most initiatives in France, Germany, the
Netherlands and Sweden. In Japan, where the UK accounts for just 2.2 per
cent of imports, the 'Priority Japan' campaign continues to focus on
'perhaps the best business prospect among the OECD markets'. The rest of the
Pacific region is also targeted.
