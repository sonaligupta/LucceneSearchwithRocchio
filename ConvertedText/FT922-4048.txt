FT  08 JUN 92 / International Company News: Modification in Foster's merger
likely


   By REUTER


   SYDNEY


SA BREWING Holdings may have to modify its plans for a ADollars 6bn
(USDollars 4.61bn) merger with Foster's Brewing Group after receivers and
managers took control of Foster's largest shareholder, International Brewing
Investments (IBI), Reuters reports from Sydney.
Broken Hill Proprietary (BHP) last week appointed receivers and managers to
IBI, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mr John Elliott's International Brewing
Holdings. IBI's principal asset is a 32 per cent shareholding in Foster's.
Mr Ross Wilson, SA Brewing chief executive, said he expected to have
discussions with BHP next week.
'I think what BHP has done has clearly made the transition of the merger
that much more simpler because, in fact, it's now resolved or partly
resolved the IBH problem,' Wilson said in an interview.
IBH owns 37.75 per cent of Foster's, a stake worth about half its debt of
ADollars 3bn owed to bankers and BHP. The stake was built up when IBH tried
to take over Foster's in 1989.
Under SA Brewing's proposal, SA Brewing shareholders would receive one share
in the newly merged company for every one SA Brewing share held, and
Foster's shareholders would receive one share for every 1.5.
