FT  29 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Firmer futures market
helps Nikkei recover


   By EMIKO TERAZONO and FARHAN BOKHARI


   TOKYO, ISLAMABAD


HEAVY buying in the futures market helped the Nikkei average register its
first gain in three days, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average closed 53.30 better at 15,426.64. The index fell to
15,200.82 in the early morning, following Monday's decline to another
six-year low, but covering of short positions in the futures market prompted
support in the afternoon, taking the Nikkei to the day's high of 15,510.54.
Volume shrank, however, from 227m shares to 170m as investors failed to
participate and the overall market remained weak. Declines still led rises
at the close by 667 to 283, with 143 issues unchanged. The Topix index of
all first section stocks ended 3.53 easier at 1,190.41, and in London the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index shed 1.54 to 936.18.
Traders said the improvement in the Nikkei was technical, and institutional
investors cited the risk of a further fall in share prices as their reason
for remaining on the sidelines.
Mr Chris Newton at James Capel commented: 'Investors feel that the (discount
rate) cut was too little, too late. Mr Shiomichi Kawamoto at Nikko Research
Institute said institutional investors would have to see a substantial rise
in share prices before deciding to participate. He added that since Japanese
individuals tended to place funds in bank savings during an economic
downturn, the rate cut had added to worries about a delay in an economic
rebound.
Dealers traded in speculative theme stocks. Meiji Milk Products, the most
active issue of the day, dipped Y2 to Y892 and Taiyo Fishery lost Y3 to
Y431.
Banks firmed on bargain hunting. Industrial Bank of Japan gained Y20 to
Y1,620 and Fuji Bank also Y20 to Y1,260. High-technology blue chips were
narrowly mixed: Fujitsu firmed Y1 to Y581 on bargain hunting.
Nippon Housing Loan, facing an increasing number of bad loans, improved Y9
to Y174 as rumours that the Finance Ministry would work out a restructuring
programme sparked short-covering. The issue had suffered its eighth
consecutive fall on Monday, due to worries about its dispute with tax
officials.
In Osaka, the OSE average regained 155.65 to 17,576.68 in volume of 19m
shares.
Roundup
TOKYO'S mild improvement had little effect on most markets in the Pacific
Basin, where Hong Kong was an isolated bright feature.
HONG KONG jumped 2.1 per cent largely on a technical rebound, ending at the
day's highs and recouping Monday's losses. The Hang Seng index finished
118.24 ahead at 5,782.63 after selling around midday had temporarily pared
strong early gains. Turnover fell to HKDollars 2.61bn from HKDollars 3.43bn.
Buying centred on blue chips but with some interest in second line
industrial stocks. Hong Kong Land advanced 40 cents to HKDollars 13.70 and
Sun Hung Kai Properties HKDollars 1.35 to HKDollars 31.25. Playmates
International put on 20 cents to HKDollars 3.45 and Wong's International
7.50 cents to HKDollars 2.15.
SEOUL rose briefly in the morning on speculation that the central bank would
grant a loan to three ailing investment trusts, but retreated to close lower
for a third consecutive session. The index lost a net 3.03 to 514.45 in
turnover of Won129.9bn (Won121.14bn).
KARACHI recorded further losses after an announcement by opposition parties
of a series of anti-government demonstrations, beginning tomorrow, added to
the political uncertainty, writes Farhan Bokhari in Islamabad.
The KSE-100 index weakened 23.99 to 1,360.95.
SINGAPORE rallied from intraday lows on selective bargain hunting but still
closed down on the day. The Straits Times Industrial index was finally off
9.81 at 1,412.53.
TAIWAN extended early losses and the weighted index finished at an 18-month
low. The index fell 49.12 to 3,959.10 in moderate turnover of TDollars
22.1bn, against TDollars 23.94bn.
The heavily weighted financial sector declined 1.4 per cent on reports that
the government had set a low offer price of TDollars 40 for its planned
sales of shares in Chiao Tung Bank and Farmers Bank later this year.
AUSTRALIA was only marginally easier after trading dominated by Pasminco, as
CRA and North Broken Peko's after-hours' sale on Monday was passed on to
other buyers. The All Ordinaries index closed 0.9 down at 1,605.4.
NEW ZEALAND's NZSE-40 capital index fell 1.2 per cent, mainly as a result of
sharp falls in Telecom, Fletcher Challenge and Carter Holt Harvey. The index
slid 19.08 to 1,531.42 in volume of just NZDollars 16m.
BANGKOK's SET index slipped 2.37 to 732.57 in moderate turnover of Bt5.24bn.
Thai Airways receded Bt2 to Bt53.50 on institutional selling.
