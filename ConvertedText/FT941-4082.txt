FT  12 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Plan to slash your tax bill - The
best ways to make the most of your allowances


   By ANDREW RADICE


Every year, the Treasury collects a multi-million pound bonus from taxpayers
who do not make full use of allowances and reliefs to which they are
entitled. The main areas in which you can reduce your tax bill are:
Income tax
Everyone has a personal allowance of at least Pounds 3,445 for the 1993/94
tax year (more for older taxpayers). On top of this, the first Pounds 2,500
is taxed at 20 per cent and the next Pounds 21,200 at 25 per cent; above
this, you are in the 40 per cent bracket. Families should make sure
income-producing assets are in the right hands to take maximum advantage of
allowances and the 20 and 25 per cent rate bands.
Married couples can elect - on form 17, obtainable from their local tax
office - for income from jointly-held property to be divided between husband
and wife in accordance with their beneficial interests in the property. This
election is effective only from the date the form is signed, however, so it
is worth thinking about now for 1994/95.
A word of warning on gifts to children: if a parent puts capital into trust
for a child, only the first Pounds 100 of income is regarded as the child's
for tax purposes; the rest is treated as that of the parent. But if a
grandparent puts capital into trust for a grandchild, the income is the
child's for tax purposes (this is also good inheritance tax planning).
The tax relief on the married couple's allowance (Pounds 1,720) is worth
only 20 per cent in 1994/95, so it will not be worth transferring this to
the wife unless the husband's income is below the threshold. Couples for
whom this transfer will be an advantage should get a form 18 from the
Revenue and return it by April 5.
Married couples with a joint mortgage have until April 5 to elect for the
interest paid in the 1992/93 tax year and thereafter to be allocated between
them in whatever proportion they choose. Normally, this is the only way in
which you can get tax relief on a second mortgage.
If they do not make this election, the interest is divided equally between
them. But, unlike Miras, this interest attracts relief at the top marginal
rate of tax of the person to whom it is allocated. This can make a very
considerable difference to a couple where one spouse pays tax at 40 per cent
and the other at 20 or 25 per cent.
If you have had a bank deposit of Pounds 50,000 or more which pays interest
gross for a number of years, it might well be to your advantage to close it
and re-open it by April 5. Your tax assessment for the 1993/94 tax year
(which you should have paid on January 1) will have been based on the
interest credited to your account in 1992/93. If you close your account now,
your assessment for 1993/94 will instead be based on the interest credited
in 1993/94. Because of the sharp fall in interest rates over the period, you
should get a repayment of tax.
You do, however, need also to look at your tax assessment for 1992/93, which
will be based on the interest credited in 1991/92. If you close your
account, the Revenue could revise the 1992/93 assessment to the amount you
actually received in 1992/93. Since interest rates generally were lower in
1992/93 than 1991/92, the Revenue normally will not seek to revise the
1992/93 assessment. But you should look at the facts of your own case before
acting.
The scope for employees to reduce their tax bills is limited. It is worth
bearing in mind that the tax drops by a third if you drive more than 2,500
business miles in your company car by April 5. If your employer is unwilling
to send you on the necessary business trip, you could remind him that his
own National Insurance contribution on your car also goes down by a third.
If you are considering paying additional voluntary contributions (AVCs) into
a pension scheme, do so by April 5 if you want tax relief against your
income for 1993/94. If, however, you expect your income to rise considerably
in the next tax year and you will pay tax at 40 per cent rather than 25,
then it could make sense to defer payment of the AVCs until after April 5.
The contributions will be invested in the fund for almost as long and they
will have enjoyed tax relief at a higher rate.
Contributors to personal pension plans should also look at their position
before April 5. This is the last day for paying a premium which is to be
treated as paid in the 1992/93 tax year, so reducing the tax bill for that
year. Any relief still unused from 1987/88 will no longer be available after
that date.
Capital gains tax
You will know more after March 26 when you have finished reading the Weekend
FT series by Richard Chant and Alan Sugden. But there will be only five
working days left in the tax year after then, so here are some points for
those who want to act now.
Everyone has a tax-free CGT allowance of Pounds 5,800 for the tax year
1993/94; this cannot be carried forward. Investors should aim to bed and
breakfast (ie, sell and re-purchase) shares which are showing gains, thus
using up the allowance and increasing the cost to be used in future sales.
Transfers of assets between husbands and wives are tax-free. Since CGT is
payable at an investor's top marginal rate of income tax, it makes sense
first to use both spouses' allowances of Pounds 5,800 and then to route
sales through the spouse with the lower rate of tax.
You should take care to ensure that the paperwork is in order if you are
thinking of transferring assets before sale. In particular, the sale
proceeds should not find their way back to the spouse who is supposed to
have given them away.
If you are already over the CGT threshold for 1993/94 and are about to sell
an asset with a large gain, doing this after April 5 means you will defer
payment of the tax until December 1 1995. Also, if you are over the
threshold, consider if you can reduce your bill by making a negligible value
claim before April 5.
Inheritance tax
This is levied at 40 per cent on a person's estate on death although the
first Pounds 150,000 is exempt. You can reduce your estate by giving away
assets; providing you live seven years afterwards, no IHT will be due on
them. You can also give away up to Pounds 3,000 each tax year and the gift
will be entirely tax-free; if you do not use up this allowance in a year,
the unused part is carried forward for another year.
In addition, you can give away up to Pounds 250 each year to as many people
as you like. Thus, if you did not make any gifts in 1992/93, you can give
away up to Pounds 6,000 by April 5 this year; this will be ignored for IHT
purposes. Bear in mind, however, that CGT is payable on gifts of portfolio
investments to your children.
Value added tax
Unless you are planning to move house, pre-pay domestic electricity and gas
bills before the 8 per cent VAT is introduced on April 1.
Investments
You can put up to Pounds 9,000 each tax year into personal equity plans  -
Pounds 6,000 into a general Pep and Pounds 3,000 into a single company Pep.
Income and capital gains are tax-free, so the only charges are those of the
fund manager.
Other tax-free products include National Savings certificates; the 41st
issue pays 5.40 per cent, which is equivalent to 9 per cent gross for a 40
per cent taxpayer.
Remember . . .
If you were not sent a tax return for 1992/93, but had a new source of gross
income or a capital gain on which tax is due, make sure to tell the Revenue
by April 5 to avoid a penalty.
