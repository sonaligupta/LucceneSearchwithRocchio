FT  20 JUL 94 / Labour promise on water disconnection


A Labour government would prevent the privatised water companies cutting off
supplies to domestic premises for non-payment of bills, Mr Chris Smith,
shadow environment minister, pledged yesterday.
He told the Commons that Labour would also impose a tougher regulatory
regime to curb excessive increases in charges and would not allow the
compulsory introduction of meters for domestic users.
A Labour motion calling for a tougher regulatory regime for water that 'puts
the public first' was defeated by a government majority of 34 (291-257).
