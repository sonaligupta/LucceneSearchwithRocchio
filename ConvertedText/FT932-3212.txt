ROTOREX, the biggest US compressor manufacturer, plans to build a Dollars
40m joint venture plant in Shenzhen, southern China's Special Economic Zone.
The company expects to sign a formal agreement next month with a Shenzhen
air-conditioning factory.
'We're completing feasibility studies,' said Mr Stewart Pei, vice-president
of Rotorex, 'but we're certainly turning our attention from the US, our old
market that is saturated, to China, a new market with a huge potential.'
Rotorex's Shenzhen plant would produce 1.5m compressors a year. The
Maryland-based company also plans to sell 200,000 compressors, worth Dollars
20m, to China this year.
'We've licenced three air-conditioner manufacturers in China,' said Mr Pei,
'but we want to do more.' The three plants with Rotorex technology are in
Nanjing, Guangzhou and Zhuhai, in China's booming southern coastal region.
As living standards have improved in recent years, sales of air-conditioners
have grown steadily. China has now 177 home air-conditioner plants
producing, in 1992, 1.52m sets, 155 per cent more than the previous year.
More such plants are emerging across the country.
China imports 1.5m compressors a year, mostly from Japan and the US.
