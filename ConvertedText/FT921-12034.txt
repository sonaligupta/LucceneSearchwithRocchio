FT  29 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Volvo/Procordia


Aside from Volvo chairman Pehr Gyllenhammer and Procordia chief executive
Soren Gyll, it is hard to find anyone with a good word to say about their
ambitious weekend merger proposal. Yesterday's rejection of the deal by
Sweden's privatisation commission - on grounds both of price and industrial
logic - will have thus come as little surprise to investors.
Though the odds are against it, the chances of a successful renegotiation
cannot be ruled out. The government has left the door open, and Mr
Gyllenhammer is a man not easily denied. Selling Volvo's stake in Procordia
 -an alternative solution to the company's cash flow problems - would
represent an embarrassing climbdown for him in the light of the much grander
vision he has just outlined. Admittedly, the state would hardly relish
swapping its shares in Procordia for a less marketable and less highly-rated
stake in a conglomerate Volvo. But the agreement over Procordia which the
politicians cite works both ways. To pursue the privatisation route, they
will surely need the consent of the company's other large shareholder.
The shares of both companies will no doubt continue to reflect the
uncertainty. A prolonged vacuum might encourage further profit-taking in
Volvo, whose price has been strong of late on hopes that the cost-cutting
programme will soon show through to the bottom line.
