FT  22 DEC 92 / Observer: Hard cheese


A most un-Swiss row is boiling up between the olympian Union Bank of
Switzerland and its largest shareholder, BK Vision, an investment trust
formed last year by Martin Ebner's maverick Zurich securities house, BZ
Bank.
UBS threw down the gauntlet at the weekend by announcing that its board
would not renominate to its ranks Christoph Blocher, the feisty right wing
industrialist-politician who led the triumphant campaign last month against
Switzerland joining the European Economic Area.
Blocher's sin, the bank hastened to clarify, was not his opposition to the
EEA. His silencing of UBS chief executive Robert Studer at a public meeting
during the EEA referendum campaign was also irrelevant.
It was his alleged advocacy of government regulation of mortgage interest
rates and of bringing the Swiss central bank under parliamentary control
that rankled the bosses at the country's largest bank.
What is the connection between Blocher and BK Vision? None directly, but
Blocher and Ebner are known to be close business associates. And Ebner, with
nearly 4 per cent of UBS voting stock behind him, likes to talk about
shareholder rights and the importance of having dissent on company boards.
Blocher has kindly prepared the ground for his friend. 'I am not prepared to
stand down voluntarily,' he says defiantly.
