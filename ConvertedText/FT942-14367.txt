FT  20 APR 94 / Business Air Travel (16): Charter may be good deal at Pounds
30,000 / A look at the advantages of hiring an aircraft instead of going by
scheduled flight


   By DAVID BOGGIS


Thirty thousands pounds spent over four days on hiring a jet and its crew
may sound like a lot of money.
But, say the charter operators, it becomes worth it as soon as you have two
or more destinations to combine within a day, or whenever the place you need
to get to is a little away from the main scheduled airline routes.
The Business Air Centre, London, is one of a small handful of charter
brokers that exists to put executive travellers in touch with the aircraft
operators. Ms Janice Hahn, one of BAC's directors, says: 'Charter becomes
cost-effective as soon as you take 10 people - or even half a dozen - from
London to Paris and back.'
Business for BAC has been strong in recent months. The Pounds 30,000 quoted
by Ms Hahn was the centre's fee for chartering a 16-seat Canadair Challenger
twin-jet executive on a flight that ran:
London, Paris, Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Frankfurt, Milan, Glasgow, Edinburgh
and back to London Heathrow.
The trip took four days. The Challenger came with a crew of two pilots and
one stewardess, and, Ms Hahn said: 'Full complimentary first-class meals and
bar.'
In principle, a group of business people could have booked the flight on
scheduled airlines. But schedules tend to involve many changes of airline,
and rely on precise time-keeping.
Another example quoted by BAC is a charter, booked - as was the previous
example - in February 1994, from Paris to Barcelona, Verona, Paris, Esbjerg
(Denmark), Brussels and back to Paris. The round trip, in a 10-seater
Dassault Falcon 20 - which has a somewhat smaller cabin than the Challenger
 -took two days and cost Pounds 18,000.
British Airways welcomed the challenge of meeting - or improving on - the
charter operators' costs while using scheduled flights. Replicating the
Falcon flight to Esbjerg and other points proved difficult, though.
BA successfully fitted the trip into two days on schedules, but found that
the Barcelona-Verona leg would entail a diversion via Rome, and
Paris-Esbjerg would be via Copenhagen. Only the charter can fly direct.
On price, BA was able to quote Pounds 1,264.60, business class, making the
airline itinerary cheaper as well.
For a theoretical flight carrying six people from Heathrow to Frankfurt,
Rome and Paris, then back to Heathrow, BA quoted a fare of Pounds 534.30 a
head and demonstrated that the itinerary could be fitted into a day, even on
schedules.
What could not be done was to keep to the same airline throughout. Assuming
an 07.40 start, the flyers could reach Frankfurt by BA at 10.15; catch
Alitalia to Rome at 11.55, arriving at 13.45; leave Rome at 15.35 to arrive
in Paris at 17.40; then leave Paris at 20.30 to return to Heathrow at 20.40.
For the same itinerary, BAC suggested a Learjet at a cost of Pounds 8,000.
Business class check-in, assuming hand luggage only, is reckoned as 20
minutes for the schedules. Ms Hahn quotes 10 minutes as normal for charters.
There would also be passport checks, so that the time available for a
meeting at Frankfurt would be just over an hour, assuming that flights
arrived and left on time.
BA also points out that charter aircraft may not necessarily be able to get
landing permission at Heathrow, with its intense pressure on slots.
That objection echoes concerns voiced by Mr Derek Leggett, chief executive
of the Business Aircraft Users Association, which represents corporate
aircraft operators in the UK. His members' access to gateway airports such
as Heathrow is, he says, 'getting progressively more difficult each year'.
Ms Hahn points out that, in the example quoted, the Challenger flight
actually had no difficulty in getting a slot at Heathrow in February.
Passports, she says, are still required between European Union countries,
but formalities can be minimised. BAC will take on the task of collecting
travellers' passport details and passing them on to the destination
airfields. The charter flight will avoid crowded airline terminals and go
instead to the general aviation block.
Charter charges normally include flying time only. Only if, say, the hire
period ranges over a week, with two non-flying days, does the hirer incur a
daily charge for the aircraft.
For shorter trips, a twin-turboprop such as the Beech King Air can compete
on cost and even on time with the jets. The pressurised King Air, which
flies at jet altitudes, can carry 10 people from London to Paris and back
within a day.
BAC, Ms Hahn says, has no 'typical business customer'. The hirers on the
Challenger and Falcon flights were financial executives. Nor does BAC have a
'typical aircraft type'. Models chartered have included the Piper Chieftain
 -a twin-prop, unpressurised 10-seater - on a round trip from London to
Orleans, France - and the Lockheed TriStar, an airliner that can seat 350
people.
Another advantage of charter is that the operator has a wider choice of
destination airfield. Mr Trevor King, commercial manager of Magec Aviation
at Luton Airport, points out that there are many more airfields that can
accommodate a business flight than are served by scheduled airlines.
Magec is a division of GEC-Marconi and has extensive experience of operating
a fleet of six British Aerospace 125 jets capable of seating eight to 12
passengers. One example that Mr King quotes is that of a client who needed
to fly seven executives from East Midlands to Kiev, a mission carried out
more easily than by schedule.
The value of charter, Mr King says, is determined by the value of the
passenger's time. The stress is less when you charter, he says. 'It's a more
restful way of travelling. You can pick your own schedule.'
Clients can hold business meetings in the air, or work on documents more
comfortably than on a schedule. Luton's executive wing has a conference
room, so that time can be saved when business partners meet at the airport.
Many big airports worldwide have similar facilities.
Depending on aircraft type, also, business meetings have been held aboard
the jet while on the ground. Privacy can be assured, which is another
advantage.
The more valuable the executive's time, the more benefit the company gains
from having the use of its own aircraft - and experience during the
recession has shown that the more companies sell off the corporate aircraft,
the more the demand for charter has grown. That Pounds 30,000 comes to look
less like expenses and more like an investment.
