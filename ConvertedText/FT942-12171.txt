FT  30 APR 94 / Briefcase, Q&A: Employee share scheme


I am confused over aspects of the employee share option scheme. 1. With
save-as-you-earn contracts, is indexation applied from the date of exercise
of the option or the original date of grant? The price used would be that at
the date of grant.
2. With executive share options, a nominal sum is paid on the grant of the
option but the exercise may be three to seven years after grant. Is
indexation applied from the date of exercise?
3. With profit-sharing schemes, shares granted are not the employee's
saleable property until the expiry of five years from the grant, when the
share certificate is provided. Is indexation applied from the date of the
grant rather than the date of issue of the share certificate?
1. The cost of the option (a nominal sum, generally) is indexed from the
grant of the option. The exercise price is indexed from the day of exercise.
2. Yes. The rules are the same as for Saye options.
3. Indexation runs from the day of the grant.
