FT  28 APR 94 / UK Company News: S Jerome helped by textiles turnround


A turnround in its continuing textiles business helped S Jerome & Sons
(Holdings) report sharply lower pre-tax losses of Pounds 404,000 for 1993,
compared with Pounds 1.56m previously.
The West Yorkshire-based spinner and weaver suffered a Pounds 750,000 charge
related to the resolution of the dispute over the sale of its electronics
subsidiary.
Mr Alan Jerome, chairman, said that for the continuing business the
operating profit before interest had risen from Pounds 82,000 to Pounds
704,000 and net interest paid had fallen to Pounds 358,000 (Pounds 468,000).
The continuing textiles business turned its pre-tax loss of Pounds 386,000
into a Pounds 346,000 profit. Sales rose 18 per cent to Pounds 25.3m (Pounds
21.4m).
A final dividend of 0.3p makes a total of 0.5p (nil) for the year. Losses
per share worked through at 4.7p (21p).
A Pounds 750,000 capital expenditure programme is planned this year, to be
spread across all activities.
Mr Jerome said the higher levels of activity seen in 1993 had continued in
the first quarter of the current year. He was cautiously optimistic that
further improvements in performance would be achieved this year.
