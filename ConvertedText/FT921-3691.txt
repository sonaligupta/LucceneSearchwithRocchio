FT  13 MAR 92 / Rise in sales of new homes reported


   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent


MINISTERS anxious for evidence of the long-awaited upturn in the economy
will today take comfort from a report suggesting sales activity in the
housing market is beginning to show a marked improvement.
The House Builders' Federation said a recovery in sales experienced in
London and the south-east in January had started to spread to the rest of
the country.
Mr David Holliday, federation president, said there was positive evidence
that purchaser interest in new homes was being converted into sales.
The federation report is based on responses from 41 of Britain's biggest
building companies, which together account for about half of new house
sales.
In January 80 per cent of builders reported improved sales compared with
January last year. The figure rose to 84 per cent in February. Nearly half
of the respondents said February sales had jumped by more than 25 per cent.
