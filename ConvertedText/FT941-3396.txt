FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Likely Pounds 60m tag on Robert Wiseman


   By JAMES BUXTON


Robert Wiseman Dairies, the Scottish liquid milk processor and distributor,
yesterday issued the pathfinder prospectus for the institutional placing
which should lead to it obtaining a stock market listing by the end of the
month.
The placing, by Panmure Gordon, should raise between Pounds 15m and Pounds
16m, leaving 75 per cent of the company in family hands. It is likely to
value the company at about Pounds 60m.
The terms of the placing will be announced on March 22.
Robert Wiseman concentrates on supplying branded milk in cartons to stores
in Scotland and is expanding in the north of England from a base in
Manchester.
In the 39 weeks to January 1 1994 turnover was Pounds 44.26m and pre-tax
profit was Pounds 4.25m.
About half the placing will finance a milk processing plant in Manchester
while the rest will be to complete the recent purchase of Mackie's dairy
near Aberdeen and future acquisitions.
