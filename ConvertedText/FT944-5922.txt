FT  01 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Phantom extras on the hotel bill


   From Ms LESLEY ABDELA


Sir, I do not know if other FT readers have minor cautionary tales of
working in the transitional states of the former Soviet Union and its
satellites, but it would be helpful to be told about the latest scams in
operation there.
So far, mine are only minor (I have not yet visited Moscow) in visiting
central Europe to conduct courses for future women leaders, for the British
Council/Foreign Office Know-How Fund/Harvard University/Undip. I would
thoroughly recommend visitors check out of their hotel and pay their bill
with at least half an hour to spare, to haggle over what exciting items turn
up on the account.
At the Novotel Europa in Sofia this month I discovered I had made phantom
calls to about five other countries, presumably in my sleep, as I certainly
did not during my waking hours, and I seemed to have developed a very large
appetite for eating several breakfasts and dinners at the same time.
Because I had to get to the airport, I paid and hared off. My feeling is
someone was making a nice income charging an imaginatively-disguised
desk-clerk tip in the bill.
