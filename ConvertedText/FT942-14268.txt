FT  21 APR 94 / Banks 'failing to act' on complaints


   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU


Banks and building societies record customer complaints but do little to
improve their procedures as a result, according to a survey.
Ms Rhoda James and Ms Mary Seneviratne, writing in Consumer Policy Review,
say that of the 13 building societies and 21 banks surveyed, most hold
statistics on customer complaints.
While the majority of building societies said they made practical changes as
a result of the complaint, only a minority of banks did so. 'That is clearly
disappointing and leads one to question why efforts are made to record
complaints in such detail if they are then to have such little impact,' say
the authors.
Ombudsman decisions also have a limited impact, with few institutions
circulating the results of decisions among their staff. Only two building
societies and five banks had ever changed policy or procedure as a result.
However one benefit of the ombudsman scheme has been to formalise the
complaints procedure.
