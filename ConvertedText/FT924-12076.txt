FT  22 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Matra, Hachette merger details

MMB, the French holding company controlled by Mr Jean-Luc Lagardere,
yesterday announced the terms of the financial arrangements for the proposed
merger between Matra, the defence electronics concern, and Hachette, one of
France's leading media groups.
Mr Lagardere, who chairs the three companies, first announced plans for the
surprise merger of Matra and Hachette in May. The terms are 11 Hachette
shares for every five held in Matra.
Hachette's shares were suspended at FFr129 and Matra at FFr178 pending the
announcement of the merger terms. Based on these prices, Hachette is
capitalised at FFr2.54bn and Matra at FFr4.69bn.
The announcement of the merger terms comes at a time of renewed speculation
that Havas, another force in French media, was the architect of a
share-buying raid on Hachette earlier this month.
A leading French newspaper yesterday reported that Havas, which had
previously denied buying Hachette shares, had bought a stake of up to 4 per
cent in an attempt to press Mr Lagardere into selling Europe 1, the radio
station.
Hachette's financial plight was one of the catalysts for the merger.
Hachette, which recently reported that its stayed in the red with a net loss
of FFr39.3m (Dollars 7.62m) in the first half of this year, has been hit by
the collapse of La Cinq, the French TV station in which it was managing
shareholder.
