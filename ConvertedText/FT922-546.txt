FT  26 JUN 92 / International Company News: Banacci postpones Dollars 1.4bn
global stock offering


   By PATRICK HARVERSON


   NEW YORK


BANACCI, the Mexican holding company which owns the country's biggest bank,
indefinitely postponed its Dollars 1.4bn global offering of stock yesterday
due to unfavourable conditions in Mexican and international equity markets.
The offering, which would have been the second biggest ever by a Mexican
company, was suspended because Banacci was not willing to sell its stock at
its currently low price. Banacci shares, trading in Mexico yesterday at
17,500 pesos, have fallen 15 per cent since the beginning of the deal.
Banacci shares have fallen amid a major collapse in the Mexico stock market,
triggered by fears that the telephone workers' union would sell its large
stake in Telmex, the telecommunications giant and the biggest company in
Mexico.
The Banacci offering, led by Goldman Sachs from New York and co-led by SG
Warburg in London, initially consisted of around 220m L shares, with each
American depositary sHare and global depositary share equal to four L
shares.
The financial group had hoped to raise as much as Dollars 1.4bn from the
issue, to fund expansion of its banking operations within Mexico.
