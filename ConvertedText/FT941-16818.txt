FT  07 JAN 94 / International Company News: Portugal rejects bid for BPSM


   By REUTER


   LISBON


The Portuguese Cabinet has rejected a bid by Banco Comercial Portugues to
buy state-owned Banco Pinto e Sotto Mayor, the government said after
yesterday's weekly cabinet meeting, Reuter reports from Lisbon.
BCP was the sole bidder for an 80 per cent stake in BPSM, one of Portugal's
largest banks, when it was put up for privatisation last year.
However, the Cabinet statement said: 'The jury (which assessed the bid)
proposed rejection of the proposal on the grounds that the necessary
conditions for it to be accepted had not been met.'
Banking sources said BCP offered less than Es14bn (Dollars 81.4m) for BPSM,
well below the government's minimum asking price of Es44bn.
Officials said Banco Bilbao Vizcaya was officially discouraged from bidding
by the Portuguese government because it did not want to see another leading
Portuguese bank pass under Spanish control.
Banking sources said BPSM failed to excite wider interest because it was
heavily over-staffed and under-capitalised and needed to make Es70bn of
provisions for its pension fund over the next two years in order meet legal
requirements.
The centre-right government's rejection of BCP's bid for BPSM was widely
expected. Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, prime minister, must decide whether to
launch a public competition for the sale of BPSM or sell it off through
direct negotiations.
The bank's net profit fell to Es1.03bn in 1992 from Es2.07bn in 1991, but
banking sources said it was expected to improve in 1993.
