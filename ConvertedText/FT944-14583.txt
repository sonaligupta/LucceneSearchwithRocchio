FT  22 OCT 94 / Ukraine to meet reform deadline


   By MATTHEW KAMINSKI

Ukraine will initiate a series of tough macroeconomic reform steps, possibly
as early as today, to meet Wednesday's deadline set by the International
Monetary Fund to release a first Dollars 360m (Pounds 227.8m) credit to aid
the country's transition to a market economy.
The two most important measures involve liberalising wholesale and energy
prices and unifying the country's myriad exchange rates. These reforms, the
most radical since independence, would be the first implemented under
President Leonid Kuchma's western-tailored programme to overhaul the
country's economy.
According to Mr Vladimir Naumenko, deputy economics minister, Mr Vitali
Masol, the conservative prime minister hostile to reform, signed on
Wednesday night nine decrees liberalising prices and trade, indexing
pensions and wages and shoring up the social safety net.
Mr Naumenko added that the National Bank yesterday finalised plans to unify
the exchange rates. The decrees, likely to reassure western donors, mark a
rare consensus within Ukraine's government.
Mr Masol signed the decrees under pressure from Mr Kuchma despite his
criticism this week of plans to raise bread prices seven-fold, cut the
budget deficit to 10 per cent of GDP and unify exchange rates.
The finalising of the decrees will mean that Mr Kuchma will carry a stronger
hand to Canada next week when he urges IMF, World Bank and G7 finance
officials to help Ukraine cover a Dollars 600m balance of payments gap for
the fourth quarter and come up with about Dollars 5.5bn in assistance to
ease the economic transition.
