FT  20 APR 94 / Observer: Fans in Spain


Spain's Repsol oil company is sounding defensive over the choice of Ronaldo
Schmitz for its new international advisory board. Schmitz's recent claim to
fame is, of course, as supervisory board chairman of Metallgesellschaft, the
German company that teetered on the brink of collapse after dropping DM2.3bn
on oil futures.
Repsol invited him to join several months ago on the grounds of his
experience in the chemical industry and as a board member of Deutsche Bank -
'not as an oil specialist'. Schmitz does speak Spanish, and headed BASF's
Barcelona subsidiary in the mid-1970s.
The new board, which includes Cookson chairman Bob Malpas and the Catalan
head of Nestle's food division Ramon Masip, has so far met only once.
Schmitz, as it happens, was unable to attend since he was at a pressing
meeting - with Metallgesellschaft.
