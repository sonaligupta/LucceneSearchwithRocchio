FT  06 JAN 94 / US top brass to visit Vietnam


   By REUTER


   WASHINGTON


The head of the US Pacific Command will visit Vietnam this month, the
highest-ranking active-duty US military officer to do so since American
forces withdrew in 1973, Reuter reports from Washington.
Admiral Charles Larson is due to arrive in Hanoi on January 16 for a
three-day visit in which he will discuss prisoner-of-war and
missing-in-action issues, the Pacific Command said yesterday.
The visit coincides with the stepped-up debate in the US on whether Hanoi's
co-operation on the POW/MIA matter warrants further relaxation of the
two-decade US trade embargo against Vietnam.
