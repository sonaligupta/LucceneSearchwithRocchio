FT  15 APR 94 / UK Company News: Recovery continues at Storm


Storm Group, the USM-traded multi-media concern, continued its recovery
during the second half of 1993 and ended the 12 months with pre-tax profits
amounting to Pounds 122,000, compared with losses of Pounds 2.1m restated in
accordance with FRS 3.
The directors said they intended to undertake a capital reorganisation which
would enable the group 'to commence paying dividends as soon as possible'.
Turnover fell from Pounds 6.04m to Pounds 5.23m but there were operating
profits of Pounds 311,000 (Pounds 2.03m losses), after much lower
exceptional debits of Pounds 107,000, against Pounds 2.05m.
The pre-tax figure was after higher interest of Pounds 189,000 (Pounds
52,000).
Earnings per share were 0.2p against losses last time of 2.8p.
Directors stated that during 1993 there was an encouraging increase in sales
of the group's television portfolio and strong interest in a number of its
character properties.
The production facilities studio also contributed to profits, they added,
with two series completed during the year.
