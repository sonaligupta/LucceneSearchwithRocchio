FT  29 OCT 93 / Money Markets: Short sterling recovers


   By PETER JOHN


SHORT sterling recovered yesterday as dealers began to search for a level
they could feel happy with in the run-up to the Budget at the end of
November, writes Peter John.
The futures contract for December expiry opened at 94.54, slightly up from
Wednesday's official close, and traded within a seven basis-point range
before ending at 94.59.
For the last few days of the month traders are squaring their books.
Increasingly over the next few weeks they will be taking positions to
reflect their opinion on interest rates.
Market opinion tends towards a  1/2 percentage point reduction at or shortly
after the Budget, and possibly another half-point cut before Christmas.
However, there is a camp which believes a full one-point cut will be made at
the Budget and some who argue that a case for any rate reduction at all is
disappearing.
Those polarised views are set to pull the December contract in either
direction from a trading range between 94.50 and 94.60 until the expiry of
the contract on December 15.
Meanwhile, a large liquidity shortage was dealt with by the Bank of England
in what one dealer described as 'text book fashion' and caused no serious
problems.
The Bank offered the money market an early round of assistance after
forecasting a shortage of around Pounds 1.95bn, later revised to Pounds
2.05bn.
Among the main factors affecting the position were the take-up of Treasury
Bills and paper maturing in official hands, which drained Pounds 907m from
the system. Bills for repurchase by the market took out Pounds 566m and
Exchequer transactions removed Pounds 370m. Partly offsetting these,
bankers' balances above target injected Pounds 60m.
The Bank provided Pounds 1.503bn of early assistance, buying Pounds 3m of
band one bank bills at the established 5 7/8 per cent rate and Pounds 1.5bn
of bills for resale to the market in equal amounts on November 16 and 17 at
5 29/32 per cent. It added Pounds 359m of assistance in the afternoon,
buying band one bank bills and bringing total help for the day to Pounds
1.862bn.
German call money rates eased following an injection of short-term funds by
the Bundesbank on Wednesday. Dealers were quoting call money at around 6.45
per cent yesterday, down from 6.57 per cent previously after the central
bank injected Section 17 funds late on Tuesday.
