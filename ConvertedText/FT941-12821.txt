FT  28 JAN 94 / Mining pension transfers continue


   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent


The Mineworkers' Pension Scheme said yesterday there had been no let-up in
applications to transfer out of its scheme and into personal pension plans
in spite of recent adverse publicity over such transfers.
Mr Paul Trickett, the scheme's secretary, said about 500 applications to
transfer had been received since December 8 when news broke of a government
investigation into widespread mis-selling by insurance sales agents.
'Nothing has changed,' Mr Trickett said. The average value of sums to be
transferred from the scheme is Pounds 27,000 and the aggregate value of
current applications about Pounds 13.5m. The scheme said more than Pounds
700m had been transferred in the past few years, most of it into personal
schemes which often offer benefits inferior to those offered by British
Coal.
Mr Trickett said all those seeking a transfer had been contacted and urged
to take independent advice, paid for by the scheme. They have also been told
about the government investigation into mis-selling of personal pensions.
