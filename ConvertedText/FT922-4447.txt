FT  05 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continental hangover after
Maastricht vote


   By Our Markets Staff and HILARY BARNES


ONE OR TWO bourses still suffered an emotional hangover from Wednesday's EC
referendum events, writes Our Markets Staff.
According to the investment strategists, they had cause. At Goldman Sachs,
Mr Sushil Wadhwani said that the short term outlook for European equities
had deteriorated considerably since the Danish rejection of Maastricht.
At Morgan Stanley, Mr David Roche concurred, saying that the argument for
European equity assets had weakened; but that France, Germany, the Benelux
countries and the UK remained sound, and were the most defensive.
FRANKFURT reversed Wednesday's trend, shrugging off early weakness to end
with modest gains. After a 6.38 fall to 712.68 in the FAZ index at
midsession, reflecting Wednesday's later weakness on the Danish and French
EC referendum moves, the DAX index recovered to close 3.73 higher at
1,792.31. Volume eased from DM6.9bn to DM6.8bn.
Mr Patrick Bettscheider of Bank Julius Bar in Frankfurt said that this was a
traders' market in the main, nervous about derivatives trading but banking
on Germany as a safe haven amid European disarray; some pension funds came
in on the buying side.
In one case, a little institutional buying went a long way. Porsche rose
another DM51 to DM560, up DM80 since Monday. Tuesday's news of a fall of 32
per cent in the group's US car sales in May, the loss of another 550 jobs
and a drop in parent company operating profits this year drew domestic
newspaper comment and, yesterday, some bottom-fishing by just one investment
buyer.
Meanwhile, the ball bearings group, Kugelfischer, dropped DM8.50 to
DM252.50, taking its loss to DM22.40 since last Friday's 1992 high, and the
shares back to where they were after a deep dividend cut in mid-May. On
Wednesday, Kugelfischer piled on the agony with a forecast of a net loss for
1992.
PARIS recovered its breath and began to take stock of yesterday's dramatic
events. While the CAC-40 managed a positive end to the day, closing 2.26
higher at 1,994.87, it fell as low as 1,972 during the session. With the
dealers keeping their eyes on the bond market the low was reached when trade
in Ecu bond futures was briefly halted during the morning. However, a
successful franc bond auction later lifted sentiment.
BSN also weighed on the market following news that Brussels opposed Nestle's
takeover of Perrier. Under the proposals Nestle would sell the Volvic
division of Perrier to BSN; the latter sank to the day's low of FFr1,076
before recovering to finish down FFr10.00 at FFr1,091.00.
The financial sector recovered from Wednesday's decline with Societe
Generale advancing FFr12.00 to FFr532.00 and Paribas up FFr6.40 at
FFr408.00.
MILAN did not like the European uncertainty, leading blue chips weakened and
the Comit index fell again, by 4.42 to 492.90. Speculation that the Milan
kickback scandal was about to involve senior Italian politicians and make
the formation of a government more difficult also dissuaded buyers.
ZURICH's year-on-year inflation fell to 4.4 per cent in May from 5.1 per
cent in April, raising hopes that today's nationwide inflation figure will
also be lower. The SMI index edged up 1.7 to 1,916.9.
AMSTERDAM firmed as the market generally ignored the Masstricht upset which,
it was felt, has few short term implications for the Netherlands. The CBS
Tendency Index closed up 0.4 at 130.6 in light turnover of Fl 546.3m.
KLM was the main interest as the airline group said that it would resume
dividend payments. It closed 80 cents higher at Fl 40.30.
MADRID weakened, the general index losing 2.36 to 258.06 in turnover of some
Pta12.6bn. Fecsa lost Pta11 to Pta741 on rumours, later denied, that the
company would not be paying a dividend. Tubacex fell Pta32 to Pta242 after
saying that it had entered temporary receivership. Some analysts said that
trading in the steel tube company may be suspended today.
BRUSSELS eased on the first day of the new forward account. Dividend
payments by Solvay and Delhaize had some effect on the Bel-20 index which
lost 7.13 to 1,224.10 in turnover of BFr967m.
STOCKHOLM worried that the refusal of Danish voters to ratify the Maastricht
Treaty would lead to the collapse of the EMS and delay Swedish EC
membership. The Affarsvarlden General index slipped 4.2 to 979.7.
COPENHAGEN slipped again in the wake of Denmark's Maastricht referendum
result, writes Hilary Barnes. The all-share index was down 3.66 at 331.47.
Turnover was moderate, falling to DKr147m.
VIENNA fell but still maintained its position above the 1,000 level. The ATX
index closed 3.67 weaker at 1,003.26.
