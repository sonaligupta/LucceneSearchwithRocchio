FT  09 JUN 92 / Council anger at pay opt-out advice


GOVERNMENT advice to local councils to opt out of national pay bargaining
has evoked a strong response from the Association of Metropolitan
Authorities.
The Environment Department, in guidance to the Local Government Commission,
which is advising on the future of the authorities, says the government
supports moves to 'greater realism, flexibility and performance-related pay
within the national pay negotiating framework'.
It adds that it is also encouraging authorities to opt out of that
framework.
In a letter to Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, the association
says that of the 25 authorities that have already opted out, most arrived
last year at settlements that were higher than the national deal.
It adds: 'It seems perverse for the government, who are keen for all
employers to avoid inflationary wage settlements, to encourage authorities
to opt out of national bargaining which can only have the effect of
leapfrogging.'
