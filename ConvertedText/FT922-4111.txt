FT  06 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: TI/Dowty


TI's bid for Dowty looks a closer call than at first appeared. When it was
launched, no one expected Dowty to be declaring profits of Pounds 33m for
1991-92. But if the bid, worth 193p at last night's close, looks less
generous than before, that does not change the fundamentals.
Dowty has reaped an early harvest from its restructuring, but there must be
doubts about the continuing pace of improvement, especially in electronics.
The company has given no details of its order book and was forced yesterday
by the Takeover Panel to dissociate itself from market estimates of sharply
higher profits this year. Even at Pounds 45m pre-tax, Dowty would be trading
on an expensive forward multiple of 16. Investors who side with TI may
sacrifice some running yield, but their chances of capital appreciation
would increase. TI brings scope for higher margins and a better chance of
selling the loss-making Cognito venture.
