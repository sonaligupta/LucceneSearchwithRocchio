FT  20 APR 91 / Money Markets: Bank lends at 12%


INTEREST RATES had a slightly softer tone in London yesterday, after news of
much lower than expected M4 lending by UK banks and building societies in
March.
Lending rose by only Pounds 700m, compared with a rise of Pounds 5.9bn in
February, but any thoughts that this might encourage an early cut in bank
base rates were countered by the Bank of England when it lent funds to the
money market at 12 per cent, to underline the present rate structure.
Three-month sterling interbank eased to 11 25/32 -11 21/32 from 11 13/16 -11
per cent and 12-month money fell to 11 3/8 -11 1/4 from 11 7/16 -11 5/16 per
cent.
The M4 lending figures led to a firming of short sterling futures on Liffe.
June delivery opened slightly lower at 88.67 but touched a peak of 88.76,
before closing at 88.71 compared with 88.68 previously.
On the London cash market the Bank of England initially forecast a
day-to-day credit shortage of Pounds 600m, but revised this to Pounds 650m
in the afternoon. Total help of Pounds 582m was provided.
Before lunch the authorities bought Pounds 2m bank bills outright in band 2
at 11 13/16 per cent. In the afternoon the central bank did not buy any more
bills, but invited the discount houses to use their borrowing facilities. A
total of Pounds 580m was lent to the houses for seven days at 12 per cent.
Bills maturing in official hands, repayment of late assistance and a take-up
of Treasury bills drained Pounds 917m, with a rise in the note circulation
absorbing Pounds 490m and bank balances below target Pounds 15m. These
outweighed exchequer transactions adding Pounds 820m to liquidity.
At the weekly Treasury bill tender the average rate of discount on 91-day
bills fell to 11.1806 from 11.2351 per cent and the average on 182-day bills
declined to 10.7229 from 10.7254 per cent.
The Pounds 500m 91-day bills on offer attracted bids of Pounds 2.593bn and
the Pounds 200m of 182-day bills received bids of Pounds 942m.
The highest accepted rate on 91-day bills was 11.1907 per cent, equal to a
price of Pounds 97.210 and bids at that level were allotted around 61 per
cent of the amount applied for.
The top accepted price on 182-day bills was 10.7494 per cent, equal to a
price of Pounds 94.640. Bids at that level received about 3 per cent of the
amount applied for.
