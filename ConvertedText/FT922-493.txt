FT  27 JUN 92 / Money Markets: Rates edge higher


The Bank of England failed to take out its forecast liquidity shortage
yesterday in an otherwise dull day on the UK money markets.
Although the Bank was not offered sufficient bills to meet the shortage,
money rates did not move significantly, edging only a little higher on
Thursday's close. The overnight rate touched 12 per cent but hovered for
most of the day at around 10 per cent.
UK interbank rates remain vulnerable to signs that German inflation is still
climbing. Higher than expected growth in German M3 reported earlier this
week means a cut in German base rates is still a long way off. But traders
said they expected money rates to ease a little next week as half year
pressures lifted.
'You always get pressures from certain quarters when people need to square
their positions at the half and quarter year. Rates usually ease a little
afterwards,' said one.
The Bank's initial forecast liquidity shortage was Pounds 950m, but this was
revised twice. In morning operations the Bank purchased bills totalling
Pounds 24m. This included Pounds 15m of band-3 bills at 9 21/32 per cent and
Pounds 9m of band-4 bills at 9 19/32 per cent.
After revising the shortage to Pounds 1bn the Bank bought a further Pounds
164m of bills. This was made up of Pounds 29m of band-1 bills at 9 7/8 per
cent, Pounds 36m of band-3 Treasury bills at 9 21/32 per cent and Pounds 99m
of band-3 bills at the same interest rate as before.
The Bank intervened again in the afternoon buying Pounds 412m of band-1
bills, Pounds 151m of band-2, Pounds 1m of band-3 Treasury bills and Pounds
11m band-3 bills all at the same rates as above. Late assistance of Pounds
30m brought total help for the day to Pounds 793m. This compared with the
final forecast of a Pounds 1.1bn liquidity shortage.
The key three-month interbank rate rose  1/16 of a point to close at around
10 1/8 per cent. Six month money closed at 10 1/16 per cent compared with
Thursday's close of around 10 per cent.
There was very little activity on the sterling futures market. The September
future moved only two ticks on the day in thin trading.
German call money approached the 9.75 per cent Lombard rate yesterday, but
dealers were confident the Bundesbank would step in with extra liquidity if
necessary to prevent any further market tightening.
