FT  05 AUG 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report


   By REUTER


The GOLD price scrambled back above Dollars 400 a troy ounce yesterday
afternoon as renewed speculative buying in the US partially countered heavy
sales in the morning, attributed to producers, professionals and the Chinese
central bank. At the London close the price, which had dipped to Dollars
399, was quoted at Dollars 401.50 a troy ounce. The PLATINUM market remained
firm throughout the day, supported by news that wage talks at South Africa's
Impala mine were going to mediation. At London's afternoon fix the price
reached a 31-month high of Dollars 419 an ounce, up Dollars 1.60. London
Metal Exchange base metal prices were led higher by copper, aluminium alone
defying the trend. COPPER absorbed early liquidation and moved ahead after
August option declarations passed without any surprises and Chinese buying
emerged. At the close the three months quotation was Dollars 1,949.25 a
tonne, up Dollars 3. Three months ALUMINIUM'S Dollars 4.75 fall to Dollars
1,236.50 a tonne, was blamed on disappointment at the failure to materialise
of an expected US production cut announcement. An early rise in LEAD
triggered stop-loss buying and the price closed Dollars 7 up at Dollars
411.75.
