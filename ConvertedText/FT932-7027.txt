FT  26 MAY 93 / ITC to examine Tyne Tees again


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


THE Independent Television Commission is to review Yorkshire-Tyne Tees
Television's performance at the end of this year to make sure that the
merged ITV company is carrying out its licence obligations.
The decision follows an investigation launched amid fears that the merger
was undermining the the company's ability to act as a separate broadcaster
in north-east England.
In a letter to Sir Derek Palmar, the Yorkshire-Tyne Tees chairman, published
yesterday, Sir George Russell, ITC chairman, makes clear that the commission
has insisted on a restructuring of the company to emphasise the separate
identity of each region.
Under the new structure there will be no group director of programmes.
Instead Mr Clive Leach, group chief executive, will work with Mr John
Fairley, managing director of Yorkshire, and Mr John Calvert, managing
director of Tyne Tees.
The commission has accepted the arrangements put in place because they
provided 'a clear and unambiguous chain of programme commissioning and
production, together with editorial and scheduling responsibility within
Tyne Tees'.
Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant stake in
Yorkshire-Tyne Tees.
