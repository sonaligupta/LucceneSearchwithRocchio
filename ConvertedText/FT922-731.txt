FT  26 JUN 92 / Consortium in bid to keep RiverBus going


   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent


A CONSORTIUM of public and private interests is on the brink of launching a
bid to rescue RiverBus, London's heavily loss-making Thames passenger
service, from closure.
The RiverBus is due to close on Tuesday after the recent financial collapse
of Olympia & York's Canary Wharf property development, which had subsidised
it.
The administrators of Canary Wharf have refused to underwrite RiverBus's
losses beyond the end of this month. That means the company is due to become
insolvent and close at midnight on Tuesday.
Now, a consortium of interests in London's Docklands is close to agreeing on
proposals to inject Pounds 300,000 into the company to keep it going for
three months while attempts are made to save it.
The consortium is led by the London Docklands Development Corporation, the
state-owned body charged with the regeneration of Docklands. Members include
the Canary Wharf administrators, P&O, several large Docklands businesses,
and local authorities in the Docklands area.
The consortium wants the RiverBus to survive because it is an important
transport link between central London and Docklands. A scheduled service
runs every 20 minutes between Chelsea Harbour in the west and Greenwich in
the east, stopping at six points in central London and at Canary Wharf.
P&O's interest in the rescue stems from its position as a shareholder in
RiverBus. The company also has a large property development at Chelsea
Harbour and is the biggest single construction contractor at Canary Wharf.
RiverBus has consistently lost money since it was founded because passenger
numbers have failed to rise to the point where it has been able to cover its
costs. Losses are currently estimated at Pounds 2m a year. Passenger numbers
are rising, though, and the company believes it has a profitable future if
it can make better use of its assets by joining with a suitable partner.
The consortium believes a three-month breathing space will give RiverBus at
least two possible options for survival. One is that Canary Wharf will find
a purchaser ready to restore the service's subsidy; the other that a
purchaser for RiverBus will be found.
RiverBus is believed to be in talks with four interested parties, but none
is at a sufficiently advanced stage of negotiations that it is ready or
willing to make an offer.
