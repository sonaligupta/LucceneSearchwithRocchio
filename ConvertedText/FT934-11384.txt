FT  01 NOV 93 / Observer: Boo to EU?


For all you folk soundly asleep at midnight last night, unmoved by the
passing of a momentous historic occasion, welcome to European Union.
'Nothing could better illustrate this stillborn treaty than its coming into
effect on the eve of the day of the dead'. One of many to remark on the
ennui with which the treaty's coming is greeted, French far-right
nationalist Jean-Marie Le Pen may have a point.
By contrast with the short history of the European endeavour, All Souls' Day
was first celebrated 995 years ago at the behest of Odilo, abbot of Cluny.
He had been struck by the tale of a pilgrim returning from Palestine who had
been wrecked on a rocky isle, home to a hermit. The pilgrim had promptly
been led to a fiery crevice, from which issued the groans of tormented
souls. The good abbot duly ordered that a day be set aside to commemorate
all those in purgatory.
How long, then, should Europe's politicians suffer before they are forgiven
for signing Maastricht?
