FT  20 APR 94 / Business Air Travel (22): Airports of the world - Chancing
the fog at Linate / Milan


   By JOHN SIMKINS


Early morning passengers bound for Milan often betray an almost British
preoccupation with the weather. Is it foggy at Linate Airport? Will there be
a delay or even a re-routing?
The tendency for mist at Linate is aggravated by the nearby presence of an
artificial lake. Unfortunately, until mid-1995 the airport is without an
instrumental landing system, which is being improved to allow aircraft to
land in visibility of less than 75 metres.
On a clear day, the traveller can look forward to Linate, which is well
equipped and convenient for meetings in Milan. It is only 10km from the city
centre and a taxi ride costs L25,000 (about Pounds 10.50).
An airport bus, at 20 minutes frequency, connects with the main railway
station where there is also access to two of the city's three Metropolitana
(underground) lines. Tickets cost L4,000. Alternatively, there is the No 73
bus which has its other terminal at Santa Babila in the heart of the city.
In common with all buses, the L1,200 tickets have to be bought at newspaper
stalls.
There are three car parks, including a multi-storey for 1,300 cars, pleasant
bars and duty free and a business centre. The friendly woman at the
information desk, who offers a passenger one of her own L200 coins for a
telephone call, is typical of the local attitude.
Recent improvements at the airport have provided passengers with
rolling-bridge access to 75 per cent of national flights and also a new
national departure lounge connecting with international flight departures.
The baggage area for international arrivals has been extended.
But Linate, about the seventh biggest European airport with 9.5m passengers,
can grow no more and this is of great concern to Alitalia, which claims that
L3bn a day is lost in air fares sold by rival airports. Work on upgrading
Milan's other airport, Malpensa, with 3.6m passengers, got held up by
inquiries into Italy's Tangentopoli bribes scandal and, for now, the link
with the city is a 60-minute bus ride costing L12,000 for the 45km journey,
or a L120,000 taxi ride. Travellers usually prefer to chance the fog at
Linate.
