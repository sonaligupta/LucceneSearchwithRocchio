FT  21 DEC 92 / Observer: Slowing down


John Ashcroft, former Guardian young businessman of the year and ex-boss of
the over-acquisitive Coloroll which collapsed in 1990, is again trying to
grow a business at breakneck speed.
Rapid growth imposes its own strains: some suppliers to the new venture, an
outdoor clothing company, appropriately called Survival Aids, have been
grumbling about being kept waiting for their money. Ashcroft bought the
company in early 1991, installed himself as managing director, and planned
to double or treble the company's annual turnover - then Pounds 4.5m -
within five years.
It sounds like Survival Aids' expansion has been going according to plan.
Since Ashcroft arrived its retail branch network - it also has a sizeable
mail order trade - has grown from three shops, plus a kiosk at Aldershot, to
14 stores spread from Glasgow to Bristol. It has opened three new shops this
autumn alone.
Ebullient as ever, Ashcroft says that his business is 'going pretty well
really'. He declines to talk publicly about the mutterings of discontent
from some suppliers. But he indicated that Survival Aids is now entering a
period of consolidation. 'We'll catch up with ourselves now, in the next 12
months', he promises.
