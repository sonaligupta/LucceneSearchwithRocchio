FT  26 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Kalamazoo held back to Pounds 0.6m for
eight months


   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent


DISPOSAL of loss-making subsidiaries and over-capacity in the printing
sector held back the profits of Kalamazoo, the computer services and printed
systems group.
Pre-tax surplus for the eight months ended March were Pounds 611,000 against
Pounds 3.66m in its last full financial year, to July 1991, or Pounds 2.3m
for the eight months to March 1991.
Kalamazoo is changing its financial year end to March. It last reported in
March on the six months to last January and the updating of the accounts by
two months reflects little difference in its trading position.
The computer services business, which accounts for 66 per cent of group
business, continued to grow with a seven per cent increase in revenue from
one 8-month period to the next.
But the printed systems business saw most of its profits wiped out by the
recession, manifest in the over-capacity of the printing industry and a
decline in repeat orders.
The sale of US and New Zealand subsidiaries took Pounds 1.2m out of
operating profits.
'The group has negligible gearing and although there will be restructuring
costs as we reposition our printed systems business, we are confident of
profit growth in the coming year,' said Mr Peter Harrop, the chairman.
Earnings per share for the eight months to last March were nil.
The final dividend is 0.875p a share, making a total for the eight months of
1.4p. Payments for 1990/1991 were 2p.
