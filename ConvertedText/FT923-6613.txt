THE OUTNATION: A SEARCH FOR THE SOUL OF JAPAN by Jonathan Rauch Harvard
Business School Press Dollars 18.95, 200 pages
JAPANESE goods have conquered the world. Japanese companies have bought
parts of the Great American Dream. Japan's leaders take their places at the
top table at international gatherings. Its citizens have become familiar
figures in the most fashionable locations in the most cosmopolitan cities of
the world.
Japan nevertheless conjures up conflicting images, because of its mix of
modern occidental practices with the mysticism of the orient. Sometimes it
is presented as an alien country whose inhabitants might have come from
outer space. Such a view is fostered by Yamato nationalists who claim that
Japan is unique, certainly like nowhere else on earth. Eminent Japanese have
written articles claiming that Japanese brains, Japanese intestines and even
Japanese snow are different from any other brains, intestines or snow.
These two authors went to Japan to explore its mysteries. Peregrine Hodson
is British, a barrister, had lived in Japan before, speaks Japanese and
wrote his account after spending three years in Tokyo working for a foreign
bank. Jonathan Rauch is an American on his first visit, who does not speak
Japanese and who spent six months in the country. Both books are highly
personalised and episodic.
Hodson's most frequently used word is 'I'. Possibly Hodson's object is to
get into the Guinness Book of Records for the number of uses of the personal
pronoun. It is slightly more interesting counting the 'I's than reading what
goes in between. There is some interesting material and he has a few vivid
descriptions, but if he spent as much time as he admits breathing into his
tape recorder during office hours it is a surprise that he survived so long.
In contrast, Rauch's observations raise very pertinent issues without an
intrusive 'I'. The book is riveting. Precisely because he does not set
himself up as an expert, but goes to see and learn before drawing his
conclusions, Rauch has written an enjoyable, profound book, perhaps a minor
classic.
He finds a Japan that reminds him of Plato's utopia based on Sparta. He
finds much that reminds him of the US years ago. He demolishes the claim
that the Japanese alone have a distinction between 'tatemae', the feelings
they show to the world, and 'honne', what they really feel. Similar
distinctions, he correctly observes, can be found in most cultures. He
dismisses the myth of Japanese uniqueness: 'The Japanese are precisely as
mysterious and unique as my aunt in Hackensack,' he concludes.
