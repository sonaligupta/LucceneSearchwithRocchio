FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Feedback in red


Reduced turnover and the cost of a number of 'policy initiatives' resulted
in a sharp lapse into the red at Feedback, the USM-traded electronic and
electrical equipment group.
Turnover for the six months to September 30 amounted to Pounds 4.18m, down
from Pounds 4.47m; losses totalled Pounds 374,400 against pre-tax profits
last time of Pounds 267,900.
Losses per share were 3.87p (earnings of 2.13p) but the interim dividend is
maintained at 0.5p.
