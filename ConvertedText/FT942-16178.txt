FT  12 APR 94 / More NHS trusts 'fail to meet cash targets'


Many hospital and community trusts are failing to meet government financial
targets, and 'significantly more' failed in 1992-93 than in the previous
year, a report said yesterday.
Analysis of the early years of National Health Service trust development
found that 47 per cent of first-wave trusts failed to meet the government's
target of earning a real return on capital of at least 6 per cent. This
compared with 17 per cent failing to meet the target the previous year.
The number of trusts that failed to break even or operate within borrowing
limits had also increased, The Fourth Newchurch Guide to NHS Trusts said. It
also found that systems for monitoring and measuring performance of trusts
had failed to keep pace with their rapid growth.
There are about 400 trusts with incomes ranging from Pounds 15m to Pounds
230m. From this month NHS trusts are responsible for delivering Pounds 17bn
of healthcare - equivalent to 7 per cent of total government spending.
However, the report noted that the direction and pace of change of the NHS
reforms had taken both policy makers and managers by surprise. It said
fundamental changes would not go smoothly unless they were made to work for
the benefit of patients.
For trusts to succeed, managers would have to:
Make information about their activities more available. Have guidelines on
mergers of trusts which set out the benefits to patients.
Have a tighter financial-reporting regime.
Have clear ideas on how to merge different kinds of trusts.
