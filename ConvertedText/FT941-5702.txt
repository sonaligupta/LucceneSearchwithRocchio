FT  04 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei 225 average eases
further amid low activity

Uncertainty over the course of the bond and foreign exchange markets
undermined investor confidence and equity prices lost ground on small-lot
arbitrage selling amid low activity, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average ended 138.91 off at 19,605.86 after a day's high of
19,771.68 and low of 19,531.65. After rising in early trading, the index met
arbitrage linked selling and later fluctuated within a narrow range for the
rest of the day.
Continued tension in the US-Japan trade arena also discouraged investors:
the US has threatened to revive the Super 301 trade act of 1988 against
Japan due to its alleged closed cellular telephone market.
The absence of dealers and foreign investors - the main driving force behind
the recent rise in share prices - depressed volume, and some 280m shares
changed hands against Wednesday's 401m.
The Topix index of all first section stocks slipped 13.61 to 1,602.33, while
the Nikkei 300 average declined 2.75 to 295.32. Losers outnumbered gainers
by 783 to 248, with 151 issues unchanged. But in London the ISE/Nikkei 50
index firmed 3.47 to 1,324.68.
Steel shares were weaker on reports that NKK would forgo dividend payments
for the current year to March and the next business year. NKK dipped Y9 to
Y250, Kawasaki Steel Y7 to Y353 and Nippon Steel Y8 to Y338.
Investors shunned broker issues due to the recent plunge on the domestic
bond market. Nomura Securities fell Y60 to Y2,270 and Daiwa Securities Y40
to Y1,680.
Shares of bakers and flour millers rose on hopes that consumers would turn
to bread because of the decline in domestic rice supplies and the increase
in imported rice. Yamazaki Baking gained Y10 at Y2,070 and Nisshin Flour
Milling Y20 at Y1,200.
Hisamitsu Pharmaceutical jumped Y63 to Y979 on reports of a new medicine
based on biotechnology. Hopes of increased business in the US cable
television market lifted Tomen, the trading house which has links to Nynex
Corp, of the US, Y11 to Y416.
In Osaka, the OSE average declined 235.96 to 21,808.53 in volume of 120.7m
shares.
