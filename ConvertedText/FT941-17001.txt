FT  06 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading


   By TERRY BYLAND


Stock index futures yesterday had rather less influence over underlying
share prices than on the previous session, but suffered a further bout of
selling pressure, writes Terry Byland.
As in previous sessions, the trend was somewhat erratic, but the March
contract on the FT-SE 100 Index was finally dominated by a single determined
seller.
The first few hours of trading went well, with the March contract at a
premium of around 20 points to cash, against a fair value premium estimated
at around 13 points. This provided opportunities for arbitraging, when the
futures can be bought and the underlying shares sold.
But such operations were soon driven out of court when the seller of the
contract emerged in the mid-morning. The contract fell off and was briefly
at a discount to the cash market.
In spite of attempted rallies, March closed at the low of the day to show a
premium of only 9 points to the Footsie index itself, and therefore a
discount of around four points to fair value. Volume was fairly high at
15,761 lots, and the contract continued to ease in later trading.
Traded options had a busy session, recording 63,977 contracts traded,
against 40,740 previously. Mirroring the stock market, the FT-SE contract
saw turnover dip to 14,165 from Tuesday's 18,658. The Euro FT-SE contract
reported 10,948 deals.
Among individual stock options, brokerage recommendations continued to
provide the driving force. Both Fisons (1,760 lots) and Ladbroke (1,565)
benefited under this score. Land Securities (6,183) headed the list.
