FT  05 JUN 92 / Change in US forests may curb logging


   By GEORGE GRAHAM


   WASHINGTON


THE US Forest Service is to change its forest management philosophy in a
move that could sharply alter logging practices and help to revive
indigenous tree species almost wiped out by rapidly-growing softwoods.
Mr Dale Robertson, service chief, has instructed regional foresters to start
to manage the 191m acres of national forest under their authority as
'dynamic and complex eco-systems,' instead of concentrating on maximising
timber production.
The new policy is to lead to a 70 per cent reduction in clear-cutting, where
loggers clear an entire area of trees and brush, and to a greater use of
less intensive logging techniques that leave some trees standing.
At the moment, clear-cutting is used on about a third of the 800,000 to
900,000 acres harvested each year in national forests, and accounts for a
much higher proportion of timber volume.
The Forestry Service also aims to restore traditional North American tree
species, including east coast hardwoods and the western ponderosa pine,
which has been largely superseded by faster-growing species such as Douglas
fir and lodgepole pine.
Forestry officials said reduction of clear-cutting would lead to a
short-term drop of about 10 per cent in timber volume harvested, but added
that volumes would return to their previous levels over time, through
development that pays attention to variations in tree maturities.
Stable volumes would imply logging on larger acreages. This might be
difficult because of environmental challenges to logging of any kind on vast
areas of national forest land that shelter endangered species of wildlife.
Even so, some foresters argue there is ample scope for sustaining volumes by
thinning existing forests.
The exact consequences of the new eco-system in forest management policy are
difficult to predict, especially as it is by no means clear that Mr
Robertson will be allowed to proceed with his policy change by President
George Bush.
He likes to call himself the 'environmental president' but his
administration has usually considered timber industry jobs more important
than ecological concerns.
Industry officials argue that clear-cutting is not just the cheapest way to
harvest trees, but also the best way to ensure replanting.
'It's cheaper, but it is also often the best way to get regeneration,' said
Ms Anne Heissenbuttel, director of forest planning and policy at the
National Forest Products Association.
However, Mr Neil Sampson, executive vice-president of American Forests, a
conservation organisation, says that the Robertson memorandum would
represent a dramatic shift from the European philosophy of treating forests
as agricultural factories by planting acres of single softwood species.
'It's not a non-economic view of forest management - it's a view which says
people may not be powerful enough or smart enough to replace a natural
forest with an artificial forest,' he said.
