FT  13 NOV 92 / Dairy Crest to shed 390 jobs


   By DAVID BLACKWELL


DAIRY CREST, the Milk Marketing Board's manufacturing subsidiary which has
25 per cent of the UK market for dairy products, is to shed 390 jobs, David
Blackwell writes.
Dairy Crest said the move was part of a rationalisation programme. It
includes the closure of the cheese factory at Four Crosses in Powys and the
butter and milk powder factory at Torrington in Devon. Milk powder and
cheese manufacture at Maelor in Clwyd will be closed by the end of June next
year.
