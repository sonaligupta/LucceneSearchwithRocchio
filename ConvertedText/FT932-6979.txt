FT  26 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Speyhawk


The appointment of receivers at Speyhawk will send shivers down the spines
of struggling property developers but is unlikely to scare them rigid. The
decision seems to owe more to the particularities of Speyhawk than a sea
change in policy by the banks. In truth, it may reflect little more than a
loss of patience with a company which has long been technically insolvent
and recently revealed a further downward lurch in asset values.
Nevertheless, the timing still looks odd in light of the hazy upturn in the
property market. Speyhawk's property portfolio may be among the last to
benefit, given the company's habit of building speculative developments in
south east England. It seems improbable, though, that even bankers would be
so rash as to kill any recovery stone dead by prematurely dumping properties
on the market.
