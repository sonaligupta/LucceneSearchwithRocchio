FT  05 AUG 93 / People: Rawel quits Eurocamp


Julian Rawel, sales and marketing director of EUROCAMP, the camping holiday
group, is leaving after 16 years. He will not be replaced, as most of his
responsibilities have been taken over by the directors of the group's
subsidiary companies. Eurocamp says Rawel's departure is amicable; he
intends to pursue other interests.
