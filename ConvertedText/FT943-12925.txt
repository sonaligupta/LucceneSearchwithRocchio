FT  22 JUL 94 / Rifkind defends forces budget cuts


   By BERNARD GRAY


Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, insisted yesterday that cuts he
announced last week would not affect the fighting strength of UK forces,
which would still be capable of mounting a campaign similar to that in the
Falklands war.
Appearing before the Commons defence committee, Mr Rifkind denied that the
cuts put the Treasury first. He said that in addition to the Pounds 750m a
year of cuts which would go to the Treasury in 1997, about Pounds 100m of
extra savings had been identified which would go to the forces. About Pounds
60m is to be spent on a joint-service rapid reaction command centre to
co-ordinate activity between groups such as the para-chute brigade and the
Royal Marines.
Mr Nicholas Bonsor, chairman of the committee, said that little of the
Pounds 3bn of equipment ordered last week came as a result of savings. Mr
Rifkind replied that had the savings not been made, some of the programmes
would have been in jeopardy.
Sir Nicholas Fairbairn asked whether the cuts in support meant that the
forces had been inefficient before or were being cut back now. Mr Rifkind
said the time taken to conduct the study meant new and more efficient ways
had been found to manage tasks.
He said that it cost up to Pounds 15,000 to enlist each serviceman, but
using Jobcentres instead of recruiting offices meant the same job could be
done at much lower cost.
