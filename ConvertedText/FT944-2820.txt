FT  15 DEC 94 / International Company News: JP Morgan issues profits warning


   By RICHARD WATERS


   NEW YORK


J. P. Morgan, the US bank, warned that its profits for the last quarter of
the year would not match those of the previous three months, due to weaker
trading revenues, writes Richard Waters in New York.
The news, which reversed a strong rise in the bank's shares earlier in the
day, signalled a weak end to the year generally for banks which are active
in the financial markets.
The consensus among analysts had been for earnings of Dollars 1.69 a share
in the latest period at Morgan, compared with Dollars 1.63 in the previous
quarter. In the final three months of 1993, a period when bond markets
around the world remained strong, the US bank earned Dollars 1.92 a share.
In spite of the warning, the bank lifted its quarterly dividend by 7 cents a
share, to 75 cents.
