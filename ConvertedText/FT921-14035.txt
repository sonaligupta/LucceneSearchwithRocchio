FT  17 JAN 92 / Observer: The City expects


While we're talking about codes, isn't it time Trafalgar House replaced the
three flags in its logo with a more appropriate message?
The three pennants spell out the number 253, which the company insists was
the code Nelson used for 'England' in his signal about expecting every man
to do his duty at the battle of Trafalgar. But to judge by yesterday's
rather stormy annual general meeting, the company of Trafalgar isn't living
up to City expectations at least.
A more apt logo might be letter-flags SFV, signifying 'my engines are going
full speed astern, I am disabled - communicate with me, and I require
assistance'.
