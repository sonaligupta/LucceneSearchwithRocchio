FT  16 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: LME copper market touches 5 1/4
 year high


   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent


Copper prices on the London Metal Exchange yesterday surged to their highest
levels for five and a quarter years. Aggressive buying by traders, producers
and consumers helped the market move upwards, analysts said. That attracted
new money from investment funds, which swamped some profit-taking by other
funds.
Prices suggested that supplies of copper for immediate delivery were tight.
At the close last night the backwardation, or premium for immediate delivery
compared with delivery in three months, widened from Dollars 52.50 a tonne
on Wednesday to Dollars 59.50.
Traders reported there was nervousness in the market about the approaching
'third Wednesday' options activity next week which also focused attention on
copper's supply tightness.
'Copper will remain tight until significant new supply hits the market - and
that's six months away,' said Mr Wiktor Bielski, analyst at Bain & Co, a
Deutsche Bank subsidiary. He suggested the three-month copper price, which
closed last night at Dollars 2,979.50 a tonne after reaching Dollars 2,990
at one point, was on target for Dollars 1.40 a pound (Dollars 3,085.60 a
tonne). 'I would not be surprised to see copper at Dollars 1.50 to Dollars
1.60 a pound in the first quarter (of 1995),' Mr Bielski added.
Mr Ted Arnold, analyst at the Merrill Lynch financial services group, said
copper had 'the best fundamentals' of any of the LME-traded metals. In his
monthly metals report he suggested copper could reach Dollars 1.40 to
Dollars 1.50 a pound and that 'the high will probably come during the second
quarter, which traditionally is the strongest quarter for (metals)
consumption'.
He recalled that the highest price paid for LME copper was Dollars 3,707 a
tonne or Dollars 1.68 a pound on December 8, 1988, at which time the
cash-to-three month premium was Dollars 546 a tonne.
