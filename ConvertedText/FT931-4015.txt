   By LOUISE KEHOE


NATIONAL Semiconductor's share price rose strongly yesterday when the US
chip manufacturer reported improved third quarter earnings.
Net income for the quarter was Dollars 26.9m, or 19 cents a share, compared
with Dollars 14.5m, or 11 cents, in the corresponding period last year. Net
sales rose 22 per cent to Dollars 491.5m from Dollars 401.8m.
The third-quarter results included a net contribution to income of Dollars
400,000 from exceptional items. These items included a Dollars 8.3m gain
from patent licence fees, partially offset by Dollars 3.2m in legal expenses
for a tax case and a Dollars 4.7m write-down of a minority investment.
Mr Gilbert Amelio, president and chief executive, said: 'I am pleased with
our third-quarter results, which demonstrate that we are continuing our
profitability for the sixth consecutive quarter, with substantial
improvement in income from operations.'
He added: 'Semiconductor industry business conditions continued to improve
in the third quarter.' Gross margins improved as a result of restructuring
of manufacturing operations, he said.
For the nine-month period, National Semiconductor reported net income of
Dollars 84.1m, or 63 cents per share, on sales of Dollars 1.4bn.
This compared with a net loss of Dollars 147.6m, or Dollars 1.49 per share,
on sales of Dollars 1.2bn last time.
The 1992 results included a restructuring charge of Dollars 149.3m in the
first quarter. National Semiconductor's share price closed up Dollars 1 3/8
at Dollars 12 7/8 .
