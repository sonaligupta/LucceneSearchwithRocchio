FT  12 NOV 92 / Sharp rise in negative equity in homes


   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU


ONE IN FIVE homes bought in the past five years is now worth less than the
mortgage on it, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the social research body,
says in a survey today.
The survey, based on a sample of 1m homeowners, estimates that the total
value of negative equity in Britain is Pounds 2.68bn, compared with Pounds
1.2bn in October last year. Of this total negative equity 99 per cent is
held by people who have bought homes since 1987.
The south-east has the highest proportion of negative equity, with greater
London the worst affected. Forty-one per cent of people who bought in the
London area between 1988 and 1991 had negative equity last month, according
to the report, with an average deficit of Pounds 5,500 per household.
Only 1 per cent of buyers in Scotland are affected. The rises for the north
and north-west are comparatively low, while the rest of the south-east and
the east Midlands have the highest negative equity rates outside London.
More than half of homeowners who bought their property since 1987 with 95
per cent mortgages have negative equity, compared with less than 1 per cent
of those with mortgages of 80 per cent.
The position is different for homeowners who bought before the steep
increases in prices. Mr Daniel Dorling, one of the report's authors, said:
'Almost no one who bought before 1987 has negative equity.'
He added: 'Our research shows clearly that those who have been worst
affected are people with high percentage mortgages in the south-east who
have struggled to enter the property market at the bottom end. They are
likely to be the least well-placed to escape from the negative equity trap.'
