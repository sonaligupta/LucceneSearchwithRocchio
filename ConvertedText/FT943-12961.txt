FT  22 JUL 94 / Household spending may rise


   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

Japanese households spent less in May for the fourth consecutive month, but
a surge in sales of beer and air conditioners due to an unusually hot summer
may revive consumption.
The latest household survey by the government's management and co-ordination
agency shows a 1.7 per cent drop in consumer spending in the year to May, to
an average of Y316,080 (Pounds 2,060) per house-hold.
Household spending rose for four months until February, but then moved into
reverse in line with increased weakening in the labour market. An agency
official said May's decline was mainly due to less spending on rice, a
reaction to widespread stockpiling because of rice shortages at the start of
the year.
However, an income tax rebate paid in June - worth Y40,000 to an average
wage earner on Y4.7m a year - and the onset of sweltering heat in July could
lift household spending again, the official added.
