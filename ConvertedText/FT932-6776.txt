FT  27 MAY 93 / Gas field contract announced


   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY


THE FIRST land-based contract for the Pounds 1.2bn development of Liverpool
Bay's gas field was announced yesterday, Ian Hamilton Fazey writes.
The project will deliver offshore gas through a terminal at Point of Ayr at
the mouth of the River Dee by underground pipeline to a new power station at
Connah's Quay, Clwyd, north Wales.
The Pounds 60m contract to build the terminal has gone to AOC International.
David McLean Contractors, which is based in nearby Flint, north Wales, will
carry out associated civil works. Up to 700 local jobs will be created.
Offshore contracts have still to be awarded by Hamilton Oil, which is
developing the field with Lasmo and Monument. Hamilton said yesterday
offshore specifications have not been finalised.
GEC Alsthom is to build the 1,350 MW station for PowerGen.
The contract for the terminal assumes the first gas will be pumped into
Wales in 1996.
