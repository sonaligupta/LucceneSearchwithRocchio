FT  04 SEP 93 / Curbs on invalidity benefit closer


   By DAVID OWEN


THE GOVERNMENT yesterday appeared closer to a decision to tighten doctors'
guidelines on whether patients should receive invalidity benefit.
Mr Alistair Burt, social security minister, said the first of a series of
government-commissioned surveys on the subject confirmed anecdotal evidence
that doctors were 'finding it difficult to adhere to the criteria'. The
survey said doctors were including some people that they should not, he
added.
Invalidity benefit is one of the areas earmarked for possible savings in the
government's long-term review of social security spending.
Ministers have argued for scrutiny of the area partly because invalidity
payments are one of the fastest-growing benefits at a time when the nation's
overall health has been improving.
In the past 10 years the number of people receiving the benefit has risen
from 700,000 to 1.5m. Expenditure has more than doubled in real terms over
the same period to Pounds 6bn a year and is likely to reach Pounds 8bn by
1995-96.
All five commissioned studies of the benefit are expected to be completed in
the next two months, paving the way for a final decision about the time of
the November Budget.
The government may also decide in November to impose tax on the benefit. Mr
Burt said yesterday: 'There is no secret it has always been intended to tax
invalidity benefit. It is a matter for the chancellor at what stage he
brings it into tax.'
Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security secretary, accused the government of
a ploy to 'soften the public up for an autumn hatchet job on benefits to the
most vulnerable'.
The benefit - which is more than unemployment benefit - is typically paid to
men in their 50s who have lost their jobs and are seen by social security
officials as unfit for work.
