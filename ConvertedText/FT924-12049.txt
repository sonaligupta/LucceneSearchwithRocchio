FT  22 OCT 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market report


   By REUTER


BASE METALS continued to be underpinned by a short-term corrective reaction
following recent hefty price declines on the London Metal Exchange
yesterday. But the general fundamental picture of sluggish economies and
high stocks suggests the downside will be revisited soon, dealers said. The
markets are also pausing this week with many participants and traders
side-lined for LME dinner week. London COCOA futures made strong advances,
but ended with gains slightly pared. Dealers said the upward movement
carried on from Tuesday's key chart reversal in New York, which had prompted
an active short covering rally. In Chicago MAIZE continued to trade lower at
midsession, with the market focusing on the large crop and ignoring rumours
Ukraine has purchased 300,000 tonnes of corn, traders said. 'The modest
rally yesterday on the Russian purchase (of 820,000 tonnes of US corn)
proved this market is heading lower on the huge crop,' one trader said.
