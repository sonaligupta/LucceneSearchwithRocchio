quarter

   NEW YORK


Lockheed, the US defence group, yesterday reported a 21 per cent increase in
first-quarter net earnings.
It attributed the improved performance mainly to good results in its
aeronautical systems and electronic systems divisions.
The company made Dollars 92m, or Dollars 1.45 a share, compared with Dollars
76m, or Dollars 1.22 a share, in the same period of last year.
Revenues totalled Dollars 3bn, up 21 per cent on last year's Dollars 2.5bn.
Mr Daniel Tellep, chairman, said that the company had also produced
'significant positive cashflow and continued the rapid improvement in our
financial position'.
The company had generated net free cashflow after dividends of more than
Dollars 240m. At the end of the period, its net debt-to-capital ratio was 38
per cent, down from 48 per cent a year ago.
Programmes which had particularly strong first-quarter results included the
F-16 fighter, the C-130 Hercules transport aircraft and the F-22, the
new-generation fighter under development.
The total backlog at the end of the quarter was Dollars 28.2bn, down from
Dollars 28.9bn at the end of December.
Business other than US defence contracts rose to 39 per cent of sales at the
end of the quarter, compared with 34 per cent a year ago.
This amount included the group's sales to foreign governments, which made up
16 per cent of total revenues, compared with 10 per cent a year ago.
