FT  13 MAR 92 / Cumbrian bus plant sale sought


   By CHRIS TIGHE


THE WEST Cumbria Develop-ment Agency is this week launching a worldwide
marketing campaign for Volvo's unwanted bus factory at Workington in an
attempt to attract an inward investor to Cumbria's hard-hit coastal strip,
Chris Tighe writes.
With the financial backing of Swedish-owned Volvo, the WCDA is targeting the
US, Germany, Japan and Taiwan to find a buyer for the 500,000 sq ft plant.
No price has been specified, but Volvo said yesterday: 'We're looking for a
balance between getting a sensible price for it and trying to provide some
longer-term job security.'
The closure of the plant this year, with the loss of 370 jobs, follows the
slump in bus sales after deregulation. It is a serious blow to the economy
of West Cumbria, which is already losing 5,000 construction jobs from the
Sellafield nuclear reprocessing site and up to 7,000 jobs after cuts at
Trident submarine builder VSEL in Barrow-in-Furness.
