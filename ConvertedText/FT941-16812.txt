FT  07 JAN 94 / International Company News: US broker and bank resolve fund
dispute


   By PATRICK HARVERSON and REUTER


   NEW YORK


Smith Barney Shearson, the Wall Street brokerage house, and Mellon Bank, the
US banking group, have ended their row over who should administer mutual
funds from the old Shearson Lehman firm. They reached a settlement that will
allow the two companies to share the administration of the disputed funds.
The agreement concludes a four-month feud between the two companies.
Last month, Mellon had secured an injunction preventing Smith Barney
Shearson from diverting its mutual fund administration business away from
the Boston Company, the money management operation which Mellon bought from
Shearson for Dollars 1.45bn in 1992.
The injunction followed a lawsuit Mellon had filed contending that Smith
Barney Shearson had broken an agreement drawn up when Shearson merged with
Smith Barney in March 1993.
Under the terms of that pact, the Boston Company was to administer
Shearson's mutual funds, as had been agreed when the firm was sold to Mellon
the year before.
Under the settlement, however, Smith Barney Shearson agreed to pass on some
of the administrative business for its funds to the Boston Company. The two
sides said the agreement would last until May 2000.
Procter & Gamble of the US has acquired an additional 13 per cent stake in
the cleaning products maker Compania Qumica, a week after buying 74 per cent
of the Argentine company, Reuter reports.
No price or further details of the transaction were given.
