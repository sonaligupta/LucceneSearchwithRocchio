FT  23 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Jupiter fund management move


   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent


Jupiter Tyndall, the international fund management group, yesterday
announced its widely-expected acquisition of Queen Anne's Gate Asset
Management in a deal valued up to Pounds 10m cash.
Mr Charles Crowther and Mr Peter Adderson, directors of QAGAM, will become
directors of Jupiter.
QAGAM is the former fund management arm of the now-privatised water
companies; it has roughly Pounds 2bn in pension fund assets under
management.
In the year to March 31 it achieved profits of Pounds 300,000 and had net
assets of Pounds 800,000.
Although QAGAM has had above-average performance, it has only a few - but
very large - clients. Even the loss of one or two could have a significant
negative effect on profits and it has been seeking a buyer for several
months.
Jupiter's move is in line with its stated strategy of disposing of banking
businesses to concentrate on expanding fund management activities.
