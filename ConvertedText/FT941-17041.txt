FT  06 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Enterprise Oil raises Pounds 51m from
Ninian disposal


   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor


Enterprise Oil has sold its 18.5 per cent interest in the Ninian oilfield,
one of the North Sea's largest, to Chevron UK, Murphy Petroleum and Oryx UK,
three of the existing seven partners in the field. The price was Dollars 75m
(Pounds 50.6m).
Enterprise acquired the interest in 1986 when it bought ICI's exploration
and producing interests.
Mr Graham Hearne, Enterprise's chairman and chief executive, said the sale
formed part of the company's continuing programme of portfolio management.
Proceeds would be redeployed in the business.
Enterprise has been steadily unwinding its older North Sea assets. Last year
it sold its interests in the mature Hutton and North West Hutton fields. As
a result of these sales, it has relinquished its remaining interest in the
Sullum Voe oil terminal and the Brent and Ninian pipeline systems which feed
it. Its strategy is to use the proceeds of sales to fund acquisitions which
will enhance the quality of its oil portfolio.
Clyde Petroleum announced yesterday that it had sold its 1 per cent interest
in the Forties field to BP for about Pounds 5m.
Hamilton Oil has been given approval by the Department of Energy to develop
the Lennox oil and gas field in block 110/15 in Liverpool Bay. Monument Oil
and Gas has a 23.9 per cent interest in the block, which will be reduced to
20 per cent following completion of the sale of a 3.9 per cent interest to
PowerGen.
