FT  28 APR 94 / Observer: Makes Saenz


Emilio Ybarra, the coolly collected chairman of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, is
angry. On Monday night he lost out to Spanish banking's other Emilio  -
Banco Santander's Emilio Botin - in the takeover race for Banesto. Now Botin
has recruited BBV's brightest and best to manage the bauble.
Alfredo Saenz, whom Botin has appointed Banesto's chief executive, was a BBV
vice-chairman until seconded by Ybarra to rebuild Banesto, after the Bank of
Spain recently sacked the board of the ailing bank. So what does a grateful
Bank of Spain do? Hand Banesto to BBV on a plate?
Not likely. We are witnessing commercial Spain's hard new realism; Santander
outgunned BBV.
Unsurprisingly, Ybarra wanted Saenz back; tough tapas. Botin's promise to
distribute 1 per cent of Banesto's stock among its senior directors clearly
concentrated Saenz's mind.
We may now see a steady haemorrhaging of Saenz-picked BBV talent into the
Santander-Banesto cup.
How history repeats itself. Three years ago the government chose Francisco
Luzon, another BBV high-flier, to run the partially-privatised Argentaria.
Since then, Luzon has poached some 70 clever managers from his former
employers.
