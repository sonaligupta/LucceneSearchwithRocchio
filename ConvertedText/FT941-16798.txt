FT  07 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: CBoT aims to share in lumber
boom


   By LAURIE MORSE


   CHICAGO


The Chicago Board of Trade, hoping to cash in on the recently boisterous
performance of the lumber market, will introduce on 25 January futures on an
index of structural panel prices. The contract, a revamp of the exchange's
old plywood futures contract, will be based on an index of prices for US
southern yellow pine plywood and oriented strand board. It will be settled
in cash, rather than with physical delivery.
Structural panels are used extensively in US home building, an area of the
US economy that has begun to rebound. The structural panel index will
reflect forest product prices in the south and eastern US.
