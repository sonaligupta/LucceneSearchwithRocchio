FT  23 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Eliza Tinsley jumps 40%


Eliza Tinsley, USM-quoted maker of hardware products, returned pre-tax
profits of Pounds 713,000 for the year ended March 31 1993, a 40 per cent
increase on last time's Pounds 510,000. The improvement maintained the
progress shown at the halfway stage.
Turnover declined from Pounds 15.7m to Pounds 15.1m. At the operating level
profits were lower at Pounds 867,000 (Pounds 917,000), squeezed by pressure
on margins, which was not offset by overheads reduced by Pounds 250,000, and
improved control systems.
The 1991-92 operating profit was before reorganisation costs of Pounds
249,000. The results were drawn up in accordance with FRS 3 accounting
standards.
The dividend is increased from 5.2p to 5.45p, with a final of 3.65p, paid
from earnings of 6.62p (4.72p).
The shares closed 10p lower at 97p.
