FT  27 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Tibbett & Britten drives ahead 15% to
Pounds 13.5m


   By BRONWEN MADDOX


TIBBETT & BRITTEN Group, the clothing and grocery distribution company,
reported a 15 per cent jump in pre-tax profits in 1991, from Pounds 11.7m to
Pounds 13.5m, as acquisitions and interest received on cash balances helped
compensate for tough conditions in clothing.
The rise was achieved on a 16 per cent increase in turnover to Pounds 181.2m
(Pounds 155.6m). The group said that 80 per cent of the new revenue came
from organic growth, helped by new contracts with Marks and Spencer and J
Sainsbury.
Nevertheless, operating margins fell to 6.9 per cent (7.2 per cent) mainly
because of pressure in clothing and textiles, which make up just under half
of group revenue. Although overseas and distribution for individual clients
performed well, shared-network distribution, about a fifth of the clothing
division, became unprofitable as volumes and prices fell.
The retail consolidation division, which handles electrical and non-food
goods, saw revenues up by 30 per cent following previous investment in
warehousing for the B&Q Retail DIY chain, and a new contract from Digital
Equipment Company.
Lowfield Distribution, which handles foodstuffs, saw turnover rise 12 per
cent, helped by the acquisition of a further contract from J Sainsbury.
Capital expenditure at Pounds 14m was some Pounds 6m lower than in previous
years, but the company also spent Pounds 6m on acquisitions, mainly a
regional distribution centre for Marks and Spencer.
However interest receivable still increased to Pounds 984,000 (Pounds
354,000).
Mr John Harvey, chairman, warned that '1992 will not be an easy year' but
added that 'tough conditions create change, and change helps us.'
Helped by a slight fall in the tax charge, earnings rose by 14 per cent to
25.7p (22.5p). A final dividend of 7.4p marked a 17 per cent rise in the
total dividend to 10.8p (9.2p).
