FT  20 APR 91 / Finance & The Family: Oil sector picks up


   By JOHN AUTHERS


Oil stocks have not done well since peace broke out. The share prices of
companies in the oil and gas sector outperformed other All-Share companies
immediately after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, but then started a steady
decline. This was reversed last week.
The upturn in the price of crude oil, which led to a marked improvement in
sentiment among brokers' analysts, was mainly responsible. Some of the
revival is technical, as marketmakers had allowed themselves to reduce their
oil holdings, forcing them to push prices up when demand revived. Business
in BP was particularly strong thanks to speculation that the company is
trying to sell a US subsidiary.
