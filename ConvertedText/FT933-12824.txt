FT  22 JUL 93 / Letters To The Editor: Employee-shareholder control of wage
inflation


   From Mr PETER INGRAM


Sir, Ivan Cohen (Letters, July 13) takes issue with my suggestion that
institutional shareholders might be able to exert a beneficial influence on
wage bargaining on the grounds that these shareholdings are owned by the
employees affected. To criticise the proposal on these grounds is to miss
the point. Employees are too frequently the stake-holder in the company most
adversely affected by wage inflation. If employees, via their pension funds,
can exert a cost discipline that avoids inflationary wage outcomes, current
costly solutions such as high unemployment might be better avoided.
Mr Cohen is mistaking a desire to avoid inflationary wage growth for a
proposal to 'check wages'. The two are not the same thing. It is affordable
real wage growth that employees require and if employees, through their
shareholdings, can assist this process, while avoiding the distortion of
inflation and the existing remedy of unemployment, then it can only be to
their benefit as well as to that of the corporate sector as a whole.
