FT  27 MAY 93 / Peseta in sharp fall against D-Mark


   By PETER BRUCE

THE SPANISH peseta, devalued by 8 per cent in the exchange rate mechanism of
the European monetary system earlier this month, fell sharply against the
D-Mark yesterday as nervousness about the outcome of the June 6 election
returned to the markets.
The currency fell 155 basis points during the day to close at Pta77.85 to
the D-Mark, the lowest it has traded since the devaluation - the third in
nine months - on May 13.
Dealers said a forecast of further interest rate falls, following Tuesday's
small benchmark cut, by Mr Carlos Solchaga, the finance minister, had helped
weaken the peseta, along with market suspicions that the Bank of Spain had
been buying D-Marks in order to replenish its reserves.
But the movement yesterday raised the spectre of one further attack on the
currency before the election, especially as the opposition Partido Popular,
which may now be opening up a clear lead in opinion polls over the governing
Socialists, has consistently refused to make any clear statement on its
economic policy plans.
That has left markets worrying about remarks by PP leaders calling for quick
interest rate cuts of up to four points while at the same time displaying a
less than convincing commitment to holding the peseta inside the EMS. Polls
taken after a televised debate between its leader, Mr Jose Mara Aznar, and
Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez show that more than 50 per cent of the
country gave the debate to Mr Aznar and that the debate swayed a large
number of undecided voters to the conservatives.
