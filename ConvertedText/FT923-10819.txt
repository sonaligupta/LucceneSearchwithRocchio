midway


   By KAREN ZAGOR


   NEW YORK


MOBIL and Chevron, the second and fourth biggest US oil and gas groups
respectively, yesterday reported second quarter results that reflected the
squeezed margins and reorganisation charges that have been rampant in the
industry.
Mobil's net income dropped 43 per cent in the second quarter to Dollars
255m, or 60 cents a share, from Dollars 445m, or Dollars 1.08, a year
earlier. Stripping out special items in both years, operating profits fell
36 per cent to Dollars 255m from Dollars 401m.
Revenues rose 5 per cent to Dollars 15.19bn from Dollars 14.45bn in the
quarter.
The company earlier this month said it had slashed its capital appropriation
budget for the year an additional Dollars 800m to Dollars 4bn, compared with
Dollars 5.4bn the previous year.
Mobil's US marketing and refining business turned in a loss of Dollars 45m
in the quarter compared with earnings of Dollars 65m last year.
Overall marketing and refining operations brought in earnings of Dollars 25m
against Dollars 279m a year ago. The company's chemical earnings tumbled to
Dollars 18m from Dollars 61m.
For the first half, Mobil earned Dollars 382m compared with Dollars 1.16bn
last year. Stripping out extraordinary items in both years, first-half
operating earnings tumbled to Dollars 468m from Dollars 1.11bn.
Chevron, which is in the throes of a two-year restructuring effort, posted a
9 per cent decline in reported net income to Dollars 350m on revenues of
Dollars 10.6bn, compared with income of Dollars 384m on revenues of Dollars
9.7bn the previous year.
Earnings were muddied by special items which cut income by Dollars 39m in
the latest quarter. A year earlier, extraordinary gains were Dollars 120m.
Earnings per share eased to Dollars 1.03 from Dollars 1.09.
Chevron benefited from foreign exchange gains in the latest quarter, which
brought in Dollars 64m, compared with a loss of Dollars 16m a year earlier.
First half net income fell 30 per cent to Dollars 654m, or Dollars 1.91 a
share, from Dollars 941m, or Dollars 2.68, last year on revenues which eased
to Dollars 20.3bn from Dollars 20.5bn.
