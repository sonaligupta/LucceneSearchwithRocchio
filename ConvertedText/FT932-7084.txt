FT  26 MAY 93 / EC close to deal on works councils


   By DAVID GARDNER

BRITAIN'S 11 European Community partners are close to agreement on setting
up mandatory works councils in large trans-European companies, amid signs
that Britain's obdurate opposition to this extension of workers' rights may
be softening.
The controversial draft directive, stalled for over two years, will be
discussed by labour and social affairs ministers next Tuesday in Luxembourg.
The Danish presidency of the EC, while working for an agreement including
Britain, has set as its minimum goal a consensus among the 11. This would
allow them to implement the directive once the Maastricht treaty, and its
social protocol from which the UK is exempt, is ratified.
Britain faces the dilemma of fighting to dilute the directive, or see it
come into force without having shaped it. If the latter happened, British
companies would be among those most affected, as there are more than 100 in
continental Europe falling under the proposed rules. British multinationals
in Europe would also face pressure to introduce in the UK the consultation
procedures they would be obliged to follow on the continent.
The rules would oblige companies employing more than 1,000 workers in more
than one member state, and with more than 100 employees in at least two of
them, to set up elected works councils, which would have to be consulted on
jobs changes, new technology, investment and relocation plans, and 'any
proposal creating serious consequences for workers' interests.' Although the
directive has been made more flexible, with, for instance, provision for
workers and employers to make their own arrangements, the UK flatly opposes
making consultation obligatory.
Yet Britain appears to be keeping its options open, playing a full
negotiating role in recent meetings to discuss the directive, according to
the latest compromise document.
