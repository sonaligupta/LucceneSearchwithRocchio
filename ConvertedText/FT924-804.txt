FT  22 DEC 92 / Letter: Easing of Heathrow access may lead to air services
pact


   From Mr STEPHEN M WOLF


Sir, Your editorial concerning the proposed British Airways investment in
USAir ('Deal in the air', December 18) is right on the mark. It would be a
sad day for international aviation if the US and UK miss this opportunity to
break the log-jam on negotiations toward a liberalised agreement on air
services.
You have correctly identified the Heathrow access restrictions for US air
carriers as the primary obstacle to progress. We agree that if the UK
government is willing to eliminate this barrier, the deal can indeed 'be the
trigger' for a liberalisation of transatlantic air services from which all
would benefit.
