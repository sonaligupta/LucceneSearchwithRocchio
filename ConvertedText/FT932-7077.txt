FT  26 MAY 93 / West may yet use force, says Stoltenberg


   By ROBERT MAUTHNER


MR Thorvald Stoltenberg, the United Nations mediator, said yesterday that
the option of using military force to end the conflict in Bosnia had not
been abandoned by the international community, though other means to achieve
peace would be pursued first.
Speaking in Zagreb at the start of a tour of the war zones in the former
Yugoslavia, Mr Stoltenberg said it was wrong to assume, from the new
containment plan adopted by the western allies and Russia, that the use of
force to make the Bosnian Serbs give up their conquered territory had been
ruled out.
Meanwhile, Lord Owen, the European Community's representative on the two-man
international mediating team, remained silent about the future of the
Bosnian peace plan which he and Mr Cyrus Vance drew up.
Lord Owen's refusal to comment on the new international strategy to deal
with the Bosnian crisis, which many observers see as undermining the
Vance-Owen plan, has fuelled speculation that he might relinquish his role
as mediator.
However, diplomats in Geneva, venue of the Yugoslav peace conference, said
they saw no reason for Lord Owen to abandon his task since the EC continued
to back the Vance-Owen plan for a political settlement in Bosnia.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the British defence secretary, said yesterday that what
the west had done was to reverse its priorities, placing efforts to end the
fighting ahead of an immediate political settlement.
'Essentially we still have exactly the same destination, but we may be using
a different route to get there,' he said.
Meanwhile, Turkey said the new plan adopted by the US, Russia, France,
Britain and Spain was a 'waste of time.'
'The plan proposes no measures to stop the side which is determined to
continue its attacks and which has challenged the world,' the Turkish
foreign ministry said.
