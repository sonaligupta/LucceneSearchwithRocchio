FT  29 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Brown & Jackson in the black


BROWN & JACKSON, which operates the Poundstretcher discount stores, returned
to profits at the interim stage after suffering losses of Pounds 14.9m for
the previous nine month period.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to March 31 amounted to Pounds 1.75m on
sales of Pounds 106.3m. The dividend is passed, as indicated at the time of
the capital reconstruction. Earnings per share were 0.5p.
The result was not comparable with the last year's interim because the the
financial year has been changed to December 31.
The group will next announce results for the nine months to June 30. The
year end figures will be for the 15 months to December 31.
Mr Ian Grey, chief executive, warned against reading too much into the
current results. Historically, three out of the four quarters produce a
loss.
Poundstretcher's March quarter sales represented a like for like decline of
8 per cent over the previous period.
Earlier this year the group raised Pounds 15.6m through a placing and open
offer and disposed of both Advanced Technology Industries and A & G Imports.
