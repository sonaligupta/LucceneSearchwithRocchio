FT  05 MAR 94 / International Company News: Earnings rise 24% at Brierley
Investments


   By TERRY HALL


   WELLINGTON


Brierley Investments, of New Zealand, reported a 24 per cent rise in
earnings to NZDollars 140.4m (USDollars 79.9m) for the six months to
December 31, from NZDollars 112.7m a year ago.
The improvement was in spite of providing for a NZDollars 36m loss on the
sale of the group's 27 per cent interest in Dominion Breweries.
Directors said the main contribution to the rise in trading profits by
NZDollars 6m to NZDollars 148m was an improved performance from the
company's main investment, Mount Charlotte in the UK, and good performances
from Air New Zealand, Carter Holt Harvey, Sealord Products, and Australian
Consolidated Investments. They said the profit increase was achieved in
spite of reducing shareholdings in subsidiaries.
