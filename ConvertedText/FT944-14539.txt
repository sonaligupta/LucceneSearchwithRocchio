FT  22 OCT 94 / Tunnel hit by further setback


   By CHARLES BATCHELOR


The Channel tunnel project suffered another embarrassing setback yesterday
when a high-speed Eurostar train carrying the heads of British Rail and
Eurotunnel broke down, Charles Batchelor writes.
The Pounds 24m express train carrying Sir Bob Reid, British Rail chairman,
Sir Alastair Morton, co-chairman of Eurotunnel, and 350 other guests
developed a fault in the tunnel and was halted at Calais.
A replacement train was fetched but the travellers, including a party of 50
schoolchildren who had won a competition, were more than two hours late
arriving in Paris.
This is the third time in a week that a Eurostar train has broken down.
European Passenger Services, British partner in the railway consortium which
runs Eurostar, said early tests over several months had revealed very few
faults but new ones were starting to emerge.
It denied there was a design fault. The three breakdowns each had a
different cause with the problem yesterday traced to a mechanical fault.
