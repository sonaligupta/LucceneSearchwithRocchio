BTR Nylex, the quoted Australian offshoot of Britain's BTR group, yesterday
announced after-tax profits of ADollars 401.2m (USDollars 288.6m) for 1993,
a 9.8 per cent increase over 1992's ADollars 365.4m. Sales rose 8.4 per cent
to ADollars 6.21bn.
The diversified manufacturing group's operating profit, ahead of 'corporate
activities,' rose 7.7 per cent, to ADollars 855.2m. BTR Nylex attributed the
advance to 'the long-awaited improvement in economic conditions, together
with more efficient operating performance' in its core Australasian
businesses. It reported increased demand from customers in the automotive,
packaging and construction-related sectors.
Sales in Australasia rose to ADollars 3.27bn from ADollars 3.03bn, while
operating profit was ADollars 499.3m against ADollars 439.2m.
The North American interests also made progress, pushing up sales to
ADollars 1.12bn from ADollars 978.4m, and increasing operating profits to
ADollars 148.6m from ADollars 130.6m. BTR said new contracts at Continental
PET contributed to the advance.
However, operating profits in Asia were flat, at ADollars 117.3m against
ADollars 118.6m. The company said much of the region saw an improvement, but
that pricing and capacity pressures in Taiwan affected the polymer
businesses.
Europe took a larger profits tumble, down from ADollars 105.5m to ADollars
90m, a trend blamed on 'stagnant and competitive market conditions' and
restructuring disruptions at Rockware.
However, the group sounded a cheery note on current-year prospects, saying
the improving economies in North America and Australasia and the sustained
demand from Asia should be beneficial.
