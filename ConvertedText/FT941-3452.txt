FT  16 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Appearance is not everything


   From Mr DEREK C JENKINS


Sir, Colin Amery ('A lifeline for the South Bank', March 14) falls into the
trap which catches so many of those who write about architecture - he
assumes that external appearance is everything. In praising the Festival
Hall, while damning the Queen Elizabeth Hall and Hayward Gallery, he takes
no account of the ability of each building to fulfil its true function
successfully.
In the ways in which a concert hall can enhance a musical performance and
its enjoyment, by the musicians and audience, the RFH is the worst venue,
not just in London, but in all the main centres in Europe. The QEH, on the
other hand, ranks with the Wigmore as the best in this respect.
Among galleries, the Hayward exhibition space complements 20th century works
in a way that is matched by no other leading London site. To suggest that
buildings do not fulfil their real purpose superbly, merely because a vocal
section of opinion deems them to be ugly on the outside, is a very poor
application of values and priorities.
Derek C Jenkins.
