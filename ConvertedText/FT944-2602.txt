FT  16 DEC 94 / EU farm 'switchover' abolished

European Union farm ministers agreed yesterday to abolish the 'switchover'
mechanism, which has cushioned farm prices over the past decade at a cost of
Ecu6bn (Pounds 4.7bn). The switchover is part of the EU's system for
converting farm payments into national currencies. It operated to boost
agricultural prices by 21 per cent over the last 10 years as it revalues
farm payments to follow the upward movements of the strongest EU currency,
which was usually the D-Mark.
The German government, which was in favour of retaining the switchover,
managed to pass a compromise package which offers some compensation to
farmers for currency movements. The new rules compensate farmers if real
exchange rates move three percentage points below or five percentage points
above the green currency rate which is used for converting farm prices. The
compromise was passed against the view of the Commission and the UK
government, which, with Denmark, voted against the package.
