FT  02 JUL 92 / International Company News: Asko in DM413m write-off for
year


   By ANDREW FISHER


   FRANKFURT


ASKO, the expanding German retail group, took a DM413m (Dollars 258m)
write-off last year on the value of its holdings in other companies and is
paying no dividend, although its main activities turned in a sharply higher
operating profit.
The company said that DM200m of the provisions related to its stake in Adia,
the Swiss employment and services agency which was formerly owned by the
stricken Omni group of financier Mr Werner Rey.
Adia is now controlled by Asko and Mr Klaus Jacobs, the Swiss businessman.
A further DM45m of the write-offs was in Lonrho, the UK company. The result
of the provisions was to reduce Asko's group net profits from DM282m to
DM6m.
At the operating level, Asko turned in sharply higher profits of DM681m
against DM421m. Cash- flow was DM800m after DM494m last time.
For this year, Asko said it expected operating profits to be similar to
those of 1991. Restructuring at the self-service department stores and the
setting up of its TIP discount chain had eroded profits early in the year,
however.
Group sales in the first four months rose by 12 per cent, but Asko gave no
figures. In 1991, turnover was DM18bn (DM10.9bn).
Shares of the company were suspended on Monday pending the announcement of
the write-offs and the decision to pay no dividend after last year's
distribution of DM17 per voting share and DM19 per preference unit.
Asko has said it intended to concentrate in future on its main store, food,
do-it-yourself, furniture, and clothing activities and shed peripheral
operations. It is opening 65 new stores this year.
