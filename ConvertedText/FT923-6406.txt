FT  25 AUG 92 / Print group to talk with union


   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor


THE ST IVES printing group has agreed to formal talks with the GPMU print
union about the use of casual or temporary labour in its magazine division.
The agreement to talk follows a GPMU ballot on industrial action after the
company refused to stop hiring casual staff in the unskilled finishing area
at Pounds 3 an hour, compared with the usual Pounds 5.85.
The 1,000 GPMU members who work in the seven St Ives web-offset plants -
printing magazines such as the Economist, Company and New Woman  - voted
overwhelmingly in favour of industrial action short of a strike and by a far
smaller majority in favour of strike action.
Mr Tony Dubbins, GPMU general secretary, said that after the company's
positive response to a request for talks no industrial action was being
considered.
The union hopes to negotiate a group-wide agreement on the limited use of
casual labour with St Ives and so block any wider move to casualisation in
the industry.
