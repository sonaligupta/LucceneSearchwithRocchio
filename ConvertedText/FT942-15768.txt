FT  14 APR 94 / Russia investment tax worry


   By LEYLA BOULTON

A senior Russian minister yesterday evaded western companies' worries that
they may have to pay an 18.7 per cent tax on investments in Russia at a time
when the country says it is desperate for foreign capital. Foreign
investment may be affected by the December presidential decree which taxed
loans in an attempt to fight Russian enterprises dodging VAT by making
tax-free payments in the form of fake 'loans'.
Mr Steve Hasson, tax partner at Price Waterhouse, said the new Russian move
could 'hit inter-company loans from western parent companies to a Russian
subsidiary, loans from the EBRD and the World Bank, as well as western
commercial bank loans.' Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy prime minister
responsible for the economy, hoped that President Boris Yeltsin's earlier
decree to protect existing foreign investment from mid-stream tax changes
would override the latest decree.
