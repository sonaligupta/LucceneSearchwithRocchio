FT  22 APR 91 / International Company News: Sale Tilney moves to staunch
losses from UK food side


   By STEVE THOMPSON


SALE TILNEY, the mini-conglomerate whose businesses cover the manufacture
and distribution of engineering products, the importing, processing and
distribution of foods, and insurance broking, has moved quickly to staunch
the losses from its UK food operation.
It has brought in a new head for that division, appointing Mr Roger Begy to
lead the foods subsidiary, Peabody Foods.
That subsidiary was almost entirely responsible for the Sale Tilney group
pre-tax losses, reported last month, of Pounds 9.6m for the year ended to
November 30 1990. It accounted for Pounds 9.08m, after taking in exceptional
provisions of Pounds 5.07m.
Mr Begy's is the first senior appointment at Sale Tilney made by Mr Andrew
Coppel, the company chief executive who was appointed in October last year.
He is viewed as the key figure in returning Peabody to profitability.
A food industry specialist, Mr Begy moves to Sale from Berisford
International where he was deputy managing director of Bristar, the food and
ingredient division.
Previously he headed a major marketing reorganisation of British Sugar's
industrial sugars division, and then became executive director of sales and
marketing at British Sugar.
Other senior management changes are expected shortly at Sale Tilney where Mr
Coppel, formerly finance director at Ratners, the high street jewellery
chain, is in the process of rebuilding the main board.
