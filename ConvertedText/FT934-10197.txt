FT  06 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Takeover talk lifts TV stocks


TAKEOVER fervour gripped television stocks as belief grew that the
government would relax the rules that currently prevent the largest ITV
companies taking each other over.
A flurry of activity swept across all stocks in the sector, focusing on
those where bid rumours had circulated for some time. Investor interest was
said to have come from across the board.
Anglia rose 14 to 394p on speculation that the way would be clearer for
Carlton to move in. While a higher increase may have been anticipated, one
analyst said that quite an amount of bid expectation had already been
factored into the price. Carlton remained unchanged on the day.
LWT Holdings moved ahead 15 to 499p on hopes of a bid from Granada, while
the latter stock fell back 7 to 475p. Central was a good performer, moving
ahead 25 to 2058p. Yorkshire showed a rally on its previous form and pushed
up 13 to 183p.
Suggestions that Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland might be excluded from
any changes to the present system saw HTV slip 2 to 86p, although Scottish
managed to firm 2 to 440p.
