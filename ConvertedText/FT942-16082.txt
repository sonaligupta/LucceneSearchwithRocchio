FT  12 APR 94 / International Company News: Alcatel, Pirelli in Stet sale
talks

Alcatel Alsthom, the French telecommunications, energy and transport
company, is planning to join with Pirelli, the Italian tyres and cables
manufacturer, to participate in the privatisation of Stet, Italy's
state-owned telecoms group.
Alcatel said yesterday that it had 'responded favourably' to a proposition
by Pirelli that they should co-operate in the privatisation, but said no
formal alliance had yet been set up. Pirelli declined to comment.
The privatisation of Stet, 52 per cent of which belongs to IRI, the Italian
state holding company, is expected before the end of the year.
A spokesman for the French group said Alcatel was keen to expand in Italy,
where it is already the second largest supplier of telecommunications
equipment, in spite of current problems in the market.
However, it will be up to Italy's new government to finalise terms for the
privatisation, likely to be one of the biggest and most controversial in the
current series of sales.
In August, five of Italy's state-controlled telecoms operators will be
merged into a single company, Telecom Italia, which will be Stet's principal
asset. But the more sensitive question of the conditions for the sale of
IRI's stake has not yet been settled.
Mr Pierre Suard, Alcatel's chairman, has cited difficult conditions in Italy
and a fall in sales there as one of the reasons for an expected decline in
net profits this year. But a spokesman said that the downturn was largely
the result of economic conditions and that the market retained a strong
potential for growth.
An alliance with Pirelli would extend Alcatel's existing ties with Italian
industry.
