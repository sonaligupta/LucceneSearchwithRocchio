FT  29 JAN 92 / International Company News: Phelps Dodge reports sharply
lower earnings


   By BARBARA DURR


PHELPS DODGE, the world's second largest producer of copper and a leading
fabricator of metal products, reported sharply lower earnings in 1991
because of lower prices for copper and higher production costs.
Results were also held down by reduced prices for carbon blacks, used for
toughening rubber for tyres, and fewer sales of truck wheels and rims to the
recession-hit US automotive industry.
For 1991, net income was Dollars 272.9m, or Dollars 7.86 a share, down from
Dollars 454.9m, or Dollars 13.12, in 1990. Sales were Dollars 2.43bn for
1991, against Dollars 2.63bn in 1990.
Mr Douglas Yearley, chairman, said last year's results were 'gratifying in
light of the state of the world economy'.
He praised the mining division for its solid performance in spite of a 14
cents drop in the average price per pound of copper to Dollars 1.05 in 1991.
The division suffered from higher production costs related to lower ore
grades treated at its Tyrone mine in New Mexico and higher stripping ratios
at its Morenci mine in Arizona.
In the fourth quarter, consolidated net income was Dollars 75.2m, or Dollars
2.16 a share, against Dollars 102.9m, or Dollars 2.98. This included Dollars
8.8m after taxes from a dividend on its 16.2 per cent interest in Southern
Peru Copper. Fourth-quarter sales fell to Dollars 613.3m from Dollars 636.1m
in 1990.
