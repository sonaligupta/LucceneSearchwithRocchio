FT  15 APR 94 / Sale reflects low property yields


   By VANESSA HOULDER


Gartmore House, a 23,000 sq ft office block near the Monument, in London, is
being sold for about Pounds 10m, Vanessa Houlder writes.
The deal reflects the strength of demand for good-quality property, which
has pushed City property yields - the ratio of income to capital  - down to
the lowest levels for several years.
Gartmore House, occupied by Gartmore Investment Management and Bass
Holdings, is being sold on a yield of below 6.5 per cent.
Separately, Baltic House, a 53,000 sq ft building in Leadenhall Street, has
been sold to AMP Asset Management for Pounds 20m, on a yield of 6.75 per
cent. The building was sold by a private Dutch company which bought the
building 11 months ago for Pounds 13.8m.
However, the top prices being paid for City buildings are about half those
at the peak of the market in 1989, when deals were struck at prices of
Pounds 1,200 per sq ft.
