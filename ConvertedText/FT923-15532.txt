Bahrain-based offshore banking unit, to establish a joint venture Islamic
bank in the country with an authorised capital of Dollars 100m, writes Mark
Nicholson.
Mr Ilir Burhan Hoti, Albania's central bank governor, signed the deal in
Jeddah to establish the bank in which AIB will hold a 40 per cent stake and
take the management contract, with Albania holding the remainder.
The bank will be the first of its type in the predominantly Moslem state.
