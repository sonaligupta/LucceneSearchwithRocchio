FT  24 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Welsh torrents - Ballot Box


Ten years ago Nicholas Edwards, as Welsh secretary, appointed John Elfed
Jones as chairman of the Welsh Water Authority. Edwards, now Lord
Crickhowell, moved on to be chairman of the National Rivers Authority and
Jones became chairman of the privatised company.
Their paths have crossed again. The rivers authority has suggested that
water from Wales should be piped to help relieve the drought over the
border. Water is an emotive subject in Wales. Birmingham and Liverpool, and
other parts of England already get a large part of their supplies from Welsh
dams - free. The Welsh have always said England should pay for it.
Now Jones has told his erstwhile boss that the government ban on Wales
earning what it can from one of the few commodities it has in abundance has
cost the country Pounds 50m over the years. Pay for it or look elsewhere for
your water, he has said.
All of which is manna to the Liberal Democrats. 'If Welsh Water is taken, it
will be the end of the Tories in Wales,' says Richard Livsey, Liberal
Democrat MP for Brecon and Radnor.
