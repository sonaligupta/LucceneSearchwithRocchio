FT  07 JAN 94 / Government Bonds: Jobs data help Treasuries rebound


   By FRANK MCGURTY and CONNER MIDDELMANN


   NEW YORK, LONDON


US Treasury bonds rebounded yesterday after Mr Robert Reich, labor
secretary, said today's employment data would show fewer jobs in December
had been created than the market had feared.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was ahead at 98 21/32
, with the yield slipping to 6.346 per cent. At the short end, the two-year
note was  1/8 higher at 100 1/32 , to yield 4.216 per cent.
Mr Reich said he expected non-farm payrolls to have risen last month by
160,000 to 200,000, below the consensus forecast of 225,000. His remarks
eased the market's concern over the pace of economic acceleration, although
the effect was undermined when Mr Reich added that he had not seen the
report.
In another development, the Labor Department said initial claims for
unemployment benefit had increased by 70,000 in the last week of 1993, after
a 39,000 decline the previous week. Although the data were distorted by
seasonal factors, the market interpreted the increase as a sign that recent
anxiety over inflation may have been premature.
The recent sell-off in Europe's bond markets came to a halt yesterday,
helped by the firmer tone in US Treasuries. Trading was thin, however, with
markets in Spain, Italy, Sweden, Finland, Austria and parts of Germany
closed for the Epiphany holiday.
The Bundesbank's decision to leave its key interest rates unchanged caused
the German yield curve to flatten slightly as market participants trimmed
their hopes for a cut in interest rates soon.
At its first meeting this year, the central bank council held its discount
rate at 5.75 per cent and its Lombard rate at 6.75 per cent, and announced
another two rounds of securities repurchase agreements at a fixed rate of 6
per cent. This continues a policy begun on December 2, when the bank set a
five-week series of 6 per cent repos.
The long end of the bund market firmed as traders covered speculative short
positions while medium maturities weakened slightly. The March bund futures
contract ended at 100.79, down 0.05 point.
The strength of their currencies against the D-Mark enabled the Belgian and
Dutch central banks to cut their interest rates, giving a slight lift to
both countries' bond markets.
Belgium lowered its key central rate by 15 basis points to 7.10 per cent,
and cut its overnight and emergency lending rates by 25 basis points to 8.70
per cent and 11.25 per cent, respectively.
The Netherlands cut its special advances rate by 10 basis points to 5.5 per
cent and its secured advances rate by 25 basis points to 5.25 per cent.
French government bonds ended the day slightly lower after the market
digested a total of FFr20.24bn in new long-dated bonds. The FFr15.67bn of
5.5 per cent 10-year OAT's met with more investor demand than the FFr4.57bn
of 8.5 per cent 30-year bonds, traders said.
The March notional futures contract on Matif ended at 130.32, down 0.06.
UK gilts ended a quiet day little changed, with the yield curve flattening
slightly after the Bundesbank left rates unchanged. Flows were thin, with
investors reluctant to take fresh positions ahead of a raft of data due to
be released from next week. The March long gilt futures contract rose  5/32
to 118 29/32 .
Japanese government bonds had a strong day, boosted by the successful
auction of Y1,000bn 3.4 per cent 10-year bonds and a short-squeeze in the
futures pits. The March JGB futures contract rose 0.48 point at 117.68.
