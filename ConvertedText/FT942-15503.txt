FT  14 APR 94 / International Company News: First Chicago hampered


   By REUTER


   NEW YORK


First Chicago, the US bank, reported improved first-quarter earnings, but
said its results were hurt by its emerging markets trading unit, Reuter
reports from New York.
'Extreme volatility in global financial markets in the quarter led to a
(Dollars 25m) loss in this unit that more than offset profits in other
trading activities,' said Mr Richard Thomas, chairman.
A year ago, trading activities resulted in a gain of Dollars 54.5m.
First Chicago reported first-quarter fully-diluted earnings of Dollars 2 a
share, up from Dollars 1.91.
