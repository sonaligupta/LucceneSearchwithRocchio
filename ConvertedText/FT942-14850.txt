FT  19 APR 94 / Calls grow for Haiti invasion


   By REUTER


   WASHINGTON


A second US congressman has raised the issue of an American military
invasion of Haiti, Reuter reports from Washington.
Senator John Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat, said on Sunday: 'I don't think
it is the first step, but it is certainly high on my list of options,
depending on what the scenario afterwards would be.'
Last week, Representative David Obey said US forces should invade Haiti to
remove its military government.
