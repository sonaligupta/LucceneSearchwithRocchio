FT  27 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Hobson Pounds 0.54m in the red


Hobson, which on Tuesday responded to 'the significant rise' in its share
price by announcing that it was 'in negotiations for the acquisition of a
very substantial business', yesterday revealed increased losses for the six
months to September 30.
The shares fell  1/2 p to 20 1/2 p, having risen from 17p on January 20.
The USM-quoted company which has withdrawn from its personal care business,
saw losses before and after tax increase from Pounds 8,000 to Pounds 544,000
largely as a result of operating losses in the discontinued division rising
from Pounds 6,000 to Pounds 506,000 on turnover down from Pounds 713,000 to
Pounds 434,000.
Hobson is now left with its household products and commodities trading
operations.
In its first year the former made Pounds 51,000 on turnover of Pounds
398,000 while profits for the latter fell to Pounds 12,000 (Pounds 52,000)
on turnover reduced to Pounds 792,000 (Pounds 2.37m).
Losses per share emerged at 0.64p (0.02p).
