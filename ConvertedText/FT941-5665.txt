FT  05 MAR 94 / Benelux warning on votes hurdle to EU enlargement


   By DAVID GARDNER


   BRUSSELS


Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg have warned their European Union
partners they will not be able to get their parliaments to admit four new EU
members if Britain and Spain insist on the same voting rules of a Europe of
12 for a union of 16 countries.
Sweden, Finland and Austria agreed on Tuesday the terms on which they will
enter the EU next January. The Union resumes membership negotiations
tomorrow with Norway, which is holding out for special treatment in
sensitive areas such as fisheries resources.
But the issue of the so-called 'blocking minority' - the number of votes
needed to block legislation in the EU's Council of Ministers - could decide
whether the enlargement goes ahead at all. The British and, with nuances,
the Spanish want to keep the existing value of their votes in the qualified
majority voting system. Under this system, which allocates votes in the
Council according to the size of states, two large states and one small one
can combine their votes to block the rest.
Foreign ministers of the 12 must resolve the voting controversy when they
meet in Brussels on Monday and Tuesday.
By Thursday the European Parliament will decide whether to proceed with its
mandatory ratification of the accession treaty in time for the newcomers to
enter in January. The parliament has said it will not go ahead if the voting
rules stay as they are.
The four newcomers will have difficulty selling EU membership to their
citizens in referendums each has pledged to hold this year. But now the
voting dispute has raised a new obstacle at the level of national
parliaments - all of which have to endorse the wider Union.
