FT  30 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: A fan of index funds


John Bogle, chairman of the Dollars 125bn Vanguard group of funds in the US,
is a fan of index funds. In his book, Bogle on Mutual Funds, (Irwin
Professional Publishing, New York, Dollars 25) he argues that the fees
charged by many mutual funds are too high, particularly since they have
attracted inc- reasingly large sums of money in recent years. By investing
in an index fund you avoid these high charges. Bogle believes history shows
that index funds will consistently do better than individual managers with
comparable objectives.
