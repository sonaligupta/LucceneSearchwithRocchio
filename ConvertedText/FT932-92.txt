FT  30 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Aukett cuts operating deficit


CONCENTRATING on corporate markets is beginning to show benefits for Aukett
Associates, which provides integrated design and management services.
In the six months ended March 31 it cut its operating loss from Pounds
372,000 to Pounds 136,000. There were no exceptional charges this time,
against Pounds 202,000.
However, the pre-tax deficit doubled to Pounds 2.35m (Pounds 1.16m) after
losses of Pounds 2.1m on sale of discontinued operation (Pounds 586,000
against investment in associate), losses from associates of Pounds 124,000
(Pounds 129,000), and net interest payable of Pounds 32,000 (Pounds 70,000).
Mr Gerry Deighton, chairman, said he could not judge whether the company had
turned the corner, but believed current signs were encouraging.
Reductions in operating costs implemented over the past 18 months were
expected to show real benefits over the next 12 months.
They will be further enhanced by the 'considerable reduction' in borrowings
following the sale of Nathaniel Lichfield to management for Pounds 1m.
Losses per share came to 16.91p (7.31p).
