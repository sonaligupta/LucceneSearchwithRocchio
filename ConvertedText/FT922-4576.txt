FT  04 JUN 92 / International Company News: Bristol-Myers says lawsuits
without merit


   By REUTER


BRISTOL-MYERS Squibb, the US pharmaceuticals company, said there was 'no
basis for the allegations' in the lawsuits filed against the company,
Reuters reports.
The company was responding to earlier published reports that shareholders
had filed at least five lawsuits alleging executives did not publicly
release important information.
On June 2 Bristol-Myers' stock dropped sharply after it said 1992 earnings
would be below earlier analysts' estimates because of wholesaler inventory
problems.
