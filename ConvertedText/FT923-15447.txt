FT  02 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Teredo Petroleum falls to Pounds 91,000


Teredo Petroleum has changed its focus to concentrate on enhancing revenues
from producing areas and in line with this is altering its fixed assets
accounting policy.
The USM-quoted oil and gas producer saw pre-tax profits decline by 43 per
cent to Pounds 91,000 (Pounds 160,000 restated) in the half year to March
31, after exceptional costs of Pounds 65,000 connected to its reorganisation
under which exploration activity has been curtailed and staffing levels
reduced.
Sales in the six months declined to Pounds 2.75m (Pounds 3.1m). Provisions
for exploration costs fell to Pounds 414,000 (Pounds 486,000) and interest
payments and exchange losses took Pounds 142,000 (Pounds 73,000).
Earnings fell to 0.3p (0.5p) per share.
The company said that the 'successful efforts' accounting policy reflected
the fact that the speculative exploration stage had been completed. A charge
of Pounds 18.8m had been made against reserves as a result of the change.
