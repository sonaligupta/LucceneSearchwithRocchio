FT  14 APR 94 / Observer: Thinking time


Who will be the next director of the left-leaning think-tank, the Institute
for Public Policy Research, now that James Cornford is off to the richer
pastures of the Paul Hamlyn Foundation?
Patricia Hewitt, the current deputy director, must be the favourite. As Neil
Kinnock's former press secretary, she combines a keenly analytical mind with
inside knowledge of Labour politics. More important, she is more telegenic
than Cornford.
Unfortunately, she doesn't suffer fools gladly and may be penalised because
she's associated too much with yesterday's man. A safe alternative would be
David Ward, John Smith's youthful policy assistant. He's an effective fixer
who could be relied upon not to rock the boat.
If Labour won the next election, he could move seamlessly into Sarah Hogg's
role as head of the No 10 Policy Unit.
