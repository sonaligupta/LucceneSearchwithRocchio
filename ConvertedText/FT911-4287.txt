FT  19 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow takes a break after
Wednesday's record close


Wall Street
AFTER the big gains of Tuesday and Wednesday share prices slipped back
yesterday to leave the leading indices just below their new record levels,
writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 5.20 at 2,999.26. On
two occasions in the morning the Dow dropped below 3,000, then it recovered
to post a new high mid-afternoon, only to drop back amid late selling. The
broader-based Standard & Poor's 500 spent the first half of the day in
negative territory, standing down 1.99 at 388.46, while the Nasdaq composite
of over-the-counter stocks was down 4.69 at 506.62. Turnover on the New York
SE was again heavy at 219m shares, with declining issues outnumbering
advancing issues by 923 to 684.
Two pieces of encouraging economic news failed to lift the market. The
latest jobless claims figures, for the week ending April 6, showed a 22,000
fall in the number of people claiming state unemployment insurance. Analysts
had been expecting the number to rise. The February trade deficit narrowed
to Dollars 5.3bn, the smallest since September 1983. Although the data
should have boosted optimism about the economy market sentiment remained
subdued, primarily because much of the coverage of the Dow's record close on
Wednesday suggested that the rally did not have much further to go.
Hasbro shares, traded on the American Stock Exchange, rose Dollars 2 to
Dollars 29 1/2 after the company said it had received more t approval from
Tonka bondholders for its cash tender offer. Tonka rose early on but
eventually ended unchanged at Dollars 4 3/4 on volume of 1.8m shares.
A batch of mixed quarterly results in the technology sector caused a stir.
Digital Equipment jumped Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 69 3/4 on volume of 2.1m
shares after the computer group announced fiscal third quarter income of 94
cents a share, up from 20 cents a share a year earlier. Tandem Computers
climbed Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 16 on news of fiscal second quarter net
earnings of 17 cents a share, against 25 cents a share the year before.
Texas Instruments fell Dollars 1 to Dollars 45 as it reported a first
quarter loss.
Sears, Roebuck rose Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 39 1/2 after the retailing
giant announced first quarter profits of 59 cents a share, which included a
charge against earnings. Lockheed fell Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 41 7/8 on
news that first quarter profits had fallen from Dollars 1.09 a year ago to
85 cents a share. Schering-Plough, the pharmaceutical and healthcare group,
fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 49 3/4 in the wake of an 19 per cent increase
in quarterly income to 79 cents a share.
Canada
TORONTO shares sagged from the opening bell, staged a brief rally then
faded, closing slightly lower in moderate trading. The TSE 300 composite
closed down 12.00 points to end the day at 3533.93, as declines led advances
by 293 to 270. Volume of 35.4m shares, which was boosted by trading in three
penny stocks, beat Wednesday's 28.56m shares and trading value fell to
CDollars 359.4m (CDollars 367m).
The transportation group lost 2.19 per cent for the biggest decline among
the sub-indices, followed by gold issues, off 1.22 per cent.
