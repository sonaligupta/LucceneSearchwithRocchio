French shoemaker

   HONG KONG, PARIS


DICKSON Concepts, the up-market Hong Kong retailer, will pursue its strategy
of buying high-quality international brands despite its withdrawal yesterday
from a HKDollars 235m (USDollars 30.39m) rescue bid for Charles Jourdan, one
of France's leading shoemakers.
Dickson agreed terms in April to acquire Jourdan, which has for several
years been in financial difficulty, from Birsina Holding, a private Swiss
company. Announcing the move, Mr Dickson Poon, the chairman, said the
decision had been taken after completing a close examination of Charles
Jourdan's financial position.
Mr Dickson Poon, chairman, said his company had come to the decision that
proceeding with the bid was not in the best interests of his shareholders.
He said confidentiality agreements precluded him from giving detailed
reasons for his withdrawal.
'Our objectives are clearly stated and we have no plans to alter them,' said
Mr Poon. 'We will not buy for the sake of buying, but if and when the right
opportunity arises we will pursue it.'
Hong Kong analysts estimate that Dickson has net cash reserves of around
Dollars HK400m. On Monday, the company will report its results for the year
to March 31. Analysts are expecting net profits of between HKDollars 265m
and HKDollars 290m. This compares with earnings of HKDollars 243m in the
previous year.
Dickson Concepts is a niche retailer of luxury products. It has an exclusive
licence to retail the products of ST Dupont in Hong Kong and Japan. Last
October, the group acquired Harvey Nichols, the luxury London department
store from the embattled Burton Group, for Pounds 53.7m (USDollars 99.34m)
Jourdan, known worldwide for its classic women's shoes, said yesterday it
had 'no immediate plans' to look for another financial partner.
