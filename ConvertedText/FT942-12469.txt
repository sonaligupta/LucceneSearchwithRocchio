FT  29 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: A suspicious quality


   From Mr D T WIGGINS


Sir, I read with interest the letter from Ms Chrissie Loveday (April 23)
regarding the BS5750 certificate - which she is beginning to learn to hate.
From the commercial point of view, BS5750 seems to have spawned a whole
industry of so-called consultants and would-be advisers.
Unfortunately, there does not seem to be any published list of those
companies which have failed to maintain their standards and have been
de-listed. In fact, what started out as a sound system has turned into a
bandwagon, which is being jumped upon, purely for would-be bureaucrats - as
there is no real method to provide an audit after the gaining of a
certificate.
We are now regarding, with some suspicion, would-be suppliers which boast on
their letterhead the dreaded number. It does not guarantee either quality or
standard.
