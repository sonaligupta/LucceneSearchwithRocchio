FT  21 JUL 94 / Arts: Today's Television


   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY


Since 1982 more than 100m Swatches have been sold worldwide, and today
children at fee paying schools are more likely to collect the Swiss fashion
accessory than stamps. The Business looks at the plastic phenomenon which is
credited with saving the Swiss watch industry and considers plans for the
Swatchmobile city car (7.30 BBC2). The last of the present series of
Hypotheticals is concerned with euthanasia (8.00 BBC2). ITV begins another
new comedy series: Downwardly Mobile in which poor but happy Rosemary
(Frances de la Tour) and Clem find themselves providing house room for
Clem's whiz kid brother and his insensitive wife Sophie (Josie Lawrence)
(8.30). Modernising zoos probably comes pretty low down the list of
priorities in the ex-communist east European states, yet the horrific
pictures shown so far in State Of The Ark suggest that, if more humanity is
one of the aims of the new states, then perhaps better treatment of animals
in confinement should come quite high up the list. Today's programme (9.30
BBC2) visits zoos in Romania and Armenia.
