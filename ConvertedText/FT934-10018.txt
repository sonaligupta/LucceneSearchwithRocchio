FT  08 NOV 93 / People: Gray joins Sutherland


Alan Gray, one of the best known analysts of the Scotch whisky industry, has
shifted his berth within the Scottish stockbroking fraternity. He has joined
Sutherland & Partners in Edinburgh, having left Charterhouse Tilney in
Glasgow which had absorbed his long-standing employer Campbell Neill.
Gray is probably the only analyst who concentrates purely on Scotch whisky.
Each year he puts out a 100-page annual whisky industry review, a
densely-printed volume covering not just quoted companies but also facts and
figures on distilleries, brand sales and industry trends, which costs Pounds
295. Gray, who has been following whisky for 25 years, prepares it
single-handed. He says it sells not just to investors but to companies
involved in the whisky industry, from bottle makers to PR firms.
Sutherland & Partners is a small institutional agency broker founded in 1989
with clients in Britain and abroad. It employs about 25 people; it now has
four analysts.
