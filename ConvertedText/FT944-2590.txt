FT  16 DEC 94 / Zimbabwe convertibility move


   By TONY HAWKINS

Zimbabwe will move to full current account convertibility from January 1
with the liberalisation of dividend remittances and regulations covering
domestic borrowing by foreign - owned companies. The changes, announced by
Mr John Nkomo, acting finance minister, mean that foreign companies, which
invested in Zimbabwe before May 1, 1993, will be permitted to remit 100 per
cent of after-tax profits instead of 50 per cent as at present.
The relaxation applies only to dividends declared after January 1 and puts
all foreign-owned companies on the same footing. In the past, only companies
that invested since May 1993 were entitled to full dividend remittability.
Latest figures show Zimbabwe's net foreign asset position has improved from
minus Dollars 470m a year ago to a positive Dollars 3m. The country now has
foreign exchange reserves covering eight months imports.
