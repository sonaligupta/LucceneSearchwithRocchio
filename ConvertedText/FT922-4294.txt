FT  06 JUN 92 / TGWU opposes Labour reforms


   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor


THE TGWU general union, Britain's biggest union and the largest affiliate to
the Labour party, yesterday signalled its intention to block any radical
reform of the link between the unions and the party.
Mr Bill Morris, TGWU general secretary, said his union would draft a motion
for this year's Labour conference that would reject most of the reforms
being canvassed, including the idea of giving party membership status to
union members who pay the political levy.
He suggested, however, that his union executive believed there could be
radical reform of the Trades Union Congress. Mr Morris said the TUC should
stop 'reinventing the wheel' by performing functions individual unions could
do for themselves, and should abandon the fiction of influencing the
government with its alternative economic analyses.
Mr Morris refused to say that Mr Norman Willis, TUC general secretary, was
the right man for the job. 'We work with the leader we have,' he said.
The TGWU statement on union-Labour links is the latest sign of opposition to
the radical shake-up in the relationship that was envisaged after the
general election.
All three candidates for the deputy leadership of Labour are now stressing
the importance of retaining the link, and the Nupe public-service union
warned last week that unions would not go funding Labour if they had no
direct influence in the party.
Several unions, including the TGWU and the GMB general union, oppose the
Labour national executive committee's proposal to exclude unions from
selection and reselection of party candidates.
Mr Morris also defended the TGWU against charges that its backing for Mr
John Smith and Mrs Margaret Beckett as Labour leader and deputy leader
respectively was not justified, given the small number of union members who
were consulted.
