FT  23 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Hoskins rebels join battle with directors
next week


   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE


REBEL SHAREHOLDERS in Hoskins Brewery, the Leicester-based real ale brewer,
will join battle with the directors at the company's annual meeting on
October 30.
Mr Richard Cattermole, leader of the dissident group, said yesterday that a
number of board resolutions would be opposed. He claimed to have the support
of shareholders with at least 30 per cent of the votes.
Hoskins reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 83,060 last year, but
extraordinary charges reduced the net gain to Pounds 16,625. In the previous
12 months, there was a loss of Pounds 167,553 after an extraordinary charge
of Pounds 238,267.
Mr Cattermole's main targets are Mr Barrie Hoar, chairman, and his brother,
Mr Robert Hoar. Resolutions to remove them from the board have been tabled
for an extraordinary meeting on November 18.
Mr Cattermole said yesterday that he had no intention of trying to reverse
his company, Ryan Elizabeth - which has 52 licensed outlets and five hotels
 -into Hoskins.
Replying to criticisms that he had no experience as a director of a quoted
company, he said: 'Ryan Elizabeth made net profits of Pounds 294,000 last
year, and Pounds 308,000 the previous year. We have to abide by rules that
are not all that different from those for running a public company.'
