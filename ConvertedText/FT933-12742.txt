FT  22 JUL 93 / International Company News: Anglovaal lifted by rise in gold
price

ANGLOVAAL, the South African gold mine group, increased taxed profits by 84
per cent to R71.2m (Dollars 21.4m) in the June quarter, against the
preceding three months.
Most of the turnround was attributable to Hartebeestfontein, the group's
flagship mine, which raised taxed profits to R56.1m from R36.4m.
The improved profits were mainly due to a 15 per cent increase in the
average gold price received for the mine's underground operations.
The turnround at Loraine, a marginal mine threatened with closure, was also
an important contributor. The mine made a R9.4m profit in the quarter after
a R2m loss for the previous quarter. The results show, for the first time,
the benefits of a seven-day working week - an exemption from the government
 -for a full quarter. This led to a 30 per cent increase in gold production.
Eastern Transvaal, the other large mine in the group, lifted taxed profits
to R5.4m from R4.2m.
