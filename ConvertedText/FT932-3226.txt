FT  15 JUN 93 / International Company News: Bombardier aircraft plan


   By ROBERT GIBBENS


BOMBARDIER, the aerospace and transit equipment group, is moving towards
production of the Dash-8-400, a 70-seater turboprop regional airliner.
Its de Havilland unit in Toronto, acquired in 1992 from Boeing, has invested
CDollars 15m (USDollars 11.8m) in the Series 400 programme up until now.
Bombardier says wing-design refinements and other technological improvements
fit the aircraft closely to emerging market needs.
