FT  14 APR 94 / Motor camps try to forge friendship


   By KEVIN DONE and GILLIAN TETT


European carmakers and automotive components suppliers have launched a joint
initiative aimed at improving their often hostile relationship.
The move follows a recent report sponsored by the Department of Trade and
Industry and the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders which criticised
the motor industry's lack of progress in improving co-operation between the
two groups.
The report said the 'necessary levels of trust' were not present between
vehicle makers and components suppliers.
The two European trade associations representing the carmakers and the
components suppliers have now agreed guidelines for encouraging improved
co-operation.
The action is aimed at raising the competitiveness of the European motor
industry, as it seeks to restructure to meet the fierce challenge from rival
vehicle makers and suppliers in the US and in Japan.
The protocol signed by both sides of the industry is aimed at providing a
'framework for co-operation'.
The protocol seeks to create greater transparency in negotiations over costs
and prices, to improve co-operation in design and manufacturing, to promote
modern manufacturing processes and to raise quality.
Improving relations between the two sides of the motor indutry is seen as
crucial to raising the sector's international competitiveness, but the
rhetoric has seldom been matched in practice.
'The mistrust which is in evidence is the result of many years of broken
promises, abuse of confidence, and general acrimony in the industry,' said
the report by Professor Richard Lamming, of Bath University School of
Management.
