FT  03 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Yorkshire Food incurs seasonal loss of
Pounds 376,000 but confident on full year


   By DAVID BLACKWELL


YORKSHIRE FOOD Group, the Bradford-based food processor floated in March,
yesterday announced first-half pre-tax losses of Pounds 376,000 on sales of
Pounds 29.5m.
However, Mr Mike Firth, chairman, chief executive and founder, pointed to
the highly seasonal nature of the business, which is concentrated in the
dried fruit and nut sector. Last year only 35 per cent of sales were made in
the first half, with the bulk coming in the run up to Christmas.
'Losses in our business are quite typical in the first half,' he said. 'We
are confident about our position for the full year.'
No profits forecast was made at the time of flotation, but Panmure Gordon,
which sponsored the placing, is forecasting full year profits of Pounds
5.3m.
The group, which this month completed the acquisition of 80 per cent of the
dried fruit business of Del Monte, is also planning to dispose of its UK
bakery division, which incurred losses before interest of Pounds 324,000 on
turnover of Pounds 848,000.
The latest deficit followed a loss of Pounds 615,000 on sales of Pounds
22.5m in the 1992 first half. For the full year pre-tax profits were Pounds
2.72m on sales of Pounds 63.2m.
Operating profits were Pounds 86,000 for the first half. Mr Firth said this
figure had been distorted by a first half loss from Treehouse Farms, the US
almond producer acquired last year, which achieves 70 per cent of its sales
in the second half.
While turnover of the US ingredients operations was up from Pounds 2.2m to
Pounds 8m, the business dipped from operating profits of Pounds 17,000 to
losses of Pounds 88,000.
In the UK, the dried fruit and nuts sector increased operating profits from
continuing operations from Pounds 423,000 to Pounds 505,000.
The small beverages division, which roasts, grinds and distributes coffee,
made an operating loss of Pounds 7,000, compared with a Pounds 54,000
profit, reflecting investment in a new factory, warehouse and computer
system.
This increased overheads by about Pounds 300,000, but benefits would be
reflected in the second half, the group said.
Losses per share were 2.19p. An interim dividend of 0.72p is declared.
