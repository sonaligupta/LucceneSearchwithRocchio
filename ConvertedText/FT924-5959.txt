FT  24 NOV 92 / Observer: Open Dorrell


Who says Her Majesty's government has run out of ideas? Treasury minister
Stephen Dorrell, one of the Tories' brighter young things, is begging for
inspiration.
'I want to issue a clear and open invitation for ideas on how we can best go
forward, from financiers, builders, and anybody else with a worth-
while scheme to offer,' the 40-year old minister said in a speech on
privatisation to the Centre for Policy Studies.
This may be just another sign of the Treasury's recent abrupt U-turn on
listening to outsiders. Certainly it ought to help deflect the blame the
next time a Treasury idea goes horribly wrong. No doubt ministers would also
welcome worthwhile advice on how to make a success of the EC presidency, how
to bring about some green economic shoots, how to make the council tax
popular in the south-east etc.
Ideas on a postcard please to S J Dorrell, c/o of HM Treasury, Parliament
Street, London SW1P 3AG.
