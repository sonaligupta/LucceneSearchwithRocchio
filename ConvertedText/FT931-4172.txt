FT  12 MAR 93 / World Trade News: EC credit transfer delayed


   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor


THERE is growing impatience among officials that controversial European
Commission proposals to transfer short-term export credit activities from
government agencies to private hands are still bogged down after four months
of wrangling over which directorate should handle the issue.
After discussions between Mr Karel Van Miert, the new commissioner for
competition policy, and his predecessor, Sir Leon Brittan, now external
relations commissioner, it seems officials would prefer the competition
directorate (DG4) to take up the running.
But Mr Van Miert said yesterday that pressures to deal with issues like
steel and coal had prevented him from 'dealing with the dossier'.
Plans to put short-term export credit insurance for marketable risks into
the hands of private insurers were begun by the external affairs directorate
(DG1) at the beginning of 1992. They arose following a two-year study on
harmonising national export credit policies before creation of the single
market.
Challenging deep-rooted national vested interests dedicated to ensuring
maximum government support for exporters, they were likely to result in
higher insurance premiums, and aroused reinsurance worries for insurers.
Matters became muddled in the middle of last year, when Sir Leon concluded
that the activities of government agencies in providing commercial credit
risk insurance left private sector competitors at an unfair disadvantage. As
such, export credits were a matter for DG4 not DG1.
Officials in DG4 calculated that EC members spend Ecu3.24bn (Pounds 2.7bn) a
year supporting their exporters.
