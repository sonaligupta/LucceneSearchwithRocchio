FT  25 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Lionheart bucks trend with advance to
Pounds 1.1m


DESPITE THE impact of recession on the home improvements and DIY sectors and
discounting by multiple retailers, Lionheart raised pre-tax profits from
Pounds 768,000 to Pounds 1.1m for the six months to June 30.
'Our three main businesses of home improvements and DIY, housewares and
retail systems have all been profitable in the first half,' said Mr Paul
Lever, executive chairman.
'Provided the normal seasonal up-turn in trade materialises from September
through to November, I expect a continuing improvement during the rest of
1992.'
Following a return to the dividend list in April after a three year absence
for reconstruction, there will be an interim of 0.2p.
Sales were ahead at Pounds 21.5m (Pounds 11m), against Pounds 32.3m for the
last full year.
The re-organisation of the housewares division is now nearly complete,
following the purchase of Croydex, the bathroom and household products
company, from Hanson for Pounds 7.7m a year ago.
Earnings per share came out at 0.48p (0.57p).
