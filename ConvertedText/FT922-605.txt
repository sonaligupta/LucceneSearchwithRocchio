FT  26 JUN 92 / World Trade News: East European steel warning


   By ANDREW BAXTER


WESTERN governments should act to stimulate domestic demand for steel in
eastern Europe, relieving the pressure on local steelmakers to export at low
prices, according to a report by Meps (Europe), the steel consultancy.
East European governments, meanwhile, should press on quickly with
rationalisation, paving the way for generous privatisation terms to
encourage foreign investment in steel. The recommendations are made in East
European Steel, a 540-page report which analyses the problems of the steel
industries in Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania, the former Yugoslavia and
the former Soviet Union.
The collapse of the former Soviet Union and political upheaval in eastern
Europe have seriously damaged these countries' traditional markets. East
European producers have tried to switch to exporting to western Europe,
provoking complaints from some western steelmakers about dumping.
The Meps report stresses that inward investment by the west, encouraged by
western governments, is essential to stimulate domestic demand for steel in
eastern Europe, thus defusing the row over imports to the west.
However, it warns of a potential obstacle to privatisation projects caused
by the imports issue.
Many east European privatisations in consumer goods have successfully used
low labour costs to produce finished products for domestic consumption and
more importantly, export to western markets, it says. But the strategy would
not be readily acceptable to the west in the steel sector.
