FT  04 AUG 92 / Limited liability for one


   By ANDREW JACK


COMPANIES can now be created with a single shareholder, under legislation
published yesterday in response to the European Community twelfth company
law directive.
The Companies (Single Member Private Limited Companies) Regulation amends
the 1985 Companies Act, which previously required at least two people to
create a company with limited liability.
It also protects existing companies that become single-member companies,
after events such as the transfer of shares, from insolvency or the loss of
limited-liability privilege.
The Department of Trade and Industry said yesterday that the legislation
represented a simplification of red tape in company formation, in accordance
with the EC directive introduced in 1989.
The DTI denied that the move was likely to lead to the creation of more
fraudulent companies. It said that was no more likely than under existing
legislation with just two shareholders, one of whom could be a nominee and
therefore offer little more protection.
The regulation for single-member companies provides safeguards by requiring
that contracts, corporate decisions and other information are put in writing
and specifies criminal penalties for any breaches.
The Inland Revenue has tightened regulations over profit-related pay schemes
that it will accept for registration.
A new statement of practice says any schemes that give a formula for the
distribution of profits without specifying the figures used will no longer
be accepted.
PROPOSED Treasury guidelines on money laundering are burdensome and omit
certain important groups, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England
and Wales said yesterday, Andrew Jack writes.
The institute emphasises that secondary legislation on laundering should be
extended to the unregulated financial sector, to include businesses such as
Bureaux de Change.
