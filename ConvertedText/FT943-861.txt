Northern Leisure, the discotheque, ten-pin bowling and amusement park
concern, announced pre-tax profits sharply up from Pounds 663,000 to Pounds
2.54m in the year to August 31 1994.
Turnover slipped to Pounds 22.7m (Pounds 23.2m). It included Pounds 980,000
(Pounds 2.23m) from discontinued operations.
Trading since May, when the company underwent a refinancing, had been 'very
satisfactory', the directors said. Accordingly, the company is resuming
dividend payments with a proposed 2p final, the first payment since 1990.
It hopes to pay an interim next year of not less than 1p. Earnings per share
were 7.7p (2.3p).
