FT  22 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Ivory & Sime rises to Pounds 2.27m


   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor


IVORY & SIME, the fund management group, has announced an 8.5 per cent rise,
from Pounds 2.09m to Pounds 2.27m, in pre-tax profits for the six months to
October 31.
The Edinburgh-based group is increasing its interim dividend by 40 per cent,
from 1.25p to 1.75p, as part of a strategy of reducing the disparity with
the final. The board said the final would be not less than last year's 4.5p.
Funds under management were stable at Pounds 2.95bn, with the effect of
rising stock markets offsetting the loss of some client funds, such as the
Ensign Trust contract. About half of that total was in investment trusts,
and a quarter in pension funds.
In November Ivory & Sime acquired a direct marketing company called McColl
McGregor, which will help develop its investment trust business.
Mr David Newbigging, chairman, said that earnings per share, up 19 per cent
from 4.15p to 4.94p, had benefited 'from continued attention to cost control
and tighter management of working capital.' Administrative expenses fell
from Pounds 5.14m to Pounds 4.8m, while interest and investment income rose
from Pounds 437,000 to Pounds 581,000. The company also bought 2.25m of its
own shares, for cancellation, during the period.
