FT  09 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Akzo plans operational
shake-up


   By REUTER


   ARNHEM


AKZO, the Dutch chemicals group, is reorganising its operations. It plans to
remove a layer of management, which employs some 1,000 people, and sell off
its most persistent loss-making activities, Reuter reports from Arnhem.
Akzo's worst loss-makers accounted for 15 per cent of sales in 1990, but it
began selling them off last year.
The company plans to merge two of its basic divisions; general chemicals and
salt and basic chemicals. The general chemicals division employs about 8,100
people with a further 6,500 employed in the salt and basics division. The
group had a total workforce of 64,500 people in September.
The merger will begin in February and be completed by May 1993. However, the
company said no areas of activity would be eliminated purely because of the
divisional merger and it could give no figures about job losses.
However, Mr Aarnout Loudon, Akzo's chairman, said the changes in the
management structure would inevitably result in job losses.
Mr Loudon, who announced the reorganisation and divestment plans in his New
Year message, said that the next 40 per cent of sales which produced only 25
per cent of operating income, would be either strengthened, divested, or put
in co-operation ventures.
No timescale was given.
Akzo is due to report its 1991 results next month. In 1990, it made net
profits of Fl 727m. Mr Loudon said 1991 profits looked to be modestly lower.
