FT  25 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Barr & Wallace at Pounds 4.3m


AMID difficult trading conditions, Barr & Wallace Arnold, the motor and fuel
distributor and leisure group, maintained second half profits at Pounds 3.2m
to finish 1991 some 4.5 per cent lower at Pounds 4.31m, against Pounds
4.51m.
Mr Malcolm Barr, chairman, described the result as satisfactory, given the
effects of the recession on the motor division, which comprises about half
the group.
Motor profits on continuing businesses fell 20 per cent to Pounds 1.99m
(Pounds 2.49m), but new car sales dropped by only 12.6 per cent against a
national average of 20.7 per cent. Leisure and holidays achieved a slightly
better Pounds 3.7m (Pounds 3.63m) reflecting strong demand for inclusive UK
holidays which offset the Gulf war effect. Fuel distribution fell to Pounds
309,000 (Pounds 480,000).
Turnover dropped from Pounds 238.3m to Pounds 229.5m. Earnings per share
slipped to 20.7p (22.8p), but the dividend for the year is raised to 10p
(9.75p) with a recommended final of 7p.
Borrowings were reduced from Pounds 14.8m to Pounds 9.1m and quality of
earnings improved by disposing of four loss-making businesses. Gearing was
cut to 32.4 per cent (55.3 per cent).
