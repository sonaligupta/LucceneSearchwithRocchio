FT  30 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Henderson TR is top of the Peps


   By PHILIP COGGAN


HENDERSON Touche Remnant, the merged fund management group, dominates the
top 10 performing investment trust Peps over the last three years. The list,
produced by Chase de Vere, contains five Henderson TR trusts.
The best performer, Personal Assets, which is a self-managed trust (with
links to Ivory & Sime), has an investment portfolio split between the UK and
the US. Manager Ian Rushbrook says he has felt the UK market has been
undervalued for some time and has accordingly done well out of investing in
the shares of fund management companies, which represent a geared play on
the market.
Among the unit trust, the top place over three years is held by the St
James's Place Pep Progressive fund. Its sister trust, International Growth,
was covered in our Unit Trusts series recently; the management team, led by
Nils Taube, follows a stock-picking approach, linked to various investment
themes. Performance tables, covering some 550 unit and investment trust
plans, are available with Chase's Pepguide for Pounds 9.95 from: Chase de
Vere Investments, 63 Lincoln's Inn Fields, London WC2A 3JX.
