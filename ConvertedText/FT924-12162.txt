FT  22 OCT 92 / RAF cuts search and rescue


ROYAL Air Force helicopters are to end search and rescue operations at four
UK bases under cuts announced yesterday.
The reorganisation of search and rescue activities - the most popular aspect
of the RAF's presence in coastal and mountain areas of Britain - comes after
a year-long review. The Ministry of Defence opted against hiving off rescue
responsibilities to the private sector.
The bases affected are at Leuchars, Fyfe, Brawdy in Dyfed, Manston in Kent
and Coltishall in Norfolk. No redundancies were announced, but the future of
the Manston facility is in question.
