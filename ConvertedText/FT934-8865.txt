FT  13 NOV 93 / German deficit nears DM235bn record

GERMANY'S budget deficit will this year reach a record DM235bn (Pounds
95bn), or 7.2 per cent of gross national product, according to figures
published in Bonn yesterday.
In spite of a last minute demand by parliamentarians for a further DM5bn cut
in central government spending next year, the 1994 deficit will still reach
more than DM220bn, or 6.8 per cent of GNP, and may well be much higher,
according to the calculations.
The calculations include the deficits of the federal government as well as
the 16 states, local authorities, and a string of public sector funds and
bodies such as the Treuhand privatisation agency, German railways and the
mail services.
Mr Rudi Walther, chairman of the parliamentary budget committee, and a
member of the opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD), published the
figures yesterday, accusing the ruling coalition of being 'financially and
morally at an end.' He said the budget was sinking 'into a chaos of debt'.
He was presenting the results of the budget negotiations for next year,
concluded late on Thursday night, in which the federal government deficit
will be kept below DM70bn, only thanks to the imposition of an
across-the-board DM5bn 'global reduction' agreed by members of the coalition
at the last minute.
Hopes to keep the federal deficit to only DM68bn were dashed by the latest
estimates of tax revenues next year, published earlier in the week, which
suggest a DM2.7bn shortfall below the original estimate on which the draft
1994 budget was based.
In addition, the federal labour office is expected to run a further huge
deficit next year, as unemployment continues to rise.
Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, now has to find ways of saving the
extra DM5bn, on top of the painfully-negotiated DM21bn savings package
already pushed through.
Mr Walther's figures suggest that the overall public sector debt will reach
DM1,923bn in the current year, or 61.6 per cent of GNP, rising to DM2,169bn
next year (66.8 per cent of estimated GNP), DM2,317bn in 1995 (67.4 per cent
of estimated GNP), and only dropping to 65.4 per cent of GNP by 1997.
All those figures suggest that public sector debt in Germany, when including
the debts of all public authorities like the Treuhand, the post and the
railways, will remain well above the 60 per cent of GNP limit proposed for
European economic and monetary union.
