FT  15 DEC 94 / Economic Viewpoint: Time to know what you pay for


   By SAMUEL BRITTAN


The British government's defeat over VAT on domestic energy is of more than
just temporary political interest. For it brings to the surface how very
muddled the public is on the whole subject of spending and taxes. Opinion
poll after opinion poll shows that voters seem to want more publicly
provided, or financed, services. Yet they rear up against any attempts to
pay for these services by spreading the tax net more widely.
An idea of the public mood emerges from one poll in which nearly 50 per cent
replied that taxes on high incomes were too low, or 'much too low'. Only 6
per cent thought that taxes on middle incomes were too low and hardly anyone
thought that of taxes on low incomes. Yet the overwhelming majority of those
polled regarded themselves as either middle or low income. Less than 3 per
cent regarded themselves as receiving high incomes. On this evidence, there
are just too few rich to soak.
But the real drawbacks of allocating resources through competitive elections
rather than competitive markets go beyond these contradictions. They can be
summed up in the jargon phrase 'full line supply'. When a buyer makes
purchases in a supermarket, he or she can decide on how much he or she
wishes to spend and on what items. But when it comes to public goods like
defence, every citizen has to have the same amount. Worse than that: the
voter has to decide between two or three bundles of vague policies covering
all issues, none of which may express his or her preferences, but which he
or she has to take or leave as a whole.
Despite the drawbacks, some services are better financed collectively than
by relying on the private marketplace alone. One way of introducing a little
more coherence might be by some form of hypothecated or earmarked taxes,
designated for specific public services. There can, but need not, be a close
connection between the nature of the tax and the service for which it pays.
A historical example of an earmarked tax was 'Ship Money', levied on English
seaports and coastal regions to finance the Royal Navy. When Charles I
revived the tax in 1634-38, he started a chain of events which contributed
to the English civil war, his own beheading and a period of republican
government. But that was because the levies were extended to inland regions
and Parliament was not consulted. Earmarked taxes that are carefully and
sensitively applied may still be a lesser evil than today's habit of putting
all official revenues into a pool to be allocated at the government's
discretion.
Earmarked taxes have begun to receive support from different parts of the
political spectrum, for instance the UK left-of-centre think-tank, Demos,
and the free-market Institute for Economic Affairs. Hypothecated taxes are
already frequent in the US, where they are said to finance about half of
local spending. Many of the uses which Demos envisages for earmarking are
primarily local: for example, expenditure on the London Underground, city
nursery places, or a town's bid for the Olympics. For such applications to
work effectively in the UK, councils would have to acquire sources of
revenue sufficient to finance their own budgets.
Meanwhile, there is quite a lot than can be done at a national level.
Earmarked taxes cannot remove all the defects of state provision. They
cannot enable different voters to have different military budgets or
different sized health services to suit their individual preferences. But
they can at least make sure that the services come with a price tag and that
expenditure is representative of what the middle of the road taxpayer is
prepared to finance.
An example is public expenditure on health. This was running in the UK in
1993-94 (the last year for which a functional breakdown of public spending
was available) at almost Pounds 44bn - slightly more than the yield of VAT.
Why not then earmark the proceeds of VAT for the National Health Service and
let voters put their money where their mouths are? If they desire ever more
NHS expenditure, they should be ready to see the VAT rate creep up from 17
1/2 to 18, 19, 20 per cent and however much more it takes. Eventually even
the belligerent uniformed nurses who turn up at every televised election
brains trust with their demands for 'more, more, more' will begin to be
heard more critically.
Finance ministries have opposed hypothecated taxation mainly because it
reduces their own power. They can however call in aid well-known abuses of
hypothecation. There have been raids on supposedly hypothecated revenues.
The UK Road Fund used to be diverted to finance expenditure of no benefit to
motorists. The opposite distortion arises when general revenues are diverted
to top up hypothecated taxes. Until 1989 UK National Insurance contributions
were supplemented by an Exchequer contribution.
Another danger is tokenism, such as the extra 1p on the income tax which the
Liberal Democrats wanted to spend on education in the 1992 election. Without
having to bear a known tax for existing educational expenditure, voters are
not in a good position to judge whether they want to spend more or less.
The greatest obstacle to successful earmarking is inadequate public
knowledge. In most countries half or more of social security taxes are
levied on employers. Employees still have to pay in the end, as these taxes
are passed back in lower wages or passed forward in higher prices. As a
result, contributions cannot be used to put a price tag on increases in
social expenditure, such as pensions or sickness benefit.
Earmarking is indeed easier for indirect taxes on goods and services. But
some progress is still possible on the direct side. Income tax plus employee
national insurance contributions amounted in the UK in 1993-94 to nearly
Pounds 80bn. This was slightly less than the bill for social security. Why
not then earmark the whole of these personal tax receipts for a
Redistribution Fund from which all benefits, whether contributory or not,
would be paid? Gradually the gross totals of both tax and benefits could be
reduced as Inland Revenue computerisation allowed some optional netting off
in household taxes and benefits; and an approach could be made to a negative
income tax.
A study of earmarking by Margaret Wilkinson in the November issue of Fiscal
Studies* concludes that the snags are so great that earmarking is, except on
a very small scale, a snare and a delusion. She ends: 'Governments must
weigh the alternatives, and determine priorities with full knowledge of the
complexities that are involved, and then be accountable to the electorate
for them.' But it is precisely this unrealistic demand for omniscience by
governments which convinces some of us that there must be a better way.
