FT  30 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading


   By JOEL KIBAZO


FURTHER profit taking in stock index futures brought a decline which saw the
September contract on the FT-SE test the 2,900 resistance level, writes Joel
Kibazo.
The September contract opened at 2,920 taking its cue from the strong
overnight performance on Wall Street. But this positive start made little
lasting impression and having risen to the 2,926 within the first hour, it
went into retreat.
Most of the selling was led by independent traders and had the effect of
pulling the underlying cash market lower as it gathered pace. Sentiment was
also dampened by a poor gilts sector, a rights issue from United Newspapers,
and a sell programme from Smith New Court.
Having traded between 2,910 and 2,905 for most of the session, a big seller
saw September fall to the day's low of 2,901 in the last hour of trading.
However, bargain hunting just ahead of the close brought a modest rally and
the contract finished at 2,904, down 15 on its previous close but 6 points
ahead of its fair value premium to cash of 11 points. Volume improved to
7,368 lots.
The traded options was more lively and recorded improved turnover of 27,066,
against 21,964 contracts the previous day. The FT-SE 100 option saw business
of 8,815 contracts, while 3,875 lots was recorded in the Euro FT-SE 100
option. Grand Metropolitan was the most active stock option with a day's
total of 1,777 lots.
