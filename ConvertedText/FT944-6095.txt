FT  30 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Cash call worries hit T&N


   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN


News of a jump in the cost of asbestos-related claims at motor parts group
T&N pushed the stock market's rights issue fears back to the very top of the
agenda and sent the shares tumbling in heavy 7.1m turnover. They closed 35
lower at 186p, a drop of 15 per cent.
It also led analysts to downgrade profits forecasts. NatWest Securities
sliced back its T&N estimate for 1994 from Pounds 112.5m pre-tax to Pounds
108.5m and said the claims experience put a clear question mark against the
group's earnings and dividend prospects for some years to come.
The rise in claim provisions was totally unforeseen and it led to a clear
deepening of the market's rights issue concern. This surfaced init-ially in
September when T&N took an option to buy 52 per cent of German pistons group
Kolbenschmidt.
The worry for the market is that if taken up the option would cost some
Pounds 118m, while an outright bid for Kolbenschmidt, including debt, could
involve outlays of more than Pounds 350m - 35 per cent of T&N's market
capitalisation.
