FT  02 JUL 92 / Slack still growing in companies


   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY


THE number of companies operating at less than full capacity is increasing
and export orders are shortening, according the latest quarterly survey of
Bradford Chamber of Commerce, Ian Hamilton Fazey writes.
The chamber says fortunes have been mixed and there is no firm evidence that
the recession may be ending.
The survey, of one in eight businesses, shows improving balance figures  -
the difference between the proportion reporting improvements and declines -
in home and export orders and in deliveries.
There was a weakening in the proportion of businesses reporting growing
export orders - from 32 per cent to 29 per cent - and the chamber says that
is cause for concern. Only 23 per cent of the 217 respondents are at full
capacity, a deterioration of 3 percentage points on the quarter.
Interest rates remained the most important factor in need of improvement.
