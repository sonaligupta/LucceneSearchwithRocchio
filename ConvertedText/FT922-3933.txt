FT  09 JUN 92 / People: Being number one


Hays, the business services group, has picked David Tibble, head of
financial control at BTR, as its new finance director, with Graham Williams
promoted into the new position of corporate development director.
Tibble, 40, was a contender for the job of finance director at BTR himself,
but the company went outside to pick Kathleen O'Donovan, the 35-year-old
former Ernst & Young partner who has so impressed the City since she was
appointed last year.
Hays chairman Ronnie Frost said yesterday that 'after a six month search I
am delighted to have found someone who thinks it worthwhile to move to a
smaller company to be number one.' The experience in the financial work of a
bigger company, and one that has 'attacked and acquired aggressively' is
what Frost says he was looking for.
Frost has repositioned 49-year-old Williams, who was himself keen to move
from pure finance onto the commercial side of the business, in preparation
for an ambitious programme of acquisitions domestically and abroad. Frost
aims to double the company's size in the next three years. 'Graham speaks
perfect French and negotiable German' says Frost, adding that he will
continue 'to be supportive with the City' until Tibble's feet have been
under the desk for a while.
