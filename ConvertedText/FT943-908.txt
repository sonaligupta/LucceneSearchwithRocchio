FT  27 SEP 94 / Observer: Token tip


How nice of Hodder Headline to cut the price of its hardbacks by pulling out
of the net book agreement. What a pity the price-slashing will happen from
Boxing Day - ie, well after the biggest annual spend on books. Observer's
tip: give everyone book tokens this Christmas.
And what was the book Tim Hely Hutchinson, Hodder Headline's chief
executive, chose to help publicise his decision to withdraw from the
price-rigging? Lilley & Chase, a novel set against the background of
publishing, by Tim Waterstone, founder of the Waterstone bookshop chain  -
and a noted supporter of the net book agreement. And who illustrated the
jacket cover? T'other Tim's brother - Nicholas Hely Hutchinson. Incestuous
business, the book trade.
