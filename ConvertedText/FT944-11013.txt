FT  08 NOV 94 / International Company News: Heavy loss in US pushes
Trygg-Hansa into the red - Swedish insurer posts SKr813m deficit at nine
months

Trygg-Hansa, the Swedish insurer, plunged to an operating loss of SKr813m
(Dollars 110m) in the first nine months of the year from a SKr1.1bn
operating profit in the same period last year. It was hit by heavy losses
incurred by Home Holdings, the US insurer in which Trygg holds a 35.3 per
cent stake.
A fall in premiums to SKr5.37bn from SKr5.95bn, mainly due to Trygg's
withdrawal from reinsurance, and a rise in claims led to a loss of SKr125m
in the group's core property and casualty insurance business, compared with
a profit last time of SKr565m.
Trygg incurred a gross loss of SKr520m due to the sinking of the Baltic
ferry Estonia, which sank with the loss of 900 lives in September, but after
reinsurance the net loss was limited to SKr62m.
The operating result was dragged into the red by Trygg's SKr646m share in
Home's operating losses, and a SKr735m share in losses on Home's bond
portfolio.
Trygg said Home planned to strengthen its capital base by Dollars 250m by
debt and/or equity issues. In addition, Trygg would convert loans to Home of
Dollars 170m entirely or in part to shareholder's equity.
Trygg's so-called total result, which includes the full impact of the
group's investment performance, also tumbled to a loss of SKr1.76bn from a
profit of SKr2.03bn due to unrealised losses in the group's bond portfolio.
Den norske Bank, Norway's largest commercial bank, announced that DnB
Forsikring, the group's new insurance unit will be established with capital
of NKr300m (Dollars 45m), writes Karen Fossli in Oslo.
DnB yesterday submitted an application to the finance ministry for a
concession for the unit, which is scheduled to begin operations during the
second half of next year.
