FT  24 MAR 92 / International Company News: Banc One spends Dollars 782m on
buying Texas bank


   By MARTIN DICKSON


   NEW YORK


BANC ONE, the rapidly-growing US regional banking group, is expanding its
presence in Texas with the Dollars 782m purchase of Team Bancshares, the
sixth largest bank in the state.
The move is the latest in a series of mergers among regional banking groups
which is slowly consolidating the extremely fragmented US banking system.
Banc One, based in Ohio, is one of the most highly regarded banking groups
in the US, with a strong balance sheet, consistently good earnings and
record of successfully integrating acquisitions across the midwest and
Texas.
It first expanded into Texas in 1989 through the purchase of the troubled
MCorp banking group from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the
government agency which oversees failed banks, and has since added to its
network by buying several failed thrifts.
Its local subsidiary, Banc One, Texas, is the third largest bank in the
state, ranked by assets. It said the Team acquisition will move it into
second place, with roughly 200 branches and Dollars 19bn in assets, behind
NCNB and ahead of First Interstate.
Team, based in Dallas, has assets of some Dollars 5.5bn and concentrates on
retail and middle-market lending - areas which Banc One also favours.
The deal will give Banc One the largest presence, in terms of branches, in
the Dallas/Forth Worth area and around the state capital of Austin.
The merger involves Banc One offering Dollars 82 of its stock for each share
in Team. The two sides expect to complete the deal during the fourth quarter
of this year.
Banc One has largely avoided the loan loss problems which have afflicted
many leading US banks over the past two years.
It shunned very large corporate credits and highly-leveraged transactions,
which have caused large headaches elsewhere, while the property markets in
its areas of operation have been relatively buoyant.
