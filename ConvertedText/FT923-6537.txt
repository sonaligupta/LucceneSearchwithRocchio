FT  24 AUG 92 / Labour counters criticism on Bosnia


   By IVO DAWNAY


MR JACK CUNNINGHAM, the shadow foreign secretary, yesterday firmly countered
an attack from Labour leftwingers that the leadership has been 'clueless'
and slow in pressing international issues, Ivo Dawnay writes.
He described a highly critical editorial in the latest issue of Tribune
newspaper and an accompanying article by Ms Clare Short, a fellow
frontbencher, on the party's response to the Bosnian crisis as 'ill-informed
and wrong'.
He said Labour's foreign affairs team had repeatedly castigated the
government's slow response to the Balkan conflict, alongside its
parsimonious attitude to aid and its misguided approach to exiles and asylum
seekers.
Mr Cunningham insisted that the party leadership would discuss this week
whether Labour should demand a recall of parliament to discuss the former
Yugoslavia and Iraq. He added that on the Bosnian question the issues were
difficult and complex, while the most important objective was to end
hostilities.
