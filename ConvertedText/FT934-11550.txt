FT  30 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Societies retain their urge to merge


   By ALISON SMITH


THE abandonment of the planned merger between the Leeds Permanent and
National & Provincial building societies will not necessarily affect the 1m
people who borrow from or have an account with them, writes Alison Smith.
Although the cancellation is slightly embarrassing, neither society needed
to be rescued; thus, neither is left in severe difficulty.
The merger, combining the Leeds' Pounds 18bn in assets with the N&P's Pounds
12bn, would have created the UK's third-largest society, not far behind the
Nationwide.
Much has been made of the societies' different styles, which stymied the
merger. The Leeds is seen in the industry as being more traditional while
N&P has adopted a more unconventional approach based more on teamwork and
emphasising a focus on the customer rather than on the product.
John Wriglesworth, building societies analyst at UBS, says that although the
two approaches are strikingly different, both have worked for their
respective societies. He said both remain 'very strong' and could prosper
alone.
The Leeds has made clear that it is still looking for a potential partner.
And while David O'Brien, the chief executive of the N&P, talks of its
strategy of 'organic growth,' it also would be ready for discussions if
there were a 'meeting of minds' with another society.
