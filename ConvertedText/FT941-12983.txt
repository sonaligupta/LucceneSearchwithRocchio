FT  27 JAN 94 / International Company News: Big US oil groups overcome price
falls


   By RICHARD WATERS


The three biggest US oil groups - Exxon, Mobil and Chevron - all reported
sharply higher refining and marketing earnings for the last three months of
1993, helping to offset the effects of the precipitous fall in world oil
prices.
Together with significant cost-cutting over the past year, the rise in
profits from downstream activities enabled both Exxon and Mobil to report
higher operating income for the period compared with a year before, while
Chevron profits eased slightly.
At Exxon, upstream exploration and production earnings fell to Dollars 743m,
from Dollars 1bn the year before (before one-off items). This was balanced
by higher downstream profits, which rose to Dollars 625m from Dollars 399m
(before special items). Recurring profits from chemicals rose to Dollars
143m from Dollars 71m on lower costs and a shift towards higher-margin
products.
Net income for the quarter rose to Dollars 1.5bn, or Dollars 1.20 a share,
from Dollars 1.4bn, or Dollars 1.12, the year before. Full-year earnings at
Exxon were also bolstered by Dollars 450m of cost savings, taking net income
to Dollars 5.3bn on sales of Dollars 111bn compared with Dollars 4.8bn for
1992 on sales of Dollars 117bn.
Mobil said its exploration and production earnings fell by Dollars 137m
during the last quarter, to Dollars 337m, while marketing and refining
profits rose by Dollars 150m to Dollars 355m (excluding all special items).
Unlike other groups, Mobil failed to see an upturn in its chemicals
business, which is heavily dependent on polyethylene prices, and reported
operating income of Dollars 1m down from Dollars 4m.
Net income for the quarter was Dollars 349m (Dollars 602m before charges),
compared with Dollars 582m a year earlier. For the year, net income was
Dollars 2.1bn (Dollars 2.3bn before special items and accounting changes)
compared with Dollars 862m (Dollars 1.5bn) for 1992.
At Chevron, net income for the final quarter totalled Dollars 294m (Dollars
515m before special items), compared with Dollars 1.1bn (Dollars 542m before
items) the year before. Exploration and production earnings fell from
Dollars 342m to Dollars 283m, while refining and marketing income climbed
from Dollars 192m to Dollars 236m.
Full-year net income reached Dollars 1.3bn (Dollars 2.1bn before one-off
factors), compared with Dollars 1.6bn (Dollars 1.6bn) in 1992.
