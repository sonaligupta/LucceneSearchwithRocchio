FT  04 MAR 94 / International Company News: Goodman Fielder dips 12% at
interim stage


   By NIKKI TAIT


Goodman Fielder, Australia's largest food group which has been the subject
of recent management turmoil, lacklustre earnings, and shareholder
disgruntlement, reported a 12.1 per cent fall in interim profits, to
ADollars 57.6m (USDollars 41.2m) after tax but before abnormals.
The figure, which compared with ADollars 65.5m a year earlier, was achieved
on sales 7.3 per cent lower at ADollars 1.94bn. Earnings per share, also
after tax but ahead of minorities, slipped by 16.7 per cent to 5 cents.
Profits after tax and abnormals stood at ADollars 61.6m, compared with
ADollars 131.8m in the previous year, when there was a large abnormal
surplus.
The company pointed out yesterday that comparisons were distorted by
disposals and purchases. It said the operating earnings, before interest,
from ongoing operations rose by 16.8 per cent in the first half, although
total operating profit after interest charges of ADollars 42.6m, against
ADollars 47.4m, was flat at ADollars 91.6m.
Performance varied across the group. The Australian milling operations made
a reduced contribution, affected by higher wheat prices, and the Australian
poultry business also had a difficult half-year. Ingredients saw earnings
before interest and tax fall by 21.1 per cent.
However, margins in the European food group improved from 3.5 per cent to
4.7 per cent, and its contribution to operating earnings increased from
ADollars 22.9m to ADollars 27.8m, due partly to the full inclusion of
Wessanen (compared with two months last time).
Yesterday, Mr Barry Weir, chief executive, said that the group was looking
at 'modest earnings growth' in the second half, and that its current focus
was on the underperforming parts of the group.
