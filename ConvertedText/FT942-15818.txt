FT  13 APR 94 / International Company News: Increased advertising revenue
raises Gannett in first term


   By RICHARD TOMKINS


   NEW YORK


Increased advertising revenues helped Gannett, the US media group that
publishes the newspaper USA Today, produce a 19 per cent increase in net
income to Dollars 78.7m in the first quarter.
The company's interests include 83 newspapers, nine television stations and
11 radio stations. It is also the largest outdoor advertising company in the
US.
Turnover was 4 per cent higher than in the same quarter last year at Dollars
876.6m, as economic growth fuelled stronger advertising demand in most parts
of the group.
An increase in costs of just 1 per cent helped lift earnings per share to 54
cents from 46 cents last time. The dividend was increased to 33 cents a
share from 32 cents.
Gannett said an 11 per cent increase in revenues from classified advertising
contributed significantly to newspaper revenue gains, with recruitment
advertising rising each month.
Newspaper advertising revenues increased by 6 per cent overall, helping
produce a 9 per cent gain in newspaper profits to Dollars 142.7m.
At USA Today, which saw its first profitable year in 1993, advertising
revenues were unchanged from the comparable quarter's record level, but paid
advertising pages fell to 931 from 970.
Broadcasting profits, buoyed by Winter Olympics advertising on Gannett's two
CBS-affiliated television stations, jumped to Dollars 21.2m from Dollars 9m.
Earnings were also lifted by the recent sale of four radio stations and the
company's television station in Boston.
Outdoor advertising revenues fell 2 per cent and losses worsened to Dollars
4.7m from Dollars 4.1m.
