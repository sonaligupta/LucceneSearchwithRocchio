FT  11 APR 92 / Finance & The Family: Zeros lead investment trusts


   By PHILIP COGGAN


RECENT investor enthusiasm for split capital investment trusts may seem
justified by tables comparing share price performance.
Over three years, the two best performing shares have been zeros, which have
benefited from positive and negative factors. On the plus side has been the
fall in interest rates, which causes zeros, like bonds, to rise in price. On
the negative side, the poor performance of stock markets in general has led
investors to seek the relative security of zeros. Zeros pay no income but
have first claim on the assets of the trust when it is wound up.
Over seven years, two of the top five performers have been income shares,
which were helped by strong dividend growth (until 1991-92) and by private
investor demand. Income shares usually involve the risk of capital loss as
the trust approaches maturity.
Indeed, the chances are that whatever the market circumstances, some kind of
split trust shares would be top of the listings. Were we to see a sharp bull
market, then capital shares would top the tables.
The problem for the private investor is to divine which class of split trust
shares is set to profit. Buying the wrong class could result in very poor
returns. Capital shares have fallen by an average 20 per cent over the past
three years, for example. But some might believe that this week's
Conservative victory will herald a revival in capital share prices.
Those who prefer to buy trusts with a simple structure have done best to
keep their money overseas. The average UK general trust has fallen by 4.9
per cent over three years, compared with a 25.2 per cent rise for
international general trusts. Over seven years the figures are more evenly
balanced - 119.6 per cent versus 136.7 per cent  - but still favour the
internationalists.
Some geographical specialists have done even better. Wall Street's strength
has meant that American trusts are best over three years (an average 52 per
cent rise) with far east (excluding Japan) trusts proving to be the top
geographical sector over seven years (a 227.1 per cent increase).
Overspecialisation can be risky. Investors in the Korea Europe fund, for
example, have suffered a near 57 per cent decline over the past three years;
the Singapore SESDAQ fund is 42 per cent down since April 1989. Many of the
European single country funds have fallen by 25 per cent or more over the
last two years
The international general trusts have the benefits of greater stability. The
sector average shows positive returns over one, two, three, five and seven
years. Experts tend to agree that such trusts are the first port of call for
the private investor.
Top international trust over seven years, with a rise of 211.5 per cent, was
Law Debenture, with Bankers second and Foreign & Colonial third.
