FT  22 DEC 92 / Honecker to stay in jail


   By REUTER


   BERLIN


Former East German leader Erich Honecker was ordered by a court yesterday to
remain in jail on manslaughter charges linked to the border shooting of
would-be defectors, Reuter reports from Berlin. A Berlin court rejected a
motion by Mr Honecker's lawyers to have the case dropped on the grounds that
the 80-year-old communist was too ill with liver cancer to survive a trial.
