FT  12 MAR 93 / Observer: Paper trail


To make matters even worse, the accident-prone stock exhange's brochures
cheerily explaining the functionings of Taurus were still landing on
shareholders' doormats on the eve of the system's demise.
Any recipient who got to the leaflet's page 6 before big boss Peter Rawlins
fell on his sword, would have been rewarded with some prescient words of
reassurance. 'In the unlikely event of something going wrong . . .' begins a
sentence which sadly fails to finish before something . . . er . . . goes
wrong. A repeated line of text - something that can happen to the best of
us, that can happen to the best of us.
