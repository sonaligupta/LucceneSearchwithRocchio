FT  28 APR 94 / Arts: The Proms plan a nostalgic centenary season


   By ANTONY THORNCROFT


The 100th season of the BBC Proms opens on July 15 and yesterday director
John Drummond announced a programme wallowing in nostalgia and fascinating
oddities. This is not a time for ambitious new works (they will come in
1995, for which pieces have been commissioned from 18 composers including
Berio, Birtwistle, Elliott Carter, Steve Reich, Maxwell Davies, and Henze):
the only major premiere is John Tavener's 'The Apocalypse' on August 14, an
ambitious two hour work.
Instead the heroes and heroines of Proms Past are honoured. Among the more
interesting concerts is the re-creation, on July 16, of a typical Prom of
the turn of the century: the programme of September 6 1900, consisting of 17
works including patriotic Boer War songs such as 'When the Boys come Home'.
Eight concerts pay tribute to Proms personalities, including the founder Sir
Henry Wood; Basil Cameron; Constant Lambert; Malcolm Sargent and more. There
will also be 68 performances of works which received their British premieres
at the Proms, an extraordinary list including Mahler symphonies;
Tchaikovsky's First Symphony; Sibelius' 'Karelia Suite'; and Rakhmaninov's
Piano Concerto No 1.
Old traditions have been revived, such as a Wagner night; a Viennese night;
and the Beethoven symphonies played in chronological order. Heather Harper
comes out of retirement to sing on July 19; Ida Haendel, who made her Prom
debut in 1937, plays Britten's violin concerto on July 18 in front of the
Queen, who is making her first appearance at a Prom; and on July 22 Bernard
Haitink recreates the programme which marked his Proms debut in 1966.
As well as the biggest music festival in the world the Proms is the most
successful, with 83 per cent audience capacity last year. Yesterday John
Drummond paraded the amazing statistics: 42,000 works performed in 5,400
concerts over the century, with Wagner receiving almost 4,500 performances,
2,000 more than Beethoven. Sir Henry Wood conducted on almost 27,500
occasions, a long way ahead of Sir Malcolm Sargent with 2,400 Proms. And
Wagner's overture to 'Tannhauser' is the most performed work: it has been
played 280 times.
