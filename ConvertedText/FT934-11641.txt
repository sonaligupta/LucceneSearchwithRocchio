FT  30 OCT 93 / Customs traces Pounds 1.96bn of VAT


   By ANDREW JACK


CUSTOMS and Excise narrowly failed to meet its target of tracing Pounds 2bn
in underpayments of value added tax, its 1992-93 annual report says.
It traced Pounds 1.96bn, out of a total of Pounds 63.5bn in VAT and duties
raised during the year, up from Pounds 62.2bn in the previous 12 months.
Costs rose to Pounds 879m from Pounds 797m.
There were 1.63m traders registered for VAT during the year, down from
1.68m, with new registrations totalling 187,000. Total tax written off or
not pursued rose to Pounds 825m from Pounds 553m. Customs said the increase
reflected the effects of the recession and also cases being processed more
quickly.
The running costs of gathering trade statistics under the new European
Community single market were Pounds 14.7m, against a planned Pounds 15.9m.
During the year Customs seized consignments to Iraq in contravention of
United Nations sanctions valued at Pounds 181,606. It also brought
prosecutions against a company and its owner for the export of riot gear to
Angola without export licences.
