FT  11 JAN 92 / International Company News: France appoints Alain Prestat as
TCE chairman


   By WILLIAM DAWKINS


THE French government yesterday increased its influence at Thomson Consumer
Electronics (TCE), the state-owned maker of audio and video products, by
sending in a senior adviser of the prime minister as its chairman, writes
William Dawkins.
He is Mr Alain Prestat, 40, deputy chief of staff for Mrs Edith Cresson, who
was nominated as TCE's chairman after Mr Bernard Isautier resigned. The
change was expected, following the plans to merge the loss-making TCE with
CEA Industry, a profitable state-owned nuclear fuel group.
