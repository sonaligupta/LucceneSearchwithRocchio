FT  11 NOV 92 / International Company News: Shares in TNT plunge 29% after
poor result

TNT shares fell 22 cents to an all-time low of 53 cents yesterday after the
Australian transport group announced equity accounted net losses of ADollars
65.1m (USDollars 45.3m) after abnormals for the first quarter.
Analysts were surprised by the reaction to the poor result, which was widely
expected. Most said it in part reflected a lack of confidence on the
Australian Stock Exchange, where the All Ordinaries index closed at a
20-month low.
Directors faced angry questions at the annual meeting, with shareholders
forcing a ballot on a director's re-election. However, Mr Fred Millar,
chairman, said the group's financial position had improved since the end of
its financial year to June, when it reported net losses after abnormals of
ADollars 195m.
Mr Millar said the group expected to return to 'substantial' profits in
1993-1994, but was unlikely to pay a dividend until the following year.
Ansett, the airline group jointly owned with News Corporation, contributed
operating profits of ADollars 3.2m, marking a return to operating profits
after two years of heavy losses.
