FT  21 NOV 92 / World Commodities Prices: Spices


A softer trend has emerged in the pepper makret, reports Man-producten. A
general lack of fresh buying interest in most consuming markets created more
selling presure in most origins, resulting in declining prices of both black
and white pepper.  But when demand picks up prices will harden again.  White
pepper is available at Dollars 1.525 a tonne on the spot and at Dollars
1.475 cif for prompt shipment.  Black pepper stocks remain tight.  Hence the
premium price for ready goods at Dollars 1.400 to Dollars 1.450 ex-warehouse
whereas Dollar 1.250 to Dollars 1.300 cif is quoted for prompt shipment.
