FT  20 NOV 92 / Letter: Frustrations face those ready to 'seize' business
opportunities


   From Ms M E A BLACKBURN


Sir, I read with a mixture of interest, frustration and total amazement your
article ('Major will urge business to seize opportunities', November 16)
regarding the direct appeal made by John Major to 'British industry and
business to seize the opportunities on offer, as the government steps up its
efforts to create economic confidence',in his speech at the Lord Mayor's
banquet.
My company has recently had a planning application for change of use to A3 -
that is, restaurant - refused because of an objection by the National Rivers
Authority on the grounds that 'the development would increase unsatisfactory
discharges of sewage to the aquatic environment because of the inability of
the Heswall Sewage Treatment works and storm sewage overflows to cope
satisfactorily with existing flows of sewage to the public system.'
Our development would invest some Pounds 150,000, employ in excess of 20
full-time people and use the goods and services of local traders.
How is it possible to seize the opportunities on offer when the now
privatised Welsh Water's published investment programme for 1990-95 does not
include any improvements in this area and, as a consequence, the NRA has a
moratorium for the whole of this period on any planning applications? The
result is economic stagnation.
