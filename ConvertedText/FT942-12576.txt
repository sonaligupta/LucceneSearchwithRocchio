cent from the previous quarter, although it was 0.3 per cent up on a year

cent GDP expansion from the final three months of 1992.
German plant and machinery orders rose a real 7 per cent in March and by 3
per cent in the first quarter from a year earlier, the VDMA industry group
reported yesterday. Domestic orders for March were up 3 per cent while
foreign orders grew 11 per cent.
German inflation rose by 0.3 per cent in April over the previous month,
remaining at 3.2 per cent a year, the Federal Statistics Office announced
yesterday.
Belgium's annual inflation rate was a preliminary 2.41 per cent in April,
