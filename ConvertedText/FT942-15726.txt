FT  14 APR 94 / Rwanda battle intensifies

   KIGALI


Rwandan rebels and government troops fought pitched battles in the capital
Kigali yesterday as more than 100,000 refugees left the city, Agencies
report from Kigali.
Up to 20,000 troops of the rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front advanced from the
north to reinforce small groups already in the city. Members of the
provisional government completed a retreat to the countryside.
In New York, the United Nations Security Council was due to consult in
private last night. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general, after a
meeting on Tuesday night with Mr Willy Claes, foreign minister of Belgium,
the former colonial power, set out several options in a report to the
Security Council. These appeared to include abandoning the 2,500-strong
peacekeeping operation. However, the UN might instead 'add additional troops
(to) replace the Belgian troops in case they would withdraw'. Belgian radio
said yesterday that Mr Boutros Ghali had agreed Belgium could withdraw its
420-strong contingent of UN peacekeepers, ten of whom have been killed.
An estimated 20,000 people have been slain in Rwanda in a week, the latest
eruption of a long feud between the country's two main ethnic groups.
