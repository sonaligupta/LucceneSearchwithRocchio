FT  15 JUN 93 / Forecast tax rises held in Pakistani budget


   By FARHAN BOKHARI

THE PAKISTANI government last night unveiled the country's annual budget
which avoided some unpopular measures that businessmen had expected, though
it sought to widen the tax net.
Prices of petroleum products were increased by 10 per cent but costs of gas
and electricity remained unchanged. Petrol may rise further depending on the
the exchange rate of the Pakistani rupee against the dollar.
Sales tax was increased by 2.5 percentage points to 15 per cent. Mr Sartaj
Aziz, in his budget speech before the parliament, also announced a 2 per
cent duty surcharge on the cost of new commercial buildings in large urban
areas.
No tax was introduced on agricultural income. Pakistanis are exempt from
paying direct income tax on agriculture, a subject of criticism from foreign
donors. In recent days, many officials expected some form of tax, even in a
limited form, in response to those concerns.
The budget has come at a time of political uncertainty. Mr Aziz appealed to
the opposition to join in a bipartisan consensus on economic policies as a
way to encourage foreign invest-ors.
Many businessmen have recently expressed concern over a chronic budget
deficit which has repeatedly been responsible for Pakistan missing its
economic targets.
