   WARSAW


Poland yesterday got its fourth prime minister in the three years since the
fall of the communist regime when parliament voted in Mr Waldemar Pawlak, a
32-year-old farmer, as the head of government. writes Chistopher Bobinksi in
Warsaw.
The vote came yesterday afternoon, some 15 hours after parliament had
dismissed the previous cabinet on a motion from President Lech Walesa, who
followed through by proposing Mr Pawlak. Mr Pawlak heads the PSL farmers'
party, which in the past played a supportive role to the ruling communists.
