FT  15 APR 94 / Technology: Getting there by fuel cell


   By STEPHEN WISENTHAL


Just over 10 years ago, Ballard Power Systems took a second look at an all
but abandoned technology. Now the Canadian company which is working with
Daimler-Benz appears on the verge of a breakthrough in the efficient use of
clean, abundant energy from fuel cells. It has attracted attention with the
improvements it has made to a proton exchange membrane fuel cell pioneered
by General Electric of the US.
Paul Howard, Ballard's vice-president, says the GE system (developed for the
space programme) had been seen as too heavy, finicky and expensive. But in
1983, Ballard received a Canadian military contract for the fuel cells which
produce electricity directly from oxygen and hydrogen without combustion.
They work with a polymer membrane as the electrolyte between two thin layers
of platinum catalyst. These are sandwiched between two carbon electrodes.
When hydrogen is piped next to one electrode and oxygen next to the other, a
reaction occurs in the electrolyte, producing the electricity, heat and
water.
Ballard improved the GE technology and by 1987 was ready to produce its
first-generation 5 kW fuel cell, a series of electrodes, catalysts and
plastic membranes bolted together, weighing 50 kg. An array of 24 similar
cells, linked to an electric motor, powers its first test vehicle, a bus.
This first generation of fuel cells has been sold to motor companies,
including Daimler-Benz, for evaluation.
The next cells will generate more than twice as much power. In 1998,
Ballard, working with Johnson Matthey of the UK to reduce the amount of
platinum catalyst, plans to market the third and commercially viable phase.
The 25 kW fuel cells will drive a large bus with a range of 560 km. A fourth
generation 50 kW cell is at least 10 years away.
'We need to get to the power-to-weight ratio of an internal combustion
engine. Today, we're probably about five or 10 times away from that,' says
Howard. 'Automobiles in the future are going to be driven by fuel cells.
Batteries aren't going to get there.'
