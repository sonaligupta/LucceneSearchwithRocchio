FT  01 JUL 92 / Ramos declares as priority restoration of 'civic order'

MR Fidel Ramos, sworn in yesterday as the new president of the Philippines,
declared as his priority the restoration of 'civic order' in order that
business and the economy may prosper again.
In a speech capping the inaugural ceremonies, Mr Ramos said that 'without
stability, businesses cannot run, workers cannot create wealth, liberty
cannot flourish, and even individual life will be brutish and precarious'.
He also said he would seek amendments in the constitution to 'make our
political system fairer to all and more representative of the vastness and
variety of our country'.
That declaration was seen as Mr Ramos' consent to calls for a shift in the
form of government to a parliamentary system from the multi-party
presidential system, which over the past six years has contributed little to
development efforts.
Mr Ramos, who won the May 11 election with only 23.6 per cent of the vote,
said he would continue to reach out to all groups that participated in the
poll with the aim of putting an end to 'petty rivalries that have kept us
down'.
To 'nurse the economy back to health,' Mr Ramos said his administration
would concentrate on providing basic services and pursue deregulation and
privatisation.
The new president also paid tribute to former president, Mrs Corazon Aquino.
Yesterday's ceremony was the first peaceful transfer of power since 1965.
