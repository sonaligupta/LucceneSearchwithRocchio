FT  16 JAN 92 / International Company News: MIM slides 76% on lower metal
prices

MIM HOLDINGS, the Australian mining group, yesterday blamed lower base metal
prices and coal production problems for a 76 per cent fall in net operating
profits to ADollars 16m (USDollars 12.3m) for the six months to December 15.
The group made a profit of ADollars 61.7m after an abnormal profit of
ADollars 45.7m from the sale of its interest in Teck Corporation as part of
a deal in which it doubled its shareholding in Cominco, the zinc, lead and
copper producer, to 22.5 per cent.
However, after net exchange losses of ADollars 2.1m and minority interests
of ADollars 12.1m, net profit attributable to shareholders was ADollars
47.5m, an increase of 28 per cent on the comparable period of the previous
year.
MIM said sales fell from ADollars 935m to ADollars 840m, mainly because of
lower metal prices - copper prices fell by 15 per cent, lead by 32 per cent
and zinc by 27 per cent.
Copper production at the Mount Isa mine in Queensland was adversely affected
by contamination difficulties and abnormal winds on smelter operations.
The Oaky Creek coking coal operation suffered a loss of ADollars 24m for the
six months, mainly because of delays in the changeover from the first panel
in the longwall unit. Production from the second panel began in late
December.
MIM said that base metal prices remained weak because of a lack of demand
caused by the recession.
It added that signs of recovery in the US appeared to have been premature.
The directors declared an unfranked interim dividend of 2 cents a share, a
reduction of 1 cent on last year's interim dividend.
Highlands Gold, a 65 per cent subsidiary of MIM, reported net profits of
K26.9m (Dollars 28.3m) for the six months, compared with K10.5m the previous
year.
Highlands said the result was largely due to its share of production from
the Porgera gold mine, in the highlands of Papua New Guinea (PNG).
Highlands has a 30 per cent interest in the project, co-owned by Placer
Pacific (30 per cent), Renison Goldfields Consolidated (30 per cent) and the
PNG government (10 per cent.)
Highlands said that its share of Porgera sales for the six months amounted
to 197,800 ounces of gold and 63,400 ounces of silver, which provided
revenue of K40.7m before tax.
The company said Porgera had 'passed an important milestone' in the second
quarter, when a number of important construction projects were completed,
increasing the gold recovery rate.
The directors declared an interim dividend of 2 toea per share.
