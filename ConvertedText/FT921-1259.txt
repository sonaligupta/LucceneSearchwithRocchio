FT  25 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Acquisitions boost Brake Bros


   By ANGUS FOSTER


BRAKE BROS, which supplies frozen food to caterers, has bucked the recession
with increased profits and sales, helped by acquisitions.
Brake also outlined its strategy to move into chilled food distribution, an
area it has so far avoided. Mr Malcolm Champion, finance director, said
recent acquisitions gave the company a platform to move into chilled food
distribution.
Pre-tax profits for 1991 rose to Pounds 15.4m (Pounds 14.9m) on turnover 14
per cent higher at Pounds 223m (Pounds 195.4m). The turnover rise would have
been 7.3 per cent without acquisitions.
Mr Champion said he was very pleased with the results, which were
overshadowed by a depressed catering market and a fire at the company's cold
storage facility in West Yorkshire. Losses were fully insured and the
facility is due to be operational in the next few weeks. Nevertheless,
delays associated with the fire held back growth elsewhere, Mr Champion
said.
During the year, Brake spent Pounds 3.4m acquiring four businesses in London
and the Midlands supplying fresh fish and chilled foods. Brake believes its
distribution and purchasing experience can improve these businesses. They
also provide an entry into the quality hotel and restaurant sector, which
usually avoids frozen foods.
Since the end of the year, Brake has bought a small frozen food distributor
in France and further acquisitions are being targeted in the UK and
continental Europe. Net borrowings at the year end totalled Pounds 2m, for
gearing of 5 per cent.
Earnings per share increased 9 per cent to 23.8p (21.8p). A recommended
final dividend of 4.1p brings the total to 5.75p (5.25p), a 9.5 per cent
increase.
