FT  27 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Dissent because of misleading figures


   From Mr DONALD A MAIN


Sir, In his article (The Long View: 'When numbers deceive', September 24),
Barry Riley expresses his concern at the obstacles in the way of measuring
true performance. In the process, he castigates those who do not report
return on capital and those who have problems with the latest accounting
standard concerning acquisitions. One effect of new accounting rules passed
by the majority of the Accounting Standards Board is that figures for return
on capital will become increasingly misleading because reported capital will
not contain the total cost of acquisitions.
This was one reason for my dissenting opinion at the ASB.
