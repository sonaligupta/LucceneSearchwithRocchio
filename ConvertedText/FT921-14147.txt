FT  17 JAN 92 / UK Company News: SW Wood issue to fund Pounds 3m expansion


SW Wood, the metals trader which recently diversified into packaging and
printing with August's acquisition of Proofed Packaging Printers, has made
another purchase in the sector.
It has acquired Grange Group, a specialist magazine printer, for an initial
Pounds 1.37m cash and the issue of 2.34m new ordinary shares. At Wednesday's
closing price of 72 1/2 p, the aggregate consideration is Pounds 3.06m.
Further consideration, up to a maximum of Pounds 1m, is dependent of
Grange's pre-tax profits in 1992 and is payable in cash or shares, as Wood
chooses.
Wood is financing the initial cash element of the acquisition with a placing
and open offer of 3.91m new ordinary shares at 65p apiece to raise Pounds
2.1m net. The offer is on a 1-for-2 basis. The balance of the proceeds will
increase cash resources.
Grange made pre-tax profits of Pounds 273,000 in the nine months to
September 30 1991 and net assets were Pounds 872,000 at that date. More than
half its current turnover derives from regular journal work from publishers
such as Euromoney, Centaur and International Thomson.
