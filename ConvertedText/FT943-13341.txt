FT  20 JUL 94 / Recruitment: Research leads recovery


   By RICHARD DONKIN


Advertised demand for executives continues to show a steady upward trend,
according to the latest quarterly survey by MSL International, the
recruitment consultant.
The MSL Index of advertised demand for executives, which, its compilers say,
has unfailingly predicted the ups and downs of the British economy for more
than three decades, has risen again in the second quarter of the year.
The index - a 12-month running total that irons out seasonal variances  -
now stands at 79 against the 1959 base figure of 100.
After hitting an all-time low in the second quarter of 1992 and languishing
there to the middle of last year, the number of senior level appointments
began to rise and the latest figures show a rise for the fourth consecutive
quarter.
Ian Lloyd, MSL International's managing director, said: 'The latest figures
tell us that the recovery is firmly established.'
Recruiting has been particularly strong in research and development and in
marketing and sales, both areas which reflect confidence in long term
business prospects and investment for growth.
Activity in accounting and finance on a par with recruitment in marketing
leads Lloyd to conclude that investment is being tempered with a greater
degree of caution and control than in the 1980s.
Recruitment in high technology industries is showing the largest sectoral
rise: increasing 12 per cent on the last quarter and 89 per cent over the
same quarter in 1993, while advertised demand in the retail sector has
fallen 32 per cent in the quarter and is down 11 per cent on a year ago.
The graphs on the right show the sector and industry changes and the
movement in the index. This still has some way to go before it reflects
executive recruitment levels throughout most of the 1980s.
