FT  27 MAR 92 / Maxwell wine sale realises Pounds 93,000


THE AUCTION of Robert Maxwell's private wine collection yesterday raised
more than Pounds 93,000 towards the debts accumulated by the media magnate.
Bidders paid on average 20 per cent above the market average for bottles
including an Imperiale 1982 Chateau Figeac which went for Pounds 650.
Curiosity value in the Maxwell cellar, which boasted 3,000 bottles and 772
magnums, pushed prices beyond trade values, and most successful bidders at
the Christie's sale said the wine was for display rather than drinking. Some
customers were even heard asking auction staff about display cabinets
immediately after the sale.
The sale attracted bids from Japan, Israel and the US. Even the 40 lots of
lacklustre burgundy from a single obscure supplier (Albert Ponelle) were not
spurned.
Most of the wines, however, were famous-name 1982 clarets that had been
acquired by Maxwell at a Sotheby's sale in 1985. It followed the disposal of
his previous, more mature but less glamorous collection, on the advice of Mr
David Molyneux-Berry, former head of Sotheby's wine department.
At a sale in 1985, Maxwell bid personally and vigorously, pushing the price
of a dozen bottles of Chateau Latour 1982, for example, to Pounds 800.
Yesterday that same wine sold for exactly Pounds 800.
