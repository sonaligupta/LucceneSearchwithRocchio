FT  21 DEC 92 / Insurers hopeful on deal for terror cover


   By JOHN AUTHERS and ALISON SMITH


THE insurance industry is expecting a government decision this week on the
controversial issue of insuring property against terrorist attack.
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, has come under
pressure to intervene since the Association of British Insurers recommended
last month that its members should withdraw terrorism cover from commercial
insurance policies, after the withdrawal from the market of some large
reinsurers.
The ABI believes that the government should meet part of the bill for
mainland terrorist damage in future.
The deadline to the discussions between the Department of Trade and Industry
and the ABI, which arises from the expiry of many companies' existing
insurance policies at the end of this month, has given an element of
brinkmanship to the final negotiations.
The solution favoured by some Tory MPs would involve the government in
taking on the position of 'insurer of last resort' - insurers would charge a
levy on premiums to go towards a special fund for terrorism damage, and the
government would pay for any liabilities beyond that figure.
The ABI - which said yesterday it hoped Mr Heseltine would make an
announcement before Christmas - seems likely to accept that offer, and is
now less optimistic that the government will take responsibility for the
cost of all terrorism damage, as it currently does in Northern Ireland.
