FT  15 JUN 93 / International Company News: BP France chairman to resign in
September


   By REUTER


   PARIS


BP France said its chairman, Mr Raymond Bloch, will resign on September 30
and will be replaced by managing director Mr Paul Castellan, Reuter reports
from Paris.
Mr Bloch, 54, said the development of BP France over the last few years was
such that it no longer required both a chairman and a managing director. Mr
Bloch will remain a member of the board.
The company said the decision was made before British Petroleum announced on
June 9 an offer for the 14 per cent of shares in BP France that it does not
already own.
