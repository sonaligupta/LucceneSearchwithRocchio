FT  04 AUG 92 / BA cabin crew strike called off


UNION leaders have called off strike action over pay and conditions by
British Airways cabin crews due to start at midnight last night.
The TGWU general union, which represents crews, decided to call off the
action by domestic and European crews after a series of mass meetings at the
weekend at which members indicated that support for action today was weak.
The airline said that union negotiators decided against action after British
Airways indicated that it would meet for talks if the strike threat was
lifted. Last night the talks were still going on as both sides expressed
optimism about prospects for agreement.
