FT  21 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading


   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE


NEWS from the Gatt talks gave a quiet session in the derivatives market a
positive and lively flourish, writes Christopher Price.
The December contract opened firm at 2,719, before drifting back as the
10.30am deadline for expiry of the November index options approached,
hitting its low of 2,710 at around 10am.
A positive opening on Wall Street lightened the mood which turned to
something approaching euphoria when news on the Gatt negotiations came into
the market at around 3.30pm. December raced forward as buyers rushed in and
some traders were caught short, reaching its high of the day of 2,757
shortly before the close.
It finally finished at 2,751, 25 points ahead of the previous session and
around an 11-point premium to its fair value level of nine. Volume was 7,496
contracts.
A busy day in the options market saw 34,231 trades. Rolls-Royce was the top
stock option, with 2,281 contracts, including a seller of 1,000 of the
December 90 calls at 10p.
