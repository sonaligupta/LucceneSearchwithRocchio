FT  10 JAN 92 / International Company News: Decline in cross-border deals


   By GUY DE JONQUIERES


THE VALUE of cross-border mergers and acquisitions fell 55 per cent last
year to Dollars 51.9bn, according to management consultants KPMG Peat
Marwick. That is the lowest level since KPMG began recording deals in 1988.
The number of deals fell less sharply to 1,793 from 2,725 the previous year.
There were only five deals worth more than Dollars 1bn each, compared with
23 in 1990.
For the first time in four years, the European Community overtook the US to
become the most popular target region for takeovers. Cross-border sales of
EC companies totalled Dollars 23.3bn, compared with sales of US companies
worth Dollars 18.7bn.
The US remained the single most popular target country, followed by Britain,
where sales totalled Dollars 9.1bn, compared with Dollars 20.4bn in 1990.
Cross-border purchases by British companies fell to Dollars 6.3bn from
Dollars 20.6bn the previous year.
The strongest activity last year was in the final quarter, when the
worldwide value of deals reached Dollars 15.1 bn. However, KPMG said that
was less than half the level a year earlier, and did not signal a recovery
in the cross-border M&A market.
Nonetheless, KPMG cautiously forecast increased cross-border M&A activity
this year in several sectors, including food, drink and pharmaceuticals. It
also expected foreign purchases of UK media companies to increase.
