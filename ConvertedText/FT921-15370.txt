FT  10 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Minister rejects safety legislation


   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff


THE GOVERNMENT has rejected proposals to make named company managers and
directors personally responsible for workplace deaths and accidents, the
construction union Ucatt said yesterday
After a meeting on safety with Mr Eric Forth, the employment minister, Ucatt
leaders said: 'Eric Forth took the union by surprise by saying that he felt
that the prosecution of management for health and safety violations was not
productive and, in fact, amounted to a misuse of resources.'
Unions and pressure groups have recently campaigned for changes in the law
to increase the accountability of company directors and make corporate
manslaughter charges easier to bring to the courts.
Construction has the poorest safety record of all sectors, with deaths
running at five times the rate among workers in manufacturing. One building
worker is killed every three days.
Ucatt said it was 'shock-ed' by Mr Forth's comments.
The Department of Employment said Mr Forth told Ucatt that prosecution of
managers was 'not always the best way forward and that there may be better
ways of using resources'. He had 'listened intently' to the union.
In a statement Mr Forth said: 'My key message is that managers and workers
themselves have primary responsibility for making their own construction
sites safer.'
Separately, Mr George Henderson, national construction secretary of the TGWU
general union, called for the resignation of Mr Stephen Moon, a senior
official of the Building Employers' Confederation.
Mr Moon had written to BEC member companies saying there was nothing to stop
contractors allowing the EETPU electricians union on to sites traditionally
dominated by Ucatt and the TGWU.
