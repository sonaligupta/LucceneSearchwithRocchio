FT  24 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Clarke Hooper shares suspended


   By GARY MEAD


The severity of the recession in the marketing sector was highlighted
yesterday as Clarke Hooper, the USM-traded sales promotion company,
requested suspension of its shares pending the outcome of discussions over
its future, writes Gary Mead.
The shares were suspended at 1 3/4 p; three years ago they traded at 163p.
The group has been struggling with shrinking marketing and promotional
expenditure by companies.
In July it recorded a pre-tax loss of Pounds 3.45m for 1991-92 compared with
profits of Pounds 2.05m for the previous year. Turnover fell by 11 per cent
to Pounds 44.5m.
