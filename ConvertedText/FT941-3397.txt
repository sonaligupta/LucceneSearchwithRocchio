FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Delta falls slightly to Pounds 53.4m -
Dividend increase reflects company's optimism on prospects


   By ANDREW BOLGER


Delta, the cables and engineering group, reported flat annual results
yesterday, but signalled guarded optimism about the economic outlook by
increasing its dividend for the first time since 1990.
Pre-tax profits dipped from Pounds 55.1m to Pounds 53.4m in the year to
January 1, mainly because of higher interest charges following its Pounds
37m purchase of the outstanding 36 per cent stake in Delta Crompton Cable
Holdings from BTR, the industrial conglomerate. Sales rose from Pounds 786m
to Pounds 833m.
Earnings per share increased marginally to 23.1p (23p). A final dividend of
10.3p lifts the total to 14.5p (14p).
Mr Robert Easton, chief executive, said Delta was one of the first UK
companies to freeze dividends as the downturn took hold, but now hoped it
had seen the bottom of the recession in continental Europe.
The upbeat tone was carefully qualified by Delta, which in September saw its
shares marked down sharply after it warned that the UK recovery in
manufacturing was more anaemic than many observers were suggesting.
Mr Geoffrey Wilson, chairman, said yesterday: 'Whilst current patterns of
demand remain patchy, early indications suggest a strengthening in some
sectors. Whilst we have seen transient effects before, there is now greater
evidence to suggest that the economic tide may be finally on the turn.'
Delta said it was another tough year, with continuing depressed and fiercely
competitive trading. European construction markets showed little recovery.
Mr Wilson said: 'Early signs of more encouraging activity in the UK soon
relapsed and demand then persisted at depressed levels. Prices remained
under pressure, particularly in cables.'
Delta shed 800 jobs last year, bringing the total employed down to 13,300.
The group has cut its workforce by a third since 1989. Mr Easton said he
would 'go on trimming - but the battle will moderate'.
The cables division suffered particularly from UK price wars, with operating
profits lower at Pounds 5.89m (Pounds 8.68m). Circuit protection dipped to
Pounds 15.8m (Pounds 17.1m) and engineering to Pounds 19.9 (Pounds 22.2m).
Industrial services however, rose to Pounds 18.5m (Pounds 12.8m).
COMMENT
Actions speak louder than words, and Delta's willingness to let dividend
cover fall to 1.6 strikes a more positive note than the chairman's heavily
hedged statement on prospects. Analysts were struck by how tough things were
in the cable market, but still believe Delta's willingness to reduce its
cost base makes it heavily geared to any upturn. Action, rather than further
talk, on a possible US acquisition would also be appreciated. The shares,
down 7p to 522p, are on a prospective multiple of about 19. The 20 per cent
premium to the market reflects Delta's recovery stock status, but does not
look unjustified.
