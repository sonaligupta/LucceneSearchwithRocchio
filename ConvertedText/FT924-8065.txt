FT  13 NOV 92 / Japan's trade surplus rises to record Dollars 10.9bn

A SURGE in Japanese car exports to Europe was one of the main forces behind
a 51 per cent increase in Japan's custom cleared trade surplus in October to
a record Dollars 10.9bn (Pounds 7.17bn), according to figures published
yesterday by the finance ministry.
The higher-than-expected growth in the surplus was due to continued growth
in exports, which were 9.2 per cent up on last year at Dollars 31bn and a
5.1 per cent fall in imports to Dollars 20.1bn, reflecting the slowdown in
the Japanese economy.
The growth in the surplus to Dollars 88bn for the first ten months of the
year, already Dollars 6bn more than the 1991 surplus, is likely to add to
international pressure on the Japanese government to stimulate the economy
to revive imports.
The surge in car exports to Europe, which was one of the main factors behind
a Dollars 2.8bn surplus with the EC, is likely to fuel protectionism among
Europe's hard-pressed car producers, which are facing serious problems of
over-capacity.
While Japanese car exports to Europe and Asia are rising rapidly, export
growth to the US is minimal.
Vehicle exports to the EC were 25.6 per cent up on October last year at
Dollars 753m, while exports of car parts were 43 per cent higher at Dollars
166m. Vehicle exports to Asia were 50.7 per cent up at Dollars 640m, with
exports of motor-cycles up 107 per cent at Dollars 91m.
In contrast automobile exports to the US rose by just 1.8 per cent to
Dollars 2.2bn.
Finance ministry officials believe most of the growth in the value of the
overall surplus can be explained by a fall in import prices for commodities
and a rise in export prices, in part reflecting the appreciation of the yen
over the past year. However, they are braced for the surplus to generate
political pressure in the US for the incoming Clinton administration to take
a tough line on trade.
The surplus with the US stood at Dollars 4.9bn, with exports up 8.2 per cent
from last year at Dollars 9.3bn and imports down 8.1 per cent at Dollars
4.37bn. Exports to the EC were 5.5 per cent up at Dollars 5.3bn, with
imports 9.8 per cent down at Dollars 2.5bn.
China is one of the few countries to be increasing its imports into the
depressed Japanese market. Imports from China rose by 10.7 per cent to
Dollars 1.7bn, while Japanese exports to China were 44 per cent up at
Dollars 1.16bn.
Raw material imports fell by 4.5 per cent to Dollars 2.1bn, machinery and
equipment imports were 13.2 per cent down at Dollars 3.45bn and mineral fuel
imports rose by just 0.2 per cent to Dollars 4.42bn.
