FT  27 MAR 92 / UK Company News: United Newspapers drops to Pounds 85m


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


UNITED NEWSPAPERS, the publisher of the Daily Express, Sunday Express, Daily
Star and Yorkshire Post, yesterday announced an 11 per cent drop in pre-tax
profits to Pounds 85.2m in 1991, against Pounds 95.7m last time.
Lord Stevens, chairman, said the results illustrated the depth and the
extent of the recession and were 'not unreasonable in the circumstances'.
He added that, although 1992 had started somewhat better than expected in
the UK and the US, the outlook in the UK was heavily dependent on the result
of next month's general election and its effect on economic recovery.
Turnover slipped to Pounds 812.6m (Pounds 829.1m) and earnings per share
fell to 27.1p (31.7p). Despite the effect of recession on the group, it is
holding its final dividend at 13.5p for an unchanged total of 21p. The
shares rose 13p to close at 373p.
Lord Stevens said he was particularly encouraged by the way costs had been
controlled and by the improved perfortions, from advertising-supported
magazines in the US, and from Extel Financial and Express Newspapers in the
UK.
Mr Neil Blackley, media analyst at James Capel, the stockbroker, said that
the results were a lot better than many people had expected and that many
parts of the company were poised for growth once the recession ended.
'I think the quality of the portfolio is improving,' he said, adding that
the Sunday Express had improved its share of the Sunday market and the Daily
Express was holding its own. The Daily Star, after poor sales averaging
about 786,000 in February, had shot up to more than 825,000 in March.
Part of the cost-cutting had come from closing uneconomic titles. The
process continued this week when the group announced that Punch would close
on April 8 unless a buyer was found.
Mr Graham Wilson, United managing director, said that although there had
been numerous expressions of interests no concrete bids for the 150-year-old
humour magazine had yet been submitted.
Overall, Mr Wilson said he planned to continue to publish aggressively, to
increase market share and to go for growth.
Profits of United's national newspapers actually rose slightly from Pounds
23.8m to Pounds 24.3m and there was only a 6 per cent drop in regional
newspaper profits to Pounds 27.1m despite a 31 per cent fall in situations
vacant advertising.
Advertising periodicals had profits of Pounds 30.1m (Pounds 32.1m) but
magazines and exhibitions fell more sharply from Pounds 29.6m to Pounds
21.4m.
