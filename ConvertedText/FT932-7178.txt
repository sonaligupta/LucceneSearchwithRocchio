FT  25 MAY 93 / International Company News: Rationalisation lifts Incentive
to SKr83m

PROFITS at Sweden's Incentive, the industrial group controlled by the
Wallenberg family, were up by 54 per cent in the first quarter to SKr83m
(Dollars 11.38m), excluding associated companies, from SKr54m despite flat
demand in the group's main European markets which left sales unchanged at
SKr2.98bn.
Incentive attributed the improved profitability to a rationalisation
programme aimed at narrowing the group's focus on core engineering
operations.
Last week, it announced the sale of its US hydraulics group, Hagglunds
Denison Hydraulics, which has sales of around Dollars 100m, to a group of
Swedish, US and British investors.
Mr Mikael Lilius, chief executive, said the effects of last autumn's
devaluation of the Swedish kroner would have a positive impact on full-year
earnings, which were forecast to improve over last year's SKr371m, excluding
associated companies.
First-quarter profits after inclusion of income from shareholdings in Asea,
Electrolux and Esab were SKr282m, compared with SKr238m a year ago.
Earnings per share, excluding non-recurring items, were up 5 per cent at
SKr2, compared with SKr1.90.
