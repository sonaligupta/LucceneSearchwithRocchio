FT  01 JUL 92 / World Trade News: US steel 'dumping' list hits new peak


   By NANCY DUNNE


   WASHINGTON


TWELVE US steel companies yesterday filed 84 trade complaints against 21
foreign countries in their latest attempt to counter flat-rolled steel
imports and trading practices they claim are unfair.
Led by the six biggest integrated steel companies, the producers submitted
to the US Commerce Department and the International Trade Commission the
most extensive set of 'unfair trade cases' in the industry's history. The
same strategy in the 1980s forced foreign governments to agree 'voluntary'
restraint agreements in exchange for an end to expensive trade action.
Mr Thomas Usher, president of US Steel Group, said an exhaustive review of
international trading patterns showed many governments continued to
'massively subsidise' their steel exports and 'systematically' dump them in
the US 'at prices far below fair market value and often below' production
cost. Despite Dollars 23bn (Pounds 12.4bn) spent to modernise the industry,
the steelmakers last year lost more than Dollars 2.2bn, he added. 'Another
Dollars 108m was lost in the first quarter of the year; results for the
second will also be unsatisfactory.'
Almost all major steel-producing countries were named. Britain was accused
of subsiding its steel production by 20.15 per cent and selling its exports
in the US market at 18.05-114.81 per cent below what US law considers fair
market value. Germany was accused of 5.39-64.46 per cent subsidies and
1.97-64.46 per cent dumping margins. Also named were Argentina, Australia,
Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Finland, France, Italy, Japan, Korea,
Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Romania, Spain, Sweden and Taiwan.
The steel producers ignored pleas by US steel trading companies to refrain.
The producers are led by USX, Bethlehem Steel, LTV, Inland Steel, Armco and
National Steel.
