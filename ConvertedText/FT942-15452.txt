FT  15 APR 94 / World Trade News: Agenda takes shape for new trade
negotiations


   By FRANCES WILLIAMS


   MARRAKESH


The 120-plus nations at the Gatt ministerial meeting in Marrakesh have begun
to set the agenda for future trade negotiations - even before the formal
signing today of the Uruguay Round world trade accords. Ministers yesterday
adopted a series of decisions relating to the new World Trade Organisation
to be set up next year. In particular they have agreed to establish a
preparatory committee which, among other things, will be charged with
discussing items for the WTO's initial work programme.
They are also establishing a committee with a wide-ranging brief to examine
links between trade and the environment.
This week's meeting presages a delicate task for the preparatory committee
in striking the right balance in the WTO's negotiating agenda between the
interests of rich and poor nations, and in honing the list to manageable
proportions.
Pressure from industrialised countries, led by the US, to make workers'
rights a priority has antagonised developing countries and sparked calls for
negotiations on many issues, from labour mobility to company law.
Arguing that the rich nations already stand to corner the lion's share of
Uruguay Round benefits, developing countries this week have come up with an
alternative agenda.
Their ministers have urged discussion of labour mobility, restrictive
business practices of multinational corporations, commodities trade and
fluctuating exchange rates.
Developing countries also want stronger WTO mechanisms to help them expand
export capacity and to compensate Round losers through aid and debt relief.
Meanwhile, the European Union and others have proposed discussions on
competition policy, Japan wants regional trade blocs and investment rules on
the agenda, and Italy has suggested study of the harmonisation of company
and commercial law.
On trade and the environment, where a work programme has been agreed,
developing countries were eventually won over by assurances in the new
committee's brief that they faced no threat from disguised protectionism
under environmental cover.
Even so, this week's meeting has demonstrated continued suspicion of western
motives, reinforced by the vigorous lobbying of environmental groups which
want trade rules subservient to 'green' objectives.
Even more concern has been voiced by developing countries about putting
workers' rights on the agenda. Though they managed last week to head off a
US bid to have a reference to 'internationally recognised labour standards'
in today's ministerial declaration, the issue is expected to be mentioned,
along with others, in the chairman's concluding statement.
Speaking to the FT yesterday, Sir Leon Brittan, EU trade commissioner, said
the next stage had to be a 'hearts and minds operation' to calm Third World
suspicions that workers' rights were not simply a code word for raising
trade barriers against low-wage countries.
He emphasised that low wages and inadequate social security systems were not
unfair trading practices but a legitimate source of comparative advantage.
Any agreement would have to be a multilateral one, with no scope for
unilateral application of trade rules.
However, the facade of EU unity on the matter was sharply questioned
yesterday by Mr Gunter Rexrodt, German economics minister. He said that the
Commission, as well as the 12 member governments, remained divided on the
issue.

The circuitous route from Punta del Este to Marrakesh
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
1986
Punta del Este

gets services, intellectual property and foreign investment restrictions
on to agenda. EC reluctantly agrees to inclusion of agriculture.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
1987
Worldwide
Negotiations begin in 15 subject areas. US puts foward plan to scrap all
farm subsidies within 10 years. EC reacts with incredulity.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Montreal
Mid-term review. Agricultural discord prevents agreement on intellectual
property, emergency import protection and textiles. Negotiating
framework for services, improved disputes settlement agreed.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Geneva
US backs down on farm subsidies, with final agreement referring only to
'substantial progressive reductions' in trade-distorting farm supports.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
1990
Geneva, Houston, Brussels
US blocks preference for 'formula' which would force bigger cuts in high
tariffs. G7 pledges to complete Round by year-end, a pledge repeated in
next three years, stretching G7 credibility. Discussions continue to
founder over agriculture.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
1991
Washington, Geneva, Brussels
President Bush gets Congress to approve two-year extension of

EC agrees to reform Common Agriculture Policy. US agrees with EC terms
for reducing EC subsidised farm exports. 'Blair House accord' paves way
for resumption of overall negotiations.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
1993
Washington, Geneva, Tokyo
Congress gives President Clinton 'fast-track' authority but sets
deadline for final draft. G7 summit agrees tariff-cutting package.
Country-by-country bargaining leads to agreement to submit final package
to all governments.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
1994
Marrakesh
After countries submit tariff schedules and the US and developing
countries settle remaining disputes, ministers from about 120 countries
sign the Final Act to replace the Gatt with the new WTO in 1995.
