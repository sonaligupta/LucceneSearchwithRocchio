FT  08 JUN 92 / International Company News: Voest Stahl set back by weak
steel prices

VOEST Stahl, the Austrian steelmaker, saw operating income halved last year
to Sch624m (Dollars 55.4m) from Sch1.29bn because of weak steel prices and
losses from specialty steel production.
However, Mr Ludwig von Bogdandy, chairman, said he expected a slight
improvement in the 1992 results following restructuring at the steel and
specialty steel divisions.
The steel company is the largest subsidiary of the state-owned holding
concern Austrian Industries (AI), which is faced with massive losses at its
aluminium unit AMAG.
There has been talk that Mr Rudolf Streicher, who last month lost the
election for Austria's presidency against Mr Thomas Klestil, might take over
from Mr von Bogdandy at Voest. Mr Streicher is an experienced industrial
manager.
Voest's 1991 after-tax income dropped only 19 per cent to Sch285m from
Sch350, helped by extraordinary results. Group sales advanced 20 per cent to
Sch55.1bn because of the takeover of the Swedish specialty steel company
Uddeholm and other smaller foreign acquisitions.
Uddeholm has been merged with Voest's troubled specialty steel unit Boehler,
which suffered a loss of Sch1.2bn last year. The combined unit is expected
to swing to profit in 1993.
