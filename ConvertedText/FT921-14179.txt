FT  17 JAN 92 / Arts: Today's Television


   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY


At the time of writing no rating is available for the opening episode of
BBC1's Grace And Favour (8.00) but since this is simply 'Are You Being
Served' with added horse manure it seems likely it will be hugely popular.
The crowd that used to use double entendres to run a department store are
now running a country hotel using the same lines. Easily the best of the new
drama series this year is Love Hurts (9.30 BBC1), in which the delightful
Zoe Wanamaker plays a yuppie applying her skills to a charity and Adam Faith
is a cockney plumber made good who fancies her, but is having great trouble
getting his wicked way.
In The Washington Version (9.30) BBC2 continues its inside account of how
the Gulf War was managed. The Wicker Man (midnight BBC1) is a genuinely
scary movie, somewhat unexpectedly since it is set on a Scottish island and
stars Edward Woodward as a policeman. He discovers that old pagan rituals
are still going on. Anthony Shaffer wrote the script and (give a cheer) we
are promised this is the fully restored version lasting not 86 but 90
minutes. If you get really frightened you can always switch to C4 and sing
along to 'The Time Warp' in The Rocky Horror Show (12.05).
