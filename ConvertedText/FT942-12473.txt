FT  29 APR 94 / Arts: Today's Television


   By ANTONY THORNCROFT


The BBC's new classic serial, Hard Times, starts today - at noon on BBC 2.
It may be perverse of the BBC to put together such a splendid cast,
including Alan Bates, Bob Peck and Harriet Wilson, in the Dickens tale of
class strife in the industrial north, and screen it at such an odd hour. But
it demonstrates a continuing commitment to culture and education.
Television's two obsessions - sickness and crime - can be seen tonight. In
Secret Service (BBC 1, 7pm), Dylan Winter takes a hidden camera into the
maternity unit of Lincoln County Hospital and sits with pregnant women
waiting for their waters to burst.
Then on ITV at 9pm, Crime Story recreates a 1977 crime in which a conman
becomes a butler with the aim of preying on a rich woman. He finds he enjoys
the life, and all is well until an acquaintance from his past arrives on the
scene.
Late Friday night is the time for oddities, and there are few things wierder
than Eurotrash (Channel 4, 11.05pm), in which Jean-Paul Gaultier and Antoine
de Caunes make indifferent film clips strangely beguiling.
