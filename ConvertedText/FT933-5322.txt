FT  03 SEP 93 / Foreign Exchanges: D-Mark rampant in Europe


   By JAMES BLITZ


THE D-Mark performed power-fully against most currencies yesterday, sending
the dollar down to a new low and pushing currencies in Europe's exchange
rate mechanism to new levels of divergence, writes James Blitz.
In recent days, the D-Mark has moved up across the board, partly because of
a perception that central banks need to buy the currency to help balance
their reserves after the Bundesbank's ERM intervention last month.
New worries about the strength of the US economy have also forced the dollar
down below the 1992 peak for the dollar/D-Mark exchange rate.
When European trading opened yesterday, the D-Mark was already performing
strongly against the Japanese yen, starting an assault on the currency that
was to take it from Y63.64 to Y64.24 at the close.
Belgium's decision to raise its short-term interest rates by a full
percentage point later triggered a new attack on European currencies.
Several dealers said Belgium's tight monetary policy in support of its
currency was literally incredible, coming on a day when it reported a rise
in unemployment from July's 13.5 per cent to 14.1 per cent in August.
The Belgian franc dropped from a close on Wednesday night of BFr21.49
against the D-Mark to a low of BFr21.55. It later rallied to end at
BFr21.49. The Belgian authorities intervened to support the currency, saying
they had spent BFr3bn. A London dealer said his own dealing room has seen
three times that much.
Mr Mark Austin, currency strategist at Midland Global Markets, said
Belgium's attempts to peg the Belgian franc to the D-Mark were folly and
could exacerbate the downward pressure on the currency in the near term.
'Belgium could be doing a Sweden,' he added, recalling the large devaluation
of the Swedish krona last year after the country pushed short-term rates up
to very high levels.
Yesterday's events triggered a sharp depreciation in most European
currencies against the D-Mark. The French franc dropped from FFr3.507 to
close at FFr3.522, the Danish krone fell from DKr4.11 to DKr4.14 and
sterling was down from DM2.5025 to DM2.4750.
The dollar also came under strong pressure against the D-Mark, undermined
again by more poor US data. Factory goods orders for July fell 2.1 per cent,
worse than the market's already pessimistic forecast of a 1.7 per cent drop.
The US currency ended at DM1.6490 from a previous DM1.6595. Dealers
continued to focus on today's non-farm payroll figure as the most important
indicator of where the dollar is going in the short term. Expectations are
for a rise of 144,000 in the headline figure for August, but some analysts
wondered last night whether recent data hinted at a lower number. In New
York the dollar finished around DM1.6450.
