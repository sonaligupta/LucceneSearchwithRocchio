FT  16 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: EU agriculture ministers agree
environmental set-aside plan


   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES


European Union farm ministers agreed yesterday to draw up new rules on
cereal acreage set-aside enabling farmers to plant trees or opt for
environmental improvement schemes on idled land.
Farmers are required to set aside 12 per cent of their arable land this year
in an effort to curb over-production of cereals. Under the current rules,
producers are not allowed to use land planted with trees or turned over to
environmental management schemes to count towards their set-aside
allocation. Environmentalists say this has discouraged many farmers from
taking up some of the schemes that are available.
The UK has been pushing hard for a change in the set-aside rules and
welcomed the council's commitment to link market and environmental
set-aside. The European Commission will now draw up formal proposals.
Mr William Waldegrave, UK agriculture minister, said: 'The Commission's
report endorses our view that we should be allowed to promote more
environmentally sensitive use of set-aside, especially on marginal land'.
Farmers are expected to be able to put their set aside land into a variety
of schemes including: recreating flood meadows, grazing marshes and other
wetlands, re-establishing lowland heath land, creating reed-beds to benefit
wildlife as well as planting trees.
The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds said the decision 'has taken a
very important step towards restoring the UK countryside'.
