FT  28 JAN 94 / School heads approve tests


National curriculum tests seem certain to take place in most schools this
summer, following advice from the National Association of Head Teachers that
its members should implement the tests.
Last year NAHT members at their annual conference jeered and hissed at Mr
John Patten, the education secretary, and supported the three main teachers'
unions which boycotted the tests.
