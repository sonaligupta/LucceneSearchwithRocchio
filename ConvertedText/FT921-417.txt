FT  30 MAR 92 / Dubcek to head party


   By REUTER


   PRAGUE


FORMER Communist leader Alexander Dubcek has been elected chairman of the
Slovak Social Democratic party, the official news agency CSTK said
yesterday, Reuter reports from Prague.
Mr Dubcek, 70, joined the Social Democrats only two weeks ago and was
elected at a party congress in Bratislava on Saturday, CSTK said.
Living in disgrace since his 'Prague Spring' reforms were crushed in August
1968, he returned to public life only after the peaceful overthrow of
communist rule in late 1989.
Mr Dubcek told the congress the main planks of his party policy were to
achieve an environmentally-oriented and socially just market economy.
'Our aim is a united Europe and a dignified place for Czechoslovakia in it,'
he said.
