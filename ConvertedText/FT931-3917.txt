FT  13 MAR 93 / Clean-up plan for east Germany

THE German government yesterday unveiled a DM15bn (Pounds 6.3bn) clean-up
budget, aimed in part to attract foreign investors, for one of eastern
Germany's most polluted regions.
The federal government, through the Treuhandanstalt, the agency responsible
for the privatisation of the eastern German economy, will provide up to
DM15bn over the next five years.
'Germany has to carry the environmental burden, not the investor,' the
Treuhandanstalt said yesterday, but added that the technical details about
raising the money had yet to be decided.
In principle, the federal government has agreed to provide 75 per cent of
the costs, while the state which is home to the pollution must meet the
remaining quarter.
'The point is that no foreign investor is going to come and buy the large
chemical industries or mining sector if they know they have to carry the
clean-up bill as well,' the an Environmental Ministry official said.
The budget is earmarked for the triangle linking Halle, Leipzig and
Bitterfeld, former centres of the chemical and lignite mining areas. These
enterprises, each employing thousands of workers, remain under the control
of the Treuhand. The agency's ability to sell them may be increased
following this massive injection of capital.
