   HONG KONG


Citibank yesterday became the first bank in Hong Kong to repackage part of
its residential property loan portfolio for sale to investors, when it
announced a HKDollars 1bn offering of mortgage-backed securities.
The bulk of the issue has already been placed with institutional investors
in Europe, Hong Kong, China and Japan, said Mr Timothy Kelly, head of Hong
Kong retail banking. The issue is expected to be completed by July 27.
The mortgages will be purchased from Citibank by Homes-1, which will finance
the purchase through the issue of HKDollars 1bn in securities. Homes-1 will
issue three tranches of securities.
Mr Kelly said the HKDollars 1bn of mortgages represented a small percentage
of the bank's portfolio, but it gave the bank another tool with which better
to manage its balance sheet, liquidity, and funding of assets.
Goldman Sachs (Asia) and Citicorp International are joint lead managers.
