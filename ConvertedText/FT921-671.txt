FT  27 MAR 92 / Council spending uncut during Thatcher years, says
researcher


   By ANDREW ADONIS


THIRTEEN YEARS after the election of the Thatcher government, local
authorities have survived unscathed with their spending largely uncut and
their workforces only marginally reduced, according to a study published
today.
Mr Tony Travers, a research director at the London School of Economics, says
council expenditure has risen as a proportion of all UK public expenditure
since 1979 - from 23.5 per cent to 23.8 per cent.
That is in spite of repeated attempts by the government to restrain the
spending of councils by the use of capping and other devices.
'Local spending has remained remarkably constant in the years since 1979,'
he says in today's Local Government Chronicle.
Since 1979, current spending has risen from Pounds 36bn to Pounds 49bn at
1990 prices, while capital spending has hovered between Pounds 8bn and
Pounds 11bn.
Local-authority manpower has fallen only from 2.4m to 2.3m since 1979, Mr
Travers says. Numbers fell in the early 1980s, but rose steadily from 1983
until 1988.
Since 1988, the workforce has fallen by at least 100,000, almost all through
compulsory competitive tendering of council services.
The Conservative manifesto for the election proposes the continuation of
such efforts.
Labour and the Liberal Democrats, by contrast, are promising to end capping,
to give a significant boost to local-authority capital spending, and to give
councils a general power of competence to take on new responsi-bilities.
