FT  01 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Facing the unpleasant auditing
decisions


   From Mr ROGER DAVIS


Sir, In response to my plea (Accountancy Column, August 19) for auditors not
to seek refuge in rule books, the chairman of the United States Financial
Accounting Standards Board is right to say that accounting standards and
professional judgment should be equal partners ('Balancing rules and
professional judgment', October 14).
My concern is that they could become very unequal. Mr Beresford identifies
correctly the tendency for business people and auditing firms to ask for
more accounting rules so as to avoid having to make difficult judgments
themselves. Major business decisions are inevitably influenced by accounting
standards and it is vital not to create an unnecessary accounting
straitjacket on company directors.
I agree with Mr Beresford that there is more to be done through accounting
standards to ensure comparability of accounts. His example of merger and
acquisition accounting - and how you account (or don't account) for goodwill
 -is a case in point in the UK.
But his other example of accounting for foreign currency hedges illustrates
my point. To achieve accounting certainty, the standard setters have
traditionally associated them with the balance sheet rather than with their
real purpose of protecting future cash flow, which requires more judgment.
It is that kind of conflict between accounting definition and commercial
reality which we need to avoid.
I repeat my request for business and the auditing profession to take more of
the unpleasant decisions for themselves. In the long run this will be good
for industry and good for the profession, and it will make life easier for
Mr Beresford and his fellow standard setters.

head of audit,
