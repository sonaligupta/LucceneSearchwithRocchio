FT  30 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Czech telecoms loan


   By ANDREW ADONIS and AP


THE European Investment Bank yesterday announced an Ecu65m (Pounds 52m) loan
to the Czech Republic to help modernise its telecommunications system.
The loan, which is to help finance projects to provide 500,000 new lines and
modernise existing infrastructure, brings to nearly Ecu330m the funds
committed by the EIB for the upgrading of telecommunications systems in
central and eastern Europe. The 15-year loan will finance nearly one-tenth
of the required expenditure.
The telecoms loan accounts for more than half of the EIB's lending to the
Czech Republic.
AP adds: The EIB yesterday said it would loan Dollars 230m to help fund the
first stage of a high-capacity, natural-gas line linking Algerian supplies
with the Spanish gas network and eventually EC countries.
