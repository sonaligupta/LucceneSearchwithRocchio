FT  22 JUL 94 / Court jails banker in Indonesia

   JAKARTA


An Indonesian court sentenced a former bank manager to nine years in prison
yesterday in a loan fraud case that has cost a state bank more than Dollars
448m (Pounds 290m), AP reports from Jakarta.
Meanwhile, the prosecution demanded life imprisonment for the Chinese
businessman whose company took out the loan from the state-owned Bank
Pembangunan Indonesia.
Questions have also been raised about the roles of senior officials
including President Suharto's chief adviser, but they are not on trial.
Mr Maman Suparman, 48, former manager of the bank's South Jakarta branch,
was found guilty of receiving a 256m rupiah (Pounds 75,800) bribe from
businessman Mr Eddy Tanzil and illegally converting documents to help him
obtain the loan and use it improperly.
The South Jakarta District Court also fined Mr Suparman 15m rupiahs and
ordered that his house and land be confiscated.
His lawyers said they would appeal. 'There was no evidence found during the
trial that Suparman has received bribery in connection with the loan,' said
Mr Danny Kaliamang, who led a six-member defence team.
