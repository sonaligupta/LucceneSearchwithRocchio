FT  04 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow bides its time in advance
of jobs data

Wall Street
AMID uncertainty about the outlook for share prices, US stock markets traded
in a narrow range yesterday as investors nervously awaited tomorrow's
important May jobs data, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 10.89 at 3,406.99. The
index would have ended higher but for a late sell-off in the final minutes
which lopped almost 15 points off the Dow. The more broadly based Standard &
Poor's 500 finished up 1.08 at 414.58, the Amex composite up 1.70 at 395.65,
and the Nasdaq composite up 0.75 at 589.93. Turnover on the NYSE was 216m
shares.
After breaking through the 3,400 barrier on the Dow at the start of the
week, investors were disappointed that the market did not add to those gains
on Tuesday. Analysts said that the failure of shares to advance further
suggested that, until there is fresh evidence of economic strength or
improved corporate profitability, stock markets were unlikely to gain much
more ground in the short term.
Among individual stocks, General Motors rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 41 3/4
in heavy trading after the carmaker said that, as part of its cost-cutting
drive, it would open to fresh bids virtually all of its contracts with
suppliers. The other two big car stocks were also firmer, with Ford up
Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 46 3/4 and Chrysler Dollars  1/2 higher at Dollars
19 7/8 .
McDonnell Douglas fell Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 39 1/8 on reports that over
the past few trading days a major institutional shareholder was looking
either to trim its holdings or to move out of the stock altogether.
Drug stocks, which took a hammering on Tuesday in the wake of a profits
warning from Bristol Myers Squibb, were mixed. Bristol Myers eased Dollars
1/8 to Dollars 66 3/8 , Merck held steady at Dollars 49 5/8 , Pfizer added
Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 71 3/4 , Upjohn fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 33 1/2
, Glaxo was unchanged at Dollars 27 1/4 , as was Schering-Plough, at Dollars
50 5/8 .
On the Nasdaq market, Borland International fell Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 49
3/8 in heavy trading after analysts at two broking houses, Donaldson, Lufkin
& Jenrette and Goldman Sachs, lowered their earnings estimates for the
company's first fiscal quarter ending this month.
Both said that they had changed their estimates because they were not sure
whether Borland's new Paradox 4.0 product would reach retailers during the
current quarter.
Advanced Telecommunications, which revealed on Tuesday that it was in merger
talks, jumped Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 22 1/2 in 4m shares after the company
entered a stock swap merger pact with LDDS Communications, down Dollars 2
3/8 at Dollars 29 1/4 .
Egghead Software fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 20 1/4 in busy trading on
news of fiscal fourth quarter profits that were slightly lower than a year
ago.
Durr-Fillauer rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 22 after it was announced that
Cardinal Distribution will acquire the company's wholesale drug unit for
Dollars 166.5m in stock. Cardinal rose Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 29 3/4 on
the news.
Canada
TORONTO stocks closed about where they started, in active trading. Based on
preliminary data, the TSE 300 was off 2.86 points, or 0.08 per cent, to
3,407.34. Advancing issues were ahead of declines 285 to 248, volume rose to
30.6m shares from the previous 25.8m, and trading value of CDollars 374.6m
was above Tuesday's CDollars 327.5m.
Among the sub-indices, nine were higher and five lower. The day's biggest
gain was recorded by the mining group, up 1.11 per cent on index.
