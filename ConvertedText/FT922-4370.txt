FT  05 JUN 92 / Vosper Thornycroft clinches Pounds 200m deal


   By DAVID WHITE


QATAR HAS ordered four high-speed attack vessels from the UK's Vosper
Thornycroft shipyard in a deal estimated by naval experts to be worth about
Pounds 200m.
No details were given about planned armaments, but the 56-metre warships are
designed to carry surface-to-surface missiles. Qatar currently has three
French patrol vessels armed with Exocet missiles.
The order is a breakthrough in a state that was previously regarded as a
captive market for French defence suppliers.
The Southampton-based yard said it would need to start expanding its
workforce next year to cope with a doubling of its order book to some Pounds
700m. The yard is in the midst of a redundancy programme affecting 350 of
its 2,000 employees.
For the first time for a decade, British shipyards have more than 1m gross
tonnes of vessels either under construction or on order, Lloyd's Register
said yesterday. The total is 1,035,512 gross tonnes.
