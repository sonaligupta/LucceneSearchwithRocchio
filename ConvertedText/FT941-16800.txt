FT  07 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: India seen making heavy sugar
imports


   By REUTER


   BOMBAY


India will have to import up to 500,000 tonnes of sugar in 1993-94 to meet
its growing consumption, according to the Centre for Monitoring the Indian
Economy, reports Reuter from Bombay.
CMIE, a privately-funded research body, estimated the season's opening sugar
stock at 3.3m tonnes and production at 11.5m tonnes, against a domestic
consumption of 12.2m.
'However, about 500,000 tonnes of sugar would have to be imported during the
year to maintain a healthy year-end stock level,' the centre said.
It suggested that the government might also allow more imports of raw sugar
for refining and re-export. The commerce ministry had allowed an import of
50,000 tonnes of raw sugar last month for re-export after refining.
'More imports may be allowed after evaluating the impact of the initial flow
in the domestic markets,' CMIE said.
The government had agreed to imports of raw sugar after the sugar industry
suggested the idea to maintain its presence in the market, where prices had
been on the rise. According to the CMIE, domestic sugar prices in December
were 7 per cent higher than in November and 37 per cent higher than in
December 1992. But sugar industry oficials said the Indian Sugar Industry
Export Corporation, the private sector agency authorised to import raw
sugar, had not bought any because of high international prices.
'At the moment we have not gone for any purchases. We have not applied our
mind to the proposal,' said Mr SL Jain of the Indian Sugar Mills'
Association. 'The present international price situation of raw sugar and
white sugar is not compatible with the government policy on value addition.'
