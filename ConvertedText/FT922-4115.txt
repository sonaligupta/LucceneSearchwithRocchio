FT  06 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow recovers after losses on
jobs data


   By PATRICK HARVERSON


   NEW YORK


Wall Street
SHARE PRICES fell in early trading yesterday as investors reacted to a
disappointing May employment report, but a late recovery saw almost all of
the initial losses recouped by the close, writes Patrick Harverson in New
York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down just 1.04 at
3,398.69, compared to its lows for the day when the index had been down more
than 20 points. The more broadly based Standard & Poor's 500 ended up 0.21
at 413.47, while the Nasdaq composite fell 2.83 to 585.43. Turnover on the
NYSE was 199m shares. The May employment figures provided an unexpected
shock - a smaller-than-expected 68,000 jump in non-farm payroll jobs and a
rise in the unemployment rate from 7.3 per cent to 7.5 per cent.
Although the Labor Department said that the increase was primarily due to a
rise in the number of people registering to look for work, the market had
not been expecting any change in the headline rate, and share prices went
into an immediate decline.
The good news was the reaction of the bond market to the jobs figures, which
led to higher bond prices, and lower yields, as hopes rose that the poor
state of the labour market would persuade the Federal Reserve to cut
interest rates again.
Among individual stocks, Reebok International plunged Dollars 4 3/8 to
Dollars 23 1/2 in turnover of 3.6m shares after the sportshoe manufacturer
announced late on Thursday that its second quarter net income would fall to
a range of 49 to 53 cents a share, from 64 cents a share in the same quarter
of 1991.
Du Pont eased Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 51 3/8 in active trading after the
company disclosed it would take a charge in the second quarter to cover
product recall costs. The stock was also damaged by a cut in its earnings
estimates by Salomon Brothers.
Walt Disney fell Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 36 1/2 in turnover of 3m shares as
investors continued to react negatively to news from Euro Disney, the theme
park near Paris half-owned by the US entertainment group.
Although the latest attendance figures were not disappointing, Euro Disney
announced that the opening of a second park would be put back a year and
that the company might not make a profit in its first year.
Albany International dropped Dollars 2 to Dollars 15 1/8 on the news that
company expects to break even, or possibly record a slight loss in the
second quarter because of a 7 per cent decline in sales.
First Chicago firmed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 34 in turnover of 2.8m after a
public offering of 8m shares of the bank's common stock was completed
successfully at a price of Dollars 32.75 a share.
Canada
TORONTO closed lower in moderate trading. The composite index fell 10.86
points to 3,392.56. For the week, the index rose about 4.5 points. Advances
led declines 276 to 260. Volume was 23.9m shares and trading value was
CDollars 269.1m against CDollars 325.6m.
