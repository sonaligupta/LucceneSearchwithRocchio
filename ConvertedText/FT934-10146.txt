FT  06 NOV 93 / How to Spend It: The V & A Treasury Catalogue


The V & A Treasury Catalogue, Freepost 361, Dep 5316, Hendon Road,
Sunderland SR 9AD. Tel: 091-514 2999. Catalogue free.
Here we have another catalogue for those who love the old, the traditional,
the nostalgic. Almost everything has been inspired by designs in the
Museum's collection so it tends to verge on the pretty and the feminine with
little to offer the modern-minded man. However, if this sort of thing is
your cup of tea, there is masses to choose from. There is a wide range of
jewellery - from some dramatic Elizabethan brooches (a couple of toros in
decorative Elizabethan dress with pearls for faces, Pounds 75), rope-edged
pearl earrings (Pounds 29.95), Victorian thimble brooch (Pounds 35) and
charm bracelet (Pounds 65) to a fresh water pearl and mineral necklace
(Pounds 99). There is a Victorian sampler to sew (Pounds 39.95) and a plain
wooden solitaire board with deep-blue marbles (Pounds 19.95). Photographed
above is a pure silk cushion cover with a screenprinted design of a Thai
elephant (Pounds 39.95) including the cushion pad. Look out, too, for an
enchanting selection of old-fashioned children's toys - teddy bears, sets of
traditional games, acrobat sticks and giant floor puzzles.
