FT  12 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Vivat improves to Pounds 3.43m


Vivat Holdings, the maker of jeans and casual wear, mainly under the Lee
Cooper brand name, lifted pre-tax profits to Pounds 3.43m in the year to
December 31 1993, against a restated Pounds 1.95m.
Turnover improved to Pounds 71.2m (Pounds 67.6m), influenced by favourable
currency movements, and generated operating profits of Pounds 5.42m (Pounds
4.36m).
A saving in overheads which resulted from the closure of the group's German
business, together with a significant reduction of bad debts in Spain,
compensated for the cost of restructuring the French sales force and an
increase in marketing expenditure, the company said.
However, with difficult trading conditions in its principal markets, the
company had a long way to go to match the profit levels of the early 1980s.
The proposed single dividend is raised to 1.25p (1p), payable from earnings
of 3.5p (2p).
