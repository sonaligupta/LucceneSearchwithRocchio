1.04bn in second term

   NEW YORK


AMERICAN Telephone & Telegraph, the US communications and computer group,
yesterday reported an 8.6 per cent rise in second-quarter net income while
MCI Communications, its chief long-distance rival, reported flat net income
after an extraordinary charge.
AT&T had net income of Dollars 1.04bn, or 77 cents a share, on revenues of
Dollars 16.3bn, compared with Dollars 961m, or 72 cents, on revenues of
Dollars 15.8bn in the same period of last year.
MCI, in which British Telecom is planning to take a 20 per cent stake,
reported net income of Dollars 150m, or 27 cents, on revenues of Dollars
2.93bn, against income of Dollars 149m, or 26 cents, on revenues of Dollars
2.61bn.
However, MCI's net figure included a Dollars 28m extraordinary charge for
the early retirement of debt. Without that, income rose 19 per cent to
Dollars 178m, while earnings per share were 23 per cent ahead at 32 cents.
AT&T, which announced a big management shake-up yesterday, said its core
long-distance telecommunications services business saw calling volume grow
more than 5 per cent. However, revenues in this business were flat with a
year ago because customers chose lower priced services and adjustments to
revenue estimates for earlier periods.
Products and systems, which encompass its manufacturing operations, saw a
Dollars 166m rise in revenues at network communications products, led by
switching and cable systems, with most of the increase coming from sales to
US telephone companies.
NCR, its computer business, suffered a drop in operating income to Dollars
27m from Dollars 98m because of pricing pressure throughout the industry and
higher sales of lower-margin products.
The group's financial services revenue rose nearly 39 per cent, led by its
Universal credit card. Costs grew by only Dollars 70m, resulting in 'solid
margin improvements in all major service and product categories'.
For the six months, AT&T reported net income of Dollars 2.04bn, or Dollars
1.51, excluding accounting changes, compared with Dollars 1.84bn, or Dollars
1.39, last year.
MCI, which has been eating away at AT&T's long distance market share, said
its traffic increased by 13 per cent in the quarter.
For the six months, MCI reported net income of Dollars 301m, or 55 cents,
after Dollars 45m of extraordinary items, against Dollars 290m, or 52 cents,
in the same period of 1992.
