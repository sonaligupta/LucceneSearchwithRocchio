FT  23 APR 93 / UK Company News: Wm Low ahead as margins improve - Despite
24% rise, shares fall 17p on worries about competition from discount stores


   By ANGUS FOSTER


WM LOW, the Dundee-based food retailer, yesterday announced a sharp rise in
interim profits and said it had restored its margins from the disappointing
levels of a year ago.
Pre-tax profits increased 24 per cent, from Pounds 8.82m to Pounds 10.9m, in
the 28 weeks to March 20.
The increase reversed the first half decline last year, which was blamed on
lower gross margins and rising branch costs.
Despite the increase, the shares fell 17p to 209p on worries about
competition from discount stores and rising costs. Mr Philip Spicer, who
took over as chief executive last year, said both fears had been overdone.
'Competition is competition, but you've got to fight it. Our stores are
trading extremely well,' he said.
Turnover increased by 8.4 per cent to Pounds 240m. Most of the increase was
due to new store openings, although like-for-like sales increased by 1.5 per
cent.
Operating profits improved 31 per cent to Pounds 11.6m, raising operating
margins nearly 1 percentage point to 4.8 per cent.
Capital expenditure was Pounds 19m and is expected to total Pounds 41m
(Pounds 44.3m) for the full year.
Net borrowings at the period end stood at Pounds 52.9m, compared with the
year end figure of Pounds 37.9m. Mr Spicer said that, with the company's
expenditure programme peaking this year, gearing would end the year at its
present level of 33 per cent.
Some Pounds 1.39m of interest costs on property developments were
capitalised.
Fully diluted earnings increased by 19.7 per cent to 12.01p (10.03p) per
share.
However, the interim dividend is unchanged at 2.7p.
COMMENT
After last year's damaging interim performance, Wm Low must have hoped
yesterday's figures would silence its sceptics. The share price fall
suggests otherwise, and there are now fears for the second half outlook for
margins. Some of the worries - the impact of discount retailers, for example
 -may have been overdone. But Wm Low's older stores remain vulnerable and,
with companies like Sainsbury and Kwik Save expanding in Scotland, the stock
market has plenty to twitch about in the longer term. Full year profits of
Pounds 22.5m put the shares on a multiple of 8, a discount to the sector.
Although yesterday's selling may have been excessive, concerns about the
company's size and store portfolio will keep a lid on its rating.
