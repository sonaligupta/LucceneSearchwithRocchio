FT  28 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading


POLITICAL worries returned to the futures market yesterday, sidelining
investors and undermining prices, writes Christopher Price.
The March FT-SE contract opened at 2,458 and, in an early rally, hit the
day's high of day of 2,462. It then proceeded to drift for the rest of the
day, led by the cash market and undermined by reports of a favourable
opinion poll for the Labour party in London marginal constituencies.
A weak Wall Street also dragged at sentiment, and by early afternoon March
was trading at 2,450. Any attempt to trade at a premium to the cash market
was quickly quashed as March was sold down, typically trading at a 4 to
5-point discount.
March closed at 2,444, a fall of 22 on the previous session and a discount
to the cash market of around 4 points. Volume was a quiet 5,797 contracts,
although there was a surge in after-hours trading, with March continuing to
be sold down.
On the traded options market, trading was quiet with 23,090 lots dealt
against 28,000 on the previous day. Business was enlivened by brisk trade in
Lonrho and BTR.
