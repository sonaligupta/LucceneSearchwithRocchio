FT  16 JUN 93 / Slower US inflation eases fears over interest rates


   By MICHAEL PROWSE


   WASHINGTON


US CONSUMER prices rose by 0.1 per cent last month, and by 3.2 per cent in
the year to May, providing further evidence that inflationary pressures are
moderating, the Labour Department reported yesterday.
Following last week's report that wholesale prices were flat last month, the
figures all but eliminated residual fears on Wall Street that the Federal
Reserve might opt for an early increase in interest rates.
Also, the Commerce Department reported the US current account deficit
declined to Dollars 20.9bn (Pounds 13.5bn) in the first quarter, compared
with Dollars 23.7bn in the final period of last year.
The improvement - which occurred in spite of a rise in the merchandise trade
deficit - mainly reflected an increased surplus on services and a rise in
net investment income.
Most analysts are predicting relatively subdued inflation figures throughout
the summer, reflecting an unwinding of distortions which had pushed up the
indices earlier this year.
If the figures remain encouraging, the Fed is unlikely to tighten monetary
policy before the autumn, in spite of its reported shift to a bias towards
raising interest rates.
Compared with April's 0.4 per cent increase, the small overall rise in
consumer prices masked big sectoral differences. Prices of energy and
clothing dropped 1 per cent and 0.5 per cent respectively between April and
May. But prices of many services rose sharply, with medical prices up 0.8
per cent following a 0.6 per cent gain in April.
The 'core' consumer price index, which excludes the volatile components of
food and energy, rose 0.2 per cent last month and by 3.4 per cent in the
year to May.
