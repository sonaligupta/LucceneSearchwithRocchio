FT  13 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Sterling in poll position


   FT-SE Index: 2,493.3 (


29.1)
The more time investors spend analysing the forthcoming UK election, the
more nervous they seem to become. Hence the renewed fall in UK equities
yesterday, although the low trading volume suggests dealers were also
lowering prices to put off would-be sellers. Perhaps more worrying was
sterling's weakness. The dollar was partly to blame after more evidence of
US recovery, but sellers of the UK currency were pushing against an open
door. In trading after official hours, sterling dropped below DM2.86 and
went through its ERM floor against the peseta.
The latter level will doubtless be quickly regained this morning. But after
yesterday's poor inflation figures in Spain, the authorities there are
unlikely to help by cutting interest rates. The question is where that
leaves the UK government if the downward pressure gathers force.
It would be political suicide to raise interest rates, so the government has
to hope that its commitment to the ERM will be enough to deter speculative
excess. The risks of selling short grow larger and the scope for profit
smaller as the currency moves closer to its absolute floor. But, with
sterling still 8 pfennigs above its lower limit against the D-Mark, there is
some leeway. Depending on reaction to the first batch of opinion polls, the
speculators might have a go anyway.
