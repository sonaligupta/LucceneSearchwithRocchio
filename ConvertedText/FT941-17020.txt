Treasury futures


   By LAURIE MORSE

The Chicago Board of Trade will tomorrow launch its answer to
over-the-counter interest rate swaps, offering flexible options on its
active 30-year US Treasury bond futures and 10, five- and two-year Treasury
note futures, writes Laurie Morse in Chicago.
The options allow traders to select expiration date, European or US
expiration styles, and strike price.
The CBoT traded more than 30m standardised options contracts on its Treasury
bond and note futures contracts last year. The new options, which have a
face value of Dollars 2m at maturity, are aimed at institutional investors
seeking a low-cost alternative to swaps.
