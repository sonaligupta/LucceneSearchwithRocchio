FT  30 OCT 93 / International Company News: Nissan passes payout as sales
slide

NISSAN Motor, the Japanese carmaker, yesterday unveiled a drop in first-half
sales and deeper pre-tax and operating losses. The result confirmed fears of
a deteriorating business climate for Japan's automotive industry.
The second-largest Japanese carmaker passed its interim dividend and warned
it would not make a profit in the year to March. The group is undergoing a
restructuring programme and hopes to cut 5,000 jobs over the next three
years.
Although Nissan is uncertain of when it will be able to return to the black,
it is sticking to an earlier forecast of a break-even in the current year,
and a return to profits in fiscal 1994.
However, Mr Heiichi Hamaoka, an executive managing director, conceded 'it is
becoming extremely difficult to attain that goal'.
'Whether or not we can return to profitability next fiscal year depends
largely on the speed of recovery in domestic demand,' he said.
The Japanese carmaker saw a 10 per cent decrease in total vehicle sales over
the period. Much of this was due to the shift of production overseas.
Domestic vehicle production fell 13 per cent, while overseas production rose
22 per cent.
However, the rise of the yen was also a significant reason for the decline
in vehicle sales. Nissan said during the first half, the impact of the yen's
rise amounted to Y100bn (Dollars 926m).
Although about Y50bn was absorbed through forward exchange dealing and price
rises, the net impact of the currency's surge was Y50bn.
Nissan has tried to combat the adverse affects of the yen and weak sales
through cost-cutting, which resulted in savings of about Y60bn.
It has, however, also been able to make non-operating income of Y13.2bn from
sales of marketable securities.
Nissan's European operations are also under heavy pressure. The European
market's weakness meant production at the UK plant would have to be reduced
by about 9 per cent from 270,000 units to 246,000 units. The company was
studying ways to reduce production without laying off people, Mr Hamaoka
said.
'It is a very abnormal situation,' he said.
Nissan is expecting to suffer an operating loss in the second half. This
could force it to consider selling securities and fixed assets to break even
at the pre-tax level.
