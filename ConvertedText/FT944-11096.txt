FT  08 NOV 94 / Business and the Law: US association for corporate lawyers
comes to Brussels - Legal Briefs


The American Corporate Counsel Association, which represents lawyers working
in commerce and industry, is to open a European office in Brussels.
The move reflects the growth in numbers of in-house lawyers in Europe,
particularly in US companies. From its Washington DC headquarters, the
association has built a membership of 9,600 in 10 years and developed a
mainly educational role.
The association will use the Brussels office to pass information to members
and will also develop specific European projects such as the preparation of
a database on specialists working in European law firms.
Its first European conference will be in Paris on November 21 and 22.
Subjects for discussion include corporate attorney-client relationships;
organisation and development of in-house legal departments; and a session on
the changing legal environment for mergers and acquisitions in central and
eastern Europe. Further information from Michel Cloes in Brussels on 32 (53)
762 800 or by fax on Brussels 643 1458.
