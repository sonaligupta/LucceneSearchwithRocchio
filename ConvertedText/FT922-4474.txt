FT  05 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Whitbread pub lease to Brent Walker


   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE


Whitbread, the brewing and retailing group, is to lease 174 pubs, free of
tied beer supplies, to Brent Walker's Pubmaster estate, writes Philip
Rawstorne.
The deal increases the Pubmaster estate to nearly 2,000 pubs and leaves
Whitbread with only another 550 pubs to free from the tie in the next five
months to comply with the government's beer orders.
Whitbread has sold more than 1,000 pubs and leased a further 800 in the past
three years. The pubs leased to Pubmaster are mainly in north-west England,
Gloucestershire, and Kent.
