FT  08 NOV 94 / International Company News: Brierley lifts NZ media stake to
29%, ends offer


   By TERRY HALL


Brierley Investments, the New Zealand hotels and investments group,
yesterday said it had acquired a 29 per cent stake in Wilson & Horton and
was therefore withdrawing its offer to buy shares in the publishing company.
The Horton family, meanwhile, which until last Friday was the controlling
shareholder in New Zealand's biggest newspaper, said it was 'shell-shocked'
by Brierley's raid, in which it bought shares at NZDollars 9.50 each.
The Horton and Wilson families have controlled the publisher since 1863. The
company owns the country's biggest daily, the Auckland-based New Zealand
Herald, provincial and weekly papers, magazines and a printing business.
In a lightning raid on Thursday Brierley gained 20 per cent from
institutions, then bought a further 5 per cent, before offering the same
terms to smaller investors. It completed its purchases yesterday.
Mr Michael Horton, the publisher's managing director, had advised
shareholders not to sell, as he was 'quite frankly appalled' by the Brierley
move. He said that a previous move by Brierley into the media business had
been a blow to the industry, reducing the number of large New Zealand
publishing groups from three to two.
Brierley controlled New Zealand Newspapers during the 1980s, but had been
forced to break it up following the 1987 market crash.
Mr Horton's son Matthew, a journalist in Australia who has been acting as
family spokesman, said Brierley was seeking two board seats.
Wilson & Horton shares closed unchanged yesterday at NZDollars 9.50, while
Brierley slipped 1 cent, to NZDollars 1.27.
