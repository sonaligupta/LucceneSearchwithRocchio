FT  26 OCT 92 / Post Office privatisation 'feasible'


   By ROLAND RUDD


PRIVATISATION of the Post Office is feasible, in spite of earlier fears that
it might jeopardise the nationwide delivery network, Kleinwort Benson, the
government's adviser on the future of the service, has told ministers.
In a progress report for the Department of Trade and Industry, the merchant
bank says a regulated privatised Post Office could continue to deliver
letters to every address in the UK without charging more in rural areas.
It describes Royal Mail, the Post Office's letters division, which last year
made pre-tax profits of Pounds 266m, as a classic candidate for a flotation.
The less profitable Post Office Counters, which handles social security
payments, would be harder to sell separately. Kleinwort believes that in
spite of last year's Pounds 26m pre-tax profits, the division's network is
fundamentally uncommercial. One option is to float it off with Royal Mail.
While the study is only a first draft and contains no recommendations, it is
likely to strengthen the case for privatising the Post Office.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has emphasised the
government's commitment to a nationwide delivery service with a uniform and
affordable structure of prices. He also wants to encourage competition.
Kleinwort's report says those objectives are neither mutually exclusive nor
threatened by privatising the Post Office.
Competition could be encouraged by reducing the Royal Mail's monopoly on
letters costing less than Pounds 1 to a level closer to a first-class stamp
and by opening up its postal network to private couriers.
TNT, the Australian delivery company, and DHL, the international courier,
might seek to carry mail and, in rural areas, pay the Post Office to deliver
their letters on the final leg through Royal Mail.
