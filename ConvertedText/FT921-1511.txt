FT  24 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Single malt lift for Macallan-Glenlivet


   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE


MACALLAN-GLENLIVET, the Scotch whisky distiller, increased pre-tax profits
by 10 per cent, from Pounds 6.69m to Pounds 7.38m, over 1991.
Operating profit rose 19 per cent to Pounds 6.36m (Pounds 5.34m) on turnover
9 per cent higher at Pounds 17.4m (Pounds 15.9m).
Mr Allan Shiach, chairman, said the profit increase came primarily from
growth in sales of the Macallan single malt, which was now achieving
widening international distribution. Sales were particularly buoyant in
Italy.
The deflated world economy led to even more competitive market conditions
and to a lower demand than usual from blending customers.
Commenting on the short-term outlook, Mr Shiach said the effects of
recession at home and abroad were likely to make trading conditions
particularly difficult.
'These conditions have influenced blenders' forecasts and further reduced
demand for new whisky,' he added. 'We expect the current year to reflect
this decline though we also look to growth in sales of the Macallan to help
mitigate its effect.'
Earnings per share improved to 4.95p (4.69p) after conversion of 90 per cent
of the convertible loan stock issued in 1985.
A final of 0.5125p raises the total to 0.7625p (0.61p).
