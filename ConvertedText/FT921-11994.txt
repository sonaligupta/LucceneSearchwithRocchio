SOUTH Korea's city and regional banks' profits increased to Won1,767bn
(Dollars 2.23bn) in fiscal 1991 from Won1,396bn a year earlier, according to
provisional figures released by the Bank of Korea. Reuter reports from
Seoul.
Aggregate profits after tax rose 12.9 per cent to Won796.5bn in 1991 from
Won705.3bn in 1990. Banks' fiscal years mainly correspond to the calendar
year.
South Korea currently has 13 city and 10 regional banks. Hana Bank and Boram
Bank and specialised banks such as Korea Development Bank were excluded from
the list.
'Bank profits have increased as the scale of their business has grown,' the
Bank of Korea said. Total assets of the banks rose 23.5 per cent to
Won138,900bn in 1991 from Won112,500bn in 1990.
Repayment of loans by short-term finance companies contributed to the banks'
improved results. Return on assets fell to 0.57 per cent in 1991 from 0.63
per cent in 1990, while return on equity-capital rose to 7.3 per cent from
6.9 per cent the year before. Reduced overheads were a factor in increased
profits.
Korea First Bank had the largest pre-tax profit - Won216bn compared with
Won163bn in 1990.
Shinhan Bank again recorded the highest profit after tax - Won116bn in 1991
against Won99bn the year before.
