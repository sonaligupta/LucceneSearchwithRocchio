FT  21 DEC 92 / Bush cools hopes for N-treaty


   By REUTER


   WASHINGTON


THE US and Russia have made 'real progress' in talks on additional cuts in
long-range nuclear weapons but are not yet ready to sign a Start-2 treaty,
President George Bush said yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington.
Russian President Boris Yeltsin surprised officials in Washington last week
when he said a Start-2 agreement was in hand and would be signed before Mr
Bush handed over power to President-elect Bill Clinton next month.
'I can tell you it's not agreed totally. We've made some real progress,' Mr
Bush said after holding a telephone conversation with Mr Yeltsin.
He did not elaborate on what progress had been made in negotiations, but US
officials sought to dampen speculation that Mr Bush and Mr Yeltsin might
meet in Alaska to sign an accord early next month.
Start-2 would eliminate all land-based multiple warhead missiles, the most
dangerous in either country's nuclear arsenal, and slash both sides' total
stockpiles of warheads by up to two-thirds.
