FT  30 NOV 94 / International Company News: NEC invests further Y100bn in
D-Rams

NEC, the Japanese electronics group, is to invest Y100bn (Dollars 1.01bn) in
southern Japan to mass-produce 256-megabit dynamic random access memory
chips (D-Rams).
The move, the third substantial semiconductor capital investment by the
company, strengthens NEC's bid to beat the competition in the race to
dominate the market for future generation D-Rams.
In the past three months, NEC has announced an Dollars 800m investment in
Scotland to manufacture 64-megabit D-Rams and a Dollars 50m expansion at its
Roseville plant in the US.
The latest announcement comes as NEC unveiled a new facility built at a cost
of Y950bn at its plant in Kyushu, the southern Japanese island.
The new investment will expand production at Kyushu and is expected to
result in the most advanced facility in the world, which will start
mass-producing 256-megabit D-Rams by 1997.
These memory chips are at the leading edge of semiconductor technology,
which will only become widely used towards the end of the decade.
The new facility will have the capacity to produce 30,000 8-inch diameter
silicon wafers per month at the smallest width of circuitry possible, of
0.25 microns.
NEC's aggressive move into the higher end of the market reflects its need,
which is shared by other Japanese manufacturers, to keep moving on to
advanced technologies to maintain its position in the highly competitive
semiconductor market.
