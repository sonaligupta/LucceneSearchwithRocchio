FT  30 NOV 94 / International Company News: Cash crisis forces Grand Union
into restructuring


   By TONY JACKSON


   NEW YORK


Grand Union, the struggling US supermarket chain, is being forced into
financial restructuring by a cash crisis. The company has long-term debt of
Dollars 1.4bn, mostly in the form of junk bonds.
Grand Union, which was the subject of a Dollars 1.2bn management buy-out
from the Anglo-French financier Sir James Goldsmith six years ago, said cash
from operations would be insufficient to meet interest payments due early
next year.
Mr Gary Hirsch, chairman, said he expected the company to remain in
compliance with its debt agreements until January 15, by which time it would
propose a restructuring plan. Goldman Sachs and BT Securities have been
engaged as advisers.
Mr Hirsch said: 'We intend to move quickly in our discussions with our
debt-holders, but will endorse only a restructuring plan which provides for
continuing full and prompt payment to all of our trade creditors.'
Grand Union, which has sold a number of stores in recent years, still
operates 246 in six states in the north-west. In its second quarter to
October 15, it made profits of Dollars 17.7m before cash interest payments
of Dollars 31.7m.
There was a net loss of Dollars 35.9m against a loss of Dollars 20.2m the
year before, on sales down 1 per cent at Dollars 557m. Same store sales were
down 3.6 per cent.
The company said it was re-examining its capital expenditure programme and
had reduced its forward buy inventory. It said these actions could have an
adverse impact over time, but were necessary to maintain liquidity during
the restructuring process.
