FT  29 JAN 92 / International Company News: Fiat sees earnings setback to
L1,100bn

FIAT, Italy's largest private sector company, is set to suffer another big
setback in net profits, possibly by as much as one-third to around L1,100bn
(Dollars 907m) for 1991.
The figures, derived from a letter sent to shareholders yesterday, suggest
that Fiat will be forced to cut its dividend when the payout is announced in
May.
For 1990, the company caused controversy when it maintained its dividend at
L370 a share for ordinary and preference shares and L400 for savings stock,
despite a marked earnings fall.
The latest drop in profits, which is broadly in line with expectations,
reflects sharply contracting demand for motor vehicles, Fiat's core
business. Earnings have also been squeezed by tighter profit margins and
heavy investments, which have not been compensated by better performance
from non-industrial activities like financial services.
Group sales rose 1.1 per cent to L57,828bn last year, while turnover for
Fiat's core industrial activities dropped to L49,689bn from L49,894bn.
Last year's figures include L2,176bn in sales for Ford New Holland and CEAc,
the newly-acquired farm equipment and components businesses.
However, L1,710bn in sales of Telettra, sold to Alcatel-Alsthom, are
excluded.
The company stressed that its Fiat Auto car business remained in profit
despite a continuing fall in demand. In 1991, the group's share of the
Italian car market, which it once dominated, shrank further to 46.7 per cent
from 52.8 per cent in 1990.
Difficulties on the cars side and the consolidation of loss-making
acquisitions like Ford New Holland and the Enasa trucks group in Spain meant
group operating profits fell to about L636bn last year.
Around L1,000bn of Fiat's 1991 pre-tax profits - estimated to be around
L1,600bn - were derived from extraordinary items. Selling Telettra made
around L700bn, while a further L200bn came from other disposals.
