FT  28 APR 94 / Labour claims procedure war win


    By DAVID OWEN


Labour last night called off its four-month-long procedural war against the
government, clearing the way for normal parliamentary relations to resume
between the two sides, David Owen writes.
Proclaiming victory, the party said that detailed negotiations had produced
a substantial package of government concessions that addressed a number of
Labour grievances.
But government business managers said last night they had 'given nothing
away'.
Under the protest, even non-contentious legislation was opposed and the
practice of pairing was discontinued.
