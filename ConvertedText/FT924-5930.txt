FT  24 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Amber Day chief received Pounds 1.13m
pay-out


   By ANDREW BOLGER


Amber Day has paid Pounds 1.13m in compensation to Mr Philip Green, who
stepped down as the discount retailer's controversial chairman and chief
executive in September.
Amber Day's annual report, published yesterday, also disclosed that Mr
Green, who resigned after the group reported unexpectedly poor results, had
seen his annual salary increase from Pounds 325,000 to Pounds 460,000 in the
year to August 1.
However, Mr Green's pay rise is accounted for by a deferred bonus of Pounds
150,000 for 1990-91.
This year the group's pre-tax profits to August 1 fell from Pounds 10.1m to
Pounds 7.5m - well below the forecast of at least Pounds 10.1m made as
recently as mid-June, when analysts' expectations of Pounds 14m-Pounds 15m
were downgraded.
The profits shortfall was the last straw for the City, which had seen Amber
Day's shares collapse from a peak of 129p last November following a series
of bear raids and newspaper stories about Mr Green's business associates and
commercial deals.
Yesterday's annual report said the board had, in conjunction with the
group's auditors, undertaken a careful review of of transactions initiated
by Mr Green for the period of the accounts and up to his resignation on
September 24.
The board said it was 'satisfied that all these transactions were undertaken
in the commercial interests of the group and is not of the opinion that any
further provisions need to be made.'
Mr David Thomson, temporary chairman and chief executive, said the board was
actively seeking to appoint an independent chairman and at least one
non-executive director as soon as possible.
Amber Day's shares yesterday closed 2p lower at 29p.
