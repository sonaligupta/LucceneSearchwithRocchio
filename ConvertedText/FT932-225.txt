FT  30 JUN 93 / UN and Iraq resume oil export negotiations

   NEW YORK, MOSCOW


HIGH-LEVEL talks between the United Nations and Iraq will begin in New York
on July 7 aimed at resumption of limited Iraqi oil exports, it was announced
last night. The Sec-urity Council agreed in resolutions in August and
September 1991 to ease sanctions so Baghdad could export up to Dollars 1.6bn
(Pounds 1.06bn) worth of oil. About Dollars 1bn of income would be earmarked
for humanitarian needs, with the rest going to pay UN costs since the Gulf
war, including destruction of Iraqi heavy weapons.
Several negotiating rounds between the two sides in New York and Vienna
failed with Iraq saying conditions imposed violated its sovereignty.
Russia has kept up high-level contacts with Iraq and is ready for economic
co-operation 'as soon as sanctions are lifted,' Mr Anatoly Adamishin, deputy
foreign minister, said yesterday, John Lloyd adds from Moscow.
Mr Adamishin, defending his country's support of the US attack on Baghdad
before the Russian parliament, said Moscow and Baghdad had mapped out
'specific future projects' although he declined to discuss them.
Vice-President Alexander Rutskoi echoed MPs' views, saying it was
regrettable that Russia was so swift to approve an action he branded as both
illegal and immoral, without consulting parliament.
