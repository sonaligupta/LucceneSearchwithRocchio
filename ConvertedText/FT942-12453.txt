FT  29 APR 94 / Observer: Nannying


The Securities & Investments Board is in no danger of overestimating the
savoir faire of its supervisory charges.
Before abolishing the two self-regulatory organisations Lautro and Fimbra
when it establishes the dreaded Personal Investment Authority, it is obliged
to listen to representations from all those with a lingering fondness for
the supervisor they know. Two retired judges are hearing submissions, and
the SIB has thoughtfully equipped participants with some 'procedural
guidance'.
'Although the hearings are not intended to have needless formality,' the
blurb runs, 'the appointed persons may be addressed appropriately as
follows: Lord Oliver should be addressed as Lord Oliver and Dame Margaret
Booth should be addressed as Dame Margaret.' You don't say.
