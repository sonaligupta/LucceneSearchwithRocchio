FT  15 APR 94 / UK Company News: Rising provisions leave Aegis Pounds 18m in
the red


   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent


Aegis, the London-based holding company of Europe's largest media-buying and
planning group, incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 18m for the year to
December 31, compared with restated deficit of Pounds 11m.
Exceptional items of Pounds 40m were Pounds 25.9m higher than the Pounds
14.1m the group had been expecting at the time of its refinancing in October
last year.
Some Pounds 9.5m of the exceptionals were for FRS 4 requirements, which
alter the treatment of refinancing costs and preference dividends. The
remainder was made up largely of additional restructuring and a reserve to
cover a fine under French competition law, against which the group is
appealing.
Mr Frank Law, chairman, said the underlying pre-tax profit of Pounds 22m was
at the anticipated level.
The group also confirmed that Mr Michel Lefebvre, chief financial officer,
would be leaving 'in due course' and that Mr Thierry Vial Collet, chief
operating officer, would also be leaving. Mr Charles Hochman, chief
executive, may retire by the end of next year.
Consultants are reviewing the group's central management structure to bring
it into line with the 'enlargement and geographic spread of the shareholders
following the refinancing'.
The current management is strongly French but, following the refinancing,
Omnicom, the US advertising group, has acquired a 9 per cent stake, and
Warburg Pincus, the US investment firm, a 33 per cent holding.
Turnover was down 3 per cent at Pounds 2.75bn, while gross income dropped 19
per cent to Pounds 153m.
Operating expenses were down 14 per cent at Pounds 120m and underlying
operating profit was reduced by 37 per cent to Pounds 33m. Gross margins
dropped from 6.7 per cent to 5.6 per cent.
Losses per share fell from a restated 20.8p to 12.1p. The dividend for the
year is omitted and the board said it did not expect a payment in 1994. An
interim only of 1.375p was paid for 1992.
COMMENT
Aegis is heavily dependent on operations in France where the
recently-introduced 'Loi Sapin' has slashed media-buying revenues. Until
April 1993 media buyers could take a cut from substantial volume-related
discounts from media owners; now all discounts have to be passed on directly
to advertisers. In spite of this, the group has maintained a gross margin of
5.6 per cent, compared with the pre-Loi Sapin level of 6.7 per cent. Growth
in turnover is anticipated by the company, with over a dozen new clients
coming on stream during 1994. Forecast profits of Pounds 30m put the shares
on a prospective multiple of 11.8. That sizeable discount to the market is
understandable, given recent traumas, but does not yet reflect the recovery
potential.
