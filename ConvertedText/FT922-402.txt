FT  27 JUN 92 / Smith and Gould clash during leadership debate


   By ALISON SMITH


THE TWO contenders for the Labour leadership clashed last night after the
decision this week by the party's national executive committee to postpone
the introduction of a one-member, one-vote selection system for
parliamentary candidates.
Mr John Smith, the odds-on favourite to become leader next month, insisted
that Labour 'is capable of making the changes that are necessary' to win the
next general election.
The party would move to adopt one member, one vote for candidate selection,
change the system of electing the leader and modernise its relationship with
the unions, he said.
But Mr Bryan Gould, the shadow environment secretary, warned that unless
Labour could shake off its preference for 'old certainties' and set a new
agenda, it ran the risk of losing the next election as well.
He said: 'Unless we can break through this torpor and consciously set out a
convincing, radical prospectus for the voters of 1996, we are in danger of
facing a further defeat.'
In a leadership debate with Mr Gould, Mr Smith said Labour needed to show
its commitment to practical, positive freedoms and to develop a strategy for
'citizenship and community'.
'We must offer a path to personal empowerment by encouraging responsibility
and participation in a democracy in which power is more widely shared,' he
said, in an oblique attack on the more 'consumerist' nature of the
government's Citizen's Charter.
He accused the Tories of trying to present decisions as determined by the
market when they were really about political will - for example, their moves
to introduce market mechanisms to the health service.
The attempt to 'take the politics out of politics' would fail, he said,
because it ignored the power of vested interests and assumed that markets
always worked.
