FT  11 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Competitiveness is not at risk from
strong labour movement


   From Mr ROBERT PHELPS


Sir, Clearly discussion of the merits of a social clause in international
trade is hotting up. But the assumption that a country's competitive edge in
world trade is necessarily sharpened by the absence of a strong labour
movement can be questioned.
In an economy where labour is repressed, unskilled labour is likely to be
repressed the most. The result, since manufacturing workers are usually more
skilled than those in most services, is to discourage the production of
tradeable goods. Service-sector output expands, compared with an economy
with market-determined wages, as intra-marginal profits are the higher. As
service-sector output expands relatively, its price falls relatively. An
effective revaluation of the currency results and competitiveness is lost.
In such an economy, the development of a strong union movement would ideally
raise the relative level of unskilled wages, correcting the tradeable,
non-tradeable imbalance and bringing an effective devaluation to retrieve
competitiveness. If this is correct, the International Confederation of Free
Trade Unions is being far from protectionist ('A bid to push the world to
rights', April 5) in seeking global acceptance of workers' rights. Setting
further barriers to expansion of exports from an uncompetitive economy may
be the wrong way to proceed.
