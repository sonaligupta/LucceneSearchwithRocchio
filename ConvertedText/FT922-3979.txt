FT  09 JUN 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (6): Does a deficit really
matter? - Finance


   By PETER MARSH


BALANCE OF PAYMENTS THEORY AND THE UK EXPERIENCE by A P Thirlwall and
Heather Gibson Macmillan Pounds 17.50, 437 pages
IT IS time to welcome back an old favourite: does it matter if Britain has a
big current account deficit? With public sector finances ballooning into
debt and with imports likely to expand faster than exports, the next few
years will see much discussion over Britain's ability to 'pay its way' in
the world.
This book provides useful arguments as to whether we should worry about
this, or whether to treat the deficits as purely a problem for academic
economists. Thirlwall is firmly in the 'deficits do matter' camp. With his
co-author he has updated a book which first appeared in 1980 and is now in
its fourth edition. The additional material since the previous imprint in
1986 adds much to the debate about the directions for manufacturing industry
in the UK, the impact of entry into the ERM, and the degree to which
government policies can influence economic performance.
Although much of the volume is technical, the lay reader will find useful
some of the detailed discussion about economic theory. There is also a handy
table of Britain's balance of payments going back to the 19th century, as
well as an explanation of such terms as crawling exchange rates.
