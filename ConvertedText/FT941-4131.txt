FT  12 MAR 94 / International Company News: ABN Amro to lift dividend by 5%


   By RONALD VAN DE KROL


   AMSTERDAM


ABN Amro, the Netherlands' largest bank, is to raise its 1993 dividend by
slightly more than 5 per cent, after posting a 20 per cent increase in net
profit last year.
Net profit rose to Fl 2.02bn (Dollars 1.05bn) from Fl 1.68bn in 1992, with
European operations contributing by far the largest percentage increase in
growth. The dividend is to be raised to Fl 3.05 per share from Fl 2.90.
Mr Robert Hazelhoff, chairman, said results improved across the board last
year. '(But) the icing on the cake was the exceptional year for equities,'
he said.
Total revenue rose 13.4 per cent to Fl 14.1bn, outstripping the 10.8 per
cent increase in total costs, to Fl 10.9bn.
Pre-tax operating results in Europe surged almost three-fold, to Fl 442m
from Fl 117m. This easily surpassed the 12.3 per cent increase in ABN Amro's
home market. However, the bank's Dutch business is far larger in absolute
terms, accounting for Fl 1.97bn out of the group's total operating profits
of Fl 3.17bn.
In the US, the bank's second most important market, pre-tax operating profit
rose only 0.4 per cent to Fl 532m. This limited rise was due to provisions,
already reported at mid-year, to cover risks in debt securities. Without the
item, US profits would have been up nearly 24 per cent.
Overall, foreign operations posted a combined 47.7 per cent increase in
operating profit.
Mr Hazelhoff said ABN Amro was reaping the rewards of acquisitions of
European stockbrokers.
