FT  27 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Reorganisation at London Electricity


   By ROLAND RUDD


LONDON ELECTRICITY yesterday announced its biggest reorganisation since it
came to the market two and half years ago.
The regional electricity company has established three divisions to refocus
its business in the run-up to 1994, when the market will be open to greater
competit - ion.
Network services is taking over the regulated distribution activities,
including the restructured electrical contracting business and the operation
of the airport distribution systems acquired from BAA earlier this year.
Customer services will be responsible for the regulated supply of
electricity.
Energy services will concentrate on the competitive market of bulk
electricity trading, including pooling and settlement operations.
The group's other competitive interests, such as electricity marketing to
customers with demands greater than 100kw and gas marketing through its
joint venture with Total Gas, will also be part of the energy division.
Mr Roger Urwin, chief executive, said: 'This is the next logical move since
we were floated. The reorganisation reflects the change in our business.'
The company has withdrawn from retail operations and restructured its
contracting operations, leading to the loss of 350 jobs.
Mr Mike Brown, responsible for customer services, and Mr Ian Beament, who is
to take charge of network services, will join the board next month.
