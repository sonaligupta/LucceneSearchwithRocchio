FT  12 MAR 94 / Trade gap grows as recovery pulls in more imports: Deficit
fears hit sterling as receding hope of rate cuts depresses shares and bonds


   By EMMA TUCKER and PHILIP COGGAN


Britain's trade gap widened abruptly in December, as the recovering economy
drew in more imports than expected.
Strong import volumes of a broad range of goods, combined with particularly
poor exports to the European Union, increased the visible deficit to Pounds
1.57bn in December from Pounds 1.28bn in November. The Central Statistical
Office said the underlying trend also pointed to a growing visible deficit.
The spectre of a widening trade gap as growth gathers speed put downward
pressure on the pound, which fell almost 1 1/2 pfennigs yesterday to close
in London at DM2.521.
Robust imports in the last quarter of 1993 - underlying volumes were up 3.5
per cent on the previous quarter against a 3 per cent drop in exports -
added to evidence that recovery is well established, reducing hopes of an
early cut in interest rates.
Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, backed up this view in
Washington when he dismissed the need for 'an artificial stimulus' to spur
growth.
This sentiment helped depress gilts and London share prices. The FT-SE 100
index fell 42 to 3,191.9, its lowest close this year, for a loss this week
of 86.1.
Mr George, questioned by reporters after speaking at an international
banking conference in Washington on Thursday, said UK economic growth could
pick up to an annual rate of 3 per cent over the next 18 months. That is a
higher rate than the Treasury's official forecast of 2.5 per cent growth in
gross domestic product in 1994 and the first half of 1995.
Mr Kevin Gardiner, UK economist at Morgan Stanley, said that 'one of the
messages of today's trade data was that the economy was uncomfortably firm
at the end of last year'.
Adding to unease about the UK's tendency to satisfy domestic demand through
imports was the news from the CSO that revisions to EU trade figures for the
first 11 months of 1993 had added an extra Pounds 750m to imports, but only
Pounds 40m to exports.
The CSO warned that the latest figures should be treated with caution, given
the continuing problems of the new system for monitoring intra-EU trade
flows. Many economists suspect that Intrastat - the new method - has
systematically underestimated imports. These revisions appear to confirm
those fears.
For 1993 as a whole, the UK's visible trade deficit was Pounds 13.42bn,
little changed from 1992's Pounds 13.4bn. It was nonetheless Pounds 2bn more
than the government forecast in November's Budget.
The widening of the trade gap in December was wholly due to a sharp
deterioration in trade with the rest of the EU. The deficit widened from a
sharply revised Pounds 543m in November to Pounds 903m.
Mr Richard Needham, trade minister, said the increase in the deficit in
December was not surprising given the continued recession in continental
Europe, the UK's biggest market. Exports to Europe, excluding oil and
erratic items, fell 9.5 per cent in the last quarter of 1993. Imports rose 3
per cent in the period. The Treasury warned against reading too much into
the figures.
