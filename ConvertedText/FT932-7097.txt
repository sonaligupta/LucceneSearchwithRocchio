contracts

BRITAIN has agreed credit lines worth about Dollars 350m (Pounds 227.2m) for
three big Russian refurbishment projects, according to Mr Alexander Shokhin,
Russian deputy prime minister in charge of foreign economic affairs.
He said yesterday that - in talks with Mr Michael Heseltine, president of
the UK board of trade, and other British ministers over the weekend - the
two sides had agreed to proceed on three contracts central to Russian
efforts to upgrade its communications and energy infrastructure.
These are:
Refurbishment of a gas terminal in Siberia, co-financed by Dollars 136m of
UK government and US Export-Import Bank credits and Dollars 74m of credit
guarantees put up by the Russian government. Rolls-Royce will be the leading
UK contractor.
The construction of a new international air terminal at Moscow's Domodyedovo
airport, financed by Dollars 170m in UK credits and Dollars 58m of credit
guarantees from the Russian government. Taylor Woodrow will be the main
contractor.
The project includes development of a new airline based at Domodyedovo
called Air Russia - a joint venture by British Airways and Aeroflot.
The modernisation of Moscow's telephone exchange, financed with Dollars 50m
of UK government credits and Dollars 25m Russian credit guarantees.
Among other projects discussed, said Mr Shokhin, was a plan for a traffic
control system in Moscow.
All the projects chosen are in sectors desperately needing up-grading. The
telephone system in Moscow is plagued by breakdowns, while the international
air terminal at Sheremetyevo cannot meet the growth in traffic.
At Domodyedovo airport, one of the largest domestic terminals badly needs
repairing.
