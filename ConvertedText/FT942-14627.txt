FT  19 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei 225 builds on
gains in a strong Pacific Basin

Active buying of large capital stocks by foreign investors yesterday
outweighed small lot selling by domestic institutions and companies, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 index rose 112.73 to 20,277.36 after a low of 20,222.44 and a
high of 20,494.60. It rose in the morning on index linked buying by
arbitrageurs and purchases by foreign investors, but afternoon profit-taking
eroded some of the gains.
Traders said that investors were turning their attention away from the
political situation, as it seemed likely that Mr Tsutomu Hata, the foreign
minister, would be named prime minister,
Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities said that the Nikkei would move between
20,000 and 21,000. Although the downside was limited, he said, due to buying
by foreign and some domestic institutional investors, companies facing a
high yen would continue to sell into strength.
Volume was 388m shares against 423m. The Topix index of all first section
stocks rose 8.12 to 1,643.24 and the Nikkei 300 gained 1.48 to 300.91.
Advances led declines by 626 to 374 with 174 unchanged and, in London, the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.12 to 1,344.17.
Large capital steels were traded actively. Kawasaki Steel, the most active
issue of the day, rose Y10 to Y385 and Nippon Steel gained Y10 to Y360.
Shipbuilders were also higher, with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries up Y11 to
Y691.
In spite of the rise in the yen against the dollar, blue chip
high-technology stocks were also bought, with Hitachi up Y8 to Y986 and
Toshiba gaining Y10 to Y790.
Construction stocks and nonlife insurance companies, regarded as laggards,
attracted foreign buyers. Obayashi added Y15 to Y697, Kumagai Gumi Y10 to
Y499 and Mitsui Marine and Fire Y18 to Y859.
Oil stocks, firm previously on hopes of a rise in demand due to an economic
rebound, retreated. Teikoku Oil declined Y19 to Y730 and Showa Shell Sekiyu
by Y20 to Y1,410.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 124.76 to 22,599.96 in volume of 24.5m
shares. The index rose for the fourth consecutive day on small lot buying.
