FT  23 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Major promises bill to ease red
tape


   By RALPH ATKINS


MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday promised the early publication of a 'deregulation
bill' - in spite of continuing tensions between cabinet ministers over the
content of the legislative programme in parliament's next session.
The prime minister told the Commons that he hoped proposals for streamlining
official bureaucracy 'will be brought before the House before too long.'
But separately the cabinet postponed an expected discussion on the
legislative programme for the parliamentary session starting in the autumn.
It emerged that the cabinet committee chaired by Mr Tony Newton, leader of
the Commons, has still to decide which bills it proposes to recommend. The
time taken up during the current parliamentary session by the Maastricht
bill has caused a backlog of legislative proposals from Whitehall
departments.
Mr Major wants to present the next session's programme as radical but is
also anxious to avoid unnecessarily splits in the Tory party with
contentious legislation.
Final decisions have still to be taken on whether to include controversial
legislation on equalising male and female state retirement ages, on Sunday
trading and on the de-regulation of London buses.
One casualty has been the Department of Trade and Industry's plans for
privatising the Post Office which has been put off until at least 1994 amid
evidence of Tory disquiet.
Instead the DTI will concentrate on the deregulation initiative headed by
minister Mr Neil Hamilton, and on privatisation of British Coal. Mr Major
said unnecessary regulation and bureaucracy, 'stifles industry and
enterprise,' adding: 'We have to beware of over-implementation of
regulations whether from Whitehall, Brussels, county hall or town hall.'
