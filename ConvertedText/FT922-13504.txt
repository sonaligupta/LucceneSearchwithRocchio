FT  11 APR 92 / Final few Tecs to discuss contracts


   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff


HIGH ON the list of priorities at the Department of Employment next week
will be talks with the 16 Training and Enterprise Councils that have not yet
negotiated contracts for delivering training schemes in 1992-93.
Tecs generally have been concerned about the level of funding of schemes.
One such scheme is Youth Training; another is Employment Training, which is
designed for the adult long-term unemployed.
The negotiations next week will be with the 16 that held out for increased
funding at a time of government cuts in budgets. The Labour party had
promised restitution of cuts. Negotiations were temporarily halted during
the election campaign.
Tecs that have not renegotiated contracts with the government have
temporarily contracted with providers of training.
North London Tec, which encompasses the boroughs of Haringey, Enfield and
Barnet, said its temporary contracts were resulting in a 19 per cent
reduction in the volume of training for the long-term unemployed at a time
when their numbers were increasing in its area.
Nine of the 16 are London Tecs. The biggest single issue facing them is
underfunding, according to an article by Mr Michael Hanson, chief executive
of South Thames Tec.
Writing in special report of the Policy Studies Institute, Mr Hanson said:
'Training in London has been underfunded in the past. No weighting has been
given to meet the inevitable costs in the capital. Additional resources will
be needed if the Tecs are to fulfil the tasks laid upon them.
The combination of low funding and the particular requirements of the London
market, he wrote, had produced a downward spiral of low uptake, poor image
and increasing cost pressure on individual training schemes. 'Establishing a
more realistic level of funding is crucial.'
