FT  13 APR 94 / People: Cotterill to chair Electrocomponents


Sir Keith Bright, 62, non-executive chairman of Electrocomponents, the
electronic, electrical and mechanical distribution group, is retiring from
the company  - but not from active business life  - after the next annual
general meeting, in July. His replacement in that post is Roy Cotterill, 58,
who spent some 25 years with GEC and is currently chairman of Vocalis.
Sir Keith, the former chairman and chief executive of LRT who resigned
following the critical report in the wake of the King's Cross fire, has also
been chairman of Brent Walker for the past 14 months. He has spent eight
years on the board of Electrocomponents, the past five as chairman on a
fixed, five-year contract, the expiry of which coincides with his
retirement. He says that his intention was always to do no more than five
years, which he regards as a 'decent stint' as the chairman of a company.
'The company had gone very wrong and my job when I came here was to change
the strategy and get things right. It had diversified into such things as
computer peripherals and lighting, away from its core businesses. I am
leaving now that things are in much better shape,' says Sir Keith.
In his time with GEC, Cotterill's posts included running the company's Far
East operations from Australia. He is also deputy chairman of Division Group
and a director of Longwall International.
