FT  15 APR 94 / Enterprise fund for Russia


   By JOHN LLOYD


   MOSCOW


A fund to help privatised enterprises in Russia develop their
competitiveness and efficiency was announced yesterday in Moscow. The fund,
approved by the Group of Seven last July, will have an initial capital of
Dollars 100m (Pounds 68m) and loan and other guarantees of Dollars 150m. Mr
Michael Blumenthal, the former US Treasury secretary and chairman of the
Fund for Large Enterprises in Russia, said the fund had already begun
looking for investment opportunities. 'The real process of privatisation has
only just begun - and that is to make the companies focus on becoming
competitive in the market,' he said.
Funds have been provided by USAID, with guarantees from the Overseas Private
Investment Corporation. The fund, to be headed by Mr Austin Beutner, a
former merchant banker, will have its headquarters in Moscow and an office
in New York. Foreign investment is picking up markedly - though from very
low levels. However, political and economic uncertainties have suppressed
rapid growth of foreign enthusiasm.
