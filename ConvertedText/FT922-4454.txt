FT  05 JUN 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report


   By Reuter


Fund buying and short covering in LEAD took the three-month price on the LME
up through Pounds 310 a tonne, triggering buy stops and lifting the market
to a high of Pounds 317 before profit taking pared gains. Traders said there
appeared no fundamental reason for the rise. Prices are expected to drift
back to around Pounds 310 to probe for any follow-up buying to support the
rise. COPPER, after a brief period of consolidation following three-month
metal's recent break from the Dollars 2,230 to Dollars 2,240 a tonne range,
made further gains as Comex began to break through overhead resistance
levels. But a firmer pound against the dollar restrained the sterling price.
Three-month ZINC fluctuated narrowly around Dollars 1,255 a tonne during the
afternoon - a level which some traders said should be providing resistance,
having been broken as a support level on Wednesday. Traders said the driving
force remains the backwardation which ended the day up Dollars 19.50 at
Dollars 170. New York's July raw SUGAR price reached 10.22 cents a lb by
midday on strong fund buying, technical factors and talk of a pick up in
demand for white sugar. London sugar prices took heart from New York's
strength.
