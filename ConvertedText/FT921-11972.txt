FT  29 JAN 92 / Appointments: Hampson quits Fraser


Rodd Hampson, managing director of House of Fraser, the department store
group owned by the Fayed family, is to leave the company at the end of the
month to return to his native Australia for family reasons.
Hampson has worked at House of Fraser for six years and has overseen the
slimming down of its department store portfolio and the modernisation of its
management systems. In his previous job as merchandise director of Harrods,
he was credited with inventing the slogan: 'There is only one Harrods; there
is only one sale.'
He will be succeeded by Andrew Jennings, who last year became general
manager of Harrods. Jennings, in his early 40s, began his retailing career
as a management trainee at Debenhams and worked at three department store
companies in South Africa before returning to the UK.
