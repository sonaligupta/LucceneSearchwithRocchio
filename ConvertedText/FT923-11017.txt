FT  27 JUL 92 / Wellcome to sell 270m shares at 800p


   By MAGGIE URRY


WELLCOME Trust last night set an 800p price for the sale of shares in
Wellcome, the drug company, bringing to a successful conclusion the biggest
non-privatisation share sale ever mounted.
The price compares with Friday's close of 826p and was considered a narrow
discount given the size of the issue and the recent difficult market
conditions.
Depending on last-minute fine-tuning, the trust will sell 270m shares. The
sale will raise Pounds 2.1bn after paying Pounds 75m to the banks and
brokers who organised the global sale.
The sale was completed in spite of the poor state of equity markets in the
UK, US and Japan during the period of the offer and the possibility of
hostilities breaking out in the Gulf again as the offer was closing on
Friday.
Mr Roger Gibbs, chairman of the trust, said the sale would increase the
medical charity's annual income to around Pounds 220m which 'will be of
great benefit to medical research'.
When the trust first announced its plan to reduce its stake in Wellcome from
73.5 per cent to less than 50 per cent, the shares stood at Pounds 11.26.
The trust considered cutting its stake to 25 per cent through the sale of
417m shares. In June it indicated the offer would be of 330m shares.
Although the trust had bids for 360m shares it decided to cut back the sale
to ensure a successful aftermarket. If it sells 270m shares it will still
hold 42 per cent of the company's equity.
Trading in the shares will start at 8.30 this morning. Robert Fleming, the
merchant bank co-ordinating the sale, has allocated an extra 40m shares
under the 'green-shoe' option. It can stabilise the share price by buying up
to 40m shares until August 26 if the price falls below 800p. If it buys back
less than 40m shares the sale will, in effect, have been increased.
Last night Fleming was finalising allocations to investors who put in
tenders for the shares. UK institutions were slightly favoured and about 60
per cent of the shares will go to them. US investors will receive about 23
per cent, although they made 25 per cent of the bids. Japanese investors
will take about 5 per cent with the rest divided between other regions and
the UK public offer.
Individual bidders were scaled back according to a number of criteria. Those
who put in bids early were rewarded, and a slight advantage was given to
bidders who were aggressive on price.
