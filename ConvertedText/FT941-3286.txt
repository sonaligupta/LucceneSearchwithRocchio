Dana Corporation of the US has agreed to buy a 47 per cent stake in German
vehicle components maker Kolbenschmidt from the troubled Metallgesellschaft
metals and engineering group.
No price was put on the deal, which is yet to be approved by cartel
authorities and both companies' boards, but the agreement marks the biggest
step so far in the promised sell-off at Metallgesellschaft. Dana, based in
Toledo, Ohio, has annual sales of around DM8.6bn (Dollars 4.88m).
