FT  28 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Jakarta updates trademark law


   By REUTER


   JAKARTA


Indonesia has updated its trademark law which should give more protection to
trademark owners, analysts said, Reuter reports from Jakarta. But the first
new trademark law in 31 years, which takes effect next April, could take a
while to bite.
The new law will stop the Indonesian trademark office giving licences to new
users of widely known trademarks. Local businessmen have registered
duplicates and tried to sell them back to the original owners. The law
includes criminal charges against 'copycats' and allows appeals before a
licence is awarded. Violators could face seven years' jail.
