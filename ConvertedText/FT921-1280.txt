FT  25 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Losses deepen to Pounds 6.5m at Hambro
Countrywide


   By DAVID BARCHARD


LOSSES AT Hambro Countrywide, the estate agency and insurance group, jumped
from Pounds 988,000 to Pounds 6.49m before tax in 1991 even though turnover
rose by 5 per cent.
Losses per share increased from 0.36p to 1.95p and no dividend is to be
paid.
Turnover rose from Pounds 88.4m to Pounds 93.2m.
Mr Christopher Sporborg, chairman, said losses had been at lower levels in
the second half of the year and the group still believed it was right to
pursue a strategy of increasing its market share and controlling costs
rather than shutting offices.
Nonetheless, he added: 'December 1991 was the worst month on record for most
of our estate agency business and we entered the new year with the level of
new business at historic lows. This will undoubtedly affect our results for
the first month or two of 1992.'
During the year Hambro Countrywide increased its branch network to 487 with
the purchase of the 22 branches of the Cheltenham & Gloucester estate
agency.
The estate agencies sold more mortgages - 16,538 against 15,138 the previous
year - and more life assurance policies, with 19,685 against 18,832.
House sales also increased, to 40,407, 7.8 per cent more than in 1990.
However, the average value of each house sold dropped by 5 or 6 per cent.
During the year Hambro Guardian Assurance entered the permanent health
market with a disability income benefit policy and new products for long
term care assurance.
