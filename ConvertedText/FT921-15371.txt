FT  10 JAN 92 / UN names Cambodia supremo


   By MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS


   UNITED NATIONS, NEW YORK


A SENIOR Japanese official was named last night to head the huge UN
operation in Cambodia, biggest of its kind ever planned by the world body,
Michael Littlejohns reports from the United Nations in New York.
The key appointment goes to Mr Yasushi Akashi, 60, an American-educated,
French-speaking former diplomat, who for the past four years was in charge
of the UN's disarmament department.
Japan is believed to have pressed Mr Boutros Ghali, the new
secretary-general, to name one of its nationals to the post. France also is
said to have been a contender, having been rebuffed in an attempt to have a
French general put in command of the military element of the operation.
Maj-Gen John Sanderson of Australia has been named to that post, with
Brig-Gen Michel Loridon of France as his deputy.
