FT  13 MAR 93 / Lisbon intervenes to defend escudo


   By PETER WISE


   LISBON


THE BANK of Portugal intervened heavily to defend the escudo yesterday after
Mr Antonio Borges, its deputy governor, resigned in a rift with the
government over monetary policy.
The escudo fell to a record low of DM94 before central bank buying pushed
the currency back up to about DM92.75. The stock market also reacted to the
uncertainties raised by Mr Borges' resignation with the the Bolsa de Valores
de Lisboa index falling 1.15 per cent on the day.
Mr Borges resigned on Thursday night in reaction to a speech by Mr Jorge
Braga de Macedo, finance minister, in which he criticised the central bank
for failing to heed the needs of the real economy and lower interest rates.
Rumours were rife in financial markets yesterday that Mr Miguel Beleza,
governor of the Bank of Portugal, might also resign unless he could secure a
guarantee from Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, prime minister, that the central bank
would have full freedom to conduct exchange rate and monetary policy as it
saw fit.
The divide between the government and the central bank on interest rates has
been growing for several weeks. Mr Borges, responsible for exchange rate
control, believes the escudo should be kept strong and interest rates should
only be allowed to fall as inflation comes down.
He has warned this would mean heavy casualties, particularly among small and
medium-sized companies, but was necessary to make the economy competitive
and ensure the transfer of resources to efficient companies.
