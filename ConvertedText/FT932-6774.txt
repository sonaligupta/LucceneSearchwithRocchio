FT  27 MAY 93 / Builders still await upturn


   By ANDREW TAYLOR


MUCH of Britain's construction industry remains in recession, despite the
recent revival in housebuilding, according to separate statistics published
yesterday by the Environment Department and Blue Circle, the country's
biggest cement producer, Andrew Taylor writes.
Orders received by contractors were 2 per cent higher during the first three
months of this year than in the same quarter of 1992, the department said.
Construction orders were 22 per cent higher than during the final three
months of last year, when investment confidence fell sharply in the wake of
sterling's withdrawal from the European exchange rate mechanism.
Orders for private housing rose 7 per cent on the first three months of last
year. Public housing and housing association orders were 26 per cent higher.
Orders for private commercial, mainly offices and shops, and private
industrial work by comparison were 23 per cent lower and 6 per cent lower
than during the first quarter of 1992.
Sales figures announced yesterday by Blue Circle showed a 6 per cent fall in
volume during the first four months of this year compared with the
corresponding period last year, but the company said demand had now
stabilised.
