FT  22 OCT 94 / Briefcase, Q&A: Challenging an assessment


My company vehicle was bought new in October 1991 for Pounds 16,000 at a
time when the list price was Pounds 19,750. My tax inspector has now issued
revised assessments for the past three tax years.
He maintains that the discount was given at the individual dealer's
discretion, and says dealer discounts are not taken into account when
calculating the market value for tax assessment purposes.
Can I challenge him? I believe many company car drivers may be in a similar
position.
You really have no hope of success in your appeals without professional
assistance. You must also be prepared to go to the House of Lords because
the Revenue is virtually certain to refuse to accept defeat before the
Special Commissioners, the High Court or the Court of Appeal.
The first step is probably a talk with the company's auditors or tax
advisers. You might well decide that the cost of a successful appeal would
probably exceed the amount of tax at stake.
It is on that basis, of course, that the Revenue wins most of its battles
with taxpayers for, despite the Taxpayer's Charter, it uses its financial
strength to discourage objections to its decisions.
No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the
answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as
soon as possible.
