FT  01 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Sumitomo sells UK mortgage book


Sumitomo, the Japanese bank, has sold its UK residential mortgage business
to Birmingham Midshires Building Society for an undisclosed sum.
The mortgage book includes about 1,600 borrowers, and is valued at about
Pounds 100m.
Sumitomo said: 'The terms of the deal were attractive to us and as a
centralised lender we do not see great potential for growth in the mortgage
lending business over the next few years. We therefore decided to pull out
of the UK residential mortgage market. Our core business in the UK is
commercial banking.'
