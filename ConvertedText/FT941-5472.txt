FT  07 MAR 94 / World News in Brief: European Monetary System


Despite interest rate cuts in Belgium, Spain and Germany, the order of
currencies in the EMS grid remains unchanged at the start of the week. The
Spanish peseta, the weakest currency in the grid, has lost ground against
all the others. The Irish punt, the strongest currency, has gained further
against the peseta.
