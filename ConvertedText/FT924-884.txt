FT  22 DEC 92 / Airline price-fixing charges


   By REUTER


   WASHINGTON


The US Justice Department yesterday charged eight big US airlines with
antitrust violations for allegedly fixing prices through a computerised fare
system, Reuter reports from Washington. After a three-year investigation, it
accused them of operating their computer system in a way that unreasonably
restrains price competition in the domestic airline industry.
The department said it reached settlements with United Air Lines and USAir,
which agreed to change their fare-filing practices. The proposed settlement
includes a prohibition on communicating future pricing intentions.
The other airlines are American, Delta, Northwest, Continental, Trans World
and Alaska Airlines.
The suit alleges that the airlines agreed at various times to increase some
fares and eliminate discounts for travel.
