FT  04 AUG 92 / Observer: Female takeover


Italy's banks are famous for many things, but sex changes are not one of
them. Not, at least, until the beginning of this month, when the three-way
merger of Rome's big banks created Banca di Roma - the country's largest
financial institution.
The new group is a mixed bag of male and female institutions. Banco di Santo
Spirito is a venerable gentleman of Italian finance. The Cassa di Risparmio
di Roma, the city's savings bank, whose managing director Cesare Geronzi is
very much in the driving seat, is a big earner, but virtually unknown.
Meanwhile, Banco di Roma is one of Italy's most international, if least
profitable, banks.
Adopting the latter's name allowed for instant recognition in Italy and
abroad, says Geronzi, a former Bank of Italy whizz. But the change of sex
from the Banco to Banca (the normal gender for banks) will give the new
company a more contemporary image, he claims.
Whatever the gender, Geronzi, who is chief executive of the new bank,
crowned its first day with a prize catch; Guido Carli, Italy's former
treasury minister and Geronzi's one-time boss as governor of the Bank of
Italy, is to be its special consultant for international finance and foreign
affairs.
Good to know that 78-year-old Carli's failure to win a Senate seat at
April's general elections has not dented the enthusiasm for public service
of one of Europe's best-known financial statesmen.
