FT  22 OCT 92 / Successor to Kanemaru named


   By REUTER


   TOKYO


MR Keizo Obuchi, an aide to ex-premier Mr Noboru Takeshita, was today named
as successor to former kingpin Mr Shin Kanemaru as chairman of the dominant
faction in Japan's ruling party, but rivals refused to accept the new
leader, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
The announcement was made by Mr Ken Harada, 73, a respected elder of the
faction, which is the largest of five groups that make up the Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP). Mr Harada chaired a week of meetings behind closed
doors to try to achieve consensus on the appointment.
However, Mr Obuchi's rivals, who back Finance Minister Tsutomu Hata as Mr
Kanemaru's heir, put off a decision on whether to accept the choice, NHK
television reported.
Mr Obuchi, 55, a former LDP secretary-general, could inherit extensive
influence in Japanese politics if he can avoid a break-up of the faction.
However, there has been much public criticism of the closed-door
horse-trading involved in his selection.
