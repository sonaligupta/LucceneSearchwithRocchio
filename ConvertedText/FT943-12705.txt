FT  23 JUL 94 / Tories increase pressure for assembly in Ulster


   By DAVID OWEN


Senior Conservative backbenchers are stepping up pressure on the government
to accede to unionist calls to finalise plans for a devolved Northern
Ireland assembly without waiting to agree an all-embracing settlement.
Senior MPs are encouraging ministers to abandon the old 'nothing is agreed
until everything is agreed' formula governing political talks on Northern
Ireland's future, in favour of an undertaking that nothing is implemented
until everything is agreed.
They suggest such a change could enable cross-party backing for a blueprint
for devolved government to be secured more quickly without departing from
the so-called three-stranded approach supported by nationalists.
This requires relations between Ulster and Dublin and London and Dublin to
be dealt with in the same process as the province's internal politics for
the purposes of the current talks.
News of the MPs' initiative emerged amid indications that unionists and Tory
rightwingers have been heartened by remarks made by Sir Patrick Mayhew,
Northern Ireland secretary, this week.
Sir Patrick told The Daily Telegraph newspaper that Dublin's territorial
claim to Ulster was the central issue to be resolved in drafting a joint
framework document aimed at encouraging the province's political parties to
return to the negotiating table.
Meanwhile leaders of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, prepared for this
weekend's conference - at which the party's response to the Downing Street
declaration is expected to be decided - as the cycle of violence in the
province continued with a killing and a spate of firebomb attacks. Mr Bobby
Monaghan, 44, a Catholic barman, was shot by loyalist gunmen from the
outlawed Ulster Freedom Fighters in Newtonabbey, north of Belfast.
In London, two High Court judges indicated that they intend to refer the
government ban on Mr Gerry Adams visiting mainland Britain to the European
Court of Justice in Luxembourg.
