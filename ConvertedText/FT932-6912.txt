FT  26 MAY 93 / International Company News: Hydro-Quebec ahead 16%

HYDRO-QUEBEC, one of Canada's two biggest electrical utilities and a big
international borrower, posted CDollars 520m (USDollars 409m) net profit for
the first quarter, up 16 per cent from a year earlier. The group benefited
from rationalisation and lower interest rates.
The first quarter usually provides most of the year's earnings because of
high industrial, commercial and consumer demand in the severest months of
winter. However Hydro-Quebec forecasts confidently it will earn at least
CDollars 760m for the full year, well up from 1992, despite the slow
recovery.
The utility is 100 per cent owned by the government.
