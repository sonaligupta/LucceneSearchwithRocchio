FT  25 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Tesco gets go-ahead for French buy


   By NEIL BUCKLEY


Tesco, the UK grocery chain, will today proceed with the purchase of the
94-store Catteau chain in northern France, five months after it first
announced the acquisition.
Tesco said the deal had been cleared by the regulatory authorities, and it
would today acquire 93,713 ordinary shares at FFr7,050 (Pounds 835) a share,
representing 51 per cent of Catteau's share capital, from the principal
directors of Catteau, and certain other shareholders.
The UK retailer also submitted for approval by the French stock exchange a
public offer for all outstanding preference shares, convertible bonds and
warrants of Catteau.
It said it had received irrevocable undertakings to accept the offer from
shareholders owning 163,286 preference shares, representing 20 per cent of
the share capital.
The offer was FFr705 for each preference share, FFr705 per convertible bond,
and FFr27.5 per warrant. The deal values Catteau at FFr1.46bn.
Tesco confirmed its initial investment would not exceed 85 per cent of the
company, or Pounds 148m, and it would finance the acquisition and offer from
internal sources.
Tesco first announced the conditional acquisition of the family-owed chain
last December, but had to wait until French treasury and EC approval had
been received, and Catteau's accounts had been finalised.
