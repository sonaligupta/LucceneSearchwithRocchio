FT  03 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Sun Alliance recovers and plans share issue


   By RICHARD LAPPER


SUN ALLIANCE, the composite insurer, yesterday reported pre-tax profits of
Pounds 61.7m for the first six months of 1993 and announced plans to raise
capital to take advantage of improved trading conditions.
The figures, which compared with a previous loss of Pounds 97.9m, reflected
rises in premium rates, falling claims in some lines and cuts in costs.
Plans to raise up to Pounds 300m by way of a new preference share issue will
allow the group to take advantage of 'attractive opportunities' in the UK
market when these arise, as well as continuing the repair work to the
group's balance sheet following heavy losses in the last three years.
In spite of the improvement in the results the market was unimpressed and
the shares closed 20p down at 367p.
Analysts suggested that a less than expected rise in net asset value to
Pounds 1.56m - compared with Pounds 1.55bn at December 31 - depressed
sentiment. Despite increases in the value of equity holdings, goodwill
write-offs, including those related to the acquisition of Hafnia, the Danish
insurer, and the purchase of remaining minorities in Swinton, the insurance
broker, held back growth in net assets.
Earnings per share amounted to 5.2p (losses of 14.1p). The interim dividend
is maintained at 5.25p.
Mr Roger Neville, group chief executive, said the profits reflected a
'substantial improvement in all major operations including insurance profits
in UK personal business and overseas and a significant increase in life
profits'.
Losses on UK domestic mortgage indemnity business have fallen to Pounds 60m
from Pounds 108m in the first half of 1992, but like its UK rivals, the
company has benefited from a rise in premium rates and a fall-off in claims
in some lines.
Underwriting losses fell to Pounds 153.1m (Pounds 280.8). The improvement
was heavily concentrated in the UK where losses fell from Pounds 244.7m to
Pounds 100.6m, despite net losses of Pounds 25m from the Bishopsgate bomb in
April.
Life profits increased substantially from Pounds 27.3m to Pounds 38.3m.
Income from new annual premiums in the UK expanded by 6 per cent. Investment
and other income rose to Pounds 176.5m (Pounds 155.6m). Premium income from
general business increased to Pounds 1.73bn (Pounds 1.46bn), but income from
life insurance fell to Pounds 509m (Pounds 627.9m).
