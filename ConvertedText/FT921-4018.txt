FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Red Book Details): Underlying inflation likely
to continue its steady fall


This section contains articles from the Financial Statement and Budget
Report for 1992-93, which was issued by the government after the
chancellor's speech. The report, known as the 'Red Book', gives the
government's economic forecasts to mid-1993, outlines the proposed tax
changes in the Budget and sets out the latest version of the Medium Term
Financial Strategy.
Inflation has fallen sharply over the past year. RPI inflation was 4 per
cent in January compared with 9 per cent a year earlier. Producer output
price inflation (excluding food, drink and tobacco) fell to 2 3/4 per cent
in February. RPI inflation may rise slightly in the next few months, as the
effects of last year's Budget and mortgage rate cuts drop out. But it is
forecast to fall back to 3 3/4 per cent by the fourth quarter, and to 3 1/4
per cent by the second quarter of 1993. Underlying inflation should continue
to fall steadily with producer price inflation expected to fall to 1 1/2 per
cent by mid-1993.
The level of GDP stabilised in the second half of 1991, but signs of
recovery evident in the summer and early autumn were not sustained. GDP fell
by nearly 2 1/2 per cent in 1991 as a whole. Activity is expected to recover
through 1992 as consumers' expenditure and exports pick up and destocking
comes to an end. GDP is forecast to rise by 1 per cent in 1992, but by 2 per
cent in the year to the second half.
The rate of increase of unemployment fell sharply through 1991, though
progress has slowed in recent months. Unemployment may continue rising for a
while yet, though at a slower rate.
The current account deficit is forecast to rise from Pounds 4 1/2 bn in 1991
to Pounds 6 1/2 bn in 1992, as domestic demand recovers and invisibles lose
the benefit of Gulf contributions and unusually low net EC contributions in
1991.
Since sterling joined the ERM, UK interest rates have fallen, narrowing
sharply the differential with rates in the low inflation ERM countries. M0
was within its target range for the whole of the last year and in the upper
half of its range since September.
The PSBR is forecast to be Pounds 13 3/4 bn in 1991-92 and Pounds 28bn in
1992-93.
World economy
Signs of recovery in the world economy faded towards the end of last year
and growth in the major seven economies in 1991 is now estimated at 1 per
cent, the lowest since 1982. GDP in the G7 is expected to rise by 1 1/2 per
cent in 1992, with growth picking up through the year. Inflation is forecast
to be 3 per cent by the end of the year.
Growth in the G7 economies remained very subdued in the closing months of
1991, with few signs of the recovery expected at the time of the Autumn
Statement. The US economy started to recover in the spring, but by the end
of the year growth had again slowed. In the second half of last year western
Germany registered a fall in output, and growth in Japan slowed sharply. For
the G7 as a whole, GDP is estimated to have grown by around 1 per cent in
1991, the weakest performance since 1982.
Industrial production in the G7 countries rose in the summer but stalled in
the autumn. There were renewed signs of weakness in most G7 countries around
the turn of the year. Business and consumer confidence indicators have
fallen sharply in recent months in Japan and Germany. In the US, business
confidence improved significantly in February, but consumer confidence was
at its lowest since 1974.
The very slow growth and increasing levels of spare capacity in almost all
G7 countries have placed continued downward pressure on inflation. In the
fourth quarter of 1991 consumer price inflation averaged 3 1/2 per cent in
G7 countries, compared with 5 1/2 per cent a year earlier. There were
particularly large reductions in the US and Canada, as well as the UK.
Against the trend, German inflation rose to a little over 4 per cent in the
latest three months, compared with 3 per cent a year earlier. The generally
good inflation performance has been helped by continuing weakness of
commodity prices, in particular of metals, which have been affected by
increased exports to the west from the former Soviet Union.
Outside Europe the easing of inflationary pressures has allowed short term
interest rates to fall further, by over 1 percentage point since October in
the US and Japan. In the US the discount rate is now at its lowest since
1964. In Europe interest rates remain high. Official rates rose in December
in all ERM countries except the UK, following the rise in German rates.
Government deficits widened in most G7 countries in 1991. Outside Germany
this mainly reflected the effects of automatic stabilisers.
The US current account moved back into small deficit in the second half of
1991, following the exceptional surplus in the first half, which was
entirely accounted for by Gulf war burden-sharing contributions. The
Japanese surplus in 1991 was Dollars 73bn, 2 1/4 per cent of GNP and the
highest since 1988. The German current account remained in small deficit
throughout the year.
Against a background of falling inflation, lower interest rates outside
Europe and widening fiscal deficits, a recovery in output is forecast this
year. GDP growth in the G7 is forecast to be 1 1/2 per cent in 1992. It is
expected to be stronger in the second half than the first, especially in the
US and Germany. In the first half of 1993 G7 GDP growth is forecast to be 2
3/4 per cent, about the same as the average between 1979 and 1989, the last
two cyclical peaks.
This forecast represents a muted recovery by past standards. This partly
reflects the comparatively slow recovery forecast for the US, where high
levels of personal and corporate indebtedness and an historically low saving
ratio make it unlikely that the rapid growth rates typical of previous
recoveries will be repeat ed. US growth is forecast to be about 2 per cent
by the end of this year, after a slow first half. A recovery in real
incomes, especially in the second half of the year, is the main factor lying
behind this pick-up. US exports are forecast to continue to perform well,
benefiting from the lagged effects of a weak dollar.
Only sluggish growth is forecast in the three main continental European
economies this year, averaging about 1 1/4 per cent. Growth in Germany will
be rather less than this, but will be helped by the removal of the temporary
income tax surcharge in July 1992. However, 1993 looks like being a better
year for these countries, particularly Germany.
Non-oil commodity prices are forecast to remain around present levels in
real terms. Oil prices have fallen since the autumn, reflecting weak demand
and changing views about the prospects for supplies from Kuwait, Iraq and
the former Soviet Union. The recent OPEC agreement is unlikely to lead to a
significant change in prices. Brent is assumed to average Dollars 18 a
barrel, close to recent levels.
Downward pressure to continue
With activity forecast to remain below trend, and a favourable outlook for
commodity prices, downward pressure on inflation is expected to continue. G7
consumer price inflation is forecast to be about 3 per cent by the end of
the year, remaining little changed in the first half of 1993. After reaching
a peak in the spring, German inflation is forecast to fall back, dropping
sharply in July as last year's oil tax rise drops out of the year-on-year
calculation. However, it will pick up again at the beginning of 1993 if the
proposed 1 point rise in the VAT rate is introduced.
Subdued growth in all the G7 countries makes it unlikely that there will be
large changes in current accounts. The US deficit is forecast to widen, but
this largely reflects the one-off nature of the Gulf war burden-sharing
contributions in 1991. For Japan much of the rise in the current account
surplus last year can be attributed to improvements in the terms of trade.
No repeat of this is forecast, and the current account surplus is therefore
expected to remain around 2 per cent of GNP.
Latest information suggests that the growth of total world trade in 1991 was
1 1/4 per cent. The collapse of trade both to and from the economies of
eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union contributed to the slow recorded
growth in 1991. Growth of total world trade is forecast to pick up to 3 3/4
per cent in 1992. It is not until 1993 that growth again approaches the
average for the second half of the 1980s. World trade in manufactures
follows a similar pattern.
GDP levelled out in the second half of 1991; in the fourth quarter it was
much the same as in the second quarter. But signs of recovery last summer
and early autumn were not sustained. GDP fell by nearly 2 1/2 per cent in
1991 as a whole. Non-oil GDP continued to decline through last year, though
at a moderating pace. By the fourth quarter it was 3 3/4 per cent below its
peak in the second quarter of 1990.
The failure of the recovery to take hold in the second half of 1991 was part
of a pattern of weakening activity in most of the major countries. Similar
factors may have been at work in a number of countries, and may have been
mutually reinforcing, resulting in a general deterioration in confidence. In
the UK this partly reversed the large improvement in business and consumer
confidence seen earlier in the year. Weaker activity in the rest of the
world meant that exports were lower than they would otherwise have been. And
domestic demand remained subdued, as consumers and businesses sought further
improvements in their financial position. Despite signs of a pick-up in
retail sales around the middle of the year, the expected recovery in
consumers' expenditure did not materialise. And although manufacturing
investment levelled out, total business investment continued to fall.
Domestic demand fell by  1/4 per cent between the first and second halves,
and by 3 per cent in 1991 as a whole.
Within GDP, the output of the service sector continued to fall in the second
half of 1991, though at a slower rate. Energy output rose in the third and
fourth quarters, as oil output recovered from the effects of safety-related
maintenance work which depressed output earlier in the year. However,
manufacturing output, after levelling out in mid-year, fell by a further 1
1/4 per cent in the fourth quarter, and by 5 1/4 per cent in 1991 as a
whole. This is consistent with CBI survey evidence which showed a steady
improvement in manufacturers' output expectations until the autumn, but some
deterioration since then, once it became clear that the recovery had not
become established.
Nevertheless the forces making for recovery are still in place, including
the continuing effects of lower interest rates, falling inflation and the
automatic fiscal stabilisers. And consumer and business confidence, though
lower than in the autumn, remain well above the levels of a year ago.
Although growth may be slow at first it should gather pace through the year,
as consumer spending picks up, recovery in the world economy boosts exports,
and destocking comes to an end. GDP is forecast to rise by 1 per cent in
1992, but by nearly 2 per cent in the year to the second half, and by 3 per
cent in the year to the first half of 1993. The pace of the recovery is
expected to be about the same as that following the previous two recessions.
Manufacturing output may rise by only  1/2 per cent in 1992, but is forecast
to rise more rapidly than GDP from mid-1992 onwards.
Consumers' expenditure flattened off in the second half of 1991, having
fallen by 2 3/4 per cent in the year to the second quarter. The saving ratio
rose sharply through 1990 and levelled off in 1991 at around 10 per cent,
historically high for a period of low inflation. Housing investment has also
been cut back sharply. The personal sector has therefore moved from
substantial financial deficit in 1988 to an estimated surplus of Pounds 17
1/2 bn, over 4 per cent of income, in 1991.
Personal income likely to rise
A number of factors should help to increase consumer spending. Real personal
disposable income, down  3/4 per cent in 1991, is forecast to rise by a
similar amount in 1992. The 4 1/2 point reduction in interest rates since
October 1990, and the halving of the inflation rate last year, have yet to
have their full effect. And although personal wealth has fallen, largely
because of lower house prices, it remains high by all but the standards of
the late 1980s. There is scope for the saving ratio to fall back from its
current high level without damaging personal sector balance sheets, but the
forecast assumes only a modest fall, to 9 1/2 per cent by the first half of
1993.
These positive influences may be offset to some extent by the effects of
continuing weakness in the housing market - any recovery here during 1992 is
likely to be slow - and by high levels of debt. The rise in the debt-income
ratio in the late 1980s was unprecedented, and past relationships provide
little guide to how far consumers might now want to retrench. However, a
sharp deceleration of personal borrowing stabilised the debt-income ratio in
1991, and some fall is possible during 1992. Lower interest rates mean that
the costs of servicing debt have already fallen sharply. As a result, real
disposable income for a typical family with a Pounds 30,000 mortgage has
risen by over 15 per cent since October 1990.
Consumers' expenditure is forecast to rise by 1 per cent in 1992, though the
initial pick-up could be slow and the precise timing is uncertain. It is
forecast to rise by 1 3/4 per cent in the year to the second half of 1992
and by 3 per cent in the year to the first half of 1993. Housing investment
is likely to remain weak for a while before picking up later this year. The
personal sector is expected to remain in substantial financial surplus.
Business investment peaked at record levels in early 1990 but has since
fallen as companies have sought to improve their financial position against
a backdrop of falling incomes. Business investment fell by 11 3/4 per cent
in 1991.
If investment bears its usual relation to the cycle, it may continue to
decline for a short time after output has begun to rise, though the fall
forecast for 1992 is much less than that seen in 1991. This is consistent
with the message from recent business surveys. The CBI balances for optimism
and investment intentions have weakened since the Autumn Statement but
remain well above their troughs of a year ago.
Even at its trough in 1992, the ratio of business investment to GDP is
forecast to be higher than in any year during the 1970s and the first half
of the 1980s, a consequence of the record growth rates seen in the late
1980s. With profitability increasing and the recovery becoming well
established, business investment is forecast to rise by 3 per cent in the
year to the first half of 1993. And the conditions should be in place for
stronger growth thereafter.
General government investment fell by 9 1/4 per cent in 1991, but is
forecast to rise by 10 3/4 per cent in 1992. The year-on-year growth rates
have been distorted by fluctuations in the quarterly pattern of local
authority investment, and by the surge in local authority investment at the
beginning of 1990 as authorities forestalled the new capital control regime
introduced in April of that year. The forecast level of general government
investment in 1992 is 24 per cent higher than that in 1988 and 50 per cent
higher than in 1979.
Preliminary indications for 1991 suggest that companies continued to cut
their stock levels in response to their difficult financial position. But
the rate of destocking has eased, and this trend is forecast to continue in
1992. As a result, while stock levels may continue to fall through much of
1992, stockbuilding is forecast to make a positive contribution to growth.
Companies may begin to build up stocks from late 1992 to keep pace with
rising sales and output. The change in stockbuilding could add 1 per cent to
GDP growth in the year to the first half of 1993.
Industrial and commercial companies' profits (net of stock appreciation) are
estimated to have fallen by 1 3/4 per cent in 1991. But with a sharp fall in
outlays, company saving rose a little. Together with the decline in capital
expenditure this led to a halving of the financial deficit in 1991.
Adjustment is forecast to continue in 1992, aided by a recovery in profits.
By the first half of 1993 industrial and commercial companies could be close
to financial balance.
Employment and unemployment
Companies have reduced employment more quickly relative to output in this
recession than in previous downturns. This no doubt reflects their
determination to keep costs under control to maintain com petitiveness, now
that sterling is in the ERM. As a result, productivity has held up better
this time than in previous post-war recessions. In the manufacturing sector,
productivity rose by 2 3/4 per cent in the year to the fourth quarter of
1991. It is now close to its all time high, even though output is 8 per cent
below its peak in the second quarter of 1990. Productivity growth is
expected to gather pace in 1992.
Latest data indicate that employment has fallen by 1m from its record level
in June 1990. It is likely to continue to fall for a while yet, though at a
moderating pace. The upward trend in unemployment abated sharply in the
course of 1991, much as expected. The trend monthly increase in unemployment
levelled off around the turn of the year but is likely to moderate further
in the months ahead as activity picks up.
The current account deficit in 1991 is estimated to have been Pounds 4 1/2
bn, sharply down from the Pounds 15 1/2 bn deficit recorded for 1990.
The visible deficit nearly halved from Pounds 18 1/2 bn in 1990 to Pounds
10bn in 1991. Exports reached record levels during the year, and low
domestic demand held imports down. The surplus on invisibles rose sharply to
Pounds 5 1/2 bn in 1991 from Pounds 3bn in 1990, thanks to Gulf receipts and
unusually low net EC contributions.
Unit labour costs grew much faster in the UK than elsewhere during 1990, and
cost competitiveness continued to weaken in early 1991. Since then it has
been improving. Price competitiveness deteriorated less than cost competiti
veness in 1990 and had already started to improve by the end of the year as
UK exporters cut their margins sharply.
Over the forecast period UK competitiveness is expected to improve, with
manufacturing unit labour costs growing less quickly here than in the other
main manufacturing countries. UK manufacturing unit labour cost growth has
already fallen to under 4 1/2 per cent from a peak of around 11 per cent. It
is expected to slow further in 1992 and to fall in the first half of 1993,
reflecting both the slowdown in earnings growth and the pick-up in
productivity.
Bigger share of world trade
The volume of exports of manufactures increased by 3 1/4 per cent in 1991.
While this was only around half as fast as in 1990, it nevertheless
represents a strong performance when set against estimated world trade
growth of manufactures of 1 3/4 per cent. The UK's share of world trade in
manufactures is estimated to have risen in 1991 for the third year running.
It may be that firms switched into exports in the face of weak domestic
demand. But there also appears to have been an improvement in underlying
performance. The favourable trend in competitiveness should keep the share
rising in the medium term, though it may be broadly unchanged in 1992 before
picking up again in the first half of 1993. Manufactured exports could be 6
3/4 per cent higher at the end of 1992 than a year earlier, and 4 per cent
higher in 1992 as a whole.
Imports of non-oil goods fell by 3 per cent in volume terms in 1991
following a near standstill in 1990. Nevertheless imports were on a rising
trend during the year. The low figure for 1991 as a whole was the
consequence of low domestic demand; the upward trend during the year, which
was mainly accounted for by imports of basic materials and capital goods,
was perhaps a sign that firms were preparing for the recovery.
Non-oil import volumes could rise by 4 3/4 per cent overall in 1992. The
growth is likely to be uneven - slow in the first half, faster in the second
 -in line with the projected pattern of demand. Import penetration is likely
to continue to rise, but modestly by past standards thanks to the favourable
trend in UK competitiveness. The trend in import penetration has been upward
for many years in the UK as elsewhere because of the effect on trade
patterns of increasing specialisation of world production.
The current account in 1991 benefited from an improvement in the non-oil
terms of trade. While export prices were hardly changed, import prices fell
by 2 3/4 per cent. Export and import prices are expected to change little in
1992.
North Sea oil production recovered sharply in the second half of 1991,
following the extended shutdowns for safety work which depressed output in
1990 and the first half of 1991. It is expected to remain around this higher
level in 1992, with oil production about 6 per cent up on 1991 and close to
the centre of the Department of Energy's Brown Book range.
In 1992 oil prices are assumed to be close to recent levels, nearly 10 per
cent lower than last year. But because production is forecast to be higher
than last year, the surplus on trade in oil is expected to rise to around
Pounds 1 1/2 bn.
The surplus on invisibles in 1991 turned out a good deal higher than
expected at the time of the Autumn Statement, largely because of significant
upward revisions to the balance of interest, profits and dividends (IPD).
But even after the revisions, the balance of IPD was only Pounds 1 1/2 bn in
1991, down from Pounds 3bn in 1990. The low figure was in part accounted for
by oil companies' stock losses as oil prices fell from their peak during the
Gulf crisis. But unusually low net government transfers offset the effect of
this on the invisibles balance. The low transfers were due to lower than
usual net payments to the EC and large one-off receipts from overseas
governments related to the Gulf war. As a result, the invisibles surplus
rose sharply in 1991, masking the weak IPD performance.
Because the special factors boosting the balance of transfers in 1991 will
not be repeated, the invisibles balance is projected to fall back to around
Pounds 4 1/2 bn in 1992, from Pounds 5 1/2 bn in 1991. But the underlying
trend is improving. The balance of services is forecast to rise in 1992. IPD
should recover from the low 1991 level as the oil price falls of 1991 are
assumed not to recur.
Net overseas assets are estimated to have risen to around Pounds 37bn at the
end of 1991 from around Pounds 20bn at the end of 1990. As the current
account was in deficit, this rise is more than accounted for by
revaluations, mainly reflecting movements in world stock markets. But some
capital flows are difficult to measure, and the outstanding stock of assets
is difficult to value, which means that estimates of net overseas assets
must be interpreted with considerable caution.
The current account deficit is expected to widen to Pounds 6 1/2 bn in 1992
from Pounds 4 1/2 bn in 1991. The fall in the invisibles surplus accounts
for half the increase as the special factors in 1991 unwind. Although the
deficit on manufactures rises by Pounds 1 1/2 bn, the trade performance of
the manufacturing sector is nevertheless expected to be strong. This
deterioration is relatively gentle given expected world trade and domestic
demand growth, because of the improved competitive position of UK industry.
Over the period 1988-1990, the private sector's financial position
deteriorated sharply as spending outstripped income. The deficits were
without precedent in the last 70 years. The position was unsustainable and a
correction was inevitable; the private sector reduced its deficit in 1990
and moved into surplus in 1991.
The surplus is forecast to increase in 1992 and the first half of 1993 to
levels which, as a percent of GDP, would be comparable with those of the
first half of the 1980s. Both companies and persons contributed to the
improvement in the private sector's financial position in 1991, and the
pattern in 1992 is expected to be much the same. The large current account
deficits of 1988-1990 were the counterpart of the unprecedentedly large
private sector financial deficits. The move of the private sector back into
surplus is reflected in lower current account deficits.
Producer output price inflation (excluding food, drink and tobacco) has
continued to fall in recent months, to 2 3/4 per cent in February - the
lowest rate since 1969 - compared with 6 1/2 per cent early last year. The
annualised rate in the latest three months on the previous three months is
now down to 2 1/4 per cent. Although unit labour cost growth is well down on
a year earlier, profit margins remain under pressure.
Retail price inflation has also fallen substantially, to 4 per cent in
January compared with 9 per cent a year earlier. The all-items rate has
fluctuated over the last few months as the effects of changes in mortgage
rates and oil prices in late 1990 have dropped out of the calculation.
Excluding these, the underlying rate has continued to fall in response to
weak consumer demand and smaller rises in food prices. But retail price
inflation excluding mortgage interest payments remains at around 5 1/2 per
cent, somewhat above producer price inflation. This partly reflect s the
stubbornness of inflation in some services prices.
Underlying earnings growth below 7 1/2 %
Pay settlements have fallen in response to falling inflation, weak labour
market conditions and pressure on companies to maintain competitiveness.
Provisional CBI data show settlements in manufacturing in the last quarter
of 1991 averaging 4 per cent compared with 9 per cent a year earlier. Whole
economy underlying earnings growth stood at 7 1/4 per cent in December,
compared with a peak of 10 1/4 per cent in July 1990. This is the first time
since 1967 that underlying earnings growth has been below 7 1/2 per cent.
Earnings growth should continue to fall over the coming year as lower
settlements feed through, although there may be some pick-up in wage drift
as activity increases. A cyclical recovery in productivity should also help
to restrain manufacturers' unit labour costs, which are forecast to fall as
the recovery gathers pace. This underpins the forecast of further falls in
producer price inflation, to 2 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1992 and 1
1/2 per cent by the middle of 1993. There should still be scope for
companies to rebuild profit margins as demand rises.
Underlying retail price inflation is also expected to fall through 1992 as
producer price inflation continues to fall, and services prices increasingly
respond to disinflationary pressures. Headline inflation may pick up in the
coming months as the effects of last year's mortgage rate cuts and the 1991
Budget switch from the community charge to VAT drop out of the calculation.
But RPI inflation is forecast to be down to 3 3/4 per cent by the fourth
quarter of 1992 and 3 1/4 per cent by the second quarter of 1993.
The expected progress on underlying inflation is also reflected in the
forecast for the GDP deflator, which measures the price of domestic value
added (principally unit labour costs and profits per unit of output). The
GDP deflator is expected to rise by 7 per cent in 1991-92, of which the 1991
Budget VAT increase contributes about 1 per cent, but by only 4 1/2 per cent
in 1992-93.
Since the UK joined the ERM, the gap between UK interest rates and those in
the low inflation ERM countries has narrowed sharply as UK base rates have
been cut to 10 1/2 per cent from 15 per cent. The gap between base rates and
official interest rates in Europe fell further in mid-December last year
when all other ERM countries increased their official interest rates, and UK
rates were unchanged.
Following the December rise in other European interest rates, sterling fell,
reaching its lowest value against the Deutschemark since ERM entry. But the
Government's firm public commitment to the existing ERM parities and the
growing awareness in the foreign exchange markets of the improved prospects
for UK inflation helped to ensure that the pressure was short-lived.
Long term interest rates over the last year have been on a downward trend,
consistent with market expectations of falling short term rates and
inflation. The yield on 20-year gilts has fallen from 10 1/4 per cent at the
beginning of last year to little over 9 per cent on average in recent weeks.
Equity prices recovered sharply in early 1991, but showed little further
growth in the remainder of the year. Equity prices have risen over the last
couple of months, perhaps indicating improving expectations of economic
growth.
The annual growth rate of M0 has remained comfortably within its 0-4 per
cent target range for the first 10 months of 1991-92. In the first half of
the financial year M0 growth was a little below the mid-point of the range;
in the second half it has been a little above the mid-point. M0 velocity
growth has been consistent with its long term trend. The annual growth rate
of M4 has continued the fall which started in early 1990. Then it was about
18 per cent; in January this year it was about 6 per cent. Bank and building
society lending growth peaked at around 25 per cent at the end of 1988;
since then it too has fallen to about 6 per cent. Recent figures suggest
that the sharp declines in the growth rates of M4 and bank and building
society lending may have come to an end. M4 velocity, which has been on a
steep downward trend since the early 1980s, appears to have fallen only
marginally over the last year.
Decline in home loans
Lower borrowing for house purchase has played a significant part in the
slowdown of lending growth. But persons' other borrowing has remained
subdued. The personal sector debt-income ratio, which rose steeply in the
1980s, partly reflecting financial liberalisation, seems now to have
stabilised and may even be falling back a little.
Firms have also been cutting back on bank borrowing. Market conditions in
1991 have led them to prefer capital issues as a source of finance. Although
M4 and M4 lending growth rates are at low levels as a result of the slowdown
in activity, there is little evidence that the economic recovery in prospect
will be inhibited by a shortage of bank or building society credit.
The accompanying table compares the main elements of the forecast publi shed
in the 1991 FSBR with the outturns for 1991 or the latest estimates for
1991-92.
Inflation in 1991 was much as forecast. Errors on the forecasts of demand,
activity and the current account were within the average errors from past
forecasts. GDP in 1991 fell by a little more than forecast. Partly as a
result the current account deficit was smaller than forecast. And the public
sector borrowing requirement is likely to be well above last year's Budget
forecast, though the error was no larger than the past average.
All forecasts are subject to risks and uncertainties. The forecasts
