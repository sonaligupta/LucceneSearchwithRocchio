FT  05 JUN 92 / Surgery for Buchanan


   By REUTER


   WASHINGTON


REPUBLICAN presidential contender Patrick Buchanan will undergo heart
surgery today to replace an aortic valve, his campaign said yesterday,
Reuter reports from Washington.
Doctors expected him to recover fully in about seven weeks. The surgery will
be performed at the Washington Hospital Centre.
Mr Buchanan, 53, a conservative television commentator and newspaper
columnist, challenged President George Bush strongly in New Hampshire and
other early primaries this year, in some cases winning more than 30 per cent
of the vote.
But his challenge has faded in later contests and Mr Bush easily beat him on
Tuesday in the Californian Republican primary.
