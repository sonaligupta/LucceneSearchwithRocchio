FT  16 MAR 94 / International Company News: Pioneers of desktop publishing

Aldus and Adobe Systems, the pioneers of desktop publishing software, are to
merge. They will form a half billion dollar company that will address a
broad range of electronic publishing applications.
Adobe will exchange 1.15 shares of its common stock for each share of Aldus
common stock. At current prices the transaction is valued at approximately
Dollars 525m.
'We are committed to achieving the cost savings necessary to make this
transaction non-dilutive in the first full year of the combined operations,'
said Mr John Warnock, chairman and chief executive of Adobe Systems.
'We believe our two companies, each with a rich history of inventing
different aspects of the electronic publishing revolution, are simply much
stronger together - both technologically and financially - than we would be
by remaining separate,' said Mr Warnock.
Adobe and Aldus are widely recognised for having created desktop printing
and electronic publishing, which has grown into a Dollars 2bn industry since
the early 1980s.
On a combined basis, the companies had revenues last year of Dollars 520m
and more than 2,100 employees. For fiscal 1993, Adobe reported revenues of
Dollars 313m and net income of Dollars 57m, while Aldus reported total
revenues of about Dollars 207m and net income of Dollars 9.5m.
