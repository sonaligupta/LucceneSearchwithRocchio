FT  22 JUL 94 / International Capital Markets: Milan bourse plans stock
index futures


   By ANTONIA SHARPE


Milan stock exchange plans to round off its modernisation process with the
introduction later this year of stock index futures, a move which will bring
it in line with the rest of Europe.
The Italian stock exchange council and Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI)
yesterday signed an agreement enabling the transfer of the BCI 30 continuous
index of Italy's most liquid and highly-capitalised shares to the exchange.
Due to be re-named MIB 30, it will be the reference index for derivative
instruments in Milan.
Mr Attilio Ventura, stock exchange chairman, said a futures market was
indispensable for a well-functioning bourse. Trading is expected to start on
November 28 and will be conducted on Milan's 'telematico' screen-based
system.
Analysts welcomed the arrival of futures trading in Milan, which they said
would reduce volatility in the cash market and facilitate the hedging of
positions in Italian stocks. 'Investors will use futures to speculate rather
than the underlying stocks,' said Kleinwort Benson's Mr Enrico Ponzone.
Italian stock options will continue to be traded by open-outcry until next
spring, when they are due to be transferred to the telematico.
The change from open-outcry to screen-based trading has been at the heart of
the bourse's modernisation programme, which included investor protection
legislation and plans to shorten settlement from one month to five days.
Despite some initial technical difficulties, stock trading in Milan is now
totally on-screen and has greatly improved turnover, price transparency and
investor confidence, all pre-requisites for the Italian government's
privatisation programme.
Daily turnover reached L2,000bn in April in the aftermath of the general
election. Turnover has since fallen to around L1,000bn a day but is still
well above levels recorded last year.
