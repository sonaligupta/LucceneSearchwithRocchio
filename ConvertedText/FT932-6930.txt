FT  26 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Exceptionals help Readicut jump 63% to top
Pounds 19m


   By ANGUS FOSTER


READICUT International, the household textile, carpeting and yarn company,
yesterday reported increased profits, but said UK economic recovery remained
'patchy'.
Pre-tax profits increased by 63 per cent to Pounds 19.2m in the year to
March 31, but were distorted by one-off exceptional items. Excluding
exceptionals from one-off disposals and closures, profits increased by 11
per cent from Pounds 13.5m to Pounds 15m.
Mr Clive Shaw, managing director, said the company's main UK markets were
'up and down' and predicted slow recovery in the US. 'The rest of Europe is
still going down,' he said.
Turnover increased by 7 per cent to Pounds 234.8m, of which Pounds 10m
stemmed from exchange rate gains. The company is considering switching from
year end to average exchange rates.
Operating profits increased by 7.2 per cent to Pounds 17.3m, reflecting
continued cost cutting. There were redundancy costs of Pounds 750,000 as
staff numbers fell by 84 to 3,800.
Capital expenditure increased more than Pounds 4m to Pounds 11.8m against
depreciation of Pounds 8.6m. Spending is expected to increase again this
year to Pounds 14.8m.
The company sold Russells Rubber in February, leading to an exceptional
profit of Pounds 4.2m, and a cash benefit of Pounds 8.5m. This reduced net
borrowings from Pounds 11.5m to Pounds 1.8m, while gearing fell from 19 per
cent to 2 per cent. Interest costs fell to Pounds 2.3m (Pounds 2.67m) helped
by lower interest rates.
Earnings per share, helped by a lower tax rate, increased 84 per cent to
7.5p (4.07p). The company proposed a maintained final dividend of 2.81p, to
make an unchanged total of 3.44p.
COMMENT
Even without the flattering effects of FRS 3, these were very good results
from Readicut. Taking out the exceptionals, and remembering the prior year
was helped by a one off insurance payment, the company managed to increase
profits despite recession and nearly Pounds 1m in extra net costs. These
included the redundancy payments and start up costs for a new Belgium
factory, making car boot carpet for the European Ford Mondeo, which is
likely to make a sizeable contribution this year. Aside from the results,
Readicut has a strong balance sheet and has maintained capital spending
throughout the recession. All of which is wonderful news for shareholders
who bought last summer, when the shares hit 63p. With the price now up to
98p, on more than 16 times next year's forecast earnings, the shares are
well valued.
