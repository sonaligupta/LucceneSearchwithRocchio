FT  17 JAN 92 / World Trade News: US under attack over 'managed trade'


   By DAVID GARDNER


   BRUSSELS


THE US is 'drifting towards a preference for managed trade' which is
undermining efforts to secure an open multilateral trading system through
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), according to Sir Leon
Brittan, EC competition commissioner.
His remarks coincide with an increasingly sharp transatlantic trade
argument, which in the past week has centred on the farm subsidies row
within the Uruguay Round negotiations, and the renewed controversy over
German exchange rate support to the European Airbus consortium through
Daimler Benz.
Sir Leon, speaking to the Centre for European Policy Research in Paris,
highlighted 'political deals' the US has struck to gain Japanese market
share in semiconductors, public works, aeronautics, satellites and
telecommunications and, following President George Bush's visit to Tokyo
last week, cars.
He also noted the US's growing arsenal of protective trade measures, ranging
from export subsidies and the Buy American Act, to a broad definition of
national security which seals off the US defence market and supports related
sectors such as civil aviation.
He contrasted European car makers' efforts to attack the Japanese market,
and the EC's phased liberalisation of Japanese car imports, to the US's
'reaction . . . to demand a certain share of the Japanese market on
political rather than commercial grounds'.
Efforts to conclude the Uruguay Round, he said, would be 'weakened by the
evidence of a US drift towards managed trade'. Sir Leon warned, moreover,
that the European Commission would insist that any openings made in Japan to
US business would have to be extended to the EC.
He acknowledged that Japanese business culture all but excluded imports, but
insisted that the US counter-strategy would fail to narrow the productivity
and competitiveness gap with Japan.
