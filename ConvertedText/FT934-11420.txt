FT  01 NOV 93 / Attack on teacher training plans


PROPOSALS to base initial teacher training in schools rather than colleges
poses a threat to quality and could lead to political control over teacher
education, the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals said yesterday.
There was 'no logical argument' to support a fundamental shift towards
school-centred teacher training, Mr Kenneth Edwards, committee chairman,
said in a detailed response to the government.
A Teacher Training Agency, proposed as a funding council for teacher
education, would be 'another costly, politically appointed body' and a
'sinister precedent' for the future possible fragmentation of higher
education.
The proposed separation of education research from other university research
would also set a dangerous precedent.
