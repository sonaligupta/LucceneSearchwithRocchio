another 1.5% ahead of talks

   TOKYO


EQUITIES fell in the final minutes of trading as stock index futures
contracts weakened and investment trust fund purchases lost momentum, writes
Wayne Aponte in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average ended 81.31 lower at 20,476.16, after trading between
20,453.57 and 20,691.20. The Topix Index of all first section issues slipped
2.43 at 1,610.69 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.33 to
1,241.69.
Volume was 400m shares compared to Friday's 425m. Advances equaled declines
at 505, with 168 issues unchanged.
Brokers said that favourable money supply data for April, released after
Friday's close, which showed a 0.6 per cent rise from the previous year,
kept activity firm early in the session.
However, clearer signs of an economic recovery are needed to motivate
investors to enter the market. 'We need more good figures,' said Mr Ryoji
Tanaka, head of Japanese equity trading at Kidder Peabody International. But
investors should become more confident about entering the market as the end
of the earnings results season approaches, he added.
Technical analysts predict that the Nikkei average's short-term range will
remain between 20,250 to 20,600 in the absence of incentives.
Good earnings results encouraged market participants to buy shares in the
shipbuilding sector. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the day's most active
issue, rose Y1 to Y735, Hitachi Zosen Y6 to Y609 and Mitsui Engineering and
Shipbuilding Y2 to Y477.
Non-ferrous metals stocks continued to rise in tandem with the gains in the
gold price overseas. Mitsui Mining and Smelting put on Y19 to Y563, Dowa
Mining Y7 to Y667 and Mitsubishi Materials Y6 to Y521.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone rose after it filed for government approval
to increase the charge rate of public telephones on Friday. The shares rose
Y16,000 to Y985,000.
In Osaka, the OSE average ended 22.49 higher at 22,745.07, in volume of
23.4m shares.
Roundup
APART from another impressive performance from Hong Kong the region was
generally muted.
HONG KONG continued its record run, the Hang Seng index rising 106.43 or 1.5
per cent to 7,276.39 in turnover of HKDollars 4.7bn.
The announcement of the fourth round of Sino-British talks scheduled for
Friday encouraged buying, some commentators noted.
Hutchison Whampoa and Cheung Kong topped the active list, rising HKDollars
1.10 and 30 cents respectively to HKDollars 21.90 and HKDollars 28.00.
Investors were also seen switching into utilities: HK Telecom rose 30 cents
to HKDollars 11.50 while China Light added HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars
39.75.
SINGAPORE fell back but some observers commented that overall sentiment
remains positive. The Straits Times industrial index lost 6.71 to 1,855.15
in turnover of SDollars 462m.
Amcol Holdings jumped 31 cents to SDollars 3.26 after giving details of its
involvement in an Indonesian satellite project.
SEOUL was slightly firmer for the seventh consecutive session in spite of
some profit-taking which erased an early 6 point gain. The composite index
added 0.57 to 733.91 in turnover of Won706.8bn.
TAIWAN reversed early gains to close lower on late selling. The weighted
index, which had risen 25 points, ended 36.51 lower at 4,258.92, its fifth
straight fall. Turnover was TDollars 15.3bn, the lowest in a full session
since January.
Conflict within the ruling Nationalist party and recent poor economic data,
including a cut in this year's official GNP forecast, continued to affect
sentiment.
However, Hualon, the textile group, went against the trend, gaining 80 cents
to TDollars 31.10 on reports that a consortium of local banks had agreed a
loan arrangement of TDollars 3bn.
MANILA moved slightly ahead although activity was reported to have been
subdued. The composite index rose 5.61 to 1,577.71 in turnover of 202.4m
pesos. Philippine National Bank was among the day's biggest gainers, rising
5 pesos to 249.
KUALA LUMPUR fell back on profit-taking, the composite index losing 4.87 to
724.48. Volume declined sharply to 431m shares against Friday's 642m.
Among the actives Tanjong shed 70 cents to MDollars 13.40.
AUSTRALIA slipped towards the close in spite of a strong performance by gold
stocks.
The All Ordinaries index lost 10.1 to 1,685.5 with banking and transport
particularly weak. Turnover was ADollars 302.3m.
In the gold sector, Newcrest gained 13 cents to ADollars 4.18, Placer
Pacific climbed 5 cents to ADollars 2.70 and Poseidon Gold rose 6 cents to
ADollars 3.01.
NEW ZEALAND shrugged off a weak opening to finish stronger with a gain in
the NZSE-40 index of 9.67 to 1,628.27. Turnover was NZDollars 33.5m.
Air New Zealand rose 10 cents to NZDollars 2.20 on strong overseas demand.
Elsewhere Fletcher Challenge rose 1 cent to NZDollars 2.65 while Brierley
eased 1 cent to NZDollars 1.06.
BANGKOK lost nearly 2 per cent after the SET index fell below the 850 level,
closing off 17.14 at 841.23. However, turnover was a below average Bt2.6bn.
Some analysts commented that recent disappointing first quarter results had
depressed sentiment.
