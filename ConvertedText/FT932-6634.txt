FT  27 MAY 93 / UK Company News: European Colour at Pounds 0.64m


   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent


EUROPEAN Colour, which makes pigments for printing inks, lifted pre-tax
profits from Pounds 47,000 to Pounds 640,000 in the year ended March 31.
A 22 per cent surge in European mainland sales helped group turnover rise by
over 5 per cent to Pounds 14.01m (Pounds 13.27m). The final dividend is
0.525p (0.4p) making 0.8p (0.65p) for the year.
Earnings per share rose to 1.35p (0.33p).
European sales showed similar growth in 1991-92 and now account for 27 per
cent of turnover.
This follows development of new high quality products offering brighter
colours, and attainment of the ISO 9001 European quality standard.
The company made small net gains from Britain's exit from the ERM after
price adjustments to imports and exports, but these went towards eliminating
a Deutschemark overdraft it was maintaining as a hedge.
Mr Mike Armitage, managing director, said the company was constrained by its
small size, but was a successful niche player, selling to inkmakers. He said
the company would grow organically.
He would not rule out acquisitions if the fits were right. 'But don't hold
your breath,' he added.
