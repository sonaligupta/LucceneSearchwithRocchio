FT  05 AUG 93 / Government announces changes for 25 franchises in BR
privatisation


   By JOHN WILLMAN


THE government yesterday announced changes in the shape of three of the 25
franchises for passenger services to be offered when British Rail is
privatised, John Willman writes.
The changes affect the franchises for InterCity Cross Country, the central
division of Regional Railways and Regional Railways' long-distance
inter-urban services.
Services currently operated by more than one BR profit centre will be
assigned to the leading operator, under the final plans. This means that the
Euston-Northampton-Birmingham services, for example, will be included in the
franchise for Network SouthEast North.
Announcing the changes, Mr John MacGregor, secretary of state for transport,
said that the franchises would 'reflect regional identity and the aim of
providing better services for rail users'.
