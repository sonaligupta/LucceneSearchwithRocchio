FT  21 JUL 94 / Police to get 3% pay rise under Sheehy formula


   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor


The 120,000 police officers in England and Wales will get a pay rise of 3
per cent from September 1 under a new pay formula recommended in the Sheehy
report on police reorganisation.
The rise is at the top end of public-sector groups - most civil servants and
local-government employees will get just over 2 per cent - but below the
3.75 per cent that the police officers would have received under their old
pay formula.
The old pay formula linked the pay rise to the average earnings figure in
May. The new formula links the pay rise to the median of private-sector
non-manual pay settlements.
The pay rise is accompanied by an overhaul of police pay and the agreement
to introduce a new appraisal system in 1996.
The new grading system will give many officers a substantial increase in
their basic pay. The starting salary for a constable, for example, will rise
from Pounds 12,744 to Pounds 13,585 and the lowest level for a sergeant will
rise from Pounds 20,343 to Pounds 20,750.
The total cost of the re-grading is about Pounds 65m but that will be
covered by savings from other aspects of the restructuring. The most radical
is an abolition of the housing allowance - about Pounds 4,000 per year - for
new entrants, and a less frequent up-rating of the present allowance.
There will also be a change in the way that police overtime is paid for,
with some overtime no longer being paid for at all.
The Police Federation said that the overall effect of the restructuring will
be to reduce the pay of a new recruit by up to 20 per cent.
Although many of the restructuring plans draw on proposals made in the
Sheehy report the most radical Sheehy proposal - to abolish incremental
scales - was rejected.
