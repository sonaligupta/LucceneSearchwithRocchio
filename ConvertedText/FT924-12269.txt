FT  21 OCT 92 / British Gas accused on tariff


BRITISH Gas was accused yesterday of attempting to renege on the tariff
formula agreement introduced in April which has already produced two price
reductions for 18m customers.
In a speech to a London conference Sir James McKinnon, director-general of
gas supply, said the company's insistance on a wide-ranging reference to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission was 'in the hope that an outcome would
emerge which was more favourable than the one the company had already signed
up to'.
He said the fundamental issue as competition increased was ownership of the
pipeline system, and a study had led Ofgas 'to question whether it would be
possible to operate a fair system if that system remains in the ownership of
British Gas'.
