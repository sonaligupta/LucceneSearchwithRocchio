FT  01 DEC 94 / International Company News: PowerGen wins tender to buy
plant in Hungary


   By VIRGINIA MARSH

PowerGen, the UK electricity generator, said yesterday it had won an
international tender to negotiate the purchase of the first Hungarian power
plant to come up for privatisation.
It said it hoped to complete negotiations for the Csepel power plant, an
independent power producer, by the end of the year.
The acquisition price has not been disclosed. However, PowerGen is believed
to be considering investing up to Dollars 100m on top of the purchase price
to upgrade the plant and construct a combined-cycle gas turbine generator at
Csepel.
The existing gas-fired plant, located on an island on the Danube on the
outskirts of Budapest, has installed electricity capacity of 43MW and 400MW
in thermal energy.
It was built to service an industrial park and 12,000 households on the
island.
PowerGen said the plant's proximity to Budapest and its population of 2.5m
electricity users made it an attractive acquisition.
Under plans announced this week, Hungary aims to privatise a large part of
MVM, its electricity monopoly, mainly through sales to western strategic
investors over the next two years.
Deregulation and increased competition in the sector will widen the scope
for independent power producers, such as the Csepel plant.
PowerGen, which began talks with the Hungarian privatisation authorities
last February, is believed to have beaten competition from Germany, France
and Belgium in the tender.
It said it hoped that the Csepel acquisition would strengthen its position
ahead of expected intense competition for stakes in MVM companies next year.
Several of the UK's regional electricity companies are also looking for
diversification opportunities in Hungary and other former communist
countries.
