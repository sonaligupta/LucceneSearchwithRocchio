FT  05 AUG 92 / Hong Kong forces 60 Vietnamese to go home

   HONG KONG


HONG KONG forcibly repatriated 60 Vietnamese boat people yesterday,
including 16 members of Vietnam's Nung ethnic minority, amid concerns that
some returnees may face persecution.
Asia Watch, a New York-based human rights group, said the Nung people, who
fought on the side of the French colonialists and later the US forces during
Vietnam's civil war, could be at risk if they returned to Vietnam.
The minority fled the country after being persecuted for their past
associations. Asia Watch said they could face imprisonment, police abuse and
forced labour if they had to return.
The Hong Kong government yesterday said Asia Watch had submitted a list of
133 members of the Nung minority. But Mr Brian Bresnihan, the colony's
refugee co-ordinator, said that 24 on the list had returned to Vietnam
voluntarily last year. There was no evidence that they had been subject to
persecution at the hand of the authorities, he said.
So far 295 people have been returned to Vietnam against their will and
20,317 have returned voluntarily.
Hong Kong is currently housing 52,151 boat people in detention camps. Of
these, 24,319 are awaiting repatriation, the status of 24,646 has yet to be
determined, and 3,186 have been classified as legitimate refugees.
In May, the Hong Kong authorities reached an agreement with Hanoi to
repatriate those who are not classed as refugees. So far this year, 6,472
have returned - of which 134 were compulsory repatriations - compared with
7,753 for the whole of 1991. Repatriation does seem to have stemmed the flow
of boat people into Hong Kong. This year only nine have arrived in the
colony, compared with 20,207 in 1991.
