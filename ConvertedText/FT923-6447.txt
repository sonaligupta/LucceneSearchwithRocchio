FT  25 AUG 92 / World share prices slide as dollar support fails: FT-SE 100
falls 54 points; D-Mark's strength adds to strain on pound and lira

WORLD STOCK and bond markets fell sharply yesterday after repeated
intervention by central banks failed for the second trading day in a row to
stop the decline of the dollar.
Investors sold financial assets on fears that the continuing fall of the US
currency against the D-Mark could trigger a rise in interest rates on both
sides of the Atlantic.
The continued strength of the German currency also put pressure on the pound
and the Italian lira as they hovered close to their floors against the
D-Mark in the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System. That
threatened a rise in interest rates in both the UK and Italy.
The intervention to buy dollars for D-Marks by 15 central banks, including
the Federal Reserve, Bundesbank and the Bank of England, failed to arrest
the dollar's decline.
In London, it closed at a record low of DM1.4035, down more than 3 pfennigs
on the day and 7 pfennigs in the past week. In US trading, it slipped
further to DM1.3988, but recovered slightly to DM1.4015 at the close. In
Tokyo today it opened at DM1.40345.
The pound gained nearly 5 cents against the dollar in London, closing at
Dollars 1.9945. At one point in intra-day trading, sterling was over Dollars
2.00 for the first time since February 1991. In New York it finished at
Dollars 1.994.
On the London stock market, the FT-SE 100 index lost 54.6 to 2,311.1, its
biggest one-day fall since the failed Soviet coup against president Mikhail
Gorbachev a year ago.
Bourses in Frankfurt and Paris lost 1.4 per cent and 3.1 per cent
respectively, while on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed
down 25.93 at 3,228.17. This followed a 50-point decline on Friday.
Bond prices in Europe and the US also fell sharply. The US benchmark 30-year
bond fell more than a point on fears that the lower dollar would deter
foreign investors from buying US government securities.
In yesterday's intervention, the fifth such operation in the past month, the
central banks bought dollars in five separate waves in European and North
American trading. The action took place as the US currency fell through the
DM1.43 level in Europe.
The volume of intervention appeared about the same as it had been last
Friday, in which case about Dollars 1bn would have been spent. This modest
level suggested that the Fed wanted to smooth the path of the currency's
fall rather than halt it outright.
The strength of the D-Mark raised new tensions inside Europe's ERM. The
pound dipped to a new low of DM2.7950 in London, before closing  1/4 of a
pfennig firmer on the day at DM2.8000, despite worse-than-expected UK trade
figures for July. At the close, the pound was less than 3 pfennigs above its
ERM floor against the D-Mark. In New York it was quoted at DM2.796 at the
close.
The lira was at L764.00 against the D-Mark in late New York trading, almost
touching its ERM floor of L765.00. The lira closed in London at L762.1.
