FT  25 MAR 92 / International Company News: Italian state banks suffer
declines

BANCA Commerciale Italiana and Credito Italiano, the two big public-sector
banks owned by Italy's IRI state holding company, both reported sharp falls
in profits last year due to heavy investments, higher taxation and the
non-recurrence of extraordinary items.
Net earnings at BCI slumped to L317.5bn (Dollars 215.6m) from L475.4bn in
1990, while Credito Italiano reported a marked decline in group net profits
after minority interests to L297bn from L337.6bn in 1990.
The drop in earnings at BCI stemmed partly from the lack of significant
extraordinary items, which boosted profits by L120bn in 1990. It also
reflected sharply increased spending on acquisitions and investments in the
branch network.
BCI opened 75 new branches last year and ploughed in around L300bn to buy
into or raise its existing stakes in a number of domestic and foreign
financial institutions. The most significant was the purchase of a majority
holding in the Sicily-based Banca Sicula.
The company estimated that its growth strategy trimmed earnings by L150bn
last year.
Gross operating profits climbed by 7.7 per cent to L1,138.9bn, and total
assets rose by 11.8 per cent to L117,000bn.
The dividend remains unchanged at L200 for ordinary shares and L230 for
savings stock.
The fall in net profits at Credito Italiano stemmed from a L155bn leap in
taxes to L266.4bn last year and a L15bn decline in extraordinary items to
L74bn.
The tax increase was even more marked at parent company level, with a
L182.2bn increase to L250.8bn. The bank failed to provide any explanation
for the surge.
Group operating profits rose by 18.3 per cent to L640.4bn, and the bank is
maintaining its dividend of L85 for ordinary shares and L100 for savings
stock.
Group net interest income rose by almost 16 per cent to L1,760.3bn, while
other operating income increased by 15 per cent to L1,234.4bn. Total assets
increased by 3.6 per cent to L94,347bn.
Group net profits at Banco Ambrosiano Veneto (Ambroveneto), Italy's biggest
private-sector bank, jumped by 20 per cent to L233bn last year, boosted by
strong growth in loans and deposits.
Group lending increased by 25 per cent to L18,518bn, while customer deposits
jumped by 22 per cent to L20,374bn.
The figures for Ambroveneto, which has joined other Italian banks in rapidly
expanding its branch network, were also boosted by the consolidation of
Ambroveneto Sud, the former Citibank Italia, acquired last year.
