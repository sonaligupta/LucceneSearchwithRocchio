FT  01 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: UK should not discard criminal
justice tradition


   From TERESA WYSZOMIERSKI


Sir, As a lifelong anglophile and civil libertarian, I was dismayed and
disappointed to learn that Parliament has recently acted severely to curtail
an accused subject's right against self-incrimination. British police are
now instructed to warn suspects that their failure to mention exculpatory
evidence at the time of arrest may strengthen the prosecution's case against
them.
The British government has therefore effectively discarded its criminal
justice tradition of requiring the burden of proof to rest squarely on the
heretofore broad shoulders of the Crown. In so doing, Britain diminishes its
reputation as the progenitor of many American liberties and fundamental
western values.
The US recently mourned the death of Erwin N Griswold, a former US solicitor
general and dean of Harvard Law School. During the 1950s, he courageously
defended the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination in the face
of Senator Joseph McCarthy's war on so-called 'Fifth Amendment communists' -
alleged traitors hiding behind the Bill of Rights. According to Dean
Griswold, this privilege is 'one of the great landmarks in man's long
struggle to make himself civilised'.
I implore Great Britain, as a bastion of western civilisation, seriously to
consider Dean Griswold's fine words.
