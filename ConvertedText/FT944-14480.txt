While the upsurge in the yen against the dollar discouraged investors, share
prices managed to recoup some of their early losses thanks to index buying
and the Nikkei finally closed with moderate losses, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The 225 average fell 92.82 to 19,899.08, a fraction down on the week, after
opening at a high of 19,933.79, and hitting a low of 19,784.86 in the
afternoon. Volume totalled 240m shares against 270m.
The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 9.77 to 1,578.94 while the
Nikkei 300 lost 1.79 to 288.93. Declines led advances by 738 to 250 with 186
unchanged and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 2.69 to 1,296.48
High-technology stocks were hit by the strength of the yen. NEC lost Y10 to
Y1,230 and Hitachi declined Y7 to Y990. Matsushita Electric Industrial,
which issued its Y200bn convertible bond yesterday, was hit by supply
concerns and lost Y30 to Y1,580, its fourth consecutive decline. Sega
Enterprises extended its losing streak to seven trading days, falling Y220
to Y4,630.
Drug companies were lower on reports of a cancer drug with critical side
effects, and those named in the reports plunged. Daiichi Pharmaceutical fell
Y70 to Y1,450 and Yakult lost Y80 to Y1,550.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange suspended Tsumura, a Chinese medicine manufacturer,
on reports that the company had fabricated Y1.9bn in sales over three years
to 1992. Tsumura denied the report later. Other drug issues were also hit
with Fujisawa Pharmaceutical down Y50 to Y1,060.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 129.38 to 22,141.94 in volume of 25.5m
shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, fell Y150 to Y5,300.
