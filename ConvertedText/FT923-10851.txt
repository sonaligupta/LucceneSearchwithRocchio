FT  28 JUL 92 / Little property growth indicated


   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent


RESIDUAL land values, a sensitive measure of the property industry, are
still falling in most parts of the market, according to a new survey.
The report, by Hillier Parker, the firm of chartered surveyors, showed that
residual land values in central London are from 8 per cent to 17 per cent of
their peak in 1989. It underlines the depressed state of the market and
gives little sign of an upturn.
Residual land values, which are linked to the viability of property
development, are calculated by subtracting development costs from the
capital value of a potential development. According to Hillier Parker, they
are the most sensitive indicator available. The firm says that if the values
had been calculated in the late 1980s, they would have given an early
warning of the property downturn as they led the fall in rents by up to two
years.
The study counters an assumption which stems from the lack of development
activity that residual land values are generally negative. Industrial
property and northern office parks are the only sectors that have negative
residual land values.
Residual industrial land values have been negative for most of the past
seven years, as rents never reached the point where development was
profitable. As a result there is little stock to hold back rents when the
economy recovers.
Residual land values have started to increase in the industrial sector,
though rents have not yet improved.
In the retail warehouse sector, the only other part of the market to show an
increase in residual land values, rents have already increased.
