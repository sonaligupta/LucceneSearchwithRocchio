FT  06 NOV 93 / Uruguay Round of World Trade Talks


   By DAVID DODWELL


Sir Leon Brittan, the European Community's trade commissioner, yesterday
called for countries negotiating the Uruguay Round of world trade talks to
enter 'a market-opening race in efforts to leap-frog the offers of other
countries', writes David Dodwell.
He told members of the American Chamber of Commerce in London that the
difficulties now facing negotiators 'are formidable - and success is in no
way guaranteed'.
Arguing that the Uruguay Round settlement was 'not just a series of deals,
but a more rational way of handling world trade', Sir Leon called for the
leap-frogging race to ensure success ahead of the December 15 deadline for
completion of the talks.
He conceded that a 'leap-frogging race' would have to be conducted privately
if it were to succeed.
