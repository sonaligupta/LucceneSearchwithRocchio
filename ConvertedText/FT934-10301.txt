FT  05 NOV 93 / International Company News: Swiss Re plans 'option' rights

SWISS Reinsurance, the world's second largest reinsurance group after Munich
Reinsurance, is raising up to SFr700m (Dollars 466m) in 1994 and 1995
through option-based rights issues.
These would be in addition to the previously announced 1-for-10 rights issue
later this year to raise SFr575m.
Mr Arnold Saxer, chairman, said that the funds were needed to strengthen the
group's capital base, whose growth was not keeping pace with that of premium
income.
'These capital-raising plans are important. We would not undertake them if
we did not have confidence in the future,' Mr Saxer said.
He forecast that 1993 net income would be at least 10 per cent higher than
last year's SFr281m. Premium income was expected to rise 15 per cent. Last
year, premium income was up 25.6 per cent to SFr21.9bn.
Losses from catastrophes were expected to be lower this year and income was
being boosted by premium rate increases in the accident and liability areas.
The capital raising for 1994 and 1995 is by way of two sets of options that
will be given to shareholders, one exerciseable until the end of 1994, the
other until the end of 1995.
The options will be distributed on the basis of one option of each type per
bearer or registered share held following imminent 5-for-1 splits. Every 20
options will entitle the holder to purchase one registered share from the
group treasury at a price to be fixed on November 24.
This year's conventional rights issue is on the basis of one new bearer or
registered share for every 10 shares (post splits) or participation
certificates. The price, expected to be about SFr475 a share, will be set on
November 24.
Movenpick, the Swiss restaurant and hotels group, said its sales in the
first nine months rose 3.7 per cent and it anticipated a 30 per cent rise in
1993 net income over last year's depressed SFr6.5m.
