FT  20 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Acquisition helps Nobo to Pounds 2.5m


Nobo Group yesterday announced a near-doubling of pre-tax profits, from
Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 2.5m, for the year to April 30.
The manufacturer of office and business products said the increase, achieved
on turnover ahead 25 per cent to Pounds 26.3m (Pounds 21.1m), was partly due
to the acquisition in September of Elite Optics for Pounds 3m. Elite
contributed Pounds 325,000 to operating profits of Pounds 2.87m (Pounds
1.75m) from turnover of Pounds 3.16m.
Earnings per share jumped 91 per cent from 8.15p to 15.59p. A proposed final
dividend of 4p makes a total of 6p (4.8p).
