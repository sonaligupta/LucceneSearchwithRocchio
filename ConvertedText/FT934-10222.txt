FT  06 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Burtonwood Brewery rises 29%


PRE-TAX profits of Pounds 1.97m were yesterday reported by Burtonwood
Brewery for the six months to September 25 1993, a 29 per cent increase on
the Pounds 1.53m last time.
The outcome was achieved on turnover of Pounds 26m (Pounds 25.7m) and was
struck after a Pounds 206,000 (Pounds 36,000) loss on asset disposals and
net interest payable of Pounds 387,000 (Pounds 499,000).
Earnings per share came out at 6p (4.8p) and the interim dividend is
maintained at 0.7p per share.
The company said the purchase of additional licensed premises had
contributed to increased profitability. An improved performance from the
retail division had also had a significant impact.
