commercial vehicles

GENERAL Motors of the US, the world's largest vehicle maker, has formed a
joint venture in China for the production of light commercial vehicles.
The venture, which will be GM's first vehicle project in China, will have an
equity capital of Dollars 33m (Pounds 18.5m). Total investment by the joint
venture is expected to be Dollars 100m by the end of the decade.
The US vehicle maker is taking a 30 per cent stake in Jinbei GM Automotive
Company, a joint venture formed with Jinbei Automobile, a producer of vans
and light duty trucks.
The new company, which is to employ 5,000 people at Shenyang City, 700 km
north-east of Beijing, will start assembly of GM's North American S-series
pick-up trucks later this year. GM said yesterday that output would increase
gradually in the 1990s to reach some 50,000 a year by 1998.
At first, the trucks will be assembled from semi-knockdown kits shipped from
North America, but GM said that it would gradually increase local content by
using a rising share of locally supplied parts.
The engine plant is planned to have an eventual capacity to produce 200,000
units a year.
Initially 2.5 litre engines for the pick-up trucks to be assembled by Jinbei
GM Automotive will be supplied from North America, but these will gradually
be replaced by engines from the Bei Nei plant.
GM is to provide management personnel, training, and technology to the joint
venture company.
