FT  19 APR 94 / UK Company News: Johnson Fry Pounds 12.5m in red after
restructuring


   By SIMON DAVIES


Johnson Fry, the financial services and investment group, incurred a pre-tax
loss of Pounds 12.5m in 1993 due to the impact of asset sales and a radical
restructuring, but showed a sharp improvement in operating profits.
The company sold its LIT America business last July, resulting in a book
loss of Pounds 7.8m, and a Pounds 19.8m goodwill write-down.
Total exceptional losses amounted to Pounds 22.7m in 1993, obscuring
operating profits of Pounds 12.2m, which compared with Pounds 2.8m in 1992.
As a leading sponsor of business expansion schemes, Johnson Fry benefited
from the spurt of interest before such schemes were phased out at the end of
1993.
It raised Pounds 486m for the schemes last year, generating gross profit of
Pounds 15.8m, up from Pounds 6.6m. This income will not recur.
Last year was a watershed for the group, which had started 1993 as LIT
Holdings, the heavily indebted parent company of the lossmaking LIT America
business.
Following the Dollars 23.6m (Pounds 16.1m) sale of LIT America and the
radical capital reconstruction, it now has a profitable core business,
negligible long-term debt, and a market capitalisation increased from Pounds
3m to Pounds 45m.
Johnson Fry Property now has a Pounds 903m portfolio, resulting from BES
property schemes, and this will contribute management fees during the 5 year
lives of the funds. It contributed Pounds 2.24m (Pounds 982,000) in 1993.
The investment management side made Pounds 1.08m (Pounds 372,000). Fees
should rise this year, as it gets a full year contribution from its two
utilities investment trusts, and other new products.
The company will consider the resumption of dividends next year. Losses per
share in 1993 came to 103.1p (8.1p).
COMMENT
What a difference a year makes. Johnson Fry is now a cash rich company on
the look-out for opportunities to expand by acquisition, when a year earlier
it was a financial wreck. But last year's outcome gives little sense of
itsfinancial strength, not just because of the restructuring, but because of
BES. Brokers expect pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.5m in 1994, putting the
shares on a p/e of 11.5. A discount to the sector is justified, given the
lack of a meaningful track record, but after falling 5 per cent to 283p
yesterday, the shares offer speculative value.
