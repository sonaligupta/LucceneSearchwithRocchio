FT  28 SEP 94 / People: Fallon's post with mail order


Ivan Fallon, the former deputy editor of the Sunday Times who specialises in
writing biographies of wealthy businessmen, is joining the board of N Brown,
Sir David Alliance's family-controlled mail order business.
Fallon, 51, stepped down as business editor of the Sunday Times a few months
ago and is about to take up a senior executive position with the Argus
Group, the South African newspaper company in which Tony O'Reilly's
Independent Newspaper group is the biggest investor. Fallon, who was City
editor of the Sunday Telegraph from 1979 to 1984 and deputy editor of the
Sunday Times for nearly ten years, has made a speciality of getting to know
rich and famous business folk.
His books include The Brothers: the rise and fall of Saatchi and Saatchi and
Billionaire, the life and times of Sir James Goldsmith. His biography of
Tony O'Reilly, The Player, is published tomorrow.
The second youngest of six brothers, Fallon comes from an Irish literary
family. His father was a poet and playwright and Ivan's younger brother,
Padraic, also an ex-journalist, is now chairman of Euromoney Publications
and a non-executive director of Allied Irish Banks.
Sir David Alliance, 62, who arrived in Britain in the 1950s as a poor
immigrant from Tehran, has grown into Britain's biggest textiles magnate. He
is best known as chairman of Coats Viyella but it has been the strong
performance of N Brown, a Manchester-based home shopping group, which
provides the bulk of an estimated family fortune of Pounds 200m.
Sir David does not expect Fallon's new job in South Africa to interfere with
his new duties as a non-executive director of N Brown. However, it sounds as
if Fallon will be too busy to pen Sir David's biography - even though he is
tempted. 'It's a fascinating story,' says Fallon.
