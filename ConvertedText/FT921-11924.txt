FT  29 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Attempt to block AEU merger


   By CHRIS TIGHE


A CAMPAIGN to block the merger of the AEU engineering union and the EETPU
electricians' union on the terms currently proposed has been launched by two
AEU members, Chris Tighe writes.
Mr George Arnold and Mr Len Edmondson, both retired AEU national executive
members, fear the union's election of officials and traditions of
affiliation to the Trades Union Congress may be undermined by a merger.
Leaders of the AEU and EETPU say that, if the merger is approved in the
ballot, a further vote will be held within a year on whether the combined
union should affiliate to the TUC.
With the support of some branch officials in the north-east, where the AEU
is strongly represented, Mr Arnold and Mr Edmondson held a meeting of
members last night in Gateshead to urge them to vote against the merger.
Mr Arnold, a former chairman of the TUC's northern area, said yesterday that
they were not against the principle of the merger, but were concerned about
the plan not to ballot members on TUC affiliation until after the merger.
'As far as we're concerned, the rules of our union say we should be in the
TUC,' said Mr Arnold. 'I believe in one union for the engineering industry,
but I also believe in one trade union organisation for the country.'
Mr Arnold believes the EETPU, expelled from the TUC in 1988 for failing to
obey a ruling to withdraw from single-union deals, should seek to resume
affiliation before any amalgamation. Ideally he would like the vote
postponed, but a 'no' vote would force reconsideration of the issue.
Many union members, he said, shared his concern at the haste with which the
merger was being pursued.
In spite of the opposition, the vote in the merger ballot is expected to be
decisively in favour. Voting begins next week, with the result expected in
early March.
