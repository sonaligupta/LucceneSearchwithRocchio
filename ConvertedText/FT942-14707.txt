FT  19 APR 94 / UK Company News: Sharp setback for Densitron Intl


In line with its warning in January, Densitron International yesterday
reported a sharp setback in annual profits.
The Kent-based electronic components group blamed the decline over the 1993
year - from Pounds 1m, restated for a change in the treatment of goodwill,
to Pounds 606,000 pre-tax - on a substantial contractual problem and
disappointing sales in the US.
Turnover improved 27 per cent to Pounds 67.9m (Pounds 53.3m) although
directors stressed that the increase was largely attributable to currency
influences. 'In reality sales were essentially flat and while there was a
small increase in gross margin, there was a large enough real rise in costs
to reduce the outcome,' they added.
The proposed final dividend is maintained at 1p, making 1.5p (1.4p) for the
year, barely covered by earnings of 1.54p (3.89p) per share.
