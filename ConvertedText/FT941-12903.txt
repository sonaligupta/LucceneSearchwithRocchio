FT  27 JAN 94 / International Company News: Oerlikon-Buhrle buys Degussa
vacuum unit

   ZURICH


Oerlikon-Buhrle, the Swiss armaments, engineering and retail group, has
agreed to purchase the Leybold vacuum technology businesses from Degussa of
Frankfurt for DM100m (Dollars 59m).
The deal, subject to clearance by the German cartel authorities, would make
Buhrle, whose Balzers subsidiary has a large vacuum business, a leading
supplier in this specialised field.
Vacuum systems are used for coating various products, including
architectural glass, semiconductor wafers, compact disks, erasable optical
disks and liquid crystal displays.
Balzers had turnover of SFr430m (Dollars 287m) last year and was profitable.
Leybold, with sales of DM868m, has been in heavy loss for some time.
Mr Heinrich Fischer, Buhrle's corporate development director, said the two
together had a large share of the German market, but that was no reason to
block the deal. Last week Buhrle revealed it had placed 362,500 registered
shares privately in December at market value to help finance the
acquisition.
