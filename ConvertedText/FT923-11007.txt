The two-week old government of Polish Prime Minister Hanna Suchocka is to
ask for powers to rule by decree to improve the efficiency of government
work, the PAP news agency reported yesterday, AP reports from Warsaw.
President Lech Walesa discussed the question with Mr Suchocka after
religious ceremonies in the Baltic port of Gdansk. The decrees are expected
to allow the government to bypass the lower house of parliament, which is
faced with an overwhelming backlog of vital economic legislation.
