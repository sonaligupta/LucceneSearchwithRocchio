FT  10 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading


   By PETER JOHN


HOPES of an early interest rate cut led to volatility in financial futures
yesterday, and strength in the derivative markets acted as a subsequent spur
to the underlying cash market, writes Peter John.
Belief that the US would cut its discount rate and the hope that this would
relieve pressure in Europe encouraged buyers of the March contract. Dealers
noted strong early buying from a Japanese house.
The interest ensured that March, which had been coming closer to its fair
value - the premium which allows for dividend flow and financing costs on
the underlying Footsie stocks - moved upwards and, at one stage, was some 49
points above cash or 20 higher than fair value.
A number of dealers had been going short and were squeezed by the steadily
rising price of the contract. March reached the day's high late in the
session but then a seller brought it back to 2,542 for the official close.
On the LTOM, turnover leapt from recent desultory volumes to a respectable
32,800 contracts, above the market's perceived break-even point of 30,000.
Late dealing ensured that Grand Metropolitan was the most heavily dealt
stock option with turnover of 2,694 lots.
