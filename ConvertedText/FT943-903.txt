FT  27 SEP 94 / Observer: A rash move?


So Philip Jarrold, 44, managing director of Peaudouce, the nappy
manufacturer, is moving to head Ladbroke's Vernons pools division. This
should give hacks in the trade press a chance to test their headline writing
skills. How about 'Forty-four and finally out of nappies', or 'Jarrold
arrives at Vernons with reputation unsoiled'. Observer's suggestion is 'From
the bottom to the top' but a real pro could do much better.
