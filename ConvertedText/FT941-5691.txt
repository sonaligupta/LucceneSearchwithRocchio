FT  04 MAR 94 / Survey of World Tyre Industry (5): Pressure still high -
Problems facing European manufacturers


   By JOHN GRIFFITHS


Europe's tyre industry will look back on the early 1990s as one of the most
difficult periods in its history, according to Mr Carlo Banchieri,
deputy-chairman of Pirelli Tyre Holding. Market conditions and pressures on
profit margins are certainly the toughest that he can recall in some 30
years spent in the industry.
Mr Banchieri's sentiments are echoed among executives of other leading
European tyre groups, who see little prospect of the pressures easing in
1994. 'Anyone looking for a place to rest is making a terrible mistake,'
says Mr Bill Sharp, president and general manager of Goodyear's European
operations. 'This has become an industry where there is no finish line.'
Since the late 1980s, intensive efforts have resulted in slashed costs and
increased efficiency, under pressure from vehicle makers, themselves
desperate to reduce costs. They have been seemingly bent on paring the tyre
industry's margins on original equipment supplies to the bone. 'We are
requested to assure price reductions for one, two, three years in a brutal
way. And the tools with which cost reductions can be achieved have already
been used,' says Mr Banchieri.
If there is some consolation, he suggests, it is that there is emerging a
greater sense of understanding of each other's problems between vehicle and
tyre makers which bodes well for the future once the present near-crisis in
Europe's motor industry is past. 'The transparency between the motor
industry and us as suppliers is much greater than in the past.'
Little more than 12 months ago, almost the entire European industry, already
much slimmed down since 1990, thought its problems were ending and that the
region would make a steady recovery from recession. Instead, with the
exception of the UK Europe's vehicles markets underwent their steepest
collapse since the second world war.
New car sales finished 1993 nearly 15 per cent lower than in the previous
year; truck sales fell by nearly 30 per cent. And as some of the threads of
the European monetary system unravelled, so did the industry's hopes of
establishing stable pan-European pricing and manufacturing policies.
Inevitably, the collapse of demand in the original equipment sector has
served to increase price competition in the numerically much larger
replacement tyre market, where margins are typically higher. It is in this
replacement market that most of the industry's profits are made. Thus the
industry's partially successful efforts to raise replacement market prices
in 1992 have been largely negated, and it has only recently begun to try
again. It is not, however, looking to any substantial market growth this
year.
Michelin, Goodyear and Pirelli all believe that the decline in vehicle sales
has halted - borne out by slightly higher sales in January - but that any
upturn this year will be small. Truck sales may grow by as much as 7-8 per
cent after last year's precipitous drop, says Goodyear's Mr Sharp, but car
sales are unlikely to rise by more than two or three per cent.
Against this background, the industry is operating at only around 80 per
cent of capacity in Europe, even after a number of rationalisations and
cutbacks by all the leading participants.
Adding to its worries are the growing level of cheap imports from outside
western Europe, mainly from Asia and eastern Europe. These now account for
about 25 per cent of Europe's total 215m units a year tyre market - up from
around 15 per cent a few years ago, and underline the industry's concern
about the relatively high total labour costs of producing in Europe when EU
'Social Chapter' provisions are included. Nevertheless, 'we can't wait for
someone else to fix our problems', says Goodyear's Mr Sharp.
Thus the past year has seen Goodyear rationalise heavily within Europe,
closing its Brussels headquarters, moving its core management team back to
the parent HQ in Akron, Ohio, and other key 'hands-on' staff to its
principal technical centre and manufacturing operations in Colmar-Berg,
Luxembourg. One plant near Heidelberg has also been closed. Michelin,
Europe's market leader, is in the middle of a big drive to take FFr3.5bn
(Dollars 580m) out of its costs by the end of this year, involving job cuts
totalling nearly 6,000 at plants in Europe. This follows a FFr3bn
cost-cutting programme in 1991 and 92.  Michelin executives say these
actions are helping lift productivity by around 5 per cent a year.
Continental, the big German tyre maker, has its tyre manufacturing well
spread around Europe and thus has not been too hard hit by the relative
strength of the D-Mark and Germany's now notoriously high labour costs.
Corporate strategy is to continue to concentrate Continental's premier tyre
development and manufacturing inside Germany, but to take advantage of lower
production cost plants elsewhere in Europe for more mass market products.
Even so, more than 2,000 jobs went last year and its tyre distribution
operations have been heavily rationalised. Pirelli, still feeling the
lingering effects of its attempted takeover of Continental, has closed
plants in Italy and Greece, and cut back manufacturing operations in the UK.
However, the situation is far from one of unrelieved gloom.
Messrs Banchieri, Sharp and others in the industry maintain that a flurry of
new products is offering the potential for higher margins in the replacement
market, and that some at least of the price increases likely to be
introduced this year can be made to stick.
Much of the new product, such as Goodyear's Aquatred rain tyres and
Pirelli's P5000 Vizzola, is pitched at premium aftermarket sectors, where
private customers are prepared to pay extra for specific performance
attributes.
But there is also a concerted drive by the big participants to compete more
effectively in the cheaper sector of the market under increasing threat from
imports.
Thus there is increasing use of second or third tier brand names owned by
the majors, and which can be sold more cheaply without devaluing the
'flagship' brand's image. Thus Pirelli, for example, is using its Ceat and
Courier labels to broaden its market presence, while Michelin has introduced
Tiremaster and Goodyear is making greater use of its Lee and Kelly brand
names.
Taken together, the various actions are expected to sustain the European
industry in its present shape, with no more significant mergers or
acquisitions, over the next difficult two years.
After that, industry leaders see some of the pressures easing and capacity
utilisation much improved. 'Three years out from now, there should be a good
balance,' concludes Goodyear's Mr Sharp.
