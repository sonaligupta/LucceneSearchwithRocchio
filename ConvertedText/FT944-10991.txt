Gadjah Tunggal and its subsidiary Andayani Megah, two large Indonesian tyre
and tyre cord manufacturers, said their unaudited net income in the nine
months ending September 30 rose by 93 per cent and 45 per cent respectively,
writes Manuela Saragosa in Jakarta.
Gadjah Tunggal's earnings for the period climbed to Rp66bn (Dollars 30.38m)
from Rp34bn a year ago. Andayani Megah's net income totalled Rp24bn, up from
Rp16.5bn a year ago.
Both companies reported their revenues rose by about 28 per cent.
Indonesia's tyre industry is protected by high tariffs.
