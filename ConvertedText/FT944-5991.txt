FT  01 DEC 94 / Police 'behind' on laundering probes


Police were unable to cope with reports of suspected money laundering from
bank and building societies last year, even before tighter reporting
requirements were introduced under the Criminal Justice Act, a Police
Foundation study has found.
The study said that staffing limitations at the National Criminal
Intelligence Service meant that the 12,736 reports of possible money
laundering received last year did not receive due attention and
investigation.
City of London police said changes had been made since the study. A backlog
of reports was due to be cleared soon.
