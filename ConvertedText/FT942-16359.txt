FT  11 APR 94 / Observer: A peer into Orwell


When will Britain's leading Tories stop trying to recruit George Orwell to
the cause of sentimental English nationalism?
First, the prime minister quoted Orwell's evocation of a slumbering England
of warm beer and '. . . old maids biking to Holy Communion through the mist'
in a St George's Day speech last year to the Conservative Group for Europe.
Now we have employment secretary David Hunt, in a recent pamphlet on
Conservatism and the Social Market, quoting Orwell on 'the gentleness of the
English civilisation' and that 'England resembles a family'.
But the point about Orwell is that he did not want his English readers to
wallow in complacent self-congratulation. Just before Orwell's biking maids,
for example, come the 'queues outside the labour exchanges'. And the
gentleness which Hunt finds so appealing was, to Orwell, 'mixed up with
barbarities and anachronisms'.
The selectivity of the quote about England resembling a family is even more
crass. As Orwell's The Lion and the Unicorn (subtitled Socialism and the
English Genius), makes clear, England is 'a family with the wrong members in
control'. A phrase that might, indeed, sound rather chilling to the most
unpopular Conservative government this century.
