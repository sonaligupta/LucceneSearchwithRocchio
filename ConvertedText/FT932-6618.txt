FT  27 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Storehouse calls off its plans to sell
loss-maker


   By NEIL BUCKLEY


STOREHOUSE, the UK retailing group whose principal interests are the BhS and
Mothercare chains, said yesterday it had abandoned plans to sell the
loss-making Blazer menswear chain because the offers had been too low.
Blazer, which incurred a Pounds 600,000 operating loss last year, was the
final 'non-core' business Storehouse was attempting to sell, following the
disposal of the Habitat and Richards chains last year and the end of its
Oppidan property joint venture in March.
Mr Graham Rider, finance director, said that while several offers to buy
Blazer had been received, they would have represented a bigger book loss
than the board was prepared to accept.
He added Blazer would still be classified 'non-core', as it did not have the
potential to be a mass-market business like BhS or Storehouse. But it was
essentially sound, and Storehouse believed it had a number of ideas that
could return it to profit.
'There are certain things we know need putting right within the business
which we did not do while it was up for sale, but we will now be looking
at,' he said.
