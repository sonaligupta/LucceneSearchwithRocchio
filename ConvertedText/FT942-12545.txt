FT  29 APR 94 / World Trade News: JAL in Dollars 280m Boeing deal

Boeing, the US aircraft manufacturer, has won an order from Japan Airlines
to supply it with up to seven 737-400 short-haul aircraft in a deal worth
about Dollars 280m (Pounds 191.70m).
JAL said the aircraft would meet its new domestic service requirements and
help improve local business prospects.
The 150-seat aircraft will be fitted with engines from GE, the US company.
The Boeing 737-400 is the latest version of the twin-jet with a high-tech
cockpit operated by a two-man flight crew. JAL expects to receive the first
aircraft in June.
Airbus Industries in Paris said that the European consortium, which has been
trying to increase sales in Japan, had not been invited to make a proposal
for JAL's needs. Airbus has a short-haul aircraft, the A320, and recently
won an order for 20 such planes from All Nippon Airways, Japan's second
largest airline.
JAL, however, has a history of buying Boeing jets. 'After an in-house study
of small-capacity airliners, the decision went to the Boeing jet, which fits
JAL's requirements regarding performance, operational economy and
reliability,' the company said.
JAL's subsidiary based in Okinawa has already ordered the Boeing 737-400,
enabling the two airlines to co-operate in parts purchases, maintenance and
pilot training.
