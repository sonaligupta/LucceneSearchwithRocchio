FT  13 APR 94 / Party is criticised over local tax comparisons


   By GRAHAM BOWLEY


An independent economic think-tank yesterday joined the row between Labour
and the Conservatives about local taxation, saying that Labour's comparison
of council tax bills was misleading.
The Institute for Fiscal Studies said that Labour's calculations, which
compare average tax bills under different councils, were less fair than
government figures. It said they confused the rate of tax charged to each
taxpayer and the value of the property on which the tax was based.
Government figures, based on the charge paid by taxpayers in a particular
tax band, provided a fairer comparison across councils, it said.
Mr Stephen Smith, deputy director of the institute said: 'Labour's figures
are misleading. The average bill may be higher not because of higher charges
but because the average house is worth more.
'Labour councils are often in areas with low value property, which means
that as long as they are spending at the standard rate set by the government
they will receive grants to enable them to meet their spending requirements
without having to raise taxes.
'The average bill therefore often tells you more about the value of property
in an area and the size of the central government grant an authority is
receiving than about the tax burden it is imposing.'
He said the government's method of comparing rates for a particular tax band
provided a more reasonable reflection of taxation behaviour by local
governments.
He added that average tax bill comparisons become worthwhile when
authorities begin to spend above the standard rate, because then they must
start raising taxes to meet spending requirements.
