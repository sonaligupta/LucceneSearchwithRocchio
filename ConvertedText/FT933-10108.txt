   ATHENS


Greek Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis was forced yesterday to back off
from presenting a bill to privatise the state telephone company after
members of his conservative party threatened to vote against the sale,
Reuter reports from Athens.
Mr Mitsotakis said: 'The draft bill is not ready yet and I can't tell you
when it will be tabled in parliament.' Earlier government officials had said
the bill would be presented this week and voted on by August 12.
