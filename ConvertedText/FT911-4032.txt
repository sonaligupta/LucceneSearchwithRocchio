FT  22 APR 91 / International Company News: Actimo to buy Canadian chain

ACTIMO, a private French property group, plans to buy Pascal, the Canadian
hardware chain which is in receivership, for an undisclosed price.
Furniture and hotel supply businesses which also operate under the Pascal
name will remain in the hands of the Pascal family. The hardware business
had annual sales of CDollars 200m (USDollars 173m) before running into
trouble last year. Varity, the Canadian car parts, diesel engine and farm
equipment group, says existing shareholders will retain all their rights
when it moves headquarters from Toronto to the US later this year.
Varity will set up a US holding company, Varity Corp, registered in
Delaware, but with headquarters in Buffalo, NY. The assets of the existing
Canadian company will be amalgamated with the new company and the Canadian
company will be wound up.
