FT  27 MAY 93 / What the white paper sets out


Government to harness science, technology and engineering more closely to
wealth creation.
No promise of new funds for R&D but 'government will continue to allocate
public resources on the scale necessary to finance the policies in this
white paper'.
Technology foresight, conducted jointly by the government, academics and
industry, to assess spending priorities.
Advisory Council on Science and Technology becomes the more powerful Council
for Science and Technology.
Department of Trade and Industry refocuses innovation budget to help small
and medium-sized companies gain access to technology.
Science and Engineering Research Council split into an Engineering and
Physical Sciences Research Council, and a Particle Physics and Astronomy
Research Council. Agricultural and Food Research Council to be Biotechnology
and Biological Sciences Research Council.
Advisory Board for the Research Councils absorbed within government's Office
of Science and Technology. Director-general of research councils to be
appointed.
Dual-funding system maintained for supporting university research.
Government research establishments reviewed, with a view to opening them up
to competition. Some may be privatised and others may be closed.
Postgraduate training reformed 'so that the MSc can become the normal
initial postgraduate degree'. Fewer students will go on to a PhD.
More openness, with individual departmental mission statements widely
disseminated and a Forward Look published every year to give a clear
statement of government R&D strategy.
