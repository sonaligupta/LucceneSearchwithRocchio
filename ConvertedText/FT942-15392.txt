FT  15 APR 94 / People: Well-matched company


From secretary to commercial director in nine years is no mean feat; but
then to return voluntarily to being a personal assistant and, once more,
rising to the top ranks of yet another company is a rare achievement.
Jan Reynolds, below, has just been appointed managing director of Octavius
Hunt, part of the Chemring group since 1991.
The UK's last remaining match manufacturer, Octavius Hunt is based in
Bristol, from where it produces a variety of specialist pyrotechnical and
smoke equipment for such diverse entities as the ministry of defence and
banana importers.
Reynolds, 51, spent almost 10 years with Pollastrip, then part of the Tarmac
group, rising from secretarial status in 1980 to be commercial director by
the time she left in 1989.
'Having become disillusioned with being part of a large organisation I
decided to go back to being a personal assistant for a smaller operation,'
she says.
She then joined Octavius Hunt in 1989 as personal assistant to Derek
Luffingham, who then owned the company. Within a year, she was once more a
director; she now replaces Tom Davies - who is taking on a broader role
within the Chemring group - as managing director, running the company.
No disillusionment this time round, either: 'Rather, I feel a bit like the
people in the latest British Gas ads, who say they just love being in
control.'
With the company just recently launching into the retail and display
fireworks' market, Reynolds is likely to find much to spark further
interest.
