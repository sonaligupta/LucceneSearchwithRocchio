FT  22 JUL 93 / International Company News: Colgate rises 14% to Dollars
142m


   By MARTIN DICKSON


COLGATE-Palmolive, the US consumer products group, yesterday reported a 14
per cent increase in second-quarter earnings, despite weak economic
conditions in most of the developed world.
The company had net income of Dollars 142.4m, or 86 cents a share, compared
with Dollars 124.4m, or 75 cents, in the same period of last year. Sales
dipped 1 per cent to Dollars 1.78bn, due to currency fluctuations, though
unit volume was steady with a year earlier.
Mr Reuben Mark, chairman, said the earnings increase was due to the
company's commitment to increased profit margins. This had been achieved by
reducing overheads, streamlining worldwide manufacturing, and 'the continued
shift of product mix to our more profitable product categories'.
The gross profit margin rose from 47.1 per cent to 48 per cent, and the
after-tax return on sales moved up from 6.9 per cent to 8 per cent.
The company's biggest business - oral, personal and household care -
achieved 'healthy sales advances' in the developing world, which helped
offset decreases in the mature economies. Latin American sales were up 11
per cent.
Although European sales from this segment fell 10 per cent because of poor
economic conditions and currency factors, operating profit percentages
improved thanks to restructuring. US sales were down 4 per cent in unit
terms and 6 per cent in dollar terms.
However, Colgate said this was a considerable improvement on the first
quarter.
