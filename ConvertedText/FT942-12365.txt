FT  29 APR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool


Australia's official market indicator ended the week at 568 cents a kg., 6
cents lower than a week ago. Prices eased at the first sales of the week on
April 26, but since then the market has tended to become firmer again, and
auction clearances improved. The other main auction this week was held in
Bradford with British wool on offer. This too saw the market firm and at
times slightly dearer, but there was no definite upward trend. Some coarser
carpet wools met with practically no interest at prices acceptable to the
marketing board, adding to the impression that earlier pressures from
oversold firms have lessened. The main selling season in Australia now has
only two months to run, and from July 1 Stockpile wool will be sold
according to fixed schedule.
