FT  30 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: The real Europe for real people


   From Mr GEORGE THOMAS


Sir, Your editorial 'Germany's Europe' (April 28) marks the FT as the last
bastion of those who believe that 'the over-mighty sovereign Germany', as
you put it, can be tamed by absorption into a united Europe. You then go on
to describe this ideal Europe as one in which the many peoples of Europe,
mollified by full bellies and material prosperity, will accept the dominance
of Germany as a fair price for pacification of the monster.
But real people are political and tribal. Real people, even rich ones if we
could always hope to be rich, have aspirations to at least the sense of a
say in their governance. When in a minority they need national loyalty to
accept their disappointment and tolerate laws they dislike. Europe,
particularly one dominated by one country, cannot meet these demands. This
may be bad for business but it is true and for this reason the Europe that
you wish for will not continue to be the 'zone of stability' that we have
come to accept so complacently and which you choose to abandon so
recklessly. Your Europe will be as fractious, unruly and tense as any
previous colonial empire.
