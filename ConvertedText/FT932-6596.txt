FT  27 MAY 93 / International Company News: Compaq sees strong second
quarter result


   By JEREMY BENNALLACK-HART


COMPAQ Computer expects a strong second-quarter performance.
Mr Andreas Barth, senior vice-president, Europe, said his forecast was based
on the first signs of economic recovery in Europe and the surge in demand
generated by the introduction of the 486SL-based Compaq Contura and Compaq
LTE Lite notebook ranges in March and May.
First-quarter net income, reported last month, jumped to Dollars 102m, or
Dollars 1.23 a share, from Dollars 45m, or 53 cents, on revenues 106 per
cent higher at Dollars 1.6bn.
The company confirmed in a statement that it took the lead in the European
portable PC market for the first time in the quarter. The group held a 22
per cent market share in value terms and a 17.5 per cent market share in
unit terms, according to Dataquest, a market research business.
