FT  20 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Commission fights against
dilution of CAP reforms


   By DAVID GARDNER

THE European Commission and the current Portuguese presidency of the EC were
last night still locked in negotiations as Brussels sought to resist
dilution of its planned reform of the Common Agricultural Policy by farm
ministers of the Twelve.
Hard bargaining between Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, and
Mr Arlindo Cunha, the Portuguese agriculture minister currently heading the
farm council, delayed resumption of the ministerial meeting, which broke off
on Monday afternoon for bilateral negotiations the Commission and Presidency
held with each member state.
The cause of the impasse was last month's fourth attempt by the presidency
to strike a compromise, which suggested lowering cereals prices to only
Ecu112 a tonne, or by 27 per cent from current prices, against the Ecu100
per tonne sought by the Commission - a 35 per cent drop.
Because the cereals chapter is the core of the MacSharry reform, he was said
by aides last night to have dug in his heels and refused to budge. One
source said a likely new compromise was Ecu110 per tonne.
Germany wants a far less severe reduction in price than even the Portuguese
compromise, while France fears that if the price does not come down far
enough, its competitive grains exporters will be hit by greater 'set-aside'
requirements to restrain production.
A new compromise paper was expected late last night, to enable ministers not
only to judge the cereals price target, but to a range of tightly knotted
problems to be resolved in the livestock and dairy sectors.
These cannot be given full consideration until the cereals issue is
resolved, since the lower cost of grain as feedstock is part of the
compensation promised livestock farmers for also accepting severe price
cuts.
With the Council of Ministers as such not sitting for all but a few minutes
of the first 36 hours of a meeting which could run all week, there was doubt
that the agreement in principle on the reform package the Commission and
Presidency were seeking this week could be reached.
