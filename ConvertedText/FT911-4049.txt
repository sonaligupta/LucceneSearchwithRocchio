FT  22 APR 91 / Letter: Capital gains tax of no concern to grim reaper


   From Mr PHILIP CHAPPELL


Sir, Your leader 'Housing and inflation' (April 16) accurately describes the
mess that we politely call a policy for housing finance - a mess that is
typical of the shambles, in both the modern and the slaughter-house meaning,
that pervades all our policies towards personal saving and investment.
But you should not fall into the trap of suggesting any form of capital
gains tax on equity withdrawal from owner-occupied housing. The case for
roll-over relief is well made: but since the grim reaper does not normally
give as much as seven years notice of his plans, most owner-occupiers will
die with their estate owning a house, a highly visible asset. On death, the
tentacles of inheritance tax (which makes no allowance for purely
inflationary gains on savings) wrap up any tax advantages that capital gains
tax exemption may have offered during life.
Take away mortgage interest relief and the tax treatment of housing then
provides the ideal for taxing all forms of saving, on the personal equity
plan/tax-exempt special savings accounts precedent. All investment is made
out of after-tax income and thereafter accumulates free of all income taxes
and gains taxes, until death levels us all. The Inland Revenue can sleep
content in the sure knowledge that we are all under sentence of death,
albeit with a temporary reprieve.
