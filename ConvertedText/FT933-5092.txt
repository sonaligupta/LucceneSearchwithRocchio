FT  06 SEP 93 / Row over Ukraine's N-pledge

   MOSCOW


OPPOSITION is growing to Ukraine's agreement to sell its half of the Black
Sea Fleet, and to return its nuclear warheads, to Russia.
The agreement, announced by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk and Russian
President Boris Yeltsin after talks on Friday, was denounced by a Ukrainian
minister, Mr Valery Shmarov.
It was described by a deputy premier as 'nothing short of a disaster' and by
Mr Vyacheslav Chornovil, head of the nationalist opposition party Rukh, as
'high treason'.
Mr Kravchuk himself partly defended, partly denied, his alleged agreement to
the deal. General Konstantin Morozov, defence minister, said yesterday that
no agreement on the sale of the Ukrainian fleet had yet been concluded. Mr
Kravchuk stressed that details of both the sale of the fleet and the
transfer of the warheads had to be worked out by joint commissions.
Mr Yeltsin said after the meeting that the cost of the fleet would be set
against an estimated Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.65bn) which Kiev owes to Moscow
for oil and gas supplies.
