FT  24 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Dorrell highlights privatisation


   By ALISON SMITH


ONLY the inescapable core of government should remain in the public sector,
Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, said yesterday,
Alison Smith writes.
Mr Dorrell said that should be the approach to privatisation schemes for the
future. He also urged businesses to propose schemes for co-operation between
the private and public sectors. The key question in considering joint
capital projects was, he said, whether the private sector was genuinely
assuming risk.
Addressing the Centre for Policy Studies, the rightwing think tank, he said
that in looking at possible privatisations, the question was no longer 'what
can we sell?' but 'what must we keep?'
Even after the privatisation of British Rail, British Coal and London buses,
the government would still own more than Pounds 100bn worth of tangible
assets, while local government owned a further Pounds 200bn.
'Improvement of the management of these assets depends upon breaking down
traditional barriers which have divided public-sector activity from the
private sector.'
