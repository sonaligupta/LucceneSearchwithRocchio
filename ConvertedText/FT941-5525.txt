FT  05 MAR 94 / Briefcase, Q&A: My landlord wants me out


I have a protected tenancy of a property which is my main residence. The
landlord is offering me a substantial sum of money to surrender the tenancy.
Would I be liable to income or capital gains tax?
The answer probably is no, but you have not given us much to go on. If you
are employing a solicitor in the negotiations for the surrender of your
tenancy, then he is best placed to advise you on the tax aspects.
