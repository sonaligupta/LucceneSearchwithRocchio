FT  15 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Stratagem to retain Firstpoint subsidiary


   By NIGEL CLARK


STRATAGEM GROUP, the investment holding company, has ended talks on the
disposal of its Firstpoint computer maintenance company.
The group said that a number of companies had expressed interest in buying
Firstpoint, but in view of the improving results it was to be retained. Its
figures are now to be consolidated from March 1.
Stratagem reported the decision along with its figures for the six months to
February 28 when pre-tax profits were Pounds 272,000 (Pounds 221,000
losses).
Firstpoint, which was not consolidated because of the talks, showed profits
of Pounds 588,000 (Pounds 526,000) before tax and management charges, which
totalled Pounds 300,000 and were included in Stratagem's other income of
Pounds 621,000 (Pounds 594,000). Stratagem also had a surplus on disposal of
investments this time of Pounds 69,000.
Earnings per share were 2.2p (3p losses) and the company has begun paying
interim dividends with a payment of 1.5p.
Stratagem also said it was changing its brokers from Kleinwort Benson
Securities to Panmure Gordon. Mr Bernard Kerrison, chairman and chief
executive, said the move was intended to improve the marketability of the
shares as Panmure was geared more towards smaller companies.
