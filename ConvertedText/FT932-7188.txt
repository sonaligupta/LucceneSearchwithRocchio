FT  25 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Kingstream lapses bid for Plateau


Kingstream Resources, the small Australian exploration company, has lapsed
its hostile bid for Plateau Mining.
Kingstream said this was because Plateau shareholders had passed a
resolution approving the reversal into the UK company by Dixon Motor
Holdings, a motor dealership in the north of England. The ownership of such
a business was not compatible with the commercial objectives of Kingstream,
it said.
On May 20, Kingstream had received acceptances in re-spect of 9.55 per cent
of Plateau's share capital. No more acceptances had been received.
