nine months


   By Agencies


Net profit at Telefonica Internacional (Tisa), the overseas arm of
Telefonica de Espana, Spain's state-run telecommunications group, rose to
Pta15.51bn (Dollars 118.9m) in the first nine months, up 47 per cent
compared with the same period a year ago, agencies report.
Earnings benefited from a 73 per cent rise in revenue from investments, to
Pta28.59bn.
The company said its recently merged Peruvian units, CPT-Peru and
Entel-Peru, posted a 24 per cent rise in revenue from a year earlier, with
operating profit up 80 per cent, but did not provide details.
Telefonica also cited the sale of a 10 per cent stake in Telefonica Peru,
the group which controls a 35 per cent stake in the merged CPT-Peru and
Entel-Peru, to each of its Peruvian partners Banco Wiese and Grupo Grana y
Montero, for Dollars 200m.
It said revenue from its Venezuelan unit CANTV fell slightly.
Profits climbed 10.5 per cent to Dollars 193m at its Cia de Telefonos de
Chile unit, while its Telefonica de Argentina unit posted a 26 per cent
increase in profit to Dollars 392m.
The company also said that Telefonica Internacional had acquired a 20 per
cent stake in Telecommunicaciones y Sistemas SA of Argentina, which provides
communications services to large clients.
At the end of the third quarter the companies in which the international arm
has stakes managed more than 7m telephone lines, while their cellular
telephone operations had 271,536 clients and the cable activities 49,768.
Earlier this month Telefonica de Espana announced a 17 per cent rise in
consolidated net profit in the first nine months to Pta86.61bn from
Pta73.72bn.
Pre-tax profit climbed 11 per cent to Pta104.65bn from Pta94.68bn.
The growth in net profit was attributable to the declining corporate tax
burden, which is currently about 17 per cent of profit.
