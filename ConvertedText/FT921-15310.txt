FT  10 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Sears to sell stake in Seiyu
for Y6.5bn

SEARS, Roebuck, the large US retailer, has agreed to sell its 2 per cent
stake in Seiyu, the Japanese supermarket chain operator, writes Barbara Durr
in Chicago.
The sale, worth Y6.5bn (Dollars 52m), will raise some needed cash for the
struggling retailer.
The Chicago-based company has been trying to restructure its core retailing
operations for three years and is engaged in a cost-cutting effort.
This week, it announced it would eliminate some 7,000 jobs in a revamp of
its catalogue marketing service. The latest move was estimated to achieve
cost savings of about Dollars 50m this year.
Sears purchased the small stake in Seiyu in 1976 when the two companies
reached a mutual technology transfer agreement.
Sears suffered losses on its retailing operations during the third quarter
last year, and in the December holiday period it reported a 1.8 per cent
drop in its same store sales against those of 1990.
