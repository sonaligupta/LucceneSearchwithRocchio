FT  21 NOV 92 / UK Company News: A Fisher pays Pounds 0.85m to ex-chief


   By ANDREW BOLGER


ALBERT FISHER, the food processing and distribution group, has paid Pounds
852,000 in compensation to Mr Tony Millar, who stepped down in July as
executive chairman of the company he built into one of the stockmarket stars
of the 1980s, writes Andrew Bolger.
Mr Millar, who resigned following pressure from non-executive directors, was
on a four year contract and a salary of Pounds 252,000 in the year to August
31.
His departure came after a plunge in the share price and a profits warning,
as concern mounted about the acquisitive Mr Millar's ability to manage at a
time of faltering growth and a glut of fresh produce in Europe and North
America.
Last month the group reported a drop in annual pre-tax profits from Pounds
89m to Pounds 52.1m on flat sales of Pounds 1.18bn. The share price, which
fell from 82p in May to a low of 31p in August, yesterday rose 4p to 57p.
