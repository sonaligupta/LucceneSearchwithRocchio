FT  06 NOV 93 / BBC may extend satellite TV service


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


THE BBC is considering creating a range of international satellite
television channels, using its archives.
In the wake of a licence fee settlement linked to retail prices until the
end of 1996, the corporation is clearly being encouraged by the government
to maximise its earnings.
Mr Bob Phillis, BBC deputy director-general, said yesterday that the main
opportunities lay in creating thematic channels in areas such as
entertainment, education and factual programming.
Mr John Birt, director-general, warned that the BBC faced a future of flat
income with some rising costs. The corporation had to continue reducing
costs, seeking additional revenues from commercial activities and cutting
licence fee evasion.
The BBC confirmed that its target was to make further efficiency gains of 13
per cent over the next 13 years.
Producer Choice, the controversial move to an internal market for BBC
services, was working, the BBC said. But Mr Rodney Baker-Bates, finance
director, said the organisational change would be reviewed annually for the
next three or four years.
The BBC comments came after publication of the summary of a review of BBC
efficiency by consultants Touche Ross, which praised the way the BBC was
tackling change.
Without Producer Choice, Mr Baker-Bates said, 'the outcome of the Touche
Ross review would have been very different'. For the first time, the BBC
knew the true cost of all its programmes and facilities. For some people,
the finance director added, it had been an 'extremely enlightening and
sometimes startling process'.
As part of the internal review of all BBC resources, 1m sq ft of excess
accommodation had been identified and would be disposed of over the next
three or four years.
BBC borrowings, which are Pounds 142m, would be reduced to zero by the end
of 1996, apart from normal operating finance.
