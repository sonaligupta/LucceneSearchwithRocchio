FT  30 APR 94 / Ford cuts dealer margins on its executive range


   By JOHN GRIFFITHS


Ford's Granada and Scorpio executive models yesterday joined the list of
vehicles where manufacturers are slashing or eliminating dealer profit
margins in order to cut list prices - and the company car tax liability of
purchasers.
Ford would not disclose the sizes of the cuts in dealer margins but they
reduce the list price of the dearest model, the Scorpio 2.9 litre 24-valve
estate, to Pounds 26,545 - including value added tax - from Pounds 29,310.
The cheapest model, the Executive 2.0L, falls to Pounds 15,995 from Pounds
18,100. The cuts imply a reduction in margins to almost nothing for the
cheaper cars and to about 5 per cent on the more expensive models.
The Granada/Scorpio range has recently been sold on an official dealer
margin of 10 per cent. This followed a decision by Ford and other leading
carmakers last year to reduce the traditional margins of about 15 per cent.
Earlier this month Vauxhall launched its Omega model with a list price based
on a 5 per cent margin for dealers.
Ford has already gone a step further with its new Probe coupe. The cheapest
model costs Pounds 15,995 and dealers are simply being given a handling
charge of about Pounds 1,000 with no formal profit margin.
Rover is also understood to be launching two 'tax-beater' versions of its
Rover 800 executive cars, where dealers will receive only a Pounds 500
handling charge. Volvo and Renault have taken similar action.
The moves will save buyers substantial amounts on their company car tax
bills under the scheme based on list prices introduced earlier this month.
