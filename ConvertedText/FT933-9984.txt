FT  06 AUG 93 / Letter: Root problems and infighting facing IBM


   From Mr DUNCAN WHITE


Sir, Your reporting of July 28 and article of July 29 ('When surgery will
not prove the whole cure') fail to disclose the very real root problems
facing IBM. ln basically four different computer product lines  - mainframe,
personal computer, open system (Unix, RS6000) and mid-range (ASA400) -
almost no new 'mainframe' sites are being started because the new 'open
systems' offer four times the price performance. The AS400 seems to be at
the end of its product life cycle, with no certain upgradeable path. PCs
have no unique IBM ability as IBM did not design its own chip. The only
product with a future is the RS6000 series, but it is falling behind its
competitors which are introducing faster parallel processors.
Finally, all big decisions regarding R&D, marketing and strategy seem to be
made by the old time 'mainframers'. Can Mr Gerstner overcome the infighting
of these four groups?
