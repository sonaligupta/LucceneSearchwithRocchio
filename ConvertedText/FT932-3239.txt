FT  15 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Former SD-Scicon chief returns to computer
roots


   By ALAN CANE


MR PHILIP Swinstead, founder and chief executive of SD-Scicon, the systems
company, until its acquisition by EDS of the US two years ago, yesterday
signalled his return to the computer industry with the purchase of a
controlling interest in a small USM-quoted consultancy.
He has become the chief executive and largest shareholder in Comac, a
computer personnel company, through the purchase for Pounds 720,000 of a
19.4 per cent stake.
Samuel Montagu, SD-Scicon's adviser during the protracted takeover battle
with EDS, bought 10.52 per cent and a further 16.35 per cent was placed by
James Capel.
The shares were acquired from HIT Investments, a subsidiary of Hillsdown
Holdings, the foods group, which has been disposing of some of its
peripheral investments in recent months.
Comac made pre-tax profits last year of about Pounds 450,000 on turnover of
some Pounds 10m.
Mr Swinstead founded and guided Systems Designers to several years of
unbroken growth until disastrous fixed price contracts and a troublesome
merger with Scicon brought losses and the sale to EDS. He has been unable to
return to the business before now because of a non-compete clause in the EDS
deal.
He said yesterday that he was returning to his roots. Comac was in much the
same position as Systems Designers in the 1970s.
