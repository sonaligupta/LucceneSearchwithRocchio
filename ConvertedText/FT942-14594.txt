FT  20 APR 94 / France to increase defence spending


   By JOHN RIDDING

The French government and President Francois Mitterrand are today expected
to approve a framework defence programme, which calls for about FFr650bn
(Pounds 76bn) of expenditure between 1995 and 2000.
The spending plan, due to be presented to the National Assembly this month,
reflects the French government's commitment to maintaining a strong military
as well as a nuclear deterrent despite the ending of the cold war.
In contrast to reduced defence expenditure in much of Europe and the US, the
plan involves a real increase of 0.5 per cent each year during the six-year
period.
Despite the increased spending, the programme is expected to include delays
or cost-cutting measures for several important projects.
Programmes affected are expected to include a delay in the introduction of
the long-range M5 nuclear missile, which was due to enter into service in
2005, but which is likely to be pushed back until 2010.
The French government is also expected to seek a 20 per cent cut in the
costs of developing the NH-90 transport helicopter and a delay in the
delivery of Rafale fighter aircraft to the airforce.
The plan will include a commitment to maintaining France's land-based
nuclear deterrent and is expected to give approval for a viability study to
determine whether the submarine- based M4/M45 missile can be adapted for
terrestrial use.
The government's agreement to study the proposal represents a concession to
Mr Mitterrand, a strong supporter of a land-based deterrent, and is expected
to smooth approval of the defence package.
The defence programme is also expected to call for cuts in troop levels.
Ground forces are likely to be reduced by more than 10,000, from the current
level of 240,000, possibly involving the closure of one division.
Despite the reduction in certain programmes and in the level of manpower,
the expenditure plan reflects the thinking of a white paper on defence
policy published in February.
The white paper spelled out an ambitious defence policy into the next
century and dismissed the idea that France could reap a peace dividend
following the end of the cold war.
France's 1994 defence equipment budget, which has been set at FFr100.4bn
(Pounds 11.75bn), is already higher than that of its European allies.
The plan for the period 1995-2000, which will be re-examined in 1997,
implies that expenditure will amount to about 3 per cent of gross domestic
product, slightly less than the 3.4 per cent currently spent.
