FT  13 NOV 92 / Docklands move is abandoned


THE Department of the Environment yesterday said it had abandoned plans to
move 2,000 civil servants to London's Docklands.
Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, said he could not justify the move
in the light of falling rents in central London and the costs of the move at
a time of constraints on public spending.
