FT  12 MAR 94 / Savings bond attracts Pounds 480m


   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU


Sales of the most recent National Savings product - the guaranteed income
bond for pensioners - drew in Pounds 480m last month, accounting for the
bulk of National Savings' net contribution to government funding last month
of Pounds 775m.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, said he was pleased with the 'excellent'
result. 'I am delighted that so many pensioners have taken this opportunity
to protect the income from their savings.'
The bond, which pays an annual fixed rate of 7 per cent gross for five
years, went on sale on January 21 and has been bought by nearly 90,000
people aged at least 65.
Gross sales of National Savings products in February totalled Pounds 1.46bn.
Accrued interest was Pounds 158m and repayments amounted to Pounds 839m.
Premium Bonds, with sales of Pounds 201m, had their most successful month,
partly because those bought in February are eligible for the first Pounds 1m
prize draw in April. The total amount invested in National Savings at the
end of February was Pounds 47.7bn.
