FT  06 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Cost-saving idea for chancellor


   From S MCILROY


Sir, I would like to suggest a cost-reduction programme for the chancellor,
that would save (or release) considerable resources from current consumption
without removing the reasons for using those resources in the first place.
Abolish current road tax, transfer tax cost to fuel prices. Substitute the
old tax disc for an MOT disc, issued by garages, and display the MOT disc on
windscreens. This would save paper, police and magistrates' time, post
office counter staff time and much else. The government would not lose
revenue and millions of man hours could be reallocated to more important
tasks.
