FT  05 AUG 92 / France and Italy avert EC clash over power supplier

   BRUSSELS


STATE-OWNED electricity companies in France and Italy have decided to
compromise over the terms of a contract with a small Alpine producer rather
than confront the European Commission on the sensitive issue of mono-poly
rights in the electricity sector.
The Commission announced yesterday that it had dropped the threat of further
action against Electricite de France and Enel of Italy after they amended
the anti-competitive contract.
Sir Leon Brittan, the EC competition commissioner, welcomed the compromise
as 'a step towards the opening up of national energy markets', but EdF said
it was a specific case with few broad implications.
EdF is in the forefront of resistance to Commission plans to break open EC
energy markets, a top priority for Britain during its presidency of the
Community.
Societe Hydroelectrique de Grangevieille (SHG) - an independent French
electricity producer near the Italian border - complained to Brussels in
April last year that EdF was abusing its monopoly rights.
Sir Leon's spokesman yesterday described the original contract with SHG as a
'no-win situation' for the independent French producer. EdF was entitled to
buy all SHG's output at comparatively low French prices, and sell it on to
Enel. But SHG is cut off from the French market by a large mountain range
and is only able to supply electricity to Italy, where prices are much
higher.
The Commission argued that EdF's monopoly rights to buy French electricity
production did not apply in this case. The French group has now agreed that
SHG's electricity should be priced on the same basis as electricity which is
generated by independent Italian producers.
