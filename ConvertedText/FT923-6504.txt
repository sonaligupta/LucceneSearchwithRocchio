FT  24 AUG 92 / Observer: Wilhelm joins the ANC volk


Most white South Africans are deeply disillusioned with the African National
Congress these days. Hence it is rare to find a white man signing up as an
ANC member, and doubly so if his name is Verwoerd.
Dr Hendrik Verwoerd, the architect of apartheid, must be squirming in his
grave to learn that grandson Wilhelm, 30, has joined the ANC. Wilhelm, who
has a theology degree, had a political 'awakening' when attending Oxford as
a Rhodes scholar, according to his wife, Melanie, who is also an ANC member.
Within the Verwoerd family, his behaviour appears even more out of
character: his father, Professor Wilhelm Verwoerd, Hendrik Verwoerd's eldest
son, is a member of the ultra-right Conservative Party. His aunt and his
grandmother have moved to Orania, a whites-only village in the remote
northern Cape where blacks are excluded, even as labourers. It was
established by Verwoerd's son-in-law, Prof Carel Boshoff.
But the family is not just split between left and right: Hendrik Verwoerd,
Jr, another Verwoerd son, has set up a rival white homeland at Morgenzon in
the Transvaal. He and son-in-law Boshoff agree that they want to live
without blacks, but Verwoerd, Jr claims the entire industrial heartland of
South Africa as his territory, while Boshoff is content to live in dusty
isolation in the Cape.
