FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: A Pounds 50m magic wand from Ford - Plans
to revive the ailing Aston Martin Lagonda


   By KEVIN DONE


Ford, the US motor manufacturer, is planning to transform the fortunes of
Aston Martin Lagonda, the UK luxury sports car maker in which it acquired a
75 per cent stake in 1987.
Accounts filed at Companies House disclose for the first time the financial
scope of the project to develop a new range of Aston Martin sports cars, the
DB7, which are due to enter production next month.
Ford has injected Pounds 50m in new equity to fund the peak financing
requirements of the DB7 programme, in the process lifting its shareholding
to 99.5 per cent.
The DB7 programme has imposed a heavy burden on Aston Martin Lagonda's
finances.
The group's losses in the last two years - Pounds 18.9m in 1993 and Pounds
16m in 1992 - were incurred after charges to the profit and loss account for
the development of the DB7 totalling Pounds 13.7m in 1993 and Pounds 6.6m in
1992, including Pounds 2.1m for the original feasibility study.
The DB7 programme has led to a far-reaching reorganisation of the group.
The board now includes Mr Jackie Stewart, the former Formula 1 world
champion, Mr Nick Scheele, chairman and chief executive of Jaguar, and Mr
Tom Walkinshaw, whose TWR motor sports engineering group has played a
significant role in the DB7 project.
The Aston Martin Lagonda group accounts disclose that JaguarSport, a 50/50
Jaguar/TWR joint venture of which Mr Walkinshaw is a director, was paid
Pounds 10.1m in 1993 and Pounds 5.3m in 1992 for providing engineering
services for the development of the DB7.
Jaguar is 100 per cent owned by Ford.
The new Aston Martin sports car, expected to sell for below Pounds 80,000,
is heavily dependent on outside suppliers.
Body panels and welded bodies are to be supplied by Motor Panels, a
subsidiary of the Mayflower specialist automotive engineering and design
group.
The bodies will be painted by Rolls-Royce Motor Cars' plant at Crewe,
Cheshire, and the cars will be assembled at the plant in Bloxham,
Oxfordshire, which has previously built the Jaguar XJ220 super car.
The plant will be taken over this year by Aston Martin Lagonda. The DB7
engines will be assembled by TWR.
Last year Aston Martin produced only 144 cars at its Newport Pagnell plant
in its traditional Virage/Vantage range, which sell from Pounds 134,000 to
Pounds 178,000, but the group's output is now forecast to increase fivefold
with DB7 production set to total 600-700 a year.
Output of the DB7 starts next month with deliveries beginning in the UK in
the summer and in the US and Canada in the autumn of 1995. Output next year
is expected to total 625.
While the DB7 has been under development the existing Aston Martin business
based on the Virage/Vantage range has been under heavy pressure as a result
of recession in the US and UK.
Turnover fell from Pounds 27.3m in 1990 to Pounds 20.8m in 1991 and Pounds
12.4m in 1992, although sales began to recover to Pounds 15.9m last year
with a pick-up in both the UK and the US. The workforce has been drastically
reduced to an average 285 last year from 359 in 1992, 448 in 1991 and 522 in
1990.
