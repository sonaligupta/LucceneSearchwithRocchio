FT  24 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Chancellor stalls in the showroom


   By PETER NORMAN


MR NORMAN Lamont's appearance in Birmingham to launch the Conservatives'
campaign there confirmed him as one of nature's less lucky politicians.
He came to Birmingham to attack Labour's tax plans and publicise the goodies
for the car industry in his recent Budget. The start of his day was hardly
auspicious. Mr Lamont faced only a handful of journalists at Tory
headquarters in suburban Edgbaston.
The chancellor's later photo-opportunities were similarly low-key. 'Ask
about our redundancy protection schemes,' screamed a poster in a Rover
dealership where he had gone to present the keys of a new Rover 420GSA to
its owner. The purchaser failed to turn up. Instead Mr Kelvin Dignam, aged
65, was the surprise recipient of the chancellor's attentions when he
arrived to pick up his rather less glossy model.
'Here's the key. Open the box,' enthused Mr Lamont. 'Are you giving me this
car?' asked a surprised Mr Dignam, who had refused to say whether he would
vote Tory 'in the light of current events'.
Mr Lamont's day improved at lunchtime, where he met sympathetic businessmen.
But here too, his fortunes were mixed. Journalists pressed him to explain
whether the government really was breaking a 'golden rule' of fiscal probity
by borrowing to finance current expenditure.
'I have never accepted any golden rules about the PSBR,' Mr Lamont
complained. This was true. British fiscal policy has no such rule. But the
surrounding news sleuths were left wondering: 'Why not?'
