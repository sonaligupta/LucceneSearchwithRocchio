FT  27 JUN 92 / World Commodities Prices: Spices


Europe has been flooded with ginger from Nigeria, reports Man-producten, but
most parcels are of inferior quality. Cochin ginger prices are a little
firmer after a late moonsoon, which has also lifted the turmeric market.
Nutmegs are steady, with increasing demand for West Indian defectives. The
fall in the dollar has boosted dollar prices for cassia, and some countries
of origin believe the market has started to improve. Cloves are unchanged at
Dollars 650 a tonne - the lowest price for 25 years.
