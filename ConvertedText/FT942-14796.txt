FT  19 APR 94 / Directors' training priorities revealed


   By LISA WOOD


Equal opportunities, foreign languages and international competitiveness are
the three topics on which newly appointed senior managers and directors are
the least likely to receive training, says the Industrial Society, Lisa Wood
writes.
Business planning and people management are the two top training topics in
the society's latest training trends survey of 458 managers.
Some 44 per cent of senior managers, for example, said that management of
people was their current priority for the training of senior staff. By
comparison, international competitiveness came at the bottom of the list.
Board level directors expressed slightly more interest in international
competitiveness, although it still came at the bottom end of their list.
