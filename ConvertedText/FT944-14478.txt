FT  22 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow weighed down by weaker
dollar


   By FRANK MCGURTY


   NEW YORK


Wall Street
US stocks suffered more losses yesterday as investors trained a wary eye on
the bond and foreign exchange markets, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 19.85 lower at 3,891.30, while the
more broadly based Standard & Poor's 500 was down 1.96 at 464.89.
But the level of the declines obscured the breadth of the market's downturn.
On the NYSE, losers outpaced gainers by more than three to two. Volume was a
fairly heavy 310m shares.
In other leading markets, the Nasdaq composite was 2.86 weaker at 765.38,
while the American composite was off 1.41 at 456.35.
The Dow industrials opened sharply lower, following through on the previous
session's 25-point downturn. There was no fresh economic news released.
Early weakness in the dollar, which was hovering near its postwar lows
against the yen and D-mark during the morning, inspired a new round of
selling on the US Treasury market.
That pushed the yield on the benchmark 30-year government issue through 8.00
per cent, an important technical barrier, where it remained for most of the
morning. But near midday, bonds recovered a little and the dollar rallied.
The slight improvement enabled stocks to retrace some of their losses, but
the majority were mired in negative territory as a sour mood dominated.
The stream of third-quarter earnings news which had poured into Wall Street
earlier this week slowed yesterday. Positive surprises continued to
outnumber unpleasant ones, but the rewards were parsimonious
Mobil, the first big oil groups to release results, posted net income of
Dollars 1.29 a share, about 7 cents above the consensus forecast of
analysts, but the stock slipped Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 80 1/2 .
General Motors continued to suffer the consequences of a disappointing
third-quarter performance, revealed on Thursday. The car maker's shares fell
a further Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 41 1/4 after Salomon Brothers cut its
full-year earnings estimate on the company.
Kimberly-Clark dropped a further Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 51, bringing its
losses over two days to nearly 12 per cent. Yesterday Brown Brothers
Harriman downgraded the stock, citing because of disappointing European
earnings.
On the Nasdaq, Summit Technology was marked up Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 34
7/8 after a Food and Drug Administration advisory committee issued a
conditional recommendation for approval of the company's laser treatment for
short-sightedness.
Snapple Beverage surged Dollars 2 3/16 to Dollars 14 on speculation that
either Coca-Cola or PepsiCo would launch a takeover bid.
Canada
Toronto posted moderate losses in light trading following New York to lower
ground on weakness in bonds.
The TSE 300 composite index dropped 34.64 points, or 0.80 per cent, to
4,285.13, with losers over gainers 431 to 293. Volume of 40.62m shares with
a value of CDollars 497.9m were down from Thursday's 64.16m worth CDollars
742.6m. The TSE was down 47.29 points, or 1.09 per cent, on the week.
Overall, 13 of the 14 sub-indexes were down today, led by conglomerates,
consumer products, gold and paper stocks. Only pipelines gained ground.
Brazil
Sao Paulo was down in weak trading with investors concerned that recent
government measures to combat consumer spending and foreign investment show
a lack of direction behind Brazil's economic reform plan.
The Bovespa Index, fell 1,625 points, or 3.4 per cent, to 45,619 points. Rio
de Janeiro lost 480 points, or 2.7 per cent, to 17,006 points on the BVRJ
index.
