FT  01 NOV 93 / The Week Ahead


Results due
SEVERAL of the UK's largest retailers will be reporting interim results this
week.
The UK's two most profitable retailers, Marks and Spencer and J Sainsbury,
report on Wednesday, and both are expected to show a healthy increase in
pre-tax profits. M and S is forecast to lift pre-tax profits from Pounds
257.1m last year to between Pounds 285m and Pounds 295m. But its shares have
already risen substantially in expectation of good figures and analysts say
any hint of weakness, especially on the food side, could be seized on by the
City as an excuse to sell.
Sainsbury is expected to see interim pre-tax profits increase from Pounds
391.1m to Pounds 435m. But analysts are more interested in what the company
might say about the changing face of the UK food market in the midst of
rumours that Sainsbury is about to launch a price war, and after the
admission by Tesco in September that it was investing some gross margin in
lower prices.
On Thursday it is the turn of Boots, which is likely to report increased
interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 185m last time to about Pounds 210m this
time, after exceptional items relating to the sale of French subsidiary
Sephora and the withdrawal of the Manoplax heart drug by Boots
Pharmaceuticals.
Discussion is again expected to centre on the performance of the Do It All
DIY chain and the future of the pharmaceuticals division, but analysts are
not expecting any significant news.
BAT Industries, the tobacco and financial services group, is expected on
Wednesday to report an increase of about 25 per cent in pre-tax profits for
the first nine months of the year. Forecasts range from Pounds 1.31bn to
Pounds 1.38bn. Tobacco earnings will again feel the effects of the US
cigarette price war but the group should benefit from more favourable
exchange rates. Analysts expect further progress from Eagle Star, the
general insurance subsidiary, despite continuing losses on mortgage
insurance. Growth may be slower at Farmers Group, the US subsidiary.
British Petroleum, reporting third quarter results on Thursday, has enjoyed
a marked upgrading of its fortunes in recent weeks. Although oil prices have
fallen some Dollars 2 a barrel since the second quarter, UK petroleum
revenue tax has been cut to 50 per cent from 75 per cent and downstream
operations have turned in stronger performances. Profits of at least Pounds
175m (Pounds 117m) are expected net of stock gains of around Pounds 100m.
