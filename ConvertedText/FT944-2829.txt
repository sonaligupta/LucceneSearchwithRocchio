FT  15 DEC 94 / Education department told it can save Pounds 1.3m


   By SIMON LONDON, Property Correspondent


The Department for Education could save Pounds 1.3m a year by better
management of its office space, the National Audit Office said yesterday.
Almost all the savings could be achieved at the department's Sanctuary
Buildings headquarters in London.
Sanctuary Buildings is among the most expensive government buildings. The
department signed a long lease on the building in 1988, when central London
rents were close to their peak.
According to the NAO report, Sanctuary Buildings costs Pounds 594 per sq
metre or Pounds 11,346 per head a year, including rents, rates and service
charges. By using a revised office layout, Sanctuary Buildings could
accommodate another 110 workstations at an annual saving of Pounds 1.3m.
In contrast, the department's main building in Darlington costs only Pounds
87 per sq m or Pounds 1,375 per head per year. The NAO said that the
building could accommodate an additional 75 workstations, giving annual
savings of Pounds 88,000.
The department is unlikely to take all of the NAO recommendations on board.
It said that the increase in the number of staff contained in the
recommended office layouts for Sanctuary Buildings 'would not accord with
efficient and cost-effective working practice'.
