FT  06 AUG 93 / Gummer confirms guidance review


MR JOHN GUMMER, the environment secretary, has confirmed in a letter to Mr
Jack Straw, his Labour shadow, that the government is re-examining its
guidance to the Local Government Commission.
Mr Gummer's plans to put the review on a voluntary basis by requiring
councils to opt in were vetoed last week by Mr John Major, the prime
minister.
Mr Gummer's letter, however, makes clear that changing the criteria for
reviewing the counties remains a serious option. He said: 'We are
re-examining our guidance to the Local Government Commission. I can assure
you now that there is no question of abandoning the review.'
A decision is not expected until September.
