VENEZUELA plans to stretch the maturities on a portion of non-restructured
external debt from two to four years by issuing new bonds.
It is to restructure up to Dollars 1.5bn of obligations maturing in 1992-93,
out of a total of Dollars 5bn in non-restructured public sector external
debt.
This includes commercial paper issued to cover Venezuelan military purchases
and non-guaranteed credits on exports to Venezuela.
Mr Pedro Rosas, finance minister, said the government planned to issue
Republic of Venezuela bonds with maturities of up to four years to cover the
refinancing. They may be in US dollars, other hard currencies or Venezuelan
bolivars.
