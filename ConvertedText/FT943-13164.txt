FT  21 JUL 94 / International Company News: Cummins ahead and forecasts
further growth


   By MARTIN DICKSON


Cummins Engine, the US diesel engine manufacturer, yesterday announced a 37
per cent increase in second-quarter net earnings. It was helped by strong
demand in the US and signs that other economies were recovering.
The group reported earnings of Dollars 66.2m, or Dollars 1.58 a share,
compared to Dollars 48.2m, or Dollars 1.32, in the same period of last year.
Sales rose 10 per cent to Dollars 1.2bn.
Sales to the heavy duty truck market totalled Dollars 354m, up from Dollars
336m a year ago. Sales in power generation were Dollars 268m, up from
Dollars 237m, which the company said reflected strong demand for industrial
generator sets.
Mr Jim Henderson, chief executive, said the company expected third-quarter
earnings would substantially exceed the same period of 1993.
For the six months, Cummins earned Dollars 120.8m, or Dollars 2.94 a share,
compared to Dollars 89.3m, or Dollars 2.44 a share in 1993.
