FT  22 OCT 92 / Machinery directive set to be dropped


   By ANDREW BAXTER


A CONTROVERSIAL EC proposal which the UK believes would probably kill trade
in used machinery looks likely to be quietly dropped after strong opposition
by a majority of EC countries.
The Directive on Used Machinery - now in its third draft - is intended to
apply much the same safety requirements to second-hand machinery as new
equipment will face under the 1989 Machinery Directive.
At a meeting in Brussels in June, seven member states objected to the draft
in principle, and only Spain and Italy supported it.
Mr Edward Leigh, UK trade and technology minister, yesterday said 'the
latest indications are that it will be dropped altogether.' The European
Commission is expected to make an announcement soon.
