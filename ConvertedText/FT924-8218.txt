FT  12 NOV 92 / UK Company News: IFE offers cash alternative for TVS


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


TVS shareholders are to be given a full cash alternative under revised terms
of the recommended offer by International Family Entertainment of the US.
The initial offer for TVS, the south of England ITV company that lost its
franchise, was a mixture of paper and cash valued at Pounds 38.2m. The new
full cash alternative - 23p a share for ordinary shareholders and 43p for
preference shareholders - is worth about Pounds 36m.
The value of the share offer has been increasing because of the sinking
pound and performance of IFE shares in New York.
The sterling value of a new IFE share for the offer document due out on
Friday has been taken to be 759p. This is based on the Dollars 11.5 (Pounds
7.60) price of an IFE share and an exchange rate of Dollars 1.516 to the
pound on November 10. This, the company says, values TVS at approximately
Pounds 47.8m.
It is not clear how many small TVS shareholders will be interested in
holding American stock. Under revised terms a free dealing offer for IFE
stock has been withdrawn.
IFE is the company behind The Family Channel, a successful cable television
channel in the US, controlled by Mr Pat Robertson, the television evangelist
and his son Timothy.
Meanwhile, a second US television production company has expressed an
interest in TVS, which owns the MTM production company in the US.
A number of preference shareholders have expressed opposition to the IFE
deal on the grounds that it undervalues TVS.
