FT  05 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Turnround to Pounds 15.8m at Hambro
Countrywide


   By SIMON DAVIES


Hambro Countrywide, the estate agent and financial services chain, yesterday
announced its return to profitability in 1993, as a result of increased
house sales and profits from investment disposals.
Mr Harry Hill, joint managing director, was confident of strong sales growth
in 1994, and said the company was keen to acquire a sizeable estate agency
chain to add to its network of 446 offices.
The company reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 15.8m (Pounds 1.58m deficit)
last year, after five consecutive years of losses. Turnover rose from Pounds
90.8m to Pounds 96.9m.
The results were significantly lifted by the Pounds 12m profit from the sale
of investments in Hambro Legal Protection and Hambro Countrywide Security.
The estate agency division cut losses from Pounds 13.6m to Pounds 2m, and
has started to open new offices, reflecting renewed confidence after years
of retrenchment.
The company owns Hambro Guardian Assurance, which became a fully-fledged
life assurance company in October upon the expiry of a five-year link with
Guardian Royal Exchange on reassurance and policy administration.
Life assurance activity contributed a pre-tax profit of Pounds 10.7m (Pounds
10.8m), and Mr Hill expected the decoupling from GRE to boost profitability.
Hambro's strategy is to sell financial services, mortgages, and
property-related services through its estate agency network. The key to
rising profits is, therefore, rising house sales.
During 1993, Hambro sold 47,275 houses, a 21 per cent increase over 1992.
In the first two months of the current year, Hambro has achieved a 34 per
cent increase in the number of house sales in the hands of solicitors.
Hambro is cash neutral. Mr Hill said the company was keen to pick up 200 to
300 new offices from one of several unwilling owners of estate agency
chains.
A final dividend of 0.25p is proposed, making a total of 0.75p for the year.
Earnings per share amounted to 4.43p (0.67p losses).
