FT  19 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Whitbread


Whitbread's 24 per cent drop in profits may partly reflect the concentration
of its business in recession-bound south-east England. That does not
automatically mean, however, that it is particularly well positioned to take
advantage of recovery. With a beer market share of just over 13 per cent, it
is hardly a top league player: even the much-vaunted Boddington brand still
only accounts for about 10 per cent of its beer business. Moreover, the
government's insistence on a reduction in its pub estate has led it into
lease arrangements which seem bound to reduce the price it obtains for beer.
Granted, Whitbread is not the only brewer grappling with this problem, but,
even in a recovery, there is no guarantee that beer will generate the cash
needed to support the company's unwieldy collection of retail businesses.
The only real justification for Whitbread staying in hotels is that it would
currently be too expensive to exit. It may now be the largest off-licence
retailer in the UK, but this is a low-margin activity whose growth potential
must be in doubt.
It would help if Whitbread had more of an international dimension, but its
decision to abandon the European Pizza Hut franchise suggests it has turned
its back on this priority. Perhaps the strategic direction will be redefined
after Sir Michael Angus takes over as chairman this summer. In the meantime
there is little reason for the shares to outperform, although they are
underpinned by a gross yield of nearly 5 per cent.
