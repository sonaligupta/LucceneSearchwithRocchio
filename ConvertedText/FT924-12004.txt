FT  22 OCT 92 / Observer: Bouncing back


No one can accuse the the Natural Law party of shirking the big tasks. In
April's general election it signally failed to break the mould of British
politics, gaining not one seat. But it is fielding a candidate for the US
presidency, John Hagelin, who has a PhD in nuclear physics from Harvard.
Moreover it has passed the hurdles necessary to get federal funding. The US
Federal Election Commission voted unanimously on September 17 and again on
October 15 to award the party - which bases itself on the teachings of the
Maharishi Mahesh Yogi - 'national party committee status'.
The Natural Law party is on the ballot in 32 states and has at least 100
candidates running for federal and state office. But despite getting 235,000
signatures to get onto the ballot in California, the party submitted them
two weeks after the deadline; the one state it might have done well in will
now not have any candidates.
