FT  28 JAN 94 / Ford sets up factory for used-car venture


   By JOHN GRIFFITHS


Ford is setting up a 'used-car factory' to prepare and sell to its dealers
up to 85,000 nearly new vehicles a year.
The venture, called Ford Direct, is believed to be the first used-car
retailing scheme in which the manufacturer is taking direct responsibility
for preparing vehicles for sale and providing warranties for them.
It also represents a response to research carried out by Ford during the
past 18 months which, the company admits, shows motorists to be 'deeply
cynical' about the integrity of the motor trade - frequently with good
reason.
The high level of complaints from consumers about used cars has led the
Office of Fair Trading to start an investigation into the trade and its
dealers.
The Ford Direct venture, which starts next month and in which the company is
investing about Pounds 10m, initially is being confined to cars less than
one-year-old. All will be returned vehicles from short-term rental companies
which Ford has supplied, or from Ford's own company fleets.
This means initial maximum yearly sales through the scheme of about 45,000
vehicles. Yet if it is well received and proves commercially viable, it may
be widened to embrace other sources of similarly aged cars and total about
85,000 cars a year.
Even at the 45,000-a-year level, the scheme would account for about 10 per
cent of total annual sales of 'nearly new' cars under a year old.
Most of Ford's rivals run their own dealer-based 'manufacturer-approved'
used-car retailing schemes, such as Vauxhall's Network Q operation, and may
dismiss Ford's initiative as little different from their own schemes.
Yet Ford maintains that its scheme eliminates the three most serious sources
of concern aired by consumers about other operations: that dealer-based
'independent' pre-sale checks and tests are neither properly independent nor
rigorous; that warranties offered are not comprehensive enough; and that too
often dealers try not to honour them.
The fundamental difference, however, is the manner in which cars are to be
processed for sale.
In the opening weeks of the scheme Ford has contracted three independent
outlets to prepare the cars for inspection by its own personnel and RAC
inspectors.
Mr Ian McAllister, Ford of Britain chairman, said the company was
identifying a final site for the single 'used-car factory', which will
process cars on flow-line principles similar to a normal assembly line.
The final stage will remain an RAC inspection after which the car is
identified with what Ford insists is a non-forgeable Ford Direct hologram.
The cars' specifications will be entered on Ford's computer network as they
are being processed, and the company's 1,000 dealers will bid for them via
their Viewdata terminals.
Ford says that as part of the scheme, which includes the company's 12-month
warranty, buyers will be able to exchange any car with which they become
dissatisfied up to 30 days after purchase.
