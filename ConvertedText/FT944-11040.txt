FT  08 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Wellington Underwrite listing hitch


   By RALPH ATKINS, Insurance Correspondent


A delay by Lloyd's of London in approving fresh rules on corporate
investment in the insurance market has caused a last minute headache for a
new underwriting company planning a listing.
Wellington Underwriting, which intends to invest in seven Lloyd's syndicates
run by the Wellington managing agency, is due to complete arrangements this
week for placing 30m shares at 100p.
It faces a scramble to finalise the details after Lloyd's regulatory board
failed last Friday to approve proposals allowing existing corporate vehicles
to invest in others. The issue will be considered by Lloyd's council
tomorrow.
Mr Anthony Cooper, chief executive of the Wellington agency, said the amount
that would be affected by the proposed changes was 'not critical', but the
hitch has made the timetable for Wellington's placing tight. Commitment
letters are due to be returned to Greig Middleton, its broker, on the same
day as Lloyd's council meets.
Impact day is set for this Friday with dealings expected to start on
November 17.
