FT  03 AUG 92 / Letter (2): Team briefings, rarely informative and pandering
to autocratic style


   From Mr ANDREW DYKE


Sir, I was surprised to see Yvonne Bennion defending the Industrial
Society's outmoded team briefing drill. Team briefing has failed as a
management tool because it is a one-way channel of communication - top
downwards. It offers no facility whatever for ideas and information about
the performance of the business to flow from the workforce back up to senior
management.
The Industrial Society used - perhaps it still does - to promote team
briefing by saying it was a technique modelled on the way the Roman army
briefed troops before a battle. Doing business in Britain today may feel
like fighting in a battlefield, but all the evidence is that successful
companies are the ones tha harness the goodwill and enthusiasm of their
people to the future growth and vitality of their business. Management tools
that simply pander to the autocratic style of management that is all too
prevalent in British companies merely contribute to the continuing failure
of those companies to climb out of the recession and hide the ineptitude of
chief executive officers who, unfortunately, lack leadership skills required
of Roman generals.
