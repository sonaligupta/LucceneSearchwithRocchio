FT  05 JUN 92 / Emergency declared as floods hit Argentina


   By REUTER


   BUENOS AIRES


ARGENTINA declared three provinces in a state of emergency after the worst
floods in nearly a decade killed 28 people and forced over 220,000 from
their homes in northern Argentina, Paraguay and southern Brazil, Reuter
reports from Buenos Aires.
Mr Jose Luis Manzano, Interior Minister, said the Argentine government had
declared the northern provinces of Formosa, Chaco and Corrientes in a state
of emergency and was putting three other provinces, Santa Fe, Entre Rios and
Buenos Aires, on alert.
Heavy rains over the past two weeks caused the Paraguay, Parana and Iguazu
rivers to overflow, sweeping flood barriers away and inundating hundreds of
towns and villages on their banks.
Officials in Brazil said 26 people had died in the southern states of Santa
Catarina, Parana and Rio Grande do Sul where nearly 100,000 people had
abandoned their homes.
In northern Argentina, where two men were reported drowned, Manzano
estimated that over 80,000 people had been evacuated so far.
Paraguayan authorities stood by to evacuate the 40,000 inhabitants of the
town of Pilar, where the waters were threatening to break through flood
barriers. Around 65,000 Paraguayans from low-lying areas of the capital
Asuncion have been moved to emergency camps on higher ground.
