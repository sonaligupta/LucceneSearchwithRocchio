FT  12 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Euro MPs back CAP reform


   By ANDREW HILL


   STRASBOURG


MR RAY MacSharry, the European Community's agriculture commissioner, said
yesterday there was 'absolutely no reason' why EC agriculture ministers
should not agree on reform of the common agricultural policy in April. He
was speaking after Brussels' reform plans received the broad backing of Euro
MPs, in what he described as a 'very positive' result.
Of the 520 amendments tabled, Mr MacSharry was particularly worried about
proposed changes to the core cereals clauses of the reform package. But
amendments which would have watered down the planned price cuts for cereals
and milk were rejected and will have to be re-examined by the parliament's
agriculture committee.
The committee had suggested a more moderate cut in cereal prices than
Brussels and also wanted to maintain milk prices, whereas the commission
plans a gradual reduction. But MEPs voted against those proposals and new
amendments on cereals and milk will have to be tabled at the next full
session of Parliament in April.
Mr Reinhold Bocklet, the German Christian Democrat reporting for the
agriculture committee, said his colleagues were likely to settle for a 20-30
per cent price cut.
