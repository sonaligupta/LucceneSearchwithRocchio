FT  01 DEC 94 / International Company News: US machine-tool group acquires
Krupp Hoesch unit


   By ANDREW BAXTER


Cincinnati Milacron, the big US machine-tool and plastics machinery
manufacturer, has announced its biggest European acquisition with the DM150m
(Dollars 95m) purchase of Krupp Widia from Krupp Hoesch, the German steel
and engineering group.
The purchase, for DM113m cash and the assumption of DM37m of debt, marks
another expansion of Milacron's sales in industrial consumable products,
following its Dollars 80m purchase in 1992 of the US company Valenite.
Essen-based Krupp Widia is Europe's second-biggest producer - after Sandvik
of Sweden - of metal-cutting tooling, used mainly on machine tools. Its
range includes carbide inserts, insert holders, carbide dies and wear parts,
and magnets.
The deal comes two months after Sandvik withdrew from the proposed purchase
of most of Krupp Widia, after the German cartel office said the Swedish
group would gain too strong a position in certain product segments on the
German market.
Krupp Widia's sales this year are estimated at about Dollars 250m, with
about 15 per cent in India and most of the rest in Europe.
The deal will include Widia (India), in which Krupp Widia has a 51 per cent
stake.
Milacron said the deal should push its annual revenues to more than Dollars
1.5bn next year and add 'a solid profit contribution in 1996'. Its sales in
1993 were Dollars 1bn.
Mr Mike Claybaugh, Milacron's group vice-president for machine tools, said
the deal would lift sales of the industrial products business from about
one-third to more than 40 per cent of total sales.
This would further reduce the US company's exposure to the more cyclical
machine tools and plastics machinery markets.
