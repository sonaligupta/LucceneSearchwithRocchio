FT  21 DEC 92 / Construction Contracts: Improving Brighton's sewerage system


When you're lying on Brighton beach next summer put your ear to the shingle
and listen carefully: 30 metres below you sophisticated tunnelling equipment
and dozens of construction workers will be carving a cathedral-like cavern
out of the chalk.
When completed, you will be able to drive a double-decker bus through the
six metre diameter and five kilometre long tunnel, which will stretch from
one end of the beach to the other - from Brighton marina to Hove.
Technology similar to that used in the Channel Tunnel will be employed to
excavate the Pounds 30m tunnel, which is designed as an overflow for
Brighton's wastewater system, to be used in heavy storms.
Although the primarily Victorian sewerage system serving Brighton and Hove
is still in excellent condition, there is a risk of overflow into the sea
during particularly heavy rain.
The tunnel will eliminate this risk by collecting and storing the excess
wastewater, which after the storm will be pumped to the treatment works for
normal treatment.
The tunnel's storage capacity will be 123,000 cu metres or about 26m
gallons. The main entry point for tunnelling will be at Black Rock to the
east of Brighton and will be extended westward to Hove. Four dropshafts will
be constructed on the foreshore to interecept storm overflow discharges.
Contracts are expected to go out to tender this week and work is expected to
take three years to complete.
The tunnelling project is part of a programme which will see Southern Water
investing more than Pounds 3m each week for the next 10 years on a large
number of projects throughout its supply area.
