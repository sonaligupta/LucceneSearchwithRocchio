FT  12 MAR 94 / Councils lose challenge to reforms


   By JOHN MASON


A High Court judge yesterday rejected applications by three councils for a
judicial review of the Local Government Commission's proposals for council
reorganisation in north-east England.
Humberside and North Yorkshire county councils and Ryedale District Council
are all opposing the commission's recommendations for five unitary
authorities north of the Humber in place of the current two-tier system.
They had argued to the High Court that the commission had failed to consult
properly or to consider the possibility of maintaining the status quo.
Mr Justice Laws rejected their applications, ruling that the commission had
acted properly. He said the applications by the three authorities were an
attempt to raise a challenge on points of law about the commission's
recommendations when in fact their complaint was about the merits of its
recommendations.
'It is elementary that complaints of this kind are not generally the
business of the judicial review court,' he said.
It was more appropriate for representations to be made to Mr John Gummer,
the environment secretary, than to the courts, he suggested.
The judge's ruling does not clear the way for the government to reach an
immediate decision on the commission's recommendations. The authorities
intend to apply to the Court of Appeal for a hearing to mount another
challenge. No decision could be made until after any such hearing.
