FT  23 OCT 92 / Management: Going for the capitalist option: Perks / A look
at the growth of employee share ownership schemes


   By PHILIP COGGAN


Employee share ownership is like motherhood and apple pie; everyone seems to
be in favour of it. Those on the right believe that employees who are given
a stake in capitalism will be more productive and less inclined to
disruption. Those on the left argue that workers are entitled to share the
fruits of their company's success.
The popularity of such schemes is such that nearly 1.5m employees and
directors are estimated to have received shares or options worth more than
Pounds 3bn in the year to March 1991. According to a recent survey by the
Confederation of British Industry, 44 per cent of companies offer
share-ownership schemes to at least some of their employees.
During the early 1980s, however, it seemed that the benefits of share option
schemes were mainly confined to directors. There was an intellectual
rationale behind the trend. By creating a commonality of interest between
directors and their institutional shareholders, both could benefit. The 20th
century barriers between the owners and the managers of capital could be
partly broken down.
The problem was the 1980s bull market. Directors made small fortunes through
their options, regardless of individual or corporate performance.
Institutional shareholders started to impose limits and performance targets
to prevent excessive dilution of their shareholdings. In the late 1980s and
early 1990s, the problem has been turned around. Tumbling stock markets have
left many directors with options which are not profitable to exercise -
'underwater' in the jargon.
This is not to say that schemes have lost all popularity. 'Options are
recognised as a status symbol,' says Damien Carnell of New Bridge Street
Consultants. By the end of financial year 1990-91, some 4,721 companies had
executive-based schemes in place.
But governments have worked hard to encourage the adoption of all-employee
schemes by, for example, allowing directors to receive discounted options in
schemes which are open to all the workforce.
One all-employee plan achieving growing popularity is the save-as-you-earn
scheme. A total of 972 schemes had been approved by the end of 1990-91, with
more than 500,000 employees taking part.
Under such schemes, employees are given options to buy shares in five or
seven years' time - and the exercise price is normally set at a 20 per cent
discount at the time the options are granted.
In addition, employees are given 'interest' in the form of a bonus at the
end of the five or seven-year period. This bonus now represents the
equivalent of 12 monthly contributions after five years, and 25 monthly
contributions after seven years. That translates into compound annual
returns of 7.5 per cent and 7.38 per cent respectively.
This interest is tax-free, and so represents an attractive return even if
the options become worthless. If the employee does make a gain on the share
options, that is subject to capital gains, not income tax.
Since each individual is entitled to realise Pounds 5,800 of tax-free
capital gains (after allowance for the effects of inflation) in a financial
year, most people can avoid paying tax on their gains; simply by selling
their shares over several years or by placing Pounds 3,000 worth in a single
company Personal Equity Plan, on which no CGT is payable.
Up to Pounds 250 a month can be saved via this system and the gains can be
huge. In 1986, for example, Wellcome employees were given the right to buy
shares in five years' time for Pounds 1.29. Just after the end of the five
year period, those who had invested Pounds 50 a month (Pounds 3,000 in all)
would have been entitled to shares worth more than Pounds 24,000.
As word has spread among the workforce of the advantages of such schemes,
more and more employees have signed up. Some companies with substantial
workforces have encountered dilution constraints, where they want to issue
more shares than their institutional shareholders will allow.
One route round the dilution problem is the employee share ownership trust.
This is a body with certain tax advantages which is able to buy existing
shares in the market - thus avoiding the need to issue new shares.
Trusts have often been used as part of management buy-out plans to encourage
cross-company support for the deal. Usually, such schemes involve no
financial commitment on the part of the employee; instead the trust buys the
shares - using a loan guaranteed by the company - and then gives them to
workers. Provided the employee holds the shares for five years, the gift is
free from income tax. Although many employees have prospered through such
plans, whether any of these schemes actually represent an effective means of
widening share ownership is doubtful.
In many cases, directors and employees sell their shares as soon as the tax
rules allow. In effect, therefore, share schemes are often merely a complex
way of giving staff a delayed cash bonus.
Carnell says that companies are trying to find ways round this problem by
looking at alternative structures such as restricted share schemes - under
which executives are given free shares which cannot be sold for a set period
 -or equity partnership schemes - under which companies give matching free
shares to executives who are prepared to commit their own funds to
purchases.
It has yet to be proved conclusively that either director, or
employee-based, share schemes benefit companies in the long run in terms of
improved profitability. And companies where employees have a significant
stake in the equity are still a rarity.
But as long as schemes continue to receive the support of the politicians
and tax authorities, it is hard to see them going out of fashion.
