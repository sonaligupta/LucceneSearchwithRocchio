FT  01 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Medeva seeks redundancies at generic drugs
offshoot


   By PAUL ABRAHAMS


MEDEVA, the fast-growing UK pharmaceuticals group, is in negotiations with
unions to make up to 220 of the 430 staff at Evans-Kerfoot, its generic
drugs subsidiary, redundant.
The company plans to scale back production of generic pharmaceuticals at its
Ashton plant, concentrating on niche medicines as well as supplying capsules
and tablets for Medeva's patented products, according to Mr David Lees,
finance director.
Evans-Kerfoot would incur a loss of between Pounds 1m and Pounds 2m in 1992,
he said.
Last March, Mr Bernard Taylor, executive chairman, said that its unbranded
generic businesses were for sale.
Since the beginning of the year, the subsidiary has lost its managing
director, finance director, production director and personnel director.
Mr Lees said the losses were not large in proportion to the rest of the
group, and the company was still on target to meet analyst's expectations of
about Pounds 35m profits this year.
It made Pounds 16.7m before tax last year.
