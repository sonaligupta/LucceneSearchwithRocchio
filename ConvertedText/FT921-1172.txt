FT  25 MAR 92 / FT Conference: Packager seeks EC harmonisation


   By JOHN THORNHILL


A HEATED discussion about the packaging industry's response to environmental
pressures took place at the Financial Times conference yesterday, with
several industry representatives claiming consumers misunderstand packaging.
Mr Gerard Pre, packaging development co-ordinator at Nestec, part of the
Swiss Nestle food group, said the industry could not ignore consumer
pressures, however ill informed. 'We have to deal with perceptions and
perceptions become reality,' he said. Mr Pre pleaded for a harmonisation of
environmental initiatives across Europe and said environmental solutions
adopted in one country were often rejected by others.
Mr Michael Samuel, environmental affairs manager at J. Sainsbury, the UK
grocery chain, argued that the proposed European Commission legislation on
packaging waste was 'largely illogical' because it sought to treat packaging
in isolation from the general issue of waste.
He also fiercely criticised the German industry's solution for recovering
and recycling packaging waste.
