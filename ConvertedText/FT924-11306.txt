FT  27 OCT 92 / Transport barriers in EC prove hard to lift


   By DAVID GARDNER

EC TRANSPORT ministers yesterday made new but inconclusive efforts to agree
two critical measures designed to make next year's barrier-free single
market work: freer access to Europe's congested airports, and freedom for
road hauliers to operate inside other member states.
They rejected Commission plans to 'confiscate' under-used landing and
take-off slots at airports for redistribution to new entrants to the air
transport industry. Nor could they agree what constitutes a 'new entrant,'
the dying breed of low-cost independent carriers that Brussels had hoped
would invigorate the 'open skies' policy agreed by ministers in June.
Ministers made moreprogress on agreeing a compatible EC system of tolls and
road-user charges for lorries over 12 tonnes. Germany has made a common
system the precondition for allowing 'cabotage,' the right of foreign
lorries to ply their trade inside Germany.
However, there remains concern that the Commission's plan to place no limit
on charges would result, not in a common policy, but fragmentation of the
single market. Also, some of the poorer and geographically peripheral member
states made clear yesterday that they would not go along with the bigger,
more cental states imposing high charges in a loose policy which might allow
discrimination.
