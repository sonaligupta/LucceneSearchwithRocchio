FT  19 APR 94 / International Company News: Whirlpool ahead 16% in first
quarter


   By MARTIN DICKSON


Whirlpool, the US manufacturer of domestic appliances, yesterday reported a
16 per cent increase in comparable first-quarter net earnings, helped by
strong sales growth in the US, Latin America and Asia and cost-cutting in
Europe.
Whirlpool reported net earnings of Dollars 67m, or 90 cents a share,
compared with a net loss of Dollars 162m, or Dollars 2.27 a share, in the
first quarter of 1993, when it took after-tax charges for a new accounting
standard and for financial services subsidiary accounts.
Without the charges, 1993 earnings were Dollars 58m, or 81 cents a share.
Revenues for the latest quarter totalled Dollars 1.87bn, up from Dollars
1.81bn.
The group's home appliance operations reported earnings of Dollars 64m on
revenues of Dollars 1.83bn, compared with earnings of Dollars 51m on
revenues of Dollars 1.76bn.
Mr David Whitwam, chairman, said that 'in terms of operating earnings, we
are well on our way to what we expect will be another excellent year for
Whirlpool'.
In North America, shipments reached record first-quarter levels and ran
ahead of the industry, which grew about 8 per cent.
Whirlpool said that expectations for full-year 1994 industry shipments in
North America had risen to 6-7 per cent better than last year, due mainly to
stronger volumes of air conditioners and microwave ovens.
In Europe, Whirlpool had a slight gain in shipments but turned in its best
first-quarter operating results by continuing to make significant cost
reductions.
The company said central Europe, including new sales organisations in the
Slovak and Czech republics, had contributed nicely to first-quarter volumes.
Whirlpool's sale of its European compressor business to Embraco of Brazil
was expected to be completed in the second quarter.
