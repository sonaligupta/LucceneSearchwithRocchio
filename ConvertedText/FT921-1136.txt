FT  25 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: P & O


Relief that there was no property black hole, combined with a smaller than
expected drop in profits, contributed to an 8 per cent jump yesterday in P &
O shares. That said, investors are entitled to feel a mite puzzled that
revaluations of the newly divided Pall Mall empire and other group real
est-ate produced so little bad news. P & O has little exposure on the
development side, to be sure, but the negligible writedown of the Bovis land
bank and mere 4 per cent balance sheet hit for investment properties
certainly contrasts with experience elsewhere.
This would matter more if gearing, which, thanks to the Chelsfield deal is
back at 70 per cent, was steaming ahead like it was before the rights issue
last summer. Falling capital expenditure and sizeable property sales over
the next two to three years, though, promise to relieve this pressure in the
medium term. In retrospect the timing of Lord Sterling's huge investment
programme might have been a lot better, but even at last night's 416p close
the shares are an attractive recovery play. Not many companies with
cyclically depressed profits stand on a lower than market average multiple;
a 10 per cent yield implies caution on the dividend front which does not now
appear justified. Real glimmers of economic recovery, however, will have to
appear before the market is convinced.
