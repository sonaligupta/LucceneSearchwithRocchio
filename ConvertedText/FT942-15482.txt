FT  15 APR 94 / Economic Watch: Spanish inflation disappoints


The expected fall in Spanish inflation has so far failed to materialise as
March consumer price data showed a 5 per cent rise from the previous year.
The monthly increase of 0.3 per cent brought accumulated inflation this year
to 1.4 per cent, slightly higher than in the same period last year. The
government target for the year is to bring the rate down to 3.5 per cent.
The underlying inflation rate, excluding volatile fresh food and energy
prices, rose 0.5 points from February, leaving the increase compared with a
year earlier at an unchanged 4.9 per cent. Bank of Spain figures meanwhile
showed a 2.2 per cent monthly increase in broad M4 money supply, with an 8.7
per cent increase in lending to the private sector. David White, Madrid.
Norway's trade surplus fell to NKr1.67bn (Pounds 146m) in March from
NKr3.6bn in February and NKr4.5bn in March 1993. The cumulative
January-March figure fell to NKr9.90bn from NKr14.42bn in the same period
last year.
Italy's machine tool orders rose 30.7 per cent year-on-year in the first
quarter of 1994, the first rise for three years, the industry association
Ucimu reported. Domestic demand rose 17.4 per cent, while foreign orders
were up 44.9 per cent compared with the same period last year. Ucimu said
this was a sign of rising industrial confidence.
The number of registered unemployed in Poland dropped by about 19,000 in
March, a jobless rate of 16 per cent.
