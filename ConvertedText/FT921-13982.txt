FT  18 JAN 92 / Apex survival is 'unlikely'


APEX Trust, the organisation that provides training for young offenders, has
accepted that it is unlikely to find the Pounds 350,000 it needs to survive.
Apex says it needs Pounds 100,000 each from the Home Office and the
Department of Employment and could then raise another Pounds 150,000 from
private sources.
