FT  12 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Forward Technology lower at Pounds 89,000


Restructuring costs of Pounds 696,000 left Forward Technology Industries
with pre-tax profits for 1993 lower at Pounds 89,000, against Pounds
186,000.
Operating profit was 73 per cent ahead at Pounds 1.34m (Pounds 772,000). The
Sound & Vision audio cassette and CD activity was 26 per cent up while the
electronics side rose 80 per cent.
Mr Brian Chilver, chairman, said that the result was encouraging despite the
recession in Germany and France which had less effect than had been
expected. He added that the restructuring costs were below the Pounds
800,000 anticipated.
The outcome was achieved on turnover 9 per cent higher at Pounds 43.8m
(Pounds 40.2m). After a tax credit of Pounds 93,000 (Pounds 184,000 charge)
earnings per share were 0.5p, against breakeven. The company has decided to
pay a nominal single final dividend of 0.25p.
