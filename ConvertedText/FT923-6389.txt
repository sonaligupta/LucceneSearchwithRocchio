FT  25 AUG 92 / Electricity workers accept 'inferior' pay deal


   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff


EMPLOYEES at the merged retail arms of Eastern Electricity and Southern
Electric, the two largest privatised electricity companies, have accepted
new terms and conditions that union leaders admit are not as good as
national ones.
The deal is among the first local packages to be concluded among the 19 main
employers in the privatised industry. The first was at PowerGen, the
generator, where 6,500 employees agreed to harmonised terms and conditions,
single-table bargaining and increasingly flexible working.
The last national pay settlement in the electricity supply industry was
negotiated this year, with a 5.5 per cent settlement for 1992-93. Employers
then gave 12 months' notice of their intention to negotiate locally next
year.
The retail business, E&S Retail, was created earlier this year with the
merger of the retail and appliance servicing businesses of Southern Electric
and Eastern Electricity.
The new company, which began trading in April, has about 230 retail outlets
across the south and east of England.
Mr Paul O'Shea, southern district officer for Nalgo, the public services
union, said acceptance of the package was a recognition of the bad trading
conditions into which the recession had forced the sector.
Of the 1,391 Nalgo members balloted, 78 per cent accepted the agreement,
which took nearly a year to negotiate. Its terms include a freeze on staff
pay, a reduction in holiday entitlement and a more flexible working week.
Mr Derrick Burch, chairman of Nalgo's southern district electricity
committee, said staff had been told that, in order to survive, the new
company needed to restructure itself and its salaries in line with the
competition. He added that other companies were closing retail outlets and
servicing businesses.
