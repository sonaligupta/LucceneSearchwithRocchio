FT  27 JUN 92 / Gummer accuses French crews


   By BETHAN HUTTON


MR JOHN GUMMER, the agriculture minister, accused French trawlermen of
stirring up '1,000 years of rivalry and hatred' in the row over fishing
rights around the Scilly Isles.
He presented Mr Louis Mermaz, the French agriculture minister, with a
preliminary report on the incident on Thursday in which French trawler crews
allegedly cut the nets of British boats. The report will be passed to Mr
Charles Josselin, the French fisheries minister.
Mr Gummer said he expected 'immediate and very tough action', but both sides
emphasised that the incident would not be allowed to affect friendly
relations between the two countries.
French fishermen are alleged to have threatened the crews of three British
fishing boats and to have damaged their nets in a dispute over fishing
rights.
Two French trawlers involved were on their way back to their home port of
Concarneau yesterday. Two of the British boats returned to the disputed
waters, 16 miles north of the Scilly Isles, to check the damage to their
nets and recover what was left.
The minesweeper HMS Brecon, whose crew boarded one of the French trawlers,
was heading back to Plymouth. A Royal Navy patrol vessel, HMS Alderney,
plans to remain in the area as long as the fishermen are there.
