FT  27 MAY 93 / International Company News: Canadian pulp deal for Finns


   By BERNARD SIMON


ENSO-GUTZEIT, of Finland, is to become a minority shareholder in West Fraser
Timber, a mid-sized Canadian forestry company, as part of a deal in which
West Fraser is to acquire Enso's interest in a pulp and paper joint venture
in British Columbia.
West Fraser will pay CDollars 95m (USDollars 74.8m) and issue 2m common
shares in return for Enso's 50 per cent stake in the Eurocan venture, giving
Enso a 9.6 per cent stake in West Fraser. West Fraser will also pre-pay
about CDollars 43m owing on a note issued to Enso.
West Fraser owns the other 50 per cent of Eurocan, which has interests in
four sawmills and a pulp and paper mill.
