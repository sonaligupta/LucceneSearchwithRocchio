FT  22 OCT 92 / Observer: Tip off


What about the waiters? A form of exploitation of workers by management
probably unsuspected by the average restaurant-user has just come to light
in the Cayman Islands.
A court there has fined one of the leading hotels Dollars 375 for using tips
left for waiters to help in paying managers' salaries. The case was the
first brought under a 1989 law to stop hotel bosses from creaming off a
percentage of gratuities meant for underlings serving the public, including
bartenders and maids.
Whether they'll now have their wages cut by a compensating amount can only
remain to be seen. Meanwhile, in countries without such a law, anyone
wishing to be sure tips go to their intended recipient should perhaps hand
the waiter a cheque crossed 'a/c payee only'.
