FT  28 MAR 92 / Finance & The Family: Easier transfers


   By DAVID BARCHARD


CO-OPERATIVE banks across Europe and Canada have come up with a new and
cheaper way to transfer money from one country to another.
Tipa - Transferts Interbancaires de Paiements Automatises - will allow
consumers and small businesses to transfer one-off payments, pensions,
salaries, trade payments, insurance premiums and subscriptions. It is made
possible by the close links between co-operative banks in different
countries, which give them an edge over rivals in establishing a cheap and
reliable system of cross-border payments.
Payment instructions are made directly into the clearing mechanism of the
bank in the recipient's country. The exact amount the recipient will get is
stated in advance, in the currency in which it will be paid, and charges are
paid only at the time of the order.
Terry Thomas, general manager of the Co-op Bank, says payment can be
collected within four days. A more expensive, same-day payment service -
operated through Swift, the international bank electronic payment system -
will be available for emergencies. However, you will not be able to send
from the UK via Tipa until mid-May, although payments from France to
accounts in the UK start next week. Payments between Belgium and France are
already up and running.
One snag is that payment must be made in advance through a co-operative
bank, although it is not necessary to be a regular customer of one. In most
continental countries, co-operative banks have large networks with thousands
of branches, but the UK Co-op bank has only 207.
