FT  20 APR 91 / Commander says UN border team will take weeks to arrive

THE FIRST of 300 UN military observers will be in place on the Iraq-Kuwait
border by the middle of next week, Major General Gunther Greindl, who heads
the mission, said yesterday. However, it would be several weeks before the
whole 1,440-strong United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observer Mission (Unikom) was
in a position to take full control of the border zone - the precondition for
a complete US military withdrawal from the area.
Gen Greindl added that his force would not assume responsibility for the
15,000 Iraqi refugees at present housed in two camps inside the eventual
demilitarised zone, which will extend 10km into Iraq and 5km into Kuwait.
Their fate was being discussed by other UN branches - although he was unable
to give any details as to which, or what arrangements were being considered.
Workers from the Kuwaiti Red Crescent and the US civil affairs unit running
the two refugee camps say they have been given no indication who will take
over the camps after the US withdrawal.
Gen Greindl also made clear that the UN force had no authority to defend the
refugees from Iraqi retribution, which many fear will follow the departure
of US troops. 'The Security Council has given no mandate that the Unikom
observers - who are unarmed - or the infantry coming with them, can take any
physical action,' he said.
The 500 infantrymen who will form part of Unikom will be solely responsible
for defending the military observers, he said.
Iraq and Kuwait will be entitled to police their territory within the
demilitarised zone, but Gen Greindl said he had still to discuss details
with both sides. 'The guiding principle has to be that they can only
establish a presence which is essential to restore law and order,' he said.,
He said he had not yet discussed questions such as whether Iraqi police
would be permitted to carry weapons, but that his decision would be final.
