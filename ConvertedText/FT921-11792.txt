FT  30 JAN 92 / Letter: Consumer pays pollution tax


   From Mr BRYAN CASSIDY MEP


Sir, David Lascelles omitted one significant point from his excellent
analysis of European Community ideas for a carbon (or pollution) tax ('A
mission to make the polluters pay', January 28).
The 'polluter pays' principle is the same as the 'consumer pays'. The
environmental lobby seems to be unaware of this simple equation. Is it not
better to offer industry tax incentives rather than punish its customers by
increasing a tax burden which would be passed on in higher prices?
And what about the Japanese and the Americans? There is little evidence from
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and elsewhere to suggest that a
good environmental example from Europe would be followed by our competitors,
especially at a time of world recession.
