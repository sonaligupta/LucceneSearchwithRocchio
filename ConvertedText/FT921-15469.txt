FT  10 JAN 92 / Greenpeace condem US science body over Ross Ice Shelf crater


Sabine Schmidt, a Greenpeace scientist, descends into a dirty hole in the
Antarctic ice sheet. The environmental group yesterday condemned the US
National Science Foundation for causing a crater more than 10 metres deep in
the Ross Ice Shelf by blowing up toxic waste from an old research station on
December 30 instead of removing it from the region. Greenpeace is to analyse
contaminated ash and snow samples from the explosion.
