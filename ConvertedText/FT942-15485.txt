FT  15 APR 94 / Mandatory energy saving urged


   By DAVID GARDNER


   BRUSSELS


Mandatory targets on energy-saving should be introduced if voluntary
agreements prove insufficient to cut energy use and carbon dioxide
emissions, according to a working party of the Brussels-based Centre for
European Policy Studies. Over-concentration on the stalled EU carbon tax has
deflected attention from energy conservation, both as a means to sharpen
competitiveness and to meet EU commitments to stabilise carbon dioxide
emissions, the working party said.
The working party, comprising representatives of 10 oil companies and
utilities as well as manufacturing companies, prefers the voluntary approach
that industry has so far emphasised in opposition to energy taxes or
regulation. But it wants national targets for energy efficiency and a new
title in the Maastricht treaty committed to it. If the voluntary approach
falters, it calls for obligatory energy management in industry, regulations
to stop utilities promoting increased consumption, mandatory standards of
energy efficiency for appliances, and requirements for companies to report
on energy performance.
