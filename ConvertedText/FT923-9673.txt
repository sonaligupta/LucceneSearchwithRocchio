FT  04 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Novalal loss up and accounts qualified


Novalal, the USM-quoted plant propagation and biotechnology company,
incurred a loss of Pounds 3.49m for the seventeen months ended December 31
and had its accounts qualified. The company's year-end has been changed. For
the eight months to July 31 1990 the loss was Pounds 1.35m.
The auditors, Ernst and Young, said the accounts for the 17 months had been
prepared on a going concern basis which depended on the successful outcome
of actions being taken to secure the viability of the group.
These included continuing cost reduction, successful completion of trial
projects, establishing a business in Greece and raising mortgage finance.
The loss for the 17 months was struck after taking account of exceptional
provisons of Pounds 1.1m (0.2m). Losses per share emerged at 14.8p (6.8p).
