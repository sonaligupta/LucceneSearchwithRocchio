FT  06 AUG 93 / International Company News: Rustenburg earnings fall to
R281m

RUSTENBURG Platinum, the world's largest producer, suffered a 30 per cent
fall in earnings to R281m (Dollars 78m) from R402m in the year to June and
cut its dividend by 28 per cent to 165 cents a share from 230 cents.
The decline followed a poor first half and a substantial improvement in
second-half earnings, which rose by 55.6 per cent to R171.3m from R110.1m in
the first half.
The improvement was the result of an average 20 per cent increase in the
volume of sales of the main platinum group metals - platinum, palladium and
rhodium - and nickel.
Although US prices were mixed - palladium up by 23.1 per cent and rhodium
down by 42.6 per cent - the net effect was to increase sales for the second
half by 10 per cent to R1.55bn, against R1.41bn, giving total sales for the
year of R2.97bn, against R2.91bn.
Earnings fell 30 per cent for the year primarily because of the sharp falls
in the rhodium and nickel prices, with the result that revenues were broadly
unchanged despite increases in volumes.
The rhodium price averaged Dollars 1,807 an oz, compared to Dollars 2,683 in
1992, while the nickel price fell to Dollars 2.84 a lb from Dollars 3.46 in
1992.
Unit production costs rose by only 5.8 per cent, well below inflation.
Of the other two platinum producers in the Johannesburg Consolidated
Investment group, Lebowa Platinum improved substantially to record a R0.5m
loss, compared with a R9.4m loss in the first half.
Potgietersrust Platinum, the developing mine, should achieve its production
target of 200,000 tonnes a month within the next two months. The final
capital cost of the mine will be R385m, against initial estimates of R555m.
