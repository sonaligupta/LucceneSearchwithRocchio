FT  22 OCT 92 / Barclays to talk on staff loan cuts


   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff


BARCLAYS Bank is to talk to unions about cuts in cheap loans for staff.
The specialised staff loans are for cars, school fees and holiday and
retirement homes. The move is consistent with attempts by all the banks to
reduce costs in the recession.
Barclays Group Staff Union, which represents more than half the 77,000
staff, said the bank's agreement to talks at a regular meeting was
surprising. Barclays has always argued that the benefits are not negotiable.
The cuts, which will affect only new loan applications, took effect from the
beginning of this month.
BGSU said it had not been consulted on the cuts and warned the bank to
expect a 'fierce outcry'. The union said members were still smarting from a
pay award of a little more than 3 per cent on average and substantial job
losses.
Bifu, the banking union, which also represents Barclays staff, condemned the
cuts as 'petty and penny-pinching'. It said many staff thought the
announcement was a joke.
Barclays said the four loans had been replaced with two packages, similar to
those available to customers, but at a discount to staff. The bank said that
would offer staff greater flexibility and reduce the costly administrative
burden.
Barclays said it was happy to talk, but as the benefits were not
contractual, they were not negotiable. Unions were free to make
representations on any subject, but management did not plan to change its
position.
