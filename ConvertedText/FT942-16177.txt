FT  12 APR 94 / Construction forecast best since 1989


   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent


The most optimistic forecast for construction output for five years was
published yesterday by the National Council of Building Material Producers.
It follows a string of industry and government statistics pointing to a
marked improvement in construction orders since last autumn, particularly
for housebuilding.
The council, which represents companies with a combined annual turnover of
more than Pounds 30bn, expects the value of UK construction output, measured
in constant 1990 prices, to rise by 2 per cent this year and by a further
2.5 per cent in 1995.
That is a great improvement on the council's previous forecast, published in
December, when it expected output to rise by 0.5 per cent this year and 2
per cent in 1995.
It expects output to rise by a further 2.5 per cent in 1996 as the recovery
in housebuilding spreads to other sectors of the industry. It says repair
and maintenance work will lead the way in the private sector.
Public-spending reductions previously announced by government will reduce
investment in infrastructure and public-sector housing. Total output in 1996
would be 6 per cent lower than at the peak in 1990, says the council.
There is concern that tax increases and government spending cuts may yet
slow the pace of recovery.
Mr Peter Roberts, chairman of the forecasting panel and a director of IMI
metals group, said: 'The impact that higher taxes will have on confidence
remains unclear and government must be ready to meet any substantial
hesitation in consumer expenditure growth with further reductions in
interest rates.'
The increased optimism was due to the recovery in housebuilding and a higher
than expected rise in private commercial construction orders for offices,
shops, leisure and sports facilities.
That was helped by an increase in demand for City of London office space
after last April's IRA bomb blast. Retail construction also increased in
spite of a decline in orders for out-of-town developments.
Commercial construction was expected to rise by 2 per cent this year, by 5
per cent in 1995 and by 7 per cent in 1996. The council had forecast a
further 5 per cent fall in commercial activity this year and only a 4 per
cent rise in 1995.
The forecast for starts made by builders on private-sector homes has been
increased from 150,000 to 160,000 this year and from 160,000 to 175,000 in
1995. Public-sector housing output, however, is expected to fall by 9 per
cent in 1995 and 1.5 per cent in 1996.
