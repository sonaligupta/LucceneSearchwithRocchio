FT  12 APR 94 / People: Barry moves up at Wellcome


UK pharmaceuticals company Wellcome is merging the management of its entire
research, development and medical (RD&M) operations into one unit under
David Barry.
He takes over from Trevor Jones, formerly head of RD&M outside the US.
Jones, 51, moves to Wellcome's corporate headquarters to work with chairman
John Robb on what the company calls 'strategic projects' from May 1.
Wellcome says the changes bring the company into line with the rest of the
industry where one head of R&D is the norm.
Barry, 50, most recently held the post of vice president of RD&M at
Wellcome's US operation Burroughs Wellcome. He has been a main board
director since 1989, having joined Burroughs Wellcome in 1977. Previously he
was a surgeon who worked for the US Food and Drug Administration.
