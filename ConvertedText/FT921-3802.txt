FT  12 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Hills keeps hoping for successful end to
Round


   By NANCY DUNNE


   WASHINGTON


MRS Carla Hills, the US trade representative, continues to hope for a
successful outcome to Gatt's Uruguay Round before June next year, so that
she will not have to ask Congress to renew her negotiating authority again.
Implicitly leaving the Gatt talks without a deadline, Mrs Hills told a House
of Representatives trade sub-committee yesterday that EC disarray on farm
trade reform continued to delay a final pact. By contrast, negotiations for
a North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) might be concluded this year,
even in spring.
If a Gatt agreement was not in place by June 1993, she would have to engage
in another debate with Congress over fast-track negotiating authority. The
last debate, which resulted in a two-year extension of the authority last
year, was a strenuous exercise that dominated her agenda for several months.
She had urged renewal of the authority on the grounds that the EC was at
last ready to reform its farm support, thus removing an obstacle to
agreement. But the EC was still not 'of one mind on its negotiating
position'. The US and EC had held 'some quiet meetings', she added.
