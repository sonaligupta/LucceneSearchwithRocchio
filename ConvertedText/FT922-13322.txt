FT  13 APR 92 / Mickey comes home to d'Isigny


   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER


   MARNE-LA-VALLEE


THE RAIN stayed away yesterday as Euro Disneyland, Europe's biggest leisure
park, opened for business amid a barrage of publicity, including a Dollars
10m television Europe-wide advertising campaign capped by a two-hour live
broadcast to 30 countries on Saturday night.
The trains which should have carried opening day guests stayed away too,
halted by striking railway employees who claim that the extension of the
suburban line to the park, 20 miles east of Paris, has created staffing and
security problems.
Also absent was a speech of welcome from France's socialist government. Mr
Michael Eisner, Disney's chairman, declared the park open, on a cool and
hazy day, from a platform halfway up Sleeping Beauty's castle, and is seen
(above) escorting a 8-year-old Gorka Gallier, first visitor to the park.
Despite the virulent opposition of some French intellectuals and the
apparent reticence of the government, Disney's executives were warm in their
appreciation of their host country's efforts.
Mr Roy Disney, founder Walt's nephew, described the park as an emotional
homecoming for the family. The Disneys, he said, were French until the
Norman invasion brought them to England. The family's name was once
d'Isigny, after the town of Isigny-sur-Mer in Normandy.
The company is hoping for 11m customers this year, but queues at the
entrance three hours after opening were no more than four or five deep.
As to the park itself, France's anxious intellectuals can probably relax.
The idea of Euro Disney as a threat to French civilisation seems a bit
overdone when confronted with the reality of a spin on a fairground
attraction called Dumbo the Flying Elephant.
