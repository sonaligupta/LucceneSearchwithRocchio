FT  16 NOV 93 / Shetland and Orkney schools top main exam league


   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent


SCHOOLS IN Shetland and Orkney continue to achieve the highest percentages
of top grades in the main examinations for 16-year-olds in Scottish schools,
official exam results published by the Scottish Office yesterday show.
The results, which cover the past three years, give detailed figures on the
results for all Scottish secondary schools. They cover 'standard grade'
examinations and 'highers', which are normally taken one year after standard
grade and are the main examination for university entrants. Shetland and
Orkney score well on the standard grade tables, although their results for
highers vary sharply from year to year because of the small numbers of
pupils involved.
The results tables include the performance of Scottish independent schools
in standard grade and highers, but does not take account of those doing the
equivalent GCSE or A-levels set by examination bodies in England.
The Scottish Education Department has published no conclusions drawn from
the tables on the performance of the schools, although Lord James
Douglas-Hamilton, the education minister, said the 1993 results showed 'a
reasonably encouraging trend'.
While Shetland and Orkney, as well as Western Isles and Borders region,
emerge well from the tables in terms of the percentage of pupils getting top
grades, Strathclyde and Lothian, the two largest regions in Scotland, come
at the bottom.
The statistics by region and island council areas give only a broad picture.
The detailed information from each school is a more useful guide to
performance.
The exam tables include statistics on the proportion of pupils staying to
secondary year five after taking standard grade in secondary year four.
These show that the staying-on rate across Scotland has risen from 54 per
cent in 1991 to 60 per cent in 1993.
The issuing of the results tables is controversial because the results can
easily give a misleading impression of schools' performance. For this reason
the results booklet is replete with warnings and qualifications.
The Scottish Education Department issued tables showing the percentage of
pupils in each area gaining five or more highers in bands A to C.
Shetland - which topped the regional tables for the percentage of pupils
gaining three or more standard grades at high grades - was bottom of this
league, Dumfries and Galloway topped this league with 8.5 per cent.
