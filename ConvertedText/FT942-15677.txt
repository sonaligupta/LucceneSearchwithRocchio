FT  14 APR 94 / Black cab revisited


The latest design for a London taxi hit the road yesterday (above). But its
design is far from futuristic - it is inspired by a 1930s taxi.
Asquith Motor Carriage Company, which makes the new taxi, aims to combine
1930s style with 1990s comfort in the cab. The new taxi - which will cost
about Pounds 30,000 - boasts air suspension, power steering and a Ford
gear-box.
But perhaps most importantly for London's taxi drivers, the new Asquith can
still turn in a 25-foot circle. The new taxi, built in Essex, joins the two
other designs - the 1950s Austin FX4 and the Metrocab - on the streets of
London.
