FT  13 APR 94 / The Lex Column: UK television


The great television takeover frenzy pumped up the sector's shares like
balloons. Now the question is whether the surviving contractors will slowly
deflate or pop, given that the big bids are over. A 4 per cent fall in
Scottish Television's shares after yesterday's disappointing results
suggests the latter may happen. Ulster Television fell by a similar amount
in sympathy. Yet there were some particular factors at work at Scottish. The
company may have done well to retain its franchise with a cheekily low bid.
But the hidden costs of victory are emerging as its strong regional
commitment meant it spent Pounds 6m on Gaelic programmes.
Nevertheless, the other smaller television companies can hardly justify
their racy ratings solely on earnings prospects. Cable and satellite
operators will nibble away at advertising growth. Yet earnings are not the
only important variable. There may well be further consolidation among the
smaller contractors. Flextech's investment in HTV shows that television
assets are also highly prized by other media companies. The government's
review of the cross-media ownership rules may provoke a further wave of
speculative interest. That limits the downside risk to shares in
television's Celtic fringe.
