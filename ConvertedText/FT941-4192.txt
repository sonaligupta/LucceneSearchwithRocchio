FT  12 MAR 94 / Spanish inflation at 6-year low


   By TOM BURNS

Spain's underlying inflation, which excludes the more volatile price
movements of fresh foods and energy, fell by 0.2 per cent in February to
give a year-on year rise of 4.9 per cent, the lowest rate since April 1988.
Higher fresh food prices kept headline inflation unchanged to give a
year-on-year rate of 5 per cent. The underlying rate was helped by a fall
from 6.4 per cent to 5.9 per cent in the traditionally high-inflation
services component of the index. The extent of this fall indicated more
moderate unit labour costs as well as slack domestic demand. Analysts
believe inflation will fall rapidly in the coming months. Madrid securities
firm FG forecasts a headline annual rate of 4.3 per cent by June and 3.8 per
cent by the end of the year.
Germany's M3 money supply grew by a revised annual rate of 21.2 per cent in
January. The Bundesbank's target growth range for M3 in 1994 is 4-6 per
cent.
