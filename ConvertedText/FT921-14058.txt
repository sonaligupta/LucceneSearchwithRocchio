FT  17 JAN 92 / Output of cars falls by 4.5% to 1.24m


   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent


CAR production in the UK fell by 4.5 per cent last year from 1,295,610 to
1,236,922, according to figures from the Central Statistical Office and
Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. It was the second successive
annual decline.
Car output in December fell by 13.9 per cent, the fifth successive sharp
monthly fall.
In spite of the deep recession in the domestic market for new cars, output
was sustained earlier in the year by a big rise in production for export.
On a seasonally adjusted basis, car production in the six months to the end
of December was 13 per cent lower than in the previous 6 months and 16 per
cent lower than in the same six months a year ago.
Car output in December was 79,034 against 91,833 in the corresponding month
a year ago. UK car output reached a low point of 888,000 in 1982, but
recovered in the second half of the 1980s to peak at 1,299,082 in 1989.
Car production for export markets jumped last year by 49.2 per cent to
605,425, while output for the domestic market dropped by 29 per cent to
631,497. Production for export fell, however, in December, the third
successive monthly year-on-year fall.
Commercial vehicle output fell by 19.7 per cent last year from 270,346 to
217,107. Output has fallen by 33.5 per cent in two years from 326,590 in
1989.
The UK motor industry trade deficit fell to around Pounds 1.5bn last year
from Pounds 4.6bn in 1990 and a peak of Pounds 6.6bn in 1989, said the
society. The improvement has been brought about both by the recession, which
has sharply depressed imports of new cars and commercial vehicles, and by
strong performance in export markets.
