Western Germany's producer price index eased in June by 0.1 per cent from
May, but rose 0.4 per cent from June 1993, the federal statistics office
reported. Analysts had predicted a 0.2 per cent increase from May and 0.7
per cent from a year earlier. In May, producer prices rose 0.2 per cent from
April and were up 0.4 per cent from a year earlier. Western Germany's
seasonally adjusted and annualised inflation rate rose by 2.5 points both in
the second quarter and first half of this year, the Bundesbank said in its
July report. The data are based on cost of living indices, excluding the oil
tax rise at the beginning of the year. The bank said the 'moderate
development' of western German consumer prices in June was an extension of a
trend seen in recent months.
Italy's public sector deficit narrowed to a provisional L77,000bn (Pounds
32bn) in the first five months of this year from L88,665bn in the
corresponding period of 1993, the treasury announced yesterday. Tax revenue
amounted to L173,996bn in the period, public sector spending totalled
L210,447bn, while treasury operations resulted in a deficit of L36,451bn.
