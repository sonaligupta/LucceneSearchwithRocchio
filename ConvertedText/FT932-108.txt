FT  30 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Celsis valued at Pounds 60m as placing is
oversubscribed


   By RICHARD GOURLAY


SHARES IN Celsis, a new medical diagnostic company, were yesterday placed at
100p, valuing the company that hopes to replace the laboratory agar plate,
at about Pounds 60m.
Panmure Gordon said the placing of 15m shares with institutions was
comfortably oversubscribed. The intermediaries offer of 7m shares, which
have been conditionally placed, closes on Friday.
The company will raise Pounds 12.4m from the float. Existing shareholders
have sold 9m shares.
In a novel development related to bio-technology and start-up companies, the
Stock Exchange has insisted that no existing shareholders can sell any of
their holdings for two years.
This condition forms part of new rules being developed to allow new bio-tech
companies to come to market without a track record.
Celsis is developing a system for rapid diagnosis of microbial contamination
which it hopes will replace the agar plate.
The company does not expect to launch the product till the end of next year
and will not make make significant profits until 1995.
COMMENT
Celsis has clearly generated strong support among institutions. Part of this
is no doubt the result of the impressive team Chris Evans, the founder, has
brought together. Part will stem from a desire to build a portfolio in the
new and potentially exciting bio-science sector, which seems also likely to
include a number of diagnostic companies. But companies like Celsis, with no
proven product, remain stocks to leave out of Granny's portfolio - unless
she is a high roller. Reasons for why Celsis should be valued at Pounds 60m
 -not Pounds 80m, Pounds 40m or less - are more elusive than brief
explanations of the use of bioluminescence reagents in microbe detection.
