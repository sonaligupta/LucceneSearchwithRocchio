FT  16 DEC 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Golf club drives at greater
accuracy


   By VANESSA HOULDER


An oversized, remodelled golf club could be the answer for golf enthusiasts
who yearn for greater accuracy and distance.
Spalding, a US equipment manufacturer, has designed a driver in which 20 per
cent of the weight of the head has been redistributed to its perimeter and
sole. The head's higher moment of inertia and lower centre of gravity gives
the ball less spin, allowing it to go further. The weight shift also makes
the driver more stable, helping the golfer attain greater accuracy.
The Top-Flite Magna Heat Driver, which is designed for mid-to-high handicap
golfers, will go on sale at the beginning of next year at around Pounds 99.
