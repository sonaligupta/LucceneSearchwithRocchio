FT  29 OCT 93 / International Company News: Cost-cutting helps recovery at
UAL and Delta


   By KAREN ZAGOR


   NEW YORK


THE BENEFITS of cost-cutting measures were reflected in the earnings of
United Airlines and Delta Airlines, two of the biggest US carriers, which
turned in sharply higher profits for the three months to September 30.
UAL, the parent company of United Airlines, posted third-quarter net income
of Dollars 149m, or Dollars 5.74 a primary share. Excluding extraordinary
items, it earned Dollars 159m, or Dollars 6.16, in the latest quarter. This
compares with earnings of Dollars 6m, or 27 cents, in the same period of
1992.
Mr Stephen Wolf, chairman and chief executive, attributed the improved
performance to the company's stringent cost-controlling measures, and to
stronger revenues on its longer haul routes.
United's shorter haul operations faced intense competition from low-cost
competitors, and produced a loss in the quarter.
'Despite the third-quarter profits, we will report a loss in the fourth
quarter and for the year as a whole,' Mr Wolf said. UAL's operating income
soared to Dollars 281m in the quarter, from Dollars 49m a year earlier.
Operating revenues were 11.6 per cent higher at Dollars 3.99bn, while
operating expenses rose 5.2 per cent to Dollars 3.71bn.
Delta also attributed its improved performance to efforts to reduce
expenses. Like United and the other big US carriers, Delta has been hit by
tough competition from lower-cost operators offering cheaper fares. In
September it offered early retirement to 3,000 staff.
Delta said yesterday that it expects about 1,400 to join the plan, and that
it would take a charge of about Dollars 100m in the second quarter to cover
the programme's costs.
For its fiscal first quarter, Delta recorded net income of Dollars 60.4m, or
65 cents, compared with a net loss of Dollars 125.2m, or Dollars 3.07, last
year.
Delta's operating income for the latest quarter was Dollars 121.5m before
accounting changes, against a loss of Dollars 194.7m a year earlier.
Mr Ronald Allen, Delta's chairman, said: 'We can celebrate the improvement
but we can't relax.'
