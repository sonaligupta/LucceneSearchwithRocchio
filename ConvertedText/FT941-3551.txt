FT  16 MAR 94 / Hedge fund row 'exaggerated'


   By AP-DJ


   FRANKFURT


The importance of hedge funds to the financial markets has been exaggerated
in the recent debate over whether such funds should be regulated, according
to Mr Edgar Meister, a member of the Bundesbank board. The main wish of the
world's central bankers, including the Bundesbank, was for more transparency
to observe more carefully the impact of the growing derivative business on
the markets, specifically on market interest rates and on money supply, Mr
Meister said. Hedge funds were only one of several powerful forces
contributing to turbulence in the bond markets. There were also mutual
funds, banks and brokers, Mr Meister said. Private investors should be
calmed by the fact that the volatility in the capital markets was only
temporary. Germany did not face big credit risks on account of hedge funds
because the borrowing activity of such funds was regulated and limited in
Germany, unlike in the US, Mr Meister said.
