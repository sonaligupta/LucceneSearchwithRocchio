FT  13 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Kuala Lumpur leads
region with 5.3% gain

Political uncertainty continued to keep investors on the sidelines, and the
Nikkei 225 average ended 1.3 per cent down on arbitrage-related selling,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index fluctuated narrowly, losing 249.75 at 19,648.33 after a day's high
of 19,884.78 and low of 19,647.63, its eventual decline also reflecting
profit-taking by some overseas investors.
Volume totalled 265m shares, against Monday's 224m. Most domestic investors
remained inactive, watching the political struggle to decide a successor as
prime minister to Mr Morihiro Hosokawa.
Meanwhile, the yen gained ground on speculative selling of the dollar,
breaching the Y103 level for the first time since April 5.
'The situation seems more unstable than most people had expected,' said Mr
Jim Vestal, chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd. However, he added
that the only immediately negative factor affecting the economy was the
instability of the yen, and the squeeze on earnings at export-oriented
manufacturers.
But some analysts were concerned that business confidence might start to
wane if the political instability drags on. 'The situation is disheartening
for the business community at a time when companies are trying hard to get
their act together,' said an official at a consumer electronics company.
The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 13.33 to 1,600.72, while
the Nikkei 300 declined 3.04 to 293.33. Falls outpaced advances by 715 to
300, with 136 issues unchanged. But in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on
1.01 at 1,313.95.
Some investors dabbled in small-lot shares but blue chips were hit by
profit-taking. Nippon Steel, the most active issue of the day, dipped Y9 to
Y341 and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone lost Y9,000 at Y892,000.
The rise in the yen hurt export-oriented high-technology issues, Hitachi
retreating Y11 to Y958 and Sony Y40 to Y5,920. But small-lot buying by
institutional investors supported some blue chip electricals, NEC rising Y20
to Y1,130 and Fujitsu Y10 to Y1,020.
Arbitrage selling weakened banks, Industrial Bank of Japan receding Y40 to
Y3,190 and Sumitomo Bank Y30 to Y2,220. Brokers were also lower, with Nomura
Securities falling Y50 to Y2,240.
In Osaka, the OSE average dipped 84.61 to 21,986.52 in volume of 12.6m
shares. Rohm, a leading semiconductor device maker, relinquished Y50 to
Y3,790 on profit-taking.
Roundup
Rebounds were seen in some regional markets as foreign demand revived. Mr
Peter Churchouse of Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong noted that Japanese funds
which had accumulated cash since the start of the year were finding some of
the Asian markets increasingly attractive, following declines of between 20
per cent to almost 30 per cent from their January peaks. Tokyo, conversely,
had risen by 30 per cent during the same period.
Bangkok and Jakarta were closed for public holidays.
KUALA LUMPUR jumped 5.3 per cent as foreign demand for blue chips sent the
composite index back through the 1,000 level. The index, which has fallen by
26 per cent since January 5, added 51.48 at 1,024.82, although brokers said
it was too early to tell whether the rise would be sustainable. Volume
surged to 199m shares from Monday's 86m.
HONG KONG climbed 2.8 per cent as foreign buying revived, the Hang Seng
index ending 261.32 up at 9,738.09. Turnover jumped to HKDollars 5.9bn from
the previous day's HKDollars 3.0bn.
Shares in Jardine group companies continued to rise after recent losses
stemming from the announcement of a delisting in Hong Kong. Jardine
Strategic gained HKDollars 1.70 at HKDollars 30.50 and Jardine Matheson
HKDollars 1.50 at HKDollars 56.50.
AUSTRALIA moved higher in late trading on strength in the futures market.
The All Ordinaries index was finally 19.1 ahead at 2,095.1 after touching
2,098.5. Turnover came to ADollars 542m.
The newly listed SGIO Insurance was the day's main story, finishing 19 cents
up from its issue price of ADollars 1.00, with some 20m shares changing
hands.
NEW ZEALAND was firmer, the NZSE-40 capital index putting on 28.18 at
2,151.87, helped by strong rises in Telecom, up 14 cents at NZDollars 5.18,
and Fletcher Challenge, 11 cents ahead at NZDollars 3.27.
KARACHI closed higher on new account buying in selected stocks of synthetics
and textiles. The KSE 100-share price index rose 7.73 to 2,470.84.
SEOUL failed to maintain its momentum as profits were taken after six
consecutive sessions of rises. The composite index dipped 13.60, or 1.5 per
cent, to 880.87.
BOMBAY rose on buying by foreign investors but mild profit-taking towards
the end pared gains, leaving the BSE 30-share index 50.38 up at 3,928.93.
