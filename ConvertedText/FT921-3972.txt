FT  11 MAR 92 / Observer: Tec-chy


Who's afraid of the pollsters? Answer: Michael Howard, Britain's Employment
Secretary.
Although his press office has spent some days denying the fact, it turns out
that Howard took time off from brawling with Labour's Jack Cunningham on the
radio last week to try to scupper an FT poll on attitudes to training.
To be precise, the FT has been asking directors of the Training and
Enterprise Councils, which Howard set up, how they think they are doing and
whether Labour would be good or bad for the training system.
Howard's response was to telephone business executives on G10, the group
which liaises between Whitehall and the Tecs.
According to a memorandum sent by Tom Booth, G10 representative for the
north west to the 14 Tecs he represents, Howard said some questions were
political in nature and offered a crude reminder of the Tecs' 'non-political
status'. No mention was made of the much touted independence of the Tecs.
Booth's response was to warn his fellow Tec directors to consider carefully
whether they should answer any questions (or the whole questionnaire) which
could be deemed to be 'politically sensitive'.
Unfortunately for Howard, over a third of all Tec directors canvassed,
including Booth, have already returned their forms.
We'll be glad to pass on their views to Howard on the Tecs' structure,
purpose and funding in due course. 'Frankly, I don't like being told what to
do by the Secretary of State,' says one aggrieved Tec director. 'If I'd had
any reservations about filling in the form before, which I did not, this
instruction would have driven me to fill it in straight away.'
