FT  01 DEC 94 / Iberia's pilots union rejects accord


Iberia's pilots union yesterday refused to accept an accord reached by
management and representatives of the carrier's two largest unions. After a
second day of talks, the union's chief negotiator said: 'The only viability
plan the company has put forward is one based solely on reducing salaries.
This is important, but it will not save the company. The company has to be
completely restructured.'
