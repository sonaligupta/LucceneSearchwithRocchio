FT  20 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: No easy money in libraries


   From Mr ROSS SHIMMON


Sir, So 'anyone can play with the idea of running a library' can they?
('Libraries up for grabs', April 13).
Public libraries are among the most popular and most heavily-used of public
services. They are an essential element in the quality of life of local
users.
They support the educational, leisure and business activities of their
communities. They are not political footballs or the playthings of 'bookish
entrepreneurs, management consultancies, retired librarians or leisure
companies'.
It is true that the government wishes to find out whether parts of public
library services or even whole services can be contracted out. We at the
Library Association are extremely sceptical as to whether they can be,
without adversely affecting the services they provide. The Brent initiative
is one of five schemes currently in progress and subject to monitoring by a
steering committee set up by the Department of National Heritage.
However public libraries are delivered in the future, the legal requirement
for local authorities to provide a 'comprehensive and efficient' library
service to all who live, work and study in the area remains - and the core
services have to be free at the point of delivery. So a contractor will be
required to ensure that they continue to provide such a service.
Nor is there a quick buck to be made in renting CDs or videos as mooted by
your correspondent - copyright legislation will prevent that.
