FT  11 MAR 94 / International Company News: Trelleborg to cut stake as
Falconbridge makes issue

Trelleborg, the Swedish metals group, is expected to cut substantially its
50 per cent interest in Falconbridge as part of a planned public share issue
by the Canadian base metals producer.
The size and terms of the issue are currently under discussion. However,
industry sources suggested that Falconbridge, which is at present owned
equally by Trelleborg and Noranda, the Canadian resources group, will seek
to raise at least CDollars 500m (USDollars 369m) in new equity.
Noranda said yesterday that it intended to maintain roughly its current
stake by subscribing for 45 to 50 per cent of the issue. But Trelleborg, in
a separate announcement, said that the two present shareholders' interest in
Falconbridge would drop to about 75 per cent.
Falconbridge is the western world's second biggest nickel producer, with six
nickel-copper mines near Sudbury, Ontario, a refinery in Norway, and a
ferro-nickel mining and metallurgical complex in the Dominican Republic. The
Kidd Creek zinc and copper complex in northern Ontario comprises another
large slice of Falconbridge's assets.
Falconbridge will use the proceeds of the public offering mainly to help
finance three large projects, namely, the Collahuasi copper property in
Chile, in which it has a one-third stake; the Raglan nickel-copper
development in northern Quebec; and the Nickel Rim project near Sudbury.
The company is also hoping to acquire another one-third stake in Collahuasi
presently held by the Royal Dutch Shell group. The remaining third is owned
by Minorco, the international resources arm of South Africa's Anglo American
group.
Noranda said that it would use existing financial resources and credit
facilities to finance its share of the proposed Falconbridge issue, and that
there would be no material increase in its debt burden.
