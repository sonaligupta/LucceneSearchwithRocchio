   ISLAMABAD


Ms Benazir Bhutto, the Pakistani opposition leader, will today attempt to
lead an anti-government protest march in the northern city of Peshawar to
step up pressure on Mr Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister, writes Farhan
Bokhari in Islamabad.
Ms Bhutto is likely to be stopped from going to Peshawar, a senior official
said last night. But her announcement signals that her latest campaign is
continuing.
