FT  14 APR 94 / International Capital Markets: More supervision of
derivatives urged


   By LAURIE MORSE


   CHICAGO


Mr Henry Gonzalez, chairman of the US House of Representatives banking
committee, yesterday introduced legislation that would give bank regulators
broader powers to supervise banks' derivatives dealings.
The Gonzalez bill requires full disclosure of bank derivatives activities
and would make improper management of derivatives or inadequate derivatives
disclosure by banks a direct violation of law.
The proposed legislation applies only to banks, and would not affect
derivatives dealings by securities firms, unsupervised derivatives dealing
subsidiaries, or hedge funds. However, Mr Gonzalez said that if banks engage
in fuller derivatives disclosure, 'other market participants will be forced
to follow because ratings agencies and other market participants will demand
matching disclosure.'
Regulation of this fast-growing sector of the financial markets has come
under renewed scrutiny this year because of losses by hedge funds on swaps
and other derivatives investments when bond prices tumbled in the first
quarter.
Although bank regulators, including a committee of the Bank for
International Settlement, have concluded that derivatives markets are
well-organised and sufficiently supervised, Mr Gonzalez, in introducing his
bill, said: 'It is the role of Congress to ensure that the regulators have
not erred in their assessment.'
Mr Gonzalez's bill is the second of its kind introduced in the House this
year. The first, offered by Mr James Leach of Iowa, is likely to be
superseded by Mr Gonzalez's initiative.
In addition to enhancing bank regulators' powers to supervise bank
derivatives activities, Mr Gonzalez's bill would require the General
Accounting Office to study the extent to which banks speculate in the
derivatives markets, and to look at the feasibility of imposing a
transaction tax or margin requirements on such activities.
