FT  20 JUL 94 / International Company News: Whirlpool turns in best-ever
earnings


   By ANDREW BAXTER


Whirlpool, the world's largest producer of white goods, yesterday announced
its best-ever quarterly earnings - and revenues that for the first time
exceeded Dollars 2bn for a three-month period.
Net income for the second quarter rose from Dollars 74m, or Dollars 1.04 a
share, to Dollars 84m, or Dollars 1.10, which included a 3 cents a share
restructuring charge. Revenues rose from Dollars 1.91bn to Dollars 2.05bn,
in spite of the sale this year of the company's European compressor
business.
Whirlpool's improved performance was broadly based. Second-quarter product
shipments in its North American Appliance Group rose at a double- digit
pace, as the company increased the combined market share of its KitchenAid,
Whirlpool and Roper brands.
Whirlpool Europe continued to increase market share by raising product
shipments in an 'essentially flat' market, compared with the second quarter
of 1993. In Latin America integration of manufacturing contributed to higher
total earnings from the region.
In the expanding Asian white goods market, Whirlpool's product shipments and
revenues grew at rates of about 40 per cent. But further spending on
expansion led to a quarterly loss, as expected.
Profits for the first six months rose to Dollars 151m, or Dollars 2, against
a net loss of Dollars 88m, or Dollars 1.23, a year earlier, reflecting
Dollars 220m of accounting charges.
