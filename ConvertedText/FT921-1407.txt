FT  24 MAR 92 / Rate of business failures slower in first quarter


   By DAVID BARCHARD


THE RATE of business failures in the UK slowed slightly in the first quarter
of this year, according to figures published yesterday by Trade Indemnity, a
leading independent credit insurance group.
It says business failures in the first quarter of this year will total about
1,985, an increase of 5 per cent on the fourth quarter of last year.
It is much slower than the increase in the corresponding period last year,
when business failures were up 84 per cent on the previous quarter. The peak
number of failures in a single quarter was last summer, since when quarterly
failure seems to have been on a plateau.
The 5 per cent increase for this year is encouraging because the first
quarter tends to have the highest number of business failures as companies
are hit by a slack market after Christmas and other seasonal problems,
including tax demands. In 1990 and last year, the first-quarter increase
over the previous quarter was 35 per cent and 41 per cent respectively.
The figures cover all business failures in the UK, other than those of
private individuals.
Trade Indemnity accompanied the figures with a warning that bad debts and
business failures this year are likely to remain at high levels.
Mr Clive Brand, senior economist at Trade Indemnity, said the slight upturn
was encouraging, but he still thought that business failures in the UK this
year would be at about the same level as last year.
Mr Brand said he did not expect much of an improvement next year. 'With the
uncertain economic situation, present levels of gearing and high level of
real interest rates, the severe financial pressures currently impacting on
the corporate sector will remain apparent until well into next year,' he
said.
