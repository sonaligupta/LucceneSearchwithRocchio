FT  13 NOV 93 / Trade accords 'will benefit US'


   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor


RATIFICATION of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Uruguay
Round of talks on trade liberalisation would bring substantial cumulative
benefits to the US economy, a survey of 35 economic forecasters concluded
this week.
It says that ratification of the Nafta, over the next 15 years, would raise
the real level of the US gross domestic product by 3 per cent. A successful
Gatt deal would add a further 4 per cent over the same period.
Conducted by the London-based Consensus Economics, the survey nevertheless
reflected considerable uncertainty about success either in next week's Nafta
vote in the US Congress, or in meeting the December 15 deadline for
completion of the Uruguay Round.
The US forecasters gave a 57 per cent chance that Congress would ratify the
Nafta, but assigned a bare 51 per cent chance of the Uruguay Round being
successfully completed.
The findings coincide with signs in the US of a swing in public opinion
behind the Nafta.
Public support for the pact has leapt from 34 per cent to 57 per cent in the
wake of a nationwide televised debate this week between Vice President Al
Gore, and Mr Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire who is a leading Nafta
opponent.
The Consensus Economics survey points to Nafta providing a Dollars 4.5bn
(Pounds 2.9bn) boost to US exports in the first year after ratification,
rising to an annual Dollars 13.2bn by the year 2005.
Gains from a successful Uruguay round outcome would be even more marked,
boosting exports by Dollars 6.5bn in year one, and more than Dollars 24bn by
2005.
US imports would rise, but less markedly.
The forecasters see the agreements trimming inflationary pressures, slowing
the rise in employment costs, and generating a 'small net increase' in jobs.
