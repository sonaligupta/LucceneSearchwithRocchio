FT  25 MAR 92 / International Company News: Italian foods group raises sales
15% to L2,754bn

BARILLA, the privately-owned Italian foods group which has been expanding
rapidly in recent years, raised group sales by 15 per cent to L2,754bn
(Dollars 2.19bn) in 1991 and expects turnover to reach L3,400bn this year.
Net profits in 1991 surged by almost 60 per cent to L155bn, representing a
significant recovery after two years of heavy investments on acquisitions
and investments in existing facilities, which had depressed earnings.
Barilla is Italy's biggest pasta-maker, and also has a substantial presence
in the market for biscuits and cakes.
Much of this year's forecast sales growth will stem from the expected
purchase of full control of Pavesi, a state-owned foods group, in which
Barilla bought a 49 per cent holding last year.
