FT  03 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Turkey-Libya oil-for-debt swap


   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN


   ANKARA


TURKEY and Libya have agreed an oil-for-debts swap to settle the Dollars
600m owed to Turkish contractors. The deal, signed after joint talks in
Ankara, ends more than three years of negotiations on Libyan payment
defaults to 35 Turkish companies.
The debts relate to business won in the early 1980s when Turkish contractors
concluded deals worth around Dollars 10bn building infrastructure for the
Libyan oil industry.
The oil-for-debts accord envisages delivery of 30,000 barrels a day, which
at current prices would settle the Dollars 200m of debts agreed with the
Libyan Treasury, in around 12 months. An additional Dollars 250m is owed to
companies, but not yet agreed with the Libyans. Turkish companies will also
receive 40 per cent of the project value in local Libyan currency.
Mr Barlas Turan, head of the contractors' union, said it would be a boost to
Libyan trade where Turkish contractors still have around Dollars 1.5bn of
continuing business. There was an undertaking to consider increasing the
shipments after 12 months.
The oil will be delivered to Tupras, Turkey's state-owned refinery at Izmit.
