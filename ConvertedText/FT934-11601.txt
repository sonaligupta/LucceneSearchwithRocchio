FT  30 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Lep reduces losses to Pounds 5.05m - Number
of debt-reduction possibilities under consideration


   By DAVID BLACKWELL


LEP GROUP, the freight forwarding and security company which was last year
restructured by its banks, has cut its interim pre-tax loss from Pounds
14.7m to Pounds 5.05m.
However, Mr David James, the company doctor who was appointed chairman by
the banks, yesterday reiterated the health warning he made at the AGM in
July.
'We don't feel the investing public has realised that there is no prospect
of a dividend in the foreseeable future,' he said.
The company was looking at a number of possibilities for the future, he
said, and might float off all or part of the equity in core businesses to
reduce its debt, which stood at Pounds 340m at the end of the first half.
The pre-tax outcome was struck after a Pounds 1.77m loss for the disposal of
property and Pounds 17.5m of net interest payable.
While the interest charge was down from a previous Pounds 23.7m, the company
said it was still high in relation to profitability. This reflected the fact
that the residual debt is attributable to losses on former activities and
discontinued operations.
Total operating profit rose from Pounds 13.4m to Pounds 14.3m. The latest
figure included a contribution of Pounds 71,000 from associates, compared
with a loss of Pounds 137,000 last time.
Mr James said the group's trading activities had benefited from the
stability following restructuring in August last year. This had helped
investment in the freight forwarding division, which would have a long-term
benefit.
Operating profits in the division fell from Pounds 6.52m to Pounds 3.45m.
However, the division is expected to be ahead in the full year as the latest
figure reflects an adjustment in the accounts for last year.
Operating profit at the National Guardian Corporation increased from Pounds
8.84m to Pounds 10.6m. The group said a small improvement in its trading
performance had been enhanced by the sterling-dollar exchange rate.
Total turnover was unchanged at Pounds 703m. However, last time's figure
included Pounds 8.42m from discontinued operations.
Losses per share fell from 12.7p to 0.7p.
