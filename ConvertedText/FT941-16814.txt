lens investment

   TAIPEI


Ciba-Geigy, the Swiss pharmaceutical group, plans to invest over Dollars 10m
to enter the Chinese contact lens and solutions market. Mr Chang Chih-hung,
general manager of Ciba Vision Taiwan, announced the decision in Taipei,
which is the site of the conglomerate's north-east Asia regional operating
headquarters.
The project, including supply of capital, technology and manager and
technician training, will be managed from Taipei.
Ciba Vision's initial investment plans will be divided into three phases.
During the first phase, beginning this year, Ciba will invest Dollars 4m to
set up Ciba Vision Shanghai for production and sales of contact lens and
solutions.
At first, finished lenses will be imported from the US until the Shanghai
plant's products are officially introduced into the market in 1995.
During the second stage, an additional Dollars 6m will be invested to set up
a contact lens care solutions factory in Beijing in co-operation with
Ciba-Geigy, its parent company.
In 1996, the Beijing facility will come on line. During the third stage,
Ciba Vision will set up sales outlets in the main Chinese cities.
Mr Chang said the company aimed to break even within four years and capture
over 25 per cent of the mainland Chinese market in contact lens and
solutions.
By that time, the group's annual sales should exceed TDollars 200m (Dollars
7.5m).
Ciba Vision carried out over 20 market surveys throughout China during the
past two years into consumer practices and habits.
Chang cited rising income levels, the liberalisation of the economic
structure and the gradual maturation of consumer health concepts and
education as key factors why Ciba chose this time to officially enter the
Chinese market.
