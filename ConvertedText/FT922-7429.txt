FT  19 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Gas unions reject 4% offer


   By MICHAEL SMITH


UNION leaders of 37,000 white-collar workers at British Gas yesterday
rejected an offer to increase pay by 4 per cent. The company had previously
offered 3.9 per cent, Michael Smith writes.
Mr Dave Stirzaker, national gas officer of Nalgo, with 37,000 members at
British Gas, said it was a skinflint offer that would damage staff morale.
The offer coincided with a report by Incomes Data Services, the pay research
organisation, showing most pay settlements in the second quarter of 1992 as
worth between 4 per cent and 5.9 per cent.
