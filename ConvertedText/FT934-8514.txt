FT  15 NOV 93 / International Company News: Canadian offer by Alusuisse

ALUSUISSE-LONZA Holding, the Swiss industrial group, is seeking to expand
its packaging interests with a CDollars 555m (USDollars 414m) bid for Lawson
Mardon Group of Toronto.
Alusuisse, advised by Baring Brothers, has offered to buy all Lawson's A and
B shares at CDollars 14 each. Cragnotti and Partners, the Italian investment
group, which currently has a 52.6 per cent voting interest in Lawson, equal
to 32.7 per cent of the equity, has agreed to tender its shares.
The CDollars 14-per-share price offered by Alusuisse is well above the
CDollars 9.88 at which Lawson was trading on the Toronto stock exchange
prior to the announcement.
Although Lawson has a relatively highly-geared balance sheet, with debts of
CDollars 350m, Alusuisse is understood to be attracted by its strong market
share in folding cartons, flexible packaging and labels.
Alusuisse said the proposed acquisition was in line with its focus on growth
in packaging and chemicals.
