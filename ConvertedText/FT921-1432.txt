FT  24 MAR 92 / Citicorp chief optimistic on debt


   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor


A LEADING international banker expressed optimism yesterday that an
agreement in principle could be signed within two weeks between commercial
banks and both Brazil and Argentina, Latin America's first and third most
indebted countries.
Mr William Rhodes, vice-chairman of Citicorp, which heads the bank advisory
committees to both countries, said such agreements would mark a 'landmark'
in the 10-year debt crisis.
Argentine government officials were yesterday to make a new debt
restructuring proposal to banks in New York. Mr Rhodes's comments followed
weekend telephone conversations with Mr Domingo Cavallo, the Argentine
economy minister. Brazil's chief debt negotiator, Mr Pedro Malan, said last
week he expected agreement in principle soon with banks.
'We are making good progress with both Brazil and Argentina. We could have
agreement with one or both governments by the Inter-American Development
Bank meeting,' Mr Rhodes said. The IADB holds its annual meeting in the
Dominican Republic on April 6 and 7.
'All parties - the governments, banks, the international financial
institutions and the G7 (Group of Seven) - now feel that the moment is
propitious to reach agreement,' he said.
Even if agreements in principle are quickly reached, final agreement will
take months. Both debt restructurings will take advantage of the Brady debt
reduction initiative in 1989 by Mr Nicholas Brady, US Treasury Secretary.
Banks are offered a variety of options, most of which involve exchanging
debt for new concessional bonds.
Argentina and Brazil appear likely to settle on a discount on the
concessional bonds of around 35 per cent, the level gained by Mexico two
years ago.
