FT  22 JUL 93 / Wales and south-west continue to recover


   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent


THE RECOVERY is continuing in Wales and south-west England, according to the
latest quarterly surveys by chambers of commerce.
Manufacturing is leading recovery in Wales with exporting companies showing
similar growth to the previous quarter, says the Wales Chamber of Commerce
and Industry.
A significant change is that 50 per cent of manufacturers report an increase
in home sales. The service sector is still lagging, with 38 per cent of
companies showing growth but 23 per cent declining.
Overall, confidence is high, with two-thirds of companies expecting improved
sales in the next 12 months. Thirty per cent of companies have increased
their investment plans for capital equipment.
An increase in investment plans is also reported in the south-west. A survey
by the Bristol Chamber of Commerce and Initiative says that nearly one in
three manufacturing companies plan to increase investment, with fewer than
one in 10 intending to cut it. In the service sector more than one in four
have increased investment plans, with 6 per cent planning cuts.
More than 60 per cent of companies have seen increases in sales in the last
quarter, with less than 10 per cent registering falls. Nearly half of
manufacturing companies say exports and orders are up, with about one in six
reporting falls.
In both regions smaller businesses plan to employ more staff. Larger
manufacturers are still shedding staffing.
