FT  12 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Whitegate Leisure goes Pounds 1.1m into the
red


   By PEGGY HOLLINGER


SOARING interest charges forced Whitegate Leisure, the bowling alley and
discotheque company, into the red with losses of Pounds 1.1m for the year to
December 31, compared with a profit of Pounds 1.1m last time.
Interest charges shot up by 80 per cent to Pounds 4.1m, with borrowings of
Pounds 31m at the end of the year. The group reassured shareholders that it
was trading within its banking facilities.
The result was further depressed by extraordinary provisions of Pounds 8.5m
(Pounds 1.6m). The charges were taken to cover expected losses on the
disposal of the group's French leisure business and nursing homes
subsidiary.
An exceptional write-down on assets and the costs of restructuring totalled
Pounds 784,000.
Mr Nick Oppenheim, chairman, said the group had an 'unsatisfactory year',
despite cutting administration costs by Pounds 1.2m to Pounds 2.5m. Turnover
at Pounds 24.1m (Pounds 21.7m) had been below expectations.
As a result the group was passing the dividend payment. Last year, Whitegate
paid 1.5p.
The loss per share was 4.2p, compared with a profit of 3.3p last time.
Mr Oppenheim said Whitegate intended to reduce its 90 per cent gearing
through the disposal of non-core assets. However, he warned that such sales
would take time in the current depressed climate.
Mr Oppenheim was giving his final statement as chairman of Whitegate. He
will resign at the annual general meeting, to be replaced by Mr Alexander
Cassells, a chartered accountant.
