   PORT-AU-PRINCE


A group of pro-military senators vowed yesterday to install a new president
of Haiti to replace Mr Jean-Bertrand Aristide later this week, Reuter
reports from Port-au-Prince.
The eight senators, who were elected after the military ousted Mr Aristide
in a coup in September 1991, passed a resolution in the Haitian Senate on
Sunday declaring that the presidency was vacant.
