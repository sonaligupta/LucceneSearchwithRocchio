FT  03 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Yeoman restructuring plan


   By PHILIP COGGAN


YEOMAN Investment Trust has announced plans for a restructuring which will
extend the life of the trust until 1999.
The trust was due to be wound up this year, after having been converted into
a split capital trust in 1986.
Capital shareholders will be offered the chance to convert their shares into
new zero dividend preference shares at liquidation asset value (the value
they would have received has the trust been wound up). The liquidation asset
value will be set on August 18.
The new zero dividend shares will entitle holders to receive an annual gross
redemption yield of 10 per cent over the lifetime of the trust.
Some capital shareholders may want to realise their holdings for cash.
Accordingly Yeoman has agreed to find purchasers for the new zero dividend
shares, up to a total of Pounds 23.5m. Yeoman has also agreed to place 1m
zero dividend shares.
