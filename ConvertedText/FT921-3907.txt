FT  12 MAR 92 / Observer: Foot in it


Things are looking up for Richard Stein, finance director of Standard
Chartered Bank. Yesterday he was able to announce financial results which in
most respects were superior to those of the English clearers - it is some
time since that has been the case.
But an even greater boost to his esteem is that, for the first time in his
career, someone has considered his signature worthy of forgery - though not
very well by all accounts. The Dollars 500m fraud attempt had no chance of
success. Anyone with any knowledge of the bank would have known that as
finance director he never signs loan documents.
However, this is by no means the most audacious attempt at fraud ever faced
by the bank. A while ago in the Middle East, the bank had an illiterate
customer who signed with a thumb print. A criminal, now in gaol, tried to
forge the signature - but used a big-toe print instead.
Caught on the hop?
