FT  22 JUL 94 / International Company News: Norwegian shipowner cuts
forecast after halfway slide


   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES


Leif Hoegh, one of Norway's top shipowners, has reduced its forecast for
1994 after first half profits after financial items slumped to NKr129m
(Dollars 19m) from NKr213m.
The company blamed a weaker contribution from its car carrying activities
and a bigger-than-expected loss at Cool Carriers, a newly-acquired
refrigerated cargo operation. It also said that a dry-docking programme for
some of its liner vessels had taken more time than anticipated.
The group expects profits after financial items of around NKr200m for the
full year, NKr100m less than earlier forecast. Net profits are expected to
be NKr250m.
First-half freight revenues expanded to NKr1.46bn from NKr1.22bn, but
operating profits fell to NKr76m from NKr176m. Net profits were NKr142m,
compared with NKr339m. However, the 1993 figure included a NKr258m profit
from the sale of two car carriers.
Hoegh's second quarter profit after financial items was NKr36m on freight
revenues of NKr740m. Net profit was NKr48m.
