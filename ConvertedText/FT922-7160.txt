FT  20 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Conservative accounting leaves HCI with
Pounds 21.4m loss


   By PETER PEARSE


HOSPITAL Corporation International Group, has reported pre-tax losses of
Pounds 21.4m for the nine months to December 31. The company was created in
January when Hospital Corporation International of the US reversed into
Bioplan Holdings, the UK healthcare group.
Operating losses of Pounds 2.82m were swelled by Pounds 16.8m of exceptional
charges, derived mainly from the new management's adoption of a more
conservative approach to Bioplan's accounting policies.
The write-downs on overall property asset values went deeper than had been
anticipated at the time of the merger and the capitalised interest and
capitalised overheads have been reversed out. Restated pre-tax losses for
the 15 months to March 31 1991 were Pounds 113,000.
Mr Dennis Sokol, chief executive since the merger and chairman since
February, said that Bioplan's evaluations of its hospitals were overstated.
In spite of its Pounds 22.3m rights issue in May 1991, raised to fund the
hospital building programmes, the group ran into 'considerable financial
difficulties' in the latter half of 1991. Its shares were suspended at 44p
in November. They closed at 15 1/2 p yesterday, down 1/2 p.
Mr Sokol said that HCI Group was 'now a real company, rather than a
development business'. He has restructured the board, bringing in Mr James
Mills-Webb, formerly finance director at AMI Healthcare, as finance
director, and Mr Anthony Bryan, Sir David Rowe-Ham and Sir Ronald Grierson,
as non-executives.
Mr Sokol said the company was in partnership with the NHS in 70 per cent of
its hospitals and that it now had 37 per cent more beds, on an annualised
basis, than last time, though he conceded that occupancy needed building.
Turnover in the nine months totalled Pounds 11.1m (Pounds 16.3m for 15
months). An extraordinary charge of Pounds 1.26m related to losses on the
sale of Bioplan's furniture business. This led to losses for the period of
Pounds 22.7m (Pounds 1.47m). Losses per share emerged at 54.9p (earnings
4.6p).
