FT  01 DEC 94 / The Budget: Tax loophole on share gains closed


A tax loophole allowing investors to make unlimited tax-free gains from UK
shares was closed yesterday, just a few weeks after it became generally
known.
The chancellor announced plans to ensure that gains from securities linked
to share indices could not escape the tax net. Up to now this has been
possible if the securities were structured as both qualifying corporate
bonds, which are capital gains tax exempt, and qualifying indexed
securities, which are exempt from income tax on gains.
Most qualifying indexed securities are linked to the retail prices index, or
some other measure of inflation, but the current rules also allow for
linkage to a UK equity index.
The loophole was spotted and exploited earlier this month by Fidelity
Investment Management, with loan stock issued by Fidelity Special Values, a
new investment trust.
