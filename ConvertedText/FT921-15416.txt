FT  10 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Buoyant AMD sees leap in
sales

ADVANCED Micro Devices, the Silicon Valley semi-conductor manufacturer,
reported a surge in fourth-quarter sales and a 'virtual stampede of
customers' ordering its version of the 386 micro-processor, the chip used to
power many of the most popular personal computer models.
'In an otherwise lacklustre semiconductor market, all of AMD's growth came
from micro-processors,' said Mr WJ Sanders, chairman and chief executive.
Last year, AMD mounted a challenge to rival Intel's dominance of the
personal computer microprocessor market by launching its own versions of
Intel's widely-used 386 chips.
The companies are involved in a series of complex legal disputes over AMD's
rights to produce the microprocessors.
Fourth-quarter revenues rose by nearly 38 per cent from the like period a
year ago. AMD reported record revenues of Dollars 366.2m and net income of
Dollars 106.7m before payment of preferred stock dividends.
After the preferred dividend, quarterly net income was Dollars 1.17 per
common share. Operating results for the quarter included a charge of Dollars
7m in connection with previously-announced plans to close down one of the
company's oldest production lines in the second quarter of 1992.
The results also included a net gain equivalent to 52 cents per common share
from sales of assets, primarily the sale of 3.5m shares of Xilinx, another
US chip maker.
In the fourth quarter of 1990, AMD reported revenues of Dollars 265.9m and a
net loss of Dollars 43m, or 55 cents a share, after dividend payments.
The loss included a charge of Dollars 27.7m, for an adverse judgment in
patent litigation with Brooktree. AMD is appealing the court decision.
For fiscal 1991 AMD reported revenues of Dollars 1.2bn, up 16 per cent from
Dollars 1.1bn in 1990. Net income for the year was Dollars 145.3m, or
Dollars 1.53 per common share after preferred dividends.
This compared with a net loss of Dollars 53.6m, or 78 cents a share, after
dividends in 1990.
'In the final quarter of 1991, we more than doubled sales of Am386 products
to over Dollars 145m,' said Mr Sanders.
'AMD expects continued double-digit growth in the current quarter, driven by
microprocessor sales. I expect the remainder of AMD's business will be
essentially flat, reflecting the continued sluggishness in the economy,' he
concluded.
