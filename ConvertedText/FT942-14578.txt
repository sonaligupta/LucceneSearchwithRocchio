Over a third of the 20,000 Australian coal-miners who went on strike
yesterday have been ordered back to work by the Coal Industry Tribunal. The
order followed applications by the Queensland Mining Council and Powercol, a
New South Wales-based producer, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney.
Separately, Peabody Resources, which is owned by Britain's Hanson group,
asked the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to allow it to pursue a
damages claim against the miners' union.
