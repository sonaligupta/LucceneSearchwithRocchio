FT  01 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: An intellectual tyranny


   From Dr ANNE-CAROLE CHAMIER


Sir, Joe Rogaly argues that political correctness, in moderation, 'is
socially beneficial' ('All present and correct', November 26). Tact,
discretion, respect for others, diplomatic language, kindness and decency
have always been valued by the civilised; but they have little to do with
political correctness.
There is nothing moderate about pc. It is an intellectual tyranny that gags
open, rational discussion. It is the hallmark of a closed society that has
lost interest in the pursuit of objective truth. Far from promoting
tolerance and understanding, the repressions demanded by pc increase
paranoia, mistrust, ignorance and hatred. The enemies of political
correctness, whatever their political allegiance, are the friends of
intellectual freedom.
