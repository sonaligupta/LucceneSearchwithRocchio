FT  13 NOV 93 / Tourism to Israel expected to double


   By JULIAN OZANNE

THE BENEFITS of peace on the Israeli economy will far surpass any negative
impact, according to the first report on implications of peace carried out
by Bank Hapoalim, Israel's largest banking group.
Israel will gain from increased tourism, which accounts for a quarter of all
foreign currency revenues and earned Israel Dollars 1.8bn (Pounds 1.22bn)
last year. It is expected to expand dramatically with a doubling of the
number of visitors forecast for next year.
The main negative impact will be the threat to Israel's textile, poultry and
vegetable sectors from cheap imports from the Palestinian entity.
The bank is more optimistic than many Israeli economists about the impact on
Israeli-Arab trade after the lifting of the Arab boycott. It says the
economic potential of the Arab countries is too great to ignore.
A specific dividend will be the import of cheap oil and gas from Arab states
directly, lowering Israel's energy costs.
The removal of the secondary and tertiary Arab boycott, which places
sanctions against companies that do business with Israel and companies that
deal with companies that trade with Israel will be more significant and
yield results quickly.
The bank adds that Israel will benefit by the influx of Dollars 2bn of aid
into the Palestinian economy over the next five years as Palestinians turn
to Israel for consulting services, raw materials, technology and Israel's
financial system.
Israel yesterday received some of the first concrete political and economic
dividends from its peace accord when Zimbabwe said it was establishing full
diplomatic relations with the Jewish state and Tunisia ended the ban on
Israeli tourists.
Both moves, part of a gradual easing of Israel's isolation by Arab and third
world countries, will help win popular support in Israel for the peace
process.
