FT  20 APR 94 / Restructuring charge set to wipe out LIG's net assets


   By MAGGIE URRY


London International Group faces the near elimination of its net assets by a
'very substantial' restructuring charge for the year to March, according to
a statement issued yesterday.
In March 1993 shareholders' funds stood at Pounds 119.1m. The group, which
makes Durex condoms and Biogel and Marigold gloves, yesterday confirmed the
need to refinance. Its shares fell 8p to 121p.
The restructuring, foreshadowed in December, includes the closure of three
UK plants and the loss of 1,000 jobs at a cost of Pounds 19m, followed by
another 1,000 job losses worldwide.
LIG said it had appointed Mr Michael Moore as chairman to replace Mr Alan
Woltz, who is retiring. Mr Moore is chairman of Tomkins, Quicks Group and
Linx Printing Technologies, and of the NSPCC, the children's charity.
The group said it had sold its Buttercup, Liqufruta and Galloway's cough
mixture brands to Pfizer of the US for Pounds 11.2m, compared with a book
value of Pounds 500,000. It had also made progress towards disposing of its
ColourCare International photoprocessing activity.
The photoprocessing business, built up through acquisition at a cost of
Pounds 65m, has a book value of about Pounds 28m. One analyst said: 'It's
not so much what they can get for it, as how much it will cost to get rid of
it.'
As a result of the expected exceptional losses, Mr Nick Hodges, chief
executive, confirmed that the group would need a sizeable equity injection
through a refinancing. But this could not be finalised until the terms of
the photoprocessing sale had been agreed. New equity could come from
existing shareholders, a debt into equity swap or both.
The group's debt was Pounds 127.7m in the last accounts, but rose to Pounds
153.9m by the interim stage. Shareholders' funds dropped to Pounds 109.4m
following an after-tax loss of Pounds 7.5m for the six months. Analysts
expect the group to make a small pre-exceptional loss for the year.
