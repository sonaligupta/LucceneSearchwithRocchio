FT  25 AUG 92 / International Company News: Elf tumbles 23% at interim stage

ELF AQUITAINE, the state-controlled French oil group, yesterday added to the
gloom in France's corporate sector by announcing a 23 per cent fall in
recurring net income to FFr3.3bn (Dollars 676m) in the first half of 1992
from FFr4.3bn in the same period in 1991.
The fall reflects the depressed tone of the stream of first-half results
from French companies.
Elf announced its interim results after the market closed and its share
price slipped by just FFr6.4 to FFr309.8 during the day.
The company, one of the first candidates for the French government's partial
privatisation programme with the FFr2.08bn sale of 2.3 per cent of its
shares, was hit in the first half by the general climate of economic
uncertainty, together with the weakness of the US dollar and of refined oil
prices.
Group sales rose to FFr98.86bn from FFr92.73bn but operating income slipped
to FFr7.91bn from FFr9.87bn (including an exceptional profit of FFr1.01bn on
the sale of Esys).
Earnings per share fell to FFr13 from FFr21.
The strongest area of activity was exploration and production where
operating income rose to FFr5.06bn from FFr4.54bn, chiefly because of an
increase in crude oil production sold and a reduction in exploration
expenses.
The only other division to muster an increase in income was human health
with a rise to FFr916m from FFr721m.
The refining division saw operating income fall to FFr580m from FFr2.69bn
(including the Esys profit), reflecting the reduction in margins from the
artificially high levels during the Gulf war in the first quarter of last
year.
Chemicals also suffered from a fall in margins, but limited the fall in
income to FFr1.31bn from FFr1.86bn. The eliminations division reported a
reduction in income to FFr43m from FFr53m.
