FT  13 APR 94 / Third of Tecs part with chief


   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff


More than one third of training and enterprise council chief executives have
resigned or been sacked since Tecs were established four years ago,
according to figures disclosed by the Department of Employment yesterday.
The first Tecs were established in April 1990 to administer
government-funded training and to foster enterprise. Of 82 chief executives
recruited during the past four years, 35 have quit. Some 20 of these were
seconded civil servants, while 15 came from a variety of backgrounds,
including the private sector.
Civil servants, many of whom had worked in the Department of Employment's
Training Agency, which handed over responsibility to Tecs, accounted for 46
of the original chief executives.
The Tecs had been asked to give the Training Agency's civil servants first
consideration when appointing chief executives. After three years with a
Tec, the civil servants had an option to return to the Department of
Employment.
The department denies that the high turnover indicates a failure in the
recruitment policy of the Tecs' boards, composed mainly of private-sector
senior executives. 'There was not a model for these new jobs,' the
department said. 'They require people who understand both the commercial and
public sectors and the interface between them.'
A Tec chief executive can command a salary of between Pounds 35,000 and
Pounds 55,000 plus benefits.
In a recent study of Tecs, Mr Bob Bennett of the London School of Economics
said that Tecs were heavily dependent on the personal effectiveness of their
chief executive.
