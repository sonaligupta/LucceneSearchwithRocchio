FT  07 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Airbus sees 13.7% rise in turnover


   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent


Airbus Industrie, the European aircraft manufacturing consortium, yesterday
reported a 13.7 per cent rise in turnover to Dollars 8.3bn last year from
Dollars 7.3bn in 1992 despite a fall in deliveries and an even steeper drop
in new orders.
Although deliveries fell from 154 aircraft in 1992 to 138 aircraft last
year, the increased turnover reflected a shift in the pattern of deliveries
with a bigger proportion of higher value widebody aircraft following the
entry into airline service of the new Airbus A340 and A330 widebody
airliners.
Airbus suffered 69 cancellations last year while new orders fell sharply to
38 aircraft from 136 in 1992, the group said.
The figures did not include orders for six A340s from Cathay Pacific and a
further six A340s from Air Canada.
Airbus also announced yesterday its first orders for 1994 with Air Inter,
the domestic French carrier owned by Air France, ordering nine A319
narrowbody airliners worth around Dollars 340m and taking options on an
additional nine.
The consortium, whose partners include Aerospatiale of France, Deutsche
Aerospace, British Aerospace and Casa of Spain, described 1993 as 'one of
the most difficult years on record' but said there were now signs of
stabilisation in the air transport market.
Airbus is also expected to have made an operating profit last year after
making an operating surplus of around Dollars 250m in 1992.
However, it said its policy of rigorous order book management had enabled it
to make less brutal production adjustments compared with its main US
competitor, Boeing.
The consortium's revised production schedule will see deliveries fall to 134
aircraft this year, pick up to 138 in 1995 (the same as last year), and then
rise to 154 in 1996, returning to the same level as in 1992.
Boeing, for its part, has cut its production rate by around 30 per cent from
32.5 aircraft a month at the beginning of last year to 23 aircraft last
month. Boeing's monthly output will drop to 21 aircraft next month and then
to 19.5 aircraft in November and to 18.5 aircraft in January 1995.
But the US manufacturer had a considerably stronger new aircraft order
intake last year than Airbus, reflecting in part the launch of its new 737X
narrowbody airliner and the new 767 freighter aircraft as well as the order
build-up for its new 777 wide-body twin-engine airliner.
Overall, Boeing won new orders for 246 aircraft worth Dollars 16.59bn last
year compared with new orders for 243 aircraft worth Dollars 17.77bn in
1992.
Airbus said it would continue to monitor closely the evolution of the
market, making further changes to its production plans when necessary. It
also expected to see a recovery in the market in the second half of the
decade.
With a large order backlog of 667 aircraft worth Dollars 55.4bn at the end
of last year, Airbus said it had four years of production in hand. By
comparison, Boeing had an order backlog of more than 1,150 aircraft at the
end of last year.
Airbus said it believed it was strongly placed to take advantage of the
recovery with its expanded and comprehensive family of aircraft. Its target
was to capture well over 30 per cent of the world airliner market in the
second half of the decade.
