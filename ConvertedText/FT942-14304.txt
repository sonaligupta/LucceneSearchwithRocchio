FT  21 APR 94 / Housing starts bounce back after US winter

   WASHINGTON


US housing starts rebounded sharply last month after a winter hiatus caused
by exceptionally cold weather, official figures indicated yesterday.
Starts rose 12 per cent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
1.47m.
This was 35 per cent higher than the figure in March last year, but still
well below the recent peak of 1.61m starts in December.
Housing rebounded in all regions, with the biggest gains recorded in the
Midwest, where starts rose 30 per cent from February.
Building permits, which offer a guide to future construction activity, rose
5 per cent last month.
With demographic trends less favourable than in the 1980s and mortgage rates
now rising, analysts are growing sceptical about how much scope there is for
further big gains in starts.
The March jump could be the 'last hurrah' for this cyclical sector, said Mr
David Munro, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, a New York
consultancy.
Analysts at C J Lawrence, a New York brokerage, said starts would probably
fluctuate around the March level, averaging 1.4m-1.5m this year.
