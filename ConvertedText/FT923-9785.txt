   BANGKOK


Nepali troops yesterday found the wreckage of the Thai Airways Airbus which
smashed into a mountain north-west of Kathmandu on Friday with 113 people
aboard. They said it had exploded in flames, apparently killing everyone,
Reuter reports from Bangkok.
A Thai Airways information officer in Bangkok said a transcript of the final
conversations between the crew of Flight TG311 and the Kathmandu control
tower had been given to the airline by Nepal's civil aviation department.
'The pilot twice said there were technical problems and asked for permission
to go to Calcutta,' Mr Weera Kitchathorn, the airline's president, was
reported as saying.
The aircraft was on a scheduled flight from Bangkok to Kathmandu and
disappeared in bad weather shortly before it was due to land.
