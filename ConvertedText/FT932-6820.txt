FT  26 MAY 93 / International Company News: RWE to take holding in Endesa


   By TOM BURNS


   MADRID


RWE, the German electricity utility, is to take a stake of between 4 and 5
per cent in Endesa, the state-controlled Spanish generator and distributor.
Endesa recently paid Dollars 217m for a 2 per cent stake in RWE. At current
stock market prices, the RWE share purchase could total Dollars 467m. It
will make RWE the biggest foreign shareholder in a Spanish electricity
group.
The share purchases form part of a wide-ranging agreement between the two
utilities, which are seeking to pool research facilities and develop joint
ventures. Both are heavy users of coal-fired plants.
The agreement between the two utilities was signed last year shortly after
Tractabel of Belgium bought 3 per cent of Iberdrola, the private-sector
Spanish generator which, together with Endesa, controls the bulk of Spain's
domestic electricity market.
Mr Feliciano Fuster, Endesa chairman, said his company had still to decide
on whether to increase its stake in the German utility.
