FT  21 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Tunnel shares at new low


   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN and JEFFREY BROWN


Eurotunnel plunged to a new low for the year, losing 12 at 199p in heavy
volume. Turnover in Paris was 9m shares, but for once it was the London
volume that caught the eye with 3.5m shares changing hands in what traders
described as a serious weight of selling.
Not helped by yesterday's press trip train failure, the awesome downtrend in
the shares - they were Pounds 6 earlier this year - is a direct reflection
of the bearish sentiment that has built up this week in the wake of the
group's sharply reduced 1994 revenue forecast.
There were clear signs yesterday that UK shareholders - 25 per cent of the
shares are held on this side of the Channel with the majority owned by
Continental holders - were being shaken out as the stock came within sight
of its 184p all-time low.
Eurotunnel has forecast that its revenue for this year will be around Pounds
34m: analysts suspect it needs above Pounds 700m to cover the cost of its
borrowings.
