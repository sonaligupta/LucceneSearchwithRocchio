FT  06 JUN 92 / Gardening: Plant of the Week


   By ARTHUR HELLYER


Paeonia suffruticosa This is the moutan, the most opulent of the shrubby
peonies, which has been developed highly in gardens, both in China - where
it is native - and in other parts of the world. The flowers of the wild
plant are single and usually white, with a big maroon blotch at the base of
each broad petal and a cluster of yellow stamens in the centre. But garden
varieties can be pink, red or magenta and may be semi or fully
double-flowered.
All tend to make rather leggy bushes, a habit that can be improved by
careful pruning after flowering. They like good, humus-rich soil and a
sheltered position where they wll not be exposed to spring frosts which can
damage the young growth, although mature stems and leaves are hardy.
