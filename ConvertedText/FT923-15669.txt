FT  01 JUL 92 / UK Company News: BOC ends US home healthcare involvement


BOC Group, the UK industrial gases and healthcare concern, has ended its
costly involvement in the US home healthcare market by agreeing to sell its
Glasrock business.
BOC will sell Glasrock to Homedco Group, a California-based company, for
Dollars 72m (Pounds 39m), slightly above its net asset value after dediction
of liabilities. However, the UK group took an exceptional provision of
Pounds 19.6m for the year to September 30, to cover a reorganisation of
Glasrock.
BOC bought the business in 1983, hoping to benefit from the increasing
numbers of patients being treated at home. However, the business came under
pressure from cuts in US federal funding for healthcare and offered few
economies of scale.
