FT  28 SEP 94 / People: Graham quits Specialeyes


Differences of opinion on the board of Specialeyes, the loss-making
USM-traded retail optician, have led to the resignation of Robert Graham,
the retail operations director.
Although Graham's resignation does not signal a split on the board, he is
believed to have had a difference of opinion over how the company should
cope with an increasingly competitive market and lower margins.
Specialeyes has seen a number of board changes in the past two years. The
most recent was the resignation in May of George Shand, the financial
director.
Mark Raines, Specialeyes managing director, assumes Graham's
responsibilities.
Graham, formerly retail operations director of Habitat, joined Specialeyes
in September last year. Specialeyes said at the time that his appointment
'completes the restructuring of the executive team'.
Specialeyes incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 481,000 for the 12 months
ended November 27 on a turnover from continuing activities of Pounds 20.54m.
The figures compared with Pounds 2.27m and Pounds 25.94m respectively for
the 78 weeks to November 28 1992.
