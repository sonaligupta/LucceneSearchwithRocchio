FT  24 OCT 94 / Slovaks yawn at referendum


   By REUTER


   Bratislava
A dismally low turnout has invalidated a referendum in Slovakia aimed at
fighting corruption in privatisation of state property. Only 19.96 per cent
of Slovakia's 3.8m registered voters cast ballots in Saturday's referendum,
far below the 51 per cent turnout required for a valid vote. The referendum
was demanded by left-wing parties to stiffen laws on purchase of state
property. The initiative was meant to answer suspicions that illegally
obtained funds have been used in the purchase of state property since
communism fell in 1989.
One of the referendum's staunchest supporters, ex-premier Vladimir Meciar,
said he wanted the referendum to trigger a law that would open
investigations of past purchases of state-owned property. Critics of the
referendum said it was simply a ploy by some left-wing parties, including Mr
Meciar's party, to whip up popular support during the recent election
campaign.
