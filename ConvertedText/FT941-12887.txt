FT  28 JAN 94 / Spanish strike sparks clashes


Spanish riot police clashed with pickets in Madrid yesterday as trade unions
staged a 24-hour nationwide strike in protest at the government's plans to
reform the labour market. There were similar incidents in other cities, with
dozens of people reported injured.
The unions claimed that 8m workers took part in the stoppage but employers
said 70 per cent of businesses operated normally.
