FT  16 DEC 94 / Survey of World Commercial Vehicles (2): Industry looks
forward to significant growth - Europe, finally emerging from four years of
recession


   By KEVIN DONE


The west European truck industry is finally emerging from four years of
recession, although the recovery remains hesitant. Demand has picked up
strongly in markets such as those in the UK and Scandinavia, but these
increases have been offset by the continuing weakness of sales in Germany
and Italy.
The pattern of the recovery has led to a wide divergence in the performance
of individual European producers, with some groups such as Mercedes-Benz,
Iveco, and MAN still struggling to emerge from losses in Europe, while
others such as Volvo and Scania, the two Swedish truck makers, are already
experiencing a spectacular jump in profits.
Truck sales in western Europe (above 6 tonnes gross vehicle weight) began to
fall in 1990 from a peak of 296,000 in 1989, and the decline became
precipitous in 1993 with sales falling by 22.8 per cent to only 192,000,
according to the latest report by DRI/McGraw-Hill, the UK-based automotive
analysts.
During 1994, manufacturers have become increasingly confident that the worst
of the recession has been passed, however, and producers are now forecasting
several years of significant growth to the end of the 1990s.
According to the latest DRI World Truck Industry Forecast report truck sales
(above 6 tonnes) are expected to rise by 3.9 per cent this year to 199,000,
and demand is expected to strengthen in 1995 and 1996 with growth of around
10 per cent in both years. 'Most national markets have joined the recovery
process in Europe after the worst downturn on record,' says the DRI report.
Western European truck sales are forecast to rise further in the second half
of the 1990s to reach 272,000 by 1999, although this will still be below the
1989 peak.
The recovery has been led by the UK, which was also one of the first markets
to fall into recession. In 1992, UK truck sales fell to 31,398, the lowest
level since the mid-1950s, from a peak of 69,234 in 1989.
In the first 11 months this year UK truck sales (above 3.5 tonnes) have
jumped by 23 per cent, following an increase of 15.8 per cent in 1993, and
the industry is confident that this improvement will be sustained next year.
The sharpest contrast with the UK is provided by Germany, where sales
accelerated to a peak in 1991 in the wake of reunification - offsetting the
early onset of recession in markets such as the UK and France - only to
decline abruptly in the past three years.
DRI forecasts that the 'turning point could soon be reached' in Germany,
too, however. The decline in truck sales eased further in the third quarter
of 1994 with a year-on-year fall of 6 per cent, leaving sales in the first
nine months 10.1 per cent lower than in the corresponding period a year ago.
By contrast with the hesitant recovery in overall sales across western
Europe, truck production has recovered strongly with DRI forecasting a rise
of 18.1 per cent to 251,000 following the drop of 27.2 per cent last year.
Output was depressed last year by low demand and by excess stocks. By 1994,
the heavy constraint of surplus stocks had been removed, however, and truck
makers have also been gearing up to meet stronger levels of demand not only
in Europe but also in overseas markets, in particular in Latin America and
Asia.
Against this background the two Swedish truck makers, Volvo and Scania, have
benefited most with their competitiveness enhanced by the weakness of the
Swedish currency, as well as by the tough restructuring measures taken
during the recession.
Scania, the specialist heavy truck maker (16 tonnes and above), increased
its truck and bus sales worldwide in the first nine months by 28 per cent to
23,500 from 18,400 in the corresponding period a year earlier. The volume of
its order bookings rose by 61 per cent during the first nine months to
29,100 trucks and buses from 18,100, while operating income recovered to
SKr2.448bn from only SKr311m a year earlier.
A similar transformation has been achieved by Volvo Truck, where operating
profits in the first nine months surged to SKr2.697bn from only SKr183m a
year earlier.
Daf, the Dutch truck maker, which collapsed into receivership in early 1993
as the most notable victim of the recession, is also regaining some lost
ground, after its heavy truck operations in Holland and Belgium were rescued
by the Dutch and Flemish governments. In the first six months of this year
it achieved a net profit of Fl39.2m.
Since the rescue in March 1993 it has been able to increase its workforce
from 3,500 to 4,200 with production at its Eindhoven plant up by more than
half compared with 1993. It has recently taken on about 200 temporary
production staff at sites in the Netherlands and Belgium in response to
rising demand.
With the continuing weakness of the German market, Mercedes-Benz and MAN
Nutzfahrzeuge, the leading German truckmakers, have taken longer to emerge
from recession.
Mercedes-Benz's commercial vehicle operations are expected to suffer an
operating loss for a second year in succession in 1994, according to Bernd
Gottschalk, managing director of the group's commercial vehicle division.
However, he forecasts a return to profit in 1995.
MAN suffered a pre-tax loss of DM80m in its latest financial year to the end
of June, but the company is also forecasting a return to profit in the
current year. Its profitability has declined sharply during the past three
years with the 1993/94 loss following pre-tax profits of DM61m in 1992/93
and DM506m in 1991/92.
The company has restructured under the pressure of recession, and Rudolf
Rupprecht, chief executive, says the group has again been operating
profitably in recent months. It forecasts vehicle deliveries in the current
financial year will rise to 37,000-38,000 from 33,000 last year.
Despite the start of recovery this year Helmut Werner, Mercedes-Benz chief
executive, warned recently that the European truck industry was still facing
'enormous excess production capacity', which was likely to grow further due
to productivity increases. Current output of trucks (above 6 tonnes) was
using less than 60 per cent of the available capacity in the industry, he
said.
'The consequences are highly aggressive competition and a battle over prices
and conditions which continues to cause serious problems,' he said.
Part of Mercedes-Benz's response to this pressure is a plan to reduce
radically the share of in-house production in its commercial vehicle
operations, which is to be cut from 42 to 36 per cent.
