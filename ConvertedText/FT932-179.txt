FT  30 JUN 93 / Small companies suffer as failures increase


   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent


A SURGE in company failures among small traders throughout the UK has pushed
business collapses to a record. The figures underline the fragile state of
much of industry in spite of signs of recovery.
Taking in England, Wales and Scotland, business collapses totalled 17,005 in
the second quarter of this year, Dun & Bradstreet, the business information
company, said yesterday. This is the highest three-monthly figure since Dun
& Bradstreet started collecting data in 1980.
The collapses are mainly at the level of small businesses, which are going
under at the rate of nearly 1,000 a week throughout the country.
Separately, the Bankruptcy Association yesterday said that personal
bankruptcies in Britain have continued to increase in the first six months
of 1993 - rising 12.5 per cent on the same period last year to 21,678. The
association said the rise in personal bankruptcies was being fuelled
increasingly by professional groups, such as accountants and solicitors,
going under in the wake of clients.
The overall Dun & Bradstreet second-quarter figure was inflated largely
because Scottish business failures rose 35 per cent between the first and
second quarters, from 2,795 to 3,770. In England and Wales, the upward trend
is much less marked, although business failures still rose 5 per cent from
12,648 in the first quarter to 13,235 in the second quarter. In the fourth
quarter of last year the figure was 13,397.
The year-on-year rate of collapses is coming down in London, and has
increased only marginally in south-east England, while Wales has seen a big
fall.
This supports notions that the regions which were first into the recession
are ahead of others in coming out of it.
In the first six months, total failures came to 32,448, from 62,767 in the
whole of last year. Between January and March this year 15,443 businesses
went under.
Throughout the country, big companies appear to be relatively resilient as
they attempt to rebuild sales after the recession. This is highlighted by
the 5,430 limited companies being liquidated in the second quarter - a muted
2 per cent rise on the 5,297 forced out of business in the first three
months.
Bankruptcies of small traders went up 14 per cent from 10,146 to 11,575 over
the same period.
Taking in the whole of the first half of this year, 25,883 businesses
collapsed in England and Wales - little changed on the 25,683 in the
comparable time last year.
London had 3,381 failures, down 2 per cent on the same period in 1992.
