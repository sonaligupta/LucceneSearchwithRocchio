Saga


   By MARTIN BRICE


An Dollars 850m seven-year revolving credit facility for Saga Petroleum,
Norway's largest independent oil producer, was signed yesterday in London,
writes Martin Brice.
Banks offered to lend a total of Dollars 1.26bn, but the loan was not
increased from its original Dollars 850m target.
The loan was arranged by ABM Amro Bank, Barclays Syndications and Deutsche
Bank.
Saga was formed in 1972, has a BBB+/Baa3 credit rating and plans to apply
for a stock exchange listing in the US in spring.
