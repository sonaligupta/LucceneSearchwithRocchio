FT  11 NOV 92 / International Company News: Hafslund buys Dutch
pharmaceutical group

HAFSLUND Nycomed, the Norwegian radiology products group, is paying Dollars
94m for Christiaens International, a Dutch pharmaceutical group.
In the last three years Hafslund has spent NKr3.2bn (Dollars 497m) on
expansion, mainly in Europe, and last month acquired a small Spanish
pharmaceuticals company.
Last year some 77 per cent of group turnover came from outside Norway, but
this will increase to more than 80 per cent with the latest acquisitions.
Yesterday's deal strengthens the group's sales and distribution network
while establishing a solid presence in the Benelux region.
Christiaens, which is being acquired by Hafslund's Nycomed Pharma unit -
itself the largest pharmaceutical supplier in Norway and Denmark - is a
holding company for a group of pharmaceuticals companies in Belgium and
Holland.
It has a workforce of 258 and expects turnover for 1992 to rise to NKr300m
from NKr260m in 1991. Hafslund will market its medical imaging and
therapeutics products through Christiaens' distribution network.
