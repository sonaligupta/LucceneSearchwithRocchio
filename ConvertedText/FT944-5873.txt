FT  01 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Andrews Sykes Pounds 2m in red


As warned of in August, exceptional costs of Pounds 2m connected to its
reorganisation kept Andrews Sykes, the industrial services group, in the red
to the tune of Pounds 1.96m in the first half.
Turnover increased to Pounds 26.3m (Pounds 25.1m) and operating profit was
45 per cent up at Pounds 602,000 (Pounds 415,000) in the six months to
September 30. The exceptional item included the write-off of fixtures and
fittings, plant and machinery and redundancies due to the closure of two
sites.
Discontinued operations contributed Pounds 555,000 (Pounds 539,000), from
turnover of Pounds 4.45m (Pounds 5.08m), but interest payments took Pounds
932,000 (Pounds 820,000).
The previous first half carried a pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.34m, after losses
of Pounds 2.05m on the sale and closure of discontinued activities.
Losses per share 16.6p (19.4p).
The group said that during the period under review, the workforce had been
reduced by about 15 per cent.
There are plans for further non-core disposals and asset realisations.
