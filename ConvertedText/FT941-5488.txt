FT  05 MAR 94 / A dizzy fall from the heights: Financial Times Round the
World Ski Expedition


   By ARNIE WILSON


Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are trying to ski every day of 1994 on a
round-the-world expedition. They spent February in North America.
We had expected the US southern states and the mid-west to be different from
Colorado, but we hadn't realised quite how different. We should have guessed
from the enormous altitude change - almost 13,000ft at Breckenridge to
scarcely 1,000ft above the Mississippi at Mount Lacrosse, Wisconsin.
Here, ski resorts are sited in the most ridiculous places. Cloudmont in
Alabama, for example, is tiny, pretty and bizarre and if there were a
competition for really small ski areas, I would hand it first prize straight
away because it is kept going against all odds.
Lucy Dicker, my companion on this round-the-world ski expedition, and I had
the honour of being the last skiers this winter to descend the only run at
Cloudmont with enough snow on it to remain open. And when Cloudmont closes
for skiing, so does Alabama.
Cloudmont, in a peaceful wooded vale not far from Chattanooga, has a
vertical drop of just 150ft and only one 'pony' tow, with no chairlifts. And
there are just two runs: half of the gently sloping fields that make up the
skiing terrain is for intermediates; the other half is the nursery slope.
During our visit, the beginners' slope had melted completely, and only 90ft
remained of the intermediate slope.
But then you might think it miraculous that Alabama can manage a ski resort
at all, let alone one which next winter will celebrate its quarter century
as the only ski area Alabama has ever had.
Normally Cloudmont gets just 12 inches of snow a year, an inch or two at a
time. Gary Jones, who runs Cloudmont with six relations and a few friends,
makes nearly all the snow himself.
February has turned out to be a month of feast or famine for our adventure:
we caught Colorado at its best and the Mid-West at its most unpredictable -
a week before we arrived at Ski Butler in Kentucky there had been a
heatwave.
During the month we have featured in some strange-sounding newspapers, such
as the Idaho Falls Post Register, the Ashland Daily Tidings, and the Record
Searchlight.
One headline read: 'Surgery can't stop ski writer.' Our mission to ski every
day of 1994 came under threat in Paoli Peaks, Indiana, when I required
inconvenient minor surgery. While recovering, Lucy and I made a daily
pilgrimage to Paoli and, rather gingerly, skied one run just to keep our
record intact.
Earlier in the month, at Montana's Big Mountain, we took a Snow Cat tour,
travelling in an old gondola bolted onto the Cat - a Heath Robinson device.
And at Big Sky the sun came out and warmed the bones which had been so
chilled the previous week. It was a day of fast cruising mixed with some
more adventurous and steeper terrain off the recently opened Challenger Quad
chair.
One special area I was anxious to try in Ski the Summit's resorts was the
latest addition to the skiing terrain at Breckenridge, Peak 7. Unlike Peaks
8, 9 and 10, this mountain has no lifts, is completely ungroomed, and
involves a tough 30-minute hike followed by a serious descent through a
steep and often deep snowfield.
My hands and feet were frozen when I got to the top, and all I could think
about was getting out of the piercing wind, but as we started our descent,
several things started happening at once. Lucy fell almost immediately, and
in my eagerness to help her I promptly took a tumble myself, temporarily
losing a ski.
Then I found my goggles had frozen over inside my jacket and Lucy told me
that my nose had turned white with frostbite. We managed to pick ourselves
up and, trying hard to keep my nose covered, we skied out of the wind. For
two weeks my nose looked as if it had been left out for too long in the
Caribbean. It has only just healed.
Our last day's skiing in Colorado until we return in December was a morning
of Cat skiing at Ski Cooper.
And so to our dizzy fall from the heights of Colorado to the lows of
Wisconsin: in the Rockies, when it rains in the ski village there is a
strong chance that it will be snowing higher up. In the mid-west states
there is usually no higher up. If it is raining low down, it is almost
certainly raining on the slopes too. Skiing in torrential rain was one thing
we hadn't really bargained for.
That evening - still in pouring rain - we skied at Cascade Mountain.
Strangely, once committed to skiing in the rain it feels quite snug under
your hood, hat and goggles. It was only when we had completed five miles in
the two resorts (not easy with a vertical drop of only 500ft or less) that
we realised quite how drenched we were.
At Mount Lacrosse, Wisconsin, pain in my left foot became a major problem
and I had four people crowding round me - Ted Motschman, owner, Tom
Caspersen, rental manager, and Matt Kleppe, head boot-fitter, plus Bruce
Erdmann, orthopaedic specialist - to advise about my crippled foot. My boot
was successfully 'blown out' and I have now stopped limping.
On the outskirts of Chicago, the ski 'resorts' get even smaller. Villa
Olivia's vertical drop is only 180ft. And we arrived at Four Lakes Village
to find a vertical drop of just 100ft and no lifts - only tow ropes.
While most skiers would prefer to ski in the Alps or Rockies, this does not
mean that all ski areas have to be huge or even anywhere near a mountain. As
long as it is cold enough to make snow at night you could build a ski area
just about anywhere - and these states prove it.
In Indiana and Kentucky, four resorts are fighting in the same unlikely
catchment area: Paoli Peaks, Ski World, Perfect Slopes and Ski Butler. Their
winter season can be as short as 90 days or even less, and to make the most
of the snow they make there is night skiing - even all-night at weekends.
Paoli Peaks, run by a Swiss couple, Felix and Margarit Wurmli-Kagi, is
probably the best of the four areas and they certainly make the best snow.
Felix is a snow-making boffin and has even patented his own snow-making
machine.
Having just caught Cloudmont in time, we now head for North Carolina via
Chattanooga. We must make haste, because to the resorts it is already spring
and the snow is melting fast . . . .
