FT  28 APR 94 / Risky manoeuvres in the fast lane: John Burton and Kevin
Done examine the global ambitions of a rapidly expanding Korean car industry


   By JOHN BURTON and KEVIN DONE


Korean vehicle makers are appearing at uncomfortable speed in the rear-view
mirrors of their rivals from North America, Europe and Japan.
With stunning disregard for warnings from western carmakers about
overcapacity in the world auto industry, the leading Korean producers are
expanding assembly capacity at a rate that recalls the startling growth of
the Japanese industry in earlier decades.
The announcement by Kia, the second-largest Korean carmaker, that it plans
to start assembly of four-wheel-drive sports/utility vehicles in Germany -
the vehicles will be assembled by Karmann, the German automotive engineering
group - is the latest move to mark Korea's rapid advance into world auto
markets.
Supported by a rapidly growing, and until now highly protected, domestic
market, Hyundai, Kia and Daewoo are determined to break into the industry's
front ranks. Exports, both to developing countries and to the established
regions of North America and Europe, are growing, as is the scope of plans
for foreign assembly plants.
Hyundai Motor, the leading South Korean carmaker, plans to increase vehicle
production capacity by 60 per cent to 2m units by 2000 from 1.25m at
present, according to Mr Se Yung Chung, group chairman. It is planning to
build more foreign production sites to reinforce its presence in overseas
markets, he says.
'We envisage manufacturing operations in North America, Europe, south-east
Asia and in the Middle East.'
Individually Hyundai, Kia and Daewoo are all voicing the ambition of
becoming one of the world's top 10 producers, an aim that would mean
shouldering aside the likes of Mitsubishi, Mazda, Chrysler or Fiat.
The threat of a growing tide of Korean exports allied to the high barriers
to foreign car imports in the domestic market, where imports accounted for
well below 1 per cent last year, are rapidly forcing the issue of Korean
expansion towards the top of European carmakers' agenda.
'South Korea, one of east Asia's 'tigers' has been pursuing an aggressive
export policy, which seems set to disrupt markets, not only for the
Europeans and Americans, but also for the Japanese themselves, who are being
hurt by the high yen, and from whom the Koreans have learned a great deal,'
the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (Acea) warned this week.
Kia has just launched its cars into the US for the first time under its own
brand name. Mr Greg Warner, executive vice-president of Kia Motors America,
states openly that the key to the company's launch strategy will be
'disruption', as it seeks to under-price its rivals by a significant margin.
'Our greatest impact will be on Japanese makes,' says Mr Warner. Kia's first
US television advertising campaign has featured clips from a 1960s science
fiction film Gorgo, with a gigantic monster trampling across the buildings
of a city centre to the accompaniment of screams. 'There's only one thing
more frightening to Japan,' says the text, 'A well-built car for under
Dollars 8,500.'
The Korean government is playing a key role in the auto industry's
expansion. In a glittering ceremony Hyundai Motor recently unveiled the
Accent, the successor to the country's most popular car model, the Excel
small family car.
As the first Korean car to be based entirely on domestic technology, the
Accent represents a significant success for the government-sponsored X-5
programme. Started in 1991, X-5's goal is to transform Korea into the
world's fifth-biggest vehicle producer, after Japan, the US, Germany and
France, by 2000.
The government estimates that it will cost Dollars 36bn, financed by soft
state loans, to achieve this. Sixty per cent of these funds are going into
doubling production capacity to 4.65m vehicles by the end of the decade. The
rest is earmarked for research projects, such as the development of electric
cars.
Korea is well ahead of schedule: it may become the fifth-largest producer
this year by overtaking Canada. It will produce 2.4m cars and commercial
vehicles versus Canada's 2.35m, according to forecasts by the the Hyundai
Automobile Research Institute. It predicts that Korea will exceed French
vehicle production by 2000.
The increase reflects buoyant exports, which reached a record 640,000
vehicles last year, as Korean producers gained a price advantage over their
Japanese rivals, thanks to a 20 per cent fall in the value of the Korean won
against the yen. The continued weakness of the Korean currency means exports
may reach 800,000 vehicles this year.
Despite the undoubted alarm among western carmakers, some industry observers
believe that the fears are exaggerated. They predict that the Korean car
industry is racing towards problems of its own, which could leave it with
excess production capacity and force consolidation. 'The Koreans are betting
on a lot of positive factors that may prove false,' says Mr David Bloom,
manager of the Seoul office of Hawtal Whiting, the UK automotive engineering
consultants.
One cause of concern is the increasingly cut-throat competition in the
domestic market, which accounts for 70 per cent of total sales by Korean car
companies. The offer of low-interest consumer financing by car companies to
boost demand has depressed profit growth.
In addition, productivity improvement has been made difficult by industrial
action, which shut down Hyundai plants for almost two months last spring.
Domestic competition is expected to become more intense in the next few
years. Ssangyong, which produces commercial and four-wheel-drive vehicles,
will enter the passenger car market in 1996, with a range of cars that it
will produce in co-operation with Mercedes-Benz of Germany. Samsung, one of
the nation's biggest industrial groups, is also seeking to move into car
manufacturing. It is negotiating with Toyota and Nissan of Japan on
technical support for the project, which it is estimated would cost at least
Dollars 6bn.
The optimistic Korean vehicle makers argue that there is still plenty of
room for growth. Only 35 per cent of Korean families own a car and some
companies believe they can double this number.
There are signs that domestic demand is weakening, however. The rate of
growth in sales in Korea has slowed from 40 per cent a year in the late
1980s to 18 per cent last year.
Adding to domestic pressures are the growing demands from Korea's trading
partners for barriers to imports to be dismantled. Korea held foreign car
sales last year to about 4,000 vehicles - only 0.2 per cent of total
domestic sales - through special taxes on imported 'luxury' models and by
making intimidating tax audits of foreign car buyers.
While imports make no inroads at home, exports already account for half of
production, with Korean vehicle makers gaining ground fast in the developing
world. Half of Korea's car exports go to the Third World, up from only 7 per
cent five years ago. All three leading companies are erecting assembly
plants in Asia, the Middle East, Africa and eastern Europe.
Korean cars can compete better in the developing world, where price is more
important than quality. Complaints in the US about the quality of Korean
cars blunted an export boom in the late 1980s.
But the Big Three are not neglecting the US and west Europe, and are
expanding their sales and marketing operations in these markets. Hyundai has
been established for several years in these regions, but it has now been
joined by Kia, and Daewoo plans to enter west Europe in 1995 and the US a
year later.
'The strategy of the Koreans is clear. They hope to use the Third World as
their main market for the next decade, giving them time to improve the
quality of their cars and finish preparations for a bigger marketing
presence in the US and Europe,' says Mr Don Lee, motor industry analyst for
BZW Securities in Seoul.
Korea has previously taken great risks in rapidly expanding such industries
as shipbuilding and semiconductors in spite of warnings that it was creating
a production glut. The gloomy predictions proved false and these industries
now enjoy growing prosperity. Korean carmakers are betting that their gamble
may prove as successful.
