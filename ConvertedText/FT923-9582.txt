FT  04 AUG 92 / Peace with guerrillas in Surinamese accord


   By REUTER


   PARAMARIBO


GUERRILLA groups and the Surinamese government yesterday reached a peace
accord to restore the prosperity and political stability of the South
American country, Reuter reports from Paramaribo.
Hundreds of insurgents, who first took up arms in 1986 to topple what was
then a military regime, agreed to surrender their weapons within two weeks,
negotiators said.
Guerrillas and the military are to be granted an amnesty over human rights
abuses, including executions by soldiers of critics and suspected rebel
sympathisers.
A blanket amnesty for both sides was opposed by some members of the present
government but it was deemed necessary for a lasting peace to be respected
by the army commander, Colonel Desi Bouterse, who led coups in 1980 and
1990.
Col Bouterse ruled Surinam for eight years before ceding power to civilians
in 1988.
