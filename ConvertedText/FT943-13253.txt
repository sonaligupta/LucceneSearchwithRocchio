FT  20 JUL 94 / International Company News: US banks produce mixed results


   By RICHARD WATERS

Chemical Banking lifted underlying post-tax profits 9 per cent in the second
quarter as a lower loan loss provision helped to offset the effects of lower
revenues from trading in financial markets.
However, the headline profit figure fell to Dollars 357m, or Dollars 1.28 a
share, from Dollars 381m, or Dollars 1.35, a year earlier when the bank had
benefited from Dollars 54m of one-off tax benefits.
Total revenues fell during the second quarter as net interest income edged
up just Dollars 10m to Dollars 1.185bn and non-interest income dropped
Dollars 175m to Dollars 867m.
The non-interest figure was affected by a decline in trading revenues to
Dollars 203m, from Dollars 298m the year before.
The bank blamed 'difficult conditions in certain markets,' including
emerging country debt, European government bonds and foreign exchange
markets, for the decline. Also, the year-ago period benefited from a one-off
gain of Dollars 44m from the sale of Brazilian bonds.
Loan loss provisions dropped from Dollars 205m to Dollars 160m.
Mr Walter Shipley, chairman and chief executive, said the bank was
benefiting from 'a further improvement in . . . risk profile, including a
substantial reduction in non-performing assets and another sharp decline in
our provision and other credit costs'.
The bank's return on equity dropped from 15.97 per cent the year before to
13.9 per cent, behind the level achieved by many of its peers. Post-tax
profits for the first half as a whole were Dollars 676m, down from Dollars
720m.
BancOne, the Ohio-based regional banking group, reported a sharp fall in its
net interest margin during the second three months of the year as US
interest rates were ratcheted up.
The bank's margin had been buoyed in recent periods by its use of interest
rate swaps to enhance earnings, an effect which ended with the rate rises.
The net interest margin fell from 6.29 per cent a year ago to 5.51 per cent.
The decline was partly due to increasing competition among banks to make
loans, which had driven down the pricing, the bank said. It added that it
had reversed its treasury policy to make itself less vulnerable to future
interest rate rises.
Net income for the period rose 12 per cent to Dollars 316m, or 81 cents a
share, from Dollars 282m, or 73 cents, the year before.
A gradual recovery in the Californian economy, after three-and-a-half years
of recession, helped San Francisco-based Wells Fargo record a 38 per cent
rise in second quarter net income, to Dollars 206m, or Dollars 3.57 a share,
from Dollars 149m, or Dollars 2.46, the year before.
Pointing to what he called a weak economic recovery, Mr Carl Reichardt,
chairman and chief executive, said loan balances had risen for the second
consecutive quarter, and were now 3 per cent higher than at the end of 1993.
The recovery also added to a fall in the quarterly loan loss provision, to
Dollars 60m from Dollars 140m.
Lower-yielding assets pushed the net interest margin down from 5.71 per cent
to 5.56 per cent. However, Wells Fargo still managed a return on equity of
21.67 per cent.
