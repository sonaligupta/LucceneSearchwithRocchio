FT  23 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Low prices snuff out tobacco
hopes - Tony Hawkins on a stunning setback for Zimbabwean growers


   By TONY HAWKINS


HAVING GROWN possibly the best flue-cured tobacco crop in the country's
history, Zimbabwean farmers have been stunned by depressed prices on the
Harare auction floors.
When the tobacco sales opened last week growers were optimistic that prices
would open in the region of USDollars 1.50 a kilogram and hopeful that
during the season they would average Dollars 2 a kg. But on the first day
the price averaged Dollars 1.29. falling below Dollars 1 on the third day
and sliding still further this week to average only Dollars 1.05 during the
first week of the sales. That was 34 per cent down on last year's opening
price of Dollars 1.60 a kilogram for what was a low quality, high-nicotine,
drought-stressed crop.
Growers had been warned that the global supply-demand balance had shifted
against them and that prices this year would come under pressure, but no-one
expected so dramatic a decline, especially given the sharp improvement in
the quality of tobacco on offer. 'We are shell-shocked,' said an industry
official this week.
There is no single explanation for this. Global recession, higher taxes on
smoking, cigarette price wars in the US and EC and the increased
availability of some grades, especially filler tobaccos, have all
contributed to thin order books. The Brazilian crop is up nearly 10 per cent
at 400m kg, but, unlike Zimbabwe, the quality is poor.
Zimbabwe's farmers are highly critical of the government's monetary policy,
which they say has killed the speculation that would normally have resulted
in heavy buying by the merchants.
They have a point. Repeated government promises to curb public spending and
reduce the budget deficit have come to nothing and economists expect the
1992-93 budget deficit to exceed 12 per cent of GDP or roughly double the
target in Zimbabwe's structural adjustment programme.
In an effort to meet credit ceilings agreed with the IMF, while also
accommodating the government's borrowing requirements, the Reserve (central)
Bank of Zimbabwe, which in December promised lower interest rates, has been
forced to allow money market rates to rise. Merchants are therefore faced
with the choice of paying upwards of 40 per cent interest to buy and hold
speculative tobacco or borrow offshore at much lower rates, carrying the
foreign exchange risk of further Zimbabwe dollar devaluation as well as the
probability of being unable to sell and move the tobacco before the loan is
repaid in 180 days.
The result has been market stalemate; merchants awaiting orders from the
manufacturers who traditionally only show their hand in the market in the
second half of May or even later, while the growers, indignant at being
forced to 'give' their tobacco away at bargain basement prices are
withdrawing from the market in the hope that prices will soon recover.
Caught in the middle is the monopoly auction floor company, Tobacco Sales,
with too much tobacco to store as a result of confident pre-season bookings
and subsequent large-scale tearing of tickets, thereby rejecting sales, by
growers. At the same time farmers are scrambling to cancel next month's
bookings and hold their tobacco back in the hope that when the manufacturers
see the quality of the leaf they will start buying heavily.
Watching gloomily from the sidelines are the banks. They had hoped for
buoyant sales, both to boost national export earnings and to ease market
liquidity as tobacco growers repaid their loans.
It is estimated that the break-even price for a tobacco farmer is in the
region of Dollars 1.50 to Dollars 1.60 a kilogram, depending on the yield
achieved. After last year's disastrous drought, when the banks were forced
to carry a large number of their customers, a second successive season of
loan roll-overs would push up lending rates once again.
With less than 2 per cent of the crop having been sold, it is far too early
even to begin to guess what the price will average this season. Were the
authorities to open a tobacco window at the central bank to finance
speculative buying, this might give prices a modest boost. Merchants play
this down, however, stressing that the real problem is not the liquidity
crunch at home so much as weak global demand.
Last year the industry produced 201m kg of tobacco, which sold at an average
price of Dollars 1.62 a kg, only half the Dollars 3.25 achieved in the 1991
boom. Current forecasts point to a crop of at least 205m kg this year with
price estimates for the season ranging from Dollars 1.40 from the
doom-merchants to the optimists' Dollars 1.75. Unless market conditions
change radically in the next two months, the probability must be that the
1993 crop will earn little more than last year's Dollars 326m, less than the
Dollars 350m achieved in 1990 and substantially below the record Dollars
553m enjoyed in 1991.
With tobacco accounting for 40 per cent of export earnings last year, and
with mining and industrial exports suffering at the hand of world recession,
another year of depressed prices would deflate the dwindling hopes of a
significant economic recovery in 1993.
In any event, tobacco exports this year will be sharply lower than in 1992
because the foreign sales in the first half the year will be dominated by
last year's poor quality low-priced leaf. But a second successive year of
low prices would delay Zimbabwe's export recovery by at least 12 months as
well as reversing the trend towards increased tobacco production if growers
came to accept that the 1991 boom really was no more than a flash in the
pan.
