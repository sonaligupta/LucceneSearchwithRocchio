FT  27 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Scottish bus group's Asia deal


   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent


WALTER Alexander, the Scottish-based bus builder, yesterday announced Pounds
15m worth of orders for double-deck buses from Singapore and Hong Kong.
The orders confirm a recovery for the company which in mid-1991 had to put
many of its staff on a three-day week and was forced to make others
redundant.
Walter Alexander will supply 85 air-conditioned double-deck buses to Citybus
in Hong Kong, and provide 200 double-deck bus kits for assembly in
Singapore.
The orders, which will be completed in October 1993, mean that exports at
present account for some 50 per cent of Walter Alexander's order book.
This year it has exported more than 140 buses to foreign customers and is
building Peoplemovers for Honolulu international airport, Hawaii, having
supplied similar vehicles for Atlanta and Miami.
Mr Ian Galloway, chief executive, said that partly because of overseas
orders, Walter Alexander is now having to work overtime at its plant at
Falkirk where it employs 610 people. It also employs 154 people in Belfast.
The company recently recruited 100 people in Falkirk and is now constrained
by the number of skilled coachbuilders it can find. It is taking on 30-40
extra people in Belfast.
It expects to deliver between Pounds 32m and Pounds 33m of buses this year,
and expects sales to reach Pounds 45m next year, of which Pounds 36m have
already been ordered.
Mr Galloway said that the domestic market in the UK was showing some signs
of recovery, although bus operators were ordering fewer than half the 2,000
buses they needed to order each year to upgrade their fleets.
The company had been helped by the closure last winter of some of the
bus-making capacity of its UK rivals.
In April, Mr Galloway led a Pounds 7.4m management buyout of Water Alexander
from Spotlaunch, a company formed in 1990 by the finance company Granville
to buy the entire Walter Alexander group, which was then quoted on the stock
exchange.
