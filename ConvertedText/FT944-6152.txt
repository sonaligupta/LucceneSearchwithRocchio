FT  30 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Rise in beer sales helps Marston to Pounds
12.3m


   By DAVID BLACKWELL


An increase in beer sales volumes in spite of a fall in the overall market
helped Marston, Thompson & Evershed, the Burton-based regional brewer, to
lift interim profits by 6.5 per cent.
For the six months to September 24 pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 11.5m to
Pounds 12.3m, while sales grew from Pounds 70.1m to Pounds 76.6m.
The latest figure was struck after charging a Pounds 43,000 loss on property
disposal and Pounds 251,000 costs for the share ownership scheme.
The shares fell 12p to 292p as the group warned of volatile trading
conditions. It was 'relatively cautious' about second-half prospects.
Volume sales of beer rose by 3.3 per cent in the first half, compared with a
claimed fall of 1 per cent across the industry. Sales of the group's
Pedigree bitter were 1.6 per cent ahead, while sales of the Low 'C brand of
low calorie bottled beer were up by 16 per cent.
Mr David Gordon, managing director, said the results showed 'steady growth.'
The group was outperforming the market in beer sales, and the managed houses
and food sales were doing well.
Sales in the 240 managed houses were 16.2 per cent higher, while food sales
increased by 18 per cent. However, sales from the tenanted estate of 640
pubs were down 4.5 per cent.
Net interest payable rose from Pounds 304,000 to Pounds 761,000, reflecting
increased borrowings after the purchase of 46 pubs from Bass in September
last year. Gearing has risen from 8.8 to 10.2 per cent.
The group said the results from the former Bass pubs, many of which had been
closed for refurbishment, had more than covered the cost of borrowing. So
far three have been fully developed, and a further 13 are expected to be
completed by the end of the year.
Earnings per share rose from 8.71p to 9.91p and the interim dividend goes up
from 1.6p to 1.76p.
COMMENT
While these results were at the bottom of City expectations, it was the
cautious trading statement that knocked the shares back. Operating profits
were up almost 13 per cent to Pounds 13.3m, reflecting the underlying
soundness of the business. It has reciprocal agreements with the big
breweries, a strong portfolio of managed houses, and it is probably ahead of
the game in its approach to the tenanted sector, where it has a good
investment programme. Profits for the full year look like coming in at
Pounds 25.5m, giving a prospective multiple of just over 14 - a little too
high following the cold water poured on the second-half outlook.
