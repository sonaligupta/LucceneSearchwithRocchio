FT  19 APR 94 / Recovery is hesitant, say Yorkshire area chambers


   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent


The recovery is 'hesitant and unexciting', says the latest quarterly survey
by the Yorkshire and Humberside region's 13 chambers of commerce and
industry.
A similar picture was revealed in the north-west last week with results from
11 chambers suggesting the recovery was uneven and faltering.
Some 1,221 companies took part in the Yorkshire and Humberside survey. The
results showed slowly rising sales in home and export markets since the
third quarter of 1992.
The overall picture is healthy with nearly a third of companies working at
full capacity, said Mr Ian Kelly of Leeds and Bradford Chamber Services,
which co-ordinated the survey. However, orders are faltering slightly, Mr
Kelly warned.
Service companies showed faster sales growth than manufacturers in home
markets in the first quarter of the year while manufacturers did better in
exports.
Confidence remained generally high, with most companies expecting
profitability to improve in the next 12 months.
On balance, manufacturers continued to shed labour in the last quarter;
however most manufacturers expected to enlarge their payrolls in the coming
quarter. Most companies also had trouble recruiting qualified or trained
staff.
