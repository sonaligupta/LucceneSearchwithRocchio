FT  12 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Pentland poised to buy US consumer group


   By PEGGY HOLLINGER


PENTLAND, the sporting and consumer goods company which last year pulled out
of talks to purchase Adidas, is about to announce an acquisition in the US.
The target is believed to be a consumer goods group with sales of some
Dollars 100m (Pounds 70m), which will compliment Pentland's domestic
electrical appliance business in the US.
Speculation has centred on Pentland's intentions for its Pounds 347m cash
mountain - the legacy of its investment in Reebok - since plans to buy
Adidas, the sporting goods group, collapsed in acrimony last October.
However, the latest deal is not expected to reduce Pentland's cash
significantly.
The group, which announced an Pounds 156.4m drop in pre-tax profits for 1992
to Pounds 83.6m under new accounting standards, reported that the sale of
the 20 per cent stake in Adidas had resulted in a profit of Pounds 47.3m,
including currency gains.
The gain on disposals compared with Pounds 220.4m last time.
Mr Frank Farrant, finance director, said the group had returned an 85 per
cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 36.3m, after stripping out such
gains.
Sales were Pounds 10.7m higher at Pounds 326.5m.
The final dividend is raised 11 per cent to 1.46p for a total of 2.5p
(2.25p). Earnings fell from 62.28p to 15.79p, although excluding the
investment disposals they rose from 4.71p to 7.36p.
Net cash balances stood at Pounds 347.3m, against Pounds 272.7m last time.
Interest was also sharply higher at Pounds 26.1m (Pounds 6.3m).
Mr Farrant said the group had experienced a difficult year in its shoe
divisions.
Although the current year had begun encouragingly, Pentland was 'a bit
nervous' about the effects of a stronger dollar in the second half.
Speedo was the best performer, with a strong increase in sales worldwide.
Speedo in Europe and Australia had both been returned to profit.
Royalties from the international brand name had hit record levels.
