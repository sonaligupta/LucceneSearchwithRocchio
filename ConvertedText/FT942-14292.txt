FT  21 APR 94 / British film goes to top of US ratings


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


A low-budget British film that cost Dollars 5m (Pounds 3.4m) to make and was
shot in 36 days has gone to the number one slot in the US cinema box-office
ratings.
Four Weddings and a Funeral, a romantic comedy produced by Mr Tim Bevan and
Mr Eric Fellner, is the first British film to reach the top spot in the US
since A Fish Called Wanda in 1988.
The picture was wholly funded by Polygram and Channel 4 and is being
distributed by Gramercy, Polygram's distribution company in the US.
It opened at the beginning of last month on just five screens in New York,
but after favourable reviews it has grossed Dollars 14m across 721 screens.
Next week its coverage expands to 900 screens.
The film was made by Working Title Films, written by Richard Curtis and
opens in the UK on May 13. The cast includes Rowan Atkinson and Andie
MacDowell.
The film's success follows attention attracted by British films in the US
such as The Crying Game, Much Ado About Nothing and Shadowlands.
'It seems to me that something is definitely happening out there,' said Mr
Bevan.
