FT  23 APR 93 / UK Company News: Regent Inns set for market


   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE


REGENT INNS, which operates 38 public houses in London and the home
counties, yesterday announced plans for a full stock market listing.
It is raising Pounds 6.16m in a share placing and open offer, giving it a
market capitalisation of Pounds 19.8m.
Mr David Franks, managing director, will retain a 15.9 per cent stake in the
company, worth Pounds 3.15m at the issue price of 135p a share.
A chartered accountant, Mr Franks invested Pounds 20,000 in his first pub in
1977. When that was sold three years later he used the proceeds to acquire
Regent Inns, which then had six outlets. He expanded the company to 17 pubs
before merging it with Lockton Inns, a BES company in 1988.
The group, which has developed a diverse rather than themed estate, aims to
expand to about 80 outlets over the next five years.
It has increased pre-tax profits from Pounds 512,000 in 1990 to Pounds
974,000 last year and is forecasting not less than Pounds 1.31m for the
current year to July 3.
