FT  27 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Defence expert to head McDonnell Douglas


   By PATRICK HARVERSON


   NEW YORK


McDonnell Douglas, the US defence and aerospace group, yesterday announced
the appointment of Mr Harry Stonecipher, chairman of Sundstrand, the
Illinois-based aircraft and industrial products company, as its new
president and chief executive, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
Mr Stonecipher, 58, takes over from Mr John McDonnell, who will remain as
chairman. He joins McDonnell at a critical time for the company, which will
have to navigate choppy waters as the domestic defence industry reshapes
itself in the wake of a sharp contraction in US military spending. As part
of that restructuring, several of McDonnell's largest competitors have
joined forces recently in billion-dollar mergers, including Lockheed and
Martin Marrietta, Grumman and Northrop.
Among his more immediate tasks, Mr Stonecipher will have to persuade the
Pentagon and Congress not to reduce orders of the C-17 military transport
plane, and decide whether to sell McDonnell's missile business.
Investors and analysts appeared to welcome the appointment, with buyers
bidding up McDonnell's shares Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 113 3/4 on the New
York Stock Exchange.
