FT  24 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei loses early gains
as hopes for rate cut recede


   By EMIKO TERAZONO


   TOKYO


Early gains were lost as hopes of an imminent cut in the official discount
rate receded, and the Nikkei average closed only slightly ahead, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average was finally 54.51 up at 20,239.60, after having risen
to a day's high of 20,434.71 on foreign buying in the morning. It fell to
the day's low of 20,160.24 as stock index futures weakened in the afternoon.
Volume dropped to 280m shares from 550m, but advances still led declines by
672 to 323 at the close, with 162 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all
first section stocks gained a net 8.74 at 1,459.88. In London the ISE/Nikkei
50 index lost 2.23 at 1,135.35.
Shares rose in the morning on continued hopes of an imminent discount rate
cut, which had pushed the Nikkei above the psychologically important 20,000
level last Thursday. However, a rise in the overnight call rate, which is
controlled by the Bank of Japan's money market operations, discouraged
market participants.
Money supply growth figures for February, which fell to a record low of 1.6
per cent, also restrained investors. Traders said investors linked the weak
figures with continued slow economic growth and lower company earnings.
High-technology blue chips rose on bargain hunting by foreigners. Hitachi
added Y15 at Y774 and Toshiba Y2 at Y586. Also gaining ground were brokers,
Nomura rising Y60 to Y1,250 and Daiwa Y30 to Y800.
Car and related shares were weak on Japan's decision last week to cut its
voluntary ceiling on car exports to the US. Toyota Motor shed Y20 to Y1,360
and Nippondenso Y100 to Y1,350. Mitsubishi Motors fell Y92 to Y612 on heavy
selling amid rumours that Chrysler, of the US, would liquidate its
shareholding in Mitsubishi.
Small-capital component stocks of the Nikkei average, with low liquidity,
fell on index-related selling. Godo Shusei lost Y170 to Y1,640 and Daito
Woollen Spinning and Weaving Y140 to Y1,560.
A leading Japanese brokerage was seen selling Sankyo, down Y10 at Y2,470,
and Takeda Chemical, unchanged at Y1,070. This triggered declines in other
pharmaceutical issues.
In Osaka, the OSE average gained 145.01 at 21,696.08 in volume of 561.2m
shares. Small-lot buying by foreigners and individuals lifted the index,
while volume swelled on cross-trades by companies.
