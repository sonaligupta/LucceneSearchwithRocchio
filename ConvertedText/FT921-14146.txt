FT  17 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Technology Hldgs up 51% to Pounds 5.3m


Careful control of cash and overheads boosted pre-tax profits at Technology
Holdings by 51 per cent in the year to June 30 1991.
Profits for this computer distributor, systems supplier and computing
services company, were Pounds 5.3m (Pounds 3.5m) on sales ahead to Pounds
130.2m (Pounds 127.2m).
Privately held, the company was formed by a management buy-out from MBS, the
computer distributor, in February 1989. Retained profit for the year
totalled Pounds 7.08m (Pounds 3.52m) after taking into account an
extraordinary gain of Pounds 2.04m through the redemption of a vendor loan
note.
The final dividend is 2.5p for a total of 8.1p.
Mr Derek Lewis, chairman and managing director, said that comparatively flat
revenue growth hid a number of changes as the business was redefined.
High volume, low profit services were dropped in favour of products and
services offering higher margins.
Mr Lewis said distribution now comprised less than 20 per cent of turnover
and about 3 per cent of profit.
