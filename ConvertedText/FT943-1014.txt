FT  27 SEP 94 / Russian proposal for Caspian


   By JOHN LLOYD


   MOSCOW


Russia yesterday proposed a multinational co-ordinating committee to decide
on exploitation of oil and gas reserves in the Caspian Sea, after objections
from Russian ministers to the Dollars 8bn (Pounds 5bn) deal signed last week
between Azerbaijan and foreign oil companies to drill in the Azeri section
of the Caspian. Mr Yuri Shafrannik said that Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan,
two other former Soviet states bordering the Caspian, had already agreed to
establish the committee. Both Mr Alexander Shokhin, the Russian deputy prime
minister for the economy, and Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister, have
said the deal must not go ahead because of the ecological damage it would
cause to the Caspian sea - where the best caviar in the world is to be
found. Mr Shokhin has called for the resignation of Russian officials who
agreed to the deal.
