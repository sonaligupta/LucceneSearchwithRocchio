FT  17 JAN 92 / International Company News: Chevron restructure plan cuts
2,500 jobs


   By ALAN FRIEDMAN


CHEVRON, the fourth biggest US oil and gas company, is to cut its workforce
by 2,500 people, about 5 per cent, and record a Dollars 270m fourth-quarter
charge as part of a restructuring plan.
Mr Ken Derr, Chevron's chairman, said 500 of the 2,500 jobs being eliminated
related to the company's refinery in Port Arthur, Texas. The refinery
represents about 20 per cent of Chevron's total petroleum refining capacity
and its partial or full closure has been under review for some time.
Mr Derr said the company would focus on reducing operating costs. He added
that low natural gas prices, poor refining margins, the recession and
reduced demand for petroleum products had hampered Chevron's financial
results.
He said a final decision on Port Arthur would be made later this year. Among
the options is a complete shut down except for chemicals manufacturing -
this would cut about 1,600 jobs. At a minimum the refinery will cut capacity
by a third to 200,000 barrels a day.
The other 2,000 Chevron jobs will be eliminated by way of voluntary early
retirement, organisational changes and asset sales.
Mr Derr said that Dollars 185m of the Dollars 270m after-tax charges would
relate to Port Arthur. If the refinery were shut down Chevron would incur an
additional Dollars 200m charge.
Mr Derr announced plans to accelerate Chevron's programme to sell off more
of its non-strategic US oil and gas fields. He said new US environmental
regulations contained in the Clean Air Act would lead to costs of more than
Dollars 2bn over the next five years at Chevron's eight US refineries.
In the third quarter of 1991 Chevron's net profit fell by 22 per cent to
Dollars 313m.
Deliveries of petroleum products in the US - an important measure of demand
 -declined by 2 per cent in 1991, according to the American Petroleum
Institute (API). The industry association said oil's share of domestic US
energy consumption fell to less than 41 per cent in 1991, the lowest level
in 40 years.
