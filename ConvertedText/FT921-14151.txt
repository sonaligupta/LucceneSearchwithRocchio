FT  17 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Thos French doubles to Pounds 753,000


Thomas French & Sons, which makes decorative products for home furnishing
including Rufflette curtain tape, showed a measure of recovery in the year
to September 28 1991, doubling its pre-tax profit from Pounds 368,000 to
Pounds 753,000.
However, that was still somewhat short of previous years - Pounds 2m for
1988-89 and Pounds 1.5m in the preceding period.
Sales fell from Pounds 18.5m to Pounds 13.7m but trading profit improved
from Pounds 820,000 to Pounds 941,000. About 26 per cent of the sales ecline
was the result of withdrawing from some business areas, and 7 per cent was
attributable to continuing businesses.
But, said Mr Jeremy French, chairman, that potentially damaging reduction
was more than countered by cost-cutting measures, to the extent that sales
per employee increased 12 per cent and profit per employee almost trebled.
Interest costs were cut substantially to Pounds 188,000 (Pounds 452,000),
stemming from tight control of working capital and investment and the sale
of the surface heating business. Net borrowings were virtually nil at the
year-end, Mr French stated.
Earnings per share came to 4.41p (1.93p). The final dividend is again 2.175p
for an unchanged total of 3.625p.
