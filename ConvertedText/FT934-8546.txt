FT  15 NOV 93 / Observer: Back in business


One thing that Britain's parliamentarians really look forward to is an
official all-expenses-paid trip abroad. Imagine the horror then when members
of the Trade and Industry Select Committee were recently threatened with
having to fly economy class to south-east Asia because British Airways had
overbooked its flight.
However, all it took was the threat to call Sir Colin Marshall, BA's
chairman, and the MPs were reinstated in Business class although the
committee's two clerks were not so lucky. Hard to imagine a self-publicist
like Virgin Atlantic's Richard Branson making such a gaffe.
