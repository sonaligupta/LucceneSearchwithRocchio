FT  25 MAR 92 / Punch may face the chop next month


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


THE SURVIVAL of a unique remnant of the traditional British sense of humour
 -Punch magazine - depended last night on a last-minute infusion of American
money.
United Newspapers, publisher of the Daily Express and owner of Punch since
1963, decided yesterday that funding the magazine's losses of more than
Pounds 1m a year was no longer funny and set a closure date of April 8. The
brief stay of execution was designed to see whether anyone wanted to buy the
150-year-old magazine, which rejected all the submissions of Charles Dickens
but encouraged PG Wodehouse.
It was when Mr David Thomas, who is already perilously close to being the
last editor of Punch, was trying desperately to think of appropriately funny
last words from the block, that things became interesting.
'I feel like Fergie,' said Mr Thomas in a reference to the Duchess of York,
who last week announced her separation from the Duke of York. 'Everyone,
including us, criticised everything she did, but we'll all miss her when
she's gone.'
The almost unemployed humorist suddenly had an important message shoved
under his nose.
'An American publisher wants to buy Punch,' the message said.
The assets amount to considerably more than the title. They include Mr Punch
 -the magazine's symbol - a talented team of writers and cartoonists and a
circulation that last year averaged 33,000. The Punch library holds bound
volumes of every issue of the magazine and more than 2,000 original
drawings.
In addition to the American interest, two of the magazine's regular
columnists - Mr Richard Littlejohn and Mr Mitchel Symons - were last night
trying to raise venture capital to keep Punch alive and British, at least on
a monthly basis.
If Punch closed, the greatest losers would be cartoonists. 'It's a tragic
blow for cartoonists,' said Mr Mike Williams, a contributor for 25 years.
