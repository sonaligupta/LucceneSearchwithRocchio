FT  04 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Liffe plans to improve
availability of prices


   By TRACY CORRIGAN


THE London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (Liffe)
yesterday announced plans for revitalising the UK equity options market in
response to a survey of members.
Volume in the ailing market for individual UK stock options has improved
somewhat since Liffe merged with the London Traded Options Market earlier
this year. For example, volume in individual stock options reached 432,000
contracts in May, compared with 360,000 a year before. However, the market
is still felt to be far from achieving its potential.
The main problem identified by members was the poor availability of prices
in the stock options market, which was considered an even greater handicap
than lack of liquidity.
Consequently, Liffe plans to address the issue of price dissemination by
developing systems and procedures to distribute accurate and up-to-date
prices for equity options.
A pilot 'Autoquote' system is already in place for index options, and will
be extended to individual stock options. However, traders said the system
has experienced some teething problems, and the inclusion of many complex
series of stock options could be difficult.
The survey also identified demand for longer-dated options, both in index
and individual stock products. A study will be carried out to identify which
products are needed.
Other priorities include education and promotion among both retail and
institutional investors, and a fresh look at liquidity and trading
arrangements. A more detailed plan of action is now being prepared.
