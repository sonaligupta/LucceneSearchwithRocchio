FT  08 NOV 93 / When loss of job improves finances


   By DAVID GOODHART


MORE THAN one-fifth of redundant executives find their financial position is
improved by redundancy, says the latest annual survey of unemployed
executives by the Drake Beam Morin outplacement consultancy, David Goodhart
writes.
A total of 22 per cent of the 160 executives - most of whom are married men
 -say they expect redundancy to improve their financial position as a result
of severance payments. A worsening financial position is expected by 28 per
cent and 46 per cent say it was too early to comment on the effect.
Some 40 per cent of the redundant executives' partners are spending as
usual, but 5 per cent are spending more than usual.
There is a sharp increase in the number of executives who say they are ready
to relocate, from 31 per cent last year to 55 per cent this year. Nearly a
third are willing to relocate overseas.
