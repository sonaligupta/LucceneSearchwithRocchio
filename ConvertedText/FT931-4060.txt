FT  12 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Christies' auction sales rise to Pounds
636m


   By PEGGY HOLLINGER


CHRISTIES International, the auction house, yesterday bolstered rumours of a
revival in the world art market with its first rise in auction sales for two
years.
Mr Christopher Davidge, group chief executive, said signs of a return in
buyers' confidence were especially noticeable in the US. However, there had
been few major collections from estates available for auction in recent
months.
Mr David Tyler, finance director, said this meant the company was cautious
about the outlook for the first half.
However, the current year would benefit from the recent increase in the
buyers' premium charged in Christie's main locations.
In 1992 the value of auction sales increased by 9 per cent from Pounds 583m
to Pounds 636m. The most expensive item was Canaletto's The Old Horse
Guards, London, sold to Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber for Pounds 10.1m. Matisse's
Harmonie Jaune sold for a record Dollars 14.5m.( Pounds 10.2m)
Pre-tax profits rose 5 per cent to Pounds 6.7m (Pounds 6.36m), on turnover
of Pounds 109m (Pounds 103m).
Strong increases were recorded in jewellery, oriental art, furniture, books
and 19th and 20th century paintings. Some 69 lots sold for more than Dollars
1m, against 61 last time.
The pre-tax figure was struck after redundancy charges of Pounds 1.7m.
Earnings per share rose to 2.21p (2.12p). The final dividend is maintained
at 1p for a reduced total of 1.5p (3.3p).
