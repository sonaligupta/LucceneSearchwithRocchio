FT  22 OCT 94 / Fast track to France


   By HEATHER FARMBOROUGH


Bonjour, said the French Customs official, which came as a surprise as we
were still in Folkestone. But Le Shuttle is full of surprises, whether it is
Nicholas Grimshaw's breathtaking terminal or the sensation of driving your
car along a platform into a train, which then starts without you noticing.
Among a five-car compartment belonging to Eurotunnel shareholders who had
paid Pounds 30 for a return trip - 30 times more than their future
concessions are worth - was Elizabeth Hooninan, taking her second Le Shuttle
trip. Relieved that she had not found it claustrophobic, her only
disappointment was the lack of prestigious shops in the UK terminal.
'People have said to us we should sell our shares,' she said, 'but we
haven't and we won't. We feel that Britain needs a national project and we
bought the shares because we believed in the idea of a great British
venture.'
Jane and David Warren bought their shares in Eurotunnel because he hates
travelling by sea and she loathes flying. 'I'd definitely use it again -
especially as I hate the ferries in winter,' said David.
Seconds after leaving Le Shuttle, you are on the motorway heading towards
Paris, marvelling at the lack of formalities and the ease of the journey.
That is, until you realise you are driving on the wrong side of the road.
