FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Smiths expands in Europe


Smiths Industries, the aerospace and healthcare company, has expanded its
industrial group with two acquisitions in continental Europe.
The acquisitions - Sodiamex of France and Interplas, a Switzerland-based
company with operations in Italy, Spain and the UK - will be absorbed into
Smith's Flex-Tek ducting and conduit business.
Consideration for the purchases is Pounds 13.3m cash, with assumed
borrowings of about Pounds 5m.
Interplas, which specialises in suction and discharge hose for a range of
industrial activities as well as electrical conduit, is being acquired from
Walter Meier Holding, a Swiss public company. Sodiamex is a privately-owned
company specialising in ventilation ducting.
The total net assets of the two companies at the date of acquisition amount
to some Pounds 10m and operating profits for 1994 are estimated at Pounds
2.3m.
