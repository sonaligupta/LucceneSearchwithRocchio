FT  29 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: BP upgraded


   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY


Activity was strong in British Petroleum, with the interest, according to
several analysts, coming from UK insti-tutions eager to increase weightings
in the shares. This, combined with a stock shortage, lifted the shares 9 1/2
to 345 1/2 p on heavy volume of 12m.
US interest in the stock has been strong recently and many UK institutions
are underweighted in comparison with one estimate putting American holdings
of the shares at 27 per cent.
The shares were also boosted by an upbeat note from NatWest Securities,
which said that BP's recovery has further to run in spite of the weak oil
price. The broker upgraded its earnings forecast from Pounds 220m to Pounds
250m for third-quarter figures due next week.
Some of the activity in BP was at the expense of Shell Transport, which
receded 7 to 702p. Figures for Shell Oil US are due today.
The telecommunications interests of Pittencrieff took the stock to a record
high of 400p for a gain of 26.
The rumour mill continued to surround Lasmo yesterday, with the latest
stories suggesting that Mr John Walmsley, former finance chief of Enterprise
Oil, was in talks with a US consortium over a potential bid for Lasmo.
Attention continues to focus on Mr Walmsley after the resignation this week
of Lasmo's finance director. The shares closed unchanged at 142p after a
brief period at 143p.
Premier Consolidated Oilfields, which has had a run of large turnover,
enjoyed healthy activity again yesterday at 2.5m. The speculation of a
merger with Clyde Petroleum returned to the market, but Premier stayed at 26
1/2 p.
The expectation of good results from the merchant banks, which start
reporting next month, boosted the sector. SG Warburg advanced 23 to 913p,
while Mercury Asset Management rose 9 to 708p. Kleinwort Benson moved ahead
19 to 525p and Hambros gained 17 at 402p.
Among high street banks, TSB firmed 4 1/2 to 224 1/2 p on a view that the
recent strength of merchant bank stocks might help it secure a higher price
for Hill Samuel, its merchant banking subsidiary that the group is known to
want to sell.
National Westminster gave up 8 to 555p after Kleinwort Benson advised
investors to switch into Barclays. The latter improved 8 to 564p.
BZW launched a warrant on Kingfisher, the move helping the shares put on 9
to 659p. The warrant, which allows investors to buy the shares at the price
on the day of the warrant's purchase over a set period, cost 78.1p at
yesterday's prices.
The strike price of the underlying stock is 680p and the exercise period is
18 months. BZW is issuing 50m warrants on a one-for-one exercise basis with
the shares. The move coincided with the broker's research team reiterating
its positive stance on the stock.
Guinness, which was the subject of a NatWest warrant last week, continued to
improve. US house Lehman Brothers was said to be positive as the shares
moved 10 higher to 433p.
Ahead of meeting with analysts today, Rank Organisation shot forward 24 to
832p. Dealers said the stock had benefited from Xerox Corporation figures in
the US.
Third-quarter results from ICI found a positive response in the market and
the shares appreciated 13 to 718p in turnover of 4.3m.
However, some analysts still caution that the stock seems overvalued and
that the US support it has enjoyed cannot necessarily be relied on.
Shares in troubled defence electronics group Ferranti International fell 2
1/4 to 1 3/4 p after the company said it was recommending a penny a share
offer by GEC, as widely predicted by market watchers. Strong two-way
business once again brought high turnover of 56.7m, although that figure was
lower than Wednesday's total of 82m. Buyers of GEC were seen soon after the
announcement and the shares moved 7 ahead to 350p, as dealers talked of the
long term asset attractions of the deal.
A return to profits and an increase in the dividend provided the spur for
Manganese Bronze and the stock climbed 17 to 114p.
Another busy session for Cable and Wireless saw the shares advance 14 to
986p, an all-time high, ahead of today's scrip issue and results next week.
