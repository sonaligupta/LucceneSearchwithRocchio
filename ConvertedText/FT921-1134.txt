FT  25 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Prudential


The Pru's decision to stop writing general insurance via brokers is a rare
bit of cheerful news for UK composites. The move could yet look silly if the
cycle suddenly turned - but then sceptics said the same about Mr Newmarch's
humiliating exit from the estate agency game, and who is now to say that he
was wrong? Even in better times broker-related general insurance is too
small to make decent returns.
Like Legal and General, the Pru would no doubt be happy if its
transformation to a purer life and pensions business could be speeded up
even more. Last year's somewhat disappointing 9 per cent pre-tax profits
rise, for example, bore the mark of increased losses from the non-life side
of the reinsurance group, Mercantile and General. It is too early to be
alarmist, but one wonders just how long the sizeable prior year claims will
recur. The Pru is putting its substantial weight behind M and G for the
moment, but the company may yet provide Mr Newmarch with his next chance to
swing the axe.
