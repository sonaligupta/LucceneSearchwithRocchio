FT  16 DEC 94 / Matra awarded missile contract

The French Defence Ministry yesterday awarded Matra a FFr2bn (Pounds 230m)
contract to develop a long-range cruise missile, eventually giving France
the equivalent of the Tomahawk, which the US used against Baghdad in the
1991 Gulf war. Matra Defense-Espace, part of the Lagardere group, plans to
develop the subsonic 'stealth' cruise missile, with a range of 400-600km,
using some of the technology from its shorter-range Apache missile already
being producing with Deutsche Aerospace of Germany.
Matra, which is negotiating to merge its missile business with that of
British Aerospace, also hopes to interest the UK Ministry of Defence in a
derivative of the cruise missile. The UK has invited offers for its
programme for the Conventional Armament Stand Off Missile, an air-to-surface
missile with a range of nearly 400km, and Mr Noel Forgeard, head of Matra
Defense, said yesterday that his company would propose a scaled-down version
of the French cruise missile to the UK. The French cruise missile, which
could cost a total of FFr5bn-FFr10bn, was the only big new programme written
into the 1995-2000 military spending framework programme approved earlier
this year.
Matra beat Aerospatiale for the development, but the latter company will be
a subcontractor on the cruise missile's development and was yesterday
awarded another FFr2bn contract to develop a supersonic anti-ship missile.
