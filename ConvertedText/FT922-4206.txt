FT  06 JUN 92 / Books: Bitten by a midsummer collecting bug - Book fairs /
Preparing for a fairly exhausting time


   By WILLIAM ST CLAIR


EVERY YEAR the antiquarian and secondhand book trade holds a series of fairs
in London hotels. Although more than half the books sold go to the trade,
the public is also welcome. For the serious collector, mid-June is an
exhausting time. This year you can go from fair to fair nearly every day for
a fortnight with only a short break.
The fairs where the biggest selections of books are to be seen are those run
by the Provincial Booksellers Fairs Association. Originally set up to permit
booksellers outside London a link with wider trade, it has long outlived its
name. In the Edwardian splendour of the Hotel Russell in Russell Square,
Bloomsbury, 240 dealers this year will display 85,000 volumes. There is a
complete change of stock between the two fairs, but buying the catalogue for
the first will let you in to the second.
On two days, association members offer a roadshow where they give advice and
valuation. They accept no legal liability and are not permitted to make
offers, but this is a good opportunity to test whether you really do have an
unnoticed fortune on your shelves.
The books range in price from about Pounds 20 to the thousands. Other fairs
are more uniform in what you can expect. At the 'National' (which is named
after the venue, the Royal National Hotel in Bedford Way, not far from
Russell Square) the emphasis is on secondhand with only a few dealers in
older books. The same goes for the Bonnington, held in the hotel of that
name in Southampton Row off Russell Square, where you will see only a few
volumes old enough to have leather bindings. The 'International', at the
Cafe Royal at the foot of Regent Street, near Piccadilly, is more modest in
size than its name suggests, but you can expect to find some excellent high
quality books there at appropriate prices.
The most expensive books are to be found at the Antiquarian Booksellers
Association fair at the Park Lane hotel which, incidentally, is not in Park
Lane but at the Hyde Park Corner end of Piccadilly. This is an international
event where dealers from many countries offer magnificent illustrated books,
jewelled bindings, fine printing and illuminated manuscripts, as well as
printed books which are important for their words.
A copy of the first (1867) edition of 'Das Kapital' by Karl Marx still costs
Pounds 15,000 in spite of the collapse of all attempts to carry out its
ideas. A set of mimeographed scripts from the Goon shows of the 1950s is on
sale at Pounds 95 each.
The ABA fair is to be opened by satirist John Wells at 6pm during the
preview evening on Tuesday, June 25. The catalogue, which serves as entry
fee, is Pounds 15 that evening but is reduced to Pounds 5 the following
morning.
To celebrate the 150th anniversary of the London Library, about which John
Wells has written an amusing history, the fair has laid on a small
exhibition. One book not for sale is the copy of GH Lewes's Problem of Life
and Mind which a London Library member was reading in 1875 before going into
the Periodicals room and shooting himself.
