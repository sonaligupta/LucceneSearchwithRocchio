FT  17 JAN 92 / International Company News: Wesfarmers' Bunnings offer
'unacceptable'

WESFARMERS, the Western Australian farming and commodities group, is trying
to gain control of the Bunnings timber, hardware and metal products company
at 'an unacceptably low price', Mr Dolph Zink, Bunnings' chairman, said
yesterday.
Wesfarmers announced a ADollars 3.55 (USDollars 2.61) a share hostile bid
for Bunnings on January 1 following indications that BTR of the UK was
seeking to dispose of its 24.6 per cent stake.
BTR acquired the shares as a result of its recent Pounds 1.5bn (USDollars
2.68bn) takeover of Hawker Siddeley, the UK engineering group.
Wesfarmers says the ADollars 163m bid represents a fair price for Bunnings,
in which it has a 19.9 per cent holding.
However, Mr Zink said a committee of directors formed to consider the offer
believed the bid price was not related to the underlying value of Bunnings'
assets.
