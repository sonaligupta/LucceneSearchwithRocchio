FT  21 DEC 92 / Letter: Well served in Moscow


   From Mr MARK I WOLK


Sir, My wife and I were guests at the Aerostar Hotel in Moscow in March this
year. We were most impressed with the facilities and services and found them
to be a fine oasis from the rigours of very long and tiring days of
fact-finding.
There were a few rough spots, but not nearly enough to warrant the most
negative coverage you gave them in your article, 'Tempo changes at
heartbreak hotel' (December 7), which unfortunately would discourage others
from availing themselves of this good and reasonably priced hotel in the
troubled capital of Russia.
