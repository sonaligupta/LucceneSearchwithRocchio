FT  26 MAY 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report


   By REUTER


Precious metals trading followed a familiar pattern in London as the
commodity funds in New York weighed into the GOLD and SILVER markets pushing
prices sharply higher, dealers said. Gold was fixed in London at Dollars
377.50 a troy ounce in the afternoon, up on the morning setting of Dollars
374.35 which had followed lower overnight prices after a sell-off by the
funds on Monday. The Dollars 372 support level held well and once gold
failed to go through it, upside potential was there. On the LME TIN moved
off the lowest levels since the early 1970s, but still closed easier. The
market, depressed by fundamental oversupply and poor demand prospects, faces
further losses, dealers said. Three-month COPPER was encouraged by Monday's
bounce off Dollars 1,820 support, and gradually pushed higher to test
resistance above Dollars 1,850 a tonne by the close. ZINC rallied away from
Monday's six-year lows, mostly on covering and corrective buying, as there
is little joy in the fundamental picture. LEAD slipped back, as the rally
fostered by Monday's Metaleurop cut faded. ALUMINIUM was mildly supported by
news that Alcoa and Reynolds unions are to hold a strike vote.
