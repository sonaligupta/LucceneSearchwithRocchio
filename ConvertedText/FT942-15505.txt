FT  14 APR 94 / Seoul acts on exiled loggers from north


   By JOHN BURTON


   SEOUL


South Korea yesterday indicated that it might accept loggers escaping from
North Korean-managed lumber camps in Russia.
Seoul has so far refused to grant asylum to at least 120 workers who have
fled the logging camps because of fears that it could antagonise Pyongyang
and disrupt inter-Korean negotiations on North Korean nuclear inspections.
But the recent collapse of the nuclear talks has persuaded the government
'to review the issue based on the principle of humanitarianism,' said Mr
Choo Don-shik, the presidential spokesman.
The government is also responding to growing public pressure to accept the
loggers, who are considered South Korean citizens under its constitution.
The lumber camps, which employ 15,000 North Koreans, were established in
Siberia in the late 1960s, with North Korea providing labour in return for
receiving wood supplies valued at Dollars 100m. The camps are estimated to
provide Russia with Dollars 300m worth of lumber annually.
North Koreans who have fled the lumber camps speak of food shortages,
beatings, and death sentences for those trying to escape.
Russia has pressed North Korea to improve conditions at the camps and
threatened not to renew the logging contract, which expired at the end of
1993. The contract has been extended until June as Moscow continues
negotiations with Pyongyang.
Seoul will consider granting the loggers immediate asylum or ask Russia to
accept them as refugees, with a promise that they would be eventually
resettled in South Korea.
But North Korea has warned against any interference by Russia or South Korea
and said it would hold Seoul responsible for 'kidnapping' loggers found
missing from the camps.
But even if South Korea accepts the loggers, officials remain worried that
it could trigger a bigger exodus from the camps and possibly encourage
people living in North Korea to flee across the border to Russia and China.
'President Kim (Young-sam) fears that allowing the loggers into South Korea
may eventually lead to the sudden collapse of North Korea, just as the
exodus of East German tourists to Hungary and Austria in 1989 led to the
collapse of the East German government,' said one presidential aide.
China has only limited influence in persuading North Korea to accept nuclear
inspections, a senior Chinese official said yesterday.
'Many people believe that China can instruct North Korea to do this or that.
But that's not true,' said Mr Wu Xueqian, vice-chairman of the Chinese
political consultative conference.
