FT  29 JAN 92 / Consumers still gloomy over US economy


   By MICHAEL PROWSE


   WASHINGTON


US CONSUMER confidence slipped this month from already depressed levels in
December, indicating the economy remains in the grip of recessionary forces.
The Conference Board, a New York business consultancy, said its closely
followed index of confidence fell to 50.4, compared with 52.5 last month and
76.1 as recently as August.
The dip surprised many analysts who had forecast a marginal gain in
confidence. An index of business sentiment released this week had also
pointed to some improvement in confidence among manufacturers.
Consumer confidence is below the level registered during the Gulf war and
the deep 1981-82 recession.
Mr Fabian Linden, the board's director of consumer research, said the public
'remained uneasy about present conditions and uncertain about the future.'
Economic recovery could not occur without 'a marked improvement in
consumers' spirits and their willingness to spend.'
The board's survey of 5,000 households indicated that lack of confidence was
closely related to poor employment prospects. Nearly one in four of those
surveyed said someone in their household had experienced a jobless spell in
the previous 12 months.
Of those who had recently found new jobs, 45 per cent said they were earning
less money than in their previous position.
The survey indicated that 40 per cent of all households had deferred big
purchases in recent months because of fears over the economy.
The latest figures showed that consumers were gloomier about both current
conditions and future prospects than in the closing weeks of last year.
