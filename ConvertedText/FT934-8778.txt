   KUALA LUMPUR


THE Hong Leong group, one of south-east Asia's biggest conglomerates, has
extended its interests in banking and finance with the MDollars 1.1bn
(Dollars 423m) takeover of the banking and finance units of Malayan United
Industries (MUI).
MUI is selling its banking group for MDollars 695m cash to the Hong Leong
Credit company and its MUI finance unit to Bedford, another Hong Leong
company, for MDollars 405m in cash.
The Hong Leong group is controlled by Mr Quek Leng Chan, a Malaysian Chinese
and one of Malaysia's wealthiest businessmen.
Mr Quek, who is said to have strong connections with some of Malaysia's
senior politicians, had been trying to gain control of a local bank to
complement his manufacturing, property and financial interests.
