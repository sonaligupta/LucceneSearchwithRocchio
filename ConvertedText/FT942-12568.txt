FT  29 APR 94 / Paris shaves interest rates


   By JOHN RIDDING


   PARIS


The Bank of France yesterday took a further cautious step in its policy of
gradually lowering interest rates, shaving its intervention rate, the key
short-term official interest rate, by 10 basis points to 5.7 per cent. The
move was the second reduction within a week and reflects the central bank's
strategy of reducing borrowing costs in line with Germany. On Wednesday the
Bundesbank reduced its repo rate by 11 basis points to 5.47 per cent.
Yesterday's lowering of the French discount rate was the fifth this year.
All of the reductions have been 0.1 of a percentage point. The French
currency took yesterday's move in its stride, strengthening slightly to
trade at FFr3.429 to the D-Mark.
