FT  05 AUG 92 / Government Bonds: Italian bonds rally strongly after rate
cut

   LONDON, NEW YORK


ITALIAN government bonds rallied strongly in the wake of the Bank of Italy's
discount rate cut, continuing Monday's rise in the market.
The announcement on Monday evening of a half point cut in the official
discount rate - from 13.75 per cent to 13.25 per cent - took the financial
markets by surprise, and when the Italian government bond market opened
yesterday, bond prices surged half a point.
The Italian bond futures contract, which closed at 93.59 on Monday, reached
a high of 94.85 yesterday before profit-taking wiped out some of the gains.
By late afternoon the futures contract traded at 94.18.
Mr Franco Reviglio, the Italian budget minister, told Italian radio that
further interest rate cuts would be possible in the next few weeks if Italy
manages to restore its credibility in international eyes.
The Bank of Italy cut its official discount rate to 13.25 per cent following
the agreement at the weekend to abolish inflation-linked wage indexation.
Elsewhere in Europe, many of the bond markets are waiting for today's
opinion poll in France on the Maastricht Treaty. The most recent poll showed
57 per cent of French voters backing the ratification of the treaty, a
result which boosted French government bond prices by up to half a point on
Monday. Yesterday, French bonds ended the day slightly lower or little
changed, with the Matif futures contract slipping from 105.46 to 105.38 by
late afternoon.
UK government bonds fell on the combination of new supply in the sterling
bond market, speculation that a big US investor was selling gilts and
sterling weakness.
Volume in the Liffe futures contract was relatively high at 34,000
contracts. The contract fell from 97.11 to 96.29 while in the cash market
the 9 3/4 per cent gilt due 2002 dropped from 103 5/32 to 102 27/32 to yield
9.30 per cent.
GERMAN government bonds ended little changed in dull trading, with many
investors waiting on the sidelines for Thursday's Bundesbank Council
meeting.
The Liffe bund futures contract moved in a range of 86.78 to 87.06 and by
late afternoon it was trading at 86.96, slightly higher than Monday's close
of 86.93.
Dealers reported only faint interest in the German Bundespost 10-year bond
issue yesterday, when DM3bn of the 8 1/4 per cent bonds were priced at
100.30 to yield 8.2 per cent.
The federal bond consortium met yesterday to negotiate the terms, and
dealers expect a further DM2bn to be auctioned today. However, traders noted
only weak demand from domestic investors for 10-year issues.
US Treasury prices firmed yesterday as investors traded cautiously before
today's announcement of the government's quarterly refunding programme and
Friday's key jobs data.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  11/32 at 106
25/32 , yielding 7.422 per cent. The two-year note was up  3/16 at 99 29/32
, to carry a yield of 4.283 per cent.
The market expects the Treasury to unveil a Dollars 36bn refunding package
today, probably consisting of Dollars 15bn of three-year notes, Dollars 11bn
of 10-year notes and Dollars 10bn of 30-year bonds. With the wait for
refunding details and the eager anticipation of Friday's employment report
for July, many investors initially held their fire yesterday, although by
mid-afternoon activity, which had been limited mostly to technical
manoeuvring by professional traders and some sporadic speculative buying
early on, included active buying by retail interests.
The day's only economic data, the 0.2 per cent decline in the index of
economic indicators for June, was in line with expectations and had no
impact on a subdued market.
JAPANESE government bonds closed higher on the day, buoyed by firm domestic
demand.
The September futures contract moved in a relatively wide range - from
104.59 to 105.05 - and closed at 105.02 in Tokyo, against its opening level
of 104.64. In the cash market, the yield on the benchmark No 129 opened at
4.98 per cent and moved to 4.92 per cent in London trading.
