FT  27 SEP 94 / UK Company News: J Billam tumbles to Pounds 34,000


Shares in J Billam tumbled 10p to 134p yesterday after the Sheffield-based
engineer reported a decline in pre-tax profits from Pounds 271,000 to Pounds
34,000 for the first half of 1994. Turnover on continuing operations fell
from Pounds 3.46m to Pounds 3.08m.
Restructuring the ASME subsidiary led to reorganisation costs of Pounds
68,000 this time. However, Mr Stephen Ingram, chairman, said the benefits
should now begin to appear in trading results. He believed that the downturn
had now been arrested.
Earnings per share were 10p lower at 1.4p, but the interim dividend was held
at 2.2p.
