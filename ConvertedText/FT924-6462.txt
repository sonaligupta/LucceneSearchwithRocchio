FT  20 NOV 92 / Flexibility for audit firms wins backing


   By ANDREW JACK


NEARLY 90 per cent of business executives believe accountancy firms should
not be banned from providing non-audit services to companies they audit, and
85 per cent oppose enforced rotation of audit firms, a survey by accountancy
firm Coopers & Lybrand says.
Only 56 per cent believe firms should be permitted to conduct actuarial
services, 58 per brand valuations and 64 per cent executive search.
The survey - conducted as part of a wider market-research exercise by Gallup
for Coopers - questioned 151 finance directors, non-executive directors and
chief executives of FT 500 companies last July.
The majority said accountants should be able to provide a range of other
services to the clients, but many directors felt auditors did not have the
expertise and knowledge to offer general business advice.
Just 5 per cent said their auditors' objectivity had been compromised by
providing non-audit services, and only 7 per cent did not think auditors
demonstrated integrity.
But 28 per cent said the threat of reduced audit fees - which has been
driven by competition - is likely to undermine integrity.
Some 79 per cent said auditors did not set unrealistically low audit prices
to secure non-audit work, and only 23 per cent had used their audit firm for
management consultancy over the last two years.
