FT  13 APR 94 / International Company News: Forestry division lifts Intl
Paper


   By LAURIE MORSE

International Paper, the diversified US paper, packaging, and wood products
company, reported first-quarter earnings of Dollars 72m, or 58 cents a
share, up from Dollars 64m, or 52 cents, in the same period last year. Sales
were unchanged from the first quarter of 1993, at Dollars 3.4bn.
Most of the earnings improvement came from the company's forest products
division, where firm prices helped boost sales to Dollars 425m, from Dollars
400m a year ago.
However, the strength in the forestry area was offset by sales declines in
International Paper's biggest division, printing papers. Printing paper
sales fell to Dollars 955m in the quarter, from Dollars 1bn last year.
The company's packaging revenues were flat, while income from distribution
and specialty products improved. Mr John Georges, chairman, said that while
packaging volume improved, a decline in bleached board pricing more than
overshadowed the beneficial effects of higher containerboard prices.
'Printing papers volume and pricing were disappointing, although losses were
less than a year ago,' Mr Georges said. 'European and export markets began
to show signs of recovery, aided by higher pulp prices.' However, he said
the severe winter weather in much of the US had hit many of International
Paper's domestic businesses.
