FT  16 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Large MGN trade


   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON


Mirror Group Newspapers experienced exceptionally heavy turnover of 11m
shares as the market responded enthusiastically to the latest figures and
pushed the stock up 7 to 197p.
A lift in advertising revenues and trading margins, together with far better
than anticipated profits, saw forecasts raised to between Pounds 82m and
Pounds 85m for 1994. The only concern was the slide in circulation following
the price war started by News International.
The two English power generators, PowerGen and National Power, were among
the best performers in a generally strong utilities area following a strong
buy recommendation published by NatWest Securities.
The broker's strategic assessment of the two companies focused on the long
term attractions of both groups. Upgrading the stocks to a buy, NatWest
highlighted strong dividend growth, lack of regulatory threats and
recovering market share. PowerGen moved forward 13 to 552p and National
Power 12 1/2 to 463p.
North West Water, up 20 to 546p, Severn Trent, 15 better at 579p, and Wessex
Water, 15 higher at 671p, were the pick of the water stocks.
The placing of a block of 5.9m Vodafone shares at a discounted 564p by house
broker UBS, to finance the acquisition of a one-third stake in General
Mobile Communications from Generale des Eaux, of France, saw Vodafone dip 4
to 571p.
Saatchi & Saatchi slipped a penny to 141p in spite of returning to
profitability. The market was disappointed by the group's margin growth. SG
Warburg reduced its 1994 profits forecast by 10 per cent to Pounds 30m.
An initial advance in electrical group Delta after the group revealed a
higher than expected dividend increase proved shortlived after brokers
downgraded current-year profits estimates.
Analysts were particularly concerned by the continuing pressure on profits
in the cable industry. The shares gave up 7 at 522p.
The list of brokers downgrading included Strauss Turnbull, which trimmed its
estimate by Pounds 4m to Pounds 59m. Several brokers advised investors to
switch out of Delta and into BICC, which appreciated 9 to 440p.
UK airports operator BAA closed 13 ahead at 1001p after a positive note on
the stock from NatWest Securities. The securities house, which expects 1994
profits of Pounds 324m, said: 'The company continues to produce traffic
growth marginally ahead of our expectations, giving us confidence in our
full-year profits forecasts.'
Analysts returned positive from pre-close season meetings with Granada,
helping the shares climb 6 to 561p amid profits forecast upgrades.
Euro Disney shares opened sharply down following the weakness seen after the
theme park group announced a financial rescue package on Monday. They later
rallied, ending the day 5 ahead at 395p.
Reports of a further round of price cuts in the milk market hurt Unigate and
Northern Foods, the shares slipping 3 to 348p and 2 to 218p respectively.
Tesco, off a penny at 223p, was said to be applying the renewed pressure on
suppliers, with expectations that other big operators Argyll, 3 ahead at
254p, and J. Sainsbury, 10 forward at 386p, are likely to follow suit. The
news follows weekend reports that Asda, up a penny at 60 1/2 p, was
pressuring suppliers to turn price promotions into permanent price
reductions.
