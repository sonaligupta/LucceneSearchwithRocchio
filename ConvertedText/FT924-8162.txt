FT  12 NOV 92 / Actors' union to sue BBC


EQUITY, the actors' union, is to take the BBC to court over the sale of its
programmes to UK Gold, the entertainment channel launched on satellite at
the beginning of this month.
Equity announced it was ending its agreement with the BBC covering payments
for programmes sold to satellite channels and overseas broadcasters before
UK Gold was launched.
UK Gold, whose founding shareholders include the BBC and Thames Television,
is based entirely on library programmes such as Miss Marple and Bergerac
from the BBC and Minder from Thames.
Equity claims its agreement with the BBC does not cover UK Gold and that the
sales are in breach of copyright legislation.
