FT  08 NOV 93 / Sunday workers' rights undecided


MINISTERS yesterday scotched speculation that the government had decided to
include a right not to work on Sundays in its plans for Sunday shopping
legislation.
The government plans to introduce a bill legalising Sunday shopping in the
Queen's Speech later this month. Ministers yesterday said that they had not
yet decided whether to include guarantees of shop workers' rights.
An official said: 'It is not strictly true that the government has changed
its mind on this. The government is still looking at the whole bill and
taking views from all the interested parties.'
A week-long campaign to enlist public support for the partial deregulation
of Sunday shopping, coupled with statutory protection of workers' rights, is
to be launched today by the GMBU general union in the north of England.
