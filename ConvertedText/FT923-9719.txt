FT  04 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Sri Lanka sees boom in tourism

THE year 1992 is likely to be a boom one for Sri Lankan tourism, the
country's tourist board said yesterday, Mervyn de Silva reports from
Colombo. 'We are likely to pass the half-million mark,' an official
predicted. The previous record was 402,000 in 1982. Anti-Tamil riots in 1983
cut the total to 200,000, but political stability was the main reason for
the improvement.
Europe continues to top the list, with Germany ranking first, and Italy,
France and the Netherlands showing a sharp rise in numbers. The board
believes the half-million mark can be reached if Air Lanka expands its
European service. But the carrier's plan to buy six Lockheed TriStars has
been criticised by the World Bank and IMF.
