FT  30 JUN 93 / Germans to ease law on waste burning

GERMANY intends to introduce legislation to allow both domestic and
industrial waste to be incinerated when recycling proves too costly,
according to Mr Thomas Rummler, a director responsible for waste disposal at
the federal environment ministry.
The move would represent a shift in Germany's tough environmental policies,
which place severe restrictions on incineration.
'Recycling will continue to be given priority but incineration will be
permitted when recycling does not make sense economically or when it is more
expensive,' Mr Rummler said at a conference on waste management jointly
organised by The Financial Times and the Boston Consulting Group.
Germany's environmental policies have recently been under renewed attack
from industrial lobbies, including the German federation of industry. They
are complaining that German waste disposal laws place an unfair burden on
businesses struggling against recession and intense foreign competition.
Germany has some of the strictest environmental laws in Europe. It also has
a draft bill which plans to force manufacturers to take back durable
consumer goods like electronic and white goods and recycle the materials.
Industrialists at the conference raised questions on the validity of the
German approach to 'recycle at all costs'.
Computer manufacturers, for example, argue that energy recovery, such as
burning plastics and using the resulting heat for cement kilns, is a viable
alternative to recycling. France, Denmark and Belgium are currently using
such incineration methods.
Mr Rummler said the new legislation would foresee the construction of
incineration plants. Such projects have until now been highly controversial
in Germany and new moves to establish incinerators are likely to be fiercely
resisted by communities and environmental groups.
