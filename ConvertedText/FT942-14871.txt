FT  19 APR 94 / Factory gate price rises slow to 2.7%


   By GRAHAM BOWLEY and PHILIP COGGAN


Inflationary pressures remain subdued in the UK, while consumer confidence
has been hit by this month's tax rises, according to reports published
yesterday.
The news appeared to strengthen the domestic case for a cut in interest
rates, but the authorities might be restricted by the Federal Reserve's move
yesterday to raise US rates.
Producer output prices - the price of goods leaving factories - rose by 2.7
per cent in the year to March, the lowest annual increase since September
1992, according to the Central Statistical Office.
Producer input prices - the cost of raw materials and fuels - fell by 2.6
per cent in the year to March, compared with a fall of 2.9 per cent in
February.
Figures for producer prices are seen as a leading indicator for trends in
the retail prices index. Last week, the CSO reported that the annual rate of
underlying inflation had fallen to 2.4 per cent in March.
Meanwhile, the latest Gallup survey of consumer confidence, conducted for
the European Commission, showed UK consumers more pessimistic than at any
time since March 1990. The Gallup survey is watched closely by the
government and is regularly commented on by the Treasury.
The Gallup survey has shown a steady decline in confidence this year. The
balance of those expecting a decline in their financial position over the
next 12 months, as against those expecting an improvement, was 30 percentage
points in April, compared with 25 points in March.
Minutes of monthly monetary meetings, published last week, showed that Mr
Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of
England, appeared to agree on March 2 that a further cut in base rates might
be justified if signs of economic weakness were accompanied by evidence that
inflation was under control.
