FT  09 JUN 92 / Lira faces renewed pressure


   By ROBERT GRAHAM


   ROME


THE Italian lira came under renewed pressure yesterday as the business and
financial community took stock of the impact of last week's Danish
referendum rejecting the Maastricht treaty.
At the same time, leading commercial banks raised their prime rate by half a
point to 13.5 per cent in response to last week's raising of rates by the
Bank of Italy.
In thin trading the lire was quoted at 756.4 against the D-Mark. This was
right against the Bank of Italy's unofficial floor for the currency. The
lira has hovered at this level since last Thursday when the markets first
reacted to the Danish referendum result. But yesterday the Bank of Italy did
not intervene by selling D-Marks as it did on Thursday and Friday last week.
'The situation surrounding the lira is complex and the markets continue to
be nervous,' Mr Rony Hamaui, head of research at Banca Commerciale Italiana
(Comit), said.
Last Thursday the Bank of Italy raised rates on short-term advances by half
a point to 13 per cent to protect the lira but refrained from a more
definitive move by increasing the discount rate. Yesterday, the Bank of
Italy also sought to squeeze liquidity by raising rates on repurchase
agreements with the banks. The rate being offered was 13.13 per cent, more
than 0.6 per cent above that of last Wednesday.
The commercial banks have felt obliged to raise their prime rates in
response. 'I don't know if the half point on the advances (by the Bank of
Italy) will be sufficient,' Mr Hamaui said. 'The Bank of Italy intervened
quickly and sought to anticipate things which could get worse.'
The main concern centred on whether the politicians' resolve to tackle
Italy's deteriorating public finances would be weakened by the Maastricht
crisis.
