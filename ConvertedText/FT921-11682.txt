FT  30 JAN 92 / Computer security breaches cost Pounds 1.1bn


   By ALAN CANE


BREACHES OF computer security cost business at least Pounds 1.1bn per year,
according to a survey published yesterday.
More than half the 900 companies surveyed said they had suffered a
significant security breach, either through accident or malice, in the past
five years.
The most serious incident reported involved a fire and flood in a finance
company that destroyed all its computers. The immediate cost was Pounds 8m
and the long-term total Pounds 24m.
The survey was conducted by the National Computing Centre with support from
ICL, the computer manufacturer, the Department of Trade and Industry and
Elsevier Publications, the Dutch publishing group.
Companies are still reluctant to inform the police about losses. The average
cost to a company of a hacking incident was Pounds 23,000; the largest
reported cost recorded in the survey from hacking was Pounds 50,000.
