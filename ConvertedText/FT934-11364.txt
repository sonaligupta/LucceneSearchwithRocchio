BEVERLEY Group, the engineer, lapsed into the red in the six months to June
30 with pre-tax losses of Pounds 929,000, against profits of Pounds 56,000.
The loss reflected a fall in turnover to Pounds 6.46m, down from Pounds
9.68m.

In an attempt to cut back on its debt, the Bristol-based group is selling

Industries, a subsidiary of VSEL, for Pounds 3.5m.
The company said cash from the sale would be boosted by a Pounds 2.5
dividend from Gall Thomson's accumulated reserves.
