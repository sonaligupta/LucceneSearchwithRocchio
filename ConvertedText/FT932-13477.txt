   MOSCOW


SIMKO, the Turkish tele-communications company, has signed a Dollars 100m
(Pounds 66.2m) deal to build three telephone exchanges in Turkmenistan,
Interfax news agency said, Reuter reports from Moscow.
The central Asian republic, the world's third largest gas producer, with
output totalling 84bn cubic metres a year, will fund the deal with natural
gas exports.
Several Turkish companies have signed deals for telecom systems in former
Soviet republics.
Officials from Turkey's state-run post and telecommunications company PTT,
which donated a 2,500-line telephone switchboard to Turkmenistan last year,
say only 6 per cent of the republic's 3.6m people own telephones.
