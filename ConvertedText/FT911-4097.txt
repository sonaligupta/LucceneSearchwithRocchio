FT  20 APR 91 / Finance & The Family: Your free guide to investment


The recession persists, yet the climate for long-term investment is
improving . . . The apparent paradox is explained in the spring issue of the
FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance, published free with both next
Friday's and next Saturday's Financial Times.
Investment for income, home insurance and a survey on investment trusts are
among the features in the third issue of the Review, which analyses the past
quarter and presents valuable statistics in a form not readily available to
the small investor.
