FT  20 NOV 92 / People: UK gathers AT&T's regional experience


James Mellon has been appointed managing director of AT&T's international
operations division in the UK.
He will have two main responsibilities: managing the US telecommunications
giant's correspondent relationships with British Telecommunications and
Mercury Communications, which govern more than Dollars 1bn of international
traffic between the two countries; and developing the services AT&T offers
its customers.
Mellon says he is the first AT&T manager to work in all the world's three
big regions. In his last job, he looked after AT&T's correspondent
relationships in South America and Africa, working out of Florida. Before
that, he spent nearly four years in Hong Kong managing relationships with
China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao.
His new post is a 'rounding job', he says, which would give him an
understanding of the world's post, telephone and telegraph companies (PTTs).
Aged 45, he has been with the AT&T group for 19 years, starting his career
at New England Telephone, which is now split off from AT&T.
Although Mellon says his main goal would be to build on the existing
relationships 'which are very profitable to both sides', he would not rule
out satisfying customers' needs by competing with BT if that proved
necessary.
In recent years, AT&T has examined the possibility of acquiring stakes in
GPT, the UK telecommunications manufacturer, and Mercury, but in both cases
negotiations broke down. There has also been speculation that it was
interested in buying the Vodafone Group, the mobile communications concern.
However, Mellon says it would be 'speculative' to comment on the possibility
of making any moves of a similar nature, but he confirms that such
acquisitions would come within his responsibility.
