FT  12 APR 94 / Observer: Dutch treat


Risky place, the Netherlands. Apparently the country's 50 or so McDonald's
restaurants are at least twice as likely to suffer property damage and loss
of profits through fire, flood, vandalism and theft as their counterparts in
eight other Asian and European countries.
'There does not appear to be any single explanation,' says Mark Scully, a
consultant with the actuarial firm Tillinghast, which carried out the survey
for McDonald's. So if you fancy a Big Mac in The Hague, is the advice to
think twice about it?
