FT  05 JUN 92 / Letter: Maastricht, A 'Perot factor' strikes a chord in
Europe (2)


   From Mr CHRISTOPHER LOWE


Sir, I observed with interest both the run-up to the Danish referendum and
the reaction to the result, with the final vote being 50.7 per cent against
ratification of Maastricht.
Notwithstanding the exit polls, which indicated a last-minute swing to a yes
vote, the result did not come as a major surprise to me, as during the short
period before the referendum the reaction to the Vote Yes campaign was
either indifference at best and in some cases open hostility.
Scaremongering was used by both camps, with forecasts of large job losses
predicted by Uffe Ellemann-Jansen, the foreign minister, if the vote was no,
and an invasion of Danish summer houses by other nationals (in particular
Germans) if the vote was yes. The details of Maastricht were on the whole
left out of the arguments, and in the end the vote appears to have been made
on the basis of gut reaction by the Danish people.
Last weekend at my local cinema, the advertisement for the yes vote was
greeted with loud derision. It showed a young couple holding hands, the boy
having the Union Jack on his backpack and the girl with the Danish flag. It
may come as no surprise that the film was 'Basic Instinct'.
