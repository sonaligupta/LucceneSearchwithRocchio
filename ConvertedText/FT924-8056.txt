FT  13 NOV 92 / China criticises HK politicians


   By SIMON HOLBERTON


   HONG HONG


China yesterday hit out at Hong Kong's local politicians for supporting
proposals made by Mr Chris Patten, the colony's governor, for more democracy
 -but won little favour for itself in the process, writes Simon Holberton in
Hong Hong.
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing's unofficial embassy in Hong Kong, said the
Legislative Council (LegCo) had no right to approve a resolution which ran
counter to agreements and understandings reached between China and Britain.
LegCo was only a 'consultative body', it said.
On Wednesday night, legislators voted 32 to 21 in favour of a motion
supporting Mr Patten's proposals for more democracy in elections due in
1995. They also called on Britain and China to resume talks.
