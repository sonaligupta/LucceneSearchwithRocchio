FT  26 MAY 93 / People: Cleaver brings green concerns to nuclear agency


Sir Anthony Cleaver, part-time chairman of IBM UK, will take on the
chairmanship of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) from July
on the retirement of John Maltby, the former chairman of Burmah Oil, who has
served his three-year term.
The UKAEA, which trades as AEA Technology, is a candidate for privatisation.
The DTI has already asked merchant bank BZW to examine the feasibility of a
transfer into the private sector - which would not happen before 1995.
The agency's orientation is considerably more commercial than when
mechanical engineer Maltby arrived describing himself as a 'dirty-handed
businessman whose job is to make money'. For the year ended March 1992, it
announced a profit of Pounds 16.8m, following a Pounds 40m loss for the
previous 12 months.
Sir Anthony, who joined IBM UK in 1962 after taking a classics degree from
Oxford, was chief executive from 1986 to 1991 and has been chairman since
1990.
Much of AEA's energy is devoted to helping companies adopt and exploit
innovative technologies - often transferring technologies developed
specifically for the nuclear industry to other kinds of business. Observers
comment that Cleaver's experience at IBM, where there has been a shift from
straight selling to customer service and joint problem-solving, should be an
asset.
Cleaver's prominent advocacy of green business practices should also boost
AEA's efforts to develop environmental expertise which includes a programme
to advise governments on renewable energy sources.
In view of restricted government funds for nuclear research and development,
AEA aims to increase the non-nuclear side of its business - presently at
about 35 per cent of turnover - to about 50 per cent by the mid-1990s.
