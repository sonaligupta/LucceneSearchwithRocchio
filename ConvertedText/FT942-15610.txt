FT  14 APR 94 / OFT investigates supply of Japanese electrical goods


   By PEGGY HOLLINGER


The Office of Fair Trading is investigating the trading practices of at
least six Japanese electrical goods manufacturers following complaints that
they are refusing to supply discount warehouse clubs.
Complaints have been received from Nurdin & Peacock, the cash and carry
retailer which opened a warehouse club last month, and CostCo of the US.
CostCo last year launched the concept in Britain of a discount shopping club
which charges membership fees. The US company complained to the OFT in
December that electrical goods manufacturers refused to supply products.
Only N&P, however, has specified the manufacturers it alleges are proving
obstructive. These are Aiwa, JVC, Panasonic, Sanyo, Sony and Toshiba.
'Refusal to supply is something we take a very serious view on,' the OFT
said. 'If a retailer cannot get a certain product, the market is not working
competitively and prices might be artificially high.'
N&P has claimed it is forced to buy electrical goods such as televisions
from the so-called 'grey market' - distributors who supply independent
retailers. This means it has to pay 3-5 per cent more for its products, says
Mr David Poole, chief executive.
Mr Poole criticised the manufacturers while announcing N&P's annual results,
implying they sought to keep prices high. If warehouse clubs sold such goods
at the normal discounts, 'prices would come down in all the other shops,' he
said. N&P claims it sells brand-name televisions for up Pounds 150 less than
high street outlets.
Sony yesterday denied that it had refused to supply N&P's warehouse clubs.
'We are currently in the middle of discussion with them,' the company said.
'We have an open mind and have not said no.'
Mr Poole said US warehouse clubs were believed to have experienced similar
difficulties.
