FT  20 APR 94 / International Company News: Volvo set to issue strategy
statement

Volvo will today make an important statement on its future strategy,
including details of further disposals, following the collapse of plans to
merge with Renault last year.
Mr Soren Gyll, group chief executive, is expected to emphasise at a meeting
with shareholders that many of the group's activities not directly linked to
car and truck manufacturing are to be sold.
His speech at the group's annual general meeting in Gothenburg is also
likely to make it clear that the group is not seeking a Renault-type
alliance with other vehicle manufacturers.
The strategy represents a break with the era of Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, who
resigned as Volvo chairman in December after the plan to merge with Renault
broke down.
Volvo has already sold a number of non-core businesses this year. These
include a 25 per cent stake in Custos, an investment group, for SKr1.74bn
(Dollars 219m), and a 4.6 per cent holding in Norway's Saga Petroleum for
NKr458m (Dollars 62m). Last week the company sold a 26 per cent holding in
the Hertz car rental group to Ford for Dollars 145m.
The group retains a large number of other operations outside its main
businesses. They include a 100 per cent stake in Alfred Berg, the
stockbroker, 25 per cent of the real estate group, Pleiad, and 22 per cent
of the investment company, Cardo.
One of the main points of focus will be the company's involvement in BCP, a
consumer products company where it has 74 per cent of the shares, and
Pharmacia, the pharmaceuticals group in which it holds 25 per cent. It
inherited the stakes after the Procordia group - jointly controlled by Volvo
and the state - was broken up last year.
The group committed itself to bidding for the outstanding shares in BCP last
October before the collapse of the Renault deal.
