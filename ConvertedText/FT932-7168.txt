FT  25 MAY 93 / International Company News: Tokio Marine and Fire receipts
increase - Japanese Corporate News and Results Round-up


   By ROBERT THOMSON


TOKIO Marine and Fire Insurance, the largest Japanese non-life company,
reported 5.6 per cent growth in premium receipts in the year ending in
March, as the industry generally benefited from a higher rate card during
the period.
Pre-tax profit at Tokio Marine was down 1.4 per cent to Y83.7bn (Dollars
758m), but the non-life companies have fared better than many Japanese
financial institutions, hard hit by the collapse of stock and property
prices over the past three years.
Loss ratios for Tokio Marine were highest in the marine area at 83.6 per
cent, and lowest on fire-related business at 39.5 per cent, down from 92.5
per cent in the previous year. Loss claims on car-related policies,
accounting for just under half of the total, were running at 63.1 per cent,
unchanged from the previous year.
Tokio Marine said unrealised gains on securities holdings were Y1,931bn at
end-March, compared to Y1,955bn a year earlier, though gains on foreign
securities holdings fell from Y3.3bn to Y428m.
For the current year, the company expects premiums to expand to Y1,230bn,
reflecting the impact of a 10.6 per cent rise in premium charges in April,
following a 7.4 per cent increase in mid-1991. Pre-tax profit is forecast at
Y91bn, a gain of 8.7 per cent.
Mitsui Marine and Fire Insurance reported 4.2 per cent growth in premiums,
and a 36.6 per cent lift in pre-tax profit to Y28.4bn. It reported a similar
loss ratio to Tokio, 64.4 per cent, on car-related policies, 77 per cent in
the marine area, and 37.8 per cent on fire, down from 65.3 per cent.
This year, Mitsui Marine is expecting that premiums will rise from Y548.6bn
to Y600bn, and forecasts a pre-tax profit marginally higher at Y29bn.
Yasuda Fire and Marine Insurance reported 4.6 per cent growth in premiums,
but a 7.2 per cent fall in pre-tax profit to Y37bn. However, the company
expects premium growth of almost 10 per cent to Y880bn this year, and a
pre-tax profit of Y38bn.
Pre-tax profits were flat at Sumitomo Marine and Fire Insurance, 5 per cent
higher at Nichido Fire and Marine Insurance, and 22 per cent lower at
Dai-Tokyo Fire and Marine Insurance.
