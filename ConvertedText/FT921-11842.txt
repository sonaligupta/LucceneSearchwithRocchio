FT  30 JAN 92 / Trade unionists demonstrate outside Hong Kong's legislature


   By REUTER


   HONG KONG


HUNDREDS of trade unionists demonstrated outside Hong Kong's legislature
yesterday, demanding that the government drop plans to import workers to
ease the British colony's labour shortage, Reuter reports from Hong Kong.
Chan Yuen-Han, a member of the Federation of Trade Unions' standing
committee, said many of the 500,000 workers represented by the demonstrators
would strike if the government did not give in. He said unions would set up
a strike fund and organise another rally after the Chinese New Year.
The government, under pressure from employers to ease the labour shortage
they say is feeding the colony's double-digit inflation, last month raised
the ceiling on workers to 25,000. Many of the existing 13,000 come from
across the Chinese border.
About 600 unionists waved banners, shouted slogans and cheered speeches by
unionists outside the Legislative Council (Legco) building. Legislators
inside were due to debate a motion calling for a review of the two-year-old
policy.
Unions oppose the scheme saying it would lower wages and put many people out
of work.
