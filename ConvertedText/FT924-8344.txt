FT  11 NOV 92 / International Company News: Skandia scales down reinsurance
operations in US

SWEDISH insurer Skandia has begun scaling down its North American
reinsurance operations, after rejecting a Dollars 550m offer for the
business from the US investment group John Head & Partners.
Skandia said it intended to cut annual net premiums at Skandia America Corp,
its North American non-life reinsurance unit, to Dollars 100m a year from
the current Dollars 450m over the next two years.
SAC, currently the eighth largest reinsurer in the US, has already announced
plans to sell its surety portfolio to Nac Re, another US reinsurer.
Skandia said it had decided to break off talks with John Head because of
disagreements over pricing and uncertainties as to whether the deal could be
completed.
It said the structure of the transaction would have given it a continuing
exposure to reinsurance through the retention of preferred stock.
SAC, which has an equity of Dollars 400m, is expected to focus primarily on
casualty busi-ness.
US credit rating agency Standard & Poor's yesterday downgraded the senior
debt, claims-paying ability, and commercial paper of a number of companies
within the Skandia group.
The move 'reflects continued upheaval in Scandinavian financial markets, an
expected further decline in asset values, and the company's inability to
significantly restructure its debt maturity schedule,' said S&P.
Skandia International Insurance Corp, Skandia American Reinsurance Corp and
American Skandia Life Assurance Corp have had their claims-paying ability
downgraded to 'BBB' from 'A'.
Skandia Capital AB's senior debt was lowered to 'BBB' from 'A' and the
commercial paper ratings on Skandia Capital AB and Skandia International
Capital Corp to 'A-3' from 'A-2'.
