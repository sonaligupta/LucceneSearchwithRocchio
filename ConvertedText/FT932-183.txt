FT  30 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: MPs to lobby on African debt


AN all-party group of MPs was launched yesterday to campaign for agreement
among the Group of Seven industrialised nations on new measures to help
reduce African debt.
It is calling for the Tokyo G7 summit to approve a significant write-off of
Africa's debt as a first step in a longer-term debt relief package.
The group is led by Mr David Howell, Tory chairman of the foreign affairs
committee; Mr Michael Meacher, shadow overseas development minister, and Sir
David Steel, Liberal Democrat foreign spokesman.
