FT  04 AUG 92 / Satellite project by ITV seen as 'spoiler'


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


DOUBTS have been cast on how serious the ITV companies are about launching a
satellite television service, Raymond Snoddy writes.
Memos of a meeting attended by the main potential backers of the venture
said it 'could not in any circumstances become a money spinner'.
The project appears designed more as a spoiler of UK Gold, the Thames-BBC
venture which plans to launch in the autumn based on the broadcasters'
programme archives.
At the end of last month senior ITV executives said there was serious
interest in at least one channel using ITV library programmes.
The ITV 2 venture, it was estimated, would cost between Pounds 25m and
Pounds 30m and would be broadcast on the Astra satellite system.
The ITV competition committee decided: 'The main point (of ITV2) would be
the possible impact on Thames/BBC plans and the siphoning of advertising
revenue from other satellite channels.'
