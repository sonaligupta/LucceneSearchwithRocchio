FT  22 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow at record despite worries
over Fed policy

Wall Street
A LATE afternoon rally lifted the Dow Jones Industrial Average to a record
level yest-erday, but market sentiment remained negative as uneasiness about
the Federal Reserve's monetary policy pushed market interest rates higher,
writes Karen Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 10.62 higher at 3,555.40 after
showing a loss for most of the day. However, declines on the big board still
led rises by 1,051 to 901, underscoring the market's bearish tendencies, and
the Standard & Poor's 500 was off 0.13 at 447.18. The Nasdaq composite
slipped 1.82 to 700.08. NYSE volume was 278.6m shares.
Losses were more severe in the bond market, where the benchmark 30-year bond
fell  7/8 to 106 15/16 , yielding 6.621 per cent. Bonds have fallen steadily
since Tuesday, when Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, told
congress that US inflation was disappointing. His remarks sparked fears that
the Fed might tighten monetary policy.
Compaq Computer climbed Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 49 in very heavy trading
following the release of second-quarter earnings which met analysts'
forecasts. Compaq's ability to meet investor expectations was in contrast to
the performance of many other computer companies this quarter, most notably
Apple Computer, which disappointed investors last week with weak
third-quarter earnings.
In Nasdaq trading Apple's share price continued to erode after a one-day
hiatus on Tuesday. The stock was quoted Dollars  5/8 lower at Dollars 26 1/4
. Also in the technology sector, Intel shed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 51 1/8
after a court ruled against the company in copyright litigation with
Advanced Micro Devices, Dollars  1/8 up at Dollars 24 3/4 .
UAL, parent of United Airlines, rose Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 138 3/8 after
the carrier's three biggest unions announced terms of their offer to
management. The unions, which last week said they would offer significant
cost reductions in exchange for a large stake in the airline, said they
would grant Dollars 3.6bn in labour concessions in return for a 60 per cent
stake.
Second-quarter results contributed to share price gains elsewhere in the
sector. USAir firmed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 16 1/8 , although the company
said its results for the quarter trailed earlier expectations, reflecting
sluggish economic conditions. USAir posted operating income of Dollars
66.2m, against the previous operating loss of Dollars 67.9m.
The escalation of the tobacco industry price war hit the sector. RJ Reynolds
regained its morning loss to close unchanged after saying it would
consolidate three price levels into two in response to competitor Philip
Morris's permanent price cuts. The latter retreated Dollars 7/8 to Dollars
47 5/8.
Canada
TORONTO resumed its decline in fairly heavy trading, with gold issues
leading the way.
The TSE 300 index shed 8.8 to 3,867.4 and falls outpaced advances by 402 to
285. Volume came to 51.3m shares valued at CDollars 602.1m. The golds group
lost 1.3 per cent as the bullion price in New York fell USDollars 3.30 to
USDollars 388.65 an ounce.
Yesterday's drop marked the fifth fall in the past six sessions. After
closing just below the 4,000 mark on July 2, the 300-share index has tumbled
about 130 points.
