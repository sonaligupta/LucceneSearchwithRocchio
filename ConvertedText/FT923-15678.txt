FT  01 JUL 92 / UK Company News: UniChem to pay Pounds 14.5m for Scott
pharmacies


UNICHEM, the pharmaceutical wholesaler and retailer, is to pay Pounds 14.5m
for Scott, the Scottish chemist chain.
The acquisition will give UniChem a total of 194 pharmacies and underlines
the company's commitment to building a second core business in retail
pharmacy.
Scott made pre-tax profits of Pounds 458,000 on turnover of Pounds 16.5m in
the year to end-April 1992. It owns 31 chemists in the Glasgow area and has
interests in two health centres.
The purchase is being satisfied via Pounds 11.6m cash and Pounds 2.9m in
10-year loan stock.
Four of the Scott shops have annual sales of more than Pounds 1m and UniChem
expects its new pharmacies to contribute to profits in the first year.
It plans to take them into its retail chain under the Moss name.
Mr Jeff Harris, chief executive, said: 'This is an excellent buy for us, as
Scott is one of the few large groups of pharmacies left in the market. It
also strengthens our business in Scotland and underlines our commitment to
build a second core business of retail pharmacy.'
