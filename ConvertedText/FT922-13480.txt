FT  11 APR 92 / UK Company News: Profitability in sight for Star Computer


Star Computer Group sees 'every likelihood' of a return to profit for the
year to June 30 1992.
Over the six months to December 31 the group was still in loss.
But trading in recent months had 'significantly improved' with all areas of
business making a positive contribution.
The loss came to Pounds 240,000 (Pounds 253,000) but only with the help of
Pounds 21,000 interest received (Pounds 184,000 charged). Turnover fell to
Pounds 3.47m (Pounds 8m). Losses per share were clipped to 3.5p (3.7p).
While overheads had been reduced in almost all areas, R&D expenditure
continued and had led to significant improvements in product and service
offerings.
