FT  05 JUN 92 / Letter: Maastricht, A 'Perot factor' strikes a chord in
Europe (1)


   From Mr PETER SCOTT-HANSEN


Sir, Hurray for the Danes - Eurobusycrats beware] The Danish rejection of
Maastricht is Europe's 'Perot factor' come to life. And the Rio 'Summit'? -
chapter two. The American columnist George Will referred in a recent piece
to the new fad of Eco-pessimism as the 'socialist dream - ascetic lives,
closely regulated by the vanguard of bossy visionaries - dressed up as
compassion for the planet'.
Why not let the successful forces of economic pragmatism continue as the
magnet for European consolidation, and deny the self-serving 'b-eurocrats'
their grab at power and tax distortions. Too hasty a centralised social
agenda without solid popular support can lead to Yugoslavia on a grand
scale.
