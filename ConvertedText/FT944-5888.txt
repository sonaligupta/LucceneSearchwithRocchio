FT  01 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Verson forms Japanese joint venture


   By GEOFF DYER


Verson International, the Midlands-based capital equipment manufacturer,
which announced yesterday reduced interim pre-tax losses, has formed a joint
venture with a Japanese heavy machinery company.
The group has reached an agreement with Sumitomo Heavy Industries, the
specialised forging machinery manufacturer, to jointly market its products
in the US and Europe and to produce a large portion of these products at one
of Verson's factories.
Verson cut its pre-tax loss by 17 per cent from Pounds 2.87m to Pounds 2.39m
in the six months to July 31. However, turnover fell to Pounds 47.8m (Pounds
49.4m), reflecting a lower backlog of orders at the beginning of this year.
Interest charges increased to Pounds 2.46m (Pounds 2.36m). Mr Tim Kelleher,
chairman, said that borrowing was 'marginally higher' than at the year end,
when total debt reached Pounds 53.7m, giving a gearing ratio of 440 per
cent. The group plans to cut its debt by floating about 50 per cent of the
equity in its US operations on Nasdaq, in the next 10 to 22 months.
A charge of Pounds 750,000 was taken for the reorganisation of the UK press
business, Clearing International, where 80 people have been made redundant.
The subsidiary recorded an operating loss of Pounds 1.5m.
Income from royalties and service fees jumped to Pounds 1.99m (Pounds
667,000). New order intake in the first ten months of the year also improved
to Pounds 109m (Pounds 81.6m).
Losses per share were reduced to 1.65p (2p). There is no interim dividend.
The shares rose 1p to 16p.
