FT  20 APR 94 / Mexico bank chief begs to be ransomed


   By DAMIAN FRASER


   MEXICO CITY


The kidnapped president of Banamex-Accival, Mexico's largest financial
institution, has begged his business partners to pay the required ransom as
soon as possible.
In a letter sent to the Mexican press, Mr Alfredo Harp Helu asked Banamex
directors to arrange a credit to pay the ransom demand, reported to be
Dollars 50m (Pounds 34m). He urged his partners not to use professional
advisers in negotiations on the ransom, and promised to repay loans made on
his behalf.
'Why do you not respond? What is the point of keeping me in this situation?
Why prolong my captivity further? Sadly I realise the idea prevails that my
life is not in danger and that I am under pressure to write, which is not
true,' the letter said.
'The idea of being executed worries me terribly when I have the wealth to
guarantee payment of the ransom.'
Mr Harp, whose fortune is estimated at about Dollars 1bn, was kidnapped on
March 14. The letter is the second from him that has been given to the
press. Last week, the kidnappers threatened to kill Mr Harp unless the
ransom was paid.
He is understood to have been insured by Banamex against kidnapping. The
insurance company is reported to have hired US specialists to carry out
negotiations. In an earlier communication, the kidnappers had rejected an
insurance company's offer of ransom as insufficient.
The kidnapping had sent Mexico's stock market plunging and continues to
concern the country's close-knit financial community. In a separate letter,
Mr Harp said the only motive for his kidnapping was financial.
