FT  27 MAY 93 / Letter: EBRD's role crucial, but review necessary


   From Mr DAVID A J BURNS


Sir, Your continued attacks on the management of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, and on the 'lifestyle' of its chairman
('High fliers face internal scrutiny at EBRD', May 24), risk undermining the
effectiveness of an institution which is making an invaluable contribution
to the economic development of the countries of eastern Europe.
As someone who has had quite a few years' experience in doing business in
the area both before and after the collapse of the communist regimes, I
believe the creation of such an institution has provided a crucial
cornerstone for the structuring and provision of the necessary long-term
debt and capital that the economies of eastern Europe require.
The complexities and difficulties of doing business in the area are well
known and all would concur with the need for a supra-national body to
co-ordinate and establish a basis for an investment philosophy that will
contribute to long-term economic growth.
From the outside, the processes of the EBRD might appear to be cumbersome
and slow, but the fact is the bank is staffed by highly qualified
professionals who understand the business environment, the applicable
products and the credit criteria which must necessarily underpin the
provision of development capital.
You may well feel that some of the FT's readers are interested by the colour
of the marble, the use of corporate jet services and the cost of Christmas
parties, but I have no doubt that many others are more interested in what
the EBRD has done since its creation a mere two years ago.
