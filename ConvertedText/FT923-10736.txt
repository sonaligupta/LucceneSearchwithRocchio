FT  29 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Mitie achieves 47% rise to Pounds 1.8m


Mitie Group, the building services company, achieved a 47 per cent increase
to Pounds 1.8m in pre-tax profit for the year ended March 31. Turnover leapt
60 per cent to Pounds 52.3m.
Trident Maintenance Services, the Scottish painting company acquired in
January, exceeded warranted profits, Mr David Telling, chairman, said.
A higher tax charge of Pounds 637,000 (Pounds 275,000) meant that earnings
per share were up by only 4.5 per cent to 11.6p (11.1p).
A recommended final dividend of 1.5p makes a total of 2.75p (2p).
