FT  29 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Parties fight on council services -
News in Brief


   By ALISON SMITH


THE TWO main parties took the Citizen's Charter campaign into the debate on
local-government services yesterday, as each claimed the monopoly on
effective measures to provide quality in council services, Alison Smith
writes.
The claims came as ministers emphasised that the government had taken no
final decisions on how compulsory competitive tendering (CCT) should be
extended to local-authority white-collar services such as architecture.
Mr Michael Portillo, the local-government minister, said that although the
government had suggested a 'double envelope' tendering process in the
consultation paper published last November, it was looking to professional
bodies to make suggestions on devising a system.
Mr David Blunkett, Labour's local-government spokesman, said that the
government's opposition to proposed Labour changes to the bill, such as
those which would enable councils to introduce customer contracts, exposed
its stance as 'hollow rhetoric'.

EXPORTS TO IRAQ: A prototype Iraqi supergun made with parts supplied by
Walter Somers, the Halesowen steel company, was test-fired four times, MPs
will hear today.
The final firing took place in September 1990, after the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait and only three months before the beginning of the Gulf war.
The disclosure comes in written evidence submitted by Customs and Excise to
the Commons trade and industry committee.

RAIL TRANSPORT: A bill giving the go-ahead for construction of a Channel
tunnel rail terminal at London's King's Cross finally completed its Commons
stages last night after a battle lasting three years.
The measure - the King's Cross Railways Bill - had become bogged down in
controversy over a number of issues ranging from cost to environmental
impact.
It was given a third reading by a comfortable majority of 157 (162 votes to
5) and now passes to the Lords.
