FT  05 JUN 92 / Observer: What makes a governor


Where will the British government's new policy of open-ness end? To judge by
the spate of advertisements for such politically sensitive posts as chairman
of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission and Director of Public
Prosecutions, Prime Minister Major's team seems determined to give everyone
a shot at the top jobs.
Or is it?
Even Observer has to admit that the line between cosy appointments and open
competition has to be drawn somewhere. Advertising in the press for a new
boss of MI5 or MI6 might attract the wrong sort of candidate. But surely a
case could be made for advertising senior posts in the civil service or the
governorship of the Bank of England?
Given that Robin Leigh-Pemberton will step down as Governor next year and
should collect the traditional peerage, there should be lots of interest in
his job. However, the authorities seem shy, to say the least, about whether
they intend to advertise for his successor in the press.
Part of the problem is that any job-description for the governorship would
almost certainly infringe either the Trade Descriptions or the Sex
Discrimination Act, if not both, and could hardly fail to upset the Equal
Opportunities Commission.
For a start, the candidate would have to be good at nods and winks and be
generously endowed with that mysterious City quality, 'bottom'. An ability
to be either totally subservient to the Treasury or completely independent,
on demand, would be useful.
A further must could well be demonstrable ability to terrify financial
markets with the spectre of another Labour government.
