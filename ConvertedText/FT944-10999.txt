FT  08 NOV 94 / International Company News: Record oil results boost CanPac
in third quarter


   By ROBERT GIBBENS

Canadian Pacific, the transport, resource, hotels and property group,
registered a third-quarter profit due to record results from its oil and gas
subsidiary.
Group net profit was CDollars 87.6m (USDollars 64.5m), or 25 cents a share,
against a loss of CDollars 15.1m, or 5 cents, a year earlier. Revenues were
flat at CDollars 1.78bn against CDollars 1.6bn.
Operating income was CDollars 279m, up 14 per cent. PanCanadian Petroleum
contributed CDollars 129m, a jump of 84 per cent. Rail operations were hit
by a long strike at the Soo Line unit in the US, which was suspended at the
end of August, though Canadian traffic was higher. CP Rail contributed
CDollars 5.5m, down from CDollars 26.5m.
Shipping, coalmining and hotels all increased their contributions.
Nine months' net profit jumped to CDollars 306.9m from CDollars 105.8m, on
revenues of CDollars 5.2bn against CDollars 4.6bn.
In the nine months, shipping expanded container operations and improved its
rates, while operating costs declined. Property was helped by higher office
occupancies, with a stronger tourist season and the lower Canadian dollar
contributing to the hotels division.
Laidlaw, the waste management group in which Canadian Pacific has an 18.8
per cent stake, contributed CDollars 6.6m against a loss of CDollars 87m.
However, losses increased to CDollars 88.7m from CDollars 53m at Unitel, the
telecommunications unit.
Mr William Stinson, chairman, said CP's fourth-quarter results should
continue the improvement.
