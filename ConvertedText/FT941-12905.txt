FT  27 JAN 94 / Israeli, PLO officials adjourn Cairo talks


   By MARK NICHOLSON


As Israel focused on peace talks with Syria, Israeli and Palestinian
officials yesterday adjourned their hastily arranged talks in Cairo, writes
Mark Nicholson.
The talks were called on Tuesday evening to try to hammer out an agreed
document that would break the deadlock on implementation of Palestinian
self-rule in the Gaza Strip and West Bank area of Jericho.
Palestine Liberation Organisation negotiator Nabil Shaath said: 'We are
making progress,' but did not elaborate except to say: 'All the day we have
been drafting.'
The main disagreements are over security arrangements at the border posts
between Egypt and Gaza and between Jordan and Jericho, how much land the
Israeli army will retain to protect Jewish settlers in Gaza and the size of
the Jericho area.
Israeli officials sought to dampen hopes that Mr Peres and Mr Yassir Arafat,
PLO chairman, would sign an agreement when they meet in Switzerland at the
weekend.
