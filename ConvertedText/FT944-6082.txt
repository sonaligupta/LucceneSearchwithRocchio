FT  30 NOV 94 / International Company News: Merck outlines cost-cutting
programme


   By RICHARD WATERS


   NEW YORK


Mr Raymond Gilmartin, the new chairman of Merck, the biggest US drugs group,
outlined a cost-cutting programme yesterday and said the company would
continue to concentrate on revenue growth to drive earnings in the years
ahead, writes Richard Waters in New York.
Mr Gilmartin, who was appointed chief executive of Merck this summer and
took over the chairman's job in November, was making his first public
comments since arriving at the drugs maker.
Speaking at an analysts' meeting, he said Merck intended to reduce its
manufacturing costs by Dollars 200m-Dollars 250m by the end of 1996, and its
selling and administrative expenses by Dollars 100m. The more important
tasks, he indicated, were to make Merck's Dollars 6.6bn acquisition of Medco
Containment Services last year pay its way, and to ensure revenue growth
through a series of new product launches.
