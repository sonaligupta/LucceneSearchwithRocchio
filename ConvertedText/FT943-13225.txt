FT  20 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets: Brazilian shares fall 4% in thin
trading volume


Shares in Sao Paulo accelerated a decline in late trade to close 4.2 per
cent down on lingering rumours that two banks were having financial problems
in liquidating operations in the stock and fixed-income markets.
The Bovespa index of the 56 most active shares lost 1,706 at 38,747.
Turnover was low at RDollars 164.6m (Dollars 177m).
Analysts said news of a postponement until today of a meeting of President
Itamar Franco's cabinet members to discuss proposed salary rises to civil
servants also weighed on stock prices. The market fears that the proposed
wage increases, if approved, will swell the federal workers' payroll by
Dollars 2.5bn, threatening the government's efforts to keep its 1994 budget
balanced.
Mexico
Mexican stocks fell for the seventh time in eight sessions in continued
light dealings, with investors sidelined by upcoming earnings reports and
currency worries.
The IPC index dipped 18.96 to 2,255.30. Volume, at 20m shares, was only
slightly above that of Monday, which was the slowest trading day for 10
months.
