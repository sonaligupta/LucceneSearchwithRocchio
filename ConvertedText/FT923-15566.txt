FT  01 JUL 92 / Observer: Capability Brown


If someone had suggested a week ago that the toast of transatlantic
tittle-tattlers Tina Brown was going to edit a serious magazine like the New
Yorker, the idea would have been treated with the same sort of disbelief
that greeted the rumours that she and her husband, ex-Sunday Times editor
Harold Evans, were returning to London to run The Observer.
However, it is a sign of how high she stands in the estimation of the New
Yorker's reclusive publisher Sy Newhouse that he should believe her capable
of reversing the fortunes of America's best known high-minded, not to say
high-brow, magazine. Now losing around Dollars 12m yearly, it badly needs
livening up.
Brown has certainly done a wonderful job revamping Vanity Fair. Since taking
the editor's chair in 1984, she has nearly quadrupled its circulation to 1m,
and managed to keep advertising rising in the midst of a steep recession.
Perhaps she will prove to be cast in the same mould as Harold Ross, the New
Yorker's first editor, who had a genius for picking talented writers even if
he did not always understand what they were writing about.
But whatever the likes of Dorothy Parker and James Thurber might have
thought about her arrival, the main thing is that she should keep up the
cartoons.
