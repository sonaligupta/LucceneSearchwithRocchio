FT  23 APR 93 / People: Rose steps into Coleman's cast-offs


Burton, the UK fashion retailing group, confirmed yesterday that John
Coleman had resigned as head of its Dorothy Perkins division. The company
would not comment on the reason for Coleman's departure, but there is
speculation that he is being considered for other senior retail positions.
He will be replaced by Stuart Rose, managing director of Burton's Evans
chain.
Rose, 44, spent the first 17 years of his retail career with Marks and
Spencer, 12 of them in the food division. For the final 18 months he worked
at M and S's highly successful Boulevard Haussmann branch in Paris.
He joined Burton in 1989 and worked as a buying and merchandising director
at the Debenhams department store chain before joining Evans.
Rose's eventual replacement at Evans will be Nick Hollingworth, managing
director of IS, the discount retailer that comes under the Evans umbrella.
