DELL Computer's shares rose Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 39 at mid-day
yesterday, when the US personal computer company reported what one Wall
Street analyst called truly amazing third-quarter results.
Sales by the Texas-based PC company, which sells computers by mail order and
over the phone, shot up 149 per cent to Dollars 570m from Dollars 229.3m in
the same period last year. Net earnings were Dollars 28.6m, or 72 cents a
share, up 120 per cent from Dollars 13m, or 35 cents.
This marks the third consecutive quarter in which Dell's revenues have
increased by over 100 per cent. 'We are continuing to gain market share from
both larger and smaller competitors,' said Mr Michael Dell, chairman and
chief executive.
Recently, Mr Dell predicted an end to the price war that has slashed profit
margins throughout the PC industry. 'We are overwhelmed with demand, so if
we lowered prices it would be like a self-inflicted wound,' he said.
Dell's domestic sales increased 138 per cent to Dollars 377m. International
sales surged 172 per cent to Dollars 193m.
For the first nine months, sales increased 131 per cent to Dollars 1.4bn,
against Dollars 604m last time. Net income was Dollars 70m, or Dollars 1.81
a share, 98 per cent higher.
