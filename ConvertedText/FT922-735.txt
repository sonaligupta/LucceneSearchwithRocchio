FT  26 JUN 92 / Latin Americans advised to spread success widely


   By GEORGE GRAHAM


   WASHINGTON


US OFFICIALS are urging Latin American and Caribbean finance ministers to
spread the results of their new-found economic success more broadly among
their populations.
At a meeting in Washington yesterday of ministers from selected countries in
Latin America and the Caribbean, the US called for a continuation of the
economic reforms that have taken root in many countries over the past three
or four years and helped to curb the runaway debt problems that hamstrung
them in the 1980s.
'What now has to take place is not only a continuation of those reforms, but
they have to become more broadly shared,' a senior US Treasury official
said.
'Obviously, in order to keep the people of Latin America convinced that this
is something good for them, the economic fruits of these reforms can't all
be in the stock market; they have to flow down to the people,' he added.
The US warning follows an attempted military coup in Venezuela in February,
which was partly attributable to discontent over the harsh impact of the
country's economic reform programme, backed by the International Monetary
Fund.
This had made life harder for many of the poor and the middle class by
cutting government subsidies.
'There is an increasing recognition in Latin America that the consolidation
of economic reforms requires good governance and a social agenda,' commented
Mr Richard Feinberg, president of Inter-American Dialogue, a
Washington-based policy centre.
He noted it was easier to stress democratic values as an important component
of economic reform now that the Cold War was over and the US was no longer
supporting so many dictators in Latin America.
