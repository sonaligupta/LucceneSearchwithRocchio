FT  12 NOV 92 / International Company News: Nordisk hit by currency upheaval


   By HILARY BARNES

NOVO Nordisk, the Danish pharmaceuticals and enzymes group, yesterday
reported a 20 per cent drop to DKr330m (Dollars 53.92m) in 1992
third-quarter pre-tax profits, against the same period a year ago.
The company said it had been hampered by the currency turbulence in
September. The quarter incurred net financial costs of DKr121m compared with
net financial income of DKr45m last year.
However, Nordisk, which expects capital investment to increase to DKr2bn
this year from from DKr1.3bn in 1991, reported strong gains for the whole
nine months, with pre-tax profits 15 per cent ahead at DKr1.27bn.
Earnings per share rose 8 per cent to DKr23.84.
Based on current exchange rates and interest levels, Nordisk said that
pre-tax earnings for the full year were expected to increase by about 15 per
cent from last year's DKr1.46bn.
Nine-month sales were ahead by 16 per cent to DKr7.95bn after an increase of
20 per cent in sales by the bio-industrial enzymes division to DKr2.38bn and
by 11 per cent to DKr5.18bn in the health care division, where sales of
insulin, human growth hormone and gynaecological products all increased.
Sales growth was largely a result of volume increase, the group said.
Net financial costs for the nine-month period increased to DKr62m from DKr2m
last year.
Unidanmark, Denmark's second biggest banking group, has raised DKr3.3bn in
supplementary capital from 27,000 subscribers.
Institutional investors put up DKr2bn, but the rest has been subscribed by
the bank's customers.
