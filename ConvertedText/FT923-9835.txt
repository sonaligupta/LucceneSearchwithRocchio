FT  03 AUG 92 / Letter (1): Devaluation, a common currency and the answer to
Britain's current account deficit


   From Mr KEITH TUNSTALL


Sir, Walter Ellis's fascinating analysis (Personal View, July 29) leaves one
ultimately stranded. What is to be done?
The message seems to be that we should not be borrowing abroad to invest at
home. The demand for foreign borrowings to invest is surely not the problem
it was. But how much of current borrowing is forced by the need to service
previous borrowings? And how far is the government now having to borrow to
finance the public sector borrowing requirement and so keeping up the demand
for foreign capital?
Lower interest rates would discourage foreign lenders. And as long as we
keep interest rates higher than the rate of inflation then there is a good
chance we can keep high domestic savings. But that brings us back full
circle as to whether lower interest rates would force devaluation and raise
inflation.
Clear, the problems of defending the pound and worrying about our current
account deficit would disappear if we had a common European currency.
