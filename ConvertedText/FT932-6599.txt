MARTIN & Co, South Africa's top stockbroking firm, is teaming up with Robert
Fleming, the UK merchant bank, in a partnership aimed at developing their
international mining brokerage business.
Robert Fleming will buy from McIntosh Securities, a listed Australian
broker, its half-stake in McIntosh Martin, a joint venture with Martin & Co.
When the deal is completed, McIntosh Martin, which trades in South African
securities held by non-residents, will be renamed Copthall Martin.
Robert Fleming intends supporting Martin & Co in widening the scope of the
joint venture, particularly in the corporate finance area.
Mr Winston Floquet, managing director of Martin & Co, said: 'We are
delighted to be involved in a firm of Flemings' standing.
'What particularly attracted us was its global network, its roots in the
investment business, and an affinity with its people and culture.'
