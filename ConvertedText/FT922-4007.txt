FT  08 JUN 92 / Extended reform of 'check-off' considered


   By DAVID GOODHART


THE GOVERNMENT is examining ways of extending its proposed reform of the
'check-off' system - by which employers deduct union dues directly from pay
packets - to include the political levy paid by most trade unionists.
The trade union bill, promised in the Queen's Speech, will include a
proposal requiring union members covered by 'check-off' - about 70 per cent
of the total - to approve of the arrangement every three years.
Department of Employment officials said yesterday that Mr Michael Forsyth,
the employment minister, was considering adding a requirement that union
members on 'check-off' should also positively approve of the political levy
at the same time every three years.
Such a move would further cut the flow of funds to the debt-ridden Labour
party, already facing a cut in union funding. The 1984 Trade Union Act
required unions to vote every 10 years on whether to retain a political fund
but did not change the onus on opting out of paying the political levy.
