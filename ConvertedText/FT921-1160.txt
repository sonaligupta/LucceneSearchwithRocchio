FT  25 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Labour's election broadcast


LABOUR'S election broadcast last night showed a young girl in pain waiting
for a National Health Service ear operation while another girl, whose mother
writes a Pounds 200 cheque, receives private treatment. Scenes from the film
are shown to the right.
Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, says in it: 'If the Conservatives win,
they will continue to privatise the NHS and make it more like the American
system.'
