FT  27 JUL 92 / Concern at bids for EC funds


   By NEIL BUCKLEY


BRITISH businesses are failing to take advantage of sizeable benefits they
might be elegible for from the European Commission's Thermie programme,
which provides EC funding for energy conservation projects, according to the
Association for the Conservation of Energy.
Mr Andrew Warren, director of the association, which represents a number of
companies active in the energy conservation industry, told a conference this
weekend that insufficient British bids were being made for funds.
The UK had received only 12 per cent and 10 per cent of the available budget
for energy saving and for renewable energy projects respectively, when its
rightful share should be around 18 per cent.
The EC is today launching a leaflet designed to explain to businesses how
they can benefit from Thermie.
Funding of up to 40 per cent can be awarded to projects involving a first
application of new processes or products on a sufficiently large scale.
Mr Warren said the programme was due in 1993 to enter a new phase,
concentrating on technologies to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and
sulphur dioxide. It was vital that British businesses bid for as much as
possible of the Pounds 250m available in 1993 and 1994.
