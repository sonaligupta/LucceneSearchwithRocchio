FT  25 MAR 92 / Brown beats Clinton in US poll


   By GEORGE GRAHAM


   WASHINGTON


GOVERNOR Bill Clinton of Arkansas, frontrunner in the race for Democratic
nomination for the US presidency, suffered a setback last night when he was
pushed into second place in the primary election in the state of
Connecticut.
Mr Jerry Brown, former governor of California, scored an upset victory which
renewed doubts about Mr Clinton's candidacy.
With about 81 per cent of the votes counted, Mr Brown had 38 per cent to Mr
Clinton's 35 per cent. Mr Paul Tsongas, the former Massachusetts senator,
got 20 per cent even though he announced last week he was quitting the
presidential race.
Mr Tsongas was considered almost certain to have won Connecticut if he had
stayed in the race.
Mr Clinton still holds a commanding advantage in the number of delegates
committed to him at the Democratic nominating convention in July, and last
night's result does not diminish the probability he will clinch his party's
nomination.
But Mr Brown, whose attacks on Mr Clinton in the last fortnight have been
vicious and who stands a good chance of repeating yesterday's victory in
Vermont's tiny primary next Tuesday, will be able to wound his opponent over
the next two months.
President George Bush, meanwhile, again easily defeated his rightwing
challenger, Mr Patrick Buchanan, in the Republican primary in Connecticut.
