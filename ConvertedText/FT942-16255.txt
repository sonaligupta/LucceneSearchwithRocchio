FT  12 APR 94 / Hebron march halted by Israeli troops


An Israeli paratrooper pushes a Palestinian with his rifle during
yesterday's attempted march to the Ibrahimi mosque, scene of February's
Hebron massacre when 29 worshippers were killed by a Jewish settler. The
march was halted by troops who fired tear gas and concussion grenades. Four
Palestinians were later wounded by gunfire. Israel said yesterday it would
not be able to meet tomorrow's deadline for withdrawal from the occupied
territories. Israel to delay pull-out, Page 6
