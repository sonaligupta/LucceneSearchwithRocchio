FT  15 APR 94 / Lords amend Sunday shops bill


The Lords last night changed the Sunday trading bill to allow motor
suppliers, garden centres and DIY shops to trade without restriction on
Sundays, regardless of size.
The move was approved in spite of fears expressed by Earl Ferrers, Home
Office minister, that it could face problems in the Commons.
Both houses have already decided that small shops should be able to trade
without restriction on Sundays but that shops of more than 280 sq m should
be limited to six hours.
