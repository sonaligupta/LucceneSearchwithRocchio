FT  10 JAN 92 / Airbus partners' problems put new airliner in doubt


   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent

SEVERE financial and mangement problems among the three main partners in the
European Airbus Industrie consortium are jeopardising the development of a
new airliner.
Although Airbus trebled its operating profits to a record Dollars 300m last
year, Mr Jean Pierson, the managing director, said the consortium risked
being destabilised by the problems at Aerospatiale of France, Deutsche
Aerospace and British Aerospace.
As well as the development of the 120-seat A319 narrow-bodied airliner,
derivatives of the consortium's new A330/A340 wide-bodied aircraft may also
be threatened.
The consortium's vulnerability to the difficulties of its partner companies
is one of its biggest handicaps in the cut-throat commercial airliner
business. The present problem has also highlighted the need to turn Airbus
into a more conventional corporate entity distinct from its principal
shareholders and its national governments.
It is the cash-strapped French company, Aerospatiale, which has triggered
the latest crisis.
Aerospatiale, which has a 37.9 per cent stake in Airbus, is understood to be
opposed to developing the A319, itself a derivative of the A320
narrow-bodied airliner. However, the other main partners - BAe with 20 per
cent and Deutsche Aerospace with 37.9 - say they are ready to support the
Dollars 300m (Pounds 165m) development.
The fourth Airbus partner is CASA of Spain with 4.8 per cent.
Deutsche Aerospace at first opposed the A319 for fear that it would compete
with a family of 100 to 120-seat regional airliners which it was planning to
build. But the German group has since scaled down its programme to the
90-100 seat range so as to make it compatible with the A319.
Mr Pierson said yesterday the Airbus board had to decide on the A319 by the
end of March. But Aerospatiale's management evidently feels hamstrung by
anxieties about the financing of its share of the programme.
It is facing a cash squeeze because of declining defence business and heavy
outflows to finance the build-up of production at its new Toulouse facility
for the A330/A340 programme.
The company also faces considerable uncertainty about its future status.
The French government, which recently launched a restructuring of the
state-owned nuclear and consumer electronics industry, is considering an
analogous reorganisation of its state aerospace and defence assets. This
could eventually entail a regrouping of Aerospatiale, Thomson CSF, and
perhaps the Dassault military aircraft group.
BAe and Deutsche Aerospace have their own problems. BAe is in the midst of a
far-reaching restructuring after its management crisis last year. Deutsche
Aerospace, the aerospace subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, is seeking to establish
its identity as a leading company in the sector and is expected to undergo
further restructuring.
Apart from the A319, Airbus is studying whether to develop stretched and
smaller versions of the A330/A340 wide-bodied airliners. The timing of these
programmes risks being compromised unless there is agreement between the
Airbus partners.
Mr Pierson did not disclose figures for operating profits, but industry
analysts put the operating surplus last year at about Dollars 300m, compared
with just over Dollars 100m in 1990.
Airbus won 101 new aircraft orders last year, which was 44 short of its
target of 145 for 1991, and sharply lower than the 404 orders it won in
1990.
Mr Pierson said the target this year was about 150 new orders. Airbus
turnover this year should total about Dollars 7.7bn, similar to the sales
level last year.
Airbus delivered 163 aircraft last year and expects to deliver about 160
this year.
