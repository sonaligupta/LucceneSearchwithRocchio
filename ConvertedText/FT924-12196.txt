FT  22 OCT 92 / Multi-party pressure group formed in Malawi


   By REUTER


   BLANTYRE


A GROUP of former civil servants and politicians have formed a front to
campaign for multi-party democracy in Malawi, according to the official
Malawi News Agency (Mana), Reuter reports from Blantyre.
The United Democratic Front brings together several former top members of
Malawi's sole legal party, the Malawi Congress party, who over the years
fell foul of self-declared Life President Kamuzu Banda's unchallenged rule.
The agency quoted a UDF statement as welcoming Mr Banda's announcement on
Sunday that a referendum would soon be held in Malawi to decide if the
country wanted pluralist politics. But the UDF said Mr Banda's government,
in power since Malawi's independence from Britain in 1964, had to ensure
adequate time was allowed for a nationwide debate on the merits and demerits
of one-party and multi-party politics.
Other conditions included equal access to state-run media by those
campaigning for and against one-party government and international
monitoring of the referendum.
Mr Orton Chirwa, a leading opponent of Malawi's President Banda and the
country's first attorney-general, has died in a Malawi prison, an opposition
spokesman said yesterday.
Mr Chirwa and his wife Vera had been in prison since their abduction from
Zambia in 1981. They had gone into exile in Tanzania following an abortive
cabinet revolt against Mr Banda and his policies in 1964.
