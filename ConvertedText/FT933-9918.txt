FT  06 AUG 93 / International Company News in Brief: Eastman Kodak


   By NIKKI TAIT


   NEW YORK


Eastman Kodak, the photographic products company which is in the throes of
restructuring, prompted a wave of speculation on Wall Street yesterday when
it announced that it would make a significant announcement this morning,
writes Nikki Tait in New York.
The company declined to elaborate on the announcement, but some analysts
believed that Kodak could be poised to name a new finance director. The
former chief financial officer, Mr Christopher Steffen, quit in April after
only 11 weeks with the company, because of a management disagreement with
Kodak's chairman, Mr Kay Whitmore.
