FT  07 AUG 93 / London shares close at record high


LONDON shares closed at a record high on beliefs that the European exchange
rate mechanism will soon allow interest rate cuts.
The FT-SE 100 index finished at 2,969.8, up 26.4 points on the day and UK
gilts closed 1 point up. The Paris bourse also ended 1.6 per cent higher at
a record close.
The D-Mark gained against most other European currencies as central banks
replenished their reserves of the German currency.
Although the French and Belgian francs and the Danish krone all finished
below their old floors against the D-Mark, their falls were constrained by
signs that governments are in no rush to cut borrowing rates.
