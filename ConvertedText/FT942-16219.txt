FT  12 APR 94 / Hawke attacks media head

Mr Conrad Black, the Canadian media owner, has been accused by Mr Bob Hawke,
former Australian prime minister, of not telling the truth about his claim
that the government had encouraged him to lift his stake in the Fairfax
publishing group to 35 per cent.
Mr Hawke, testifying before a Senate inquiry into foreign ownership of
Australian newspapers, said: 'The simple fact is that Conrad Black does not
tell the truth.'
The inquiry, which started in December, is investigating Mr Black's claim
that Mr Paul Keating, Mr Hawke's successor, had told him he would be allowed
to buy a 35 per cent share in Fairfax in exchange for 'balanced coverage' by
the group's publications during the election in March last year. It aims to
establish whether Mr Keating had sought to influence the decision of the
Foreign Investment Review Board.
