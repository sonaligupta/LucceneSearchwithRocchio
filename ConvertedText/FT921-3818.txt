FT  12 MAR 92 / Lebanon curbs bread price rise


   By REUTER


   BEIRUT


Lebanon's government limited rises in prices of bread and fuel yesterday to
try to calm public discontent, Reuter reports from Beirut.
A government decree reduced the rise in bread prices from 32.5 per cent to
16.5 per cent and petrol prices from 28 per cent to 17 per cent.
President Elias Hrawi's government made up the shortfall by raising tax on
imported alcohol by 400 per cent. Taxes on imported cigarettes were also
increased.
The decision was taken after a six-hour cabinet discussion on the economic
crisis caused by a sharp drop in the value of the Lebanese pound, down 25.8
per cent in three weeks, which has sent prices of commodities, many
imported, soaring by 30 to 50 per cent and provoked public discontent.
