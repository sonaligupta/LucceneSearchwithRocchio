FT  28 MAR 92 / US to buy new Russian reactor


   By GEORGE GRAHAM


   WASHINGTON


THE US government yesterday said it would buy a Russian experimental nuclear
reactor designed to power space travel, as part of a Dollars 14m (Pounds 8m)
Russian space technology purchase.
The White House said the purchase of the Topaz reactor from Moscow's
Kurchatov Institute would give the US access to its technology, which many
scientists believe is not matched by any current US reactors, at a
significantly lower cost.
The Topaz was originally sought by the Strategic Defence Initiative
Organisation which runs the US 'Star Wars' anti-missile defence programme,
but for the past 15 months its purchase has been held up the Defence
Department.
The disagreement encapsulates a contentious debate within the US government
over what attitude to adopt towards the space, nuclear and military
industries of the former Soviet Union.
Members of Congress such as Senator Pete Domenici of New Mexico, as well as
some members of the administration, have argued that the US should buy
equipment and services from Russia, both to obtain new technologies cheaply
and to provide gainful employment for crucial scientists and engineers who
might otherwise be tempted to sell their services to countries in the Middle
East or the Third World and so contribute to the proliferation of advanced
military technologies.
The Defence Department, however, has appeared reluctant to agree to such
purchases.
The Topaz reactor will be acquired without nuclear fuel, and will be worked
on at the University of New Mexico, in Mr Domenici's home state, to see how
its technology can be adapted for use in the US space programme.
