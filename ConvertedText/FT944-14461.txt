FT  22 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Building societies report fall in
mortgage lending - At a glance


Building societies reported a rise in new savings but a fall in mortgage
lending in the wake last month of a half percentage point increase in
interest rates. Net retail receipts were Pounds 322m - the highest monthly
level since May and more than three times the August figure of Pounds 91m.
However, net new commitments for mortgages dropped to Pounds 2.97bn,
compared with Pounds 3.02bn in August. Adrian Coles, director-general of the
Building Societies Association, which released the figures, said that new
savings products may have helped to boost societies' inflow despite tough
competition from National Savings.
