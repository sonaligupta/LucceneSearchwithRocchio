FT  08 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Enlarged Prowting moves ahead sharply to
Pounds 4.42m


   By RICHARD WOLFFE


Pre-tax profits at Prowting, the housebuilder, increased eightfold in the
six months to August 31, reflecting an acquisition and growth in
part-exchange sales.
In its first interim figures since the Pounds 22.6m purchase of Galliford
Homes in September last year, Prowting reported pre-tax profits of Pounds
4.42m (Pounds 519,000).
Turnover increased to Pounds 44.5m (Pounds 15.6m) as sales rose from 165 to
511 units, of which Galliford contributed 267.
Part-exchange now accounts for about 50 per cent of sales, compared with 40
per cent last year, with most second-hand homes selling within 12 weeks.
The average selling price rose slightly from Pounds 85,000 to Pounds 86,000,
but the company forecasts little or no price inflation this year.
'The housing market still remains fragile,' said Mr Terry Roydon, chief
executive. 'None of us wishes to return to a boom-and-bust economy, but
nevertheless I trust that interest rates will not increase further in the
short term.'
Operating margins rose from 10 to 13 per cent, despite building costs
increasing by between 1 and 2 per cent.
Net borrowings at the interim stage stood at Pounds 24.9m (Pounds 20.1m),
for gearing of 35 per cent. Prowting expects this to rise to as much as 50
per cent as it continues to purchase land.
The company currently has 5,800 plots with planning permission, equivalent
to five years' building.
Earnings per share rose from 0.3p to 3.6p. The interim dividend is 1.9p
(1.7p). Mr Roydon said the intention was to return progressively to the
historic dividend of 5p.
