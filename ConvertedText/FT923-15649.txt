FT  01 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zaire's cobalt output forecast
10% below target


   By REUTER


   TOKYO


ZAIRE'S COBALT production in 1992 will fall by nearly 10 per cent from a
target of over 9,000 tonnes, because of adverse climatic conditions, the
managing director of Gecamines, the state-owned mining company said
yesterday, reports Reuter from Tokyo.
Mr Atundu Liongo, who was in Japan, a major cobalt consumer, for discussions
with trading houses. said he was confident that Zaire and Zambia could
sustain a producer price of Dollars 25 a lb for cobalt for the rest of this
year. But many traders doubted this, saying that demand in the
industrialised countries was weakening.
The free-market price of cobalt was quoted at Dollars 23.50-Dollars 25 a lb
in Europe on Monday, unchanged from Friday.
Zaire and Zambia account for 70 per cent of world production of cobalt, a
strategic mineral used in alloys for making aircraft engines and turbines as
well as audio tapes. Mr Liongo declined to give a specific output target for
1992 and did not give 1991 output.
Zaire and Zambia agreed in early June to maintain for the rest of 1992 a
producer price of cobalt at Dollars 25 a lb. The two countries raised it to
this level from Dollars 11 in 1991. 'Before fixing the producer price at
Dollars 25, we consulted with our agents and Zambia,' said Mr Liongo.
On 1993 producer prices he said: 'It is premature now to talk about what we
will do next year. Let's see what impact it (producer price at Dollars 25)
will have on the market.'
