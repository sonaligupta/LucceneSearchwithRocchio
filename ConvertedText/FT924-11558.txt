FT  24 OCT 92 / Briefcase, Q&A: A house for my mother


MY WIDOWED mother wishes to move to a property worth about Pounds 30,000
more than her current home. I am not resident/ordinarily resident in the UK
for income tax purposes, but would like to assist my mother by lending her
the money. I am concerned about losing my tax status through having property
available for my use in the UK. In the event of my mother's death I would be
the sole beneficiary of her estate which would consist of the property only.
One solution would be for your mother's will to direct her executor to sell
the house (and not allow you access to it in the meantime). If the executor
in fact retained the keys, no reasonable tribunal of fact could hold that
the house had been available for your use after your mother's death.
It is rather a pity that you did not say where you are resident: the
potential consequences of dual residence may be mitigated by a double
taxation agreement.

soon as possible.
