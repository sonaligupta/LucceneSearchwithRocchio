FT  05 AUG 93 / Observer: Ball's up


Onto Observer's desk yesterday landed an article by Treasury permanent
secretary Sir Terence Burns, one of the Treasury's great survivors, destined
for a book of essays to be published this autumn marking Sir James Ball's
60th. He and Sir Terence were big buddies at the London Business School.
What a ghastly thought if the Brits should be aping that irritating little
German habit of bringing out a so-called Festschrift commemorating
significant birthdays or retirements of corporate worthies. Pompous Germans
issue Festschrifts because there is no equivalent of the Times Court
Circular page. In practice, they are chunky tomes that mostly just gather
dust on otherwise empty office bookshelves.
