FT  10 JAN 92 / Letter: The politics of taxation in boom and in recession


   From Mr DAVID FITZSIMON


Sir, It has often been said that the electorate gets the government it
deserves. I wonder, however, what we, in our collective wisdom, have done to
saddle ourselves with an administration which reduced taxation at the height
of an unsustainable boom and may now face the real possibility of a Labour
government promising higher taxation in the depths of a recession.
A sure way for Labour to achieve the necessary 10-point lead in the polls to
have a realistic chance of winning the next election requires John Smith,
the shadow chancellor, to admit that his party's taxation plans are no
longer appropriate (if they ever were) to Britain's current economic
circumstances. His policies run the risk of being the last straw which
finally breaks the back of consumer confidence.
The chances of such a public change of heart, however, are remote. Labour,
therefore, deserves to lose the next election. The problem for us
long-suffering voters is that the Conservatives barely deserve to win.
