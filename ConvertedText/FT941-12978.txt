CDollars 7.9m

The strong recovery at Mitel, the manufacturer of PBXs, integrated circuits
and telephone equipment that was formerly controlled by British Telecom,
continued in the third quarter.
Profit for the three months ended December 24 was CDollars 7.9m (USDollars
6m), or 7 cents a share, up from CDollars 1.4m, or 1 cent, a year earlier on
revenues of CDollars 129m, up 15 per cent.
Nine-month profit was CDollars 15.9m, or 13 cents, against a loss of
CDollars 9.3m, or 15 cents, on revenues of CDollars 351m, ahead from
CDollars 305m.
Strength in the December quarter came from higher PBX sales in the US and
rising demand for specialised circuits. Domestic business was also good, the
company said.
Imperial Oil, Canada's biggest integrated oil company, benefited from higher
downstream margins and higher petrochemical sales in the fourth quarter.
However, the improvements were partly offset by lower crude oil prices and
lower resource profits.
Fourth-quarter net income was CDollars 54m, or 28 cents, up 6 per cent from
CDollars 51m, or 27 cents, a year earlier on revenues of CDollars 2.1bn,
down 7 per cent. For the year, profit was CDollars 279m, or CDollars 1.44,
up 43 per cent from CDollars 195m or CDollars 1.01. Revenues were CDollars
8.9bn, down 3 per cent.
Imperial, 70 per cent held by Exxon of the US, has cash resources of more
than CDollars 1bn and may be planning an acquisition, analysts say.
