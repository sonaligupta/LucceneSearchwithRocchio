FT  24 AUG 92 / Portugal faces austerity year


   By REUTER


   LISBON


PORTUGAL'S Premier Anbal Cavaco Silva has promised to curb public spending
in a tough 1993 budget, but ruled out higher taxes, Reuter reports from
Lisbon. 'We will be very demanding with all those responsible for
controlling state money. I am determined not to allow any increase in
taxation, and to widen scope for private enterprise,' he told a rally of the
ruling Social Democrat party at the weekend.
He described 1993 as 'a year of rigour and containment' and pledged to
streamline the civil service. The premier's commitment to greater austerity
follows a central bank demand for budget deficit cuts to curb money supply
and inflation, at 9.5 per cent a year.
