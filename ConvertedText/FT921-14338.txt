FT  16 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Grattan cuts bonuses for workers to
reduce pay


   By MICHAEL SMITH


GRATTAN, the mail-order company, told 600 employees yesterday that it
planned to change bonus payments to reduce weekly earnings by an average of
Pounds 20, Michael Smith writes.
Although pay freezes have become increasingly common, few companies have
operated measures that have reduced pay.
Grattan, a subsidiary of Otto Versand of Germany, said each of the 600
workers affected, who are based in Bradford, would receive an ex-gratia
lump-sum payment equivalent to the bonus reduction for a full year.
Typically that would be about Pounds 1,000, but in a few cases it might be
up to Pounds 2,000. Grattan said it was also giving 12 months' notice of the
changes.
Usdaw, the shopworkers' union, said some workers would lose up to Pounds 40
a week.
Grattan, which employs 4,000 people, said the 600 affected earned an average
of Pounds 240 a week including bonuses of Pounds 95.
The alternative to the bonus cuts was job losses.
