FT  04 AUG 92 / Russian cabinet split over big credit boost

A ROW has broken out inside the Russian government, and between the
administration and the central bank, over the issuing of a further
Rbs1,000bn of credit by the bank to prop up large state companies struggling
under vast loads of debt.
Mr Pyotr Fillipov, chairman of the parliamentary sub-committee for
privatisation, said the move would 'push the country to the edge of an
horrendous economic crisis' and raise inflation to between 70-80 per cent a
month, from 15 per cent now.
Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the new acting chairman of the central bank,
promised to issue the credit at the end of last week, though most ministers
appear to be strongly opposed. However, at least two - Mr Georgy Khizha,
deputy prime minister, and Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, minister for fuel and
energy - were reported yesterday to support the move.
Even so, Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, the first deputy prime minister, is said to
be against the plan.
All three ministers were brought into the cabinet in June, in a move seen as
aimed at diluting the radicalism of the cabinet of Mr Yegor Gaidar, the
acting prime minister.
In an article in the newspaper Izvestia yesterday, Mr Fillipov said Mr
Gerashchenko's decision would destroy the economic policy of President Boris
Yeltsin and the government. The largest share of credits would go to
enterprises which had run up the largest debts because they sold nothing
anyone wanted to buy or had put up their prices beyond consumers' reach.
Mr Gerashchenko's policy - which is to support industry, attempt to pay back
foreign debts and postpone both the struggle against inflation and any
attempt to make the rouble convertible - is opposed, with increasing
directness, both to the policy of the government and to measures recommended
by the International Monetary Fund.
