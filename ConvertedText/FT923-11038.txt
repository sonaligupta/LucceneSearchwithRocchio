FT  27 JUL 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: South Korea wins first gold


An unknown novice South Korean markswoman snatched the first gold medal of
the Games yesterday in the air rifle event.
Yeo Kab-soon, an 18-year-old sports instructor, said she had thought she
might squeeze into the final eight but had never dreamt of taking gold ahead
of the experienced Vesela Letcheva of Bulgaria, the 1989 world champion.
Yeo notched up 498.2, just outside the world record of 500.8.
Yeo started Olympic air rifle shooting three years ago after watching the
event on television.
