FT  12 MAR 93 / Assembell Nationale (Elections '93): Rivalry between
France's two main opposition parties gains a new twist


   By DAVID BUCHAN


   PARIS


The rivalry between France's two main opposition parties to provide the
country's next prime minister gained a new twist in opinion poll findings
yesterday, writes David Buchan in Paris.
A Sofres poll suggested that Mr Edouard Balladur, the RPR's former finance
minister, would be far more popular as prime minister among the combined
supporters of the Gaullist RPR and centre-right UDF parties than any UDF
candidate. Mr Balladur has 41 per cent backing among UDF supporters alone.
But an Ifop poll in yesterday's edition of L'Express magazine put the UDF,
albeit by only half a percentage point, ahead of the RPR's general support
for the first time. They are opposing each other in only 69 constituencies.
