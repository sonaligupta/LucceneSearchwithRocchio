FT  25 MAR 92 / International Company News: Marui turns in first loss since
stock listing


   By ROBERT THOMSON


MARUI, the Japanese department store chain, reported an 8.7 per cent fall in
pre-tax profit to Y57.3bn (Dollars 428m) for the year to the end of January,
the company's first profit drop since its stock was listed in 1963, writes
Robert Thomson.
The company blamed a slim 0.6 per cent increase in sales to Y569bn on the
slowdown in the economy, which has eroded business confidence and been
accompanied by meagre growth in consumer spending.
Marui is best known for its fashionable, youth-oriented department stores,
and has been hit, along with other retailers, by sluggish sales of luxury
items and higher priced clothing lines.
For the current year, the company, which has expanded aggressively in recent
years, is expecting a 12.7 per cent fall in pre-tax profit to Y50bn, though
sales are expected to rise 5.4 per cent to Y600bn.
