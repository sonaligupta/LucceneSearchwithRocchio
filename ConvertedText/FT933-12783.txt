FT  22 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Medeva moves to rebuild investors'
confidence


   By RICHARD GOURLAY


MEDEVA, the rapidly growing UK drugs company that has suffered a halving in
its share price since issuing a profits warning on Monday, yesterday said it
will eschew 'further major acquisitions' for the time being.
In a letter to shareholders, Mr Bernard Taylor, chairman, said: 'The scale
of the fall in the company's share price would appear to reflect wider
concerns than could be accounted for by the revised profits forecast alone.'
The board recognised the company would have to face 'new constraints' with
an overriding challenge being to rebuild investor confi-dence.
Medeva's share price fell a further 8 1/2 p yesterday to 102p, bringing the
fall to 114p since Monday, when the company said it would make pre-tax
profits of between Pounds 43m and Pounds 47m in 1993, about Pounds 10m below
market expectations.
Rebuilding confidence would 'crucially depend' on the company's actual
profit performance in the future.
Mr Taylor said that the company's growth had been based on acquisition and
organic growth.
Medeva describes its strategy as capturing synergies between companies it
acquires, on revitalising products it buys, developing new products and
investing in the resulting growth opportunities.
'Looking ahead, the board believes that shareholders will be looking for
renewed evidence of the success of this strategy before any further major
acquisitions are contemplated.'
After its Pounds 94m rights issue in April, which repaid all debt and left
the group with a strong balance sheet, Medeva said it had about Pounds 100m
which it could deploy in acquiring more companies.
The company would still make 'smaller scale tactical acquisitions', the
letter said.
