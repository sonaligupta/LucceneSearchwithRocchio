FT  04 SEP 93 / Unions strongest in Merseyside


MERSEYSIDE is the only region where trade unionists make up the largest part
of the employed workforce, figures compiled by the GMB general union from
the government's latest labour force survey show.
Three years ago four other regions had workforces with more than 50 per cent
trade unionists: Tyne and Wear, the rest of the north-east, South Yorkshire,
and central Clydeside.
But since 1989 the proportion of the workforce in unions in Tyne and Wear
has fallen from 54 per cent to 47.4 per cent and in South Yorkshire from 50
per cent to 49.1 per cent. In inner London less than a third of the
workforce are in unions (32.2 per cent), about the same figure as four years
ago.
