FT  27 JAN 94 / International Company News: Flotation planned for Armco
Steel


   By RICHARD WATERS


Armco and Kawasaki Steel, the US and Japanese steel companies, are planning
to float their US joint venture, Armco Steel, as part of a Dollars 590m
recapitalisation of the heavily indebted company.
The transaction will effectively wipe out the two companies' existing equity
interest in the joint venture, which produces flat-rolled steel for the
auto, appliance and construction industries.
The financing is among the largest of a series of recapitalisations by steel
companies in recent months, a period in which companies have taken advantage
of an upturn in their shares to return to the public markets. It also marks
a decision by Armco and Kawasaki not to commit further capital to their
joint venture, which has racked up losses of more than Dollars 800m since
the beginning of 1990. The company returned to profit in the third quarter
of last year.
The two joint venture partners plan to raise Dollars 315m of new equity for
Armco Steel to pay off much of its existing debt and reduce its pension fund
deficit.
According to a filing in the US, the flotation will involve 15.75m shares at
around Dollars 20 each, equivalent to more than 75 per cent of the company's
equity after the recapitalisation is complete.
In addition, Kawasaki will exchange Dollars 100m of subordinated debt owed
it by Armco Steel for 5m shares in the newly capitalised company, giving it
a 24 per cent stake. The current equity in the company will be all but
extinguished in the transaction, reducing Armco's existing 50 per cent
interest to less than 1 per cent.
Armco Steel also plans to raise Dollars 275m of new long-term debt, leaving
it with Dollars 412m of long-term debt after the recapitalisation has been
completed.
