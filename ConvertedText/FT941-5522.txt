FT  05 MAR 94 / Briefcase, Q&A: Allocation of shares


With reference to the allocation of one Zeneca share for each ICI share
held: would I, for capital gains purposes, be correct in reducing the
capital cost of my ICI shares by half and treating the resulting sum as the
cost of the Zeneca allocation?
No. The split has to be made on the basis of the market values (on the
quarter-up basis) on the first day of dealing in the Zeneca shares, June 1
1993, viz 631 3/4 p for ICI and 625 3/4 p for Zeneca.
The cost of the Zeneca shares is, therefore, 49.76143 per cent of the CGT
base cost of the ICI stock. Ask your tax office for the free pamphlet CGT13
(the indexation allowance for quoted shares). Any apportionment factors
which you may need also can be obtained from your tax office.
