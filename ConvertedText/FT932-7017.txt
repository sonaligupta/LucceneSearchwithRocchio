FT  26 MAY 93 / People: Fyfe in line to head Devro


Devro International, the maker of edible sausage skins, is to announce the
appointment of David Fyfe as chief executive designate when it produces a
pathfinder prospectus later this week ahead of a stock market flotation.
Fyfe resigned last week as managing director of a division of Hickson
International, the specialty chemicals group, where he had been hoping for a
main board position.
Hickson chairman Dennis Kerrison said his departure was amicable. Fyfe was,
however, unlikely to make it to board level early as the board was stable
and set up like a continental supervisory board.
Fyfe will be in line to take over from Frank De Angeli, Devro's chief
executive, who is 68. Devro is expected to be valued at about Pounds 170m.
