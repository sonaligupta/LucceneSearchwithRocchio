FT  12 MAR 93 / WPP to raise Pounds 88m in rights


   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent


WPP, the marketing services group, yesterday announced a four-for-five
rights issue to raise Pounds 88m.
The company also reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 53.8m for the year
ending December 31, 1992, up from Pounds 38.36m in 1991. On an FRS 3 basis,
however, pre-tax profits were only Pounds 7.7m (against Pounds 56m), and
after a tax charge of Pounds 17.2m there was an Pounds 11.9m loss.
The rights issue is to be used for partial repayment on a Pounds 105m
bridging loan and for additional working capital.
It was signalled last summer, just before shareholders approved the group's
refinancing package. Four new ordinary shares will be offered for every five
ordinary shares. The new shares are priced at 45p each, a 25 per cent
discount on Wednesday's closing price. The issue is fully underwritten by
Samuel Montagu, which is retaining 20 per cent of the sub-underwriting.
Revenues increased 5.7 per cent last year to Pounds 1.27bn; revenues for the
first two months of 1993 are 4 per cent over the comparable period in 1992.
No dividend is to be paid, but the board forecast a dividend payment of 1p
for the 1993 financial year.
Exceptional losses of Pounds 30.58m included costs of Pounds 13.5m from the
August refinancing package; Pounds 15.73m of rationalisation costs
associated with some of the group's smaller companies; and Pounds 1.35m of
provisions for surplus property. Average net debt stood at Pounds 240m (from
Pounds 334m) at the end of 1992. Earnings per share before exceptional items
were 1.7p; on an FRS 3 basis, losses per share were 9.3p (against earnings
of 27.9p).
Group operating margins declined from 7 per cent to 6.9 per cent. Within the
group, the advertising agencies J Walter Thompson had operating margins of
8.7 per cent and Ogilvy & Mather 5.7 per cent.
Analysts are revising upwards forecasts for 1993 pre-tax profits to about
Pounds 67m. Mr Martin Sorrell, WPP group chief executive, said yesterday
that the planned disposal of the US advertising agency Scali McCabe Sloves
was progressing and proceeds would go towards repayment of the bridging
loan.
It is understood that the Interpublic Group of advertising agencies is
interested in buying Scali, for about Pounds 80m.
