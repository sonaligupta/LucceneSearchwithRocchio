FT  04 AUG 92 / Gas-fired stations win approval


THE Department of Trade and Industry yesterday gave planning consent for two
gas-fired power stations - at Shoreham, West Sussex, and Stallingborough,
Humberside.
These are the first consents for large power stations to be granted since
February, when Thames Power, the independent electricity generator, won
consent for a 1,000MW station on the Thames at Barking.
The DTI dismissed speculation that there had been any deliberate policy of
holding back consents because of fears that many of the new gas-fired
stations will be redundant.
Hydro-Electric, the integrated electricity company, has started burning
cheap North Sea gas at its Peterhead power station in Aberdeenshire.
The gas, from BP's Miller field, will replace oil and should add Pounds 6m
to the company's bottom line.
The backbone of an important new natural gas transmission system in the
North Sea was completed yesterday.
The 255-mile Central Area Transmission System pipeline will carry up to
1.4bn cubic feet of gas a day from the central North Sea to north-east
England.
