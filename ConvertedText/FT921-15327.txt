FT  10 JAN 92 / Observer: Laid to rest


The chickens have soon come home to roost on UK premier John Major's diktat
that farmers' future prosperity lies in supplying supermarkets. 'Oh yeah?'
ripostes Richard Simmonds, a Tory Member of the European Parliament who set
up a free-range egg-producing business in 1985.
On starting, he was paid Pounds 1.05 a dozen for top-sized eggs which the
supermarkets retailed at about Pounds 1.65. They then whittled down his
payment to 85p while raising the retail price to Pounds 2.38.
As a result he has closed down his poultry units which, incidentally, were
formally opened by agriculture minister John Gummer.
