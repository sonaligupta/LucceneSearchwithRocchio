FT  05 JUN 92 / UK Company News: TI buys 10% as Dowty bid nears close


   By RICHARD GOURLAY


TI GROUP, the specialist engineer, yesterday paid 189p a share for 10 per
cent of Dowty, the aerospace and information technology group that it is
pursuing via a hostile Pounds 525.7m bid.
The shares purchase, made only four days before the offer closes, increases
the chances that Dowty will lose its independence, particularly as brokers
were able to buy the stake relatively quickly.
'We are extremely pleased with today's market operation, which underlines
our confidence in the successful outcome of the bid,' TI said.
Dowty dismissed the purchase, saying: 'This 10 per cent we knew we were
going to lose, but they have had to pay an incredibly high price.'
TI paid about 14p above the 175p per share value of the cash alternative to
the 4-for-15 share offer, currently worth 193p.
In its latest letter to shareholders, TI stressed that the key issue in the
last days of the bid was which of the two companies' managements was best
suited to set and execute the correct strategy for Dowty.
Mr Christopher Lewinton, TI chairman, also questioned Dowty's ability to
turn the corner.
'I suspect that many shareholders had lost money on their Dowty shares
before TI made its bid.' he said. 'Now they should ask themselves whether
they believe Dowty's hollow promises or TI's solid record of creating
shareholder value.'
Dowty has consistently said that it is about to make a strong recovery after
recession hit years and the mistake of moving into information technology.
Contrary to what TI might claim, significant costs had already been taken
out of the business and shareholders, faced with a 7 per cent yield on their
shares and the genuine prospect of recovery, should stay with the existing
management, Dowty said.
Shares in TI added 7p yesterday to 364p and its target's price rose 6p to
182p.
