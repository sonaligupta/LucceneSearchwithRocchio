FT  24 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Co-op Bank deficit cut to Pounds 6m


   By DAVID BARCHARD


BAD DEBTS on its lending to small and medium sized business customers pushed
the Co-operative Bank into a loss for the second year running in 1991.
The pre-tax loss, after Pounds 45m in provisions against bad debts on the
bank's loan book of Pounds 2.7bn, was Pounds 6m, down from a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 14.9m in 1990.
In 1990 bad debt provisions totalled Pounds 57.2m.
Losses per share emerged at 1.2p (1.7p).
During the year, the size of the bank's balance sheet shrank from Pounds 3bn
to Pounds 2.8bn. There was also a reduction of 753 in the bank's staff which
now stands at 3,684. The restructuring of its operations cost the bank
Pounds 6.3m in exceptional costs.
Though the bank's bad debt experience remained poor in 1991, there were
fewer hits from large company failures than in the previous year.
Mr Terry Thomas, general manager, said that more than 60 per cent of the
bank's bad debts came from individual losses of below Pounds 500,000.
'The fashionable view is that these failures related to new and overgeared
companies established in the boom years of the 1980s, but sad to relate this
is not our experience.
'Many corporate customers of 10 years or more who had already survived one
or more recessions have perished during this incredibly difficult year,' Mr
Thomas said.
He said that the bank and its wholly-owned subsidiaries had all improved
their profits in 1990 despite the recession. Its cost-income ratio is now
11.3 per cent, compared to 11.5 per cent a year ago.
