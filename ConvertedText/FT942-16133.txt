FT  12 APR 94 / Observer: Sic transit


Meanwhile, relations have not exactly been wonderful between Abu Dhabi -
majority owner of the corrupt Bank of Credit and Commerce International -
and Touche Ross, the bank's liquidator, though outright war has so far been
avoided. Touche has sued BCCI's former auditor, Price Waterhouse - and even
the Bank of England - but has deployed a softly-softly approach with the
emirate.
Being nice doesn't necessarily pay off. At the end of March, Abu Dhabi
shipped to Touche's London office 70 tonnes of BCCI documents, all its head
office files, airlifted to Abu Dhabi in 1990. Creditors should not
over-excite themselves; despite being carefully sorted in the UAE, the index
has mysteriously disappeared in transit.
