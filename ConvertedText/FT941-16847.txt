FT  07 JAN 94 / Market set to give verdict on Metallgesellschaft rescue plan


   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES


   FRANKFURT


Investors' reactions to the proposed salvage plan for Metallgesellschaft
will be tested this morning when trading resumes in the debt-laden group's
shares.
The stock was suspended in Frankfurt yesterday following press reports of
losses last year of almost DM2bn (Pounds 700m) compared with the DM347m
deficit announced in November.
The metals, mining and engineering conglomerate confirmed late yesterday
that it expected to report a loss of DM1.8bn for the year to the end of
September 1993, and warned of a possible further DM1.5bn in obligations as
it unwound positions in the US oil futures markets.
In an early indication of the mood, bank stocks lost ground yesterday after
formal publication of details of the rescue scheme presented to the
company's creditors on Wednesday evening. Representatives of some 40 to 50
banks were asked to subscribe to a DM3.2bn package comprising a capital
injection, debt-for-equity deals and new credit.
According to banking sources, the group's top five creditors are Deutsche
Bank, Bayerische Landesbank, Credit Lyonnais, NordLB, and Societe Generale.
Credit Lyonnais yesterday confirmed it was owed DM246m, while Commerzbank
said its loans amounted to around DM200m.
Stock market traders were reportedly irritated that Mr Kajo Neukirchen, the
newly appointed group chairman, revealed further details of his plans in
television interviews. Mr Neukirchen warned that the alternative was
insolvency if the banks did not rally around.
Subsidiaries earmarked for disposal included a Canadian mining operation and
the Kolbenschmidt automotive components company. Bankers said the US oil
business and metals smelting operations were also likely to go.
