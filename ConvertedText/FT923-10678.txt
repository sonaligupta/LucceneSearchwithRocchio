FT  29 JUL 92 / Clifford facing BCCI indictment


   By ALAN FRIEDMAN


   NEW YORK


MR Clark Clifford, the former US defence secretary and presidential adviser,
is expected to be indicted today in connection with the Bank of Credit and
Commerce International (BCCI).
Mr Robert Altman, Mr Clifford's protege and law partner, is also expected to
face a BCCI-related indictment.
The men resigned last August as chairman and president of Washington's First
American Bank, which the Federal Reserve has said was illegally controlled
by frontmen acting for BCCI.
The likely indictment of the 85-year-old Mr Clifford, a power broker in the
Democratic party for the past two generations, had been rumoured in New York
and Washington. The Justice Department and Mr Robert Morgenthau, the New
York district attorney who is expected to bring the charges, both declined
to comment.
Investigators have been focusing on whether the two former executives lied
to US bank regulators more than a decade ago when they promised that BCCI
would have no ownership interest or other involvement in First American.
Mr Clifford has argued he was duped by BCCI, although he has a reputation as
a shrewd Washington insider.
He and Mr Altman have insisted repeatedly that they are innocent, with Mr
Clifford telling a congressional committee last year: 'Our consciences are
clear.'
