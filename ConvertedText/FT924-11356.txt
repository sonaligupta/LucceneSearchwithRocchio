FT  27 OCT 92 / International Company News: Court continues hearing on
future of NY Daily News


   By ALAN FRIEDMAN


   NEW YORK


THE FUTURE of The New York Daily News, the loss-making tabloid that was once
owned by the late Mr Robert Maxwell, remained unresolved yesterday morning
as a New York bankruptcy court began a third day of hearings.
The hearings, which began last Thursday, were supposed to result in a ruling
on the bid for the newspaper from Mr Mortimer Zuckerman, the owner of the
weekly US News and World Report magazine and The Atlantic, a monthly
magazine.
Although Mr Zuckerman's chances have been good since the withdrawal recently
of Mr Conrad Black, the Canadian newspaper proprietor, his bid has run into
problems concerning newspaper's typographers' union.
