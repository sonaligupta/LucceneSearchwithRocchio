FT  01 JUL 92 / Letter: Continuing role at Harvard Business Review


   From Ms ROSABETH MOSS KANTER


Sir, An inaccurate and misleading article about the Harvard Business Review
appeared in the Financial Times on May 29 ('Those who teach. . .').
I remain editor of a financially strong and editorially excellent magazine.
I will not be relinquishing the duties associated with this leadership
position, as your story stated, but will be accepting responsibilities as
vice-chairman of the board of directors of a proposed new Harvard Business
School Publishing Group, which will include books and videos as well as
magazines.
I have been editor for more than two years; and I would characterise my
association with the Harvard Business Review as a time when the magazine has
gotten stronger and stronger.
It is a sign of strength that we are preparing to establish a professional
publishing organisation off-campus, led by publishing professionals.
