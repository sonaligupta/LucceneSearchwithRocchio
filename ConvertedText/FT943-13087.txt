Japanese steelmakers plan to by-pass a Chinese government agency and export
5,000 tonnes of steel directly to two Chinese companies next month, agencies
report from Tokyo.
The emergency measure follows the collapse of bilateral talks on prices and
export levels, Kawasaki Steel said. It said the exports involved hot-rolled
steel plate produced by Kawasaki and five other blast furnace operators,
adding that prices would be about Dollars 20 a tonne higher than in the
first six months of this year. The other five companies are Nippon Steel,
NKK, Sumitomo Metal Industries, Kobe Steel and Nisshin Steel.
