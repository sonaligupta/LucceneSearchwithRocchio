FT  13 APR 94 / Ex-bank chief faces new claim

   MADRID


A Spanish parliamentary committee is to investigate fresh allegations
against Mr Mariano Rubio, former governor of the Bank of Spain, in the
latest of a series of embarrassing controversies facing the Socialist
government. Mr Rubio is due next week to appear before parliament's economy
committee to be questioned on allegations that he may have evaded tax on
investment gains while in office. The daily El Mundo newspaper last week
published reports claiming Mr Rubio had kept some Pta130m (Pounds 643,500)
in a secret account. Another case, over alleged illicit enrichment by the
former Civil Guard director, Mr Luis Roldan, another government appointee,
is already under investigation.
Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister, said earlier he had defended Mr
Rubio 'in good faith' over his links with a failed private banking venture,
Ibercorp. Mr Rubio, who was Bank of Spain governor from 1984 to 1992, was
questioned by a parliamentary committee over the Ibercorp affair two years
ago. There was no proof that he had behaved improperly.
