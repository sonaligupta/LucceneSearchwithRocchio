FT  20 APR 94 / Vauxhall halves dealer margins


   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent


Vauxhall is halving dealer margins for its new Omega executive car range in
an aggressive move aimed at reducing the official list prices.
The company is seeking to make the Omega, which will be launched on Friday,
the best-selling executive car in the UK ahead of the Rover 800. Its sales
target for next year is more than 19,500.
Vauxhall said yesterday that dealer profit margins were being cut from 10
per cent to 5 per cent for the Omega, the first time that a carmaker in the
UK has reduced margins to such a low level on a mainstream car range.
The company first led industry moves to reduce dealer margins in 1991, when
it cut margins on its Astra small family car range from 17 per cent to 10
per cent.
Low dealer margins greatly narrow the scope for discounts and haggling over
car prices. The move does not cut final transaction prices but brings them
closer to the official list price.
Most carmakers have since followed Vauxhall's initial move to 10 per cent
margins.
Vauxhall, the UK subsidiary of General Motors of the US, said the move to
cut dealer margins for the Omega was a response to recent changes in the
company car tax regime, which now relates tax scale charges to car list
prices rather than to engine sizes and transaction prices.
Some 80 per cent to 90 per cent of Omega sales are expected to be company
purchases. Omega prices will range from Pounds 15,995 to Pounds 26,950.
The company said that it had no plan to extend the lower dealer margins to
other cars in its range.
Vauxhall's move confirms the trend to lower dealer margins started by some
carmakers in recent weeks on special entry-level models where they have
reduced the official list prices of their cheapest models.
