FT  05 MAR 94 / New-car registrations surge by 14.75%


   By JOHN GRIFFITHS


The government's insistence that economic recovery is on course received a
boost yesterday from statistics showing a further surge in new car
registrations.
Registrations were 14.75 per cent higher last month than in February last
year and commercial vehicle sales appear to be firmly on the mend after
their steepest post-war recession.
In another positive development, the statistics, issued by the Society of
Motor Manufacturers and Traders, indicate that there has been no slump in
diesel car sales following a government-commissioned report, published in
January, which said there should be 'concern' about the long-term urban
pollution effects of a rising population of diesel cars.
The total new car market share taken by diesel cars reached 23.3 per cent
last month, up from 15.5 per cent in the same month last year. 'There
appears to have been no adverse effect at all,' said Citroen UK, which has a
leading share of the diesel market.
The lack of a downturn in diesel suggests that the cars are bought primarily
for economy. Carmakers also maintain that the report, by the Quality of
Urban Air Review Group, underestimated the technical progress that has been
made in cleaning up diesel emissions.
The 145,710 new car registrations in February - up from 126,984 the same
month a year ago - followed a 20 per cent year-on-year jump in January, so
that registrations in the first two months of the year, at 344,235, were
17.92 per cent ahead of the 1992 period's 291,923.
'These figures confirm continuing growth in the market as manufacturers
benefit from growing consumer confidence,' said Mr Roger King, the society's
public affairs director. Commercial vehicle registrations rose last month by
8.1 per cent to 16,312, following a rise of 1.3 per cent in January.
The negative side of yesterday's statistics was a rise in the share of the
market taken by imports. They accounted for 57.54 per cent, compared with
53.78 per cent the previous February.
Sharply rising imports of Vauxhall's Corsa from Spain and Ford's Mondeo from
Belgium were among the main factors for the rise. The Mondeo, with 27,566
registrations, is leading the best sellers' list after the first two months,
Second is Ford's Escort at 26,477 and third is Ford Fiesta at 22,623. Then
came Vauxhall Astra, 20,376; Vauxhall Cavalier, 20,064; Vauxhall Corsa,
16,707; Rover 200 15,312; Renault Clio, 9,378; Peugeot 405, 8,976; in tenth
place is Rover Metro with 8,828.
