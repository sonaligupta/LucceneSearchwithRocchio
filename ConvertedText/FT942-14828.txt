FT  19 APR 94 / Curb on lookalike brands opposed


   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent


MPs on both sides of the Commons last night urged the government to refuse
trademark protection for brand-name goods facing competition from lookalike
products.
The dispute has come to a head this week as J. Sainsbury launched a cola
designed to compete with Coca-Cola, the brand leader.
Mr Patrick McLoughlin, junior trade minister, said the government was still
consulting brand owners and producers as well as retail interests, and had
not yet been convinced that the issue should be dealt with through the Trade
Marks Bill, which is now before the Commons.
The bill, which follows a European Union directive rationalising national
laws on trademarks, was given a Commons second reading. It has already been
approved by the Lords.
Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour spokesman on consumer affairs, said the
Consumers' Association had estimated that lookalike products were 20 per
cent to 25 per cent cheaper than branded goods.
Mr Griffiths urged the government to refuse to amend the bill to extend
trademark protection to brand name goods. He said if it did so it would be
pandering to companies with 'near-monopolistic' shares of the market.
Mr Malcolm Bruce, trade and industry spokesman for the Liberal Democrats,
said it would be against the interests of the consumer to provide additional
protection for brand name goods.
Dame Peggy Fenner, Conservative MP for Medway, said there would be
considerable relief that the government had not been persuaded to use the
bill to give added protection to brand-name goods. Recent opinion polls had
shown that 78 per cent of consumers were not confused when choosing between
lookalike products and their brand name rivals.
Sir Dudley Smith, Conservative MP for Warwick and Leamington, called on the
government to give further consideration to what was a 'relatively new
subject'.
The bill, which has been widely welcomed by the CBI and other business
organisations, was given an unopposed second reading.
