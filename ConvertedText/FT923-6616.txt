FT  22 AUG 92 / Property: Empty flats on Millionaires' Row - A look at the
sluggish market for multi-million-pound properties in London's Kensington
and Chelsea


   By MICHAEL HANSON


NOT A single apartment has yet been sold in London's most expensive block of
flats: the discreetly named 3a Palace Green in Kensington Palace Gardens.
This private road, known locally as Millionaires' Row, has the London homes
of the Sultan of Brunei and King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, as well as several
embassies and ambassadors' residences.
Five years ago, when Regalian Properties bought less than an acre of the
former Kensington Barracks site from the Crown Estate for an astonishing
Pounds 21.5m, Prince Charles expressed his displeasure at the prospect of
his home at Kensington Palace being overlooked, so Regalian agreed to lower
the height of its block - not by taking it off the top but by excavating the
foundations another 18 inches.
Since the development was completed last year, these air-conditioned
apartments with their elaborate services and security systems have attracted
interest from around the world, but billionaires have resisted Regalian's
prices, which ranged from Pounds 2m to an unheard-of Pounds 13.5m for the
triplex penthouse on the seventh, eighth and ninth floors, decorated by
David Hicks, with Pounds 1m of contents included.
Now Regalian has instructed its agents Savills (071-499-8644), Hamptons
(071-493-8222) and Sotheby's International Realty (071-408-5196) to cut the
prices of the 20 unsold apartments by as much as 50 per cent, so that they
range from Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 10m. But Regalian's chairman, David
Goldstone, makes no secret of the fact that he would rather sell the whole
development outright to a single investor.
'An American saw the apartments last year and again this summer,' he says.
'He said he would like to buy one, but he had a problem: if Regalian went
under, what would happen to the management? Now he says he is interested in
buying the whole block, and he is a man of considerable wealth.'
A year ago, the price for the whole of 3a Palace Green was Pounds 120m. Now
it is only Pounds 65m - which is still enough to pay off the group's
borrowings. Lack of sales have forced Regalian's share price down so much
this year that the group is worth less than Pounds 6m.
Next to 3a Palace Green is York House, a block of Edwardian mansion flats
recently restored and modernised by a private property company, Taylor
Clark. Two new penthouses added on the top floor were sold last year in
shell form to a single buyer for about Pounds 8m. One modernised
four-bedroom apartment on the sixth floor has just been sold for nearly
Pounds 1m, and another is for sale at Pounds 975,000 by Knight Frank &
Rutley (071-938-4311), which is joint agent with Mellersh & Harding
(071-499-0866) and Cluttons (071-408-1010).
Some of Kensington's largest and most expensive houses are in the Holland
Park area, where a fully-restored ten-bedroom house with an indoor pool was
recently sold for about Pounds 5m. A few doors away, Aylesford
(071-351-2383) has a similar but unrenovated house for sale at Pounds 2.7m.
Knight Frank & Rutley, who recently sold a newly-built six-bedroom house in
Cottesmore Gardens for more than Pounds 2.5m to American Airlines for its
new chairman, say that the price of 31 Phillimore Gardens, a ten-bedroom
house formerly occupied by the Libyan ambassador, has been cut from Pounds
2.95m to Pounds 2m. Best Gapp (071-730-9253) is the joint agent for this
property, which needs total refurbishment.
Another large house in Upper Phillimore Gardens is for sale at Pounds 3.25m
through W A Ellis (071-581-7654) and Knight Frank & Rutley, while a
renovated house in Phillimore Place is for sale at Pounds 1.65m through
Knight Frank & Rutley and Russell Simpson (071-225-0277).
Knight Frank & Rutley's Sloane Street office (071-824-8171) is seeking
offers of Pounds 5m for the only detached double-fronted house in the
Boltons, an enclave of large houses in south west Kensington, where
Beauchamp Estates (071-499-7722) has a slightly smaller house for sale at
Pounds 3.5m. Both properties have been restored and modernised.
Houses in Chelsea are generally smaller than those in Kensington, but not
necessarily cheaper. One of the Grade II listed Georgian terraced houses in
Cheyne Walk (similar to that bought two years ago by Ivana Trump for about
Pounds 2m) is for sale at Pounds 1.95m by Strutt & Parker (071-235-9959).
Kevin Maxwell's house at 31 Jubilee Place, off the King's Road, attracted
little interest at Pounds 1.65m, but when the price was reduced to Pounds
1,425,000 in June it found a buyer through Aylesford at what it says is 'an
acceptable figure.' The double-fronted three-storey house has six bedrooms,
three reception rooms, a secluded garden and a garage.
Overseas investors have paid more than Pounds 2m for the seven apartments in
Atlantic Court, a new residential development at 77 King's Road, Chelsea.
These unidentified clients of Lassmans (071-499-3434) then furnished the
seven apartments above the shops and let them to show a rental return of 8
per cent. Behind Atlantic Court is an award-winning scheme of 51 new houses
known as Charles II Place. When its developers, Harry Neal, went into
receivership in 1990, only 12 houses had been sold. Michael Jordan and Robin
Addy of Cork Gully found Singapore investors willing to pay more than Pounds
14m for the unsold development. These were Parkway Holdings and the
Singapore Warehouse Company, who formed a joint-venture company, Validhill,
which is selling the remaining 39 houses through Savills (071-730-0822) and
Allsop (071-584-6106) from Pounds 360,000 to Pounds 625,000.
Another development that is proving attractive to overseas investors is
Kensington Green, the joint-venture between Taylor Woodrow's Capital and
Mitsui Kensetu (UK) to redevelop St Mary Abbot's Hospital in Marloes Road.
An Italian industrialist has just paid nearly Pounds 1m for one of the
largest houses in the development. Christopher Roupell, of the Kensington
office of Winkworth (071-373-5052), who acted for the Italian buyer, says:
'Now that a change in the exchange control regulations has enabled Italians
to take out money from the country legally, the marketing for Kensington
Green has been very much aimed at the Italian market, and this appears to
have paid off.'
One of Kensington's finest houses failed to attract a buyer when it was
placed on the market in the Spring at Pounds 6m. Lord and Lady Glenconner's
Hill Lodge, one of only two large houses (the other is Aubrey Lodge) set in
their own large grounds on the top of Campden Hill, has had its price cut to
Pounds 4.75m by Aylesford.
The most expensive residential property sold this year has gone to a British
buyer. Crosby Hall, the international hall of residence in Cheyne Walk owned
by the British Federation of University Women, has been bought by
Christopher Moran, the former insurance broker who was expelled from Lloyd's
ten years ago. Crosby Hall contains a 16th-century banqueting hall that was
originally part of Sir John Crosby's remarkable house in Bishopsgate. This
was dismantled and re-erected in Chelsea in 1910, and a four-storey hall of
residence and administrative offices were built alongside.
Moran says he intends to spend Pounds 25m converting Crosby Hall into his
London home, but what he paid for the complex of offices and hall of
residence is not known, because the property was not on the open market.
'I cannot discuss the sale in any way at all,' says Val Considine, company
secretary of Crosby Hall Limited, a subsidiary of BFUW that has been a
private company with charitable status since 1971. However, she does say
that the Charity Commissioners have approved the sale. It is not yet known
how the BFUW founded in 1907 will replace its hall of residence for 90
students who come to Britain from all over the world to follow a recognised
postgraduate course.
