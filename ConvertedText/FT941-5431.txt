FT  07 MAR 94 / ITV may link up with cable groups


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


The ITV companies are considering co-operating with cable television groups
in such areas as acquisition of rights to televise big sporting events.
Mr Nigel Walmsley, the chief executive of Carlton Television, who is acting
as a co-ordinator for ITV's relations with the cable industry, plans to meet
leading operators later this month.
One possibility is a joint bid for the rights to the Five Nations rugby
competition. There could also be talks about sharing World Cup cricket
rights. A consortium of cable television companies recently bought exclusive
rights to show the competition in the UK.
The fact that the talks are taking place at all is an indication that the
cable industry is being taken more seriously by conventional broadcasters
although cable is still limited to not much more than 600,000 homes out of
the total of 21m in the UK that have televisions.
There is already a strong precedent for rivals co-operating in the
television market. The BBC supported British Sky Broadcasting's bid for
English premier league football and shows highlights on Match of the Day.
Both Carlton and London Weekend Television were last year interested in
creating an all-London television channel for the cable companies. In the
end they chose Associated Newspapers, publisher of the Daily Mail, to
provide the channel, which is due to launch later this year.
