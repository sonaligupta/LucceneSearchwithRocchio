FT  30 APR 94 / International Company News: European operations register
turnround


   By KEVIN DONE


Ford's European automotive operations, which have suffered heavy losses for
the past three years, achieved net profits of Dollars 108m (excluding
Jaguar) in the first quarter compared with a profit of Dollars 19m a year
ago, writes Kevin Done.
The company said it was hopeful that its European operations would return to
profit for the whole of the year after running up accumulated losses
(excluding Jaguar) of Dollars 1.53bn in the past three years, including a
loss of Dollars 407m in 1993.
Jaguar, Ford's UK luxury car subsidiary, which has been in loss for the last
five years, suffered a further net operating loss of Dollars 40m in the
first quarter compared with a loss of Dollars 56m in the same period a year
ago.
The return to profit of Ford's mainstream European operations has been
driven by higher productivity and cost-cutting. It has reduced the workforce
of European operations, excluding Jaguar, by 15.4 per cent from 98,100 in
November 1992 to 83,000 by the end of last year.
Overall, west European new car sales fell by 15.4 per cent last year to
11.4m, and the company forecast only 'a slow recovery' in 1994 with car and
truck sales rising by about 3 per cent.
Wholesale vehicle sales from European plants in the first quarter at 428,102
were 1.8 per cent lower than a year ago.
European market share (excluding Jaguar) has risen only marginally in the
first quarter to 11.9 per cent from 11.8 per cent a year ago.
Jaguar increased its sales worldwide by 12 per cent in the first quarter to
7,100 from 6,300 a year ago. Sales increased year-on-year by 25 per cent in
the UK and by 18 per cent in the US, but these rises were offset by falls of
27 per cent in Germany and 21 per cent in Japan.
