FT  21 JUL 94 / British Steel to increase strip and plate prices


   By ANDREW BAXTER


British Steel is raising prices of its strip and plate products in September
and may raise them further at the beginning of next year.
Over the past few days British Steel has told customers that prices for its
strip products - used in the automotive, domestic-appliance and other
industries - will rise by between Pounds 10 and Pounds 15 a tonne from
September 1. This is equivalent to a price rise of 3 per cent to 6 per cent.
Its plate product prices will rise between Pounds 10 and Pounds 20 a tonne,
depending on the grade, from September 3. A Pounds 20 increase would be
equivalent to nearly 10 per cent.
Strip products are made at British Steel's south Wales plants. Steel plates,
which are rolled at Scunthorpe, Humberside and in Scotland, are used in
heavy engineering industries such as shipbuilding.
A series of price rises by British Steel last year caused controversy among
steel users, who complained they were being squeezed between suppliers and
their own customers who refused to pay more.
But British Steel has consistently argued that the rises were necessary to
get an adequate return on investment, and said this week that prices were
still below 1990 levels for both strip and plate products.
The latest increase in strip products is the fifth since April last year,
while that for plates is the first since the middle of last year. British
Steel said the increase in plate prices reflected the strength of recovery
in international plate market sectors, including shipbuilding.
There is also a European-wide shortage of steel slabs, from which plate is
made.
