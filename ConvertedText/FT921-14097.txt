FT  17 JAN 92 / Appointments: Bank swap-shop


NATIONAL WESTMINSTER and TSB Group, a couple of the weaker members of the
British banking establishment, yesterday both changed their chief financial
officers in two highly unusual moves.
John Burns (right) leaves NatWest, his stable for the past 40 years, most
recently as general manager and group chief financial officer, to become
group finance director at TSB. Burns, who is 56, had been a director since
1989. He succeeds Dolf Mootham who retires after the TSB annual general
meeting in March.
The incoming chief financial officer at Nat West is 49-year-old American
Richard Goeltz (far right), previously executive vice-president of the
Seagram company in New York. Goeltz yesterday described his mission at
NatWest as helping it to become a truly global bank in the banking markets
of the 1990s.
While his career has been in the US, he has visited London at least five
times a year for the past two decades.
He also already knows NatWest well from his days as a corporate finance
officer. 'The key thing that has struck me is that all the senior officers
of NatWest have a great team spirit and eagerness to work together,' he
says.
At TSB, which yesterday unveiled its first ever loss over a full year, Burns
is expected to bring sophisticated corporate banking expertise to a
boardroom dominated by marketing people.
It is understood he was attracted by the prospect of wielding very
considerable influence in his new position, possibly second only to that of
chairman Sir Nicholas Goodison.
