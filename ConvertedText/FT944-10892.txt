FT  09 NOV 94 / Economic Watch: Fewer Germans without a job


   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES

West German seasonally adjusted unemployment fell again unexpectedly last
month by 23,000. Although more than 15,000 people left the jobless register
by signing on for government-sponsored job creation or training schemes, the
federal labour office said the jobs market was responding strongly to the
economic recovery. Almost 185,000 vacancies were registered during the
month. The western unadjusted total fell only slightly, leaving the jobless
rate unchanged on the month at 7.9 per cent. In the east, where adjusted
data are not yet available, the rate fell from 13.8 to 13.3 per cent,
reflecting a drop of 40,000 in numbers unemployed. However, a review from
the BHF bank said there were still no grounds for believing that the
continued recovery would lead to substantial cuts in the jobless total.
The Dutch visible trade surplus was around Fl 100m (Pounds 36m) in July,
sharply lower than a revised total of Fl 1.2bn in June, and Fl 1.5bn in July
1993.
Czech industrial output grew by 3 per cent in real terms in September
compared with the same month in 1993, but slowed from August's growth of 7.7
per cent.
Hungary's unemployment rate fell to 10.6 per cent in October from 10.9 in
September, and 12.6 per cent in October 1993.
