FT  12 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris worries over decline in
turnover


   By Our Markets Staff


Bourses rose, but the day was less exciting than it looked, writes Our
Markets Staff.
PARIS added 1.4 per cent with many investors looking ahead to Thursday's
Bundesbank meeting, hoping that this might trigger a further round of
Europe-wide rate cuts. The CAC-40 index put on 30.51 to 2,145.28.
However, professionals were worried by the relative lack of activity as
turnover remained at a modest FFr3bn. UBS said that after average daily
turnover of some FFr8bn in January and FFr6bn in February, the figure had
shrunk to a daily average of FFr4.7bn last month. The Swiss bank noted an
absence of foreign investors and a steady stream of rights issues, inflated
last week by Cap Gemini Sogeti and Cerus and with further additions expected
soon from Euro Disney and Eurotunnel.
Peugeot climbed FFr21 or 2.4 per cent to FFr895, as brokers revised their
estimates upwards. Kleinwort Benson, which recently issued a buy note,
forecast outperformance based on success with new models and benefits
arising from restructuring measures.
FRANKFURT fed on the global switch to cyclicals, Daimler leading the market
up with a DM17 rise to DM878 as the Dax index rose 21.99 to 2,225.33.
Turnover eased from DM10.2bn to DM9.6bn. Daimler led the active stocks list
in DM1.3bn after Der Spiegel said over the weekend that group net profits
would fall from DM1.45bn to DM615m in 1993.
Among the less fashionable financials, however, Commerzbank fell DM1.50 to
DM362.00 after it said that group net profits dropped in 1993. The bank
raised its dividend, but also announced a DM400m capital increase.
Back among the cyclicals, Siemens closed the session up DM10.30 at DM731.30,
benefiting from its recent underperformance. Thyssen jumped DM6.30 to
DM280.00 and Mannesmann by DM10 to DM441.50 on a large buy order.
MILAN extended its post election rally, the Comit index rising another 19.25
or 2.5 per cent to 775.88.
Fiat remained at the centre of attention, adding L420 or 6.7 per cent to
L6,630, for a cumulative 18.3 per cent rise since Easter. Yesterday,
speculation mounted that the new government might introduce tax incentives
to boost car sales, like those recently announced by the Spanish and French
governments. But Mr Nicholas Potter at Credito Italiano International
commented that while the idea of such incentives was sound, it was not
compelling given the other commitments awaiting the new administration.
Pirelli surged L168 or 5.6 per cent to L3,159, off a day's high of L3,270,
after reports that it was joining forces with Alcatel Alsthom to buy a joint
stake in Stet which is slated for privatisation later this year.
ZURICH saw profit-taking but the SMI index still finished 10.6 higher at
2,884.0.
The market was driven by heavy demand for UBS, SFr10 higher at SFr1,268, but
elsewhere, the financial sector was mixed. Zurich Insurance bearers fell
SFr23 to SFr1,330 while Swiss Re, supported by a buy recommendation from
Credit Suisse, rose SFr12 to SFr630.
Nestle, a target of renewed US institutional buying, added SFr18 to
SFr1,234.
Investors gave a mixed response to first quarter sales figures from Roche.
While a 12 per cent rise in local currency terms was seen as satisfactory,
there was disappointment that this translated into a rise of just 6 per cent
in Swiss francs. The certificates gave up an early SFr45 advance to end
unchanged at SFr7,150.
AMSTERDAM was motivated by impressive rises in the internationals as the AEX
index rose another 7.12, or 1.7 per cent to 422.71. Royal Dutch recorded its
fourth successive gain as more foreign investors entered as buyers. The
shares advanced Fl 3.60 to Fl 204.40.
Unilever, up Fl 5.40 to Fl 204.70, was another good performer as the company
reiterated its commitment to brand products, an area which has come up
against increasing pressure recently from unbranded products.
Ahold was one of the few stocks to go against the trend, losing 40 cents to
Fl 48.60, after denying reports that its domestic supermarket chain had been
losing market share in the first months of 1994.
WARSAW tumbled another 10.7 per cent as investors, shaken by last week's
falls, continued to sell. The WIG index fell 1,436.7 to 11,959.7, down by
42.4 per cent since its peak on March 8.
