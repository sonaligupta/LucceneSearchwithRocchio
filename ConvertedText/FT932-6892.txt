FT  26 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Anglo American edges RTZ to win
Brazil copper deposit stake


   By KENNETH GOODING

A TUSSLE between the world's two biggest mining companies, RTZ Corporation
of the UK and Anglo American Corporation of South Africa, for a stake in a
world-class copper project in Brazil has been won by Anglo.
The copper deposit, at Salobo in the Carajas region of the Amazon, is owned
by Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD), Brazil's biggest state-controlled
mining group.
The project, which is expected to cost Dollars 750m, is very important for
Brazil, which at present has to import much of its copper requirements.
Anglo, acting through its Brazilian affiliate, Moro Velho, won the joint
venture race by offering CVRD better terms. Unlike RTZ, it was not insisting
on a majority stake and operational control. Anglo and CVRD will start a
feasibility study which is expected to result in the partners moving ahead
to develop a mine producing 150.000 tonnes a year of copper and 8,000 tonnes
of gold. They hope to complete the study in one year and then to get the
mine into production in another three years.
The Salobo deposit was discovered in 1976. Since then, CVRD has spent
Dollars 120m on it.
CVRD already has established that the ore body consists of at least 700m
tonnes containing 0.7 per cent copper and 0.5 grams of gold a tonnes, with
more ore to be discovered.
Development has been held back because of its unusual ore. It has to be
ground into a very fine powder because the copper is disseminated through
it.
RTZ is continuing talks with CVRD about the possibility of some form of
joint venture associated with nickel deposits owned by the two groups.
Mr Antonio Netto, technical director of RTZ Minercao, the UK group's holding
company in Brazil, said its nickel project at Fortaleza das Minas in Minas
Gerais state is very high grade, with two per cent nickel and 0.5 per cent
copper a tonne. But the reserve of 7-8m tonnes is not enough to support
investment in a concentrator, smelter and refinery, which are needed because
Brazil has none.
CVRD has a nickel deposit in Carajas and it might be possible for the two
groups to share a nickel refinery in Brazil.
