FT  02 NOV 93 / International Company News: Placer Dome sharply lower in
third quarter

LOWER gold output and lower average prices for gold and copper depressed
profits of Placer Dome, the Canadian international mining group, in the
third quarter and first nine months of 1993.
Third-quarter profit was USDollars 13m, or 6 cents a share, down sharply
from Dollars 33m, or 14 cents, a year earlier, on revenues of Dollars 229m,
against Dollars 264m, including investment income of Dollars 10m, against
Dollars 20m.
For the first nine months of the year, profit was Dollars 45m, or 19 cents a
share, against Dollars 68m, or 29 cents, on revenues of Dollars 699m,
against Dollars 834m. Both periods include special items.
Gold output was 450,000 oz in the third quarter, down from 508,000 oz and in
the nine months 1,354,000 oz, a decline 8 per cent from 1,473,000 oz a year
earlier.
Cash production cost in the nine months was Dollars 189 per oz, compared
with Dollars 192 in the same period last year, while the average realised
price of gold in the nine months was Dollars 376 oz, slightly above the
average market price.
Gold output declined due to lower grades and a reduced stake in the big
Porgera mine in New Guinea and the sale of several mining interests. Eight
of Placer's 13 producing mines reduced their cash costs.
