FT  13 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Not all are united on EU (1)


   From Mr WILLIAM CASH MP


Sir, In your leader, 'Europe by any other name' (November 11), you indicate
that the question of what the new institutions for Europe should be called
is a 'small matter', even 'legalistic'. You grandly decide to cut through
the Gordian Knot and ignore the legal framework, not to mention the European
Community, and (no doubt to the delight of the federalists and
Euro-propagandists) opt to adopt the expression 'European Union' as the
institutional nomenclature for Europe.
Repeatedly we were told in the House of Commons this past year that the EC
and the EU are entirely distinct and that the great victory for the
government at Maastricht was that we had negotiated the inter-government
pillars of the EU. Euro-realists were vilified for daring to suggest that
this was a Pyrrhic victory. Your leader has proved our point.
