FT  03 AUG 92 / Observer: Odd characters


Poor literacy is a problem the world over. But China, where the authorities
have just also ordered a crackdown on basics such as spelling, might seem to
have special difficulties.
In English-speaking nations, for instance, the problem usually results in
nothing worse than puzzling new words (an 'enjuiced' pregnancy, for example)
which, with a bit of thought, can be decoded from the context. The
equivalent in China, however, is the distortion not just of words but the
individual characters.
Fortunately, Observer's checks reveal that literate Chinese can still work
out the intended meaning, even if - as one translator said - 'it's sometimes
like looking at a bit of finished knitting and divining what should have
been in the pattern'.
As a by-product of the checks, too, there's news for the innumerable public
speakers on management who're forevertelling their audiences that the
Chinese word for 'crisis' is formed by linking together the characters for
'danger' and for 'opportunity'. It is true.
