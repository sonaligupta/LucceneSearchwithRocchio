FT  15 DEC 94 / International Company News: NEC, Fujitsu to replace faulty
Pentium chips

NEC, Japan's dominant personal computer supplier, and Fujitsu, its largest
computer manufacturer, have agreed to replace faulty Intel Pentium
microprocessors free of charge, writes Alan Cane in London. Some 150,000
Pentium-based machines have been sold in Japan to date.
Their decision comes as Intel, the world's largest semiconductor
manufacturer, and International Business Machines (IBM), argue over who
should bear the cost of replacing the faulty part which can cause
mathematical errors in certain conditions. NEC said it believed it had a
social responsibility to replace the flawed microprocessor.
IBM has already stopped shipping Pentium-based computers and has said it
will replace the faulty chip in the 100,000 Pentium machines it has shipped
so far. It will not, however, pay for labour costs involved.
NEC said its research showed the probability of the error in calculations
was very low.
