FT  13 APR 92 / Letter: Defining directors


   From Mr JOHN CHEELE


Sir, Re Mr Bob Garratt's letter (April 8), if we are moved to have our
corporations directed by boards of professional governors rather than of
promoted operational managers, and are still not prepared to adopt 'twin
boards', then we need clearly to define and separate the often incompatible
roles of governing and managing.
Perhaps we could now consider clear role separation by adopting a convention
that a significant majority of a board's members cannot also be employees of
their company - moving towards the upper, non-executive tier of twin boards,
but preserving scope for companies to evolve their own specific board
structures.
