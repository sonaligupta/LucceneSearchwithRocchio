FT  10 JAN 92 / White House seeks health care overhaul


   By GEORGE GRAHAM


   WASHINGTON


WHITE House officials have proposed to medical and employer groups measures
for overhauling the US health care system. This is part of an attempt to
produce a reform package before President George Bush's State of the Union
address on January 28.
Mr Samuel Skinner, White House chief of staff, has met the American Medical
Association to discuss ideas in the president's health care proposals. They
include a refundable tax credit to help families pay health insurance
premiums, and incentives for people covered by the federal Medicare and
Medicaid systems to join more cost-effective managed care plans.
However, some analysts believe that managed care programmes, such as Health
Maintenance Organisations, produce a one-off gain when people join, but no
long-term curb on the 10 per cent a year increase in medical costs. The
administration also wants to restrict malpractice lawsuits so as to control
the rise in the insurance premiums that doctors must pay in case of
malpractice suits.
Other proposals include higher premiums from high-income families for
Medicare, the federal health programme for the retired. Medical costs in the
US have risen by more than 10 per cent a year for the last five years, to
total an estimated Dollars 817bn (Pounds 449bn) this year. Yet, more than
34m people have no medical insurance.
The administration's proposals still fall well short of several broad,
controversial reform packages proposed by the Democrats. These include a
'play or pay' scheme where employers would have to choose between providing
health insurance to their employees and paying a tax to fund an expanded
Medicaid.
