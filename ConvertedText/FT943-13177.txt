FT  21 JUL 94 / International Company News: AGF confirms bank stake plans

   PARIS


Assurances Generales de France (AGF), the insurance company scheduled for
privatisation in autumn, yesterday confirmed it was considering the sale of
its 43 per cent stake in Banque Francaise du Commerce Exterieur (BFCE), the
specialist banking group.
AGF also verified that it was in talks with Credit Lyonnais, the troubled
French banking group that owns 24 per cent of BFCE, over the proposed
disposal. However, AGF and Credit Lyonnais declined to comment on
speculation that they were considering selling their holdings together as a
controlling stake.
The disposal of their combined holdings, a majority stake of 67 per cent
with an estimated value of FFr2.8bn (Dollars 534m), would in theory raise
more money than the separate sales of the individual stakes, given that a
potential purchaser could be expected to pay a premium for control of BFCE.
