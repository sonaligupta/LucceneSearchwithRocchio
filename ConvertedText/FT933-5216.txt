FT  04 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Molynx returns to black with Pounds 21,000


Molynx Holdings returned to profit in the first half of 1993 but the result
continued to be disappointing, according to Mr Eric Walters, chairman.
Pre-tax profit came to Pounds 21,000. Although less than half of the
comparative Pounds 45,000, it compared with a loss of Pounds 531,000 in the
second half of 1992.
Mr Walters said the closed circuit television and security division
performed significantly better than in 1992. However, the recovery had so
far eluded the markets in which the building energy management division
operated.
CCTV sales rose to Pounds 6.18m (Pounds 4.9m) and trading profit to Pounds
698,000 (Pounds 221,000). There was recovery in the UK and strong growth in
Norway, but recession in other European markets dampened the outcome.
At BEMS, turnover increased to Pounds 6.9m (Pounds 6.2m) but the loss jumped
to Pounds 438,000 (Pounds 24,000). In the UK sales moved up 23 per cent with
Synchronised Systems having the benefit of the good order book from three
contracts started in 1992.
Mr Walters said 'unacceptably high' operating losses continued in Germany
and the US. Sales in Germany slumped 62 per cent and a return to profit was
not expected until 1994. It was hoped to be in the black in the US by the
year end.
Earnings per share were nil (0.2p). There is no interim dividend, against
1.3p, the total for 1992.
