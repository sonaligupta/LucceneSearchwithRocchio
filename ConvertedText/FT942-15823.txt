FT  13 APR 94 / International Company News: SAS sells card unit in
refocusing operation

Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) took its corporate refocusing programme a
step further yesterday when it announced the sale of Diners Club Nordic, a
credit and charge card operation, to Skandinaviska Enskilda Bank, Sweden's
leading commercial bank.
SAS said the transaction would produce a capital gain of between SKr100m
(Dollars 12.84m) and SKr200m and reduce its balance sheet by SKr2.2bn. Exact
terms were not disclosed.
Diners Club Nordic has 395,000 cardholders in Denmark, Norway, Sweden and
Finland. The operation, bought by SAS in 1986, recorded pre-tax profits of
SKr49m last year, up from SKr30m a year earlier. Operating revenue climbed
18 per cent to SKr517m. The unit's book value at the year-end was around
SKr160m.
SAS wants to concentrate on core air transport operations after four years
of losses and a failed pan-European merger with three other airlines.
The strategy has led to the sale of its stake in LanChile, the Chilean
airline, and an aircraft sale and leaseback deal. Further moves are planned,
including the disposal of SAS Leisure Group, Scandinavia's leading tour
operator, and SAS Service Partner.
SE-Banken said it wanted to strengthen its position in the credit and card
charge market.
