FT  16 JAN 92 / Pools side helps Zetters to pounds 450,000


Zetters Group reported a 21 per cent expansion in pre-tax profits for the
six months to September 30 1991.
The increase - from pounds 372,111 to pounds 451,010 - was achieved in spite
of a fall in turnover from pounds 11.4m to pounds 11m.
The pools operation maintained turnover, directors said, with tight control
over operating costs helping to lift profits.
In contrast, turnover in the competitions and marketing side dived from
pounds 680,051 to pounds 231,655 reflecting the end of the News
International Lotto competition which ceased in June of last year.
Nevertheless, profitability of the Spotting the Ball competition was being
maintained.
Earnings per share were at 4.1p (3.4p), and, in a move to reduce disparity,
the interim dividend is lifted to 4p (1.75p).
