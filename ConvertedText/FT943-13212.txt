FT  21 JUL 94 / Observer: Unreal hopes


Why are politicians unable to resist piggy-backing on the success of
national sporting heroes? Argentine president Carlos Menem's designation of
Diego Maradona as a 'roving ambassador' after the 1990 Rome football World
Cup now looks risible.
Brazil's government is now doing its damnedest to repeat the error, by
connecting the Brazilian team's success in the US World Cup to hopes that
the country's new Real currency will also struggle through to eventual
victory.
Don't bank on it.
For the thousands of Braslia residents who cheered their returning soccer
stars at the capital's airport late on Tuesday immediately started booing
when three government ministers stepped on to the runway. Looks like a
penalty for someone.
