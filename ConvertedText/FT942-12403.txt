FT  29 APR 94 / UK Company News: Stanhope cuts loss and sees further advance


   By SIMON DAVIES


Stanhope Properties, the development and investment company which jointly
owns the Broadgate development, announced lower interim losses of Pounds
9.3m, against Pounds 15.4m. Turnover for the six months to December 31 fell
from Pounds 27.5m to Pounds 17.1m.
At the end of the period negative net worth stood at Pounds 15m but Mr
Stuart Lipton, chief executive, said he was confident Stanhope would achieve
a positive value by the June 30 year end.
However, the company remains under pressure to proceed with the refinancing
of its Pounds 130m of debt, after incurring losses of Pounds 277m in the two
previous fiscal years.
Mr Lipton said Stanhope was talking to a number of groups over refinancing
proposals, which might include the sale of Broadgate or equity financing. An
agreement would be reached before the end of the year, he said.
One of the companies involved in the talks is British Land, which on
Wednesday completed its purchase of a 29.9 per cent stake in Stanhope.
The purchase is being disputed by Stanhope, as breaching pre-emption rights
agreed with Olympia & York, the collapsed Canadian property group, whose
stake was sold via its bankers, the Bank of Nova Scotia.
Mr John Ritblat, British Land chairman, said yesterday: 'We bought the
shares because they were offered to us, and because we thought it would be
of mutual advantage.
'Stanhope has done rather well, because the share price has almost doubled
and it has encouraged interest in the property.'
Broadgate Properties, contributed an operating surplus of Pounds 500,000,
compared with losses of Pounds 4.9m, which was the main factor behind an
improvement in the share of losses of associates of Pounds 1.22m (Pounds
6.46m). However, the 1994 figure was helped by the capitalisation of Pounds
10m of interest costs.
Broadgate is now 96 per cent let. In addition, a further 215,000 sq ft of
the Ludgate development has been let, leaving it 34 per cent vacant.
Stanhope's net interest payments fell to Pounds 6.1m (Pounds 11.6m), because
of the proceeds from property sales.
The company has obtained planning consent for a 1,000 acre development near
Cambridge in a joint venture with Alfred McAlpine. It will comprise 3,000
houses, a business park and a retail centre.
