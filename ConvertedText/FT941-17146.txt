FT  06 JAN 94 / Irish group wins duty-free deal


Aer Rianta, the state-backed company which runs Ireland's main airports, has
won the contract to run duty-free shops at both ends of the Channel tunnel.
Duty-free sales are expected to account for most non-travel revenues from
Eurotunnel's operations. They are estimated at Pounds 18m this year, rising
to Pounds 46m in 1996.
Mr Derek Keogh, chief executive, said Aer Rianta had fought off strong
international competition to win the deal. Its shops will cover an area of
400 sq m at each end of the tunnel.
