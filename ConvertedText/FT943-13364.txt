FT  20 JUL 94 / Merseyside body lifts performance


The controversial Merseyside Development Corporation yesterday told MPs it
had met or exceeded all government targets set for it in the year to the end
of March.
The Liverpool-based corporation has been under fire from the Commons public
accounts committee over losses of nearly Pounds 700,000 on an opera concert
staged to celebrate a tall ships regatta in 1992.
The corporation's annual report says it has reclaimed 47 acres of land in
the last year, built nearly five miles of new roads and 402 houses,
developed more than 750,000 sq ft of commercial floor space, secured 2,753
jobs and attracted Pounds 37m of private-sector investment.
