FT  23 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: British Land issues Pounds
200m debenture


   By SARA WEBB


BRITISH LAND, the UK property company, issued Pounds 200m of 35-year
debenture stock yesterday. The funds will be used for general corporate
purposes, which could include the repayment of the group's more expensive
debt, the acquisition of new properties, or further capital expenditure on
existing properties.
The Pounds 200m First Mortgage Debenture Stock 2028 has a 9 3/8 per cent
coupon and was issued at a spread of 90 basis points over the 8 3/4 per cent
gilt due 2017, with an issue price of 99.403. By late afternoon, the bid
price was 99.5, while the spread was unchanged, according to SG Warburg
Securities, joint lead manager for the deal with NatWest Capital Markets.
The 35-year debenture increases the weighted average maturity of BL's
outstanding debt to about 16 years.
