FT  13 MAR 92 / Mafia assassinates Euro MP


   By ROBERT GRAHAM


THE assassination in Palermo yesterday of Mr Salvatore Lima, a prominent
Christian Democrat politician and European member of parliament, brought
Mafia violence to the forefront of the campaign for Italy's general
elections on April 5.
He was gunned down inside his car by two men on a motorcycle near his home
on the outskirts of Palermo in a well prepared operation. His driver was
slightly injured by glass and another passenger was unhurt.
His killing followed the murder on Wednesday at Castellmare di Sabbia, near
Naples, of Mr Sebastian Corrado, a leading local councillor belonging to the
Party of the Democrat Left (PDS) who had denounced activities of the Naples
camorra. In another development, police yesterday found the body of Mr
Luciano Carugo, a Milan businessmen with large construction interests who
had disappeared two days ago.
Mr Lima, three times elected to the Italian parliament, was a former mayor
of Palermo and on the national executive of the Christian Democrat Party. He
was the second Christian Democrat mayor of Palermo to have been murdered
since 1984. The anti-Mafia commission in Sicily issued a statement saying:
'The fact that this happened three weeks before the elections suggests that
the killing was an attempt to influence the election campaign."
Mr Lima was a controversial figure.
On at least four occasions parliamentary commissions in the 1970s had
unsuccessfully attempted to investigate his connections with the
construction business while he was in the Palermo municipal administration.
Italian politicians universally condemned his killing yesterday, but several
reactions were cautious.
'Faced with the killing of such a controversial political figure, I can only
express human sympathy,' said Mr Giorgio La Malfa, leader of the Republican
Party.
