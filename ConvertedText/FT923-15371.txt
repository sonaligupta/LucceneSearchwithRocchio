FT  02 JUL 92 / The Royal Mint


THE Royal Mint wishes to clarify that it is issuing 2,500 gold proof 50p
pieces commemorating the UK's presidency of the EC and 35,000 sterling
silver versions of the same coin. As the result of an agency error, the
figures contained in an FT report of June 30 were wrong.
