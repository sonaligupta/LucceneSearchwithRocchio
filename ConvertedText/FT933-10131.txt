FT  05 AUG 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool


After an encouraging opening day to the new selling season last week, prices
barely held steady, and ended only a fraction higher than at the close of
the 1992/93 season. This week has seen the market slip further, despite
reduced offerings in Melbourne due to a strike of laboratory technicians.
The resumed easier tendency, after some improvement in the previous three
months, is not helpful to business in related markets. The Australian market
indicator on August 4 was 439c/kg, down 16 cents compared with a week ago.
