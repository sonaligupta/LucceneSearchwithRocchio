FT  05 AUG 93 / Letter: Short contracts and 'hire and fire' mentality behind
job anxiety


   From Mr PATRICK DENNIS


Sir, Rachel Johnson's article, 'Theories behind feel-bad factor' (August 2),
omitted several important reasons why people are still increasingly anxious
about losing their jobs - in particular compared with the previous economic
cycle.
The rising trend towards short-term contracts, part-time (especially female)
employment and the development of a 'hire and fire' mentality among
employers have been crucial. Also relevant would be the more even
distribution of unemployment, both geographically and occupationally.
Moreover, employment is still falling, despite the recent falls in
unemployment. This is a consequence not only of the reduced numbers of those
of school-leaving age, but also of school leavers and women being
discouraged from entering the labour market. When many women lose their
jobs, they do not qualify for unemployment benefits so are not registered as
unemployed.
Is it not time the UK started to put increasing emphasis on employment
figures, as they do in the US, rather than exclusively on unemployment
figures? Finally, it is worth noting that the greater fear of unemployment
is an important reason why average annual earnings growth has fallen to just
3.75 per cent, compared with 7 per cent in the previous economic cycle.
