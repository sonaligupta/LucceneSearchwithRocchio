FT  23 APR 93 / International Company News: Data General turns in an
unexpected loss


   By LOUISE KEHOE


DATA GENERAL, the US minicomputer manufacturer, reported unexpected losses
for the second quarter as its struggle to achieve sustained profitability
faltered, despite increased sales of its new open systems products.
Net losses for the quarter were Dollars 7.6m, or 22 cents per share,
compared with losses of Dollars 55.3m, or Dollars 1.69, in the same period
last year when the company took a restructuring charge of Dollars 48m.
Revenues were Dollars 267.4m, against Dollars 273.8m. The company said that,
without the unfavourable impact of foreign exchange rate changes, revenue
would have been slightly higher than last year.
'We are not satisfied with the overall results, primarily in the revenue
area,' said Mr Ronald Skates, president and chief executive, 'but we are
encouraged by the continued success of our open systems computers.'
