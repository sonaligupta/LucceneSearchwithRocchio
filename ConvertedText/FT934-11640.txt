FT  30 OCT 93 / Individuals increase company holdings


   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent


THE PROPORTION of the total shareholding in UK companies owned by
individuals has increased since the late 1980s, partly due to a rash of
privatisation issues which have been aimed at members of the public.
At the end of last year individuals owned 21.3 per cent of the share capital
in UK companies, up from 20.6 per cent in 1989.
Pension funds held the biggest stake in public companies registered on the
London Stock Exchange, accounting for 34.7 per cent of total share capital
valued at Pounds 620.6bn. In 1989 the stake held by pension funds was
slightly lower at 30.5 per cent.
According to an article in the latest edition of Economic Trends, published
by the Central Statistical Office, the shareholding owned by insurance
companies has decreased over the same period to 16.5 per cent from 18.5 per
cent.
Almost two thirds of the value of shares held by individuals at the end of
December were in blocks of less than Pounds 100,000, and more than one
quarter in holdings of less than Pounds 5,000.
Individuals owned 24.5 per cent of shares in privatised companies, a higher
figure than the proportion for the market as a whole.
Overseas residents owned 12.1 per cent of total shares, worth about Pounds
75bn at the end of last year.
People and organisations in the United States accounted for just under 50
per cent of overseas investment, while other European Community nations
accounted for 17.5 per cent.
