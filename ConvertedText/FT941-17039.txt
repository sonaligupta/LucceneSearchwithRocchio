FT  06 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Sidney C Banks shares respond to profits
leap


Shares of Sidney C Banks, the Bedfordshire-based grain and agricultural
specialist, yesterday rose 28p to 248p on news of a 35 per cent improvement
in pre-tax profits to Pounds 2.06m for the half year to October 31.
The advance, from last time's Pounds 1.53m, reflected the full benefit of
marketing stocks and grains held over at the end of the previous financial
year.
Turnover slipped to Pounds 114.3m (Pounds 119.2m) due to reduced volume from
the 1993 harvest and lower grain prices.
The interim dividend is lifted from 3p to 3.5p from earnings of 15.6p
(12.4p) per share.
Mr John Burr, who yesterday stepped down as chairman, said all divisions of
the group were operating profitably while market share had been increased
and margins maintained.
He was succeeded as chairman by Mr Alistair Mitchell-Innes, former chief
executive of Isosceles and deputy chairman of HP Bulmer.
For the 1992-93 year the group benefited from the integration of
acquisitions and reduced interest charges and achieved a rise in pre-tax
profits from Pounds 2.29m to Pounds 2.87m.
