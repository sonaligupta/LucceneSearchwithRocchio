FT  30 NOV 94 / International Company News: Macquarie Bank in talks on share
issue

Macquarie Bank, the Sydney-based investment bank in which Hill Samuel of the
UK is the largest minority shareholder, is in discussions with shareholders
over a possible stock market flotation. A decision will be taken next year.
'We are in the process of discussions with a number of our shareholders but
no decision has yet been made,' said Mr David Clarke, chairman, in Melbourne
yesterday. The bank is owned by more than 40 institutions, although
management and staff also have a significant minority interest.
Mr Clarke's comments came as Macquarie unveiled a sharp drop in profits
before tax for the six months to end-September to ADollars 34.5m (USDollars
26.3m) from ADollars 43.5m. A significantly lower tax charge of ADollars
1.3m against ADollars 12.3m left after-tax profits at ADollars 33.2m, up
from ADollars 31.2m in the same period of 1993 - 94.
Macquarie said the fall in pre-tax profits was due to the tougher conditions
faced by its securities businesses - declining prices, less volatility and
smaller trading volumes. It said the operations remained in the black but
profits were modest.
Elsewhere, the bank said that there were 'strong earnings contributions'
from the non-securities businesses. In the corporate banking group, loan
loss provisions were negligible, and offset by write-backs of previous loan
losses.
