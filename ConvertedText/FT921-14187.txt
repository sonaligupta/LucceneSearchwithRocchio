FT  17 JAN 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Notebooks for heavyweights


   By PAUL TAYLOR


NEW portable and notebook PCs continue to roll off the production lines
packing even more power into the clam-shell box, writes Paul Taylor.
Now Toshiba has added to the top end of its range with the T6400DX and
T6400SX models built around Intel's 80484DX and 80486SX chips. The machines
are aimed at engineers and scientists who need heavyweight computing power.
The mains-powered portables, with thin film technology colour or monochrome
gas-plasma screens, boast 16-bit card expansion slots, memory expansion up
to 20Mbytes using credit card-sized memory cards and full-sized 102-key
detachable keyboards.
Toshiba has also introduced the mid-range T3300SL notebook driven by a
power-saving 25MHz Intel 80386SL chip and using nickel hydride batteries
which offer a third more power than their nickel cadmium equivalents. An
internal modem which can be plugged into a cellular telephone is also
available.
