FT  13 NOV 92 / Final Iraq export case dropped


   By JOHN MASON


THE CUSTOMS and Excise Department yesterday abandoned its final Iraq-export
prosecution in the wake of the Matrix Churchill affair - dropping its case
against Mr Keith Bailey, chairman of BSA Tools of Birmingham.
Mr Bailey had been facing a single charge of evading export controls in
selling machine tools to Iraq between September 1988 and March 1989.
Mr Allan Moses QC, who also prosecuted in the Matrix Churchill case, told an
Old Bailey judge that after considering the evidence from that trial he was
of the firm view that the only proper course was to abandon proceedings
against Mr Bailey. A formal Not Guilty verdict was returned by the judge, Mr
Justice Garland. Mr Bailey's costs were awarded from public funds.
Mr Bailey, as chairman of the Machine Tools Trade Association, attended the
meeting at which Mr Alan Clark, then trade minister, advised Mr Paul
Henderson, one of the Matrix Churchill defendants, to stress the peaceful
applications of machine tools when applying for export licences.
Mr Clark later admitted to the Matrix Churchill trial that this involved
being 'economical with the actualite'. Mr Bailey confirmed that, if his
trial had gone ahead, he would have called Mr Clark as a witness.
Mr Bailey said afterwards that the prosecution had damaged his business. He
also defended the government's role in the affair. 'I think they wanted to
be in Iraq at the start of reconstruction following the war with Iran,' he
explained.
'Like every other country they had to be there at the beginning if they were
to be there at all. Iraq . . . was obviously going to be a major trading
partner.'
Mr Bailey said the issue of compensation would be difficult because BSA
Tools had to work closely with the government regularly.
