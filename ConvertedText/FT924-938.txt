FT  21 DEC 92 / Honda and Isuzu to sell each other's vehicles

HONDA Motor and Isuzu Motor, the Japanese carmakers, have agreed to sell
each other's vehicles following Isuzu's decision last week to halt
production of passenger cars.
The agreement marks another step in the consolidation of the Japanese car
industry, which is struggling under a burden of vast excess production
capacity.
Under the agreement, dealers of each company will be able to offer a broader
range of vehicles to their customers, while providing expanded sales outlets
for each company.
The agreement also remedies an important strategic weakness of Honda, which
had nothing to offer in the area of recreational vehicles, one of the few
growing areas of the car market in North America.
Honda is to sell the Isuzu Rodeo, a recreational vehicle, under its own
label in North America. Honda has long talked about offering recreational
vehicles to its customers, but balked at the cost and time needed to develop
a suitable product in an area where it had no experience.
The vehicles are produced in Indiana, in the US.
Isuzu, for its part, will begin to market Honda's small passenger cars under
its own label in Japan as it phases out production of its own cars. Isuzu
will also halt the supply of small cars to General Motors, which owns a 37
per cent stake in the company.
Isuzu has operated in the red for the past two years.
