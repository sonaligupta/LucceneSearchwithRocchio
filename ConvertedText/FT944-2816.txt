FT  15 DEC 94 / World Trade News: US probe into EU banana trade

The US trade representative is investigating complaints from US banana
producers that the European Union import regime, which favours banana
suppliers in the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group of countries, is
discriminatory.
Washington will hold talks with several Caribbean banana exporters in
January over preferential access to the European market. 'The US trade
representative has told us that the investigation will focus on the trade
practices of the EU, and is not directed against the Caribbean exporters,'
said Mr John Compton, the prime minister of St Lucia, the leading exporter
in the Windward Islands. The investigation followed complaints from Chiquita
Brands International, a US company producing bananas in Latin America, and
the Hawaiian Banana Industry Association.
The charge was filed under Section 301 of the US trade act, and was
supported by claims that the EU's import regime, implemented in July 1993,
discriminated against fruit from Latin America. The import regime gives
special access to exporters in the ACP group, about 70 former European
colonies which have a trade treaty with the EU.
In a reversal of policy, the US government said last week that it will not
object to a General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade waiver for the Lome
Convention, the trade and aid treaty between the EU and the ACP countries.
This has reduced the threat to the ACP's preferential access to the EU
market.
Officials from other Caribbean exporting countries said that the US trade
representative's statement allowed the region's producers to 'buy some time'
but that the danger to the preferential EU market had not been removed.
The Caribbean Community (Caricom) said the investigation posed a threat to
the Caribbean industry on which many island economies depend.
