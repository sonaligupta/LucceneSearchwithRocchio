FT  23 JUL 93 / Car output at three-year high but commercial sector
depressed


   By JOHN GRIFFITHS


CAR OUTPUT in June was the highest for a single month for nearly three
years, and the highest for the month of June for 19 years, according to
figures published yesterday.
Yet the statistics also underlined that recovery has yet to work its way
into all sectors of commercial vehicle production, where output last month
and in the first half of the year remained sharply below even the severely
depressed levels of last year.
The UK car industry's performance is in stark contrast to that of the main
Continental car-producing countries - Germany, France, Spain and Italy -
where output has been falling by up to 30 per cent since the beginning of
this year.
The statistics, issued jointly by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders and the Central Statistical Office, also sound a note of caution
about the rate at which the car industry may be able to sustain growth in
output.
Production for export last month slipped below the equivalent period last
year for the second time this year, indicating that the depressed state of
Continental markets - where sales have been falling more sharply than output
 -may soon start to inhibit growth in output.
Last month's 4.3 per cent increase in car output, to 134,753 from 129,203 in
June last year, was to cater almost entirely for the annual surge in sales
in August when the new registration prefix 'L' is introduced.
From a record of just over 500,000 in 1989, August sales fell to 367,000 in
1991 and recovered only marginally to 374,000 last year.
There is growing confidence in the industry that they will rise above the
400,000 thresh-old once again next month.
Total car output for the first half of the year was 742,991, a rise of 8.19
per cent on the 686,747 of the period last year. Output for export over the
period was 7.11 per cent higher at 287,484 from 268,412.
The UK manufacturing plants of Nissan, Toyota and Honda are almost entirely
responsible for the increase in car output. Statistics on output by
manufacturer, also made available yesterday, cover only the first five
months of the year. They show Nissan's output up 43 per cent, to 115,244,
and Toyota and Honda - each in production for the first time this year -
producing 9,727 and 10,886 units respectively.
In the same period Rover Group's output was 3 per cent lower at 163,229,
Ford's 12.3 per cent lower at 131,836 and Vauxhall's 5.2 per cent lower at
111,852.
The depressed state of the commercial vehicle industry is reflected in
first-half output of 105,711 - a drop of 23.91 per cent on the same period
last year.
Export production in the period was 50,419 - a dip of 34.72 per cent on last
year's figure. The fall in June itself was a precipitous 39.2 per cent, to
16,683 from 27,437.
However, both sets of figures reflect the interruption of output caused by
the two-month receivership at van and truck maker Leyland Daf.
