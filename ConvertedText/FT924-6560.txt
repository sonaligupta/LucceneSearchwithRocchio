FT  20 NOV 92 / International Company News: Malaysian carrier ahead 5.5%

   KUALA LUMPUR


MALAYSIA Airlines (MAS), the country's national carrier, has announced a 5.5
per cent rise in pre-tax profits for the first half to September 30.
Taxable profits rose to MDollars 153.46m (USDollars 61.2m) from MDollars
145.68m a year earlier. Turnover increased to MDollars 1.94bn from MDollars
1.78bn.
In the year to March 1991, MAS registered pre-tax profits of MDollars 206m
and MDollars 120m in 1991-92. But these figures included funds raised from
aircraft sales. The group did not reveal what percentage of interim profits
came from these sales.
Earlier this year, MAS forecast taxable profits for the current year of
MDollars 372m. Airline analysts say MAS has benefitted from a 20 per cent
rise in domestic air fares approved by the government in June. But they say
that, despite the six-month rise in profits, the full-year profit projection
is unlikely to be met.
Last month, a fire at Kuala Lumpur's main airport caused traffic disruption
for more than two weeks. The fire came during the holiday season, and
analysts say that it cut MAS revenues.
MAS is in the middle of what is one of the global aviation industry's
biggest expansion programmes. In the course of its present five-year plan -
1991-92 to 1996-97 - MAS has orders for 72 aircraft costing a total of
MDollars 10.6bn.
Earlier this month MAS launched Malaysia's biggest rights issue yet to raise
MDollars 1.75bn in a one-for-one offering, which MAS said was oversubscribed
by 3.9 per cent.
