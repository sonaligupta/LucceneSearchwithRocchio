FT  20 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Delayed contract behind fall at AIM


Shares in AIM Group fell 20p to 146p yesterday as the maker of aircraft
interior fittings reported a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.52m to
Pounds 1.01m for the year to April 30.
The company said the outcome had been severely affected by a continuing weak
market and a delay in the contract for the interior of the Saab 2000. The
contract - the company's biggest - was not now scheduled to reach economic
production rates until the last quarter of the year.
Profits were struck after a charge of Pounds 199,000 from discontinued
operations and reorganisation costs of Pounds 584,000. Turnover fell to
Pounds 33.2m (Pounds 42.7m), of which Pounds 152,000 (Pounds 1.04m) came
from discontinued operations.
Last year the company booked losses of Pounds 1.45m from discontinued
operations. These, though, were offset by a Pounds 1.34m profit on
disposals.
Earnings per share emerged at 4.2p (17.9p) and the recommended final
dividend of 3p (6p) gives a total of 4.5p (7.5p).
