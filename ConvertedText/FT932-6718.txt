FT  27 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tax break on EC visits by MPs


MPs travelling to European Community institutions on parliamentary business
will no longer have to pay income tax on the money they receive to meet the
cost of such visits.
Mr Michael Portillo, Treasury chief secretary, said yesterday he had tabled
a new clause to the finance bill making the concession, which means that
parliamentary travel within the EC is treated on the same basis as UK
Commons-related trips.
