FT  30 APR 94 / C Europeans speed tariff cuts: International News Digest


   By NICK DENTON


   BUDAPEST


The four central European countries agreed yesterday to advance the
timetable for tariff reductions by three years and establish a free trade
zone by the end of 1997. Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia
agreed on fresh cuts in customs duties on industrial goods of between a
quarter and a third to take effect from July 1 this year.
Under the terms of the 1993 Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA)
about half of regional trade is already free and another large class of
goods will be liberalised at the end of 1996. Yesterday's additional accord
brings forward forward full liberalisation for sensitive products from
end-2000 to end-1997, but the tariff schedule for 'most sensitive' products
will remain.
