FT  07 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Upturn in new car sales lifts Reg Vardy


   By PAUL TAYLOR


The sharp recovery in new car sales was highlighted yesterday by Reg Vardy,
the Sunderland-based multi-franchise motor distribution group, which
reported a substantial increase in first-half turnover and profits.
Pre-tax profits, bolstered by a Pounds 800,000 gain on the sale of surplus
land, jumped by 97 per cent to Pounds 3.51m in the six months to October 31,
up from a restated Pounds 1.78m.
The figures have been adjusted to take account of FRS 3.
Earnings per share increased to 5.3p (2.9p) and the interim dividend is
raised to 1.4p (1.3p).
The shares rose 5p to 185p.
Turnover increased by 32 per cent to Pounds 142.7m (Pounds 108m) with
roughly 70 per cent coming from the group's 20 volume car franchises and the
remainder generated by the 6 specialist franchises.
New car sales increased from 4,000 last time to just over 6,000, including a
record 2,911 vehicles sold in August.
On a like-for-like basis, car sales expanded by about 13 per cent,
outstripping the underlying market growth.
However, the surge in sales also reflected the addition of five new
dealerships, including the acquisition of Mercedes-Benz dealerships in
Cambridge and Glasgow in May and June last year, and a Fiat/Alfa Romeo
dealership in Aberdeen, also in June.
The group spent Pounds 7.4m on acquisitions and new business developments
during the first-half and the acquired dealerships contributed Pounds
300,000 of operating profits after incurring Pounds 250,000 of initial
set-up costs.
Overall operating profits increased by 44 per cent to Pounds 3.21m (Pounds
2.22m), including Pounds 296,000 (Pounds 60,000) from acquisitions.
Mr Peter Vardy, chairman, said margins from used cars improved considerably
and contributions from service, parts and bodyshops all continued to show
encouraging growth.
