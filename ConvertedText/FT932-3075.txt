FT  16 JUN 93 / Increase in output squeezes liquidity


   By PETER NORMAN


THE short-term liquidity position of Britain's large manufacturing companies
deteriorated in the first quarter of this year, indicating that growing
manufacturing production was taking a toll of their readily available funds.
The liquidity ratio, measuring current assets maturing in less than a year
as a share of liabilities that have to be repaid in less than a year, was
the lowest since the first quarter of 1987.
The Central Statistical Office said the seasonally adjusted ratio for large
manufacturing companies fell to an estimated 95 per cent at the end of March
from 101 per cent in the previous quarter, and a recent peak of 121 per cent
reached in the first three months of last year.
By contrast, the ratio for large UK non-manufacturing companies increased to
132 per cent in the first quarter from 121 per cent three months before, and
was higher than the 126 per cent of March last year.
The liquidity of all large UK industrial and commercial companies was little
changed.
