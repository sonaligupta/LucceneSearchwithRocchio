FT  12 APR 94 / UK Elections - Major's Campaign: Registration deadline nears
for Euro elections


   By KEVIN BROWN


Time is running out for about 400,000 non-British citizens of the European
Union living in the UK to register to vote in the European parliament
elections, Kevin Brown writes.
The initial round of registrations with local government returning officers
closed on March 29, but the Home Office says applications will be considered
up to April 22.
There are fears that many potential voters may not be aware that the
Maastricht treaty on European Union extended the right to vote to EU
citizens living outside their home country.
The Home Office took no steps to publicise voting rights until February 28,
when it issued a press notice to newspapers. The notice was followed in
early March by a further press release and an article for regional
newspapers written by Mr Peter Lloyd, the Home Office minister of state.
The Home Office says these were 'appropriate steps' to publicise the new
franchise, which was finally agreed by the Council of Ministers in December
last year.
'This left us only a very short time to bring forward legislation to give
effect here to the new voting rights. Nevertheless we were able to make new
regulations with a minimum of delay,' the department said.
The extension of the franchise was intended to increase the importance of
the European parliament by giving voting rights to about 5m EU citizens
living outside their country of citizenship, including 400,000 Britons.
