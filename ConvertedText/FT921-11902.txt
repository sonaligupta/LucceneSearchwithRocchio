FT  29 JAN 92 / Russia awards oil and gas contract

A US-Japanese consortium has won a much-contested tender to evaluate oil and
gas reserves off Russia's far-eastern island of Sakhalin.
Moscow says the study will lead to a Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.7bn) exploration
and development project.
Marathon Oil and McDermott International of the US and Japan's Mitsui and Co
defeated four other teams, one of which included Exxon.
The deal appears to be the most ambitious of its kind to date. The Russian
government hopes to conclude several more agreements with western oil
companies to help revive flagging domestic production.
The deal, due to be concluded on March 31, is for a feasibility study into
the development of reserves estimated at 730m barrels of oil and more than
400bn cubic metres of gas. Such resources are of immediate interest to
Japan, which lies just south of Sakhalin.
A Mitsui official said the consortium had made 'small' changes to its
original proposals, after Russia set new conditions, some related to the
needs of local people.
A Russian industry expert said that local authorities in Sakhalin had
pressed for the tender to be restarted from scratch. The choice of the
US-Japanese consortium signified a victory for central authorities in
Moscow.
Although the agreement is formally for a feasibility study, the oil
companies are likely to have reached an understanding with Russian
authorities on profit-sharing. Moscow is also due soon to produce
legislation on mineral rights to clarify the position of foreign investors.
The feasibility study should take about 18 months. Production would be
unlikely to start until the late 1990s.
