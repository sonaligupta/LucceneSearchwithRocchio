FT  07 JAN 94 / People: Post Office Counters


Post Office Counters, which among other activities is one of the bidders for
the UK's national lottery scheme, has made two senior appointments which
bolster its drive towards becoming more commercially-minded in its retail
operations.
David Walker, who joined British Airways in 1975 as a graduate trainee and
eventually became its commercial manager, will head a new business centre -
the branded markets business centre - which will be responsible for managing
the company's own label products, leading its national lottery bid and
increasing its share of the communications market. Besides the national
lottery bid, Walker, 40, sees the 175 post office shops as being a prime
area for future expansion and development.
Chester Wallace, has been appointed director of another new business centre
 -the agency development centre - designed to support post office agents and
franchisees.
In 1974, Wallace, 46, joined Allied Suppliers - which later became Argyll
Foods and was acquired by Safeway in 1987, the year he left to work in
retail management consultancy. Before this latest move he spent three years
with Touche Ross management consultancy, again working on the retail sector.
Post Office Counters - which in 1992 had income of Pounds 1.1bn - runs the
UK's 900 'crown office' post office outlets as well as the 18,000 sub-post
offices and post office franchises, the latter accounting for 75 per cent of
its business.
