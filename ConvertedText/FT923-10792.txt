FT  29 JUL 92 / Hopes of breakthrough fade at London talks


   By REUTER


HOPES for a breakthrough in Bosnian peace talks in London were fading
yesterday, diplomats said, as Bosnia's foreign minister declared he would
not negotiate while the streets of his republic were littered with unburied
corpses, Reuter reports.
Mr Haris Silajdzic, a Moslem, also effectively rejected the latest EC peace
plan, saying the proposed division of the republic would produce ethnic
splits 'drawn in blood'.
EC negotiator Jose Cutileiro was canvassing views at separate meetings with
Bosnia's three factions about a constitutional blueprint splitting the
republic which is acceptable to Serbs and Croats but not to Moslems. After
meeting the mediator, Bosnia's Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic backed the
initiative, accused Moslems of breaking a ceasefire and called for
face-to-face talks.
Mr Cutileiro, chairing the second day of talks, has put together a formula
which includes a tribunal to monitor human rights but the Moslems reject at
any carve-up.
