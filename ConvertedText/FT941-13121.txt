FT  27 JAN 94 / Population expected to reach peak of 62m


   By ALAN PIKE


The UK's population will continue rising to a peak of 62.2m in the year
2027, after which deaths are expected to exceed births.
Scotland's population, however, is likely to reach a peak by the turn of the
century, with losses from migration then exceeding any natural increase.
The UK has an ageing population. In 1961 less than 12 per cent of the
population was over the age of 65. This rose to 16 per cent in 1991, and
will rise above 22 per cent by 2031. By contrast, the proportion of children
under 16 fell from 25 per cent in 1961 to 20 per cent in 1991, and is
projected to decline further to 18 per cent in 2031.
In 1951 there were 21 people of pensionable age for every 100 of working
age. The figure is now about 30 per 100, and will rise to 46 per 100 in
2031. Comparing the number of pensioners and children in the population with
those of working age available to support them creates the dependency ratio.
This was 57 in 1951, it rose to 63 in 1991 and is expected to reach 79 by
2031.
The 1991 population census has provided a range of new information about
ethnic minorities. The biggest individual ethnic group is Indian - forming
1.5 per cent of the national population, or 28 per cent of all ethnic
minorities. The three combined black categories of black Caribbean, black
African and other black people constitute 1.6 per cent of the nation, or 30
per cent of the ethnic-minority population.
