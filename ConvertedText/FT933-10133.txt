FT  05 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Significant diamond drill for
Kennecott

TWO JOINT ventures headed by Kennecott, US subsidiary of the UK's RTZ mining
group, have reported encouraging drilling results at diamond properties in
Canada's Northwest Territories.
Mr Chris Jennings, president of SouthernEra Resources, one of Kennecott's
partners, said yesterday that the results from four kimberlite pipes were
'equivalent to or even much better than many producing mines'.
SouthernEra and the other junior partners hope Kennecott will help finance a
bulk sampling programme, which would involve the extraction of at least
5,000 tonnes of ore from the claim sites. A SouthernEra official said the
programme would cost about CDollars 10m (Pounds 5.2m)
The latest drilling results cover two claim blocks, known as DHK and WO,
located south-west of the Lac de Gras area, where another consortium led by
Australia's BHP has reported a significant diamond discovery.
One drill hole on the WO block produced 42 macro-diamonds and 134
micro-diamonds from a sample of 125.3kg of ore. All the macro-diamonds are
bigger than 0.5mm in diameter.
The Kennecott and BHP groups are among a large number of companies that have
staked claims across a vast area of the Northwest Territories in the hope of
a large diamond find. De Beers, the South African group, also has interests
in the area, but has not disclosed the results of its work or its
intentions.
