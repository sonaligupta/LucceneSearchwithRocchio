FT  06 NOV 93 / International Company News: Deficit at Royal Bank of Canada


   By ROBERT GIBBENS


   MONTREAL


ROYAL Bank of Canada will report a net loss of about CDollars 425m
(USDollars 326m), or CDollars 1.50 a share, for the 1992-93 fourth quarter
following an increase in loan loss provisions and a CDollars 300m charge for
integrating Royal Trust.
This will leave net profit for the fiscal year ended October 31 at about
CDollars 300m, or 45 cents per common share, against a profit of CDollars
107m, equal, after preferred dividends, to a loss of 5 cents per common
share, for 1991-92.
Royal Bank became Canada's biggest financial institution by taking over
Royal Trust,the number two trust company, in September.
Before that deal it took over an insurance company.
The disclosure of additional provisions and the special Royal Trust charge
are being made a month before the fourth quarter results are due to be
released.
'We're dealing aggressively with our loan portfolio and our cost structure
and shareholders can look forward to a good fiscal 1994 with lower loan
losses, better productivity and higher profitability,' said Mr Allan Taylor,
chairman.
In the fourth quarter the bank will provide an additional CDollars 200m to
cover problem property and pulp and paper industry loans. It will also make
a CDollars 550m general provision because of the weak economic recovery.
But it has a CDollars 450m market value surplus on its Third World loan
portfolio, an increase of CDollars 150m from the third quarter.
Total fourth-quarter loan loss provisions will be CDollars 1bn, which will
bring the full year's total to CDollars 1.75bn, against just over CDollars
2bn in 1991-92.
At the end of October, total net non-performing loans excluding Royal Trust,
amounted to about CDollars 3bn, against CDollars 3.5bn a year earlier.
Total provision in the current year will be less than half 1992-93's
CDollars 1.75bn, the bank estimates.
However, the fourth quarter will also bear a CDollars 110m restructuring
charge to cover further rationalisation at branch level and in back-office
functions.
