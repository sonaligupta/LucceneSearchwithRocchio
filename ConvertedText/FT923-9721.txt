INDIA'S prime minister, Mr Narasimha Rao, yesterday denied that his office
had 'interfered or brought pressure' on Mr K. Madhavan, the head of the
official investigation into the Bombay financial scandal. Mr Madhavan
resigned last week, prompting speculation of political interference.
Mr Rao rejected opposition allegations that he had asked the joint director
of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to 'go slow' with an
investigation against ministers and senior officers.
He said: 'Nothing would be allowed to come in the way of a complete
investigation. The guilty would be punished, and there was no question of
any attempt to protect the guilty, no matter who the individual, or what his
position in government or society.' The prime minister also denied
allegations that cabinet ministers were involved.
Mr Madhavan denied he had laid down conditions to withdraw his resignation,
and said the inquiry was 'not dependent on one person' and would go on.
Mr George Fernandes, leader of the Janata Party, said: 'The prime minister's
remark that he 'would have liked Mr Madhavan to complete the important task
entrusted to him' implies that they would like him to go.' Mr Fernandes has
said he was approached by the government to persuade Mr Madhavan to change
his mind and withdraw his resignation.
Suspected Sikh militants shot dead 29 Hindus, including three women and two
children, in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, Reuter reports from
Lucknow.
Police said yesterday the bodies of the victims were found on the banks of
the Khannaur river.
The latest deaths take the number of people killed in separatist violence in
Uttar Pradesh to 200 in the past year.
In a separate incident in Punjab, at least five Sikh militants and an Indian
army soldier were killed in a day-long gun battle near Amritsar.
