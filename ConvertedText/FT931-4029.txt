FT  12 MAR 93 / International Company News: ABB plans Asia move as profits
dip

ASEA BROWN BOVERI, Europe's biggest electrical engineering company, plans to
spend Dollars 1bn over the next five years to expand its presence in the
rapidly-rowing markets of Asia.
The Swiss-Swedish engineering group yesterday announced a 4 per cent decline
in 1992 pre-tax profits after financial items to Dollars 1.11bn from Dollars
1.15bn. The result was in line with expectations, and reflects two years of
recession in western Europe.
The group had 213,400 employees at the end of last year, and has shed 35,000
jobs since the spring of 1990. Net of acquisitions, jobs are still being
shed at a rate of 1,000 a month, said Mr Percy Barnevik, ABB's president and
chief executive.
He stressed that the job cuts were one of a number of factors that had
strengthened ABB through the past two years of recession.
The group had reduced its net debt by Dollars 2bn to zero over 1991 and
1992, and had increased research and development spending by Dollars 450m.
Last year's R&D spend was Dollars 2.4bn, 8 per cent of its Dollars 29.6bn
revenues.
Yesterday's figures underlined the large differences in financial
performance of ABB's business segments. The best performer was power plants,
which lifted profits to Dollars 444m last year from Dollars 366m in 1991.
In contrast, the struggling transportation business, which includes the
former Brel railway rolling stock builder in the UK, plunged to a Dollars
40m loss from a Dollars 21m profit.
Mr Barnevik said it would take a couple of years for ABB's restructuring
efforts to bring earnings in transportation up to average levels for the
group.
In regional terms, Asia was the star performer for ABB last year, with
orders up 34 per cent to Dollars 6.6bn. Mr Goran Lindahl, executive
vice-president with responsibility for Asia, said the goal was to double the
order intake over the next five years.
ABB has 21,000 employees in Asia, and Mr Lindahl said ABB was involved in
joint venture talks with about 50 companies in the region.
Mr Barnevik said the group could finance its Asian and eastern European
expansion internally by reducing working capital.
He said he did not see the need to raise any new equity, and would not
comment on long-rumoured plans for an ABB share issue - the two parent
companies Asea and BBC Brown Boveri each own half of ABB and are
publicly-quoted, but ABB is not.
Overall, ABB's orders rose 7 per cent last year to Dollars 31.6bn. Increased
non-recurring items left net income down 17 per cent at Dollars 505m
compared with Dollars 609m for the same period in the previous year.
On the outlook, Mr Barnevik said he expected profits after financial items
to be about the same this year as the Dollars 1.11bn achieved in 1992.
The US market for consumable items would pick up slowly, he said, spilling
over into Europe by the end of the year. But domestic conditions would
remain tough in Scandinavia, and there would be a further decline in demand
in Germany.
The latest figures from ABB round off the first five years of trading for
one of Europe's most important manufacturing companies.
Since ABB was formed in 1988, it has undergone both heavy restructuring in
Europe and North America and significant expansion elsewhere - especially in
eastern Europe and Asia.
