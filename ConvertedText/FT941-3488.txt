FT  16 MAR 94 / Tea Time sells for Pounds 100,050


   By ANTONY THORNCROFT


A painting of a mother and child by the American Impressionist Karl Buehr
sold for Pounds 100,050 at Phillips in London yesterday. 'Tea Time' had been
estimated at Pounds 2,000-Pounds 3,000 but aroused considerable interest,
with 10 telephone bidders.
It eventually went to the New York dealer James Berry Hill. Buehr worked in
Giverny in France in the early 20th century and his last work at auction,
offered at Chicago last year, sold for just Pounds 559.
At Christie's an auction of more than 200 pictures of birds was 89 per cent
sold by value. However an important painting by the leading bird artist,
Archibald Thorburn, of 'European Mallard and Teal in Winter', went below
estimate for Pounds 24,150.
The art market is picking up after a long recession when sellers were
reluctant to offer works for auction. Among the stronger sectors is
furniture, and in New York at the weekend Sotheby's sold an English
marquetry side cabinet for Dollars 184,380 (Pounds 122,500), double its
estimate.
