FT  24 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Hibernian shows jump to IPounds 8.25m


Hibernian Group, the Dublin-based insurance company, more than doubled
pre-tax profits in 1991, from IPounds 3.66m to IPounds 8.25m (Pounds 7.68m),
reflecting, said Mr Edmund Williams, chairman, the underwriting improvement
in the Republic and the reduction in storm damage claims.
Total premium income from life assurance rose by almost IPounds 10m to
IPounds 49.1m and from non-life insurance to IPounds 151.9m (IPounds
134.9m). Losses from underwriting were cut from IPounds 24.3m to IPounds
20.4m, while investment income grew to IPounds 28.2m (IPounds 27.9m).
Earnings advanced to 10.2p (4.4p) per share and the final dividend is lifted
to a proposed 3.8p for a total of 5.7p (5.2p).
