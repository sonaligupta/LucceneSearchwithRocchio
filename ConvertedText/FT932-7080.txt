FT  26 MAY 93 / Massacre shatters Kurdish ceasefire

   ISTANBUL


KURDISH rebels in Turkey yesterday shattered a fragile ceasefire, killing 30
soldiers in an attack on a bus near the eastern city of Bingol.
The attack ends any hope for an early end to the eight-year conflict. The
acting prime minister, Mr Erdal Inonu, immediately suspended a government
decree extending a partial amnesty to the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK)
rebels.
The attack, on Monday evening, was the first rebel attack on government
forces since the PKK leader, Mr Abdullah Ocalan, declared a unilateral
ceasefire on March 20.
The rebels forced a bus carrying soldiers to stop at a roadblock, ordered
the troops off the bus and shot them, the regional governor's office in
Diyarbakir said. Another 15 people were abducted, including eight soldiers.
Turkish commandos yesterday recovered the bodies of 30 soldiers and four
civilians from a ravine. The bus and five other vehicles were set on fire by
the rebels.
On Monday, Turkey's newly elected President Suleyman Demirel convened a
special meeting of the National Security Council to approve a decree
offering reduced sentences to rebels charged with direct involvement in the
bloodshed, and a pardon for rebels who had fled to the mountains but had not
been involved in attacks. Death sentences for those already charged were to
be commuted to life imprisonment.
Mr Inonu's Social Democratic Populist party (SHP) has been urging its senior
coalition partner, the True Path party (DYP), to announce reforms in the
wake of the rebel ceasefire.
Mr Inonu said yesterday the decree had only been suspended.
However, the renewed rebel violence is expected to strengthen cabinet
hardliners who suspected the ceasefire was a ploy.
