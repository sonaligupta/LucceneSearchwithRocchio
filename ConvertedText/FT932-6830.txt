FT  26 MAY 93 / New president to face uphill task


   By REUTER


   LAGOS


NIGERIA'S two presidential hopefuls have promised voters a quick economic
fix but whoever wins next month's poll will face a daunting task to mend
sub-Saharan Africa's biggest economy, Reuter reports from Lagos.
Mr Bashir Tofa, the National Republican Convention (NRC) candidate, and Mr
Moshood Abiola, the Social Democratic party (SDP) flag-bearer, have both
made treatment of the debt-ridden economy the main campaign issue.
Mr Tofa, a bank chairman, said on radio that raising the value of Nigeria's
naira currency would be his priority, if elected. Mr Abiola, a newspaper
tycoon, said on television he could strengthen the currency and turn the
economy round within six months of taking office.
Both candidates pledged to raise the capacity utilisation of cash-strapped
industries, tackle unemployment and reduce Nigeria's heavy debt burden -
vote-catching statements in a nation where most people's living standards
have dropped since the army toppled the country's last civilian government
in 1983.
But economists doubt their programmes will do more to solve basic economic
problems than the military government's free market-oriented Structural
Adjustment Programme.
'Neither candidate has really dealt with the real issues. . . how to curb
corruption, restore local and foreign confidence in the economy and reduce
dependence on imports,' a Lagos-based western banker said.
The incoming civilian government is likely to inherit an economy burdened by
about Dollars 28bn of foreign debts, a weak naira, high inflation and a
population that expects relief from years of austerity.
