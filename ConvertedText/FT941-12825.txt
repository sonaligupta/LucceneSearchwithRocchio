FT  28 JAN 94 / Renewable energy projects criticised


   By BRONWEN MADDOX


Government projects on 'renewable' energy technologies have not focused
enough on their export potential, the National Audit Office said yesterday.
The Department of Trade and Industry has also concentrated on too few
projects and technologies, the office added in its review. But it concluded
that the programme, which has cost Pounds 340m in 1992-93 prices, is
'soundly based'.
The programme was set up in the 1970s following the oil crisis. A government
advisory group concluded a year ago that within 30 years renewable energy
could 'plausibly' provide 5 per cent to 20 per cent of electricity supply at
1991 levels.
Three projects used a third of the Pounds 340m: wind turbines, barrages on
the Mersey and Severn rivers, and investigations on Cornish granite rocks.
The Renewable Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Programme, NAO,
HMSO. Pounds 8.15.
