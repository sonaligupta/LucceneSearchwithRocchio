FT  01 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Glaxo nervous


   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN


Pharmaceuticals group Glaxo was another Footsie casualty as the share price
reacted to a key resignat-ion and competition worries in the US.
Initially, the shares fell on news that Dr Franz Humer, the chief operating
director, is leaving the company to take up another job in the industry.
Analysts said that the news was a disappointment as Dr Humer is highly
regarded within the industry, but there had been no suggestions of a
boardroom rift. Dr Humer is rumoured to be going to Sandoz or Roche.
The blow to sentiment was increased by market focus on a key US Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) advisory meeting on Losec, the stomach ulcer drug
of Swedish rival Astra.
The meeting, scheduled for today and tomorrow, is expected to recommend that
there is no need for side-effect warnings to accompany the drug, which is
the principal competitor to Zantac, Glaxo's headline drug. If the warnings
are removed then Losec can be approved for long term use. Glaxo shares were
down 13 at one stage and closed 8 1/2 off at 616 1/2p.
Motor parts group T&N continued to wilt under the impact of cash drain and
rights issue worries, sliding a further 20 to 166p in active trading. At 15m
shares, turnover was 6m more than on Tuesday when the company disclosed an
unexpected Pounds 100m jump in asbestos-related provisions.
According to NatWest Securities, the extra provisions plus any takeover of
German pistons group Kolbenschmidt - T&N's option on a 52 per cent stake in
the company runs out next March - will increase group net borrowings as a
proportion of net worth to around 100 per cent, without taking account of
possible goodwill write-offs.
Accordingly any rights issue is likely to be sizeable, possibly a
one-for-three, said the broker. The shares have now tumbled 25 per cent in
two days.
Cement producers mostly breathed a sigh of relief at the size of the fines
imposed by the European Union on competition infringement grounds, with Blue
Circle gaining 3 at 304p in 2.4m turnover and Rugby adding a penny at 123p.
The sector has been weak in the run-up to the EU's ver-dict, with most
commentators braced for fines of up to 6 per cent of European turnover. In
the event, Blue Circle faces a fine of 4.6 per cent of sales, or Pounds
12.3m.
This represents some 5 per cent of the middle range of brokers' estimates
for Blue Circle's 1994 pre-tax profits. The profits cost is also around 5
per cent at Rugby, while CRH - down a penny at 341p - faces a 2 per cent
cost.
Regional electricity companies rose sharply as the market celebrated the
lack of new taxes for the sector in the Budget.
Worries about a windfall tax, fears that the government may reduce tax
credits on share buy- backs and recent political uncertainty had combined to
cast a shadow over the sector.
Market watchers expect a strong performance from the sector as the results
season opens today, with bumper dividend increases of around 20 per cent
expected.
Seeboard, which reports interims today, was among the strong performers
yesterday and the shares jumped 19 to 425p. Northern climbed 28 to 838p and
East Midland advanced 18 to 766p, while Yorkshire gained 17 at 730p.
The news in the Budget that the government plans to introduce a tax on
landfill hit water stocks with an exposure to the waste sector. Wessex Water
fell 8 1/2 to 289 1/2p, while Severn Trent receded 6 to 534p and
Northumbrian relinquished 8 to 692p.
Shanks & McEwan dropped 5 to 84p and Leigh Interests shed 5 to 169p on
worries over the new tax.
Clearing bank shares rebounded following weakness on Tuesday when the sector
was unsettled by pre-Budget worries. National Westminster rose 14 to 521p,
Barclays 13 1/2 to 608 1/2p and Lloyds 8 1/2 to 574 1/2p.
Concern that discount houses would lose out following the Budget
announcement establishing an open market for gilt repos left Cater Allen
down 6 at 483p and King & Shaxson off a penny at 114p.
Insurer General Accident slipped a penny to 533p. Smith New Court is a
seller on the argument that the premium to net asset value will remain too
high unless US Treasuries recover.
News and electronic information service Reuters gained 10 at 491p, with
support from news that the company has established a new international
division to market and develop insurance information.
Chemicals leader ICI jumped 16 to 762p on the combination of a firm dollar
and the removal of a line of stock which had been overhanging the share
price.
Telecoms shares were active, with BT seeing 8.7m shares traded and improving
5 1/2 to 379 1/2p following a buy recommendation from Hoare Govett. Cable
and Wireless added 8 at 387p in 2.5m turnover.
Nervous trading in Grand Metropolitan ahead of today's final figures saw the
shares surrender 5 to 383p. Property Group MEPC is another stock reporting
annual results today. Dealers were positive and the shares put on 3 at 403p.
The market appeared to have discounted an increase in duties on alcohol,
thus shares in drinks group Bass gave up 11 to 528p.
