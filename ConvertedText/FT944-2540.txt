FT  16 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Not a banker with that hat


   From Mrs CHARLES BLACKWOOD


Sir, Your article, 'Not yet the death knell' (December 10/11) impels me to
challenge the photo caption, 'Gentlemen bankers in Throgmorton Street near
the Bank of England, 1967'.
My father, in top hat, was at the time gilt-edged partner at Cazenove. He
would be turning in his grave at being described as a 'banker'.
