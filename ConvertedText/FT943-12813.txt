FT  22 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Telemetrix shows 35% fall to Pounds 5.2m


   By TIM BURT


Telemetrix, the UK-based supplier of specialised electronic components,
yesterday blamed a price war in North America for a 35 per cent decline in
interim profits.
Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 7.9m to Pounds 5.2m for the six months to
June 30; the group said it was a victim of a 17 per cent decline in average
US component prices in the second quarter.
GTI Corporation, the 58 per cent-owned US subsidiary and largest division,
endured the brunt of the downturn. Operating profits fell from Dollars 9.7m
to Dollars 4.2m (Pounds 2.7m).
Although demand for networking components supplied by Valor, GTI's main
subsidiary, grew by 25 per cent, turnover in North America was virtually
unchanged at Pounds 43.3m - representing the bulk of the group total of
Pounds 65.5m (Pounds 61.5m).
Mr Tim Curtis, chief executive, accused US competitors of selling components
at unsustainable margins, but claimed that Telemetrix was strong enough to
sit out the price war.
'Our competitors are pricing in a stupid way, it cannot last. But GTI must
move its product mix from lower to higher margin components.'
The company has also increased capacity to meet growing demand, by opening
new plants in the Philippines and China.
Falling profits in North America were offset partly by an improved
performance by Zetex and Trend, the two wholly owned UK subsidiaries.
Zetex increased operating profits from Pounds 1.25m to Pounds 1.4m, while
Trend's contribution rose by 43 per cent to Pounds 975,000.
Mr Curtis said both companies had enjoyed improved margins and were
benefiting from sales of innovative products to the semi-conductor and
telecommunications sectors.
Increased cash generation by the UK companies helped lift bank reserves from
Pounds 9.31m to Pounds 11.9m. Mr Curtis said those funds would be used for
product development and technology acquisitions in markets such as Germany.
Earnings per share fell to 3.1p (3.8p) and the company continued its
practice of not paying an interim dividend.
