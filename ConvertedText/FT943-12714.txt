FT  23 JUL 94 / 'Manchester plc' profits up


   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent


'Manchester plc', the aggrega-tion of the results of the top 100 companies
in the conurbation, made Pounds 1.48bn pre-tax profit in 1993-94, a rise of
6.5 per cent over the previous year's Pounds 1.39bn - in spite of the period
reflecting the worst effects of recession for many of the companies
involved.
The 'accounts', compiled by Manchester's KPMG Peat Marwick, lag behind the
economy because they are a compilation of figures which are themselves
historical.
Mr Alan Benzie, managing partner of KPMG in Manchester, warns that
confidence remains fragile and the strength of recovery will require careful
monitoring if companies are to become sufficiently reassured to try to force
expansion again.
Turnover - the criterion by which the 100 companies were selected and ranked
 -was only Pounds 10,000 short of Pounds 29bn, compared with Pounds 27.94bn
in the 1992-93 'accounts'. Although this was only a 3.8 per cent increase,
as opposed to the previous year's 4.9 per cent, it was ahead of an inflation
rate of less than 3 per cent.
This means that combined with increased profitability, industry and commerce
gained in efficiency and performance as recession forced restructuring, on
manufacturers in particular. This helped ensure an almost unchanged return
on capital of 8.3 per cent.
Operating profit was marginally better at 6.3 per cent compared with 5.8 per
cent.
