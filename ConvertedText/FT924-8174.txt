FT  12 NOV 92 / People: Shake-up at JP Morgan


A 39-year-old British banker has been given the job of running the London
operations of JP Morgan, the US bank, as part of a management shake-up
intended to give the bank a stronger focus in its European businesses.
Adam Wethered, who has been with the bank for 16 years, takes over a
1,700-strong office, one of the biggest of any foreign financial institution
in London.
A corporate financier at the start of his career, Wethered followed a
circuitous route through project financing and shipping finance, with a
brief spell in New York involved in the securities and trust businesses,
before returning to London as co-head of Morgan's European corporate finance
business last year.
Unlike many other US banks, JP Morgan's operations in continental Europe -
where it employs 2,500 people - exceed its operations in London.
To get these businesses working more effectively together, Morgan has set up
a European management committee, one of whose first chairmen is Wethered's
predecessor in London, Walter Gubert. Marcus Meier has been sent from New
York as a second co-chairman.
The new committee will stand outside the bank's formal reporting lines and
organisational structure, and instead will act as a forum for senior
executives from across the continent to swap ideas.

Midlands, as director of logistics for the parts and components division of
