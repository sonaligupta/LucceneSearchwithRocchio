FT  17 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Unilever acquires Hungarian group


Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products company, has made its first
investment in food manufacturing in eastern Europe by acquiring the ice
cream operations of VMTV, a Hungarian state-owned dairy group.
No price was disclosed but Unilever said it planned to invest Dollars 10m
(Pounds 5.5m) in the Hungarian business, to increase production capacity
five-fold by next year and develop a national distribution system.
VMTV began importing Unilever ice cream from Austria last spring, since when
the companies' combined sales have amounted to about 3m litres. Hungary's
total ice cream consumption is about 30m litres a year.
