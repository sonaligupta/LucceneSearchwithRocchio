FT  30 JUN 93 / International Company News: Sumitomo investment in LTV to go
ahead

THE emergence of LTV, the US steel group, from Chapter 11 bankruptcy this
week has triggered a Dollars 200m investment in the group by Sumitomo Metal
Industries of Japan.
The investment, announced when LTV filed its financial reorganisation plan
early last year, involved Dollars 100m in convertible voting preferred stock
and Dollars 100m in senior secured convertible notes, about a 10 per cent
stake in the third largest US steel manufacturer.
SMI's investment comes regardless of the burdens on other Japanese
steelmakers which took equity stakes in US companies. Kawasaki Steel
announced a group loss of Y30bn (Dollars 282m), mostly due to restructuring
costs at Armco Steel of the US, in which it has a 50 per cent stake.
The investment follows ventures which began in 1984 and was decided partly
in response to the friction created by Japanese steel exports to the US,
which have been hit by anti-dumping duties.
Sumitomo has about 10 factories in the US, but said demand from Japanese
carmakers and electronics companies had increased the need for high-quality
steel, which the closer relationship with LTV was intended to provide.
