FT  28 SEP 94 / Rome tax inspectors in corruption inquiry


   By ROBERT GRAHAM


   ROME


Rome magistrates are investigating for alleged abuse of office the entire
eight-man directorate at the Finance Ministry responsible for tax inspection
and evasion.
The investigation relates to the tax treatment accorded the
Ferruzzi-Montedison group during the transfer in 1989 of chemical assets to
form Enimont, the joint venture with Eni, the state oil concern.
The senior ministry officials are alleged to have ignored potential tax
liabilities totalling some L900bn (Pounds 367m) on the added value of
Montedison's assets in the joint venture.
They are also alleged to have ignored a report from within the Finance
Ministry objecting to such favourable treatment of the group, then run by Mr
Raul Gardini. They have denied the allegations.
This is the most serious investigation affecting any single group of
officials in the past 2 1/2 years of corruption scandals. The special
directorate - headed by Mr Luigi Mazzillo, who has held the post since
February 1990 - includes the directors-general of personnel and of
information technology at the Finance Ministry, as well as three
magistrates, one of whom is seconded from the court of public accounts.
The move by Rome magistrates comes at a time when Mr Giulio Tremonti, the
finance minister, has promised to fight tax evasion. It is unrelated to
another investigation by Milan magistrates into bribes paid to officials of
the Guardia di Finanza, the financial police, to make favourable tax
assessments of businesses.
Already most of the top politicians and business figures involved in setting
up Enimont, and then the 1990 purchase of Montedison's 40 per cent stake by
Eni for an inflated price, have been charged with corruption.
