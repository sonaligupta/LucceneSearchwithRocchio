FT  12 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei holds fast as
Hong Kong rises 3.7%


   By EMIKO TERAZONO


   TOKYO


FEARS OF an imminent plunge in share prices were dispelled after morning
buying by financial institutions, and the Nikkei average closed higher in
spite of arbitrage unwinding later in the day, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The 225-issue index finished 36.81 better at 18,158.52, after a day's high
of 18,328.63 and low of 18,076.41. Volume totalled 314m shares, against
Wednesday's 386m, investors retreating to the sidelines ahead of Friday's
settlement of stock options contracts.
Rises led falls by 503 to 474, with 187 issues unchanged. The Topix index of
all first section stocks was off 0.20 at 1,534.58, and in London the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 3.93 to 1,238.18.
Government officials denied the possibility of fiscal support for the
slumping stock market. Mr Jiro Saito, vice-finance minister, said stock
prices should be formed on the market's supply and demand.
However, a rise in East Japan Railway and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
eased fears of further falls in share prices. JR East gained Y21,000 at
Y472,000 and NTT advanced Y14,000 to Y778,000, encouraging investor
sentiment.
Daishowa Paper lost Y260 to Y1,460 after Mr Ryoei Saito, its chairman and
known for his impressionist art collection, was arrested, allegedly for
bribing politicians. The case is the most recent revelation of a Japanese
prosecutors' crusade against political corruption. Construction companies,
which have also been investigation targets, firmed yesterday, Taisei adding
Y5 at Y635 and Shimizu Y16 at Y835.
Banks were still weak on arbitrage linked selling. Industrial Bank of Japan
fell Y50 to Y3,140 while Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank declined Y20 to Y2,180.
Securities houses, however, firmed on bargain hunting. Nomura Securities
rose Y70 to Y1,850 and Daiwa Securities Y20 to Y1,280.
Retailers were higher on hopes that deregulation will help earnings.
Ito-Yokado rose Y90 to Y5,380 and York-Benimaru put on Y140 at Y4,700.
Mining issues were depressed by profit-taking. Nikko Kyodo slipped Y5 to
Y428 and Sumitomo Metal Mining lost Y2 to Y837.
In Osaka, the OSE average moved up 72.25 to 20,236.28 in volume of 20.3m
shares. Construction and textile issues gained ground on bargain hunting.
