Alcan Aluminium, of Canada, has sold its 73.3 per cent shareholding in Alcan
Australia via an international secondary offering worth USDollars 245m.
Alcan had already said that it planned to dispose of its controlling stake.
CS First Boston, the investment bankers and underwriter for the issue,
placed the Alcan Australia shares with institutional investors in Australia,
Europe, North America and Asia.
The placement totalled 130.8m shares at ADollars 2.55 (USDollars 1.87) a
share.
Meanwhile, Alcan Australia yesterday announced a return to the black for the
June half year in spite of major production cuts affecting the worldwide
aluminium industry.
The company turned a ADollars 2.9m loss into a ADollars 9.4m net profit in
the period on a marginal increase in sales revenue from ADollars 301.9m to
ADollars 307.5m.
The result followed a total tax provision of ADollars 7.5m, compared with
ADollars 8.4m previously, and interest expense of ADollars 5.4m, compared to
ADollars 6.6m.
