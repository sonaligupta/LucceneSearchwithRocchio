FT  25 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Bulgarian airline aims to have foreign
partners


   By DANIEL GREEN


BALKAN Bulgarian Airlines, the Bulgarian national airline, is seeking
foreign partners as part of its privatisation.
The UK-based financial adviser S G Warburg is preparing a prospectus on the
company and will be seeking airline partners within six weeks. Warburg said
it hopes to have found potential partners by late 1992 or early 1993.
Balkan Bulgarian Airlines has nine western-built aircraft, consisting of
five Boeings and four Airbuses. It also has a fleet of 51 aircraft from the
former Soviet Union. In 1991 it employed 4,000 people and had revenues of
about Dollars 170m (Pounds 89m), S G Warburg said.
The airline was given national carrier status by the Bulgarian Council of
ministers on August 10. This gave it a 15-year franchise as the sole
Bulgarian-based carrier to travel to 53 specified international destinations
in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and the Far East. S G Warburg said the
Bulgarian government would retain a stake in the new enterprise,though it
was not clear if this would be a controlling holding.
