FT  19 MAY 92 / Letter: Public sector stimulus and elimination of private
sector distortions would help meet need for affordable houses (3)


   From Mr SIMON RANDALL


Sir, I congratulate you on your thought-provoking leader, 'More housing
choice needed'. Now is the time for a comprehensive review of housing policy
and finance. In particular we need further to expand opportunities in the
private rented sector and to encourage more private investment and greater
involvement of major employers and financial institutions.
We also need to look at ways of improving and extending opportunities for
shared ownership and equity sharing. Rents to mortgages is just one of a
number of potential schemes. Home owners should be able to move in and out
of part ownership as their circumstances dictate. This would certainly be
preferable to the present level of repossessions and homelessness arising
from mortgage arrears. The LBA has urged the government to encourage
mortgage lenders to develop a more positive role in this field.
Increasing the opportunities for housing mobility is another area of
concern. Each year thousands of local authority and housing association
tenants are helped to move to other areas, mainly for social and employment
reasons, through Homes (Housing Organisations Mobility and Exchange
Services), which was established in 1990 and is always seeking ways to
enhance the level of service.
