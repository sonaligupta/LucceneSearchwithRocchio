FT  13 NOV 92 / Feltrim Names vote for action on losses


   By RICHARD LAPPER


MORE THAN 1,000 Names yesterday voted to take legal action in a bid to
recover insurance losses.
The Names, individuals whose assets support underwriting at Lloyd's, are
members of Feltrim syndicates 540/542 and 847, which were overwhelmed by
claims from catastrophes between 1987 and 1990.
The Feltrim Names Association is still examining the possibility of taking
action against Arthur Andersen, auditors of Feltrim's accounts; Walsham
Brothers, a reinsurance broker which placed some business with Feltrim
syndicates; and Lloyd's of London itself.
The Names agreed to raise Pounds 6.4m to finance action against syndicate
managers Feltrim Underwriting Agencies, and 59 members' agents, which
channelled them on to the syndicates. Calling for the action, Mr Colin Hook,
chairman of the association, said: 'We have to assume that talks (designed
to obtain an out-of-court settlement) will fail.'
Mr Hook added: 'If we don't litigate we won't get anything. We are going to
build our atomic bomb and the other side must be clear we will use it.'
In a note contrasting with the conciliatory mood at the Lloyd's market in
recent weeks, Mr Hook said Names be under no illusion. 'Nothing has changed;
it is just the climate.' A Lloyd's investigation into the Feltrim losses was
sharply critical of the quality of the Feltrim syndicates' underwriting. Mr
Anthony Boswood QC, who has presented a legal opinion to the association,
said that Mr Patrick Fagan, the underwriter of syndicate 540/542, 'did not
understand the market in which he was operating'.
