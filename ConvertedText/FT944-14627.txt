FT  21 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Brewers wanted


   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN and JEFFREY BROWN


Brewing shares became one of the stronger flavours of the week following a
note from James Capel suggesting the industry was heading for a spate of
takeovers. Scottish & Newcastle (up 4 on Wednesday) rose 11 to 519p,
Whitbread added 8 at 549p and Bass gained 5 at 541p.
According to Capel, the sector is running out of price war options and is
ripe for consolidation. The securities house sees the regulatory regime now
more benign than it was at the end of the 1980s, and expects at least one
major merger within a framework of 12 to 18 months.
From this distance, best bets among analysts point at a merger of S&N and
Whitbread or a deal between S&N and Courage, currently owned by Foster's
Brewing. The sector is in sore need of a boost. It has underperformed the
market by 4 per cent over the past two months and by more than a fifth on a
two-year view.
However, rationalists pointed to the low level of volume in the sector
yesterday. In fact, Grand Metropolitan, down a further penny to 415p on the
back of weak dollar worries, was the most active drinks stock, turning over
2.6m shares.
RTZ failed to benefit from the recent surge in copper prices as the shares
were restrained by a sizeable seller.
The weakness in the US dollar pushed copper to Dollars 2,600 per tonne in
London, its highest since January 1991. The metal represents some 30 per
cent of RTZ's profits but yesterday one securities house was said to be keen
to offload half a million shares. Disinterest in that stock saw the
registered shares decline 7 to 867p.
Oil shares remained under fire, weakened by another poor showing by the
dollar and general nervousness ahead of the US oil sector's third-quarter
reporting season which starts on Monday with results from Exxon, the
industry leader. Shell reports on Thursday.
'The institutions are reluctant to deal until we see a definite pattern
emerging in the US majors,' said one UK specialist, who added that the
recent decline in the US currency had upset sentiment in oils. BP dipped 4
1/2 to 403p on 7.2m traded and Shell 5 to 706p on turnover of 2.8m.
Azlan, the computing products group, was one of the market's worst
performers, plunging 32, or 20 per cent, to 128p as dealers reacted to talk
that one institution was seeking to offload a large block of stock. However,
it was clear that no abnormally large deals had taken place; turnover in
Azlan was a mere 20,000.
Telecoms put up a good performance in the face of the general market unease,
and a poor opening on Wall Street, as dealers reacted to the stream of good
results from cellular telecoms such as Sprint, Lin and Nokia. Vodafone ran
up 6 to 207p on turnover of 10m.
A number of institutions took advantage of the recent share price slippage
in the regional electricity companies (recs) to pick up what was seen as
'cheap' stock.
The sector is now in its 'closed period' but specialists point out that the
recs offer strong long-term upside in the form of outstanding dividend
potential, the prospect of big gains from the sale of stakes in the National
Grid and expected share buy-backs. Among the best rises yesterday were
Midlands, up 13 at 732p, London, ahead 11 at 687p and Manweb, 10 higher at
774p.
BTR, the subject of a buy note from Smith New Court, dipped a penny to 308p
in turnover of 13m shares, although the bulk of the volume came via a
tax-related, bed and breakfast, deal which saw 8.7m shares traded at 301p.
High street chain WH Smith improved 4 to 454p as Panmure Gordon reiterated
its positive stance on the stock. There were also a couple of
recommendations for Storehouse, a penny up at 219p.
Iceland climbed 8 to 170p, with dealers saying UBS had issued a buy
recommendation and that Hoare Govett was supporting the stock.
Strong earnings from American Airlines - an eighth ahead of the top end of
US analysts' forecast range, and the company's healthiest result for five
years - helped lift British Airways 8 to 382p in 2.3m dealt.
