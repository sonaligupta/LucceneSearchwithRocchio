FT  05 AUG 92 / Gangsters find ways around curbs


   By GORDON CRAMB

THE YAKUZA, Japan's gangsters, are adjusting to life under a new law curbing
their activities, by setting up superficially legitimate front operations,
and are continuing to expand in membership and influence, the national
police force said yesterday.
The police annual report on crime in Japan last year, chronicling
well-publicised cases of stock-cornering in the Tokyo equity market -
uncovered as share values slid during the year - warned that the existence
of the gangs 'is becoming a big threat to the healthy economic system of the
country'.
It said that known gang membership had increased 3.1 per cent since the
start of last year to stand at 91,000 by March, when a law prohibiting
'unjust acts' by yakuza came into force.
Nearly four in ten of these members were loyal to Yamaguchigumi, the largest
grouping, which increased its dominance over smaller rivals.
The police report is in part ammunition for the force in justifying budget
proposals for the coming year to a government which is having its tax
receipts squeezed by the current economic slowdown. None the less, it helps
illuminate the margins of Japan's low-crime society.
Although 17.4 per cent of those convicted last year were in financial
difficulties, this figure showed no increase as a result of the slowing down
of the economy - the proportion was 18.7 per cent a year before and 22.4 per
cent a decade earlier.
The yakuza has held back from overt clashes with rival gangs, instead
setting up companies based at their headquarters - an entity called 'Y Co
Ltd' in the case of Yamaguchigumi - as well as establishing right-wing
political front organisations and engaging in charitable works to 'improve
their image'.
