FT  13 MAR 93 / Top-level talks continuing on solidarity pact


   By QUENTIN PEEL


   BONN


THE entire German political establishment was locked away behind the closed
doors of the chancellor's office in Bonn yesterday, searching for signs of
daylight in the fine detail of their 'solidarity pact' for east Germany,
Quentin Peel writes from Bonn.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, with a string of top government ministers, the main
parliamentary party leaders, the 16 prime ministers of the federal states,
and their finance ministers and advisers, agreed to carry on negotiating in
working groups all evening, and meet again today, in an attempt to forge the
political consensus they have been seeking since last September.
A formula has to be found to finance a spending gap of DM110bn (Pounds
46.6bn) in 1995 to pour more money into the collapsed eastern economy.
The signs last night were that there was clear movement towards a political
compromise, although the final figures - at least on the burden sharing -
may take a little longer to agree. The opposition Social Democrats have won
the first battle to block any big social spending cuts.
Instead, they have agreed on a campaign to stop unemployment and social
security swindles, and to identify further savings of more than DM3bn in
other parts of the budget.
The other main move was a concession to the new states of east Germany for
the government to shoulder a share of their DM51bn housing debt.
