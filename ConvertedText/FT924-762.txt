FT  22 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Mosaic circular soon on current situation


At the annual meeting of Mosaic Investments yesterday, Mr Hugh Sykes,
chairman, told shareholders that since his appointment last October, he had
undertaken a thorough review of the group's operations.
This had involved talks with the company's bankers, holders of deferred
consideration and a number of others with a view to ensuring that the
company could be put on the best footing and achieve a relisting as soon as
possible.
Mr Sykes said that the group continued to trade profitably and he planned to
be in a position to put a circular containing a number of proposals to
shareholders as soon as possible in the new year. The interim results for
the six months to October 31 would be included in that circular.
