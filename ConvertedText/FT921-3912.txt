FT  12 MAR 92 / Observer: Spoke in the wheel


Oh dear] While Prime Minister Major and Chancellor Kohl may be the best of
pals at present, there are already omens that Anglo-German accord may not
survive Britain's election campaign.
Norman Lamont's statement in his budget speech that Germany's economy was in
'recession', provoked the German embassy in London into sending a swift and
critical report back to Bonn. The use of that word, the message said, was
calculated to give British voters the impression that the UK's economic
troubles are somehow all Germany's fault.
By the Anglo-Saxon definition, 'recession' is justified since Germany has
had two successive quarters of negative growth. But the R-word is too strong
for the German government, which points out that its economy is still
expanding on a year-on-year basis, albeit at a slower rate.
The Kiel economics institute, for instance, has just forecast that this
year's growth will be 1 per cent. Moreover Bundesbank council-member Karl
Thomas pointedly declared in London yesterday that he prefers the word
'stagnation'.
What Lamont might do well to consider is that, the more he irritates the
Germans, the less sympathy he is likely to win for Britain's bid to have the
European central bank housed in London, or more importantly for a cut in
interest rates.
