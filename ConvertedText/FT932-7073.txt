FT  26 MAY 93 / Venture capital investments grow


   By CHARLES BATCHELOR


THE European venture capital industry recorded increases in investments and
new funds raised in 1992 despite the deepening recession in much of Europe.
Investments rose by 1.5 per cent to Ecu4.7bn (Pounds 3.7bn) while the level
of new fund-raising increased by 0.6 per cent to Ecu4.2bn, according to a
survey by the European Venture Capital Association (Evca) and accountants
KPMG Peat Marwick. In 1991 new investments rose by 12 per cent but the
amount of funds raised fell by 9 per cent.
Mr John Singer, Evca president-elect, said the outcome was 'encouraging'
during a recession when many small and medium-sized businesses had great
difficulties raising finance.
Venture capitalists made a total of 6,197 investments last year, a decline
of 10 per cent in 1991, although the average size of each investment rose
from Ecu670,000 to Ecu760,000.
The most popular form of investment was in expanding, established companies.
They accounted for 46 per cent of spending last year, compared with 53 per
cent in 1991, while management buy-outs accounted for 40 per cent, compared
with 35 per cent the previous year.
Early-stage investments remained out of favour because of the risks
involved, the relatively high cost of doing deals, and the timespan. The
most popular industry sector was consumer products, representing 19 per cent
of all spending.
