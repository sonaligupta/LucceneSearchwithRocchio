FT  16 DEC 94 / Sleepy MPs plan early nights


   By JAMES BLITZ


Bleary-eyed MPs endured a marathon series of debates last night - on the day
that moves were announced to do away with such late-night sittings.
These tests of stamina should become much rarer sights in the Commons once
proposals drawn up by the main parties come into effect.
Amid recent controversy about the long hours which MPs are forced to spend
at the Commons, senior politicians have drawn up a list of changes to the
parliamentary timetable which should be introduced early next year.
They include a pledge by the government to give MPs more time in their
constituencies at weekends and another to avoid late sittings of the Commons
as much as possible.
The proposals, which were announced yesterday by Mr Tony Newton, leader of
the Commons, will reduce the amount of parliamentary business on Fridays.
Instead, private member's motions, which are regularly held at the end of
the week, will take place on Wednesday mornings.
In a parliamentary written answer, Mr Newton said that the Speaker, Miss
Betty Boothroyd, would also have wider discretion to limit speeches by
backbenchers to 10 minutes and by ministers and opposition spokesmen and
women to 20 minutes.
The call for improved parliamentary hours comes amid signs that the current
timetable has badly affected the health of some MPs. Debate on the proposals
is to take place in the Commons on Monday.
Last night's debates, which lasted well past daybreak, gave an opportunity
for backbenchers to raise topics of their choice for a response by
ministers.
The series of short debates was set to be opened after 10pm by Labour's Dr
Jeremy Bray on the issue of 'employment rights after manic depression'.
Other topics expected to be raised were Cyprus, the case for an
international station at Stratford, east London, and the pig industry. The
'night' was expected to end at about 8.30 this morning.
