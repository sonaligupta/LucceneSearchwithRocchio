FT  29 APR 94 / Observer: Gay rights


Were any sights in South Africa's election more touching than the spectacle
of a kind young lady apparently guiding an elderly black gentleman to the
polling booth?
Protective arm outstretched, she smiled proudly as he managed - without much
assistance - to drop his vote in the ballot box. Such was her devotion that
even hard-bitten photographers and television crews were unable to separate
them.
And that is how Gay McDougall - a black American, a director of the
Washington-based Southern African Programme of the Lawyers Committee for
Civil Rights under the Law, and a member of South Africa's Independent
Electoral Commission - appears in the frame of just about every picture
taken of Nelson Mandela when he cast his vote on Wednesday.
