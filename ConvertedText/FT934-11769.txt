FT  29 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Gerrard declines 27% despite
diversification


   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor


GERRARD & NATIONAL, the financial group which owns a City discount house,
yesterday announced a 27 per cent fall in interim pre-tax profits reflecting
depressed earnings in its traditional money market and gilt trading
activities.
Gerrard, which disclosed interim figures for the first time in line with the
European Community second banking directive, said profits had fallen to
Pounds 10.4m, against Pounds 14.4m, in the half year to October 5.
It said that the results showed its four-year-old strategy of diversifying
into broking operations in securities and money markets was having the
desired effect of smoothing out volatility in traditional marketmaking
activities.
Pre-tax profits of the trading division, which includes the Gerrard &
National Limited discount house and Gerrard & National Securities, the
gilt-edged marketmaker, fell to Pounds 2.5m (Pounds 8.1m), and its earnings
per share fell to 4p (13.7p).
Mr Brian Williamson, chairman, said discount house profits had fallen
sharply to Pounds 500,000 (Pounds 5.3m) because the first half of last year
had been boosted by the UK's exit from the ERM and the subsequent interest
rate volatility which increased money market trading.
The broking division, which includes the GNI Holdings futures and options
brokerage, Gerrard Vivian Gray, the stockbroker, and LM (Moneybrokers), the
stock lender and borrower, reported a rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 4.7m
(Pounds 3m).
Mr Williamson said he expected the broking division to achieve this year's
target of covering the holding company's dividend without recourse to the
trading division's profits.
The broking division's earnings per share were 10.6p (8.5p) and overall
earnings per share were 14.6p (22.2p). The interim dividend is maintained at
6p.
