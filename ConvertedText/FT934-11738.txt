NATIONAL Petrochemical Corp, the Thai olefins producer, is planning to raise
some Dollars 64m by offering a 22.5 per cent stake in the company in the
latest initial public offering to be floated on the Stock Exchange of
Thailand.
Barclays de Zoete Wedd (Asia), lead manager, said yesterday that NPC would
offer 70m new shares, of which between 27.5m and 31m would go to foreign
investors, bringing the total number of shares to 310m.
NPC produces ethylene and propylene, used as feedstock for the plastics
industry, at its upstream petrochemicals complex in Rayong on Thailand's
eastern seaboard. The offer price has not yet been set but stockbrokers in
Bangkok say the company plans to raise Bt1.5bn (Dollars 59.3m) to Bt1.7bn to
finance expansion of its plant.
The state Petroleum Authority of Thailand owns 49 per cent of the company,
with the rest held by local investors.
