FT  20 MAY 92 / Italian government approves administrative measures for
Bosnian refugees


The Italian government yesterday approved a series of administrative
measures to cut red tape in the handling of refugees from the fighting in
Bosnia. At the same time, the government stressed the problem should be
dealt with by the entire EC.
Yesterday's measures will enable the local authorities to react quicker to
any influx of refugees. Italy continues to be haunted by the spectre of the
chaos last summer in southern Italy, when the authorities tried to cope with
the invasion by boat of thousands of Albanians seeking aslyum.
