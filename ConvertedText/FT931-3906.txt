FT  13 MAR 93 / Former ally heads Seoul opposition


   By JOHN BURTON


   SEOUL


A FORMER political ally of the South Korean president was elected yesterday
as the leader of the country's main opposition Democratic Party, writes John
Burton in Seoul.
Mr Lee Ki-taek succeeds Mr Kim Dae-jung, who retired after being defeated in
the presidential election last December. Mr Lee's election follows a power
struggle within the party, which holds 97 of the 299 seats in the National
Assembly.
But it is still threatened with dissension and a possible break-up, which
could improve the parliamentary position of President Kim Young-sam's
government. Mr Lee represents a minority faction that joined the Democratic
Party in 1991. The party is dominated by followers of Mr Kim Dae-jung who
mainly come from the south-western Cholla region which historically has been
at odds with the central government in Seoul.
Mr Lee was a member of President Kim's former opposition party. When Mr Kim
decided to merge his party with the government in 1990, Mr Lee stayed in
opposition, joining the Democratic Party a year later.
