FT  13 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Shell sold


   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and PETER JOHN


Further consideration of Shell Transport's results saw the shares tumble 20
at one stage. They were hit further by heavy selling in New York late on
Thursday and there slide accounted for much of the early weakness in the
London stock market yesterday. However, a futures-inspired rally dragged
Shell back to close 14 lower on the day at 690p.
Investors had latched on to encouraging third-quarter figures from BP the
week before and convinced themselves that Shell would follow suit. In the
event the company came up with perfectly respectable numbers but they lacked
excitement and included weakness in the chemicals side of the business. Some
analysts said the company was also on a high rating while lacking the
recovery potential of BP. The latter's shares slipped 2 1/2 to 357p.
BTR was slightly weaker as speculation of a bearish Sunday newspaper article
rippled through the market. There was also talk that one analyst was
preparing an in-depth research piece on the conglomerate and that his study
would be sent to clients on Monday. In the event the shares lost only a
halfpenny at 359 1/2 p on turnover of 6.1m.
Pharmaceutical stocks were marked down at the start of trading following big
falls in the US late on Thursday. However, with the leading drugs stocks
representing a significant proportion of the FT-SE 100 index, the subsequent
rise in the futures market pulled most of the health and household stocks
upward. Glaxo was 13 off at one stage but ended the day 2 weaker at 654p.
SmithKline Beecham 'A' shares dropped 12 but ended 3 1/2 lighter at 411p and
Wellcome fell 7 before ending a penny up at 678p.
Fisons, which has suffered from concerns over allegations of bribery in its
UK regional sales promotions, rallied 4 1/2 to 143 1/2 p. There was a return
of speculation that a bid might be launched but that story raised few
eyebrows, particularly on a Friday when dealers books are being squared
ahead of the weekend.
The beleaguered food retailers rallied in the face of a week of further
negative notes from brokers. Dealers said Thursday's big deal in Tesco -
where BZW matched a buyer and seller of 29m shares at only a small discount
to the current share price - had strengthened sentiment. Tesco shares
improved further yesterday, finishing 2 1/2 up at 185 1/2 p in good volume
of 9.5m. Argyll Group climbed 9 to 258p with 8.8m traded. Shoprite Group put
on 11 to 156p.
Stores groups responded well to the latest economic statistics and the
recent positive notes on the sector anticipating a good run up to Christmas.
Kingfisher gained 8 to 662p, Marks and Spencer 6 to 402p, Great Universal
Stores 9 to 543p and Boots 5 to 515p.
Rolls-Royce shares were the outstanding feature in a weak engineering and
aerospace sector. Talk in the market suggested that the group might be set
to announce a significant link with Pratt and Whitney of the US. Yet another
denial from British Aerospace that its Taiwanese jet deal was dead failed to
stop the shares sliding. They ended 11 adrift at 430p. Profit-taking took
the shine off VSEL, down 20 at 828p. British Steel were wanted ahead of
interims on Monday, closing 1 1/2 ahead at 124 1/2 p.
Further profit-taking in SG Warburg following good figures earlier in the
week took the shares back 15 to 833p.
Courtaulds, the leading stock in the chemicals sector, rebounded 16 to 484p
as investors decided it had fallen far enough and decided to pick up shares
ahead of figures next week. In the light of the chemicals industry's
Europe-wide blight and recent disappointing results from rival companies,
the figures are not expected to sparkle. However, the shares had already
fallen from above 580p at the start of August.
Composite insurer Royal Insurance fell 10 to 306p in active as profit takers
moved in after good nine-month results and a feeling premium rates might
have peaked. Securities house Charterhouse Tilney added that it was
concerned about the insurer being hit by pollution clean-up claims in the
United States. Royal has said up to now it has only received one small
claim, related to recent fires around Los Angeles.
Strength in Cable and Wireless was attributed to Lord Young, the chairman,
who was reported to be telling US businessmen that the Mercury One-2-One
mobile telephone system would have 10m subscribers within 10 years. The
shares gained 2 to 497p.
A return of the recent bear stories on Owners Abroad sent the shares into
retreat, although turnover was relatively small. The shares slipped 6 to 78p
in turnover of just over half a million.
