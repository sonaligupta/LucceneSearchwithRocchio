   WASHINGTON


GOVERNOR Guy Hunt of Alabama was removed from office yesterday after being
found guilty of diverting to his personal use money raised for his inaugural
ceremonies, writes George Graham in Washington.
Mr Hunt - who will be replaced by a Democrat, Lieutenant Governor Jim Folsom
 -was Alabama's first Republican governor since the reconstruction period
after the civil war. He faces up to 10 years in prison, but could be
reinstated if the conviction were overturned on appeal.
A Montgomery jury found Mr Hunt guilty of violating the state ethics law by
using Dollars 200,000 (Pounds 130,000 from a fund intended to help pay for
his 1987 inauguration to buy personal property and pay off personal debts.
Mr Hunt said he had used the money properly to pay off debts from his
unsuccessful 1978 campaign for governor.
