FT  01 JUL 92 / International Company News: Paris to decide more top jobs


   By ALICE RAWSTHORN


   PARIS


THE French cabinet will today decide whether the heads of more than a dozen
state-controlled companies will keep their jobs in the third phase of its
regular three-yearly review of top jobs in the public sector.
In a surprise move, Mr Rene Thomas is expected to stay on as chairman of
Banque Nationale de Paris, the biggest French bank and a significant
investor in French industry. Mr Thomas, 63, had been expected to resign this
summer as he will reach the mandatory retirement age of 65 within his next
three-year term.
However, the government has reported to have found it difficult to find a
suitable successor. Last night, the BNP board voted for Mr Thomas, a close
friend of President Francois Mitterrand, who has headed the bank since 1982
despite a period of ill-health, to be reselected. Ministers are expected to
confirm this today.
Ministers are also expected to endorse the appointment of Mr Gilles Menage,
former head of President Mitterrand's private office, as chairman of
Electricite de France, replacing Mr Pierre Delaporte, who reaches the
mandatory retirement age next year.
The cabinet is expected to confirm the nomination of Mr Louis Gallois,
currently chairman of Snecma, the aircraft engine maker, as head of
Aerospatiale, the aircraft and missile maker, succeeding the retiring Mr
Henri Martre.
All three existing chairmen in the insurance sector - Mr Jean Peyrelevade at
Union des Assurances de Paris, Mr Michel Albert at Assurances Generales de
France, and Mr Francois Heilbronner at Groupe GAN - are expected to be
renominated for another three years.
The reselection of Mr Francis Gutmann as head of Gaz de France and of Mr
Philippe Rouvillois as chairman of CEA, the atomic energy commission, are
expected to be endorsed.
