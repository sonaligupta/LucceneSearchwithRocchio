FT  13 APR 94 / Tesco reassures after fall


   By NEIL BUCKLEY


Tesco, the UK's second biggest supermarket chain, reported a large fall in
pre-tax profits from Pounds 558m to Pounds 435.5m, but reassured the City
with news that underlying profits were level in spite of intense price
competition.
The shares gained 3p to 218p after Sir Ian MacLaurin, chairman, said gross
profit margins had been forced down significantly in the year to February
26, but had shown a 'pleasing improvement' since the year-end.
There had been a 'step change' in gross margins in the grocery industry, he
said, with superstore groups forced to cut prices in the face of competition
from the discounters, slow consumer spending growth and increasing
saturation of the grocery market.
But he did not believe this would develop into an all-out price war or
'downward spiral' of margins.
Tesco's headline profit was depressed by a one-off Pounds 92.9m loss on
property disposals, and Pounds 68.5m depreciation charges following Tesco's
decision to depreciate buildings and land premiums.
Disregarding the one-off loss and applying the new accounting policies to
last year's figures, underlying profits rose slightly from Pounds 527.3m to
Pounds 528.4m. Group turnover increased from Pounds 8.13bn to Pounds 9.25bn.
Sir Ian said Tesco had stemmed the flow of customers switching to the new
generation of cut-price discounters, such as Germany's Aldi and Denmark's
Netto, through the introduction of its 100 Tesco Value lines. These
low-price products now accounted for 3 per cent of turnover.
At the same time, the group had offered price promotions, while improving
product range, store presentation and customer service. 'The competition is
not going to get any easier,' said Sir Ian. 'But it's not all about price.
It is about quality, service and convenience as well.'
Gross margins fell 0.8 percentage points during the year. But like-for-like
sales (excluding store openings and closures) increased 3.3 per cent, with
inflation accounting for 2 percentage points, plus a 1.3 point volume gain.
Total UK sales increased 10.3 per cent.
Profits were boosted by a Pounds 8.2m contribution from Catteau, the French
supermarket chain acquired last year, on sales of Pounds 280.2m.
Fully-diluted earnings fell from 19.78p to 15.06p a share. A final dividend
of 5.3p lifts the total from 7.1p to 7.75p.
