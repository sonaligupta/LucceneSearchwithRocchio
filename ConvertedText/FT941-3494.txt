FT  16 MAR 94 / Corporate cash rise points to recovery


   By GRAHAM BOWLEY


The liquidity of large UK industrial and commercial companies increased in
the final quarter of last year, confirming the picture of continued
corporate recovery.
Figures yesterday from the Central Statistical Office showed that the
liquidity ratio, which is a ratio of companies' current assets to current
liabilities, rose to 130 per cent at the end of last year, up from from 122
per cent in the third quarter and up from 105 per cent in the fourth quarter
of 1992.
Mr Peter Warburton, chief economist at Robert Fleming, said: 'They confirm
the picture which has been emerging for some time of a corporate sector
happy to accumulate cash.'
He said companies might be reluctant to invest because they were looking for
an unreasonably high rate of return on investment after being over-exposed
to debt in the 1980s. 'At the moment there's no obvious desire by firms to
invest or to acquire, but we may see that soon.'
Mr Kevin Gardiner, UK economist at Morgan Stanley, said: 'These figures show
that the corporate sector is moving further back into cashflow surplus, a
necessary precursor to a revival in capital spending.'
The liquidity ratio of large manufacturers increased to 114 per cent in the
fourth quarter of 1993 from 102 per cent in the third quarter, and the ratio
for large non-manufacturing companies rose to 153 per cent from 151 per
cent.
