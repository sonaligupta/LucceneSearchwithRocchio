FT  11 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Platinum closes at dollars
350.75


Platinum plunged by Dollars 11.25 a troy ounce to close in London last night
at Dollars 350.75 while silver sank 20 cents an ounce to 367.5 cents by the
close. Both metals were affected by turmoil in the gold market and some
aggressive selling by investment funds.
The funds had previously been buyers of silver and platinum in the
expectation that Mr Bill Clinton would win the US presidential election and
that this would bring back small investors to the market, encouraged by the
hope that Mr Clinton's policies would spark economic growth. Platinum and
silver are seen more as industrial than precious metals today, with demand
and prices likely to reflect world economic activity.
When the funds were unsuccessful with attempts to push silver through the
psychologically-important Dollars 4-an-ounce level, they decided to sell
'and everyone joined in', said one dealer.
