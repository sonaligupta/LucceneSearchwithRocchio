FT  27 JAN 94 / Shear makers kept in the fold


   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff


Britain's smallest union has been bailed out by the Trades Union Congress
after threatening to leave because it could not afford the Pounds 18.20
affiliation fee.
The 13-member Sheffield Wool Shear Workers' Union, founded 104 years ago,
decided it no longer wanted to pay the annual fee of Pounds 1.40 a member.
Mr Ray Cutler, the general secretary, who runs the union from his home in
Sheffield, said: 'We never went to any of the TUC meetings and we haven't
got a lot of funds. We decided among ourselves that it wasn't worth it any
more.'
The union, which was once represented in about 12 companies when the
Sheffield steel industry was a global power, now only has members in one
company, Burgon and Ball, which makes hand shears.
The 240-strong west Midlands-based Engineering and Fastener Trade Union was
also threatening to resign because of similar financial problems.
The TUC decided yesterday that it would come to their rescue. Mr Jimmy
Knapp, the TUC president and leader of the RMT transport union, which has
105,000 members, persuaded the general council to set up a fund to pay the
fees of the two unions.
'They are part of our history and it would be sending the wrong signal if we
let them go for the sake of a few pounds,' he said.
Mr Cutler, who said his union had never had a dispute 'in memory' did not
appear to be too worried either way. 'It's the first I've heard of it,' he
said last night.
The TUC has not indicated the size of its fund but it will be hoping that
its intervention will not attract envious glances from other similarly
endowed affiliates.
Listed just above the shearers in the TUC handbook is the slightly more
muscular Scottish Union of Power-Loom Overlookers, membership 55.
