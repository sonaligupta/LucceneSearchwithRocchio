TAIWAN released its most prominent dissident from prison and granted
amnesties to seven other political activists yesterday after revising its
sedition law, Reuter reports from Taipei.
Mr Huang Hwa, 52, a former presidential candidate of the main opposition
Democratic Progressive Party, had been sentenced to 10 years in prison in
December 1990 for demanding that Taiwan declare independence from China.
