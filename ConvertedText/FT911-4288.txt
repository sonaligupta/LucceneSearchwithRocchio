FT  19 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: Sainsbury reinforces debt
status with Dollars 150m deal


   By SIMON LONDON


J. SAINSBURY, the UK food retailer, yesterday became the latest corporate
borrower to tap the international bond market this week with a Dollars 150m
five-year issue.
The bonds carry a coupon of 8 1/2 per cent and were reoffered to investors
at the fixed price of 99.72, where the yield spread over US Treasury bonds
is 72 basis points.
The company's last Eurodollar bond issue was in 1989, a Dollars 150m
seven-year issue launched at a yield spread of 80 basis points over
Treasuries. Since 1989 many corporate yield spreads have widened
significantly. The narrowing of Sainsbury's yield spread reflects the
company's growing following among international investors. Lead managed by
JP Morgan, by late afternoon the deal was trading at 99.45 bid, for a yield
spread of 71 basis points over Treasuries.
The Pounds 100m five-year issue announced on Wednesday by Sears, the UK
retail group, was priced to yield 135 basis points over UK government bonds.
The coupon was set at 12 1/2 per cent and the issue price was 101.95. Both
the Sears and Sainsbury deals include an 'event risk' put option, giving
bondholders the right to sell back to the issuer at par if the company
becomes the subject of a hostile takeover bid.
Most of the Sears bonds were placed by Credit Suisse First Boston, the lead
manager, and Goldman Sachs and Warburg. The three firms reported strong
buying interest from institutions keen to pick up higher-yielding assets,
although retail companies are not favoured by many investment institutions.
The deal traded at 101.80 bid, against full fees of 1 7/8 per cent.
However, the highest yielding bonds of the day were launched by ANZ Banking
Group, which launched a Pounds 60m 10-year subordinated deal priced to yield
225 basis points over the 10 per cent UK government bond maturing 2001.
The issue was lead managed by Goldman Sachs and launched at Pounds 50m but
increased in the face of strong buying interest. ANZ carries A-2 and
single-A credit ratings for subordinated paper respectively from Moody's
Investors Service and Standard & Poor's, the two big US credit rating
agencies. National Westminster bank, which launched Pounds 100m of 10-year
subordinated paper on Monday, is rated Aa and AA2 by the two rating agencies
and paid a yield spread of 135 basis points.
The European Investment Bank also tapped the sterling sector of the market,
selling Pounds 150m of five-year paper in a deal solely underwritten by
Barclays de Zoete Wedd. Participants in the deal reported continued buying
of sterling assets by continental European investors against the background
of a weak D-Mark. By the close of trading, the issuing was bid at around the
fixed reoffer level of 99.62.
Yesterday saw Ecu450m of three-year bonds issued, more new Ecu paper than in
the past three weeks. Credit Local de France came with a Ecu200m offering of
bonds paying a coupon of 9 1/8 per cent lead managed by Paribas. This was
quickly followed by a Ecu250m deal from IMI Bank, the Italian
state-controlled financial institution, with bonds paying a coupon of 9 1/4
per cent.
Both deals were aimed at retail investors and were held at the fixed reoffer
price by the lead managers throughout the day. The progress of the IMI deal
may be slowed by yesterday's announcement that Italy's triple-A credit
rating may be lowered by Moody's. IMI is controlled by the Italian state and
will automatically loose it's top rating if the downgrading proceeds.
GIBRALTAR yesterday made it's debut in the capital markets with a Pounds 50m
domestic bond issue lead managed by BZW. The paper matures in 2005 and was
priced to yield 175 basis points over the 9 1/2 per cent UK government
conversion stock of this maturity.
