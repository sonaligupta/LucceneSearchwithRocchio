FT  30 OCT 93 / International Company News: Nikon blames drop in demand for
Y799m loss


   By EMIKO TERAZONO


NIKON, the Japanese photo-graphic group, has blamed poor demand for cameras
and optical glass for a loss in the first six months to September. A fall in
exports due to the sharp appreciation of the yen also hit results, writes
Emiko Terazono.
Nikon, which paid Y4.5 per share in interim dividends last year, said it
would forego dividend payments.
It reported a non-consolidated pre-tax loss of Y1.6bn (Dollars 14.8m),
against a Y1bn pre-tax profit a year earlier. Sales declined 12.1 per cent
to Y91.6bn, and the after-tax loss was Y799m.
The company expects to return to the black for the year to March.
