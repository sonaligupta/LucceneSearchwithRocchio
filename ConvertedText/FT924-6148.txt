FT  23 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Downturn at F&C German Inv


Foreign & Colonial German Investment Trust reported net asset value lower at
105.2p on September 30, against 110.9p at March 31 and 107.1p a year
earlier.
Mr David Thomson, chairman, said that although Germany performed better than
other European bourses the performance was disappointing. However most of
the falls were offset by sterling's decline against the D-mark.
Net revenue for the six months to the end of September was Pounds 320,000
(Pounds 350,000) for earnings per share of 0.81p (0.89p).
