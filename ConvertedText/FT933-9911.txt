FT  06 AUG 93 / Amic pre-tax down 5% at halfway


   By PHILIP GAWITH


ANGLO AMERICAN Industrial Corporation (Amic) suffered a 5 per cent decline
to R227m (Dollars 67.6m) in pre-tax income from R239m at the halfway stage
as depressed trading conditions took their toll.
But Mr Leslie Boyd, chairman, said there were clear signs that the South
African economy had bottomed out, and he predicted improved earnings in the
second half.
The dividend was maintained at 110 cents a share on per-share earnings
which, including an abnormal credit, rose by 16 per cent to 327 cents from
281 cents.
Turnover at Amic, the industrial arm of the Anglo American group, rose by 18
per cent to R3.86bn, against R3.28bn, but the increase from continuing
operations was only 3 per cent. Earnings from operations fell to R153m from
R170m, largely because of lower earnings at Mondi and Boart, two of Amic's
unlisted subsidiaries.
Mr Boyd said the group restructuring plans were 'fairly well down the road'
and should be completed by the beginning of 1994. The aim was to improve
Amic's borrowing and tax efficiency.
Amic yesterday, for the first time, gave a more detailed presentation on its
main unlisted activities - Mondi, Boart and Scaw Metals.
Attributable earnings at Mondi fell from R172m in 1989 to R51m in 1992.
Over the same period, Boart's earnings fell from R100m to R47m, and were
R12m in the first half of 1993.
