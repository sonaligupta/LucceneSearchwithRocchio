FT  06 JAN 94 / UN staff flee Afghan fighting


   By STEVE LEVINE


   TASHKENT


The United Nations tried to evacuate most of its staff from the northern
Afghanistan city of Mazar-i-Sharif yesterday, as looters robbed its
storehouses and offices amid worsening fighting, Steve LeVine reports from
Tashkent.
The fighting imperilled 18,000 refugees from the ex-Soviet republic of
Tajikistan, living in a UN camp near Mazar-i-Sharif.
In the most widespread fighting in Afghanistan since the Moscow-backed
government fell in April 1992 the violence in Mazar-i-Sharif was an
extension of heated battles going on in the capital, Kabul. The fighting has
been the worst threat faced by the Afghan president, Mr Berhanuddin Rabbani,
a Tajik, in more than a year of rocket attacks on Kabul by ethnic rivals.
