FT  11 APR 94 / Imports anger mushroom growers


   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES


British mushroom prices are being undermined by cheap Irish imports which
has led to about 1,000 job losses since 1988, UK growers say.
The European Commission called on the Irish government to stop illegal tax
breaks for its mushroom growers by the end of last week. It is still
investigating the legality of a Pounds 1.3m market development fund which
was set up to help Irish producers compete after the devaluation of sterling
in 1992.
Mushroom production in the Irish Republic has increased by 92 per cent since
1988 to 43,000 tonnes, with the bulk of this exported to the UK because
mushrooms only have a shelf life of about two days.
British growers estimate that 13 per cent of the Pounds 200m industry's jobs
have been lost in the past six years as prices have dropped to just below
Pounds 1,000 per tonne from about Pounds 1,300 a tonne in 1988.
Mr Ken James, who runs the British Mushroom Growers Association, said:
'We're concerned about the amount of production generated by aid to the
Irish industry where they've been expanding beyond the market's capa-city.'
Increases in Irish production are part of a larger structural surplus within
the European Union. British mushroom growers wrote to the commission last
week to warn of the crisis facing the EU industry and asking for imports
from countries outside the EU to be restricted.
'The English industry spent millions of pounds in promoting mushrooms in the
1980s and now it has lost 35 per cent of its market share to Irish imports,'
one grower said. A promotional campaign in the 1980s succeeded in doubling
UK consumption.
Mr Miles Warnick at Chesswood Produce, one of the UK's biggest growers, said
that producers are finding it difficult to compete with the cheaper Irish
mushrooms. 'Last year I closed two of my farms and made 120 people redundant
because I just can't compete,' he said.
