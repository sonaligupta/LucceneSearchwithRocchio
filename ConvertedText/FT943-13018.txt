FT  21 JUL 94 / People: Hoare Govett


Hoare Govett, the UK stockbroker which now belongs to ABN Amro, the Dutch
Bank, has hired Ishbel Macpherson, a 30-something director of corporate
finance at BZW, to shake up its smaller company corporate finance
activities.
Hoare's senior management need not worry too much about its latest recruit
swanning off on maternity leave at the drop of a hat. In an interview with
The Independent four years ago, Macpherson affectionately described children
as 'repellent little buggers' for whom she would be loath to sacrifice her
career in the City.
Hoare will presumably hope that Macpherson shows a little more gentleness
towards the entrepreneurs who are seeking ways to make their fledgling
companies grow.
Gareth Jones, ABBEY NATIONAL'S group treasurer, has assumed control of its
European operations from Charles Toner, md retail.
Tony Stradmoor, formerly general manager of Kobayashi & Co, is appointed a
director of Martin Bierbaum, another TRIO HOLDINGS subsidiary.
Jonathan Lubran, formerly chief executive of Bankers Trust Investment
Management, has been appointed md of FOREIGN & COLONIAL's institutional
marketing division; he and Fred Packard, chairman of Foreign & Colonial
Emerging Markets, have been appointed to the F&C Management board.
Gordon McKechnie has been appointed director of project advisory at NATWEST
Markets; he moves from JP Morgan.
Edward Bonham Carter, formerly a director of Electra Kingsway, has been
appointed a director of JUPITER TYNDALL MERLIN.
John Brakell, a founder director of Granville Private Equity Managers, has
been appointed to the board of GRANVILLE HOLDINGS.
