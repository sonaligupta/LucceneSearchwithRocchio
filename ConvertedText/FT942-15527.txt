FT  14 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper fails to break
resistance - Market Report


   By REUTER


COPPER flattered to deceive at the London Metal Exchange yesterday afternoon
when the three months delivery position briefly snapped above Dollars 1,900
a tonne. But prices were back in the well-worn Dollars 1,880-1,900 band at
the close of the after hours 'kerb' session.
'It looked like it might find the stops (stop-loss buying orders) above
there (Dollars 1,900), but with so little business around it just failed,'
one dealer explained.
Copper's setback rubbed off on the ALUMINIUM market, which eased back
towards the day's lows on late liquidation, although the market continued to
be supported by Chinese interest.
The LEAD market made another attempt to move above Dollars 470 a tonne for
three months delivery in the afternoon, but again lacked follow-through,
slipping back below that technically-significant level to end unchanged on
the day at Dollars 468 a tonne.
ZINC, bereft of fundamental support, was unable to build on Tuesday's upward
movement, and the three months position finished at Dollars 961 a tonne,
down Dollars 6.50.
