FT  20 APR 91 / Building society chiefs' pay enters a super-league


   By RICHARD WATERS


BUILDING society bosses have discovered the world of serious money.
Mr Andrew Longhurst, chief executive of Cheltenham & Gloucester, saw his
earnings jump by 48 per cent in 1990 to Pounds 265,079. That kept him at the
top of the earnings league for building society chief executives, and almost
within spitting distance of investment bankers, who are the financial
world's biggest earners.
The earnings of two other society chief executives moved above Pounds
200,000 last year - one of the toughest on record for the UK mortgage
market.
Mr David O'Brien of National & Provincial was paid Pounds 205,000, having
taken over as chief executive of the society only in July. That was 59 per
cent more than had been paid to his predecessor for the whole of 1989. Mr
Scott Durward of Alliance & Leicester enjoyed a more modest pay increase of
23 per cent to take him into the new super-league.
Big pay rises were also evident further down the scale. Mr Tony FitzSimons
of Bristol and West had a 42 per cent pay rise, taking him to Pounds
161,668, while the earnings of Mr Derek Roberts of Yorkshire jumped by 30
per cent to Pounds 131,000.
The figures are taken from the latest annual reports of the societies. In
all cases, the chief executives are the highest paid directors in their
respective societies - unlike other industries, where star salesmen or
bosses of highly profitable subsidiaries can earn more than the group chief.
The boardrooms of UK building societies, traditionally among the most staid
in the financial sector, are apparently succumbing to this rash of big pay
rises for two reasons.
First, bonus-related pay has increased in building societies in recent
years, accounting for the big pay rises at C&G and Bristol and West. C&G's
profits rose by 35 per cent last year and Bristol and West's by 30 per cent
in a tough year for the industry. Around 60 per cent of Mr Longhurst's
salary was profit-related. His basic salary, C&G says, rose by just 10 per
cent. That compares with rises of 12 per cent or more for 75 per cent of the
society's staff.
Second, executives from outside the industry have joined building society
boards, bringing different pay expectations. The outstanding example is Mr
O'Brien at National & Provincial, who previously ran Rank Xerox's UK
operations. It is not clear how much of his pay related to his services in
the last six months of 1990, and how much was a one-off payment linked with
the move.
By comparison with the new big earners, the pay of some of the mortgage
world's top bosses seems low.
Mr Jim Birrell, for instance, who runs Halifax, the biggest society, earned
Pounds 152,504 in 1989 (Halifax, with a January year-end, has yet to
disclose what he was paid last year). Mr Peter Birch of Abbey National, a
building society until two years ago, received a 1 per cent pay rise to
Pounds 191,806 last year.
Even the new super-earners pale in comparison with Mr Richard Lacy. As chief
executive of National Home Loans, a specialist mortgage company, he was paid
Pounds 425,000 in 1989, before resigning last summer.
