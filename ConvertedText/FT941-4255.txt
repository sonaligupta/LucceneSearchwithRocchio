FT  11 MAR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool


New Zealand was the outstandingly strong wool market this week, with a
complete clearance and prices rising by 10pc or more compared with a strong
and dearer sale last week. Crossbred wool is now recognised as likely to be
in short supply in the months ahead, and some traders are believed to be
oversold. A surge in Chinese buying set off the latest rise, coupled with a
market background already increasing in strength. China also played a part
in what happened at Australian wool sales, with medium and broader Merinos
and crossbreds appreciably dearer while finer Merinos, previously favoured,
tended to level out. So far there are only some signs of better business
experienced by processors and manufacturers, accompanying the wool market
rise. The official Wool International Australian market indicator was
546c/kg on Wednesday.
