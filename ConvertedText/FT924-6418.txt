FT  21 NOV 92 / Swiss bank chief rejects criticism


   By IAN RODGER


   ZURICH


Mr Markus Lusser, president of the Swiss National Bank, has rejected
criticism by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) of the central bank's monetary policy, Ian Rodger writes from Zurich.
'The significant fall in inflation confirms that our way is right,' Mr
Lusser said in a speech in Basle. Swiss inflation has declined steadily from
a peak of 6.6 per cent in mid-1991 to to 3.5 per cent last month.
The OECD said in its annual survey of the Swiss economy, published last
week, that the SNB's policy leads to confusion in financial markets about
exchange rate and monetary policy objectives.
