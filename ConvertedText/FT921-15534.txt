FT  09 JAN 92 / Observer: Battle stations


With three months to go before the tenth anniversary of the Falklands War,
Britain's Channel 4 has fired the opening shot in what looks like being a
fierce ratings battle. The subject - the most comprehensive account of
Britain's conflict with Argentina . . . and there could be casualties.
Channel 4, whose four-part documentary starts next Monday, has Admiral Sir
Henry Leach, a former sea lord, accusing former defence minister Sir John
Knott of 'making a howling cock-up' of defence policy in the run-up to the
war.
In order to spike the opposition's guns it has taken the precaution of
getting agreement from a host of retired admirals, generals, and senior
diplomats, including former UN ambassador Sir Nicholas Henderson, not to
talk to any other channel until after the anniversary.
Nevertheless, at least another four Falklands programmes are planned by the
rival channels in what could prove to be a scheduling nightmare in an
election year. The BBC is not taking up the suggestion of Sir Bernard
Ingham, Mrs Thatcher's former press secretary, to screen a pro-Thatcher
Falklands play.
Meanwhile, details of Mrs Thatcher's role in the anniversary celebrations
remain under wraps. She refused to sign any contract with Channel 4.
Wouldn't it be interesting if she resurfaced on the Beeb?
