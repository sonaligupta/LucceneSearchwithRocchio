FT  29 APR 94 / Observer: Joy less


New heights in sophisticated advertising have been scaled by a firm of
London solicitors, Maurice Cohen & Co. Specialists in immigration law, the
firm has taken a poster site directly opposite the immigration offices in
Croydon. 'No Joy?' the poster asks rhetorically. It then explains that
anyone having trouble should call the firm for legal advice.
Trouble is, the most notorious deportation case in the public gaze in
Britain today concerns Joy Gardner, who died in December 1993 after being
manhandled by police serving her with a deportation notice. The police
involved have now been charged with manslaughter.
'It's not meant to be a reference to Joy Gardner,' says Maurice Cohen,
adding that the agency responsible for the 'eye-catching' ad is called Hype.
