FT  28 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Recession restricts Greggs to Pounds 2.29m


   By CHRIS TIGHE


GREGGS, the Newcastle upon Tyne-based manufacturer and retailer of bread,
confectionery and savory products, returned profits of Pounds 2.29m before
tax for the 24 weeks ended June 13.
That was a 2 per cent improvement on last time's Pounds 2.24m and was scored
on the back of a 4 per cent increase in turnover to Pounds 45.3m, helped by
the opening of nine new shops.
A small decrease in volume sales through existing stores reflected the
impact of the recession.
A more positive trend in sales and profits identified by the company in the
first five months of the year was not sustained after Easter.
Mr Mike Darrington, managing director, said he was confident about the
medium and long term future but he did not expect the recession to end 'in
the very near term.'
At the half year end Greggs was trading from 482 outlets. In spite of a
Pounds 1.25m cutback in planned investment to Pounds 6.25m the group
expected to open a further eight new shops and close one during the
remainder of the year.
'We are investing in the future,' said Mr Darring-ton.
Apart from the recession, Greggs suffered from the impact of Sunday trading,
to which it was firmly opposed, and massive expansion by supermarket
competitors.
Interest income for the opening 24 weeks fell from Pounds 232,000 to Pounds
166,000, mainly reflecting lower interest rates.
The interim dividend is lifted by 5.3 per cent to 5p from static earnings of
13.4p.
