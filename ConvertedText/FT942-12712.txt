FT  28 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: No reason why savings should not be
delivered (2)


   From Mr STEPHEN J JONES


Sir, The conclusions of the Cabinet Office report on the apparent lack of
value delivered by external consultancies to government departments are
disturbing. However, many of the pitfalls in the procurement of consultancy
services can easily be avoided if the purchaser and supplier mutually agree,
prior to commencement of the project, the scope, risks, dependencies and
measureable benefits to be delivered. Value for money is a prime concern,
and fee structures based on the financial savings achieved are being offered
by the more progressive consultancies.
It is also sound practice for the client to work in partnership with the
consultancy through to implementation in order to ensure fast delivery of
agreed benefits rather than have the client struggle with implementation
after the consultancy has withdrawn.
There is no reason why external intervention should not provide very
significant financial benefits if the consultancy chosen for the work has a
strong track record in achieving defined objectives. References should be
taken up wherever possible. Consultancies which cannot demonstrate such
expertise are best avoided.
