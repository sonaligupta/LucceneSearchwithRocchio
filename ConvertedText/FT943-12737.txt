FT  23 JUL 94 / Seoul watches Hyundai strike


   By JOHN BURTON


   SEOUL


The South Korean government has decided not to intervene immediately in a
strike at Hyundai Heavy Industries' shipyard, which has emerged as the
country's biggest industrial dispute this year. The month-long strike at
HHI, which has resulted in sales losses of Dollars 240m (Pounds 155m),
stands in sharp contrast to the rapid settlement of other industrial
disputes this year as labour militancy wanes in South Korea. The HHI workers
are demanding a 12.6 per cent pay rise and an increase in other benefits,
which would boost wage costs by Dollars 1.3bn for its 22,000 employees,
according to the company. HHI workers are occupying shipyard facilities
after the company announced a lock-out earlier this week. Officials warn,
however, that the government could order the ejection of the workers from
the shipyard if the strike threatens to spread to other companies in the
Hyundai group, Korea's largest industrial conglomerate.
