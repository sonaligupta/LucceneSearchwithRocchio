FT  14 APR 94 / Observer: Party-pooper


Appearances can be deceptive. Yasushi Akashi, the top UN civilian in former
Yugoslavia, from whom General Sir Michael Rose takes his orders, is not a
typically faceless Japanese bureaucrat.
Indeed, he has taken to showing visitors to his Zagreb office a letter from
John Major, in which the British PM thanks him for the convivial evening
they spent together last month in Split. 'In future when I want a good
Churchill anecdote, I shall know where to turn,' the letter concludes. What
can he have meant? Sadly, Akashi refuses to unlock his fund of Churchill
stories 'in mixed company'.
When a female colleague protested that little shocked her after several
years in Yugoslavia, Akashi smiled evasively. 'Perhaps after a few drinks,'
he said. What's Japanese for party-pooper?
