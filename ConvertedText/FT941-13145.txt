FT  27 JAN 94 / Production of oil hits a 5-year high


   By ROBERT CORZINE


North Sea oil production in December reached its highest level since the
disaster which destroyed the Piper Alpha platform in 1988, according to
figures published yesterday by Royal Bank of Scot-land.
December production of 2.33m barrels a day was about 1 per cent up from the
figure for November.
Fourth quarter production registered a 14 per cent rise over the same period
in 1992 as new fields came on stream.
Oil production for 1993 as a whole reached a five-year high. Gas production
averaging 6,255m cu ft a day reached a three-year high. Buoyant gas prices
helped to boost the average daily revenue from North Sea oil and gas
production last year to Pounds 33.5m, a 13 per cent increase from the 1992
average of Pounds 29.7m.
Average daily oil revenues rose by 8 per cent to Pounds 22.4m in spite of
the fall in the price of the benchmark Brent blend from about Dollars 20 a
barrel at the start of last year to the present level of about Dollars 14 a
barrel.
Ms Jo Armstrong, a bank economist, noted that the oil price decline was
particularly steep towards the end of the year, with daily oil revenues in
December falling by just under 10 per cent to Pounds 21.4bn.
