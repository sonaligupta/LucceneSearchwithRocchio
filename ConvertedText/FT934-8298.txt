FT  16 NOV 93 / International Company News: US Pru to partially float
reinsurance unit


   By RICHARD WATERS


   NEW YORK


THE PRUDENTIAL, the US insurer, plans to retain a majority stake in its
reinsurance arm in a partial flotation that would value the unit at more
than Dollars 1bn.
The company, which earlier this year pursued a private sale of the whole
unit, said it would sell 20m of Prudential Reinsurance's 50m shares in a
public offering, 4m of them outside the US. An over-allotment provision
allows for the sale of a further 3m shares.
The Prudential abandoned its pursuit of a private sale in August after it
was unable to raise the Dollars 1.2bn target sale price.
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said it
would sell the shares at a maximum of Dollars 21 each, putting proceeds from
the offering at Dollars 420m and the value of the unit at Dollars 1.05bn.
By floating the company while keeping a majority interest, the Prudential
will be able to value its holding as an investment, helping to boost its
capital position.
This echoes moves by other insurers to boost their capital ratios ahead of
the year-end introduction of standardised risk-based capital rules for the
US insurance industry.
The Prudential said it wanted to sell more shares in the unit after the
flotation.
