FT  27 JAN 94 / Talks continue on Mirror claim


   By JOHN MASON


Talks aimed at reaching an out-of-court settlement over the Pounds 175m
legal claim by Mirror Group Newspaper pension fund trustees against three
securities houses continued yesterday, John Mason writes.
The trustees are seeking the return of assets and damages from Invesco MIM,
Capel-Cure Myers Management and Lehman Brothers International over their
handling of pension fund assets controlled by the late Mr Robert Maxwell.
The High Court trial due to start yesterday was postponed for a second time
to give lawyers more time to reach agreement. The hearing was adjourned to
Monday.
