FT  25 AUG 92 / Financial sector wins 17% of market


   By PETER MARSH


UK FINANCIAL institutions account for 17 per cent of the world market in
financial services, according to the institute's review, Peter Marsh writes.
Professor Tony Smith says the British share is second only to that of US
institutions, which account for 66.3 per cent of the market.
Japanese-owned institutions have 5.1 per cent, with French, Canadian and
Swiss groups accounting for 4.2 per cent, 3.2 per cent and 2.1 per cent
respectively.
Prof Smith bases his analysis on fees earned by commercial and merchant
banks in 1989, in areas such as foreign exchange dealing, mergers and
acquisitions, bonds and equities.
Behind the success of UK-owned financial groups, says Prof Smith, is their
'inherent efficiency'. This factor is 'difficult to identify and quantify
directly', but has been helped by competitive forces.
Both the UK and the US have 'basically open, unprotected domestic financial
markets and a consequent exposure of national financial institutions to
untrammelled international competition'.
Prof Smith says that many financial groups from continental Europe lack
these advantages.
He adds that the honing of British groups' competitive capabilities 'has not
been without cost'. Rivals from other nations, especially the US, have
frequently won substantial shares in UK markets 'to the point where in some
case the UK experiences a deficit in supply'.
