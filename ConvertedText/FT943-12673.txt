FT  23 JUL 94 / UK Company News: GKN helicopter compensation hopes rise


   By TIM BURT


Westland, the GKN subsidiary, has moved a step closer towards winning a cash
settlement from the Arab Organisation for Industrialisation over cancelled
orders for up to 250 helicopters.
The group's hopes were lifted after Mr Justice Colman, the commercial court
judge, granted an application by the helicopter manufacturer to extract
compensation from the AOI's UK-held bank accounts.
The move follows a 14-year battle between the AOI - representing the
governments of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates - and
Westland, the subject of a hostile takeover by GKN earlier this year.
Proceedings first began following the Camp David peace treaty in 1979, which
prompted the AOI to abandon plans to buy Westland helicopters built under
licence in Egypt. Lawyers acting for Westland have been seeking compensation
from the AOI since June last year, when it was awarded Pounds 385m damages
following arbitration proceedings in Geneva.
The group has so far recovered Pounds 25m from AOI accounts in the US and
Pounds 115m in France, leaving Pounds 245m plus interest outstanding. The
AOI is expected to appeal; GKN said it was exploring ways of reaching a
amicable settlement.
