   NEW YORK


A long-running dispute over work practises between Caterpillar nd the United
Auto Workers escalated yesterday when a walk-out by union members in
Illinois spread to 11 other facilities in three states, Frank McGurty
reports from New York. The UAW, which represents 14,500 Caterpillar workers,
said the walk-out was called after the US heavy equipment manufacturer took
disciplinary action against a UAW official.
