FT  26 MAY 93 / Beijing blacklists 3,000 polluters

   BEIJING


THE Chinese government has blacklisted 3,000 companies judged to be the
country's worst polluters, Reuter reports from Beijing.
The companies belched out 60 per cent of China's measured industrial waste,
soot and other pollutants, the official news agency Xinhua said.
'If major efforts are made for the control of environmental problems caused
by the 3,000 enterprises, China will be much cleaner,' it said.
Among offenders were big state-run enterprises such as Anshan Iron and Steel
and the Daqing General Industrial Petrochemical Plant. The agency did not
say what action would be taken against companies on the blacklist.
Environmental pollution is a growing problem as China's economy expands,
presenting the government with a dilemma of development versus public
health.
