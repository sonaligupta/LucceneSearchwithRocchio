FT  27 JAN 94 / UK Company News: OFT talks halt TV bid clock


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


The battle for the future of London Weekend Television may not now be
resolved until the beginning of March, writes Raymond Snoddy.
Yesterday should have seen Granada's final extension of its offer of six new
shares for five LWT shares but talks were continuing with the Office of Fair
Trading with the takeover clock stopped.
The OFT is exploring with all parties involved what the future shape of
advertising sales houses, owned or influenced by Granada or LWT, should be.
Granada owns a 50 per cent stake in The Time Exchange which sells airtime
for Granada, Scottish, Border and Ulster. LWT owns Laser which sells airtime
for LWT and Yorkshire-Tyne Tees.
If the two were combined it would amount to a 40 per cent share of the
market.
It may be as late as February 10 before the issue is resolved between the
OFT and the Department of Trade and Industry and the takeover clock starts
ticking.
Once the clock is started again LWT will have two days to put out any new
information and then the final closing date would follow 21 days after that.
