FT  27 JAN 94 / International Company News: Moulinex secures draft rescue
package


   By ALICE RAWSTHORN


Moulinex, the troubled French household electricals group, yesterday saw its
shares rise sharply on the Paris stock market after announcing that it had
agreed draft proposals for a financial rescue package.
The company's shares soared to close FFr9 better at FFr128. Moulinex was
also buoyed by the announcement that it came close to break even in the nine
months to December 31.
Moulinex, badly affected by economic recession and debts incurred by its
1991 acquisition of Krups, the German kitchen appliances manufacturer, fell
into the red during its last financial year and has reported an interim net
loss of FFr161m (Dollars 27.3m) for the six months to September 30.
It has put together a provisional rescue package after months of
negotiations. The plan involves a FFr650m capital increase for Finap, the
holding company that controls 40.2 per cent of Moulinex. The capital will
come from a number of investors including Glen Dimplex, the Irish group
behind the Morphy Richards electrical brand, and Finamex, a partnership
formed to invest the money left by Mr Jean Mantelet, the Moulinex founder.
The restructuring of Finap would be followed by a FFr600m capital increase
for Moulinex to reduce that company's debt. However, Mr Gilbert Torelli,
managing director in charge of the rescue, cautioned that the plan was still
at a provisional stage and could take several months to finalise.
