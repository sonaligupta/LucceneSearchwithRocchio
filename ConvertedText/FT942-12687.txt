FT  28 APR 94 / UK Company News: Fleming Indian raises Pounds 59m in placing
stage


   By BETHAN HUTTON


The Fleming Indian Investment Trust, the first UK-listed investment trust to
specialise in India, has raised about Pounds 59m in the placing stage of its
launch.
A further 90.8m shares at 100p each - with warrants attached on a 1-for-5
basis - are available through a public offer, closing on May 18.
The trust's target is to raise about Pounds 100m. However, recent investment
trust launches have tended to receive a fairly small proportion of their
total from private investors.
The fund will be managed from Hong Kong by the team already responsible for
the JF India unit trust, a Hong Kong-listed fund run by Jardine Fleming, the
sister company of Fleming Investment Management. Jardine Fleming also has 18
analysts in Bombay.
The UK fund will be invested via Mauritius, to take advantage of the tax
treaty between Mauritius and India.
