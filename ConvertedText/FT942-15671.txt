FT  14 APR 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Cranfield's
'marketing excellent' companies


One of the 'marketing excellent' companies selected by Cranfield was Land
Rover, part of the Rover Group. Everyone who buys a Discovery (above),
Defender or Range Rover gets a telephone call or a postal questionnaire
asking about the product and service they have received.
The boundaries between engineering and marketing are being blurred through
training: recruits are expected to have practical experience of assembling
work, as well as marketing. Even Land Rover's security man in the UK, on
duty over Christmas, was able to deal with a Defender driver stranded in
Croatia. An ex-sapper himself, he arranged for spare parts to be despatched
and talked the driver through their fitting.
The other companies studied for the report are: In the service sector:
Allied Dunbar; British Airways; British Telecommunications; Rentokil;
Standard Life. In consumer manufacturing: Black & Decker; Boots Healthcare
International; Johnson & Johnson; SmithKline Beecham; Sony (UK); In
industrial manufacturing and distribution: AT&T Global Information
Solutions; Electrospeed; Renishaw; Rolls-Royce Aero Engines.
