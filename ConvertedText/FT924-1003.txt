FT  21 DEC 92 / Italy prepares to give privatisation details


   By ROBERT GRAHAM and EDWARD BALLS


   ROME


THE Italian government is expected this week to publish full details of its
privatisation programme, after the broad endorsement last week from the two
houses of parliament.
Approval was given by the chamber of deputies on Wednesday and the senate on
Friday to a programme which aims to raise L27,000bn (Pounds 12.8bn) for the
treasury between 1993 and 1995. In addition IRI, the state holding company,
is expected to raise some L12,000bn from its own divestments which will go
to recapitalise and repay debts.
Parliamentary backing came despite powerful lobbying by Christian Democrat
and Socialist politicians on their own coalition to water down the scheme so
that the parties could retain control over a large state-controlled economy.
'This is an important step forward,' a treasury official said.
Italian economic growth will begin to accelerate towards the end of next
year if the government succeeds in bringing the fiscal deficit under control
while keeping the lid on wage inflation, the OECD said yesterday, writes
Edward Balls. The OECD expects Italy's economic growth rate to slip to 0.8
per cent next year. But an export- and investment-led recovery should
deliver a 1.7 per cent growth rate in 1994.
