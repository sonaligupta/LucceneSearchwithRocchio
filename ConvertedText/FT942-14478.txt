FT  20 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Pechiney


Last year's full-year loss shows why Pechiney has not been in the vanguard
of French privatisation. While investors have been offered shares in other
cyclical companies, privatising the aluminium group while it is loss-making
would be politically sensitive.
That logic may explain Pechiney's enthusiasm for its proposed merger with
Compagnie Nationale du Rhone, the electricity generator. In addition to
making earnings less volatile, an early deal might help Pechiney report a
profit this year and open the way for privatisation.
In other respects, though, merger with CNR might harm Pechiney's case.
Adding utility earnings to the mix would dilute the group's recovery
potential just as aluminium prices are starting to turn. In an era of
demergers, international investors in particular could view the exercise as
unnecessary. Pechiney's previous attempts at diversification have not
changed its essentially cyclical nature. A large part of Pechiney's swing
into loss arose from problems at American National Can, acquired in 1988 as
part of a wider move into packaging.
Without CNR, Pechiney's prospects turn on action now being taken to relieve
overcapacity. The aluminium price will only sustain its recent rise if cuts
promised by large producers are seen to stick. The timing of recovery is
thus uncertain. But that should not in itself be a hurdle to eventual
privatisation if Pechiney has the patience to wait.
