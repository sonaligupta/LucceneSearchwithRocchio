FT  16 DEC 94 / Lloyd's plans rise in motor insurance


   By RALPH ATKINS


Motor underwriters at Lloyd's of London are investigating the feasibility of
a joint body to increase the number of policies sold by the insurance market
to drivers, Ralph Atkins writes.
Lloyd's syndicates account for about 15 per cent of the private car
insurance market but trade as individual organisations under different
names. This means potential customers contacting Lloyd's central
organisation cannot be passed direct to underwriters, said Mr Peter
Routledge, chairman of a Lloyd's Motor Underwriters' Association working
party.
Competition is also intensifying in the private motor insurance market with
companies such as the Royal Bank of Scotland's Direct Line increasing their
market share by selling over the telephone.
Any joint Lloyd's scheme would have to overcome the problem of deciding how
potential customers should be allocated to different syndicates.
