FT  19 APR 94 / Engineers set to cut 40,000 jobs


   By ANDREW BAXTER


The engineering industry is likely to shed a further 40,000 jobs in the next
12 months in spite of a forecast rise in output, the Engineering Employers
Federation said yesterday.
The cuts will come on top of 400,000 in the industry since 1990, reducing
the workforce by 19 per cent to 1.7m. The federation says 30,000 jobs went
last year, but the underlying trend is down sharply from cuts of 120,000 to
130,000 in each of the three previous years.
The employment forecast was part of a cautiously optimistic assessment of
the outlook in the federation's twice-yearly economic trends report. After a
temporary dip at the end of 1993, engineering output is set to rise again at
a gradually accelerating rate, it says.
Mr Graham Mackenzie, the federation's acting director-general, said the
engineering sector was at a turning point after the recession. The
federation's statistics, along with other evidence, were all 'pretty
positive'.
The federation's forecast coincided with an upbeat report from the Machine
Tool Technologies Association following last week's Metcut '94 exhibition in
Birmingham.
Mr Stan Vaughan, president of the association, said: 'Recovery in the
machine tool industry is clearly taking place.'
The Engineering Employers' Federation makes clear that, although output is
beginning to recover, the forecast growth will not be sufficient to maintain
employment levels in the industry.
It predicts that engineering output will rise 3 per cent in the 18 months
from the second half of 1993 to the first half of 1995. But, with
productivity increasing by 4 per cent to 5 per cent a year, output would
have to rise by the same amount just to keep employment stable.
For engineering employment to grow, output would need to rise by 6 per cent
to 7 per cent a year, which would not be sustainable for any length of time,
said Mr Mackenzie.
Within the engineering industry, the federation expects a similar pattern in
the next 18 months as in the period from the first half of 1992 to the
second half of 1993, with strong growth in electronics and vehicles offset
by a continuing fall in aerospace output.
Mr Ian Thompson, economic adviser, also warned that the UK trade deficit
might worsen if the UK began a recovery led by consumer spending, while
continental Europe, which accounts for 60 per cent of UK trade in
engineering products, is recovering only slowly from the recession.
He said an upturn in UK investment spending would be the key to cyclical
recovery for the engineering industry. Fixed investment fell 26 per cent
from the beginning of 1990 to the end of 1993, and based on historical data
a recovery is long overdue.
Mr Thompson forecasts a steady rise in fixed investment in manufacturing and
non-manufacturing sectors over the next 18 months. This had been borne out
by the improved sentiment at Metcut. Mr Vaughan said manufacturers were
taking new orders all week and the level of genuine inquiries had been
'almost overwhelming'.
