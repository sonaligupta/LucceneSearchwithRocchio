FT  11 APR 92 / Afghan rebels reject UN peace proposal

   ISLAMABAD


HARDLINE Afghan guerrilla leaders yesterday rejected UN-brokered plans for a
new ruling council to take power in Afghanistan as the first step towards
ending the 14-year civil war, Reuter reports from Islamabad.
But their host, Pakistan, welcomed the United Nations move to set up the
council and appealed to all Afghans to join the peace process.
UN Secretary-General Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali announced in Geneva earlier
yesterday that agreement had been reached to set up a 15-member council to
take power from President Najibullah's government in Kabul. The council is
to precede an interim government.
There was no comment from the Kabul government or moderate guerrilla
representatives but hardline guerrilla chiefs condemned the proposal.
'Any government made by any foreign agency will not be tolerated even for a
moment,' main hardline guerrilla leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar said.
'We completely reject this council,' Ittehad-i-Islami party leader Abdurrab
Rasul Sayyaf and Hezb-i-Islami (Khalis) party leader Younus Khalis said.
They said the Afghan people would not accept any government imposed on them
except one of Mujahideen guerrillas. Sayyaf is the prime minister of a
divided guerrilla government based in Pakistan in which Khalis is the
interior minister.
There was no immediate comment from the rebel government's moderate
President Sibghatullah Mojaddidi, who supports the UN plan.
The ruling Watan (homeland) Party said in Kabul the council would include
former ministers, exiled intellectuals and bureaucrats.
Mr Boutros-Ghali said the council would be composed of impartial
personalities. 'We have reached an agreement in principle to have a
pre-transitional council of 15 members in Kabul which will take power now.
This is the first step of reconciliation,' he said.
