FT  06 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei declines 1.9% and
leads rest of region lower

   TOKYO


ARBITRAGE selling and margin liquidation depressed share prices and the
Nikkei 225 lost 1.9 per cent, falling for the fourth consecutive trading
day, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index dropped 359.33 to 18,590.46, losing 5.6 per cent on the week,
having opened at the day's high of 18,941.69, and plunged to a low of
18,470.35 in early trading.
Afternoon buying by institutional investors lifted the Nikkei briefly, but
late afternoon arbitrage unwinding pushed share prices lower.
Volume swelled to 430m shares on active selling, up from Thursday's 252m.
Losers outnumbered gainers by 938 to 114 with 100 unchanged, the Topix index
of all first section stocks fell 23.23, or 1.4 per cent to 1,580.85 and, in
London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 1.04 to 1265.11.
The absence of public fund support discouraged investors. Comments by Mr
Hirohisa Fujii, the finance minister, indicating the government's reluctance
to take immediate action to support the stock market, also added to the
pessimism. East Japan Railway met continued profit taking, declining Y7,000
to Y485,000, while Nippon Telegraph and Telephone retreated Y19,000 to
Y810,000.
Margin-linked selling depressed Keisei Electric Railway Y24 to Y868.
Sumitomo Metal Mining, which also met margin unwinding selling in the
morning session, found support in the afternoon, closing up Y5 to Y808.
Banks were lower on index-linked selling. Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y10
to Y3,320 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Y50 to Y2,320. Some consumer electronics
companies were higher on bargain hunting. Sony rose Y20 to Y4,950 and
Pioneer Electronic by Y50 to Y2,770.
In Osaka, the OSE average plunged 438.40 to 20,801.29 in volume of 23.2m
shares.
Roundup
THE region reacted nervously to the falls in Toyko and the US. Mr Jonathan
Compton, divisional director at Credit Lyonnais Asia in London, commented
that the markets had not required much of an excuse to correct from high
levels, finding this in the rise of US long bond rates and the Nikkei's fall
through the 19,000 level.
HONG KONG fell 2.3 per cent, taking the Hang Seng Index marginally below the
9,000 level, though late bargain hunting helped it to recover some of its
early losses.
The index tumbled 207.95 to 8,996.93, after an intraday low of 8,834.69, for
a three-day decline of 640 points and a 3.6 per cent fall over the week.
The weakness was attributed to lingering profit-taking by US and European
institutions which led the bourse's recent record-breaking rally. However,
analysts noted that shrinking turnover indicated that market was not
undergoing a full-scale sell-off. Preliminary turnover dwindled to HKDollars
6.76bn from Thursday's HKDollars 7.39bn.
SINGAPORE gave up 2.6 per cent with trading limits imposed on retail clients
by some brokerages putting an additional restraint on activity. The Straits
Times Industrials index fell 55.13 to 2,068.72, a 1.6 per cent fall on the
week. Singapore Telecom rose 2 cents to SDollars 3.86 on institutional
buying.
KUALA LUMPUR took its cue from weaker overseas markets and the composite
index closed down 32.12 or 3.3 per cent at 944.94, for a 2.8 per cent
decline on the week.
MANILA fell sharply for the second day in succession as PLDT lost another
Dollars 1.37 to Dollars 61.62 in overnight New York trading, and then 30
pesos to 1,825 pesos. The composite index retreated 35.42 to 2,411.32, up
1.6 per cent over the week. TAIWAN's profit-taking continued especially in
speculative stocks. The weighted index, having opened up 41 points, ended
down 14.55 at 4,246.01 in turnover of TDollars 40.8bn, a week's rise of 3.9
per cent.
AUSTRALIA remained weak and the All Ordinaries index shed 21.7 to 2,079.9 in
turnover of ADollars 471.8m. The index has lost 1.6 per cent over the week.
Turnover was ADollars 471.8m.
Foster's Brewing was the heaviest traded stock in volume of 6.5m shares, the
shares losing 5 cents to ADollars 1.51.
SEOUL was one of the few markets in the region to show a rise on the day.
The composite index added 6.75 to 773.30, a week's gain of 4 per cent, in
turnover of Won1,000bn.
NEW ZEALAND recovered some ground in late trading and the NZSE-40 index
finished off 10.98 at 2,175.21.
BOMBAY advanced in speculative after-hours trading in a continuation of the
trend which built up in the last few minutes of the official session. The
BSE index added 29.65 to 2,664.72.
