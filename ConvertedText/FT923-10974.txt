FT  28 JUL 92 / Training bills for job leavers


   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff


NEARLY one third of British companies have asked people leaving their jobs
to repay the cost of their training.
A majority of managers believe job leavers should repay part or all the
costs of their training, according to the magazine Personnel Today.
Some 28 per cent of companies taking part in the survey conducted by the
Industrial Society had such policies, while a further 8 per cent were
considering it. Overall 55 per cent of managers favoured the idea, and only
26 per cent ruled it out.
The government has estimated that employers spend about Pounds 20bn a year
on training. The Civil Service, for example, spends around Pounds 788 per
employee on training, a figure that is probably higher than the private
sector.
Mr Michael Howard, the former employment secretary, had mooted the idea of
employees having legally enforceable contracts which would allow their
employers to recoup some of their training costs.
However, the suggestion was dropped after informal consultation with
employers.
