FT  30 MAR 92 / Survey of Lloyd's of London in World Insurance (8): Acts of
God and of man - A crescendo of disasters has hit the market


   By TREVOR PETCH


WITH A wry smile, Lloyd's deputy chairman, Dick Hazell, readily concedes
that the unprecedented worldwide string of natural catastrophe and other
large insured losses which began with the October 1987 storms in southern
England have been 'an unhappy' experience for the market.
Since participation at Lloyd's is on a partly-paid basis (Names Action Group
chairman Peter Nutting candidly calls it a 'barely-paid' basis) a series of
large claims requiring prompt settlement will necessarily strain cash flow.
Less often identified, but also very important, is the burden of
administration as claims successively trigger reinsurance protections.
It is not only Lloyd's underwriters who are affected, Mr HazeIl points out:
the company market is faced with the same difficulty, and London-based
brokers are faced with the task of making collections not just on their
doorstep but from companies all over the world.
In the wake of the heavy losses suffered by reinsurers and in the
retrocession market (which provides insurance cover to the reinsurers
themselves) there has inevitably been a reduction in those willing to
underwrite catastrophe business, and the premium which those remaining in
the market demand has risen sharply.
According to the traditional insurance cycle, the resulting improvement in
the ratio of premium to exposure to risk should restore the attractiveness
of catastrophe-level cover, provided that the frequency of large losses
returns to historical norms.
Major reinsurance companies such as Swiss Re and Munich Re have both
expressed concern that this may prove not to be the case, and in such
circumstances it is hardly surprising that underwriters at Lloyd's and
elsewhere have taken the view that if a general upturn in insurance rates is
on its way, it is preferable to wait and take advantage of more predictable
and less inherently high-risk business.
The possibility of a long-term change in weather patterns as an effect of
global warming is only one of the issues involved. As a result of the
development of manufacturing processes and the organisation of both
industrial and service operations, losses from man-made causes such as big
fires or pollution incidents which approach those associated with natural
catastrophes such as hurricanes or earthquake can now be regarded as
inevitable.
The first industrial accident to generate an insured loss of Dollars 1bn was
the explosion on the Piper Alpha oil platform in the North Sea in 1988,
followed in 1989 by another at a Philips Petroleum plant in Pasadena. In
both cases, an important element in addition to the concentration of value
represented by expensive equipment was cover for loss of business as closure
of centralised production facilities disrupted related areas of production.
The chemical industry provides an almost insoluble problem for the insurer
in these terms, Mr HazeIl points out. Under normal conditions, the world
market will be in a state of marginal oversupply. A single major loss will
transform that to undersupply, which a second will multiply, creating a
level of exposure to which the insurance cover was not designed to respond.
The same development is observable in the service sector with the
development of very large retail units and centralised distribution
networks.
Not all insurers and reinsurers of catastrophe business have withdrawn from
the market.
Mr HazeIl continues to underwrite catastrophe business in the same basis as
he has since 1985, although since the spectacular market-wide losses of 1988
he has done so on a basis of greater premium income and lower exposure.
Mr HazeIl's syndicate also carries its catastrophe book without reinsurance.
Instead, the overall exposure to losses from natural catastrophe is limited,
and the effect of a loss on the overall results of the syndicate mitigated
by a broad spread of other business - a classical Lloyd's underwriter's
approach.
In Mr Hazell's view, there is no reason why such a first reinsurance account
should not form part of a prudent underwriter's book, nor part of a prudent
Name's portfolio of interests. The number of reinsureds will tend to be
small and stable, and each will typically be a relatively major player in
the particular catastrophe-prone area. As a result, the client will be more
responsive to the reinsurer's needs.
One example is the Japanese agricultural mutual Zenkyoren, which suffered
heavy losses from Typhoon 19 in September last year. 'There was no continual
worsening of the claim. We knew the exposure and paid out the Pounds 200m
within eight weeks,' Mr HazeIl comments, adding that the cover has been
renewed at a higher premium. 'I tell my clients we never pay claims, but we
occasionally lend them money,' he says with an ironic laugh.
Reinsurance brokers with a client who has a clean loss record will often
argue that it justifies a discount at times when rates in general are
rising. 'That's a fallacy,' Mr Hazell says. 'We need to return to the
realisation that once a premium is paid and cover offered, that premium has
been fully earned.' Furthermore, everybody will have to pay towards the
catastrophe cover that their insurer needs to buy.
Brokers are trying to find more underwriters who will replace lost
catastrophe capacity or provide an alternative.
There are franchise covers, for example, which respond to a dual trigger of
individual exposure and overall loss. These Mr HazeIl describes as 'a
perfectly fair and reasonable way of buying reinsurance'. So-called
financial or finite risk reinsurance is also widely touted, but that is
still a weapon which Lloyd's cannot have in its armoury.
Mr Hazell sees no difficulty in brokers rather than underwriters providing
the impetus for innovations in the field, which he considers is their job.
Lloyd's underwriters have 'no idea' what the public, or the insurance buyer
or reinsurance buyer wants, as face to face business is done with the
broker: 'That's how we work.'
Although Mr HazeIl remains uncertain about the wisdom of reinsuring
catastrophe exposures as a speciality or at a secondary level, others are
more sanguine.
Despite the well-publicised losses on the so-called LMX spiral, some
underwriters who provided such cover in the past continue to do so, although
the cost is higher and the cover offered more clearly segmented. Whole
account protection can still be obtained, but the terms divide the world
into Americas and non-Americas, and the insured perils into elemental and
man-made.
In order to trigger the policy, two categories must be affected. This
two-risk warranty avoids whole account cover responding to a single insured
event such as Piper Alpha, which, its proponents argue, was not what such
policies were intended to do.
What of the long-term future of Lloyd's as a catastrophe insurance market?
'It's not a question of the long-term. It's here and now,' Mr Hazell says.
'The sort of market we're in here, where people will back their judgment
with their own cash is ideally suited to catastrophe business.'
