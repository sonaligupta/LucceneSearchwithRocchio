FT  08 NOV 94 / Survey of International Fund Management (14): Foreign
exposure pared down - Japan / Emiko Terazono examines investment strategies
in the 1990s


   By EMIKO TERAZONO


Takahide Sakurai, head of the Japanese life insurers' association, is
frustrated by accusations that the industry is reluctant to invest abroad.
'The life insurance industry always seems to be blamed for the yen's
appreciation,' he says.
Japanese life insurers, the country's main institutional investors who have
suffered a sharp fall in unrealised profits on their stock holdings, remain
risk-averse in their investment strategies. Over the past few years, they
have been paring down their exposure to foreign investments, and have
allocated only a minimal amount to the domestic stock market.
The general understanding within the Tokyo financial community has been that
institutional investors have had a traditional role of recycling Japan's
current account surplus by buying foreign bonds and stocks. But the recent
rise in the yen has led to foreign exchange losses, and they have cut
investments in overseas financial markets, thus stopping the outflow of
capital from Japan.
During the 1980s, the life assurers increased investments in overseas
securities with high coupons, especially in US bonds. However, the industry
was hit by the subsequent rise in the yen which resulted in foreign exchange
losses of around Y4,600bn between 1985 and 1987, which was compensated by
the sales of life assurers' securities holdings.
Arguments over the life assurers' influence on the currency market aside,
statistics show that in spite of an overall increase in assets of Y3,400bn
during the first four months of the current business year, the insurers'
sold a net Y1,100bn in overseas securities. Only Y70bn were allocated to
domestic equities, Y4,400bn to Japanese bonds.
Mr Sakurai, also president of Dai-Ichi Mutual Life, admits that life
insurers remain bearish towards foreign investments. The amount of overseas
securities investments at Dai-Ichi has fallen to a third of the peak in the
late 1980s. For the industry as a whole, the outstanding balance of foreign
securities holdings declined 28 per cent from the peak in 1989 to Y14,047bn,
constituting 8.3 per cent of total assets, down from 15.3 per cent.
The risk-averse strategy at the insurers stems from the plunge in unrealised
profits on their stock holdings following the burst of the asset 'bubble'.
Although their unrealised gains on domestic equities recovered slightly in
the year to the end of March, 1994, thanks to a modest recovery in the Tokyo
stock market, the level is still substantially lower than the peak reached
in 1988. According to Credit Suisse in Tokyo, unrealised gains at the top 18
life assurers for the last business year totalled Y12,500bn, down 72 per
cent from 1988.
Without the gains on securities holdings, which have acted as a buffer
against losses on investments, the insurance companies remain reluctant to
take risks. 'In other words, the yen is unlikely to weaken unless the Tokyo
stock market rebounds,' says one fund manager.
However, some analysts believe that, under the right circumstances, Japanese
institutions could increase their investments in US bonds as was done in the
1980s.
Salomon Brothers in Tokyo points out that in October and November last year
Japanese residents were net buyers of Dollars 20bn in foreign bonds. This
coincided with a widening of the yield difference in 10-year bonds and a
weakening of the yen. Hence they reason that wide differentials between
domestic and US interest rates, signs of stability in the US Treasury market
and a stable currency market could induce Japanese purchases of US bonds.
On the other hand, Ms Mami Yoda, analyst at Credit Suisse, says asset
allocation at Japanese life insurance companies will remain conservative.
'Lower risk assets, such as loans and domestic bonds will be the investment
choice for 70 to 80 per cent of the Y13,000bn to Y14,000bn of new money
expected in fiscal year 1994,' she says.
The introduction of an accounting rule which allows life assurers to carry
domestic bonds at the purchase price on their books is also expected to
stimulate bond investment. The new method frees the companies from declaring
unrealised losses on bond holdings and allows the assurers to focus on the
yields to maturity as a measure of their investment.
And, while interest towards emerging markets has prompted some investment in
south-east Asia, the overall proportion remains small. Institutions which
have lowered the foreign securities portion in their portfolios to around 5
per cent are likely to try to maintain such levels. 'Even if the insurers
invest in foreign securities, it will probably be in yen-denominated
eurobonds,' says Ms Yoda.
With financial deregulation increasing the competitiveness of the industry,
Japanese insurers will need to improve their fund management strategies,
which during the 1980s were dominated by the pursuit of high-yielding
investments. Following the burst of the 'bubble' economy, risk averse
products have been the core of investment strategies in 1990s.
The life insurers have lagged in implementing the concept of asset-liability
management, and only started to match assets and liabilities a few years
ago. Ms Yoda says a more flexible asset-liability management needs to be
implemented through the use of derivatives and tailored investment products.
Meanwhile, the companies need to make more objective investment decisions
rather than those based on business relationships. Insurance companies have
often been the core of cross shareholdings, buying shares to cement business
relationships or to help promote sales of insurance policies. These holdings
need to be reviewed.
