FT  26 JUN 92 / Letter: How to spot the engineer


   From Mr RALPH SABRY-GRANT


Sir, Your readers can be forgiven for not realising that engineers are
recognised increasingly at work by their fluency with the appropriate
scientific literature and familiarity with computing.
Prof Edge's blue overalls and dirty fingernails (Letters, June 20) might
find a place in a black museum of the 19th century.
