FT  27 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Growth in advertising helps lift HTV by 75%
to Pounds 2.8m


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


With the help of Budgie the Little Helicopter, cost reductions and growth in
advertising revenue, HTV turned in a 75 per cent increase in pre-tax profits
for the six months to end June, up from Pounds 1.61m to Pounds 2.8m.
Trading performance at the ITV company for Wales and the west was even
stronger because the 1993 half year pre-tax figure included a Pounds 1.8m
property gain.
'This half year's figures represent a sustained and significant improvement
in the company's performance,' said Mr Louis Sherwood, HTV chairman.
Turnover on continuing operations was slightly down at Pounds 57.3m (Pounds
57.5m).
Profits from television activities rose sharply to Pounds 3.3m (Pounds 1m).
Earnings per share were ahead at 2.7p (2.3p) taken after property sales.
The company has restored an interim dividend of 0.75p against a single final
of 1p last year.
HTV has finally disposed of its last three non-media subsidiaries, including
the loss-making fine art business.
The company increased its advertising revenue by 11 per cent to Pounds 45.3m
(Pounds 40.7m), ahead of the ITV average of 7 per cent growth.
The outlook for the company was significantly improved by Flextech's
purchase in March of 20 per cent in the company for Pounds 27m. This reduced
borrowing to Pounds 1.53m (Pounds 27.9m).
The connection with Flextech, which owns or manages a range of cable and
satellite channels, has also led to new media deals for HTV.
Contracts are already in place for 1,250 hours of new programming for cable
and satellite. HTV is now producing nearly 3,000 hours a year,one of the
largest programmes producers in volume in the UK.
A significant contribution is promised from the cable and satellite channels
from next year.
