FT  05 MAR 94 / How To Spend It: All white on the night - Lucia van der Post
has been thinking pure thoughts as she samples some fine linen


   By LUCIA VAN DER POST


As Ralph Lauren once memorably put it: 'White in design has no competition.
White in design owns its own world. For expressing purity - whether in a
beautiful linen suit, a cotton T-shirt, or a towel - white is simple,
elegant, and fresh.' Yes, yes and yes again.
Clearly Christian Rucker, lately of Harpers & Queen's beauty department,
thinks likewise. Next week she launches a mail order business given over to
nothing but the delights of white.
The business, you will not be surprised to learn, is called The White
Company and it strikes me that she has hit on a small, exclusive and
desirable niche.
She offers a small range of household goods, mainly bed and table linen and
also some china, but the main criterion for selecting the products has been
quality and price.
There is about the company a sweet, old-fashioned air. There are pure white
cotton hand-embroidered sheets based on an antique design owned by a
collector of fine linens.
A set of double sheets is Pounds 107.50, king-sized is Pounds 115.50,
matching pillowcases are Pounds 21.50 for the standard Oxford and Pounds
28.50 for the continental size.
Plain linen sheets, which are usually hard to track down and cost a small
fortune when one does, are available at Pounds 205.50 for a double set, king
size is Pounds 305.50. Hemstitched, they are classically plain and
luxurious.
Thick white cotton bedspreads from Portugal cost Pounds 55.50 for the single
size, Pounds 75.50 for the standard double and Pounds 85.50 for the king
size.
Linen damask hand towels, a splendid wedding present, are Pounds 15.95 and
Pounds 19.95 while the crunchy white cotton towels are Pounds 15.50 for the
bath sheet, Pounds 9.50 for the standard bath size.
A set of four, hemstitched, pure Irish linen napkins is Pounds 42.95 and
there is a range of white bone china to go with them. Anyone who has tried
to buy linen recently will see at once what good value is offered.
The brochure will not be ready until March 15 but requests can be made now
by post to The White Company, 166 Bishops Road, London SW6 7JG or by
telephone on 071-384 1388.
Descamps household linens are always ravishingly pretty and Primrose
Bordier, its chief designer, originally sprang to decorative fame with
exquisitely pale and ethereal florals.
These days she, too, offers a purer, more streamlined aesthetic vision and
Ble (the name is French for wheat) is a subtle exercise in shades of cream
and white.
Prices are Pounds 98 for a double duvet cover, Pounds 55.90 for a double
flat sheet, Pounds 37.90 for a pillowcase, and from Pounds 18.90 for
embroidered hand-towels.
The full range can be seen at: The Boutique Descamps, 197 Sloane Street,
London SW1X 9QX (and by mail order); Liberty of Regent Street, London W1;
and Harrods of Knightsbridge, London SW1.
Those who sleep on the large feather pillows that are so prevalent in
continental Europe usually become fond of them and might like to know of a
reliable source.
Miller and Schultz imports high quality German pillows and bed linen. The
pillows are huge - 31 1/2 in by 31 1/2 in (80cm by 80cm) and are filled with
feather and down.
Large pure cotton pillow-cases to fit them have piped edges and button
fastenings. A goose-feather pillow and scalloped white cotton pillowcase
together cost Pounds 27.50. Duvet covers are also available at Pounds 19.95
while goose feather and down pillows (the same size) are Pounds 29.50.
All from Miller & Schultz, South Kenwood, near Kenton, Exeter, Devon EX6
8EX. Tel: 0626-891672.
Anyone interested in the full aesthetic possibilities of white might like
White By Design a book by Bo Niles. Available in paperback (Pounds 14.99,
published by Stewart, Tabori & Change), it is a visual and verbal
exploration of the many moods of white - from clean, streamlined and modern,
to soft, gentle and romantic.
There are rational, hard-edged buildings, exquisitely sophisticated
interiors, and soft, romantic rooms. Those longing to create tranquil,
graceful interiors to replace the frills and chintz will find it a great
source of visual inspiration.
