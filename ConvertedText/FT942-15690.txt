FT  14 APR 94 / For sale: fossilised industry, one owner - Its market and
profits are shrinking but British Coal will find a buyer


   By MICHAEL SMITH


It is one of Britain's most politically sensitive industries, it is
frequently lossmaking, and its markets are shrinking fast. So who would want
to buy British Coal?
The government, which started marketing the company yesterday, will not be
spoilt for choice when it comes to choosing who to sell to later this year.
Yet there are enough potential buyers around to suggest that, much to the
disappointment of privatisation's opponents, the government will be able to
sell.
The proceeds for the taxpayer will not be great compared with previous
privatisations; certainly less than Pounds 1bn and perhaps less than Pounds
500m. But making money is not the government's prime motive.
It wants rid of an industry that has caused it constant political problems -
the latest was the 1992 furore over pit closures - and which it believes
would be far better run in the private sector.
That view is shared by Mr Richard Budge and Mr Malcolm Edwards whose
companies, RJB Mining and Coal Investments, are mining, or intend to mine,
seven pits closed by British Coal in the last year.
If they are right in their belief that they can make the pits profitable,
the same improvements would presumably be possible at the 16 deep mines and
31 opencast sites put up for sale by the government yesterday.
The attractions of the package are further enhanced by their shares of
contracts with the generators of 30m tonnes a year to 1998.
Mr Edwards is wary of the liabilities attached to the pits being put up for
sale, which he says are more onerous than those at the four former British
Coal pits he will mine under leasing arrangements. It is uncertain that he
will bid for any of the packages.
RJB is one of the few companies thought to be considering putting in tenders
for all five packages. Hanson and RTZ, the two UK companies with the biggest
investment in coal, all of it abroad, express doubts privately about joining
the bidding. That may be a negotiating ploy, but analysts believe they are
serious.
Other than RJB, Hanson, and RTZ, few UK companies are capable of bidding for
and managing all the regions. It was partly for this reason that the
government ignored the pleading by British Coal that the industry be sold as
one company. Selling it in five chunks enables smaller companies to join in
the bidding.
Each of the five regions is thus likely to attract at least one bid.
The Scottish region is considered one of the most attractive. Mining
(Scotland), a consortium of several companies, and Scotcoal, a joint venture
between Miller Group, a construction and mining company, and Ryan Group, a
coal producer, have already declared they are likely to bid.
Ryan has also formed a joint venture, with Canadian aluminium company Alcan,
to consider a bid for the north-east region, where Caledonian Mining has
also expressed an interest.
Ryan is also said to be looking at south Wales, where it may face opposition
from a local buyout team. Mr Bob Siddall, director of British Coal's
opencast operation, may lead a bid for the central north and central south
regions.
For central north, comprising mainly pits in Yorkshire, he may be opposed by
Mr Alan Houghton, regional director. A consortium including the Union of
Democratic Mineworkers and and Jim Walter Resources, may also bid.
Jim Walter and Alcan are the only overseas companies so far to have
expressed interest. The government and NM Rothschild, the merchant bank
advising it, aim to remedy that within months by a marketing drive focusing
on the US.
They have their work cut out. Australian companies prefer to invest in Asia,
South African companies lack the cash to bid, and US companies such as
Ziegler, Consol and Cypress Amax appear unenthusiastic. The US is wary of
buying into an industry perceived abroad as problematic for its industrial
relations following the 1984-85 strike.
US companies have their own problems with rationalisation. They and their
investors are also acutely aware that all the UK mines' contracts with
electricity generators end in 1998. That bewilders a country where power
contracts are negotiated on a rolling basis with several contracts on
different timescales.
Rothschild's task will be to persuade the likes of Consol and Cypress Amax
that the generators will need large quantities of coal after 1998 and,
provided UK mine owners can trim costs, that they will want mainly British
coal.
If Rothschild fails to convince overseas companies, ministers can take
comfort that they will avoid a row about selling UK industry abroad. The
drawback would be that the sales price of the five regions will be lower.
British Coal will in any case be sold.

FROM NATIONALISATION TO PRIVATISATION
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
January 1947: Coal industry taken into state ownership under the
National Coal Board
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
1950: First Plan for Coal envisages output at 240m tonnes a year by 1965
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
1954: Annual production at its peak: more than 223m tonnes mined from
867 collieries
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
1963: NCB sets objective of breaking even after paying interest and
making 'proper provision' for depreciation
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
1972: Seven-week national strike over pay. Substantial damage to
industry requires huge capital injection from government. Coal Industry
Act 1973 writes off deficit and provides further grants
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
1973: Plan for Coal drawn up by National Coal Board and endorsed by
government in 1974 seeks to recapture markets from oil as world oil
prices rise sharply. Plan sees output increasing to 135m tonnes by 1985
and aims to reverse decline through investment at long-life and new
collieries
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
1974: Month-long national strike over pay. Further government cash
injections required, together with large price increase. Edward Heath
loses general election called during strike and three-day week
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
1979-80: Second oil price rise makes coal prices more competitive, but
recession hits demand and by middle eighties imported coal, natural gas
and oil more attractive
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
1984-5: Year-long pit strike follows election of Arthur Scargill as
president of National Union of Mineworkers in 1981
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
March 1987: NCB name formally changed to British Coal
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
1988: Energy secretary Cecil Parkinson announces government plans for
the 'ultimate privatisation' of the coal industry
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
1990: Electricity industry privatised, giving power companies more
freedom about choice of energy for generation. Coal suffers as a result
October 1992 Government announces closure of three-fifths of remaining
50 pits following growth in market share of nuclear power and emergence
of gas as leading generation fuel. Outcry fails to stop closures but
delays privatisation
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
March 1994: Production tops 12 tonnes per per man shift, compared with
two tonnes in 1984
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
April 13: Government puts five regional packages on market in spite of
British Coal's fears that splitting the company will weaken the industry
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
May 25: Deadline for preliminary applications
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Early June: Fuller sales details to be published
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Mid-September: Submission of bids
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
End December: Completion of sales
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
POTENTIAL BIDDERS
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Richard Budge, RJB Mining, chief executive
Crispian Hotson, Ryan Group, chief executive
Malcolm Edwards, Former commercial director, British Coal
Neil Greatrex, Union of Democratic Mineworkers, president
David Cawthra, Miller Group, chief executive
Colin MacLeod, Caledonian Mining, chairman
