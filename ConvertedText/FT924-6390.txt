FT  21 NOV 92 / Letter: Minimum lending rate that hits small businesses


   From Mr CLIVE S DAVIS


Sir, Following last week's 1 per cent reduction in base rates I have read
with interest the chancellor's exhortations to banks and building societies
to pass on to borrowers the full amount of the reduction.
Two weeks ago (with base rate at 8 per cent) I renewed my firm's modest
overdraft facility and obtained a 1 per cent reduction in the rate charged
'over base'. Knowing that base rates would be coming down further over the
next six to nine months, I pointed out to my bank manager that I did not
wish a minimum rate to be applied to the arrangement. The manager had
forgotten about minimum lending rates but confirmed that they still applied.
This week I received the written confirmation of the facility with a minimum
rate of 12 per cent equating to the 'x' over base just negotiated. At a
stroke the bank has increased its margin by 1 per cent. To add insult to
injury there is, of course, the arrangement fee of 1.5 per cent of the
facility.
It seems most small business - and also private - loans linked to base rate
have pre-set minimum rates. Result? Borrowing costs remain constant - bank
margins improve measurably.
I wonder whether small business owners generally - and, more importantly,
the chancellor - realise this. Clive S Davis,
