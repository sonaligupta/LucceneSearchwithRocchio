FT  16 MAR 94 / Russia to raise tariffs on range of imports


   By JOHN LLOYD

Pressure from Russia's powerful industrial and agricultural lobbies, coupled
with fears of rapidly falling government income, have persuaded the
government to bring in sweeping new import tariffs.
The tariffs, the subject of several decrees not yet published, are reported
by the Interfax news agency to raise the average tariffs from 6-7 per cent
to 15 per cent.
All imported food will be subject to a 15 per cent tax, while white sugar
will carry a 20 per cent tariff and cigarettes a 30 per cent import tax.
Tariffs on cars and perfume will also go up sharply: the changes will mean
that foreign cars will carry a tax of between 40-60 per cent.
The move appears to mark a success for Mr Alexander Zaveryukha, the deputy
premier with responsibility for agriculture, who had argued for a 25 per
cent rise in white sugar prices to protect domestic producers. At the same
time, however, tariffs on imported spare parts needed to re-tool industry
have fallen to 5 per cent.
The other main reason for the increase in tariffs is the rapidly decline in
government incomes, with the take from taxes running at little over half of
what was expected. The shift to tax foodstuffs which are bought largely by
the minority of wealthy Russians and the foreign community who buy at
largely foreign-owned shops can be put through with a minimum of political
pain.
At the same time, the choice of goods which are subject to the new tariffs
shows that the government has not abandoned itself to wholesale
protectionism, leaving large sectors unprotected and imposing on only a very
few commodities - weapons, caviar, matches and concentrated alcohol - a 100
per cent tariff increase.
