   By TONY WALKER

China's budget deficit is forecast to reach Yuan67bn(Pounds 5.2bn) this
year, an increase over last year's actual deficit using new accounting
procedures. Mr Liu Zhongli, China's finance minister, presented a bleak
picture of China's finances to the National People's Congress, warning that
difficulties in implementing a new tax system and widespread tax evasion
made it virtually impossible to predict revenues. China's 1994 state budget
anticipates revenues of Yuan476bn and expenditures of Yuan543bn. This year's
deficit will be funded largely by issuing Yuan115bn of domestic bonds. Mr
Liu indicated that this year's deficit would be about 15 per cent higher
than last year's.
