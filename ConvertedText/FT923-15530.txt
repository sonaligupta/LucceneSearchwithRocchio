FT  01 JUL 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries slip ahead of jobs data release

   NEW YORK, LONDON


WITH all eyes on tomorrow's important jobs data, US Treasury prices eased
slightly yesterday in the wake of news that had few implications about the
state of the economy.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year bond was down  1/8 at 102 15/32 ,
yielding 7.778 per cent. The two-year note was unchanged at 100 5/16 ,
yielding 4.817 per cent. Trading activity was reported to be light.
After opening slightly firmer, prices edged lower on the news that the May
Chicago Purchasers' index had risen slightly, that the Conference Board's
latest consumer confidence index had remained virtually unchanged, and that
the index of leading economic indicators rose 0.6 per cent in May. All three
sets of figures carried the same message: only very modest growth in the
level of business activity.
Trading was subdued primarily because participants were unwilling to get
involved ahead of tomorrow's June employment report. Hopes remain high that
the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates if, as expected, the jobs data
confirms continued weakness in labour conditions nationwide.
UK government bonds closed higher as the pound proved slightly more
resilient in the foreign exchange markets yesterday after Monday's weakness.
The gilt futures contract opened at 97.26 and traded up to 98.04 on an
average volume of about 22,000 contracts. In the cash market, the 11 3/4 per
cent gilt due 2003/07 rose from 116 1/32 to trade at 116 5/16 by late
afternoon while the latest auction stock - the 9 per cent gilt due 2012 -
traded up from 35 1/16 to 35 9/32 .
Dealers said sterling's performance in the foreign exchange markets was
likely to remain the main influence on the gilt market in the immediate
future. Sterling finished the day at DM2.8992/17, up from Monday's 2.8918/53
close, but still below the 2.90 level.
FRENCH government bonds ended  1/8 point lower in lacklustre market
conditions. Dealers said the slight drop in prices may reflect positioning
by traders ahead of tomorrow's auction of FFr9bn to FFr11bn of French
Treasury bonds.
The market is focusing on political concerns, which may well be reawakened
today, when the cabinet decides on the date of a referendum on the
Maastricht Treaty on European union. A September date is widely expected, so
any surprise could prompt some reaction in the French bond market.
THE German government bond market ended the day unchanged after prices were
eased up slightly during morning trading. Dealers said the bund market
lacked direction, and any movement was contained by strong resistance and
support levels, which were confining the market to a narrow range.
Short-term rates edged higher as nervousness about the direction of interest
rates continued to depress the market.
JAPANESE government bonds ended the day firmer, buoyed by hopes of an easing
in US and Japanese interest rates.
Dealers said the market opened on a weak note, but traded up steadily during
the day. The yield on the benchmark No 129 issue traded in a range of 5.265
to 5.3 per cent, ending at 5.275 per cent. In the futures market, the
September contract breached the 103 level for the first time in three
months, to reach a high of 103.06. The contract ended the day at 102.95, up
from Monday's close of 102.84.
