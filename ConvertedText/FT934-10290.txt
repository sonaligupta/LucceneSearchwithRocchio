FT  06 NOV 93 / Serbia clamps down on extremists

SERBIAN police have arrested 14 supporters of Mr Vojislav Seselj, in a move
to destroy popular backing for the one-time ultra-nationalist ally of Mr
Slobodan Milosevic, president of Serbia, in the run-up to elections next
month.
A police statement on Thursday night said those arrested were members of the
Serbian Chetniks, the paramilitary wing of Mr Seselj's Radical party, and
were charged with committing violent crimes against civilians.
The arrests represent the most direct admission by Belgrade that
paramilitaries from Serbia committed what amount to war crimes, including
murders and rape, on Bosnian and Serbian territory.
But instead of reflecting a crackdown on war criminals, the arrests appear
merely to signal the settling of scores by Mr Milosevic against Mr Seselj.
Indeed, Serbia's state-run media are promoting Mr Zeljko Raznatovic, known
as Arkan, another MP who commands a fierce paramilitary group.
