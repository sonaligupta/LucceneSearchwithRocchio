FT  28 MAR 92 / Firm faces winding-up petition by Bank


   By DAVID BARCHARD


THE BANK of England is to seek the winding-up of Jackson Financial Services,
an accountancy partnership in Sutton, south London, on the ground that it
has been acting as an unlicensed deposit-taker, David Barchard writes.
A petition for winding-up is to be heard in the High Court in June. Mr
Philip Wedgewood Wallace and Mr Roger Smith, both partners in KPMG Peat
Marwick, have been appointed joint provisional liquidators.
A tip-off led Bank investigators to the discovery that Jackson was taking
deposits from more than 100 customers. It is the 35th case in less than a
year in which the Bank has moved to close an alleged unlicensed depositor.
