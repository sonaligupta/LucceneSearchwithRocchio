FT  11 APR 94 / Economic Diary: Other economic news


Monday: UK consumer credit figures for February will be analysed for further
signs that UK consumers have been cutting back on their spending ahead of
this month's tax increases. The average forecast is for net credit of Pounds
250m, against Pounds 235m in January.
Tuesday: Monthly producer price figures for the US are expected to show
rises of 0.2 per cent in both the headline and the core rate, indicating
that there is still little sign of an inflationary upturn, despite the
strong economic growth.
Meanwhile, figures for French inflation in March are expected to show that
prices are under control, with a 0.3 per cent month-on-month increase
allowing the annual rate to drop to 1.6 per cent. For much of 1993, French
inflation was hovering around the 2 per cent mark.
Friday: The strength of the US economy should be shown by industrial
production figures for March, showing a monthly rise of 0.7 per cent and by
capacity utilisation figures, which are forecast to have edged up to 83.8
per cent, from 83.4 per cent in February. Very strong numbers will awaken
fears that the Fed will move to tighten rates again.
