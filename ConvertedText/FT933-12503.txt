FT  23 JUL 93 / UK Company News: British Syphon shares surge


British Syphon Industries, the industrial group, said yesterday that it was
to distribute a large part of its Pounds 33m cash reserves in a special
dividend amounting to 62.35p per share.
The shares responded via a 55p rise to 180p.
For the past two years the group's strategy had been to make a substantial
acquisition, a strategy that required the full support of Britannia, the
main shareholder.
However, in view of the difficulty in 'identifying' an appropriate
acquisition the board had decided to distribute a 'large' part of the cash
in the form of a special dividend.
