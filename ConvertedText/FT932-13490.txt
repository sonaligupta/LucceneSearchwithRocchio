FT  23 APR 93 / Conservative leader dies after surgery


   By AP


   CAPE TOWN


DR ANDRIES TREURNICHT, leader of the pro-apartheid Conservative party, the
official opposition in South Africa's white-dominated parliament, died
yesterday aged 72, AP reports from Cape Town.
Mr Frank le Roux, the party's chief whip, said Dr Treurnicht died in a Cape
Town hospital several days after undergoing heart by-pass surgery.
The death comes at a difficult time for the party, which has opposed
President F W de Klerk's reforms to dismantle apartheid and had one of its
most prominent leaders implicated in the assassination of Mr Chris Hani, the
ANC activist.
Dr Treurnicht had warned of chaos if the black majority was allowed to run
the country, but he distanced himself and his party from violence and from
militant right-wing groups such as the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance
Movement.
In the past week Mr Clive Derby-Lewis and his wife Gaye, prominent
Conservative party supporters, have been arrested for questioning about Mr
Hani's slaying. Neither has been charged.
Dr Treurnicht was dubbed 'Dr No' for his rigid resistance to political
reform. A fire-and-brimstone preacher of the Dutch Reformed Church, he
entered parliament in 1971 as a candidate of the ruling National party and
eventually became a cabinet minister whose portfolios included public works,
tourism and state administration.
As early as the 1970s, his conservative views clashed with movements toward
reform in the governing party. Dr Treurnicht was suspended as the party's
Transvaal provincial leader in 1982 and weeks later resigned from the
cabinet to form the Conservative party.
His party suffered an embarrassing defeat last March when whites voted
overwhelmingly in a referendum to support Mr de Klerk's reforms.
