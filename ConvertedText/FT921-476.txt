FT  28 MAR 92 / Turks confirm armour used on Kurds


   By Our Foreign Staff


GERMANY said yesterday that Turkey had acknowledged using German-supplied
armoured cars in clashes with its minority Kurds, Our Foreign Staff writes.
Mr Dieter Vogel, the government spokesman, said the Turkish government had
confirmed that vehicles from the former East German National People's Army
had been deployed in the Anatolia region 'for monitoring, surveillance and
observation'.
Bonn on Thursday accused Turkey of using German weapons against civilians
and halted arms sales to Ankara.
In Lisbon, the Portuguese presidency of the EC said it was seeking further
clarification from the Turkish authorities and EC diplomats in Ankara about
Turkey's attacks on Kurdish villages, before deciding on a common response
by the Twelve.
'There are indications that the situation is much more serious than has been
reported,' the Portuguese Foreign Ministry said yesterday.
EC diplomats refused to comment on what an EC declaration might contain, but
an EC-wide suspension of military equipment to a Nato member is thought
unlikely.
