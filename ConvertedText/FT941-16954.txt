FT  07 JAN 94 / Mexico army seals roads in war area

The Mexican army sealed off main roads in the areas of conflict in southern
Mexico yesterday, as President Carlos Salinas warned that more violence
would generate 'hate and political closure.'
A communique purporting to be from representatives in Mexico City of the
rebels in the southern state of Chiapas, and published in Mexican newspaper
La Jornada, indicated that the insurgents plan to continue what they call
their fight against poverty and hunger.
The Mexican army has regained virtual control of the area and all the towns
that had been captured, although it has said isolated fighting with the
rebel Zapatista guerrillas, as they called themselves, continues.
The government had called on the rebels to lay down their arms as a
condition for peace. The communique, if it represents the views of the rebel
leaders, raises the prospect of a prolonged campaign.
Many of the rebels have fled back to the jungle.
Some 61 rebels have been killed.
The head of the government human rights commission promised yesterday to
investigate accusations that soldiers had executed rebels captured in the
town of Ococingo.
Mr Jorge Madrazo, president of the National Commission of Human Rights, told
reporters that he would investigate any alleged offences, including any by
the army.
His organisation has sent forensic experts to examine bodies of seven rebels
who appeared to have been shot in the back of the head at close range.
String was attached to their hands, and they had lesions on their wrists,
suggesting they had been tied up before being killed.
All were dressed in outfits of the peasant guerrillas.
President Salinas said yesterday the army and security forces have complied
with their responsibility according to the law. He said there was a clear
commitment to respect human rights.
