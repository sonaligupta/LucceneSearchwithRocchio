FT  11 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Confused ideas about objectives of
human resource management (2)


   From Mr MARK MCKERGOW


Sir, I fear Sue Fernie and David Metcalf may have been asking the wrong
question. By asking managers responsible for personnel matters to rate
management-employee relations on a seven-point scale, they have collected
data on those managers' own perception of the states of their organisations.
Fernie and Metcalf go on to confuse these perceptions with the 'actual'
state of these organisations. Is it surprising, then, that managers who use
HRM methods are more aware of the problems they have with their people, see
the benefits of improving things and rate their current position accordingly
modestly, whereas those who do not are satisfied with things as they are and
report good results?
Would Captain Bligh have reported good relations with the crew of The
Bounty? I suspect so.
