ENERGIE-Versorgung Niederoesterreich (EVN), the Austrian energy utility,
yesterday reported higher turnover and profits for 1992-93, and promised an
increased 'winter warmer' dividend.
Turnover was Sch10.3bn (Dollars 873m), up 4.6 per cent on the previous year
in spite of the economic downturn. Operating results were up 12.4 per cent
to Sch761m. The dividend is set at 21 per cent, up from 19 per cent in
1991-92. Earnings per share rose 12.3 per cent to Sch82.
'Higher volumes of business in all areas, combined with increased
productivity and adherence to a strict cost management policy, have provided
the result,' said Mr Rudolf Gruber, chairman.
EVN has agreed to sell up to half of its 50 per cent stake in RAG, the
Austrian oil and gas exploration company in which Mobil and Shell each hold
25 per cent. The buyer is Bayernwerk, the German utility with which it will
form a new holding company. The price was not disclosed. EVN paid Dollars
98m for its stake in 1992.
Mr Gruber said the outlook was positive. EVN would benefit by about Sch100m
following Austrian tax reform.
