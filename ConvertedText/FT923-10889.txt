FT  28 JUL 92 / Checkpoint Charlie in business

   BERLIN, BONN


A BERLIN court yesterday approved an DM800m (Pounds 276m) business centre
project on the site of Checkpoint Charlie, the former crossing into East
Germany.
It dismissed a case by an east Berlin woman who claimed to own the site,
ruling that property at the Berlin Wall could not be returned under the
terms of the 1990 German unification treaty. Checkpoint Charlie was
dismantled in June 1990 after the city was united.
Central European Development Corporation, majority-owned by US cosmetics
company Estee Lauder and headed by Mr Mark Palmer, former US ambassador to
Hungary, was given the green light by the city government last year to erect
the American Business Centre on the site. ,
Nearly 3,000 dentists in Germany's populous North Rhine region downed drills
and closed surgeries yesterday in protest at the government's plans to cut
spending on the state-subsidised health care system, writes Quentin Peel in
Bonn. Members of the Free Association of German Dentists are being urged to
only accept patients privately.
