FT  16 MAR 94 / International Company News: Banks warn of Haka exposure

Three leading Finnish banks, struggling to recover from the country's
financial crisis, warned yesterday that they faced further big credit losses
after the Haka construction group filed for bankruptcy.
Unitas, the country's second largest banking group, said the collapse could
produce write-offs of up to FM450m (Dollars 81.89m), but it stressed that
this did not alter its forecast of a substantially reduced deficit in 1994.
It said its total exposure to Haka amounted to around FM1.2bn.
Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, Finland's largest bank, said it would suffer a loss
of no more than FM200m from the bankruptcy. It added that the amount would
be covered by a FM900m provision, taken last year, for unidentified bad
loans. Its claims on Haka companies total FM815m.
A third bank, Postipankki, estimated potential credit losses at FM300m,
although its total exposure amounts to just over FM800m. It said the nominal
value of its collateral was more than FM750m.
'The final credit and guarantee losses are dependent upon both the
successful liquidation of the collateral as well as the orderly completion
of on-going projects,' Postipankki stated.
Rautaruukki, the Finnish state-controlled steel group, yesterday unveiled a
FM144m profit after financial items for 1993, a sharp turnround on the
FM697m loss reported for the previous year.
It benefited from firmer steel prices, cost-cutting and the weaker Finnish
markka. But the result was held back by high financing costs, lower demand
in western Europe, and continued losses at the company's Transtech rolling
stock unit. The group said it would not pay a dividend for the third
consecutive year.
Operating profits after depreciation were FM829m, or 11.8 per cent of sales
of FM7.01bn. This compares with profits of FM454m on turnover of FM6.50bn a
year earlier.
