   By Our Foreign Staff


Japan will give Russia and other former Soviet states Y6.5bn through the
International Red Cross, foreign minister Michio Watanabe said yesterday,
writes Our Foreign Staff.
Most of the humanitarian aid would go to Russia to improve supplies of food
and medicine. The grants will be disbursed by the end of March and are timed
to coincide with a conference to co-ordinate help for the Commonwealth of
Independent States in Washington next week.
In Lisbon, Mr Roland Dumas, the French foreign minister, called for a
conference in Europe to follow up the Washington meeting. Portugal, holder
of the EC presidency, said the conference could take place in March or
April.
