FT  01 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: Kuala Lumpur SE alters
corporate reporting rules


   By REUTER


   KUALA LUMPUR


The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange has amended its corporate reporting rules so
that all companies listed on the exchange's main board have to announce
their annual results three months from their financial year-end instead of
six months currently, Reuter reports from Kuala Lumpur.
The exchange said in a statement that this was to allow investors to make
better investment decisions and enhance transparency. Companies which do not
provide their results within the specified time may be suspended until the
results are ready for release, the exchange said.
The KLSE also said it would make it easier for companies to transfer from
the exchange's second board to the main board by relaxing one requirement.
It said it would remove the need for companies to issue detailed
introductory circulars, which are a document second-board companies have to
release to inform the public of their transition to the main board.
The changes take effect from the year ending December 31 1995.
