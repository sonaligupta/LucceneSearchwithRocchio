FT  27 SEP 94 / International Company News: Media groups to merge networks


   By REUTER


   MELBOURNE


Austereo, the Australian radio group, and the entertainment group Village
Roadshow, which were involved in a hostile takeover bid last week, have
agreed to merge their radio networks, Reuter reports from Melbourne.
In place of its hostile bid, Village will acquire at least 50.1 per cent of
Austereo in two stages via a placement and a partial bid at ADollars 0.55
(USDollars 0.40) a share higher than Village's first offer.
Austereo will issue 52.5m shares to Village and Village will offer ADollars
1.75 a share for 20 per cent of each Austereo's shareholder's existing
stake.
Village Roadshow's original takeover offer for Austereo was ADollars 1.20 a
share, but the market soon moved above this level and on Friday the shares
closed at ADollars 1.35.
Austereo shares were suspended yesterday at the company's request.
The Austereo share issue, together with Village Roadshow's current 12.8 per
cent stake, will take Village's shareholding to 40.8 per cent of Austereo's
enlarged capital.
Under the deal, Austereo will purchase Village's Triple M radio stations in
Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide, and may acquire Triple M in Perth
by means of the share issue.
The Triple M stations will join the current Austereo network comprising
seven stations in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Canberra.
The merger is subject to clearance by the anti-monopoly Trade Practices
Commission and approval by Austereo shareholders.
