FT  06 AUG 93 / Debit card payments gain popularity


   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor


THE USE of debit cards to make payments grew strongly last year as they were
substituted for cheques, it was disclosed yesterday. Debit card transactions
rose by 45 per cent to 522m, compared with 360m the previous year.
The Association for Payment Clearing Services said that further transfer
from the use of cheques as well as the substitution of debit cards for cash
and credit card payments could lead to 2.5bn debit payments a year by the
year 2000.
Cheques and paper credits fell for the second year running from its 1990
peak, down 4 per cent to 4.1bn transactions. Transactions are expected to
fall a further 3 per cent a year this decade.
The figures indicate the growth in card payments, which are favoured by
banks because they reduce expensive cash and paper clearing. The total cost
of the clearing system has been estimated by the association at Pounds 4.5bn
a year.
However, cash remains dominant with 66 per cent of payments of more than
Pounds 1 in value being made by notes and coins.
Total transactions with plastic cards, including cash withdrawals from
automated teller machines, rose nearly 12 per cent to about 2.5bn. Credit
card payments resumed their growth after a static year in 1991, and rose 3
per cent. The number of cash withdrawals from ATM cash machines rose 7 per
cent, a significant slowing on 30 per cent annual growth rates during the
1980s.
