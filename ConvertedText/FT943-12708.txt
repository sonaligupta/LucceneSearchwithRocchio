FT  23 JUL 94 / Airport costs up


Profits at Manchester Airport, owned by the 10 borough councils in greater
Manchester, fell to Pounds 16.6m in the year to the end of March compared
with Pounds 38m in 1992-93. The fall was a result of higher operating costs
and interest charges after opening its second terminal last year.
