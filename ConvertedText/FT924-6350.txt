FT  21 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee retreats from 9-month
highs - Week in the markets


   By RICHARD MOONEY


LONDON COFFEE futures retreated from nine-month highs reached early in the
week as traders played down the prospects of significant progress being made
at next week's London talks on renegotiating the International Coffee
Agreement.
African coffee producers are ready to compromise with consumer countries on
export controls in a new world pact, the Reuter news agency reported
yesterday from Abidjan, capital of the Ivory Coast. After a four-day
meeting, delegates to the 25-member Inter-African Coffee Organisation said
it would recommend that producers take the main responsibility for stopping
illegal exports at the London talks. Producers had been pushing for the
burden of policing export controls to be shared.
But London traders expected decisions on a new price-support pact to be
delayed until the new US and Brazilian administrations had settled down.
The January robusta contract at the London Futures and Options Exchange,
which on Tuesday had peaked at Dollars 990 a tonne, fell back to Dollars 942
before closing yesterday at Dollars 968 a tonne, up Dollars 9 on the week.
Traders said this reflected pressure from hedging sales and profit-taking
following the recent highs and was further influenced by signs of producer
seling, notably from Uganda and Indonesia.
A forecast that the 1992-93 coffee crop in Colombia, the world's
second-biggest producer, would fall by between 2m and 2.5m bags (60 kg each)
from 1991-92's 17.5m bags failed to buoy sentiment. 'It would seem as if
comments from Colombia (the forecast was made by the head of the country's
exporters' association) are counter productive,' said GNI, the London trade
house, in its daily Commodity Report yesterday. 'If they are bullish the
market thinks it is trying to talk the market up - if so, then what does it
have to hide?'
Base metals prices were mostly firmer at the London Metal Exchange as
markets continued to consolidate following recent falls. The rally was led
by copper, which closed Pounds 19.50 up on the week in the cash position, at
Pounds 1,404.50 a tonne, though the market was again aided by sterling's
weakness.
Zinc also moved higher in a thin market, the cash position gaining Dollars
27.50 to Dollars 1,046.50 a tonne, and aluminium prices built on last week's
rally, helped by concern about a possible strike at Pechiney, the French
producer.
Lead prices bounced after reaching the lowest levels for five months in
sterling terms and for six years in dollar terms. As the market responded to
bullish chart patterns, good recent trade interest and sterling weakness,
the cash price rose to Pounds 306.50 a tonne and closed yesterday at Pounds
305.50 a tonne, up Pounds 12.50 on the week.
One metal that did not join in with the upturn was nickel, which closed
yesterday at Dollars 5,405 a tonne, down Dollars 22.50 on the week. The
market was not in the mood to respond positively to news early in the week
that Cuban nickel output was expected to to fall 15,000 tonnes short of the
50,000-tonne target for this year. It remained more concerned about the
continuing flood of metal from the former Soviet Union. The Commonwealth of
Independent States, as it is now called, is expected to export 120,000
tonnes of nickel in 1992, up from 100,000 in 1991, the Interfax news agency
said this week, quoting officials from Norilsk Nickel, the main CIS
producer.
The precious metals market livened up yesterday after a generally downbeat
week. Dealers said gold was supported by expectations of a realignment of
the weaker currencies within the European Community's Exchange Rate
Mechanism and rumours of a Bundesbank rate cut next week. The price rose to
Dollars 336.35 a troy ounce, up Dollars 2.20 on the day but down 10 cents on
the week.
The earlier fall to Dollars 334.15 an ounce had been influenced by
Australian selling induced by the weakness of the national currency. 'If
Australian producers are willing to sell at Dollars 335, then how much
upside does the market have?' asked the GNI report . . . 'Very little we
believe.'
Platinum moved up with gold to Dollars 356.25 an ounce at yesterday's
afternoon fixing, up Dollars 2.60 on the week. Dealers said the white metal
was also boosted by Japanese buying as hopes of a government boost to the
economy lifted the Nikkei stock index.
Silver was also influenced by gold's upturn and the London market's cash
position regained 2.5 cents yesterday to close 1 cent down on the week at
378.5 cents an ounce.
