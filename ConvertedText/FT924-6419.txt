FT  21 NOV 92 / De Klerk rejects plea by inquiry judge


   By PATTI WALDMEIR


   JOHANNESBURG


PRESIDENT F W de Klerk yesterday rejected a request from Judge Richard
Goldstone, head of a judicial commission into political violence, for added
powers to investigate the South African security forces.
Judge Goldstone, who met the president yesterday in Pretoria, said this week
he could not properly investigate the security forces - focus of a political
scandal after revelations of a military intelligence plot to discredit the
African National Congress - without added powers and resources.
Mr De Klerk said last night he saw no need to increase Mr Goldstone's
powers. He said additional policemen would be assigned to assist the
inquiry, but implied that these were not to be used for probing covert
intelligence activities.
Pretoria has come under severe criticism from opposition parties in South
Africa, as well as from abroad, over its decision on Wednesday to launch an
internal military inquiry into such activities. The head of the military
investigation, General Pierre Steyn, is to conduct his investigation in
parallel with Judge Goldstone.
The fact that the investigation is to conducted by a serving officer, and
not by an independent judicial commission, has cast doubt over its
impartiality.
