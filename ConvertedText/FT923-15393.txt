FT  02 JUL 92 / Names trapped in a spiral of disaster: A group of more than
4,000 Lloyd's Names heard yesterday that they would soon have to pay a
further Pounds 307m to meet losses from disasters they helped to insure
against in the late 1980s. Richard Lapper describes the LMX spiral, which
produced the losses, and tells the story of Gooda Walker


   By RICHARD LAPPER


IN THE 1980s, companies and syndicates in the London insurance market
developed a highly profitable business based on the sale of reinsurance
policies to each other.
The business was built on two simple concepts: large catastrophes such as
hurricanes are expensive when they occur, but they happen infrequently.
The insurance professionals who developed what became known as 'the spiral'
also recognised that because the resources that would be needed in the event
of a catastrophe were huge - the Piper Alpha oil rig disaster in July 1988
cost Dollars 1.4bn (Pounds 737m) - a way had to be found to spread the risk
as widely as possible. But the method conceived as a means of spreading risk
rebounded badly.
Instead of diversifying the losses, the spiral served to concentrate the
damage in a relatively small corner of the London insurance market. Names -
the individuals whose wealth backs the market - face huge losses as a
result.
At Lloyd's, the biggest of those syndicates have been devastated by some of
the biggest losses recorded at the insurance market - nearly half the Pounds
2.06bn loss reported by the market in 1989.
The spiral was a high-risk, high-reward business. It was also potentially
lethal. Names needed to be 'richer than God' to take part in the spiral,
said Mr Jim Payne, a leading reinsurance broker. But thousands of Names
whose total wealth amounted to little more than a suburban house were sucked
in.
There was a massive inflow of Names to the market after 1985, drawn into
Lloyd's by the prospect of easy money.
The overcapacity increased competition and depressed premium rates. Some
underwriters became complacent. 'They wrote business as if the big one was
never going to happen,' one agent said.
The spiral worked like this: an insurance company insured a large number of
houses in the UK and wished to protect itself against the risk of storms,
such as the ones in October 1987 that laid waste swathes of the south-east
of England.
The insurance company insured all losses up to Pounds 100m. Brokers
operating on its behalf devised a reinsurance programme that might reinsure
losses exceeding Pounds 100m.
That would be be only one of many similar exposures re-insured on the London
market. A way had to be found to spread the risk in the event of a number of
disasters happening during the same period.
Companies and syndicates would divide risks into layers. One typical
programme might insure all losses from Pounds 100m up to, say, Pounds 150m.
That slice of risk would, in turn, be divided into layers of say Pounds 2m
each. Each of those layers would in turn be divided up and offered for
reinsurance to syndicates and companies.
But the spiral did not stop there - in fact, it had only really begun.
Reinsurers would now seek to offset some of the risk they had assumed.
This is called a retrocession market - the reinsurance of reinsurance.
The reinsurer who might already have participated in, say, a dozen
reinsurance transactions, would seek to buy cover in order to offset his own
overall exposure to catastrophe loss. Those retrocession programmes would
again be layered and so on. The retrocession markets became known as London
Market Excess or (LMX).
The effect was to create a chain or spiral of reinsurance arrangements in
the market, with many syndicates and companies cropping up at different
points in the chain - sometimes as reinsurers assuming risk, sometimes as
reinsurers ceding risk to another reinsurer.
That high-risk and fragmented market helped to improve cashflow because of
the time taken to collect hundreds of small reinsurance claims.
Reinsurers at the top of the spiral were paying claims from a loss at the
Avondale shipyard in the US nearly 12 years after an incident which gave
rise to losses of more than Dollars 100m, even though the owner of the
shipyard and the vessels were paid soon after the event.
Confidence among spiral reinsurers was fuelled by the infrequency of large
claims between 1970 and 1987. Catastrophe reinsurers produced good profits,
and many new Names were attracted to these syndicates.
Warnings from professionals that this was a high-risk market were ignored.
Names were encouraged in some cases by a number of agents anxious to
increase their own income - itself based on fees and profit commissions
charged to Names.
Setting premium rates had been at best 'haphazard', said Mr Martin
Rodney-Smith, whose company has recently completed an investigation on
behalf of affected Names. But in this soft market, arbitrage - the
exploitation of price imperfections - became rife. Underwriters could
reinsure a set of liabilities for one price then reinsure the same
liabilities for less, pocketing the difference. 'Making a turn was the
easiest way to make money,' said one successful spiral underwriter.
Spiral business was extremely attractive business for brokers, who earned 10
per cent commission on any deal. But the market was blown apart by several
catastrophes in the late 1980s.
As the market became more efficient in processing claims, the spiral speeded
up and underwriters were called upon to pay claims faster.
Underwriters who did not have to pay out for five years after hurricane
Alicia in 1983 were faced with huge claims for hurricane Hugo in September
1989 barely a year after the event.
The disasters exposed a big structural weakness at Lloyd's. Syndicates -
annual joint ventures of Names - exist only for a year, so they cannot build
up reserves to cover losses from future years.
Lloyd's syndicates are obliged to distribute profits earned in the good
years, leaving Names with the responsibility of building up their own
reserves. Few appear to have done so.

HOW THE SPIRAL WORKS AT LLOYD'S
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
1 A large direct insurer issues 2m homeowner policies, averaging Pounds
50,000 - total exposure Pounds 100bn. It receives a total premium of
Pounds 250m.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
2. The insurer buys excess loss reinsurance covering a total exposure of
Pounds 225m. This is spread among five reinsurers, each of which
receives Pounds 5.4m in premium. A broker places the business with each
reinsurer and earns a commission of 10 per cent.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Those reinsurers buy excess loss reinsurance - or retroinsurance -
covering a total exposure of Pounds 175m. They pay premiums of Pounds
486,000 to 25 separate reinsurers. Again a broker makes 10 per cent on
each deal.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
4. These reinsurers buy their own excess loss reinsurance - or
reinsurance of retrocession - to cover Pounds 137.5m in exposure.  This
is spread among a further 125 reinsurers, each of which receives Pounds
43,740 in premium and takes on exposure of Pounds 1.1m. Yet again a
broker makes 10% on each deal.

The size of loss increases but the frequency of loss decreases as you
go though the spiral; the same reinsurers and brokers can participate
at different levels of the market.
