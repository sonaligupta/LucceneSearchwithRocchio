FT  26 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Halifax in search for new chief executive


   By DAVID BARCHARD


HALIFAX, the largest UK building society with assets of Pounds 58bn, has
approached a firm of headhunters to help it select its next chief executive.
Mr Jim Birrell, the present chief executive, retires in August next year on
his sixtieth birthday. Though an internal candidate has not been ruled out
to succeed him, it is understood that Mr Jon Foulds, the Halifax chairman,
believes that an outsider is needed to overhaul the society to face the
challenges of the banking markets in the late 1990s.
The two strongest internal candidates are Mr David Gilchrist, the group
general manager, and Mr Mike Whitehouse, the operations director who is in
charge of the day to day running of the building society's core business.
Mr Foulds is believed to be planning a much more radical shake-up of the
society and the upper echelons of its management.
He is thought to favour a banker or an industrialist as the next head of the
society.
His moves have revived speculation that Halifax may be reviewing a board
decision in June 1988 to remain mutually owned and not to follow Abbey
National with a stock market flotation.
At the time, most of Halifax's senior management were believed to favour the
flotation, but were overruled when a majority of the directors voted against
it.
