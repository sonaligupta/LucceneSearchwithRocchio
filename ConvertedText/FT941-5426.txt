FT  07 MAR 94 / First union airtime bought on BBC


The MSF manufacturing union is to become the first union to buy BBC airtime
to get its message across to members and potential members.
The union, the UK's fifth largest, has bought a 30-minute slot on BBC
Select, the BBC's specialist night-time service. The programme, which will
be listed in the Radio Times, will go out at 5.30am on May 12 - the day
after the union's annual conference.
Until now The Business Channel, operated by BMH Communications, which has an
agreement with BBC Select, has been the domain of employers.
