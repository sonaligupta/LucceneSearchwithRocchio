FT  23 APR 93 / International Company News: PWA ready to go to court over
reservations system

CANADA'S Competition Tribunal said it had no jurisdiction to allow PWA,
parent company of Canadian Airlines, to break its contract to use the Gemini
computerised reservations system and switch to American Airlines' Sabre
system.
The tribunal says it expected the issue to go the Federal Court of Canada,
and PWA immediately confirmed it would take this step.
PWA and Air Canada were founder-owners of Gemini in July 1989. Both carriers
merged their own systems into Gemini to gain efficiency.
PWA applied to the Competition Tribunal to have the contract declared void
on anti-competition grounds, but the tribunal said allowing Canadian to
transfer to Sabre would not lessen competition.
Reuter adds: Mr Rhys Eyton, PWA chairman, said the carrier would continue to
work with AMR to complete the proposed alliance.
AMR has said it would invest CDollars 246m in Canadian for a 25 per cent
voting stake, provided Canadian switched from Gemini to Sabre.
