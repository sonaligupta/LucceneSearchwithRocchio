FT  25 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Lloyds Abbey Life sells Irish insurance arm


   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent


Lloyds Abbey Life has sold Abbey Life (Ireland), its Irish insurance
subsidiary, to Canada Life Assurance Company of Great Britain, for its book
value of Pounds 20.6m.
Mr Chris Wiscarson, finance director of Lloyds Abbey Life, said the sale
reflected the company's view that without a bank distribution network in
Ireland, the subsidiary's growth potential was limited.
The new owners will merge their Irish operations with those of the Abbey
Life subsidiary to form the third largest Irish insurer. It will have total
assets of Pounds 557m, 135,000 policyholders and a market share of 5.3 per
cent. Before the merger, Abbey Life ranked 11th in Ireland with Canada Life
13th.
