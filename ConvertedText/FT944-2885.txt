FT  15 DEC 94 / International Company News: ABN Amro to issue Kc1bn bond


   By AP-DJ


   AMSTERDAM


ABN Amro, the Netherlands' largest banking group, said it was issuing a
Kc1bn (Dollars 22.2m) bond, due December 15 1997, AP-DJ reports from
Amsterdam. The issue price of the bond, which carries an 11 per cent coupon,
has been set at 99.70, giving an effective yield of 11.123 per cent.
The Amsterdam-based group said it was issuing the bond on its own account
but that it would also likely place some of the proceeds of the bond with
corporate borrowers who are looking for Czech koruna.
The bank also said that early redemption of the bond was not possible and
that the issue was restricted to outside the US and the UK. In the
Netherlands, the bonds are not offered to private investors.
Payment of the bond is due on December 15, 1994. The bond might be listed on
a stock exchange in the future but ABN Amro said this had not yet been
decided.
