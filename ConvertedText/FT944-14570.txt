FT  22 OCT 94 / Keys takes up business role


   By MARK SUZMAN


   JOHANNESBURG


Gencor, the South African mining house, yesterday announced that Mr Derek
Keys, former South African finance minister and a former chairman of Gencor,
had accepted the chairmanship of Billiton, the international resources
company purchased by Gencor from Shell in July for Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds
800m). Mr Keys was regarded as one of Gencor's most successful chief
executives and the announcement, at Gencor's annual general meeting in
Johannesburg, won approval from shareholders. It will help allay analysts'
concerns about the difficulties of consolidating Billiton's diverse
operations into a single company. It also ends speculation on Mr Keys'
future, after he stepped down as finance minister last month following two
years in office. Mr Keys, who will be based in London, said he was very
optimistic about Billiton's prospects.
