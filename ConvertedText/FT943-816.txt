FT  27 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Reckitt rights not welcome


   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN


The timing, if not the substance, of the move by Reckitt & Colman, the
household goods and pharmaceutical products group, to acquire L & F
Household from Eastman Kodak, took the market by surprise and triggered a
steep decline in Reckitt shares.
Reckitt stock was the FT-SE 100's worst performer, closing 43 off at the
session's low of 555p, as the market reacted violently to the deeply
discounted Pounds 230m cash call which accompanied the L & F Household
purchase.
Talk that Reckitt was about to buy L & F Household has been in the market
for around two months. In August, and before the latest steep slide in share
prices, the market was full of stories that Reckitt was prepared to pay
upwards of Dollars 1.7bn for L & F.
One leading analyst described the proposed purchase of L & F as a 'good
strategic move' but said the market had not taken kindly to the rights
issue. He professed concern, however, at Reckitt's claim that the purchase
will have insignificant impact on its earning's for 1995. 'Insignificant
impact is taken as market code for earnings dilution,' he said.
