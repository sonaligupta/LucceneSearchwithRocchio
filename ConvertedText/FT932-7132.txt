FT  25 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Argyll strong


   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON and PETER JOHN


A surge in Argyll Group ahead of full-year results today saw the shares
close 15 1/2 ahead at 317p in good volume of 4.4m. Results are expected to
reach the top end of analysts forecasts, of Pounds 405m to Pounds 420m, with
positive news also anticipated on current trading. Argyll recently launched
a price cutting programme.
The shares have generally lagged behind the rest of the food retail sector,
which has itself been under a cloud as some brokers have grown fearful of
the impact of food discounters. In addition, recent figures from J.
Sainsbury underlined for some critics the maturity of the market and pointed
to only slow growth at best in the near-term. Sainsbury shares were also
strong yesterday, gaining 2 to 468p after going ex-dividend.
Some stability returned to Burmah Castrol as the market made a belated
response to news late last Friday that two of the company's directors had
bought additional shares in the company.
Burmah shares fell over four per cent last week as the market focused on a
severe profits warning by Brent Chemicals. Yesterday, Burmah Castrol stock
edged up 3 to 691p, albeit in relatively thin turnover.
Mr Brian Hardy, Burmah's finance director, bought 1,000 shares at 689p and
Mr JM Fry, managaging director, bought 5,000 shares at 688p.
Leading oil shares were disappointing, according to dealers, as the market
continued to worry about the forthcoming Opec meeting, scheduled for June 8.
But NatWest Securities said two of the three key factors which drive the
sector 'looked quite promising'.
NatWest saw a good chance of oil prices firming after the Opec meeting,
'perhaps towards Dollars 20 a barrel, amid fears of plans for higher energy
taxes in the US and Europe and a seasonal pick up in oil demand'. The broker
also pointed to higher world refining margins, currently at Dollars 3.58 a
barrel, compared with the Dollars 2.79 achieved in the first quarter.
NatWest maintained its positive stance on BP, describing the shares as
'still the best recovery story', but said the market was still
over-optimistic about Shell. BP eased to 307p while Shell edged up 3 to
607p.
Second-line oils attracted interest, especially Clyde which rose 2 1/2 to
50p after 750,000 shares changed hands.
British Steel was one of the market's most active stocks with some 7.7m
shares were traded during the session.
The shares burst through the 100p barrier for the first time since November
1991 and closed a net 3 1/4 higher at 102 3/4 p, with dealers citing last
week's news of the closure of several steel plants in Germany as the main
reason for the upturn in the stock. Steel was also the most heavily traded
stock option where the equivalent of more than 7m shares changed hands.
The company, scheduled to report preliminary results towards the end of next
month, is in its 'closed season', and therefore unable to disclose
information to the market.
British Steel shares have staged a remarkable recovery since reaching their
all-time low of 46 1/2 p last November. The stock has been bolstered by a
series of European steel price increases, with more expected in the autumn.
Reuters Holdings gained 17 to 1310p as further strength in the New York
market helped internationally traded stocks.
BAT Industries, which also has a big exposure in the US, rose 8 to 845p. The
tobacco and insurance group is to issue over 1.5bn new shares as a result of
its planned capitalisation issue and its enhanced scrip alternative
proposal.
A profits downgrading depressed Lloyds Bank which closed 5 off at 536p on
relatively good turnover of 3.2m. NatWest, reflecting the successful cash
raising in the US, via the issue of Dollars 250m preference shares, edged up
2 to 475p.
The latest burst of strength in the Hong Kong market triggered renewed
buying of HSBC, which moved up 10 to 615p.
TSB improved 2 more to 185p with dealers still talking about the likely sale
of the bank's Hill Samuel arm.
British Airways rose 10 1/2 to 307 1/2 p ex-rights after recent weakness.
Doubts hanging over the stock were cleared last week when BA announced a
rights issue after months of speculation.
Property group UK Land was forced for the second time this year to issue a
statement saying it knew of no reason why its shares had risen. They closed
9 up at 37p. In February, UK Land responded to a 4p rise to 30p by reminding
the market that there was a deficit of shareholders' funds on March 311992
of Pounds 31.9m and that restructuring talks were still taking place. It
made a loss of Pounds 17.1m for the 18 months to March 31. Dealers said they
were equally mystified by the shares' rise.
Carlton Communications gained 6 in pre-market trading after reporting
half-year profits of Pounds 55.1m, in line with most expectations. However,
once the reassurance had been felt there was nothing else to latch on to and
the shares were pulled back to close a penny down at 733p.
