FT  27 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow recovers ground lost by
broker's error


   By PATRICK HARVERSON


   NEW YORK


Wall Street
US STOCK markets ended a listless session in positive territory yesterday,
but the lack of good news on the economy kept gains to a minimum, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 8.28 at 3,267.67. The
more broadly based Standard & Poor's 500 was just 0.34 firmer at 407.86. In
contrast, the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks slipped 4.08 to
615.40. Turnover on the New York SE was light at 176.7m shares, and declines
narrowly outpaced rises by 840 to 767.
Early gains had been expected when the market opened, primarily because the
previous session's loss was due entirely to a clerical error at Salomon
Brothers, the securities house, which initiated a heavy computer sell
program in the final minutes of trading, wiping 12 points off the Dow.
Salomon's subsequent attempts to rectify the mistake - which would involve
the firm buying back millions of dollars worth of shares - and the
realisation that stock prices were actually on an upward course on Wednesday
in spite of the loss on the Dow, meant that trading got off to a positive
start.
Yet the market struggled to sustain its upward momentum, and sentiment was
not helped by news of a slightly bigger than expected 15,000 rise in weekly
jobless claims.
American Express firmed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 24 in volume of 5.2m shares
after Smith Barney Harris Upham, the broking house, upgraded its rating on
the stock from a 'hold' to a 'buy'.
The Smith Barney analyst likes the stock because of the strong contribution
to earnings from the group's Shearson Lehman stockbroking subsidiary, and
more competitive pricing and cost-cutting at American Express's
travel-related services unit.
Commodore International featured after trading in the stock was halted due
to an imbalance of buy orders. When business resumed, the stock jumped
Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 15 3/4 amid speculation - started on a morning
television broadcast - that the computer manufacturer could be a takeover
target. One of the names mentioned as a possible suitor was Nintendo, of
Japan.
Glenfed plunged Dollars 1 7/8 , or more than a third, to Dollars 3 1/2 on
news that the savings and loan group's non-performing assets and
restructured loans increased by 11 per cent in January and February.
On the over-the-counter market, Borland International dropped a further
Dollars 5 1/4 to Dollars 56 3/4 in heavy trading after Shearson Lehman cut
its fourth-quarter earnings forecast from an originally estimated 20 cents a
share to just 5 cents. Borland shares have fallen 17 per cent this week,
partly on the news that Microsoft International was entering the market for
database management software.
Canada
GAINS IN bank issues and real estate and construction shares offset losses
in other sectors, keeping the Toronto market flat. Nervousness over Olympia
& York's debt levels and cash flow situation continued to abate.
The composite index closed only 3.8 off at 3,448.5 after fluctuating within
a 12-point range during the session. Falls slightly outnumbered rises by 281
to 271 after volume of 30.1m shares valued at CDollars 297m.
Gulf Resources Canada rose CDollars  3/4 to CDollars 6 in heavy trade on
speculation that a foreign oil company may buy O & Y's 74 per cent stake in
the company. The government lifted restrictions limiting foreign ownership
of oil and gas firms on Wednesday.
