FT  11 APR 92 / Books: Working class hero


   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD


MY LIFE IN POLITICS by Willy Brandt Hamish Hamilton, Pounds 20, 498 pages
WILLY BRANDT is one of the three great statesmen of postwar Europe. The
others are Konrad Adenauer and Charles de Gaulle, to whom Brandt pays
tribute - although more to the Frenchman than his fellow German. All three
saw the Franco-German relationship as crucial to European peace.
Where Brandt differed is that he came of working class origins and belonged
to the democratic left almost from the start. No one should underestimate
the tribulations of Adenauer and de Gaulle, but Brandt probably had a harder
life, as full of downs as ups, and sometimes vilified by his own people. He
survived, to develop the fruits of their labours and to make decisive
contributions of his own.
It is typical of the man that he has produced a somewhat rambling political
life. He notes that it is 'simpler to write a book alone than with dozen
other people'. That is what he seems to have done. My Life in Politics is
Brandt writing personally rather than another Brandt Report. The book jumps
all over the place, starting with the crises in postwar Berlin, reverting to
childhood, moving to his role in government, then covering his remarkably
long political after-life following his resignation as Federal Chancellor in
1974.
Yet the theme of a peaceful Germany in harmony with its neighbours is never
far away. Brandt's aim was no less than that, and probably no more. German
unification would never have come about so quickly without the emergence of
Gorbachev. But Brandt's policy of 'small steps' helped clear the way, as did
the policies of Adenauer and de Gaulle before him. In these memoirs it is
impossible not to detect a perceived continuity.
Adenauer saw his task as the first federal chancellor in cementing relations
with the west and making Germany respectable. He told Brandt that the Soviet
Union would not be able to stand up to pressures from both China and the
west indefinitely: therefore changes in eastern Europe might come
eventually. De Gaulle pondered movement east of the Elbe before most Germans
seriously began to contemplate it. Brandt salutes him: 'He had ventured to
think Utopian thoughts of a permanently peaceful Europe . . . In his
perceptions, he came closer to a whole Europe than any of those who wanted
to adapt too fast and too permanently to the postwar landscape.'
What most people outside failed to understand was how firm relations between
Bonn and Paris had become. That was particularly true of the British. Brandt
tells how George Brown, as foreign secretary, said: 'Willy, you must get us
into Europe, so we can take the lead.' He admits that 'in common with
leading British politicians' he did not see Britain as an essential part of
Europe except in times of war. It was France that mattered.
So did Poland. While Adenauer thought that Europe stopped at the Elbe and
drew the curtains at Magdeburg 'so he did not have to see the steppes of
Asia', Brandt believed that the same historical rank had to be given to
reconciliation between Germans and Poles as between Germans and French. That
was one of his great achievements as chancellor.
Brandt attaches special importance to place. He thinks that Adenauer was
governed by being a Rhinelander and considered himself 'more a west German
than simply a German.' Coming from Lubeck and spending his formative years
in voluntary exile in Scandinavia, Brandt was subject to different
influences. That affected both his view of Germany and social democracy: he
regrets that he has not been given enough credit for his role as a reforming
chancellor in domestic policy - following the Swedish model.
We should not take the geographical influence too far. Helmut Schmidt came
from nearby Hamburg, and did not have the same views on social democracy.
Brandt says that the difference there was one of temperament; both Brandt
and Schmidt at times must have both been prickly to work with.
There is a bitter chapter on Brandt's resignation as chancellor after the
discovery of an east German spy on his personal staff. He writes now that he
should never have gone. That does not accord with his mood of the time, when
he seemed exhausted. It is also odd that he should poke fun at Ludwig Erhard
for having asked, as economics minister, how much it would cost to buy East
Germany from the Russians. After all, that is nearly what happened in the
end.
