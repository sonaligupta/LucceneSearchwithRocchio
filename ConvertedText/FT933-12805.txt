FT  22 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Northern Telecom


Northern Telecom's foray into Europe always looked badly timed. By writing
down the value of its investment in STC the company has admitted as much.
Price erosion in the US is the main culprit behind yesterday's
second-quarter trading loss, but conditions in Europe have scarcely been
better since Nortel took a shine to STC in 1990. Having failed to build a
bridgehead in continental Europe as well, it has been if anything more
exposed than the indigenous competition.
While Nortel's overseas business will bear its share of restructuring,
though, restoring North America to profit will be the priority. Cutting
costs is an obvious first move. Making up lost ground in product and service
standards may prove more challenging. The drive to improve software
standards is overdue, but that effort could end up costing more than the
Dollars 158m (Pounds 105.3m) provided yesterday.
On that basis, the decision to sell STC's submarine cables business makes
perfect sense. Despite turning in decent profits, the business was never
much of a fit with Nortel's interests in switching and transmission
equipment. Disposal should bring in more than enough to cover the cash costs
of restructuring and software development. Always assuming, that is, that
the competition authorities in London and Brussels are happy to see Alcatel
leap-frog AT&T to take the lead in submarine cables.
