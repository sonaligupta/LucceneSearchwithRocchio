FT  28 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Bid talk surrounds Racal


   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and COLIN MILLHAM


Very heavy turnover in security and telecommunications group Racal
Electronics, combined with a rise in the share price against the market,
prompted a number of market observers to cast around for a bidder.
The shares were the most heavily traded in the London market yesterday with
more than 13.5m dealt and they rose 3 1/4 to 58 1/4 p. This followed a rise
of 2p on turnover of 10m on Thursday.
Market commentators believe that industrial conglomerate Tomkins, which was
previously thought to have offered around Pounds 500m for Racal's Chubb
subsidiary, may launch a 65p a share bid for the whole company - possibly
next week.
In December Williams Holdings, which still holds 10 per cent of Racal made a
three-for-20 share offer which ultimately valued each Racal share at 54.8p.
Mr Brian Newman, an electronics specialist with agency broker Henderson
Crosthwaite said; 'Racal only just defeated the previous bid and if Tomkins
were to bid at 65p they would stand a good chance.'
Barclays slide
Concern over its debt exposure affected Barclays Bank which slumped 13 to
322p on particularly heavy turnover of more than 10m shares.
Property company Heron International said it was seeking the extension of
maturity dates for some of its debts of at least Pounds 1.3bn. The market
estimates that Barclays is owed around Pounds 250m.
There is also a feeling that Barclay's exposure to troubled Canadian
property company Olympia & York could be greater than feared.
However, Mr John Aitken, a banking analyst at County NatWest said that,
after conversations with the bank, he had good reason to believe the Heron
figure was more in the region of Pounds 125m.
He added that most of the clearing banks would have an exposure.
The news comes at a time when it was hoped that most of the banks' bad debt
news was already out in the open and discounted. NatWest Bank, which some
observers said could have a Pounds 150m exposure to the Heron debt, fell 7
to 280p.
Waters gain
Water stocks, perhaps the most sensitive sector to the political climate,
shrugged off yesterday's disappointing opinion poll news for the
Conservative government. The shares resisted a weak market, showing small
gains, as BZW said that although political risk has added uncertainty in the
short term little change in policy is likely in the immediate few months
after the general election, regardless of who leads the government.
Smith New Court recently pointed out that water companies will have to spend
about Pounds 40bn in nominal terms in the next ten years and that a Labour
government could not realistically take on this investment programme.
Southern gained 6 to 326p, with Thames up 2 at 446p, while Seven Trent and
North West both put on a penny to 323p and 342p respectively. Wessex, the
weakest performing water stock earlier this month, continued to recover on
the back of its waste disposal joint venture, rising 4 to 398p.
Lonrho weak again
Conglomerate Lonrho fell for the second day running following Thursday's
sale to Libya of a stake in its Metropole hotel chain, and a profit forecast
cut from its broker.
UBS Phillips & Drew reduced its 1992 profit estimate by Pounds 25m to Pounds
125m for the year to end September after Lonrho warned of a tough first half
at its annual meeting on Thursday. The house also reduced its dividend
forecast by 2p to 8p. Lonrho's shares fell 8 to 87p on heavy turnover of
more than 10m shares.
Midland Bank bucked a weak market to rise 2 1/2 p to 350p after news that
the Hongkong Shanghai Banking Corporation, which hopes to merge with
Midland, had reached an agreement in principle for a dual primary listing in
Hong Kong and London.
More analysts cut their forecasts on TSB. County NatWest reduced its 1992
forecast by Pounds 60m to Pounds 200m and the shares slipped 2 to 128p.
Royal Bank of Scotland fell 10 to 164p after two securities houses turned
negative on the stock.
SG Warburg reduced its forecast for the year ending September 1992 by Pounds
50m to Pounds 80m and maintained the stock as a hold but was not prepared to
comment on reasons behind the change. Also, Smith New Court recommended a
switch out of Royal Bank into Bank of Scotland arguing that the latter had
underperformed Royal Bank by 18 per cent over the past quarter. Bank of
Scotland was unchanged at 105p.
Conglomerate Trafalgar House rose 8 to 127p after traders were caught with
short positions following an abortive bear raid earlier in the week. Oner of
the US investment banks was said to be among those short of stock as a brisk
1.8m shares changed hands.
Aero-engine maker Rolls-Royce, denying any industrial trouble at its Derby
plant, edged a penny to 155p.
Late talk in the market hinted that Eurotunnel, which had advanced this week
on hopes that it would join the CAC-40 index in Paris, is close to agreeing
terms with its contractors over the payment of extra costs for building the
Channel tunnel.
Sketchy details emerging suggested that agreement had been reached on Pounds
400m of the Pounds 1.2bn claimed by the contracting consortium TML - and
that no equity stake was involved. It is believed that TML is likely to
settle for around 70 per cent of the remaining Pounds 800m. The shares
slipped a penny to 438p.
Food companies and supermarket groups showed defensive attractions at a time
of political uncertainty. A positive note from UBS Phillips & Drew continued
to support J. Sainsbury, up 3 at 390p, with Wm Morrison climbing another 6
to 334p, following Thursday's good figures, Kwik Save gaining 4 to 543p and
Tesco 1 1/2 to 257 1/2 p. A buy recommendation from County NatWest helped
lift Booker 7 to 437p.
A bad week for Euro Disney ended with the shares a further 22 off at 1523p.
The stock has been weak following adverse press comment and a downgrade by
Goldman Sachs.
Profit-taking in Rank Organisation, which had benefited on Thursday from a
Smith New Court buy recommendation, saw the leisure group tumble 14 to 646p.
Troubled gambling machine group Kunick was busy after Mason Hill Asset
Management of New York bought a 5.6 per cent stake in the 8.25p Preference
Shares. The ordinaries lost a halfpenny to 7p in volume of 1.2m.
There was renewed, but largely disregarded, bid talk surrounding the holiday
group stocks, with the focus on Airtours, a penny easier at 264p, Eurocamp,
2 firmer at 308p, and Owners Abroad off 2 at 107 1/2 p.
Continuing caution over its Virgin deal saw Thorn EMI 10 adrift at 730p.
Monument Oil & Gas was one of the market's heaviest traded stocks, with a
block of 5m shares said to have been sold into the market.
The shares settled  1/2 off at 29 1/4 p.
