FT  05 AUG 92 / Letter: Cure for a malaise


   From K D REED


Sir, None of Barry Riley's listed drugs (The Long View, August 1) has
produced a cure for the current national malaise of Meddlomania. This
wasting disease is easily diagnosed from cries in the media of 'Do
something, no matter what' at times of economic stress emitted by opposition
and panicking politicians and failing businessmen.
The old fashioned remedy of hard work and cold showers is seldom tried for
long enough, but when used with conviction it can produce strengthening of
the system and an improvement in efficiency that provides the necessary
competitiveness. Unfortunately, fashionable Freudian tendencies always to
blame a third party have caused this simple remedy to be omitted from later
editions of the British Economicapae.
