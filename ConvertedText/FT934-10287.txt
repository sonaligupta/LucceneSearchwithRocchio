FT  06 NOV 93 / French confidence in currency returns


   By DAVID BUCHAN

THE monetary authorities of Germany as well as France believe that 'sooner
or later' the French franc will strengthen on the foreign exchange markets
enough to return to its set central rate of FFr3.35 to the D-Mark, France's
Treasury chief, Mr Christian Noyer, claimed yesterday.
Mr Noyer's declaration to the press was the first time since the August
upheaval in the European Monetary System that the French authorities have
dared to detail publicly their hopes for the franc's future rate.
His statement reflects a return in official confidence, following recent
indicators that the French economy's current recession may not be as deep or
long as previously feared, and after a meeting of the Franco-German economic
and financial council this week.
Referring to the meeting, Mr Noyer claimed: 'There is not the shadow of a
doubt in the minds of all those in the German Finance Ministry and in the
Bundesbank that the equilibrium rate (for the franc), to which one will
return sooner or later, is the central rate.'
The August crisis in the EMS did not alter the franc/Mark central rate, but
widened the margin, from 2.25 to 15 per cent, by which the two currencies
could fluctuate either side of this central pivot. The franc, whose
pre-August floor against the D-Mark was FFr3.43, has since several times
sunk to a rate of FFr 3.50 or more, but was yesterday trading at FFr3.47.
Voicing a renewed confidence that, over time, France's lower inflation,
solid trade surplus and comparative competitiveness would work in the
franc's favour, Mr Noyer said that if real purchasing power were taken into
account, the franc's rate could even be above FFr3.35.
