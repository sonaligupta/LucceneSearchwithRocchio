FT  04 MAR 94 / Survey of World Tyre Industry (4): A spectacular leap
forward - John Griffiths discusses a revolution in manufacturing technology


   By JOHN GRIFFITHS


A revolution in tyre manufacturing technology, the seeds of which were sown
in the mid-1980s, is gaining momentum.
Purely in terms of technical capability, the industry's leading companies
are approaching the point where they could automate their tyre-making
processes to something approaching 'lights out' levels, at least for
mainstream products such as popular replacement market car tyre sizes
produced in long runs with relatively little variation in specification.
This represents a spectacular leap forward for an industry where, for most
of its history, successful automation has proved elusive.
Right up to the mid-1980s the laminating and completion of each carcass was
carried out manually even though parts of the processes involved were
progressively automated, such as the feeding from reels of the various
laminates which provide both strength and the bed for the tread,
That the new technologies and processes which have been appearing since the
late 1980s - and which appear to have been taken a quantum step further at a
flagship plant at Michelin's Clermont-Ferrand headquarters  - will not
immediately sweep all before them appears to be largely due to commercial
rather than technological factors.
The massive wave of investment in new facilities and capacity made by the
industry during the eight-year motor industry boom until 1990, and which
totalled several billion dollars, will take a long time to be amortised. So
investment in the 'revolutionary' processes can only be progressive.
Michelin executives, who in the past couple of years have cast off part at
least of the shroud of secrecy which has covered the activities of the
world's biggest tyre maker, maintain that a quantum leap really is at hand.
The Clermont-Ferrand plant, which went on stream in January, occupies only
about one-tenth the space of a conventional tyre-making facility. Precise
details are far from clear, including its capacity, but there has been an
industry rush for the patents Michelin has taken out on the processes.
One key ingredient is dispensing with the previous necessity - and all the
plant and equipment - to make a number of individual components of the tyre
in semi-finished form away from the actual assembly site. It is this which
accounts primarily for the substantial space-saving, and which may have
almost as profound consequences in terms of process energy-saving.
The actual tyre-building uses a rotating drum system on which the carcass is
laid from plies fed automatically from stock drums, which can be tracked
above the rotating embryo carcass to ensure the right ply is laid in the
correct position.
Called the C3M system, for reasons also not entirely clear, one of its most
valued attributes is its flexibility. With the tyre market fragmenting into
ever greater varieties of tyres, in proliferating sizes, and with product
life cycles coming down from a decade to closer to five years as competition
intensifies, such flexibility is likely to prove decisive in terms of
competitive advantage in the medium term. According to one executive, 'it
just about eliminates work in progress and can switch from one tyre to
another in a heart beat'.
The ramifications are not lost on Michelin's work force, which has fallen
from a world total of 140,000 at the start of the 1990s to 125,000 now, with
more job losses to come.
The new facility employs just 50 people. Although its output is unknown, the
effectiveness of the technology is such that Michelin is looking very hard
indeed at the implications for employees. 'There is a social concern to this
which must be addressed,' observes one executive. 'Some have described
Michelin as the biggest mama's and papa's shop in the world and we have to
take account of employees' interests in phasing this in.'
The apparent production breakthrough, however, has not thrown the fear into
the rest of the industry that an outside observer might expect.
Michelin's principal rivals maintain they, too, will be able to introduce
appropriate new technology as and when they deem it commercially viable.
'All the majors have been very focused on this area,' says Mr Bill Sharp,
president and general manager of Goodyear's European operations. 'It is more
a question of how quickly it is phased in in view of the very significant
capital expenditure involved.'
Pirelli's deputy-chairman, Mr Carlo Banchieri, takes a similar view. 'As for
revolution - it's difficult to give a precise answer. Capacity investments
in the 1980s' boom were huge. Today, when the industry is operating at
around 70 per cent of capacity, it is difficult to justify totally new plant
which would also require further large amounts of research and development.
If I were a shareholder I would not be very happy unless the returns were
very good. In three, four, five years' time more flexible systems will exist
and we are working on them; but they will have to be in tandem with existing
automation.'
The Michelin innovation might be regarded as the fourth generation of the
automation systems which have been introduced to the industry since the late
1980s.
Pirelli itself was widely regarded as a front-runner with what can now be
regarded as third generation technology introduced at its Bollate plant near
Milan in 1989.
Now closely replicated at its Breuberg facility in Germany, the system
incorporates a 100-metre long assembly line traversed by the building drum,
with the tyres' individual components applied automatically. At the end of
the line the collapsible drum returns to start another cycle by means of an
underground conveyor. It is a system, maintains Mr Banchieri which, 'with
minor improvements and adaptations we can be very competitive'.
