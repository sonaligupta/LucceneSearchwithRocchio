FT  21 NOV 92 / Briefcase, Q&A: So who gets the house?


MY WIFE and I own our house jointly and we should like to arrange our
affairs so that, if she dies before me, she could leave her half to our
children. It appears to be easy to do this in England by substituting a
tenancy in common for a joint tenancy. But what about Scotland?
The Scottish legal system does not recognise the concepts of a tenancy in
common or joint tenancies. But it is possible to incorporate a survivorship
destination in the disposition (ie, deed) of the property.
If the disposition says it is in favour of you both equally, and to the
survivor, then the half share of the person who dies first goes
automatically to the surviving spouse.
If however, the disposition is to you both without any reference to
survivorship, then either is entitled to leave their half share to whoever
they wish.
If there is no reference to survivorship, then you both are entitled to
leave your half share to whoever you wish by drawing up individual wills.
If you find there is a survivorship destination, this can be evacuated if it
is the wish of both parties. You should consult a solicitor in that regard.

soon as possible.
