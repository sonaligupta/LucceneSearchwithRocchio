Wilhelm Verwoerd, grandson of former South African prime minister Hendrik
Verwoerd, the main architect of apartheid, has joined Nelson Mandela's
African National Congress, South Africa's Sunday Times reported, Reuter
reports from Johannesburg.
It quoted his wife Melanie as saying: 'We hope our work within the ANC will,
in some small way, make up for the hurt caused to so many people by Dr
Verwoerd, the Verwoerd name and the policy of apartheid which he
personified.'
Hendrik Verwoerd was prime minister from 1958 until he was assassinated in
1966.
