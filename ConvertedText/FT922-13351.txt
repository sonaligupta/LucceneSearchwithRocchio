FT  11 APR 92 / Criticism over revenue disclosure


   By ANDREW JACK


FEW COMPANIES disclose enough information about their revenues in annual
reports, according to a survey of 50 companies in construction and
contracting.
The survey by Company Reporting, the Edinburgh-based monitoring service of
accounts, says that only 28 companies in its survey specified how income was
spread over the life of a contract.
Revenue recognition policies - which determine over what period revenues
should be included in the accounts - vary considerably between companies and
sectors.
Revenue may be recognised at differing times in accounts, such as after
completion of contracts, invoicing, delivery of goods or receipt of cash.
The different policies adopted can have a significant impact on the figures
produced in accounts.
In a separate analysis of 34 companies in the business-services sector, it
finds at least eight with evidence of revenue from long-term contracts, of
which three do not show how revenue is accounted for.
Auditors are persuading clients to disclose more information on accounting
policies that can give a misleading impression that there has been a
material change, Company Reporting warns.
It quotes KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm, which for the first time
instructed Macarthy, the pharmaceuticals group, to include a statement last
year that research and development expenditure is capitalised, although
there had been no change in its accounting.
