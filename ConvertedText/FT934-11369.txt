FT  01 NOV 93 / Stanhope to seek new equity in refinancing


   By BETHAN HUTTON


THE board of Stanhope, the heavily-indebted commercial property developer,
said yesterday it was considering raising new equity in a refinancing.
The company is looking to raise Pounds 150m-Pounds 160m, and to restructure
its banking arrangements, but said plans were still in very early stages. No
proposals have yet been put to any of the 16 or so banks involved. Stanhope
last refinanced its bank debt in January this year. At Friday's closing
share price of 36p, it had a market capitalisation of just under Pounds 60m.
The likelihood of attracting investors was helped by Broadgate Properties,
50 per cent owned by Stanhope, last week selling the lease of One Exchange
Square, home of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, for
Pounds 170m. Stanhope also reports a 'significant increase' in letting
enquiries at both Broadgate and Ludgate, another of its developments.
Any restructuring is likely to involve Stanhope taking control of the other
half of Broadgate Properties, which was owned by Rosehaugh, now in
receivership.
Stanhope said the refinancing would take three or four months.
It incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds 215m in the year to June 30, 1992.
Results for the year to June 30, 1993 are due in mid-November, but the
company said improvements in the market 'have come too late to be reflected
in these figures'.
