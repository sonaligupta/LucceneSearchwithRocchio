FT  06 AUG 93 / Germany's forex reserves expand


   By ANDREW FISHER


   FRANKFURT


GERMANY'S foreign exchange reserves were swollen by nearly DM8bn (Pounds
3.1bn) last week as a result of speculative currency inflows, but this
figure does not yet include the full impact of the Bundesbank's intervention
to prop up the French franc, the Bundesbank said in its weekly statement.
This omission is because of the usual delay in reporting foreign exchange
transactions. The support operations involving the German central bank at
the end of July will thus show up in next week's statement, it said.
The DM7.7bn rise in reserves, mostly reflecting Bundesbank currency
intervention, brought the total up to DM118.6bn. However, Mr Helmut
Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, said on Monday that the central bank's
intervention had led to inflows of DM60bn last month, nearly half of this on
Friday.
After the currency markets chaos and the widening of fluctuation bands in
the European exchange rate mechanism, the Bundesbank has started to mop up
the excess liquidity to try to prevent further growth in the money supply
and price inflation.
In this week's securities repurchase (repo) operations with commercial
banks, it drained DM38bn of liquidity from the system.
