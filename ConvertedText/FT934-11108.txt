FT  02 NOV 93 / International Company News: Compaq launches new products

   SAN FRANCISCO


COMPAQ Computer yesterday launched an array of new personal computer
products and slashed the prices of some its models by 10 to 23 per cent.
The large number of new models reflects increasing segmentation in the
personal computer market, with separate product lines aimed at different
distribution channels and types of customers, from individual purchasers to
large corporate buyers.
Other PC companies, including Apple and IBM, are following a similar
strategy with different 'brands' or lines of products targeted at various
segments of the market.
Compaq's new products for business users include high performance desktop
PCs based on Intel's latest Pentium microprocessors, with prices starting at
Dollars 2,799.
Other new models include energy-saving features that can significantly cut
electricity consumption and costs in offices. New ProLinea models, with
built-in PC networking capabilities start at about Dollars 1,350.
Compaq also stepped up its presence in the rapidly-growing consumer PC
market with the introduction of 10 new models to its Presario family. These
include models with stereo sound and video capabilities and pre-installed
software. Prices start at about Dollars 1,650.
'With the launch of these new PCs for home and business users, Compaq
continues to play a key strategic role in the emergence of these two
distinct, but equally important PC markets,' said Mr John Rose,
vice-president and general manager, desktop PC division.
The company, which recently reported a 64 per cent rise in 1993
third-quarter revenues to Dollars 1.75bn and net income more than doubled to
Dollars 107m, also said yesterday that its third-quarter sales in Japan had
increased by 350 per cent.
