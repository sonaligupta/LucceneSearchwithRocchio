FT  13 NOV 92 / Australia unveils programme to create more jobs


   By KEVIN BROWN


AUSTRALIA'S Labor government early today unveiled a jobs creation programme,
after a bigger-than-expected rise in unemployment to a post-war record of
11.3 per cent.
Mr John Dawkins, federal treasurer, said the bulk of the jobs programme
involved reallocating funding already announced for other projects. But
there would be additional total spending of ADollars 39m (Pounds 17.7m)  -
ADollars 8m in the current financial year to next June 30 and ADollars 31m
in the 1993-94 financial year.
The jobs plan was outlined after Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, asked
the federal cabinet to raise spending on training and bring forward
infrastructure projects.
Mr Keating said yesterday the economy was recovering slowly from recession,
but the government would 'press on with an expansionary fiscal policy to
deal with unemployment'.
Economists said the government's room for manoeuvre was limited by its need
to restrain growth in the forecast budget deficit of ADollars 13.4bn (Pounds
6bn), compared with ADollars 9.3bn in 1991-92.
Easier monetary policy was thought unlikely because of the weakness of the
Australian dollar, which has fallen about 13 per cent against the US dollar
since November 1991.
Most commentators expected unemployment to increase in October from the
September level of 10.8 per cent. But none forecast that the rate would
exceed the previous post-war record of 11.1 per cent in June.
The government said the increase was due to a change in the statistical
method used to calculate the figures and a rise in the participation rate,
which measures the proportion of the workforce seeking work.
The size of the jobless rise put an end to speculation that Mr Keating might
call a federal election before Christmas to capitalise on recent improvement
in Labor's popularity.
