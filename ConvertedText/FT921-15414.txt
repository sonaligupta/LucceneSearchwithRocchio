FT  10 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Dual trading demand at CME


   By BARBARA DURR


   CHICAGO


THE CHICAGO Mercantile Exchange is being asked by its membership to restore
the controversial practice of dual trading.
Dual trading, which was restricted by the CME last May, is when brokers can
trade for their own as well as for customers' accounts. It is widely
considered by regulators and the US Congress to make fraud easier in the
commodities markets. Legislation pending in Congress would curb dual trading
in US futures markets.
The CME, the first exchange to curb the practice, is under pressure to
reconsider its policy after several hundred floor brokers and traders signed
letters in recent weeks demanding its return. The CME's board of governors
was to hold a meeting on the issue late yesterday with the exchange's full
membership.
Members were expected to express their desire to overturn the restrictions
on dual trading.
These currently ban the practice for futures in which a daily average volume
of 10,000 contracts has been achieved for six months. Consequently,
two-thirds of all trades at the exchange, including its stock index,
currency and Eurodollar futures, are covered by the ban.
CME brokers and traders complain that market liquidity has been negatively
affected and that customers were suffering from poorer prices for their
orders. Profits for the brokers and their customers were reportedly down.
A decision on the policy could come at the next CME board meeting on January
22. If the board does not act, it could face a petition for a referendum on
the rule change from the floor.
