FT  22 APR 91 / International Company News: Marketchief loan restructure


   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent


ONE OF the biggest property restructuring packages in recent times has been
arranged between Barclays and Marketchief, the consortium that took over
Imry Merchant Developers for Pounds 314m in July, 1989.
Mr Stephan Wingate, chairman of Marketchief, said that Barclays had agreed
to take 'a medium/longterm view' of the Pounds 200m loan that was originally
expected to be paid back from the sale of Imry's investment assets.
In its first year, Marketchief made disposals of about Pounds 100m but
stopped when the property market deteriorated. 'Everyone agreed that it was
not sensible to sell,' said Mr Wingate.
He said the package did not involve disposals until prices improved or a
moratorium on development. Selling at current prices was, he said, 'out of
the question'.
In addition to the Barclays loan, the original deal was financed by Eagle
Star, Prudential Bache, Mr Wolfgang Stolzenberg, a Canadian investor, and by
Mr Wingate's own vehicle, Development & Realisation Trust. DRT has already
written off its Pounds 1.25m investment.
Imry Merchant is perhaps best known for erecting an office block on top of
Shakespeare's Rose Theatre in Southwark.
