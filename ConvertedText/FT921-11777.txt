FT  30 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Probe into Imro's supervision of BIM


   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent


A PARLIAMENTARY Select Committee is to question officials of the Investment
Management Regulatory Organisation, the quasi-governmental self-regulatory
body, about its role in supervising the fund manager of the Maxwell
companies' pensions funds.
Officials of Imro will appear before the Select Committee on Social Security
some time within the next two weeks. The committee, chaired by Mr Frank
Field MP, will question the regulators about how the fund managers became
authorised to conduct investment business and how their activities were
supervised thereafter.
Earlier this week, members of the Maxwell Private Companies Pension Fund
Members Association, charged that Imro had failed to protect the public. Mr
Kenneth Trench, chairman of the group, cited press reports that Imro had
visited the premises of Bishopsgate Investment Management  - the funds'
investment manager - only six weeks before Mr Maxwell's death and found no
problems. Since then, auditors have found hundreds of millions of assets
missing from the pension funds managed by BIM.
The pensioners questioned whether BIM's ownership had been properly
investigated prior to authorisation. Mr Trench noted that it is owned by a
charitable organisation which is based in Liechtenstein and appeared to be
controlled by the late Mr Robert Maxwell.
