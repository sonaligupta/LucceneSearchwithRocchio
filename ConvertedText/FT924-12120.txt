FT  22 OCT 92 / Observer: Sir Nigel ups anchor


So what next for Sir Nigel Broackes? While kicking them upstairs might be
the best way of dealing with interfering old age pensioners like Lord Forte,
Broackes is still only 58. And at that age, a man who founded a Pounds
4bn-plus turnover company will scarcely be kept occupied by an honorary
president's position.
There is a widespread view that Sir Nigel had taken his eye off the ball
some time ago, and this helps explain the company's current parlous
condition. Even so, the speed with which the company's founder has been
dumped is rather unseemly. He gets to keep his office, secretary and car but
not much else. Nor - unlike Lord Hanson as well as Forte - can he bask in
the reflected glow of a company named after him.
While admitting that the events of the last few weeks have been traumatic,
he is already busy planning. A fortnight on Monday he sets sail in his 155ft
ketch, Mikado, for the West Indies. First port of call will be the Antigua
Charter Agents Show. When one loses one's job, putting one's yacht out to
charter has its advantages.
Beyond that, who knows? After all, the late oil tycoon Armand Hammer did not
get involved with Occidental until he was 57. For the moment, however, it
looks as though Sir Nigel is less interested in commerce than in broadly
cultural matters.
