YAMAHA Motor, the world's second largest motorcycle maker, yesterday
reported a 48.8 per cent fall to Y2.57bn (Dollars 20.8m) of parent-company
pre-tax profits in the half-year to September, from Y5.03bn a year earlier.
Although Yamaha's export sales were almost unchanged at Y132bn, domestic
sales slipped by 14.2 per cent to Y92.77bn, reflecting the weak state of
consumer spending in Japan. Total sales were down by 6.5 per cent to
Y224.83bn.
Total motorcycle sales fell from 454,000 to 429,000 units, although within
the total export sales rose by 9,000 units to 213,000. Weak sales to Europe
were balanced by stronger markets in Asia and North America. The total value
of motorcycle sales fell by Y3.67bn to Y108.6bn.
Sales of marine equipment, such as outboard motors and leisure craft, were
down sharply from Y53.49bn to Y44.01bn.
Sales of special equipment - such as golf carts, generators, and ski
vehicles - were healthier, up from Y26.17bn to Y30.22bn. Sales of car
engines to car manufacturers slipped by Y3.49bn to Y17.19bn.
The company said the outlook was bleak.
