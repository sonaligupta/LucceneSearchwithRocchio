FT  17 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Vietnam fund cut-off date
extended


   By REUTER


   HONG KONG


CREDIT Lyonnais Securities (Asia) has extended the cut-off date for placing
its newly-launched Vietnam Growth Fund due to a disappointing take-up,
Reuter reports from Hong Kong.
The securities firm said: 'It is taking longer to place than we had hoped.
The placement period is being extended and the reason for this is the
unusual nature of the fund.' The new deadline will be April 11.
The closed-end, 25-year fund for direct investment in Vietnam had only
raised about Dollars 25m of the targeted Dollars 50m by the January 14
deadline, sources familiar with the fund said, though CLSA declined to say
how much had been raised.
Launched in November, it is the first fund authorised to invest directly in
Vietnamese companies and is aimed at institutional investors with a minimum
investment of Dollars 525,000.
