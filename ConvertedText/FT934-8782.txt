FT  13 NOV 93 / International Company News: Astra lifted by stronger sales


   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES


POWERFUL sales growth helped Astra, the Swedish pharmaceuticals group, lift
pre-tax profits by 69 per cent to SKr5.78bn (Dollars 713m) in the first nine
months.
The figure was higher than expected, helping the group's A shares to rise
SKr3 to SKr170.
Sales for the latest period rose 43 per cent to SKr16.1bn, due to a 20 per
cent increase in volumes and the effects of a weaker Swedish krona.
Operating profits at SKr4.73bn were 54 per cent ahead. However, the pre-tax
rise was even bigger as the weaker krona helped to swell financial income to
SKr985m from SKr288m.
Sales were up 50 per cent in the UK and 58 per cent in France.
In Germany, the company's largest single market, there was a 5 per cent
downturn, reflecting the country's general healthcare cost-containment
squeeze.
Losec, the anti-peptic ulcer agent, again dominated the performance, with a
65 per cent rise in sales to SKr5.06bn.
Total sales, including those through licensees, were up 64 per cent at
SKr9.10bn.
Pulmicort, Astra's anti-asthma agent, saw a 54 per cent increase in sales to
SKr2.08bn.
The group said full-year sales growth would continue at the same level as in
the first nine months.
However, it reiterated previous warnings that profits growth would be slower
over the rest of the year because of the effect that currency gains had on
the final-quarter performance in 1992.
