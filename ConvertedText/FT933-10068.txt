FT  06 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Argentina's Inflation falls to lowest
level in 24 years


   By JOHN BARHAM


Inflation in Argentina has fallen to its lowest level in 24 years, reaching
a monthly rate of just 0.3 per cent in July, the government announced,
writes John Barham.
Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, said the fall meant Argentina's
inflation was converging with 'those of developed countries'. Achieving
inflation rates close to international levels has been one of Mr Cavallo's
overriding objectives.
In April 1991, he pegged Argentina's peso to the dollar, and has been
striving since then to lower inflation to US levels and avoid an irreparable
overvaluation of the peso.
However, improved price stability seems to have been achieved at the cost of
rising unemployment and deteriorating external accounts. Although exports
are improving, imports are increasing at a much faster rate. The first
quarter trade deficit rose 57 per cent to Dollars 511m (Pounds 343m).
According to preliminary government data, unemployment rose to 8.9 per cent
in May against 6.9 per cent a year earlier. Underemployment is estimated at
a further 10 per cent. These are the highest rates in 20 years and rival
unemployment during the 1989-90 crisis of hyperinflation.
