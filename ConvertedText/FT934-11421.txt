FT  01 NOV 93 / Accuracy of trade figures queried


   By PETER MARSH


MEASURES to improve the European Community's new system of collecting trade
statistics are to be discussed next week by government officials from the
UK, France, Germany and the Netherlands, Peter Marsh writes.
Pressure for the meeting has come particularly from the UK, which is
concerned that the method of collecting data introduced at the beginning of
this year may be giving an inaccurate view of economic trends.
Even though data gathered so far this year about UK exports and imports
indicate Britain's trade gap may be worsening as the recovery picks up,
British officials are unsure about to what degree they can rely on the
statistics.
They are particularly worried that the problems may also be affecting the
collection of non-EC trade data and so distorting perceptions about the
whole-world trade deficit.
Last year the UK had a deficit on visible trade with the rest of the world
of Pounds 14bn, and the Treasury in its last published forecast in March
said this would rise to Pounds 21bn this year.
Officials from the UK's Central Statistical Office and the statistical
agencies of the other three nations will be discussing their experiences
with the new system and ways to improve it.
The new system, Intrastat, was introduced after the ending of trade barriers
between European Community countries meant Customs officials no longer
collected the data needed in compiling trade statistics.
A specific worry about the system - which is organised by Eurostat, the EC's
statistical agency - is that the companies sending in information about
their own imports and exports may be confusing goods bought and sold within
the EC with products traded outside it.
