FT  27 SEP 94 / UK Company News: UCM climbs 35% to Pounds 1.1m


Universal Ceramic Materials, the manufacturer of refractory and heating
element products, yesterday announced a 35 per cent increase in first half
1994 pre-tax profits from Pounds 837,000 to Pounds 1.13m, in its first set
of results as a quoted company.
UCM showed a 4 per cent increase in sales to Pounds 14.2m (Pounds 13.6m).
The sharper rise in profits was fuelled by the decision to turn down high
volume, but lower margin business in countries such as Mexico, Spain and
France.
Mr Bob Hughes, chief executive, said pricing competition continued to be
fierce. However, the outlook was encouraging with a competitor set to
withdraw from the industry by the end of the year.
There was no dividend. Earnings advanced by 14 per cent to 4.1p (3.6p).
