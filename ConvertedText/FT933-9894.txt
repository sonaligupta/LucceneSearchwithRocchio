FT  06 AUG 93 / Money Markets: High rates continue


THE central banks of France, Belgium and Denmark continued to keep
short-term interest rates high yesterday in their bid to preserve their
currencies' value against the D-Mark in the newly relaxed European exchange
rate mechanism, writes James Blitz.
The French authorities yesterday added FFr28.0bn of liquidity to the French
money markets and kept their intervention rate unchanged at 6.75 per cent.
Both moves were seen as a continuation of the action to keep monetary policy
tight for the time being to manage the French franc's exchange rate. The
liquidity injection was tiny compared with the DM38.1bn added by the
Bundesbank in its weekly operation on Wednesday. The Belgian and Danish
authorities also kept monetary conditions tight in money market trading
yesterday.
All these moves had a negative impact on interest rate markets, where there
had been a general expectation that monetary policy would be eased
everywhere except in Germany.
September French franc futures dropped 14 basis points on the day to 93.53.
The December contract fell 12 points to a close of 93.65. French three-month
money was trading between 11 1/2 per cent and 13 per cent for most of the
day, penalising any speculator with leveraged positions against the French
franc.
Sterling futures also fell back as dealers continued to be taken aback by
European monetary policy.
The September contract declined 3 basis points to finish at 94.23, but
December was that amount up at a close of 94.68. Dealers clearly think the
rate cut will probably come between autumn and winter.
Three-month sterling interest rates remained at 5 13/16 per cent against the
background of a very small shortage in the discount market of Pounds 450m.
However, there was continued confidence of rate reductions in Germany as
call money spent another day hovering below the discount rate level of 6.75
per cent.
So many D-Marks have been pumped into the German banking system in the last
fortnight that call money stood yesterday at 6.65 per cent. The September
Euromark contract ended at 93.53, up 6 basis points on the day, while the
December contract was 5 basis points higher at 94.12.
