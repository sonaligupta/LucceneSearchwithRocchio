FT  01 DEC 94 / Shares in downbeat Argyll drop 17p


   By NEIL BUCKLEY


A downbeat trading statement sent shares in Argyll, the grocery retailer,
down 17p to 255p - the biggest fall of the day among FT-SE 100 stocks - in
spite of a 4 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits. Profits before
tax for the 28 weeks to October 15 rose to Pounds 205.3m, from a restated
Pounds 197.3m.
The market was disappointed by a 0.8 per cent fall in like-for-like sales in
Argyll's Safeway chain in the past six weeks, in spite of an aggressive
marketing campaign. Analysts were also disappointed that the group did not
give more details of restructuring plans following a recent strategic
review.
Sir Alistair Grant, chairman, defended the group's achievement in
maintaining its operating margin at 7.1 per cent in a competitive market. He
suggested the fact that Safeway had increased sales 9 per cent but shown
only a small increase in market share suggested the total grocery market was
expanding more quickly than observers had predicted.
Mr Colin Smith, chief executive, said Safeway had adopted marketing
initiatives aimed at improving its range and price perceptions to attract
more young families. It had launched a Pounds 7m advertising campaign,
lowered prices, and introduced cut-price own-label products. Gross margins
had fallen about 0.1 points.
Further measures to improve efficiency would follow from the strategic
review, but details would not be given until the full-year results in May.
Total group sales increased 7 per cent from Pounds 3.14bn to Pounds 3.36bn.
Safeway's sales rose 9.3 per cent to Pounds 2.78bn, with a 9.6 per cent
growth from new stores offset by a 0.3 point fall in existing stores.
However, price falls of 0.5 per cent masked an underlying volume increase of
0.2 per cent in existing stores.
Safeway lifted operating profits 9 per cent to Pounds 186.2m, but sales
growth in the second half has slowed to 7.2 per cent, with a 0.8 per cent
decline in existing stores. Sales in Presto and Lo-Cost fell 3 per cent to
Pounds 583m, with operating profits un-changed at Pounds 20.9m. Part of the
decline resulted from the sale of the Lo-Cost chain and 28 Presto stores in
two deals worth Pounds 100m.
The interim dividend was lifted 4 per cent from 3.75p to 3.9p, with earnings
per share also up 4 per cent at 12.8p.
