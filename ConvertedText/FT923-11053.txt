FT  27 JUL 92 / Call for tighter audit rules


   By DAVID BARCHARD


A CALL for tighter controls on the ways companies operate so directors can
better assess their effectiveness is made today by the Chartered Institute
of Management Accountants in its response to the Cadbury Committee report on
corporate governance.
In particular the institute recommends a wide range of new measures to
improve the internal auditing of companies.
The institute says more importance should be given to the disclosure of
company liquidity and that interim reports should be improved to ensure good
accounting practices are observed throughout the year, not just at year-end.
'The balance sheet and profit and loss data should be augmented by a
reasonably detailed cash flow statement and disclosure of all material
events which have occurred in the period covered by the report,' the
institute says in its report.
The institute also recommends a further examination of the effects of
separating the roles of chairman and chief executive.
It says the proposed code of best practice should be made mandatory. It adds
that audit committees and remuneration committees should be mandatory for
all listed companies and other public-interest groups such as the
nationalised industries.
