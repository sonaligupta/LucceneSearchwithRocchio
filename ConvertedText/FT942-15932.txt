FT  13 APR 94 / Race link reported in Bar training


   By ROBERT RICE


Racial discrimination in the selection of trainees at the Bar is a big
disincentive to ethnic minority students and partly responsible for their
high failure rate in its finals course, according to a report published
yesterday, Robert Rice writes.
An inquiry into allegations of racial discrimination at the Bar's law school
found no evidence of direct or indirect discrimination against ethnic
minority students, but said there was 'a significant link' between those who
found traineeships and success in the Bar's final exams.
The inquiry, chaired by Dame Jocelyn Barrow, concluded that discrimination
by barristers' chambers in selecting trainees was partly to blame for the
racial disparity in success and failure rates in the exam.
The inquiry was set up last year by the Bar Council to discover why ethnic
minority students taking the Bar's finals exam in 1992 had a failure rate
nearly three times that of white students.
In the 1991-92 academic year, 44.7 per cent of ethnic minority students
failed the exam, compared with only 16 per cent of white students.
