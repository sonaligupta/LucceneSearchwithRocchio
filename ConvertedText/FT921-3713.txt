   MADRID


Striking steel workers firing a home-made rocket at police in the northern
Basque town of Llodio yesterday. They were protesting at the failure of
negotiations over the future of the Acenor steel works which face closure
with the loss of 1,800 jobs, Reuter reports from Madrid. Workers in the
neighbouring region of Cantabria staged a strike called by the General
Workers' Union, Spain's largest. Police said the protesters set up
barricades of burning tyres in the town of Torrelavega.
Some 2,000 trucks were stranded in La Junquera, on the Spanish-French
border, where French customs officials were on strike yesterday in protest
at plans to abolish their work in the European Community's single market.
