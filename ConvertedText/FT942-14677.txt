FT  19 APR 94 / International Company News: United Technologies rises 66%


   By MARTIN DICKSON


United Technologies, the US technology group, yesterday reported a 66 per
cent increase in first-quarter net income, powered by a sharply improved
performance at Pratt & Whitney, its aero-engine manufacturing subsidiary.
The group reported earnings of Dollars 106m, or 71 cents a share, compared
with Dollars 64m, or 42 cents a share, in the same period last year on
revenues down from Dollars 4.86bn to Dollars 4.84bn.
Pratt's operating income was Dollars 84m, compared with Dollars 24m, and the
underlying improvement was even greater since the 1993 quarter benefited
from a Dollars 75m fee from a company wishing to participate in Pratt's
PW4000 engine programme.
Pratt has been hit hard over the past two years by the downturn in the civil
aviation business, which has cut demand for lucrative spare engine parts.
The company said the improved performance was due to higher commercial
spares sales, lower research and development spending, and continued cost
improvements. This was partly offset by lower shipments of commercial
engines.
Commercial spare parts orders in the first quarter averaged Dollars 140m a
month, compared with a monthly average of Dollars 124m for all of 1993.
The group's flight systems segment had operating income of Dollars 47m, down
from Dollars 71m, as income growth at the Sikorsky helicopter group was more
than offset by results at Hamilton Standard and Norden.
Carrier, the air conditioning unit, had operating income of Dollars 18m, up
from Dollars 8m, as results continued to strengthen in North America,
Asia-Pacific and Carrier Transicold. This was offset partly by European
weakness.
Otis, the elevator group, made Dollars 97m, up Dollars 3m, while automotive
made Dollars 44m, up from Dollars 37m, due primarily to higher production of
American-built cars and trucks and greater penetration in Europe.
