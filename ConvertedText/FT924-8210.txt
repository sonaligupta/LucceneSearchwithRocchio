FT  12 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Vulnerable markets behind slip at Dunhill


   By ANGUS FOSTER


DUNHILL, the luxury goods maker which owns Alfred Dunhill, Montblanc pens
and the Chloe fashion house, yesterday announced a slight fall in profits
owing to lower interest income and recession.
Pre-tax profits were Pounds 30.1m in the six months to September 30. This
compared with Pounds 30.8m last time, when reduced duty-free sales in the
wake of the Gulf war hit profits.
Lord Douro, chairman, said Japan and Germany - two of the company's largest
markets - were both weak.
Turnover increased 21 per cent to Pounds 138.1m, with almost all the growth
due to acquisitions. These included fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld and
stakes in Dunhill's distributors in Japan, the US and Italy.
Operating profits increased 6.5 per cent to Pounds 21.8m.
Sales in Japan fell about 10 per cent while Germany and France, important
markets for Montblanc, looked vulnerable. However, Lagerfeld's recent Paris
shows were successful and boded well for the company's women's wear sales
next year.
Dunhill spent about Pounds 18m on acquisitions during the period and net
cash fell 'about 10 per cent' from the year-end total of Pounds 179.6m.
Lower cash balances and falling interest rates meant interest income fell
from Pounds 10.4m to Pounds 8.3m.
Earnings fell to 11.3p (11.5p); the interim dividend was increased to 2.9p
(2.75p).
The shares fell 9p to 384p.
COMMENT
The 10 per cent decline in Japan, while perhaps not surprising, is still
slightly unnerving, even if some of the shortfall was made up in smaller
markets elsewhere in the Far East. The second half is going to be tough.
Dunhill's hedging policy means there will be no currency gains from
sterling's decline until next year, while profits from the Lagerfeld
acquisition will also be delayed because of long lead times. Dunhill's
ability to manage its worldwide brands is not in doubt, and it has the added
defence of a still substantial cash mountain. But it will be some time
before its image as a high growth stock, achieved in the 1980s, returns.
Forecast profits of Pounds 64m put the shares on a multiple of 16, which
looks fully valued.
