FT  20 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Hammerson


Mr Sydney Mason of Hammerson has a long memory, so his warning that last
year and this will be the worst in his company's history carries weight. But
whereas last year's net asset value suffered a double hit from lower
property values and adverse currency, there is reason to think that exchange
rates will have a positive effect this time. Sterling's weaker trend has
already added back 30p to 40p to net assets. Though the Australian and
Canadian dollars to which Hammerson is particularly exposed may weaken more
again, an asset value of between 800-850p looks possible by the year end.
The main question for investors is whether they want to be in property at
all. This week the sector hit an all-time low relative to the UK market and
is likely to continue to underperform as long as equities generally remain
bright. At least Hammerson has a strong balance sheet. But if it looks
solid, it also looks boring.
