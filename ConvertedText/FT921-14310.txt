FT  16 JAN 92 / Observer: Rag-bag


Wonders of Observer's in-tray, volume 17. Milton Keynes Development
Corporation, due to self-destruct after its twenty-fifth anniversary in
April, has decided to send out one last press-pack.
Here are 10 things you never wanted to know about the UK's fifteenth-biggest
city.
It has:
Europe's largest roller-skating rink. The UK's first purpose-built Japanese
boarding school. More Swedish than French firms. A life-size stegosaurus.
The first peace pagoda in the Western hemisphere. Over 15m new trees and
shrubs. Counting canals and ponds, a coastline longer than that of Jersey.
Central streets planted with plane trees which benefit from heat reflected
off pavements. A mere 15-minute car-drive from one side of the place to the
other. And 20 per cent of its residents unhappy with the way it is planned.
