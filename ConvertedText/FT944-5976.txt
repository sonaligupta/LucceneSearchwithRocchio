FT  01 DEC 94 / Cabinet divided over Euro poll


   By JAMES BLITZ


The government remained divided yesterday over whether to hold a referendum
on Britain's future in Europe, in spite of signs that the prime minister is
willing to back the idea.
As the government prepares for a tough fight with Euro-rebels over the next
stage of European Union integration, Mr John Major is understood to be
considering the offer of a referendum to avoid another damaging dispute in
the Conservative party over Europe.
However, leading members of the cabinet yesterday failed to agree whether to
hold a referendum on the outcome of the EU's inter-governmental conference
(IGC) in 1996.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, who is one of the most pro-European
members of the cabinet, made clear that he viewed the issue as hypothetical.
Asked whether the government should offer a referendum, he told BBC radio:
'We don't know what the agenda at the IGC will be, so it's even less on the
agenda than next year's Budget.'
But Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, added to indications that he
could be shifting his stance towards a referendum, amid fears that the
Labour party might make this pledge at the next general election. At a
session of the Commons foreign affairs committee yesterday, Mr Hurd said:
'We have a sceptical view about referendums. But we have not said 'never'
about 1996 or about a single bank or a single currency.'
In recent days a number of Eurosceptic Tory MPs have indicated that they
backed the government in Monday night's crucial debate over the EU finance
bill following strong hints from ministers that a referendum was likely.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday wrote to the prime
minister seeking clarification on the matter.
