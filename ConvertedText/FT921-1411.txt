FT  24 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Wrong numbers - Ballot Box


Opinion polls can be wrong, as the French have just discovered. The polls
forecast a turnout between 50 per cent and 55 per cent in the regional
elections on Sunday. The actual turn-out was 68.7 per cent, which may have
had a significant influence on the result.
British polls seldom bother with the turnout figure, but it may be worth
watching and even betting on. When Edward Heath and the Tories won a
surprise victory in 1970, it was 72 per cent - the lowest since 1945. When
Labour crept back in the February 1974 election, it was 78.1 per cent - the
highest since 1959.
