FT  19 MAY 92 / Mexico attempts to cut power of teaching union


   By DAMIAN FRASER


   MEXICO CITY


THE Mexican government is to decentralise public education in a move aimed
at curbing the powerful teaching union's effective veto over plans to
modernise the system.
Responsibility for budgets, teacher training, salary negotiations and
regional variations in the national curriculum will be transferred to the 31
state authorities, although the federal government will continue to set
guidelines and provide most resources.
The reforms seek to reduce the power of the National Teachers Union to
obstruct change by, in effect, dividing it into state chapters.
The changes have been accepted by leaders of the union which, with 1m
members, is the largest in Latin America and one of the traditional props of
the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party.
A senior government official said he expected resistance to the changes in
parts of Mexico City, Michoacan, Chiapas and Oaxaca.
Most Mexicans' poor standard of education is explained mainly by rural
poverty and lack of funding. However, poor teacher training, teacher
absenteeism, weak supervision, understaffing of rural schools and lack of
teacher evaluation are widely blamed on the union's unwillingness to impose
greater discipline on teachers.
