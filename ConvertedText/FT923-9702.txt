Christies International is in talks with Sir Anthony Tennant, the out-going
chairman of Guinness, about a position at the international art auctioneers,
although Christie's was not yesterday prepared to confirm that Sir Anthony
is its chosen candidate to succeed Lord Carrington as chairman.
An old Etonian - and art collector with a particular interest in British
works including Scottish contemporary paintings - Sir Anthony combines the
necessary establishment connections with the strongest of commercial
pedigrees. During the past five years he is credited with putting Guinness
back onto its feet after the scandal, and it is assumed that, even with the
Christie's job under his belt, the 61-year-old will be in the market for
another big industrial post after he retires from Guinness at the end this
year.
Lord Carrington has chaired Christie's since 1988, presiding over a very
tough time for the art world. While Christie's now claims a 49 per cent
share of the global market - its highest record since the 1950s - thus
treading heavily on the heels of Sotheby's, it has seen a period of
stringent cost-cutting with Christie's directors taking the lead and voting
themselves 20 per cent pay-cuts this year.
At 73, the former foreign secretary and NATO secretary-general, who, as the
EC's chief negotiator, has been trying to bring peace to the former
Yugoslavia, is likely to step down from Christie's next May at the time of
the annual general meeting.
Promising 'a further statement shortly' a Christie's spokeswoman would only
say the house was 'in discussion with Sir Anthony Tennant with a view to his
joining the board'.
