FT  30 OCT 93 / Malaysia to cut company taxes


   By KIERAN COOKE


   KUALA LUMPUR


MALAYSIA has unveiled a mildly expansionary 1994 budget with substantial
increases in development spending and a cut in corporate tax aimed at
promoting more investment in the country.
Mr Anwar Ibrahim, finance minister, said GDP growth would be more than 8 per
cent this year.
'With this growth, the Malaysian economy would have experienced growth rates
of 8 to 9 per cent for six successive years, an attainment which has never
been achieved before,' said Mr Anwar.
But fast growth had put serious strains on infrastructure. Mr Anwar said
that to overcome infrastructure bottlenecks, developmental expenditure would
be increased by 35 per cent to MDollars 13.35bn (Pounds 3.5bn).
In spite of this increase in spending a rise in government revenues meant
there would be only a marginal budget deficit, said Mr Anwar. The growth of
both domestic and foreign investment in Malaysia has slowed over the past 18
months.
Mr Anwar announced a 2 percentage point cut in corporate tax to 32 per cent
in 1994, with a further reduction to 30 per cent in 1995.
While there were no reductions in income tax, Mr Anwar announced measures to
help lower income groups, including a multi-million dollar plan to build-low
cost urban housing.
