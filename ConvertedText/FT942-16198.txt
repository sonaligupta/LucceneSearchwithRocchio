FT  12 APR 94 / Reform of milk market faces fresh uncertainty


   By ALISON MAITLAND


The dairy sector in England and Wales was plunged into fresh uncertainty
yesterday when the Dairy Trade Federation announced that it had fundamental
objections to the Milk Marketing Board's revised plans for opening the
Pounds 3.3bn milk market to competition.
The federation, which represents dairy processing com-panies, said the
amended proposals were 'unacceptable' and would not create a free market.
Its main objection is to the board's proposed auction system for selling
milk. It said that the system, by which Milk Marque would determine prices
and selling rules, would not provide enough information to buyers.
It proposed instead the creation of a 'milk forum' representing Milk Marque
and prospective buyers under an independent chairmanship.
That forum would set prices, as well as determining how bids would be scaled
back if supply did not match demand.
It would report to the Office of Fair Trading every six months on the
working of the new arrangements if Milk Marque secures 40 per cent or more
of total milk output.
Mr Andrew Dare, the board's chief executive, rejected the proposal and said
it was unlikely to meet EU competition laws or to be accepted by the
government.
'It doesn't open the market up, it's not necessary and it's just an excuse
for buyers to be able to continue buying as a cartel,' he said.
The board has already agreed to an independent arbitrator to ensure that
Milk Marque applies its selling rules fairly.
However, Mr Jim McMichael-Phillips, president of the federation, rejected
that provision as insufficient.
He called for an arbitrator to adjudicate on any disputes in the first two
years of the new market.
