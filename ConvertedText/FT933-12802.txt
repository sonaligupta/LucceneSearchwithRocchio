FT  22 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Zeneca


Zeneca would doubtless prefer to see its shares back above the 600p rights
price before announcing its first results as an independent company. But
even an upbeat message and a solid set of figures next week is unlikely to
give the market more than fleeting encouragement. The 4 per cent fall in the
shares this week - without good reason other than another bout of nerves
about the outlook for the pharmaceuticals sector - underlines that deeper
forces are at work. The company owes Lady Luck at least a vote of thanks for
making sure the downward lurch did not happen during the rights period.
