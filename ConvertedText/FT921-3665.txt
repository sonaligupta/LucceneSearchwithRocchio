FT  13 MAR 92 / Letter: Bank of Italy asserts independence


   From Mr CARLO A CIAMPI


Sir, In the league table of central bank independence accompanying David
Marsh's article ('The road to Emu develops some potholes', Economics
Notebook, March 9), the Bank of Italy is ranked last among those of nine
leading industrial countries.
A meaningful appraisal of central bank independence requires a thorough
evaluation of the institutional setting and of the bank's modus operandi as
developed over time and consolidated in practice.
It would be interesting to know the criteria on which the Financial Times
ranking was compiled.
As far as the Bank of Italy is concerned, its position in the table does not
appear to reflect the autonomy that it has attained, both de jure and de
facto.
Allow me to single out the following points:
The long standing de facto independence of the Bank of Italy in influencing
market interest rates has been recently ratified by a law which has granted
the bank statutory authority to set the official rates on discounts and
advances; it enjoys complete autonomy for the interventions in both domestic
and foreign exchange markets;
There has been no net financing of the Treasury in the last few years, in
spite of the huge deficit and increasing debt of the public sector (see the
letter to the Financial Times from the Italian minister of the Treasury, Mr
Guido Carli, March 6); moreover, there is a bill before parliament providing
for the elimination of direct access to central bank financing by the
Treasury and public authorities.
The members of the directorate of the banks are appointed for an indefinite
term.
