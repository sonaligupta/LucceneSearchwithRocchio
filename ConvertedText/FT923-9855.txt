Dream On (Channel 4 at 10 pm) is a film shot on the riot- ridden Meadow Well
Estate at North Shields, made by a women's collective, Amber Films, from a
script put together by a woman's writing group. It is not as depressing as
it sounds, mixing actresses (one of them Anna-Maria Gascoigne, sister of
Gazza) and localsin a tale of a ladies' darts team.
An hour earlier, on the same channel, Secret History offers much but
delivers little. It aims to shed light on modern political mysteries and
this week examines the death of the Czech foreign minister and democrat Jan
Masaryk, just two weeks after his country was taken over by the Communists
in 1948. Did he fall or was he pushed out of his bedroom window ?.
Images of Marilyn Monroe must be among the most famous of our century. Eve
Arnold, the photo journalist, who frequently captured her during the last 10
years of her life, talks over her contact sheets (BBC 2 at 7.30pm).
After Henry (ITV at 8pm) is a rare comedy programme on a sport-ridden,
evening. It is most notable for the last screen performances of the late
Joan Sanderson.
