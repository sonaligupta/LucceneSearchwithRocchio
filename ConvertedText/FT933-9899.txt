FT  06 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: FT set to launch expanded mines
index


THE Financial Times early this autumn will replace its present gold mines
index, which is based on the performance of South African companies only,
with one enlarged to include Australian and North American gold producers.
Regional indices covering the three geographic areas will also be published.
Companies will be included in the world index if they:
Have sustainable annual gold production of at least 300,000 troy ounces;
Draw at least 75 per cent of revenue from the sale of mined gold;
Have at least 10 per cent of their issued capital available to the investing
public.
These conditions mean that there will be no set number of constituents and
the eligibility of each company will be reviewed four times a year.
The companies expected to be included initially account for about 30m ounces
of annual gold production or 50 per cent of western world output. They
include from Australia: Dominion Mining; Gold Mines of Kalgoorlie; Homestake
Gold Australia; Newcrest; Placer Pacific; Plutonic Resources; and Poseidon
Gold. Canadian companies include: American Barrick Resources; Cambior; Echo
Bay Mines; Hemlo Gold Mines; Lac Minerals; Pegasus Gold; Placer Dome; Royal
Oak Mines; and TVX Gold.
From South Africa there will be: Beatrix; Buffelsfontein; Driefontein;
Elandsrand; Freegold; Harmony; Hartebeestfontein; Kinross; Kloof;
Randfontein; Southvaal; Vaal Reefs; Western Areas; Western Deep Levels; and
Winkelhaak. US mines in the new index will be Battle Mountain Gold;
Homestake Mining; and Newmont Gold.
The method of calculating the index will be a sum of the market
capitalisations of the component companies, denominated in US dollars and
based at 1,000 on December 31 last year, when the gold price was Dollars 333
an ounce. Daily calculations will follow the close of business on the New
York and Toronto stock exchanges.
