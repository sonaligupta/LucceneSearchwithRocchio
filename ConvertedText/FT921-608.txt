FT  28 MAR 92 / Coopers to abandon 'confusing' Deloitte


COOPERS & Lybrand Deloitte, the accountancy firm, is to drop the last word
of its name in June. The move follows confusion among clients caused by the
merger that created the combined firm in 1990. Deloitte Haskins & Sells
merged with Coopers & Lybrand in the UK, but with Touche Ross in most other
countries to become Deloitte Ross Tohmatsu.
The change of name comes after speculation that Coopers & Lybrand would act
to erase signs of its merger with Deloitte. Deloitte Ross Tohmatsu will
become Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu in June. Touche Ross in the UK has no plans
to change its name.
