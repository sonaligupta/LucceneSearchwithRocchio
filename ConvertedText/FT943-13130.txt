FT  21 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Kingfisher concern


   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO


The jitters in the DIY sector - following news earlier this week that US
giant Home Depot is poised to enter the UK market - continued unabated, with
B&Q owner Kingfisher bearing the brunt of investor concern. The company was
yesterday said to be talking up its own trading strategy to institutional
investors and analysts in advance of an imminent announcement over the US
group's European expansion plans.
However, sector specialists said that they did not expect Home Depot's
announcement to contain much detail above their perceived objectives. But
underpinning analysts' concerns over the already overcrowded UK DIY market
is Home Depot's hiring of a former B&Q executive and the possibility of
further defections. Kingfisher shares tumbled 13 to 502p on 2.7m traded.
There were also renewed suggestions of Darty shareholders exercising share
options and making ready to exit Kingfisher in large numbers. Elsewhere,
Texas parent Ladbroke slipped a penny to 167p, while Do It All owners Boots
retreated 3 1/2 to 535 1/2 p and WH Smith 5 to 480p.
