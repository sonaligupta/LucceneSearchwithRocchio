Town Hall (BBC 2, 9.45) is finally picking up the following, and the rave
reviews, it deserves. The attraction of this fly- on-the-wall documentary
about Lewisham Council is that it switches between the arid, devious,
bureaucratic, political meetings of councillors and staff to the realities
of their decisions. This week the subject is the budget for educating
children with special needs, which is badly over-spent. Why it matters comes
to life when you see Christopher, who bites other children and who will cost
Lewisham Pounds 100,000 in care over five years.
There is another gripping documentary on ITV at 9.00. First Tuesday follows
the story of two Siamese twins from Ireland. Their parents have to decide
whether the little girls should be separated. Most surviving Siamese twins
are happy to stay joined, but these two have distinct internal organs and
might survive the operation.
