FT  28 SEP 94 / Generator to test cleaner burning


   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent


A new method of burning coal in large power stations which is expected to
reduce emissions of pollutants is to be installed in Scottish Power's main
coal-burning power station at Longannet on the Firth of Forth.
If the initial installation on one boiler is successful the technology will
be applied to the other three boilers at the 2,400MW plant.
Scottish Power says the technology will reduce emissions of nitrogen oxide
(NOx) by 70 per cent. This will allow more coal to be burned before
emissions limits are reached, extending the market for coal.
The new system of burning coal involves installing gas burners which burn
the coal with gas. It has already been installed on smaller boilers.
The technology has been developed by a consortium including Scottish Power,
Babcock Energy, the Italian electricity utility ENEL, the Italian
engineering company Ansaldo, Electricite de France and the Electricity
Supply Board of the Republic of Ireland.
The initial project will cost Pounds 15.8m and, if successful, the entire
station will be converted to gas burn by 1997.
