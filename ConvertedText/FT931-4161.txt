FT  12 MAR 93 / Ban on Scots rail funding is lifted


   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent


STRATHCLYDE Regional Council, which subsidises the railway network in the
greater Glasgow area, has lifted its ban on a Pounds 52m investment
programme in new trains and tracks.
It imposed the ban when the government announced last month that rail
services in Scotland were to be franchised.
Mr Malcolm Waugh, chairman of the council's transport committee, said he had
received written assurances from Mr Roger Freeman, the transport minister,
that the Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive would be directly
involved in awarding franchise contracts and would be able to specify
service levels and fares on services which the council supports.
The council had suspended the investment programme because of uncertainty
over its future under the franchising arrangements for British Rail.
Strathclyde, like other passenger transport executives, makes decisions
about rail services in its area while BR operates the trains.
Mr Waugh said he had been concerned that rolling stock funded by the council
would be used elsewhere by the franchisee.
He had also been worried that off-peak services would be withdrawn without
reference to the council, which pays the passenger transport executive a
subsidy of Pounds 30m a year.
