Coca-Cola Amatil, an Australian-based distributor for the American soft
drinks giant, plans to open a new distribution centre and a production plant
in Ukraine. The expansion follows similar moves in Slovakia, Hungary and
Belarus to gain market share and challenge Pepsi-Cola in former Communist
countries. The new factory, under a joint-venture project with Kolos
brewery, will produce Coke in Lviv, a western city. The production company,
with an initial Dollars 11.5m in capital, is 57 per cent owned by Coca-Cola
Amatil and the rest by Kolos.
