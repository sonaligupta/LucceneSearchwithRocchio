FT  25 AUG 92 / UK Company News: French eyes on Forte offshoot


   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER


FORTE, the hotels group, said Sodexho, the French catering company, has
expressed an interest in buying Gardner Merchant, its contract catering
subsidiary, writes Michael Skapinker.
The UK group said the French company was one of several which had approached
it to discuss acquiring Gardner Merchant but that negotiations were some way
from completion. Talks aimed at selling Forte's contract catering business
to Compass Group of the UK and ARA Services of the US broke down last month
when the two sides failed to agree on a price.
Mr Rocco Forte, chief executive, said he would like to sell Gardner Merchant
while retaining Forte Airport Services, which provides in-flight catering
for airlines.
He has said he would eventually like to see the airline catering business
floated, with Forte retaining a stake.
