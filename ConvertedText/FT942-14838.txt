FT  19 APR 94 / Japanese investors start to withdraw from US property market

Japanese investors financially restructured, sold or announced sales of a
total Dollars 17.6bn (Pounds 11.95bn) in US property investments last year,
according to Kenneth Leventhal & Company, US accountants, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo. While US banks and life assurers have the real estate
lending problems behind them and expect to post record profits this year,
Japanese institutions, which have only recently started to tackle their
domestic bad property investments and loans, have been slow in dealing with
investments in the US market made in the asset boom of the late 1980s.
The 1993 figure amounts to 23 per cent of the Dollars 77.3bn in US real
estate investments by Japanese investors, including banks, property
companies and construction companies, made in 1985-93.
The New York and Chicago office markets, the New York hotel market and the
Orange County and San Diego industrial markets, which make up a quarter of
Japanese investments, are not expected to recover for three more years.
Another 25 per cent is in the Los Angeles office and Hawaii hotel markets,
where recovery is not expected for at least five years.
Japanese institutions have traditionally taken the 'hold and wait' strategy
in dealing with problem US real estate assets in the hope that US property
markets will would recover.
Of the Dollars 17.59bn liquidated or restructured last year, 45 per cent has
been in hotels and resorts.
