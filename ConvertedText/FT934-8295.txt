FT  16 NOV 93 / International Company News: Barlow Rand posts 15% decline
before unbundling

IN its last report before unbundling, Barlow Rand, South Africa's largest
industrial group, yesterday announced a 15 per cent decline in earnings per
share to 367 cents in the year to September, from 432 cents last year.
While the results need to be seen against the background of a domestic
economy in recession for four years, they provide further evidence of why
the group has decided to restructure.
Since 1989, when earnings peaked at 544 cents per share, they have declined
steadily to their current level, 48 per cent lower. The 1993 dividend was
maintained at 173 cents per share, virtually unchanged from 170 cents in
1989.
Turnover rose only 7 per cent in 1993 - the lowest increase in a decade - to
R38bn (Dollars 11.3bn) from R35.4bn. Although costs were well controlled,
margins were under pressure and operating profit, before interest, fell 9
per cent to R2.5bn from R2.7bn. After-tax profit fell 7 per cent to R1.6bn
from R1.7bn, but the higher portion of earnings due to minorities caused
attributable income to fall 14 per cent to R721m, from R839m.
Mr Warren Clewlow, chairman, said the recession had affected virtually all
markets in which the group operates, with coal group Randcoal, and
Finazauto, the Spanish caterpillar dealership, worst hit.
Of the two companies now split from Barlows, Reunert (electronics) and CG
Smith (food, packaging and pharmaceuticals and textiles), Reunert did well
to increase attributable earnings by 17 per cent to R108m, while CG Smith
increased earnings by 7 per cent to R443m.
Mr Clewlow said three factors had caused the R18m loss at Finazauto, the
main drag on results: very poor trading conditions, restructuring, and high
finance charges. Predicting an improvement, he said trading was unlikely to
get worse, the restructuring had been completed, and the reorganisation of
J. Bibby, the parent company, which should raise R80m to R90m, would remove,
or considerably reduce, Finazauto's debt.
Looking at the 1993 earnings in terms of the new structure, of the 364 cents
(slightly lower than the actual figure because of an accounting adjustment)
per share earnings, 120 cents would have been attributable to CG Smith, 57
cents to Reunert, 28 cents to Rand Mines, 8 cents to Rand Mines properties,
and the balance, of 151 cents, to the 'new' Barlows.
Turnover at the new Barlows would have been R12.3bn, compared to R11.2bn,
and attributable earnings R297m, against R396m.
Mr Clewlow said he believed group earnings were sustainable, and predicted
'real growth' in the coming year. The group's longer term future is closely
tied to the country's levels of infrastructure spending, currently at an
unprecedented low. Mr Clewlow said: 'A new government has got to look at
infrastructure spending, otherwise it won't be here next time round.'
