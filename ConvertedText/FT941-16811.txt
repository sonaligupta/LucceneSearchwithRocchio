Total investment could reach Dollars 120m during subsequent phases of the
venture, it said.
GM will hold a 51 per cent stake in the venture. Wan Yuan will have 39 per

Wan Yuan is a subsidiary of the China Aerospace, responsible for developing,
manufacturing and testing launch vehicles for space satellites. Beijing
Economic Technology Investment Development is controlled by the Beijing

At a preview of the North American International Auto show, Mr J. T.

automotive components group, said the venture would 'foster China's emerging
vehicle market'.
He said Chinese engineers and technicians would be trained to calibrate
engines in the US, Europe and elsewhere.
