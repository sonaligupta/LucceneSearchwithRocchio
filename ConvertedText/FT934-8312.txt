FT  16 NOV 93 / International Company News: Two Glaxo drugs to face Astra
challenge


   By PAUL ABRAHAMS


ASTRA, the Swedish pharmaceuticals group, is in the final stages of
developing treatments to compete with two of Glaxo's top-selling drugs.
The company said it planned to submit its first dossier for its Turbuhaler
device containing a generic version of Glaxo's Ventolin, the world's
best-selling asthma treatment, by the end of the year.
It claimed the Turbuhaler was far more effective at delivering the drug into
the lungs than traditional inhalers. Ventolin generated sales for Glaxo last
year of Pounds 484m (Dollars 731m).
Astra did not say when it would submit a dossier to the Food and Drug
Administration in the US, the world's largest market. It is also planning to
submit dossiers for Turbuhaler generic versions of Boehringer Ingelheim's
Attovent, and Ciba's Foradil, a product licensed from Yamanouchi.
Glaxo said the Turbuhaler's ability to increase drug volumes reaching the
lungs was immaterial because the medicine's concentration could easily be
increased to compensate without risk of side-effects.
The company already markets its own dry-powder disk inhaler and is
developing additional asthma delivery systems. It admitted Ventolin, known
as Volmax in North America, had not had any generic inhaled competition so
far in the US.
The Swedish group also said that in 1995 it would submit the first dossier
for the eradication of helicobacter pylori, a bacterium that causes peptic
ulcers, using its anti-ulcer drug Losec and an antibiotic, amoxycillin.
A large proportion of Glaxo's sales of Zantac, the world's best-selling
drug, are to prevent the recurrence of ulcers. If the combination is
effective and adopted by doctors it could have an adverse impact on Zantac
sales, which represent 44 per cent of Glaxo group turnover.
Glaxo is developing its own eradication therapy using Zantac.
