FT  15 JUN 93 / Union challenge to pay ceiling


THE government's 1.5 per cent public-sector pay limit faced its first big
challenge yesterday after it was rejected by leaders of 500,000 white-collar
local government workers.
Their decision was fuelled by fears of the ceiling being extended to next
year.
Delegates at the Brighton conference of Nalgo, the public service union,
called on the union to campaign against the pay ceiling and threatened a
strike ballot over the issue. They overturned a recommendation from their
leaders who had 'reluctantly' asked for the ceiling to be accepted.
The 1.5 per cent offer will be put to a ballot, with a second ballot on
industrial action threatened if workers vote to reject the offer.
