The Treuhand privatisation agency hopes to sell Eko Stahl, eastern Germany's
loss-making steel mill, by the end of August to one of the five potential
buyers that have shown interest since Riva, the Italian steel maker, pulled
out of a deal two months ago. Mr Hans Kramer, a Treuhand board member, told
employees at Eko Stahl, in the state of Brandenburg, that the agency would
today approve a financing and investment package for the steel mill to see
it through the second part of this year. The Treuhand has lined up five
potential buyers. These include Cockerill Sambre, the Belgian-based steel
producer, the Hegemann Group which is based in Bremen, a Hamburg consortium,
and companies from Russia and Kazakhstan.
