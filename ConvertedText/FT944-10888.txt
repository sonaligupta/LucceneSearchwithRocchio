FT  09 NOV 94 / UN tribunal seeks extradition


   By RONALD VAN DE KROL


   AMSTERDAM


The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal yesterday ended its first public sitting by
making a formal request to Germany for the extradition of an alleged Bosnian
Serb war criminal being held in Munich. Germany has already said it is
willing to hand over Mr Dusan Tadic to the United Nations tribunal, but it
must first amend its laws to allow extradition to an international body. Mr
Tadic, who was arrested on a visit to Germany in February, has denied that
he was responsible for the killing of three Moslem prisoners in Serb-held
Bosnia. If extradited, Mr Tadic is likely to stand trial early next year in
what would be the first international war crimes trial to take place since
the Nuremberg and Tokyo trials began in 1945.
The case against Mr Tadic underlines the tribunal's dependence on the
co-operation of national governments and its inability to apprehend war
criminals while fighting continues in the territory of former Yugoslavia. On
Monday night, the tribunal's prosecutor issued an arrest warrant for Mr
Dragan Nikolic, commander of the Susica camp in the Bosnian city of
Vlasenica, on charges of murder, torture and mutilation of Moslem prisoners.
However, Mr Nikolic is believed to be in a Serb-held part of Bosnia, and
chances of his arrest and extradition are considered to be slight.
