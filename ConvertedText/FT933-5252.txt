FT  04 SEP 93 / Unitary authority plans delayed


THE FINAL report by the Local Government Commission on its proposals for
reorganising Derbyshire County Council has been postponed for seven weeks,
the Department of the Environment said yesterday.
Its provisional recommendation to create two unitary authorities, one for
Derby and the other covering the remainder of the county, was strongly
criticised by local MPs and employers when it was announced in May. The
commission's final decision, following formal responses from the local
community, will not now be published until November 7. It was scheduled to
be released on September 19, just before the Conservative party conference.
Decisions on reorganisation for Durham and Cleveland have been brought
forward by two weeks, and will now also be announced on November 7.
