FT  18 APR 94 / Markets: Zulus and platinum prices - Global Investor


   By MARTIN DICKSON


   NEW YORK


Fresh outbreaks of political violence seem likely in South Africa over the
next few days, ahead of next week's first all-race elections. Zulus
demanding tribal autonomy are promising mass protests in the streets of
Johannesburg from today. The last time they did so 53 people died.
Such a turbulent political backdrop might appear to spell sharply higher
precious metal prices. Yet as tension has mounted in South Africa over the
past few weeks, and attempts to negotiate a settlement with the Zulus have
failed, the prices of gold and platinum have been notably subdued.
Both enjoyed a brief run-up in early April but since then have fallen back,
and expectations of a sustained surge over the coming weeks are probably
misplaced, provided that Mr Nelson Mandela, the republic's leader in
waiting, remains in good health.
South Africa now produces only 20 per cent of the world's gold, thanks to
sharply rising output in Australia and the US, and newly mined gold only
adds a small fraction to the world's supply of the metal, which is largely
stockpiled. Temporarily South African supply problems need not, therefore,
have a dramatic effect on prices.
South Africa's gold mines, moreover, which are nowhere near the worst
political trouble spots in Natal province, are insulated by security
cordons, and Zulus account for a very small percentage of their workforce.
So any large disruption of supply is unlikely.
Platinum is a little different. South Africa produces 75 per cent of world
supplies and the Soviet Union accounts for the bulk of the remainder. Most
of the platinum mined each year is consumed immediately by industrial users,
notably vehicle manufacturers for catalytic converters.
Its price is therefore closely tied to potential South African supply and
the economic cycle, particularly in Japan, which accounts for about 55 per
cent of global demand.
Mr Andy Smith at UBS in London considers that more than 70 per cent of
changes in the spread between platinum and gold since 1986 can be explained
by the discount of the financial Rand to the commercial Rand (a proxy for
South African 'supply shock') and by movements in the Nikkei stock index (a
proxy for Japanese demand).
The sharp rise in platinum prices early this year may have been due partly
to precautionary Japanese buying, but much of it seems to have been driven
by commodity funds speculating in the futures markets.
The drop in the platinum price over the past few weeks seems due in no small
measure to commodity funds liquidating their holdings ahead of the election,
and there seem to be few fundamental reasons for a rapid rise.
The re-intregration of the Bophuthatswana homeland, a leading source of
platinum, into South Africa in February removed the main risk to the
Republic's supply. South African production of the metal is expanding, and
so is recycling.
However while there may not be much sustained upward pressure on platinum
prices over the next few months, 1995 and 1996 could be a different matter.
By then, the Japanese economy should be well on the mend, and the honeymoon
of South Africa's new multi-racial government could well be fading.
US technology stocks
This week could be a very bumpy one for US technology stocks as a raft of
the sector's leading companies produce first quarter figures, including
Intel and Microsoft (today) and IBM (Thursday).
Technology stocks have been among the US market's strongest performers
recently but the sector has been in a nervous state since a sharp drop in
prices across the board last week, when Wall Street took fright at what
appeared to be a series of relatively innocuous events.
The primary catalyst was first quarter earnings from Motorola, which were 46
per cent up on last year, but 1 cent per share shy of Wall Street's mean
expectation. The stock fell 10 per cent in two days, even though Motorola is
one of the strongest companies in the sector. It has a broadly diversified
product line and dominates the wireless communications market, which is set
for explosive growth, both in the US and internationally.
The anxiety over Motorola was compounded by the semi-conductor industry's
report of a book to bill ratio (orders to product shipped) of 1.13 for
March, which was healthy and unchanged from February. However it was below
Wall Street expectations, which ranged as high as 1.2. On Friday Digital
Equipment saw 20 per cent knocked off its share price when it reported
losses which were much heavier than expected.
Digital, struggling to adapt belatedly to a shift in demand from large
systems to personal computers, is something of a special case, and there is
no obvious explanation for the market's general disenchantment with
technology.
As much as anything, it seems to be due to the puncturing of excessively
high expectations and fear that US industry's sharply increased spending on
high technology capital equipment could start to reach a plateau.
Motorola, for example, seems to have been punished partly because it has
established a tradition of consistently beating the market's earnings
forecasts. Merely matching them is a disappointment, and that could spell
trouble for other companies reporting less than stellar figures this week.
Corn and beans
The television news pictures have a depressing familiarity from last year.
Heavy rains have again brought flooding to parts of the agricultural
mid-west, reviving memories of last year's Mississippi floods, which sent
the price of agricultural commodities sharply higher. So far, however, the
deluge has had little effect on the price of corn and soybeans, the two
crops most affected by the floods of 1993.
This is partly because planting has yet to start, but also because
meteorologists are predicting that 1994 will not see a repetition of last
year's severe flooding. The outbreaks so far are isolated and the
forecasters are predicting normal precipitation over the next month.
Corn prices, which have risen more than 20 per cent since the start of 1993,
and soybeans, up 13 per cent, look like remaining robust for the next few
months. However if the meteorologists are correct they could come under
substantial downward pressure as harvest time approaches.
That is because farmers are planning to plant nearly 140m acres of the crops
this year, the highest in almost a decade, and the Federal government has
put a one year hold on its programme under which farmers have to idle land
to qualify for crop subsidies. It is anxious to rebuild grain stocks which
have fallen to their lowest level since the 1970s because of last year's
flooding.
Better harvests around the world mean that US exports of oilseeds, feed
grains and wheat could be down 15 per cent this year, which should also put
downward pressure on prices.
All this, of course, assumes the heavens do not stay open. But statistics
are on the farmers' side. In the past century the mid-west has never had two
torrential springs running.
South Korea
The South Korean Government, which sold an initial 10 per cent of
state-owned Korea Telecom to domestic buyers last autumn, is due to auction
another 5 per cent today and tomorrow under a plan to reduce its holding to
51 per cent by 1996.
Despite a strong supply of new offerings in the Seoul market, the issue is
expected to sell well, given the company's commanding position in the sector
and the very positive outlook for the Korean economy.
At a time when most emerging markets have been badly caught in the backwash
of rising US interest rates, the Korean Composite stock market index is up
nearly 3 per cent on the year and appears to be in the middle of a solid
bull run, helped by sharply rising earnings and plentiful liquidity.
North Korean nuclear threats are a wild card, but could prove the blustering
forerunner of reduced political tensions on the peninsula.
The problem for foreign investors is getting enough of the market, given
Government restrictions on overseas stock ownership. However there are signs
Seoul could ease controls in the second half of the year.
