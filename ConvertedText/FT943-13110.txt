FT  21 JUL 94 / Danes move over shipyard aid


   By HILARY BARNES

The Association of Danish Shipbuilders yesterday sent a writ against the
European Commission to the European Court in Luxembourg alleging that the
Commission exceeded the terms of an EU directive when it approved German
subsidies to shipyards in the former East Germany. The association took
action when the Danish government itself decided last Friday not to bring a
case. As the writ, challenging a Commission decision of May 11 this year,
had to be lodged by midnight last night, the association's writ was sent by
courier. The EU's 7th shipbuilding directive approved German subsidies to
the eastern shipyards for a total of DM3.2bn (Pounds 1.32bn), but only on
certain conditions: the capacity of the yards had to be reduced and
operating subsidies were not to exceed 36 per cent of 'normal turnover'. The
association claims that the capacity of the yards will in fact be expanded
very substantially and that the operating subsidies to the MTW shipyard at
Wismar, owned by the Bremer Vulkan group, will be 70 per cent of turnover.
