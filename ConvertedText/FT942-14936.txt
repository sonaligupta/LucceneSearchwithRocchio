FT  18 APR 94 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo


   By EMIKO TERAZONO


The Japanese bond market is expected to be supported by activity from
domestic institutional investors, which concluded their annual asset
allocation meetings last week.
The recent rise in bond yields have made returns on the stock market seem
low. Mr Toshiomu Uragami, chairman of the Life Insurance Association, last
week revealed that most life assurers will maintain a cautious stance toward
stock investment and will increase allocations to the domestic bond market.
Investors are likely to focus on February household spending data to be
announced in the latter half of the week as the figures are likely to
confirm the recent trend of growing consumer spending.
Meanwhile, political wrangling over the shape of the next government has had
little impact on bond prices, since most investors reckon that whoever
becomes the next prime minister after Mr Morihiro Hosokawa is unlikely to
change overall economic policy drastically.
Mr Mikio Fujii of Nomura Securities, says if Mr Michio Watanabe, former
foreign minister, is chosen, the bond market may briefly fall since he is
seen as a fiscal expansionist, but if Mr Tsutomu Hata is elected, the market
may be in for a short rally since he was finance minister when the stock
market plunged to a six-year low in 1992.
