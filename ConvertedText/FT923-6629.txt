FT  22 AUG 92 / Briefcase, Q&A: Selling a business


I HAVE been in business as a sole trader for the last 10 years. I am 65 and
propose selling the business to two colleagues.
It is a service business and the only asset is the goodwill, which has been
evaluated at Pounds 200,000. Unfortunately the two colleagues do not have
Pounds 100,000 each readily available to make the purchase.
Are there any provisions in capital gains legislation or related case law
which allows a would-be purchaser of a business to repay the purchase price
over a period of time out of profits generated from the business without
affecting the seller's CGT requirement relief.
Yes, there is no problem (so far as CGT is concerned) if the sale agreement
provides for the consideration to be paid by instalments over a number of
years.
The solicitor who draws up the sale agreement will be able to guide you
through the tax maze. Ask your tax office for the free pamphlet CGT6 -
Retirement: disposal of a business.
No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the
answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as
soon as possible.
