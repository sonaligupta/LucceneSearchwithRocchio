FT  29 JAN 92 / International Company News: GM issues Dollars 750m
preference stock


   By MARTIN DICKSON


GENERAL MOTORS, the US automobile group suffering severe losses because of
recession, is taking a further step to strengthen its balance sheet by
issuing Dollars 750m in a new preference stock. This is its third equity
offering in seven months.
The company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to offer a
new class of preference stock convertible into the company's class E common
stock.
Dividends of the E stock are based on the performance of Electronic Data
Systems, the profitable information technology business that General Motors
acquired in the mid-1980s.
The share issue means that GM is using the success at Electronic Data
Systems to bolster the poor performance of its North American automobile
operations, which are estimated to have lost more than Dollars 6bn in 1991,
leading to a group loss of about Dollars 3bn.
Some 12m depositary shares of Dollars 50 will be issued in the US and a
further 3m internationally, while the underwriters will have an option to
buy a further 2.25m.
The issue forms part of a rush to issue new stock by corporate America,
which is trying to reduce the leverage of its balance sheet and take
advantage of the rise on the stock market and low interest rates.
