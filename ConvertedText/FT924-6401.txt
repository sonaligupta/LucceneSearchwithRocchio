FT  21 NOV 92 / Fresh BCCI charges for Virani


   By JOHN MASON


MR Nazmu Virani, the former chairman of Control Securities, was charged
yesterday with 14 fresh offences by police investigating the collapse of
Bank of Credit and Commerce International, John Mason writes.
A warrant was also issued for the arrest of Mr Mohammed Moizul Haque, a
former member of the central credit division of BCCI London and the bank's
property investment department. Mr Haque is believed to be in Pakistan,
which has no extradition treaty with the UK.
Mr Virani was charged on one count of conspiring with Mr Haque to defraud
depositors. The two men face 12 joint charges of false accounting. Mr Virani
was also charged with the theft of Pounds 674,998.94 from Zelva Anstalt, a
Liechtenstein company.
The single original charge against Mr Virani of conspiracy to account
falsely was dropped.
Alleged bogus loans and debts covered by the charges total more than Pounds
27m.
