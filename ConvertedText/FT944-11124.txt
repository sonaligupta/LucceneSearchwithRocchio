FT  08 NOV 94 / Bumpy ride for balloon company


   By JIM KELLY


Airbourne Group, the company which made the hot air balloons that hold the
records for the highest and furthest journeys, has come down to earth with a
bump, Jim Kelly writes. It has gone into receivership after spending Pounds
2.5m on airship development.
But Touche Ross, the receiver, is confident that it can fly again. At least
six potential buyers have contacted Touche Ross and there are 'stacks of
orders' for its core products - hot air balloons, barrage balloons and
thermal defence targets.
Airbourne, and its trading companies which include Airborne Industries and
Thunder and Colt, is responsible for 30 per cent of the world's hot air
balloon market.
Mr Andrew Peters, joint administrator, said the group had an annual turnover
of Pounds 10m and there was a good chance of a sale as a going concern.
Development into airships had caused the problems, he said. The craft, used
mostly for advertising, had not found a market.
The company's plants are in Southend and Oswestry and employ about 130
people.
Airbourne balloons hold the world altitude record at 64,997 feet and the
world distance record at 7,672 kilometres. Both were set in 1988.
