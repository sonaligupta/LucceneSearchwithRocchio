FT  05 NOV 93 / Russia may not secure fresh aid this year


   By JOHN LLOYD

RUSSIA is unlikely to receive further funding from the international
financial institutions or the Group of Seven industrial countries this year,
according to senior G7 officials.
This is in spite of strong pressure from Mr Boris Fyodorov, the finance
minister.
Introducing a new package of austerity measures yesterday, he said the
second, Dollars 1.5bn tranche of the systemic transformation facility from
the International Monetary Fund should be paid by the end of the year  - a
much-needed sign of confidence in the reform process.
However, foreign observers say inflation, at between 21-24 per cent in
September alone, is not yet on a firmly declining trend, while the budget
deficit will reach at least 10 per cent of gross national product this year
in spite of efforts to trim it.
The provisional budget deficit for the fourth quarter  - set at Rbs5,200bn -
is seen as unachievable because it would invole cuts to agricultural credits
and other programmes which cannot be reduced without grave damage to the
country's economy.
This means the IMF's second tranche is unlikely to be seriously considered
until early next year, by which time a new government will be in place as a
result of elections on December 12.
The government has been working to an economic plan which was agreed with
the IMF for the final three months of the year, but has met few of the
targets for inflation, budget deficit or credit flows. Hostility between Mr
Fyodorov and Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman, remains
strong, hindering efforts to achieve an agreed level of credits and to
co-ordinate the fight against inflation. Russia is pressing for a meeting
with G7 finance and foreign ministers in Moscow in either December or
January, to review the progress of reforms.
