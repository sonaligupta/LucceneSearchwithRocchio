FT  21 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets: Ericsson, Nokia hit new highs


Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications group, saw its B shares rise SKr8
to SKr435 after an intraday, 1994 high of SKr442.50, with buying interest
boosted by strong interim results from Nokia, the mobile telephone based
Finnish conglomerate.
Earlier this month, Ericsson B registered a four-day gain of 8.2 per cent,
to SKr422, in response to a strong interim report from Motorola, of the US.
Late on Wednesday, Nokia, Europe's biggest manufacturer of mobile
telephones, reported eight-month pre-tax profits up from FM466m to FM2.29bn,
well above a consensus analysts' forecast of FM1.72bn. 'Expectations are
high for Ericsson now,' said a dealer.
Ericsson is due to present its nine-month results on November 17.
Yesterday's gain helped Sweden's Affarsvarlden General index to move forward
6.30 to 1,463.90.
Both Ericsson and Nokia, quoted in New York, had climbed overnight on US
investors' enthusiasm for the stocks. In Finland yesterday, Nokia hit its
1994 peak, ending FM39 up at FM678 after an intraday high of FM692.
But corporate news in Finland was mixed, and the Helsinki market reflected
this. Shares in the banking group Kansallis-Osake-Pankki (KOP) fell FM1.95
to a new 1994 low of FM8.65 after it announced plans to raise FM2bn in a
complicated equity capital exercise; the market's Hex index fell 6.6 to
1,950.9.
