FT  29 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Vital for London's future


   From Mr STEPHEN O'BRIEN and Others


Sir, During the House of Commons debate on April 21, the secretary of state
for transport reiterated the government's support for the CrossRail project.
Such a welcome and positive restatement of commitment from government - as
the select committee moves towards a decision on the future of the CrossRail
project - signifies just how fundamental this scheme is to the future of
London.
CrossRail is crucial to London's image as a world-class city. Its
cancellation or postponement would be a severe setback to achieving a modern
and integrated transport network for the capital.
Not only would such a delay cause planning blight to swathes of property
across London on a scale not experienced since the Planning Act came into
force, but the resulting uncertainty - which seems to dog all new transport
projects - would also dampen the private sector's appetite for investment.
We urge most strenuously that the CrossRail Bill is taken to a prompt and
positive conclusion. London cannot afford blight on the scale implicit in a
deferred decision. The select committee must seize this opportunity to bring
into being a vital component of London's transport system and to help bring
about a transport network fit for the 21st century.
