FT  12 MAR 92 / International Company News: News Corp seeks alliances


   By ALAN FRIEDMAN


MR Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation is negotiating with consumer electronic
and computer companies to form alliances under which News Corp would supply
electronic data for distribution to individual and company customers, writes
Alan Friedman.
To launch the business area, Mr Murdoch was forming a division to be called
News Electronic Data (NED) with Mr John Evans, former head of the Murdoch
magazines division, as president.
Mr Evans said the new business would have non-exclusive access to the
world-wide data bases of News Corp and would provide personal computer
owners with the data in digital format, by way of telephone modem links.
