FT  19 APR 91 / World Trade News: Senators urge US retaliation on patents


A GROUP of 25 US senators yesterday urged the Bush administration to
retaliate against four countries 'that tolerate the most egregious piracy'
of patents and copyrights: Thailand, China, India and Indonesia.
Under the so-called 'Special 301' provision of the 1988 trade law, Mrs Carla
Hills, the US trade representative, must name by April 30 those which fail
to protect intellectual property rights for books, films, music and computer
software. Mrs Hills is required to seek talks with those countries, and if
they fail, she can impose trade sanctions.
Indonesia is still in engaged in talks to avoid action, but negotiations
with the other three have broken off.
The senators also demanded action against Mexico, unless it implements
commitments to improve intellectual property protection, and it requested
talks with the EC for its quotas on TV programmes.
In the past two years, Mrs Hills avoided designating any countries on the
Special 301 list; instead she published a two-tiered 'watch list' which did
not require any retaliation.
Mr Jack Valenti, chairman of the Motion Picture Export Association, said the
US must not approve any Uruguay Round agreement that leaves the EC TV quotas
intact.
