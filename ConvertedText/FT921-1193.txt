FT  25 MAR 92 / UN seeks written Libyan pledge


   By MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS


MR Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, yesterday gave Libya 24
hours to supply a written commitment to surrender the alleged Lockerbie
bombers to Britain or the US, his spokesman said yesterday.
The request was put to Dr Ali Elhouderi, Libyan ambassador to the UN, who,
according to the spokesman, had informed Mr Ghali of 'his government's
willingness to hand over the accused persons'.
In response, the UN chief sought written confirmation that handing the men
over to the Arab League 'would be a first step in complying fully and
unconditionally' with Security Council Resolution 731. This called for their
surrender to British or US authorities seeking their extradition.
An Arab League delegation, led by its secretary-general Mr Esmat
Abdel-Maguid, flew to Tripoli yesterday to discuss with Libya the proposed
handover to the 21-nation league.
Libya made the offer after Arab League foreign ministers had offered only
limited support for Libya in its confrontation with Britain, the US and
France over its alleged role in the bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie,
in Scotland, in 1988 and a UTA jet over Niger in 1989.
However, details of any handover were unclear yesterday and earlier optimism
at the United Nations gave way to a suspicion that, as one senior official
put it, 'we're getting a runaround'.
Sir David Hannay, British ambassador to the UN, said last night there was a
high degree of uncertainty on the issue. 'The jury's out as far as I'm
concerned,' he said. If there was no positive outcome, then 'we will want to
move ahead rather quickly' on action in the Security Council. If outcome was
negative, 'I don't think there will much further delay' on sanctions.
