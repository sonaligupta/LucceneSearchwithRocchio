FT  22 OCT 94 / First contract for Swans' rescuer


   By CHRIS TIGHE


The company which has agreed to buy the Hebburn yard of Swan Hunter, the
Tyneside shipbuilder in receivership, has won its first ship repair contract
for the site before the purchase deal has been legally completed.
On Thursday, the day the Hebburn yard's sale to Tees Dockyard is due to be
completed, the Stena Well Servicer, an offshore oil and gas field support
vessel, will arrive for overhaul and refurbishment.
The Hebburn site's buyers - who clinched their purchase agreement 10 days
ago with receivers Price Waterhouse - have started interviewing ex-Swan
Hunter employees and jobless Tyneside ship repair workers.
They need to recruit 100 temporary workers for the three-week Stena
contract, but those taken on have the prospect of becoming part of the new
permanent core workforce at Hebburn, expected to reach 200 within a year.
Yesterday Mr Eric Welsh, managing director of Tees Dockyard and chief
executive of its new Hebburn business, Tyne Tees Dockyard, said the speed
with which the first contract had been won had raised eyebrows. 'It's come
so fast,' said Mr Welsh. 'Everybody on the Tyne is delighted.'
The six-figure contract was won in competition against a Rotterdam ship
repairer. Mr Welsh was particularly pleased to get a vessel into Hebburn on
the first day of ownership. 'It will start paying for itself straight away.'
Other contracts for Hebburn are under negotiation including serious
inquiries from Norwegian shipping fleets. 'I would guess the next two to
three contracts will employ over 200,' he said.
