FT  06 NOV 93 / Top accountant may face censure


   By ANDREW JACK


THE DISCIPLINARY commit-tee of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in
England and Wales is expected next week to find against a former head of its
own investigations committee.
Mr Brian Worth was under scrutiny for the adequacy of his supervision while
chairman of Kenneth Leventhal (CKL), an international association of
accountancy firms including Clark Whitehill in the UK.
The institute launched an examination of his 'supervisory responsibilities'
regarding Mr Nick Young, a former executive director of CKL who was
convicted for forgery and deception at the Old Bailey three years ago and
has since been released from jail.
Mr Young, who was not an accountant, used CKL's address and its stationery
as part of a scheme which attracted more than Pounds 7m from more than 70
investors over 10 years.
While claiming to invest money in offshore trusts offering high rates of
return, Mr Young was actually spending it on a system of horserace betting
which he believed he had perfected while attending Cambridge University in
the 1960s.
More than 60 investors who subscribed to Mr Young's schemes are pursuing CKL
and Clark Whitehill for compensation, alleging that the firm should have
been aware of his activities.
Mr Worth, who lives in Gloucestershire, was in charge of the institute's
investigations committee and resigned in late 1991 when it began examining
the case.
He denied failing in his supervisory responsibilities, and had stressed that
he had accepted Mr Young's assurances on a number of issues related to his
activities.
Earlier this year he said that the CKL committee was spread around the world
and that Mr Young was the association's only employee in the UK. He said
that he had met Mr Young only once or twice each month.
Following hearings last week, the case has been adjourned until next
Thursday when a formal decision is expected.
