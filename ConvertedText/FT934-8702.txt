FT  13 NOV 93 / Property: The enduring joys of Gloucestershire - Gerald
Cadogan explores a county with Roman roots


   By GERALD CADOGAN


SHEEP have shaped Gloucestershire. Without them, it would not be the the
attraction it is (despite the horsey exploits in Jilly Cooper's novels). For
one thing, they have paid for the county's desirable residences, which the
Romans were the first to build.
The National Trust's Roman villa at Chedworth shows how a working estate
processed the wool. The reception rooms were heated to a standard not
achieved again until this century, and were floored with mosaics. The
Cotswold demand was enough to support a school of mosaic-makers in Corinium
(Cirencester). A favourite subject for this Roman equivalent of the Wilton
carpet factory was the Greek hero, Orpheus, charming the animals.
In the Middle Ages, the wool financed great churches like Fairford and
Cirencester; the manors, rectories and farmhouses that are popular places to
live; the stately homes; and the old market towns. The weekend retreats of
Eurobond dealers in 1993 began as shepherds' cottages.
As buyers stream to Gloucestershire, it is hard to envisage the county as
the depressed backwater it was between the first and second world wars.
Employment was scarce in the villages.
Motorways have helped to change that, though. Tucked into the north-eastern
angle of the M4/M5 crossing, and bisected by the Romans' Fosse Way that
leads cross-country to Leicester, the county is accessible to the whole
country.
Outdoor pleasures await. Even for hopeless shots, it is a joy to meet in a
farmyard at 10 on a crisp winter morning for a day of tramping the hills in
a rough shoot for pheasants. And gardeners can choose their Mecca, too. In
the north of the county, near the picturesque (and touristic) Chipping
Campden, the shrines of Hidcote and Kiftsgate sit as twins on either side of
the road. Hidcote is on the high ground, Kiftsgate terraced into the scarp
where the Cotswolds drop down into the Severn valley.
Demand is keen now for top-of-the-range houses, and prices often are higher
than in counties to east and west. Some houses sell before they are ever on
the market formally, such as the grade I Daneway House near Cirencester -
medieval, with arts and crafts associations from the turn of the century -
which Knight Frank & Rutley sold recently at more than the guide price of
Pounds 700,000. The agent told 12 likely buyers - and three bid.
The middle price range has been moving more slowly in recent months,
according to Antony Brassey, of Lane Fox in Cirencester. One on his books
(with Strutt & Parker) is Rivermead House, on the edge of Lechlade, for
Pounds 345,000. (The river is the Thames which rises nearby).
For the same price, Jackson-Stops is selling Fennells Home Farm at Lypiatt,
near Stroud, with five acres and an annexe for help or granny. The house is
a good example of Gloucestershire vernacular: roofed steeply, with
warm-coloured stone walls broken by mullioned windows.
Leasehold flats in Sherborne House, an early-19th century pile near
Cheltenham which was converted in 1982, could not be more different. Lane
Fox offers one for Pounds 125,000 and (with Hamptons) another for Pounds
145,000. The leases have 988 years left at a ground rent of Pounds 20 a
year.
Cottages and village houses are on offer from Hayman- Joyce, Hurley Lloyd
Thorpe and Mallams. Two smart, late-Georgian boxes are the Old School House
at Aldsworth, near Bibury (Mallams, Pounds 155,000), and Malvern House in
Blockley (Hayman-Joyce, Pounds 245,000).
Two interesting town houses are Church House at Moreton-in-Marsh
(Hayman-Joyce, Pounds 185,000), well placed for the Tuesday market and
eating at the Marsh Goose as well as for being devout next door; and the Old
School in Cirencester (Lane Fox, Pounds 355,000), listed grade II with a
large panelled drawing room which was the school room. The house goes back
to late medieval times.
Kingsmead House at Didmarton, with three cottages, a stable yard and 10
acres, is ideal for those who want to hunt with the Beaufort and be close to
the horse trials at Badminton. But there is also a good garden to look
after, including a 'house' with windows and doors clipped out of yew trees.
Savills is selling it for Pounds 1.2m.
With an acre less, but only Pounds 320,000 from Humberts or John Goodwin, is
the brick Witherdine Farm at Redmarley, 10 miles from Gloucester and two
miles from the M50.
Glebe Farm at Saintbury, between Broadway and Chipping Campden, has 16 acres
and costs Pounds 390,000 from Andrew Grant. Babdown Farm is a Victorian
house near Tetbury with 214 acres (plus the chance to buy more) and barns
with planning permission. It is on offer from Knight Frank & Rutley for
Pounds 850,000.
From its new Cirencester office, John D. Wood is selling the Georgian Ferney
Hill, a handsome house on the west edge of the Cotswolds, for Pounds
450,000. Melksham Court at nearby Stinchcombe is a large example of Cotswold
vernacular, with 36 acres and a fine garden. Price: Pounds 650,000, from
Bennett Jones or Jackson-Stops.
If you fancy a mill, four are on the market. Cheapest is Millers House,
outside Lechlade, which is only a part of the mill on the river Leach
(Mallams; offers over Pounds 120,000). The best known is Arlington Mill, on
the river Coln and next to the trout farm in the much-visited village of
Bibury. It was set up as a museum in 1966 and, if the buyer wants to keep
that, some of the contents may be for sale. Lane Fox is asking Pounds
250,000.
The same agent is selling Siddington Mill, on the river Churn, for Pounds
445,000 and (with Savills) Sheppards Mill, an old woollen mill restored in
1983 at Uley, in the west of the county, for Pounds 395,000.
