FT  23 JUL 93 / Yugoslav government devalues dinar by more than 80 per cent


   By REUTER


The Yugoslav government yesterday devalued the dinar by more than 80 per
cent to help deal with a sanctions-related economic slump and soaring
inflation, Reuter reports.
The new rate was set at 13.6m dinar per dollar, up from 2.4m. That
represents a fall of 82.35 per cent in the dinar's value against the US
currency and it was the eighth dinar reduction since April 1992. The deputy
prime minister, Mr Jovan Zebic, announced the devaluation shortly after the
flourishing black market exchange rate for the dollar peaked at 15.5m
dinars, around 12 times more than the largely meaningless official rate.
