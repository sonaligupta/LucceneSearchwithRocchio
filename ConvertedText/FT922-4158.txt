   VIENNA


The Vienna parliament yesterday agreed to Italy's autonomy plan for the
South Tyrol, ending a 46-year dispute over the status of the province,
writes Eric Frey in Vienna. The Austrian government will now notify the
United Nations that the conflict has been formally ended. But Austrian
officials say Vienna will observe closely whether the agreement is fully
implemented.
