FT  12 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Hillsdown profits hampered by poultry but
helped by interest


   By MAGGIE URRY


SIR HARRY Solomon, chair-man of Hillsdown Holdings, said that in the opening
weeks of the current year the group's results were ahead of 1991.
He emphasised Hillsdown's strategy of building on its core food businesses
so that they would be able to compete on a European and North American
basis. He said the cash raised through last autumn's Pounds 280.7m rights
issue gave the group acquisition opportunities.
Last year over-capacity and low prices in the poultry market worked against
Hillsdown, with operating profits from the division down 56 per cent to
Pounds 26.3m. Mr David Newton, group chief operating officer, said that
poultry prices were the lowest seen since 1983 and there had been a flood of
imports, mainly from France.
However, poultry prices had begun to pick up recently, he said, and he
believed the acquisition of JP Wood last month would allow Hillsdown to
build a low-cost producer able to compete on a European scale.
Hillsdown's other activities broadly maintained operating profits. The
pre-tax figure was helped by a lower interest charge, although the rights
money only benefited the last 10 weeks of the year.
Group sales were 10 per cent higher at Pounds 4.66bn and operating profits
were 5.2 per cent down at Pounds 231.7m. A fall in interest charges to
Pounds 44.9m (Pounds 53.3m) curbed the pre-tax profits decline to 2.3 per
cent.
Operating profits from the food processing division rose 16 per cent to
Pounds 137.3m.
In the meat division operating profits rose 12 per cent to Pounds 32m with
margins up from 2.8 per cent to 3.1 per cent. The division includes Strong &
Fisher, the 70 per cent-owned leather group, which moved from loss to
profit.
The furniture division saw a fall from Pounds 16.7m to Pounds 15.1m,
although the main upholstery business maintained profits.
Profits from housebuilding, property trading and other activities were
slightly lower at Pounds 25.5m (Pounds 26.1m).
There was an extraordinary cost of Pounds 19.8m (Pounds 76.1m) which related
to the costs of discontinued activities, partly offset by the Pounds 16.1m
profit on selling the group's stake in Wickes, the DIY retailer.
Following the rights issue, and a placing by Maple Leaf in Canada, the
balance sheet saw a fall in net debt to Pounds 125.8m (Pounds 494.2m).
Shareholders' funds rose to Pounds 807.3m (Pounds 534.7m) and minority
interests were up to Pounds 209.3m (Pounds 155.8m).
A final dividend of 6.6p (6p) is proposed, to give a total of 8.8p (8p).
Mr Kevin O'Sullivan, finance director, was bowing out after yesterday's
annual results. Asked about his successor, Sir Harry said: 'I anticipate
being in a position to make an announcement shortly.'
