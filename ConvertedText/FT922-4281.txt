FT  06 JUN 92 / Letter: Long-term view on apprentices


   From Mr TOM PURVES


Sir, I have followed the correspondence about lack of UK apprenticeship
opportunities with some interest and was particularly struck by the comments
made by Mr Jarrett (May 28).
It is a sad effect of a tough economy that easy options may be taken by
companies seeking to make short-term cost savings. It is a shame that
talented young men and women should be forced to seek apprenticeships in
Germany rather than in the UK.
However, it is my experience that German companies, particularly those with
a very high technology base, have made, and continue to make, such
investments for the long-term benefit of their products and, in the case of
after-sales activities, to fulfil the best possible service for customers.
At BMW (GB), we instituted a comprehensive apprenticeship programme four
years ago, both at our headquarters and throughout our dealer network. We
now have more than 400 apprentices at various stages in their training
across the UK. This is one of the best investments BMW has made. Not only
does the scheme provide us with a highly-trained force of dedicated
technical people, but it also secures for BMW the right people to care for
ever more specialised products. This is particularly important as we enter a
period when demographic data indicate a clear shortage of young people.
Good people like Mr Jarrett will always look to improve their opportunities
by seeking out the best training available. Good companies will always seek
to improve their opportunities by providing the best training. The
successful ones will be those which take the long-term view and recognise
the value of the specialised staff on the ground. Good apprenticeship
programmes meet those needs.
