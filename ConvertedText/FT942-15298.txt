FT  15 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Producers silent on rubber pact
stance


   By REUTER


   GENEVA


Rubber producers at the United Nations-sponsored negotiations here on a new
international accord were yesterday still refusing to outline their position
publicly, reports Reuter from Geneva. And with just one more day to go to
wrap up the 10-day 28-nation conference, observers were suggesting that
might result in delegates having to return home empty-handed.
'It's difficult to say, we're still in discussion. . . I have no details
yet,' said the rubber exporters' spokesperson Ms Rosediana Suharto, director
of the Indonesian Export Training Centre at the country's Department of
Trade.
But experienced negotiators were not entirely negative.
'Just because the producers are not talking doesn't mean they might not try
to strike a last-minute deal in informal discussions,' an official close to
the conference secretariat said.
'If they appear to be agreeing now, they might give away some bargaining
power later on today.' And an African producer delegate said: 'There are not
many disagreements within the producers' group, it's going better than the
cocoa talks'.
But a producer delegate from one of the top three Asian growers was less
hopeful. 'We haven't narrowed it down enough,' he said.
'If we don't get something to deal on by tonight, the talks will have
failed,' European Union representative Mr Derek Taylor said. But he knew of
a number of private consultations later on.
Success or failure depended on just a few articles within the envisaged
treaty, officials said. The two sides still differed on the reference price,
the price range to be defended by buffer stock operations and how to review
and revise the price.
