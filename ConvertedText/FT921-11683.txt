FT  30 JAN 92 / The Disarmament Race: Sense of urgency prompts Bush to adopt
unilateral tactics - US-Soviet control of nuclear weapons


   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent


IN the six months since the US and the Soviet Union signed the Start treaty,
agreeing for the first time to cut their long-range nuclear arsenals, the
whole context of nuclear arms control has been transformed.
That treaty set reductions of about 30 per cent over seven years. When it
was finally signed, after protracted negotiations, US officials had become
dubious about prospects for continuing the process and about the ability of
the Soviet system to absorb more cuts.
The August coup attempt in Moscow brought the first change to that outlook.
Seizing what many thought could be a last opportunity, President George Bush
announced a range of proposals mixed with unilateral gestures in September.
Having previously staved off negotiations with the Soviets on short-range
nuclear weapons deployed with armies in Europe, the US moved to scrap the
weapons altogether.
Other measures included removing tactical nuclear weapons from ships and
standing down from alert the US Air Force's strategic bombers and missiles
due to be scrapped under Start.
Tuesday's proposals reflect this new approach of unilateral and reciprocal
measures in place of negotiations. They are motivated by a clear sense of
urgency. Stockpiles built up to achieve security through a balance of
destructive power have become, in the former Soviet Union, a source of
potential insecurity.
The US has long wanted to tackle the Soviets' multiple-warhead
intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), especially the SS-18, the
biggest weapon in either country's armoury.
Under Start, the number of SS-18s is due to be halved. Mr Bush proposed in
September an agreement to ban land-based ICBMs with multiple warheads
altogether, and his latest proposals are aimed at achieving that.
The SS-18s, based in silos with 10 independent warheads each, are seen as
the most 'destabilising' of weapons, because their launch sites would be
prime targets and the commanders in charge of them would be likely to fire
them off as soon as possible to avoid their destruction.
By contrast, in the US view, submarine-launched weapons, hidden in the
depths of the ocean, are ideal for wielding the threat of riposte to a
nuclear aggressor and are therefore 'stabilising'.
However, this position appeared disingenuous, given that the Soviets held
superiority in land-based ICBMs and the US both numerical and technical
superiority in submarine-launched ballistic missiles. The US deploys 160
10-warhead Poseidon missiles and 480 eight-warhead Trident C-4 and D-5
missiles, making a total of up to 5,440 strategic warheads. Mr Bush's offer
to cut these by a third would bring these numbers roughly into line with
Russia's submarine firepower.
However, the proposed cuts would give the US submarine force a greater
relative weight than now in the nation's 'triad' of nuclear forces - air,
land and sea - all of which are affected by the proposals.
If Russia accepts the proposals, they would mean eliminating 1,500 of the
2,450 warheads on US land-based ICBMs. Plans to deploy the 50 modern MX
Peacekeeper missiles on rail-cars had already been stopped. Now these
10-warhead missiles, able to target different cities, would be eliminated.
The 500 Minuteman III missiles would have their warheads reduced from three
to one, effectively doubling the reduction that was expected under the Start
treaty. Some strategic bombers would be converted to non-nuclear use.
These proposals are in addition to unilateral measures: curtailing the very
expensive B-2 stealth bomber programme, scrapping development of the new US
single-warhead missile known as Midgetman, and halting warhead production
for the Trident D-5.
The main aim of the proposals is to secure the elimination of the SS-18s
based in Kazakhstan and Russia and the modern SS-24s in Russia and Ukraine.
These weapons, known in Nato parlance as 'Satan' and 'Scalpel', amass a
total of more than 4,000 warheads, 1,400 of which were already due to go
under the terms of Start. Also covered would be the more lightweight SS-19
and SS-17, which like the SS-18 were introduced in the mid-1970s, with some
2,000 warheads between them.
Some of Mr Bush's measures, however, are simply a matter of facing up to
hard realities. The cost of Northrop's B-2 bomber had made it a principal
candidate for budget cuts. Planned numbers had already been trimmed from 132
to 75. The production run is now set to stop at 20, resulting in an
estimated cost per aircraft of Dollars 2bn.
The stopping of Trident warhead production - which means that the US will,
for the first time since it has had nuclear weapons, no longer be producing
any warhead - follows a two-year shutdown of the facility at Rocky Flats,
Colorado, where the plutonium cores are produced, pending resolution of
environmental and safety problems.
