Intel, the world's largest semiconductor chip maker, reported record revenue
and earnings for the second quarter. It was the eighth consecutive quarter
the company has achieved revenue and earnings records.
Rising sales of Pentium chips, Intel's latest generation of microprocessors
for use in high-performance personal computers, helped drive second-quarter
growth, the company said. Second-quarter revenue rose 30 per cent to Dollars
2.77bn from Dollars 2.13bn in the same period last year. Net income was up
12 per cent at Dollars 640m, or Dollars 1.46 a share, compared with Dollars
569m, or Dollars 1.30, in last year's second quarter.
Earnings were in line with Wall Street projections.
'We had a solid quarter as growing sales of PCs increased demand for Intel
microprocessors,' said Mr Andrew Grove, president and chief execu-tive.
'We are particularly pleased with the rapid move of Pentium processor-based
systems into the PC mainstream, as we continue to drive the most aggressive
processor ramp in our history.'
During the quarter, PCs using chips produced by Intel's latest process
technology began to reach computer users. Microprocessors produced with this
technology were rapidly becoming the base for the highest performing
volume-produced computers in each segment of the PC market, the company
said.
Revenue increased from first-quarter levels in all geographic markets, with
the Asia-Pacific region and Japan showing the strongest growth rates.
American revenues accounted for 51 per cent of sales; Europe 27 per cent;
the Asia-Pacific region 14 per cent; and Japan 8 per cent.
For the first half of 1994, revenues were Dollars 5.43bn, up 31 per cent
from Dollars 4.15bn in the first half of last year. Net income grew 13 per
cent to Dollars 1.26bn, or Dollars 2.86 per share, from Dollars 1.12bn, or
Dollars 2.53.
