FT  14 APR 94 / Sumitomo plant gunman opens fire


   By AP


   RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, NORTH CAROLINA


A gunman walked into a Japanese-owned fibre optics plant in the US yesterday
and opened fire, killing one person and wounding two others, AP reports from
Research Triangle park, North Carolina.
Authorities evacuated the Sumitomo Electric Fiber Optics plant and combed
buildings for a man identified by witnesses as a recently dismissed
employee.
Police in Durham said they had surrounded the unidentified suspect's home.
The 490-employee Sumitomo plant, which makes optical fibre cable and fiber
optics components, is among the cluster of research, manufacturing and
technical plants in the research park 10 miles west of Raleigh. The company
is a subsidiary of Sumitomo Electric of Japan.
'We looked out over the plant floor - we saw people just running at random.
And it was just a pop, pop, pop. We never did see the guy,' Mr Sid Gregory,
a Sumitomo employee, told a local television station.
Employees were evacuated from the plant but not allowed into the car park to
recover their vehicles, so shuttle buses took some to a nearby cafeteria and
relatives picked up others.
Medical staff confirmed that one person was dead. A man and woman underwent
surgery for multiple gunshot wounds and both were reported to be in serious
condition.
The shooting was reported shortly before 8am at the plant, the local
sheriff's department said.
